null,false,nnth,null,null,null,"Ah I see. You've not understand the tuition fees at all. OK, I will explain.   

You don't pay anything up front. None at all. The debt is in fact not even debt, because you don't have to pay it back unless you earn over £21k. Even then, you pay it back at a marginal rate. That means that you pay it back according to your income. Those on low incomes (21-25k) pay it back very slowly, we're talking £51 per month, if I remember correctly. Interest is pegged to inflation, and so you theoretically never accumulate any interest relative to your salary.   

What does this all mean? It means that the net effect of tuition fees has been no change in student numbers.  Use Google to find the data. Long term the government can (and over the course of the last parliament, has) invested the saved money into poorer pupils (pupil premium). This means that poor kids get a better (free, paid solely by taxpayers, and genuinely progressive because it's open to all pupils) education which will allow them to get the grades to enable them to take advantage of the higher education system. Thus we create a more equal society through equality of opportunity.

See chapter 4 of linked article.

Excerpt:

&gt; The key point to understand about fiscal policy under Cameron and Osborne is that British austerity, while very real and quite severe, was mostly imposed during the coalition’s first two years in power. Chart 3 shows estimates of our old friend the cyclically adjusted primary balance since 2009. I’ve included three sources – the IMF, the OECD, and Britain’s own Office of Budget Responsibility – just in case someone wants to argue that any one of these sources is biased. In fact, every one tells the same story: big spending cuts and a large tax rise between 2009 and 2011, not much change thereafter.

&gt; Given the fact that the coalition essentially stopped imposing new austerity measures after its first two years, there’s nothing at all surprising about seeing a revival of economic growth in 2013.

&gt; Look back at Chart 2, and specifically at what happened to countries that did little if any fiscal tightening. For the most part, their economies grew at between 2 and 4%. Well, Britain did almost no fiscal tightening in 2014, and grew 2.9%. In other words, it performed pretty much exactly as you should have expected. And the growth of recent years does nothing to change the fact that Britain paid a high price for the austerity of 2010-2012.",null,0,null,1430380011,null,0,false,0,cqtmxgy,null,t3_34amyn,null,t1_cqtmxgy,null,t1_cqt3v3o,null,null,null,1432689099,null,5,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,5,null

As for the midfield, I'd quite like to see us bring in someone who's slightly better at passing, a bit like Ben Watson was all those years ago. And still is at Watford. Maybe someone like Will Hughes from Derby, but I think he has been linked with bigger clubs so it's uncertain if he would come or not. 

I don't think we need another centre back, Dann is having a great season and so is Daleney. Also Ward an Kelly are fairly good as left and right backs, haven't fully made my mind up about Soure yet.

Another striker is top of my palace wish list, though. I rate Campbell quite highly, but I'm not sure he's a top half premier league striker and that's where I see us aiming for next year. Gayle looks like he has lost interest in the last few games. Glenn, although absolutely fantastic, is getting on a bit now at 31 so we could do with a younger model.

I used to vote Labour, but they nearly ran the country into the ground last time they were in power, something I've not forgotten or will forgive. 

**Edit:** So apparently I need to clarify the above, let me firstly state that I did not once use the word recession or say that Labour were responsible for the financial crisis. Nor did I imply it. 

Rather, my criticism of them is twofold. Firstly, how they didn't plan for such an eventuality (you would think the recession of the 70's / 80's would still be in mind) but they didn't and they still spent frivolously on largely egregious projects during our 'boom period', by the time the recession hit there's wasn't enough saved for a rainy day. They over spent, massively. 

Secondly, is how they responded to the crisis. What did they do? Cancel, or pause these projects? Act efficiently to mitigate the financial damage the crisis was going to cause?

2) CBT is for both scooters and bikes. It doesn't differentiate [yet]. So if you complete the training, you can ride the other regardless of what you passed on 
But, start on the 125. It'll serve you better to learn to ride a manually geared bike rather than a twist &amp; go. If it looks like you're struggling with the gears, they may move you down to the moped, to see if you have problems with any other aspects.  
Either way, don't worry about it. Even if you don't complete the training, coming back for a second day - where they often just have you come in part way - will either be free or at only a portion of the cost. Ask before booking which they do.

He managed to beat out Bayer Leverkusen to win his first league title during a transitional period for Bayern Munich and then followed that up with another Bundesliga trophy the following year but since Bayern emerged as the force they now are, his Dortmund team have never been able to get near them in the league. There is one team in Germany with a financial advantage over Dortmund and they've just cruised to their 3rd consecutive league title, completely uncontested. There are 4 teams with more financial clout than us in England and no reason to believe Klopp can overcome them.

He has no history of signing big name, star players, nor has he been able to keep hold of his biggest stars at Dortmund. The belief that he's going to come in and bring a flood of established world class players with him is based on absolutely nothing. There is a hierarchy in European football in terms of player pulling power and it'll take more than a change of manager to elevate us above the likes of Bayern, Real Madrid, Barca, Chelsea, Man Utd, City, Arsenal, PSG, Juventus etc (many of whom already have bigger names than Klopp in charge). Players care about how much money you're paying them, the city your club is based in, the prestige of the club (current prestige, history means very little) and the likelihood of success. The clout of the manager is A factor, but not a major one. Does anyone think it was the idea of playing under Manuel Pellegrini (who had won fuck all outside of South America) that led Ronaldo to leave a dominant Man Utd side for Real Madrid? Of course not.

His early transfers at Dortmund were fantastic and laid the foundations for his success there but his recent transfer record has been no better than Rodgers'. Dortmund's summer transfer spending was the highest of any club in Germany, with only Bayern coming close to matching them, and the result has been a disaster of a campaign which sees them 8th in the table, 16 points adrift of the top 4 (and we're furious about being 7 points off 4th in an arguably more competitive league) and 37 off 1st. The more money and freedom he's been given at Dortmund, the worse his transfers and his team have become, so once again, this idea that he's some sort of infallible transfer god is more than a little misplaced.

Before this season began the bookmakers had us down to finish 5th. We're currently 5th. Keep Rodgers and they'll have us down to finish 5th again next season. Bring in Klopp and they'll still have us down to finish 5th next season.

According to Jose Mourinho (I'm on my phone, so I can't find the link) back in 2014, he said that Sky tends to just focus on the PL to the exclusion of everything else, and treats it like top four or bust (or I guess, if England were to lose the top four, it would be top three or bust?). 

I do remember around the time of the Wembley Cup final this year, at the press conference before Chelsea vs Spurs, Mourinho actually said that England's lack of chances in the European cups (be it Europa or Champions League) would affect his job prospects (in terms of being a strong coach in a strong league, and like it or no, Europa is also a part of that competition. Italy and Germany are gaining on us in terms of the coefficient). 

However, Sky treats Europa cup like an also ran competition, and it doesn't help that UEFA, by packing even more teams into the competition under the guise of 'widening European participation' (thanks, Plantini) has made it even more watered down and a slog with the two legged tie and all that. 

With regards to Europa- I think it depends on where you are as a club. A club like Swansea and West Ham would think of Europa as an improvement, because they've moved up X places to do so.

I did not state that any *proportionate* response is illegitimate. It is the massive scale and brutality of the Israeli response that defines it as a war crime from the very start.

Your point fails in other ways. The rockets fired at Israel were the latest in a conflict lasting almost a century and derived from that history. More specifically, Israel is maintaining a belligerent occupation coupled with land-theft and brutalization for at least the last 48 years and is blockading Gaza and killing people *within Gaza* who step into their unilaterally declared kill-zone that encompasses something like 40% of the arable land in Gaza.

Israel is by far the aggressor here and positioning the rocket firing as anything but retaliation is disingenuous.

Every season they seem to struggle in the league but do well in the European group stages and then get knocked out of the Champions League in the early knockout stages and go on a run to secure top 4 and Champions League for the next season.  I've wondered whether they are 'intentionally' dropping out of the Champions League at this point so that they can focus on the league and getting back in to the Champions League to keep the money flowing.

Doing this, they've managed to pay off a huge new stadium and continue to re-invest in top players (though they do also have a policy off selling their best players at top dollar, again turning a profit).

I think (and I've heard this corroborated somewhere that Mike Ashley is taking a similar but less glamorous approach at Newcastle and just ensuring they're in the Premier League each year by giving them enough to secure mid-table mediocrity but no more, and again aiming to make profits on players their, clearly well equipped, scouts unearth.  This, for me, explains why they'd put Pardew on a 8 year deal also.

Again nuanced, but I think FSG are managing Liverpool in a similar way.  Like a lean business, rather than a sporting passion.  I don't think we'll ever see us spend like Chelsea, City or United under their ownership but continue to invest in young players with the potential to be sold on at their peak and aim to over-achieve.

I did not like the last Labour Government at all. I think sometimes it's good to have cycles and experience another party in power. It forces parties like Labour to rethink what they stand for and how they do things. But it also forces the public to experience both sides and question what they stand for as well.


For me it comes down to philosophies. One party puts business first. The other puts the people. I've been around long enough to know that equality is important and makes society better as a whole (even for rich people!). Cutting welfare to save measly sums of money, at the expense of people's quality of life is pointless when the tax system in the country is costing us billions.


Hopefully Labour really have changed and will go for sensible, gradual change and not be reckless like governments before.

Add to this a decent plan for housing, with some big policies like local people getting first dibs etc, I think they have some good policies.

Also, I have really warmed to Miliband. The interview with Russell was a big turning point - he seemed genuine and actually willing to engage, which was great.

What is your attitude to risk?  Are you willing to put everything you own into a high risk fund that *might* make you wealth or *might* leave you penniless?

Do you want short term or long term rewards?  Putting every penny you can into your pension will pay off when you come to retire - but it might mean putting your dreams of owning a house on hold.  Buying a house now means you're gambling on being able to sell it for a profit to fund your retirement.

When you've got all that together, you can start to work out what you want to prioritise.  But you've *got* to do it together.  Too many couples break up over money - usually because they don't talk about their expectations and fail to plan for the future.

And can I just point out that you're much more anti-Rodgers than I am pro-Rodgers by the sounds of it. I'm all for replacing him with Klopp but that's hardly a nailed on thing, it'd be more of a dream appointment. People are getting too emotional about it but the truth is that we'd probably struggle to replace him with someone better due to our circumstances.  

  
I used the words magically and instantly because that's clearly what you've expected from Rodgers so far. This is his third year, in which time we've challenged for the title and rebuilt an old squad inherited from Hodgson. Crazy that you'd be willing to sack him in favour of someone new after that amount of time and what makes you think a new manager will be able to do that Rodgers can't? I'm sure there's reasons but I'm not hearing any.

The Conservatives are at least experienced, and there are some sensible young MP's coming through the ranks. The 1911 committee is dying out. Hopefully a Yes in the EU referendum will finally kill it off. Cameron has already said he wouldn't stand again, which is good because he's toxic to many undecideds, but it's also made him seem weak. Why put up with him another four years when you could boot him out now? Ultimately, coming out of a lingering recession I think it's important that government policy remains stable and consistent.

You seem to be missing the crux of problem here - it is political. The whole point of running as a politician would be trying to solve issues like... I don't know, student debt!

Whereas a more credible party might suggest cutting fees, offering additional grants or what have you, his solution is to pay them for sex (which means we can infer he and his party have no interest in putting forward other policies to help students in debt).

Can you not see the vileness in this itself? Imagine if that was the way all of parliament was run... politicians that offer to solve problems for their constituents if they sleep with them, offer their bodies up for sexual favours or star in porn?

According to the first theory, the MPs own opinions are secondary. If their constituents feel strongly on a certain issue, then the MP is bound to vote according to their wishes - even if she disagrees. The concept of ""writing to ones MP"" lies at the heart of this theory.

According to the second theory, the constituents have elected the MP to make decision *on their behalf*. The opinion of constituents on specific issues is irrelevant. It is the MP's job to educate themselves on the issues, and make appropriate deals to do the best for their constituents, who can't hope to have sufficient depth of knowledge to make informed decisions for themselves.

I'm sympathetic to both ideas. Personally, I would be happy with an MP who honestly followed either course, to the best of her ability. Perhaps the Internet is starting to tip the balance towards former idea, as ordinary people are now much more able to be fully informed than they were in the past.

The Labour party was founded by Trade Unions.  At the time, working people didn't have a voice in Parliament.  Labour used its political might to vote in things like... (in no particular order)

* The minimum wage
* Sick pay - and guaranteed holidays for workers
* Banning of discrimination on grounds of sex, race, religion, sexuality, etc.
* Better maternity pay &amp; leave
* etc

In a very narrow sense, that's ""anti-business"" - although many of us prefer to think of it as ""pro-employee"".

In a broader sense, Labour believe that businesses should be well regulated, and that the tax burden should fall on the richest people and businesses in order to ensure a higher standard of living for everyone.

At 21, you can do your A2 licence. This will allow a bike up to ~47bhp.  
A 125cc is good to 'cut your teeth on', but depending on how you'll be commuting to uni, it could get restrictive.  
I'd also recommend looking into getting extra lessons and the bike as soon as you can. If you do your CBT now, and don't plan to be back on a bike again until September, you'll have forgotten pretty much everything.  
Plus, you'll miss out on the summer riding, which is where most of the fun is.

But, there's no normal progression.

Sure. But I think the question is more how many people who favour independence would be prepared to vote for devo-max?

I suspect the answer would be ""almost all of them"". If all you want is devo-max then you'll vote for devo-max, if what you really want is independence but you're given the chance to get significantly closer to independence then you'll also vote for devo-max.

&gt; I think you're also underestimating the level of political thinking in Scotland just now - its crazy how different the environment is up here compared to England.

Oh, I know, that's where I live too… ;)

&gt; But you're right - people felt very let down by Cameron and the Tories. The way they back tracked is laughable and this EVEL is just pushing Scotland closer to Independence IMO. Its funny to see how much Ruth Davidson (Scottish Tory leader) has distanced herself from Cameron and his campaign of English Nationalism.

Agree on both points. The Conservatives are behaving in a way that's almost the opposite of how they were during the referendum, and they're getting dangerously close to pushing an ""anti-Scotland"" message even if they try and qualify it with anti-SNP. In some cases, like the proposed budget pre-vote or the Carlisle principle, it's clearly not about the SNP - it's about Scottish MPs (whatever party they're from) and the basic concept of devolution.

Personally I think the explanation is that they're assuming the union will dissolve within the next couple of decades. At some point it becomes more important to manoeuvre yourself into a good position for when that does happen, rather than to keep claiming that it can't possibly happen.

Labour are probably thinking similar things internally, but because of their previous base in Scotland they're not able to cut ties quite so blatantly.

[This post](http://ericjoyce.co.uk/2015/03/a-real-scottish-labour-party/) about rebooting Scottish Labour into a new pro-independence Labour-ish party puts some numbers to that:

&gt; Second, though, if the SNP secures over 40 seats and labour well under 20, then the unionist game is probably a bogey. The only way to get traction for a coherent Labour vision for Scotland, whatever that might be, may be to accept the inevitability of independence and actively campaign for it.

That's an existing Labour MP, writing less than eight weeks ago, when it looked like Labour might actually hold on to 10-20 seats.",null,0,null,1430389049,null,0,false,0,cqtox5i,null,t3_349ce4,null,t1_cqtox5i,null,t1_cqtonzo,null,null,null,1432690038,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The problem is that in trying to implement that they have come up with polices which demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of how the market works and which will hurt businesses to the detriment of the entire country (e.g energy price freeze).

To contrast them to the Tories for OP, both parties have basically the same ultimate aim (despite what some people on this sub will tell you about them wanting babies to starve to death). However the difference is rather than achieving it though state controlled re-distribution of wealth the Tories believe that the way to improve living standards across the board is through private economic growth, this generally means reducing burdens on businesses in theory to allow them to thrive, employ more people etc.

However the core underlying ideology of both parties doesn't mean much any more, especially in this election and you are far better looking at the polices the parties are proposing and how they will effect you.

That would be silly since it didn't apply to Northern Ireland, which is why Westminster had to resort to blackmailing us via fines to subvert the democratic process in place here.

&gt;You are aware that no party got a majority at the last General Election, yeah?

Right... so the Tories brought in the Lib Dems, giving them a combined 358 seats, since even if all 18 of our MPs had gone into coalition with them, it still wouldn't have been enough to secure a majority.

&gt;And that no party is likely to get one this time?

And the same thing will happen again, the largest party will bring in as few other parties as it can to get it over the line and the rest will be irrelevant.

Even in a hung parliament it takes very narrow and specific circumstances for them to matter.

null,false,Froolow,null,null,null,"Depends a little bit what you mean by 'anti-business'. In the most obvious sense, no mainstream UK political party (apart from the Greens, sometimes) comes anywhere close to disagreeing with various shades of 'neoliberalism', which is an economic policy associated with mostly free markets with a little bit of state interference to make sure those markets don't crash all the time (sometimes in very obvious way like bailing out banks during the financial crisis, sometimes in less obvious ways like enforcing patent laws to give companies an incentive to innovate). Within that definition, no major party is 'anti-business' - they all agree with the paradigm that businesses are really important to the health of the nation, but disagree slightly on the details of exactly how much tinkering they need to do to the market to prevent it from crashing.

Labour's rhetoric is tending towards more interventionist that the Conservatives. For example Labour is talking about capping profits made from NHS contracts and limiting electricity suppliers' ability to create confusing pricing structures. On the other hand, Labour have proposed some policies which are unequivocally pro-business - for example extending the right to free childcare, which acts as a transfer of wealth from the taxpayer to businesses (in fairness, the Tories have proposed this too).

So it is way too simplistic to say that Labour are 'anti-business' and leave it at that. Labour are very keen on private ownership of businesses, and are no doubt extremely grateful for the corporation tax such businesses bring in. It is *probably* true to say that Labour are slightly more interventionist than the Conservatives (and hence tend to side with the employee over the business in marginal cases), but when you look at the entire philosophical space which political parties could occupy when it comes to business, Labour and the Conservatives are actually very close together.",null,0,null,1430389684,null,0,false,0,cqtp2ad,null,t3_34dthq,null,t1_cqtp2ad,null,t3_34dthq,null,null,null,1432690105,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

They invested the proceeds from the sale into other financial instruments which were expected to reduce volatility by the Treasury, so it was hardly done on a whim.

We balance each other out, but yes, I dont like the man. Talks shit, and delivers the same on the pitch. Out of his depth at LFC. Well, that's what I expect from a man who thinks a Swansea play-off is the biggest game and cant be pipped even by a CL final. Great man, great great man. Someone who we want leading us. 

&gt; People are getting too emotional 

So, you dont celebrate a goal? A win? Perhaps you dont seem bothered we lose to Villa in a Semi? Cut the crap and stop acting like some cold calculated suave cat. Football is an emotional sport. People who deny this are hypocrites. Be it a manager, a goal, a game, a card a tackle. It will be viewed with emotional angle. 

&gt; we'd probably struggle to replace him with someone better 

Very clever statement specially when you consider Klopp is available. Unless you are Brendan or his mum. 

&gt; I used the words magically and instantly because that's clearly what you've expected from Rodgers so far.

You're free to think so. But then, I'm free to call you deluded and putting words in peoples mouths. 

&gt; This is his third year, in which time we've challenged for the title and rebuilt an old squad inherited from Hodgson.

And lost to Villa, Hull, mighty West Ham, Besiktas, rolled over the in CL, rolled over in the EL, looked clueless, played players out of position with regularity, got the mental strength of a wet cardboards, spoken buffoonish things in the media, laughed at teams spending 100million and then made a joke of ourselves, been outthought and bamboozled by Sherwood, Allardyce and the formidable Steve Bruce and Alan Pardew etc. 

&gt; Crazy that you'd be willing to sack him in favour of someone new after that amount of time

Crazy to think deludes are still seeking out defenses for him and not seeing the signs on the pitch. 

&gt; I'm sure there's reasons but I'm not hearing any.

You will, if you remove your fingers from your ears and stop yelling Brendan Brendan LALALLA. But before that, you'd have to acknowledge there's a problem with Rodgers, but that would account to blasphemy. I'm not holding my breath anyway.

Interesting, what do you make of the Tory promise of a referendum on leaving the EU? 

I mean obviously it's a play to win back protest votes from UKIP at a time when UKIP's ~25% in the polls was seriously hurting at CCHQ, and arguably maybe it's worked. Maybe they would have dropped back anyway, who knows. 

But I was staggered they'd go that far - ""the party of fiscal responsibility"" chucking away our biggest economic link with the outside world.  
I mean, to be fair, it's only democratic to at least allow a referendum even if I personally don't like the outcome, but I feel like there's so much FUD around the EU (and bullshit in the papers) that the public wouldn't necessarily be making a choice with all the facts to hand. 

My prediction is that perhaps it'd go down a lot like the independence referendum north of the border - all kinds of political heavyweights and corporate big beasts would come out of the woodwork saying ""this is economic suicide, we'll be less successful alone"" and the establishment wins a comfortable No vote based on scare tactics.  
But I was really surprised that they want to risk it. Maybe they were even privately planning for opposition to Labour rather than seriously planning to win and follow through - and just trying to limit the number of seats lost to UKIP, to try and stay stronger in five years' time.

- I believe the European Union is a dysfunctional mess that has never been capable of serious of reform. I think it holds us back from being a more global economy by signing trade deals with growing parts of the world, and we shouldn't prioritise the one declining part of the global economy. I think our membership fees could be better spent.
- I think immigration should be limited to the highly skilled. I think high housing costs and transport congestion are directly because we're having to run to stand still with population increases. I also dislike how immigration has caused us to get to the situation where hundreds of British people think its reasonable to go off to join the Islamic State. 
- I have been absolutely sickened by recent child abuse scandals, both at parliamentary level, where all the main parties seem to be up to their necks in it and have covered up over the years, and also the lack of a response to the incidents of grooming gangs in Rotherham, Rochdale, Birmingham, Telford, Keighley and the other two dozen cities. It seems this is a massive crime epidemic that the main parties don't want to look into. 
- I feel we live in an increasingly unstable world and it's very important we keep to our commitments to the NATO alliance. None of the other parties have committed to this. 
- I am fed up of how the SNP have managed to get everyone fawning over Scotland, and the continuation of the grossly unfair Barnett Formula. I much prefer UKIP's position of a needs-based formula for each region of the country. An English parliament would also make sure devolution is even-handed and fair.

ITT: Lots of stupid kids that have no idea about Green Policies, just think that green means environmentally friendly and as such must be a good thing. 

Let's have a look at the greens:

&gt; Top-ups [will be] given for people with children or disabilities, or to pay rent and mortgages. No-one will see a reduction in benefits, and most will see a substantial increase. Parents will be entitled to two years’ paid leave from work.

Where's the money going to come from?

&gt; The Greens also want to see “significantly reduced” levels of imprisonment, with jail only used when there is a “substantial risk of a further grave crime” or in cases where offences are so horrific that offenders would be at risk of vigilantes. Prisoners will be given the vote.

Are you nuts? 

&gt; SATS, early years tests and league tables will be abolished, and “creative” subjects given equal parity to the “academic”.

Oh brilliant, lets ignore STEM and put more emphasis on 'creative' courses. Basically breeding a bunch of Tublrinas.

&gt; Tuition fees will be abolished – but state research funding for universities will increase to reduce a reliance on “biased” commercial research.

Where's the money going to come from?

&gt; No more new airports or runways will be built, and existing ones nationalised. All new homes and businesses must by law provide bicycle parking. Helicopter travel would be regulated “more strictly”. The sale of alcohol on planes and airports will be tightly restricted to prevent air-rage, and the air on inbound flights tested for disease.

If you think Heathrow is bad now, wait until it's nationalised.

&gt; Assisted dying will be legalised, and the law on abortion liberalised to allow nurses to carry it out. “Alternative” medicine will be promoted. Private healthcare will be more heavily taxed, with special levies on private hospitals that employ staff who were trained on the NHS.

If alternative medicine worked, it would be recommended by doctors with education, not a bunch of hippies that thinks placing some rocks on your stomach will cure your cancer.

&gt; Taxes would be higher, much higher, and international aid would be increased by 50 per cent.

Yes, with all this money being thrown around, do you people have any idea where they're going to get it from? US!!! Tax payers! (maybe not people ITT claiming they're going to vote for greens, because they're either students studying some poxy degree like Sociology or women's studies or they're fucking delusional, living in a little hug box unaware of how the Country is run).

&gt; It will be a criminal offence, with “significant fines”, to stop a woman from breastfeeding in a restaurant or shop, and formula milk will be more tightly regulated.

Why not let the owners of the business decide, it's their choice. 

&gt; Merely being a member of al-Qaeda, the IRA and other currently proscribed terrorist groups will no longer be a criminal offence under Green plans, and instead a Green Government should seek to “address desperate motivations that lie behind many atrocities labelled ‘terrorist’,” the policy book states.

yea, because hugging them will work! We're already a bastion for terrorism, with many of them home grown...let's just make it worse shall we?

&gt; Britain will leave NATO, end the special relationship with the US, and unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons. A standing army, navy and airforce is “unnecessary”. Bases will be turned into nature reserves and the arms industry “converted” to producing windturbines.

Words can't even.

&gt; A Green Government will “progressively reduce” border controls, including an amnesty for illegal immigrants after five years.

Sounds great...if you think housing is an issue now, wait until that house of 20 adults living illegally want social housing of their own. 

&gt; Access to benefits, the right to vote and tax obligations will apply to everyone living on British soil, regardless of passport. The policy book states: “We will work to create a world of global inter-responsibility in which the concept of a ‘British national’ is irrelevant and outdated.”

WHERE THE FUCK IS THE MONEY GOING TO COME FROM??? Welfare is already a huge problem, now they want to give everyone benefits. If you think certain parties pander to the immigrant vote, wait until all of them have a vote. 

&gt; Political parties will be funded by the state, and the electoral system changed. The monarchy will be abolished.

HOW THE FUCK ARE YOU PEOPLE NOT OUTRAGED ABOUT THIS????????????????? THEY....WANT....THE....MONARCHY....ABOLISHED!!!!! Have you any idea how much fucking money they bring into this country from tourism. 

Finance and Tourism are 2 of our biggest import/exports and they want to get rid of THE biggest money bringer. 

Don’t be fooled by these people.
Everything about the Greens is nasty and vindictive: the politics of envy spurred on by a disdain for everything that makes Britain what it is.
They look harmless but the reality is that the Greens are the new Reds.

null,false,Reddit_Becoming_Digg,null,null,null,"&gt; Let's have a look at the greens:


&gt; Top-ups [will be] given for people with children or disabilities, or to pay rent and mortgages. No-one will see a reduction in benefits, and most will see a substantial increase. Parents will be entitled to two years’ paid leave from work.

Where's the money going to come from?

&gt; The Greens also want to see “significantly reduced” levels of imprisonment, with jail only used when there is a “substantial risk of a further grave crime” or in cases where offences are so horrific that offenders would be at risk of vigilantes. Prisoners will be given the vote.

Are you nuts?

&gt; SATS, early years tests and league tables will be abolished, and “creative” subjects given equal parity to the “academic”.

Oh brilliant, lets ignore STEM and put more emphasis on 'creative' courses. Basically breeding a bunch of Tublrinas.

&gt; Tuition fees will be abolished – but state research funding for universities will increase to reduce a reliance on “biased” commercial research.

Where's the money going to come from?

&gt; No more new airports or runways will be built, and existing ones nationalised. All new homes and businesses must by law provide bicycle parking. Helicopter travel would be regulated “more strictly”. The sale of alcohol on planes and airports will be tightly restricted to prevent air-rage, and the air on inbound flights tested for disease.

If you think Heathrow is bad now, wait until it's nationalised.

&gt; Assisted dying will be legalised, and the law on abortion liberalised to allow nurses to carry it out. “Alternative” medicine will be promoted. Private healthcare will be more heavily taxed, with special levies on private hospitals that employ staff who were trained on the NHS.

If alternative medicine worked, it would be recommended by doctors with education, not a bunch of hippies that thinks placing some rocks on your stomach will cure your cancer.

&gt; Taxes would be higher, much higher, and international aid would be increased by 50 per cent.

Yes, with all this money being thrown around, do you people have any idea where they're going to get it from? US!!! Tax payers! (maybe not people ITT claiming they're going to vote for greens, because they're either students studying some poxy degree like Sociology or women's studies or they're fucking delusional, living in a little hug box unaware of how the Country is run).

&gt; It will be a criminal offence, with “significant fines”, to stop a woman from breastfeeding in a restaurant or shop, and formula milk will be more tightly regulated.

Why not let the owners of the business decide, it's their choice.

&gt; Merely being a member of al-Qaeda, the IRA and other currently proscribed terrorist groups will no longer be a criminal offence under Green plans, and instead a Green Government should seek to “address desperate motivations that lie behind many atrocities labelled ‘terrorist’,” the policy book states.

Yea, because hugging them will work! We're already a bastion for terrorism, with many of them home grown...let's just make it worse shall we?

&gt; Britain will leave NATO, end the special relationship with the US, and unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons. A standing army, navy and airforce is “unnecessary”. Bases will be turned into nature reserves and the arms industry “converted” to producing windturbines.

Words can't even.

&gt; A Green Government will “progressively reduce” border controls, including an amnesty for illegal immigrants after five years.

Sounds great...if you think housing is an issue now, wait until that house of 20 adults living illegally want social housing of their own.

&gt; Access to benefits, the right to vote and tax obligations will apply to everyone living on British soil, regardless of passport. The policy book states: “We will work to create a world of global inter-responsibility in which the concept of a ‘British national’ is irrelevant and outdated.”

WHERE THE FUCK IS THE MONEY GOING TO COME FROM??? Welfare is already a huge problem, now they want to give everyone benefits. If you think certain parties pander to the immigrant vote, wait until all of them have a vote.

&gt;Political parties will be funded by the state, and the electoral system changed. The monarchy will be abolished.

HOW THE FUCK ARE YOU PEOPLE NOT OUTRAGED ABOUT THIS????????????????? THEY....WANT....THE....MONARCHY....ABOLISHED!!!!! Have you any idea how much fucking money they bring into this country from tourism.
&gt; Finance and Tourism are 2 of our biggest import/exports and they want to get rid of THE biggest money bringer.

Don’t be fooled by these people. 

Everything about the Greens is nasty and vindictive: the politics of envy spurred on by a disdain for everything that makes Britain what it is. 

They look harmless but the reality is that the Greens are the new Reds.

CJ381 Recognising the nature of the female prison population, with high levels of mental illness, experience of being a victim of crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence, and caring responsibilities for children, the only women who should be in custody are those very few that commit serious and violent crimes and who present a threat to the public.

CJ382 For the vast majority of women in the criminal justice system, solutions in the community are more appropriate. Community sentences must be designed to take account of women’s particular vulnerabilities and domestic and childcare commitments. The restrictions placed on sentencers around breaches of community orders must be made more flexible.

CJ383 Existing women’s prisons should be replaced with suitable geographically dispersed, small, multi-functional custodial centres.

null,false,sdsrage,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,null,"&gt;What makes you buy a chocolate (e.g. the taste, packaging, etc)?

Taste and general craving for something fatty and sugary.  If I'm buying for myself, then it'll usually be something cheap like Cadburys, Galaxy or supermarket brands.  If I'm buying to share with family or co-workers, then I'll get something with a wide variety of flavours (Milk Tray, Celebrations, Quality Street). If I am buying it for someone else as a gift (or if I'm really treating myself), then I'll spend more on a better brand, like Hotel Chocolat, Montezuma, or Lindt.  With Hotel Chocolat, it's not so much the packaging (which is simple and minimal), but the way the actual chocolate looks and tastes.  Thortons is a popular chocolate store on the high street but I personally don't like any of their chocolates.  


&gt;What do you think is missing in the UK chocolate market?

I'm not sure, I think we have most things covered, especially since we have access to a lot of brands from the continent.  Asian brands are rare outside of speciality Asian supermarkets.


&gt;Do you buy your chocolates from a convenience store or the supermarket? And which supermarket/ convenience store in specific? 

Generally supermarkets, like Tesco, Asda, and Sainsburys.  Also Lidl and Aldi where I can get cheap European chocolate.


&gt;What are your opinions and inherent perceptions on Asian Chocolates suppose an Asian brand were to enter the UK market (in specific a Singaporean brand)?

I have very limited experience of Asian chocolate brands.  I've had Meiji and Lotte, both are fine but nothing to write home about.  Chocolate in China is vile.  I don't think your average person would have *any* opinion of Asian chocolate.  

If an Asian brand were to enter the market, it would have to be unique but appealing in some way, otherwise I'm not sure how it would compete with all of the other chocolate brands.  Playing up the fact that it's Asian or specifically Singaporean  wouldn't necessarily help, as they're not particularly known for their sweets.

Of course it would be a good idea to ensure spare rooms are used when we have a housing crisis, but how you go about solving that, and who you affect along the way are perfectly reasonable and empathetic things to consider. 

As for the EU referendum, if you fancy a direct democracy then fair enough.  Some people think that the public should have more say on direct policy making.  Others, given the countless times it has been shown that the public get the key facts and figures wrong, would advocate political reform such that experts dictate policy.  If we had a referendum for everything, we would have capital punishment and a quarter of benefits claimants being scroungers.

What does live within our means even mean?  It sounds like something a household owner would say.  Even then, what you said after that is completely against the idea of austerity we have now and would continue to have under a Tory government. 

Do immigrants put a burden on our welfare state and social housing?  This just seems to be taken as fact now and it is becoming increasingly tedious.  It is a positive confirmation for a lot of people's prejudices and it is the real reason why we are not having a proper debate on that matter.  IF it is a problem and IF there isn't a fairer way of solving the problem (build more fucking social housing) then fair enough, but what everyone seems to be doing is hearing ""there is a problem"" and because they dislike wor Maciej the Pole down the road they think it must be true.  All I see is EU migrants, which are the main target of the anti-immigration movement at the moment, providing a net 30% economic benefit to the country that COULD be spent on increased public services and social housing.  The jury is still well and truly out on the idea that such an influx of immigrants negatively affects the low-skill labor market, but I would listen to such appeals from a party who ACTUALLY give a shit about working class issues and doesn't just spout mindless populism in order to nab working class votes.

All of what you said sounds like it is coming from the mouth of a party spokesperson.  Where was the critical thought?  Where is the evidence that any problems this hopes to solves exists?  Where is the bigger picture on how such policies affects everyone?

By all means denounce all this as Tory bashing, because it somewhat is giving your shill-like post on a 17 day old account, but the very same goes for people who mindlessly vote Labour because of ""muh NHS"" or ""muh evil Tories"".

Either way, it might make a small difference, but still think its creepy if its some stunningly attractive guy.

It's a technicality but it probably isn't. Much of the highway code is only a code and not the law, those bits that are the law are given the statute that enforces them in the Code (IIRC). So, can you just disobey it? Well not really, what it means is that if you're not acting consistent with the Code then you're *likely* to be, for example, driving with due care and attention which *is* an offence under the one of the Traffic Acts.

&gt;""Although failure to comply with the other rules of The Highway Code will not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted, The Highway Code may be used in evidence in any court proceedings under the Traffic Acts (see The road user and the law) to establish liability. This includes rules which use advisory wording such as ‘should/should not’ or ‘do/do not’."" (Highway Code, [Introduction](https://www.gov.uk/highway-code/introduction), 2015).

IMO sometimes it is appropriate to creep out in order to avoid never getting let out. Really the drivers on the main road in a high traffic density situation should cede passage to you out of fairness. In other words if it's nose-to-tail on the road you're turning on to and no-one is letting you out then creeping out will force their hand -- they can either choose to drive in to your vehicle or let you out. Regardless of whether you're legally in the right to move out they are definitely legal in the wrong when they choose to drive in to you.

tl;dr pedantry.

I mean, the economy's doing pretty well. There are more jobs almost everywhere - more created in the north east than in the whole of france etc... All my friends from all different backgrounds seems to be doing a lot better than they were. Things are going a lot better for a large section of the population, and I have no doubt if the economy continues growing things will get even better. What makes the difference to people's lives is the availability of jobs.

&gt; Bedroom tax

Okay, I'll explain why I support it. I have a lot of friends who live on council estates with their families. One of them is living mum, dad, nan, sister, brother, him in a 2 bedroom house. They were on a waiting list for 2 years then they got offered a horrible, damp, 3 bed miles out of the area. Meanwhile, below them lives a woman who's kids have moved out and husband left on her own in a 4 bed flat. Is it reasonable to say that woman, given the option of a smaller property within a certain geographic area, should move or pay for the extra space? Yes it is. If you live in a council house it's not yours, it's for the person who needs it most. And if you want to keep it, you can pay for it and the proceeds can be put back into helping other people who need it!

I also agree we need to be building more social + affordable housing, but Labour/LD are no better on this front than Tories.

&gt; As for the EU referendum...

Democracy is compromise. Get the facts out on the table then let people vote. All I'm hearing is 'people might do the wrong thing!' like some communist diktat of 'experts' would be better. If you like democracy then you agree with the will of the people being the be all and end all. I would most likely vote to stay in the EU.

&gt; Do immigrants put a burden on our welfare state and social housing? 

Have looked at plenty of stats &amp; figures in the past and I believe they do. The question you should be asking isn't 'do immigrants as a whole provide a net economic benefit' - that's likely true, but the term 'immigrants' covers everything from headhunted people who move here and pay loads of income tax to people who come here with little reasonable prospect of work. We can have one type without the other. Some immigrant provide a net benefit to the country - I want loads of these, whether it's doctors or mechanics or whatever. I don't want an influx of low-skilled, very little reasonable prospect of getting a job (and if they do it'll be low-skilled taking jobs away from the poorest/disabled who need them)  labour into the market.

Oh, cmon, that's massively different, and I'm certain you know it.  
Two guys/girls kissing is just between them. This is him approaching several women a day.


If *every single girl this guy approaches* is fine with it, then I guess I don't have a problem, but do you really think that's the case here?  
You think it'll only be me white knighting not liking it and every single girl on campus doesn't mind? Or even just the ones he approaches, none of them have a problem?  

Though I'd argue even the ones he isn't approaching are involved as well. He's still judging them all too, purely on attractiveness and deciding not to approach them because he doesn't fancy her, or his audience won't go for a fat/Asian/freckled/short girl.  

And anyway, tbh, I think I'm within my rights to find two girls kissing weird if I like aren't I? As long as I don't infringe on their right to do it in any way, I can think its gross, or they're going to hell, or even be turned on by it if I like.

I am happy that yourself and people you know are doing well but I am not voting based on what a few family and mates are struggling with though.

Glad we could agree that more social housing would fix the problem though but arguably Labour/LD are better (not much) because they aren't the ones advocating more right to buy nonsense (which my family has personally benefited, but is again irrelevant to the bigger picture).  Also the LDs are advocating more housing as far as I remember.

&gt; Have looked at plenty of stats &amp; figures in the past and I believe they do.

Please do link them, I have plenty of stats and figures showing that showing that very very few immigrants rely on the welfare system, even the Torygraph agrees with that one.  I also don't see why having 30% more in tax revenue cannot be spent on social housing.  The one (maybe) problem was miscalculating how many immigrants were going to arrive so that there was an inertia of expanding certain public services which could not meet demand.  This I accept.  

Saying we can have one type without the other is a very bold assertion and requires significant evidence for me to support.  Yes you can prevent (with significant expense) low skill migrant immigration, but the number of skilled migrants that you will get given the now lack of freedom of movement has been shown to drop.  Australia is not some bastion of ""one true"" immigration policy.  It has already been shown that tighter controls aimed to keep low value immigrants out ultimately costs the economy: http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/05/visa-restrictions-overseas-students-costing-uk"".  It also doesn't matter if you ""don't want an influx of low-skilled"" migrants, there is no evidence to suggest that even them are costing the UK economy.  Again, the only people I will listen to on such issues are those who actually advocate working class policies and have evidence on that matter.  Ultimately, you shouldn't go restricting freedom of movement, which from the EU is a net 30% economic benefit, without evidence that it will fix things.  It is all well and good hoping for highly skilled, high tax paying immigrants only, but you need evidence based policy which shows a way of doing so efficiently and fairly whilst not losing the benefits that such freedom already gives.

Apologies for the rudeness, I am very interested to hear what evidence you have as I am still up for changing my vote.  I just get the distinct impression from the initial post that you haven't given it much thought with little evidence to back up what you said.  Ultimately, I couldn't give two shits who you vote for, but I do give a shit, perhaps too much, when people vote without thinking.

lambo - bought as a back up, been good for him to be home, he made some good money and scored a couple big goals. if he stays, no problem. if he's sold for game time, i'll be cheering forhim. 

marko - like you said, unbelievably high ceiling. he is fast, he is a good dribbler. to the surprise of many, he has a finish in him too. over the season, he needs to gain some strength and continue to work on his fitness. his technique is good, it's his decision making that needs some sharpening. next year will be a huge year for him as i think he will get to play in a more advanced role more often. seems like rodgers protected him this year, but i see him getting let loose afterwards. 

balotelli - enough said. i love the guy and think he wouldn't be the worst person to keep around for another season, but BR is done with him im pretty sure. 

lovren - big year for him next year. he is a good cb, now starting to show to little too late for this season. sahko lovren partnership? lovren skrtel? sahko skrtel? don't know who starts now. 

moreno - starter nxt year. has some work to do, but another of our young players showing some serious promise. 

manq - i've heard the same thing and hve been saying it on here for a while...i think liverpool rate him but want to avoid a recall this summer at all costs. i think manquillo performed well when he played...im actually curious if the loan has an appearances clause (if he appears more than x number of times, we will automatically recall). 

origi - i think he stays with us. rodgers can loan out sinclair to give him experience (1.5 years younger than origi too). i think rodgers wants origi in the squad though, he wanted him this season but just couldn't hve him. the way rodgers talks about divock, you get the feeling he's gonna be with us.

Some landlords might be gouging their tenants, and so be able to absorb the reduction in their rent, but most landlords aren't making 25% profit (I assume, otherwise everyone would be doing it). Those landlords will probably want to sell their houses for a large amount of one-off capital, and then invest it in the stock market (or something - depends on the rate of return and various other factors). If they are selling their houses, the people living in £2000 / month accomodation need somewhere to live. They will naturally turn to the only other type of house in London - the £1000 / month properties. Because the people currently living there can only offer £1000 / month, and the people trying to move in can offer as much as £2000 / month (although obviously it caps at £1500), current occupants of £1000 / month housing will be displaced - I would guess away from London where there is a less severe housing shortage.

There are a couple of effects that could increase the housing stock - landlords subdividing £2000 / month houses into £1000 / month houses, or people previously renting buying homes that landlords are selling, but ultimately I think the pipe is nescessarily going to be 'leaky' - more homes will be lost than built, because capping rent makes owning housing stock relatively less attractive.",null,0,null,1430397048,null,0,false,0,cqtraib,null,t3_34drs7,null,t1_cqtraib,null,t1_cqtqx41,null,null,null,1432691166,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

This is in case your local parish has to repair the local church...
If your house falls into a certain area then the church can demand you pay a share of the costs, which could be 1000's of pounds.

You can do a search when buying the property to see if your house falls in one of these areas, I think it costs around £30.
But if you are in the area you will be liable to contribute to repairs.
So most people don't bother doing the search and just get the insurance which costs about £60 for as long as you live in the property.

Word of advice: If you do rent it out, issue a Section 21 notice the date the tenant signs the tenancy dated for the end of the 6 month AST. It speeds up the repossession process by 2 months should you end up with a problem tenant or decide you want to sell.

null,false,keozen,yorkshire,West Yorkshire,null,"Point 1 from the video)

**King George only owned all that land because he enslaved the country and wrote the laws to say MINE!**

And? We came out of a Monarchy, that's how things worked. Like it or not all ""owned"" land everywhere ever is ""owned"" because someone says ""bagsy!"" and is stubborn enough to see it through until a legal system is wrapped around it. You can hate the history and method used to get to the point where he owned the land all you like but he did, legally. 

Point 2:

**He didn't give over ALL his land and the debt also went over to the government which isn't listed in that graphic (oh and their tax free status)**

The debt may have been missing from the infographic but it's implied in the speech that this is the case and £200m debt one off for these revenues forever, pfft easy. Ohh and he didn't give over ALL of his land? No, he didn't. But why is this relevant considering point 1. Tax free status is a completely separate issue, they probably should pay it, campaign for that all you like.

Point 3:

**The ~~science~~ Maths bit**

Ok, you can't just add the amount of tax the royals would have paid into this equation as a cost, it's not a cost. It's money you may have had but didn't, we're not PAYING them anything so putting it into the equation doesn't make sense (also I agree with the tax thing, it's a separate issue, see above). Also added in as a cost is what the guy thinks the crown COULD get for the land if they weren't ""bad at business"", that DOES NOT belong as a cost on the left hand side of his diagram, if it belongs ANYWHERE it belongs as a ghost figure over the top of the right hand side income to show what the maximum theoretical potential of the income could be. It is however NOT a cost, no one is paying anything so it doesn't belong on the left at all (this guy doesn't understand yields and costs at all). Servicing the debt costs £10 million, fine, pop that on. It still makes hardly any dent in the numbers. 

Point 4:

**France actually trounces us in tourist numbers**

France is also hot &amp; sunny. Truth be told there are so many different factors it's impossible to make a fair assumption enough to rule for either side on this one, it's comparing apples to oranges. It's true that a lot of the attraction for the UK royal places is the royal family (hell, some parts of the world went more mad for Will &amp; Kate's baby than we did) but it's equally impossible to tell what the difference in numbers would be if we suddenly didn't have them.

Point 5:

**Football is a much bigger draw to tourists**

Americans don't give a single shit about football (our football). To countries that DO give a shit they already have their OWN leagues and teams, we have NO unique tourist draw. Are you seriously trying to tell me that football tourism brings in anywhere near the same amount of tourism as the Royals? Most international football tourism is for specific  matches and done by fans trying to be in for the match and gone the next day.

Take a look at Greece as a good case in point, the interest demanded by ""the market"" e.g. pension funds is nearing 27%. That cannot be sustained by anyone for any length of time. 

Now, your typical reddit smart rase will say something like ""Aha! but the UK has it's own currency and can just print more money therefore this is not like Greece"". Well yes, pedantically you are correct, but printing money leads to inflation which is hard to control and once inflation starts really rising (&gt;3%) people start demanding larger pay rises etc..all in all this may take some time to play through ghr system but if you are dependent on external financing (which the UK is) then as the value of your currency falls the whole thing is pretty much the same as austerity just a different way of making people suffer. 

""Aha"", says your seasoned reddit veteran who has possibly also read a bit more on the subject ""Italy and Japan have massive amounts of government debt and they are ok."" This is where the nuance of budgets gets interesting, the Italian government has to run a primary surplus (i.e. before interest payments) in order to pay its bills. 

Also, both Japan and Italy have a massive internal savings glut. Japan especially is heavily reliant on the national post office hoovering up government debt which frankly, is likely to blow up at some point. There's a lot to what is going on in Japan but they are certainly not a role model.

The problem is that most went into the season thinking it would be a transition, and then we had that run in December and January, and people started to think that we should be challenging for the top 4.

In reality we have had 4 managers with their hands on this squad and we are dealing with a bunch of different players, who suit different philosophies.

null,false,governmentyard,null,null,null,"Green. Hull North. Because while I appreciate the realpolitik of voting for a centrist party like Labour who can theoretically curtail the worst excesses of right-wing social stratification masquerading as sensible austerity, we've got an incumbent Labour MP parachuted in 10 years ago who mace their way into the whips office and has in 10 years never voted against her leadership. The whipping system keeps MPs away from committees they have expertise in and drains constituencies of their democratic power. I'm not saying she's a poor representative of her electorate on the whole, but she represents a broken system as much as she represents me. And she'll win however I vote.

The Green candidate locally runs for everything and I've watched him in council elections, during campaigns and protests and marches. He's the only candidate who even mentions a raft of issues that affect me personally, or which I care about, not least of all the environment. And he's the only remotely left of centre candidate.  

There's merit to both tactical voting and voting on policy and this allows me to do both. Because while you might not be able to 'win' your seat for your preferred candidate this election, you can inform the winner and their party of which way the wind is blowing locally, and what it'll take for them to change your mind next time. As John McDonnell said in Hull a few months ago... all those marches didn't prevent us going into Iraq a decade back, but they made one hell of a difference to MPs when it came time for them to vote on Syria. 

It's a long game we play, if we want to play with any effectiveness at all. The Yes Vote in Scotland last year might have 'lost' but they've changed the political landscape there forever.

The continued run of the gold price is a global investment sensation. Recently it broke the $1,500 an ounce barrier for the first time, 30 per cent higher than a year ago. Surely this lays bare the extraordinary foolishness of Gordon Brown’s announcement, 12 years ago this week, that the UK Treasury would sell off some of Britain’s gold holdings?

Actually, no. On this one occasion, Mr Brown’s decision was the right one. Let speculators go gambling on a shiny metal, if they want to. For most governments in rich countries, holding gold remains a largely pointless activity.

With hindsight, of course, Mr Brown could have gained a better price by waiting. At current rates, the $3.5bn the UK received selling bullion between 1999 and 2002 would have been closer to $19bn. The difference at current exchange rates, by the way, would be enough to cover a little over three weeks of the UK’s expected public deficit for the fiscal year 2010-2011 – not negligible, but hardly pivotal.

Mr Brown, his critics say, must be kicking himself. Similarly, the French no doubt still suffer sleepless nights for prematurely taking profit on their Louisiana claim by offloading it to Thomas Jefferson in 1803. And had I put my life savings on Ballabriggs at 20-1 before last month’s Grand National, I’d be writing this on a solid platinum laptop while being sprayed with pink champagne in my new beachfront villa in Barbados.

That is the way of things with speculative assets. The truth is that no one has a good explanation why the gold price is currently where it is. The familiar story – a hedge against inflation or government insolvency – is flatly contradicted by the low yields and inflation expectations in US Treasury bonds. The volatility of gold (and other precious metals – witness the huge drop in silver prices this week) merely underlines the risk of holding it. The $1,500 landmark is a nominal price: had governments listened to the bullion fanatics and loaded up on gold in the last big bull market in the early 1980s, they would still be waiting to earn their money back in real terms.

More substantively, criticism of Mr Brown’s sale also betrays a misunderstanding of why a country such as the UK has gold at all.

In common with most rich nations, the function of British foreign exchange reserves is not for the government to manage wealth on behalf of the country. British citizens do that themselves. The UK does not have a sovereign wealth fund that aims to maximise returns, and nor should it. It is not a big net oil and gas exporter such as Norway – UK net foreign exchange reserves are about $40bn, equivalent to 2 per cent of nominal gross domestic product, while Norway’s sovereign fund has $525bn, equivalent to almost 140 per cent of its GDP.

Nor does the UK pile up foreign assets by persistently selling its own currency to manipulate the exchange rate, as does China. It is notable that the much-vaunted official purchases of gold over the past year are mainly by countries such as China and Russia – and, to a lesser extent, Mexico – with big excess reserves.

UK reserves are there mainly for precautionary reasons – to intervene in currency markets to stop a run on sterling or to pursue monetary policy objectives. Yet gold is badly suited for this task because, despite recent interest from private investors, a large proportion of global above-ground stocks – 18 per cent in 2010 – is still held by governments.

Any attempt to sell off large amounts quickly risks driving down the world price, which is what happened after Mr Brown’s announcement in 1999, leading to an international agreement between central banks to restrict further sales.

A precautionary reserve asset held for intervention purposes whose price is likely to fall the instant it is used to intervene is singularly pointless. Of course, central banks selling into a rising market like today’s may not have the same impact as in 1999, but who knows what demand for gold will be like if and when the intervention is needed?

There remains only one other main reason for governments to hold gold – to set monetary policy by linking the national currency to the gold price. This remains as bad an idea as ever. It would have meant sharply tightening monetary policy since the fall of 2008. This would have been madness.

Private investors, and sovereign wealth funds out to make returns, can punt their money on what they like. If they choose to plonk it down on the blackjack table of the commodity markets, that is their decision. But there is no good reason that governments that hold reserves for purely precautionary purposes should feel the need to follow them.

null,false,TakenByVultures,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,null,"&gt; I suspect Mr Vultures drives everywhere 

Not true. I do drive, but rarely into the city centre. Parking is a nightmare. I'll usually head in by bus or tram. 

&gt;Exactly, and it was right there in the middle of the bloody city, with thousands of people walking past it.

This sort of contradicts your point then. Passing footfall has no impact on success?

&gt;He even cites Gorilla as a nearby attraction. That used to be called Cockatoo (or something ) and before that was a good Italian restaurant. But it was 50 foot off Oxford Road. No one could be arsed going there. 

Gorilla is regularly packed out though, as is the Ritz? You're comparing HOME to an empty shopping centre on the other side of the city centre (which I suspect was more to do with the actual offering *inside* the centre, rather than location), rather than to other arts venues which it's actually in proximity to. 

Again, I think you're confusing offering with location. If something is worth going to, people will bother. That's why one of Manchester's most renowned restaurants lived on a quiet estate in Prestwich for many years. That's why MOSI is one of Manchester's most popular attractions despite being *well* off the beaten path. It's why Sankeys sells out most weekends dspite being in the middle of Ancoats, near literally *nothing* else. How do you explain this?

Anyway, I've pored over the legislation to get a definitive answer, [Table 35(3) here (TSRGD)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/307152/draft-tsrgd-schedules.pdf) says to refer to Table 36(5,6,7,9) which relevant parts each has a clause using language like so:

&gt;""[No vehicle shall] Enter that major road or roundabout, so as to be likely to endanger the driver of or any passenger in any other vehicle or to cause that driver to change the speed or course of his vehicle in order to avoid an accident.""

So in order to not comply with the give way markings one would need to move your vehicle in to the other road so as to force another driver to either change speed or direction to avoid crashing. This means that in a heavy traffic situation (traffic jam) provided you edge out whilst the vehicle you're moving in front of is stationary, or in such a way as that if they continue in direction and speed you'll be able to safely pass then you haven't breached the letter of the regulations which the appropriate Act includes.

From this I conclude that in the terms of the RTA that edging out is not unlawful of itself (but could be done in an unlawful way). DWDCA is defined in S.3ZA(2) RTA 1988, edging out doesn't fit there as it's something that a competent and careful driver can be reasonable expected to do.

Me? Liberal or Green. I think the liberals are the best option for us, and I do like some aspects of the greens. Admittedly all of this anti Milliband propaganda is making me want to vote for him.

I live in a previously strong liberal stronghold, but that may change shortly. So not a damn clue as Labour, Liberals, and Greens all have their merits, as do the Conservatives (Perhaps even UKIP). 

However, I just don't trust the Conservatives to make rational decisions based on their actions so far.

I don't agree with all of the Green policies, nor do I believe they are currently ready to run the country, but they have some interesting and valuable policies that need enacting soon. Labour doesn't have as many policies that appeal to me, but it seems that they have a decent rational plan that they intend to follow (I may not like it, but it should work).

BRITAIN is a midsized island with outsized influence. Its parliamentary tradition, the City’s global role, the union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, membership of the European Union and a history of leading revolutions in economic policy mean that British elections matter beyond Britain’s shores. But few have mattered more than the one on May 7th, when all these things are at stake.





It is the strangest, closest general election for many years.
Though you would never know it from the campaigns’ petty squabbling, the country is heading for profound and potentially irrevocable change. The polls suggest that no combination of parties will win a stable majority—which could be the death knell for strong government (see article). May 7th could also mark the point of no return for the troubled union between England and Scotland, thanks to a surge in support for the secessionist Scottish National Party (SNP). The Tories have promised to renegotiate Britain’s relations with the EU and put the result to an in/out referendum on membership by the end of 2017. Meanwhile Ed Miliband, Labour’s leader, wants to remake British capitalism in pursuit of a fairer society. If he had his way, he would be the most economically radical premier since Margaret Thatcher.



If the stakes are high, the trade-offs are uncomfortable, at least for this newspaper. Our fealty is not to a political tribe, but to the liberal values that have guided us for 172 years. We believe in the radical centre: free markets, a limited state and an open, meritocratic society. These values led us to support Labour’s Tony Blair in 2001 and 2005. In 2010 we endorsed David Cameron, the Tory leader, seeing in him a willingness to tackle a yawning budget deficit and an ever-expanding state.



Five years on, the choice has become harder. The Tories’ Europhobia, which we regretted last time, could now do grave damage. A British exit from the EU would be a disaster, for both Britain and Europe. Labour and the Liberal Democrats are better on this score. But such is the suspicion many Britons feel towards Brussels that a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU is probably inevitable at some point. And we believe that the argument can be won on its merits.



The Lib Dems share our welcoming attitude towards immigrants and are keen to reform the voting system. But they can at most hope to be the junior partner in a coalition. The electorate, and this newspaper, therefore face a choice between a Conservative-dominated government and a Labour-dominated one. Despite the risk on Europe, the better choice is Mr Cameron’s Conservatives.



Our decision is based on the economy, where the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition has a stronger record than many realise and where Labour poses a greater risk. Admittedly, the macroeconomic signals are mixed. The budget deficit, at 5% of GDP, is still the second-highest in the G7. As Britons consume more than they produce, the current-account deficit is a worrying 5.5% of GDP. And although employment is high, living standards have suffered and productivity is weak. Adjusted for inflation, wages have fallen every year since 2009.



The Tories have made this squeeze on British living standards more painful, particularly for young people. They have protected pensioners from budget cuts and showered them with tax giveaways, forcing bigger sacrifices elsewhere. A failure to boost housing supply has led to soaring prices, also hitting the young. Some of the Tories’ election promises—to spare houses worth up to £1m ($1.5m) from inheritance tax and to sell social housing at a discount—are economically indefensible vote-buying gestures that will only add to the unfairness.



But three things count in the Tories’ favour. The coalition has cut the deficit more pragmatically than it admits and more progressively than its critics allow. When the economy weakened, the Tories eased the pace (although not by as much as this newspaper would have liked). Though the poorest Britons have been hit hard by spending cuts, the richest 10% have borne the greatest burden of extra taxes. Full-time workers earning the minimum wage pay a third as much income tax as in 2010. Overall, inequality has not widened—in contrast to America.



The record on public services is good. Government spending has fallen from 45.7% of GDP in 2010 to 40.7%, yet public satisfaction with the police and other services has gone up. Although almost 1m public-sector jobs have been cut, Britain has a higher share of people in work than ever before. From extra competition in education (with new free schools and academies) to the overhaul of the benefits system, public services are being revitalised. Some innovations have failed, including a rejigging of the National Health Service (NHS), but Britain’s reform of the state has been energetic and promising.



And lastly, in the short term, Britain’s weak productivity is the corollary of a jobs-rich, squeezed-wage recovery. Wage stagnation, as our briefing explains (see article), is not an exclusively British malaise. It is also preferable, both in economic efficiency and social equity, to the French or Italian disease of mass joblessness. Better to recover from a financial crash and deep recession with a flexible labour market in which wages adjust than through unemployment. Britain will be a model for Europe if the Tories can boost productivity—and they aim to do so by improving schools and infrastructure, giving power and money to cities and investing in science.



*Statism masquerading as progressivism*
Labour has a different way to tackle what it calls the “crisis” in living standards. In fiscal terms, its agenda belongs to the moderate centre-left. Mr Miliband also promises deficit reduction, and at a pace that makes more macroeconomic sense than the Tories’ plan—though his numbers are vaguer, and Labour’s record makes them harder to believe. He proposes a bit more redistribution: Labour plans tax increases for the wealthy, including raising the top rate of tax back to 50%, from 45%, and imposing a “mansion tax” on houses worth more than £2m. Individually, many of these proposals are reasonable. (The annual mansion tax on a £3m London house would be only £3,000, a fraction of the levy on New York property.) But, taken together, these plans risk chasing away the most enterprising, particularly the footloose global talent that London attracts.



Labour’s greater threat lies not in redistribution, but in meddling. Mr Miliband believes that living standards are squeezed because markets are rigged—and that the government can step in to fix them. He would freeze prices while “reviewing” energy markets, clamp down on the most flexible “zero-hour” labour contracts and limit rent rises. Along with this suspicion of private markets is an aversion to competition in the public sector, leading to proposals for, say, a cap on profit margins when private companies contract to provide services for the NHS.



Mr Miliband is fond of comparing his progressivism to that of Teddy Roosevelt, America’s trustbusting president. But the comparison is false. Rather than using the state to boost competition, Mr Miliband wants a heavier state hand in markets—which betrays an ill-founded faith in the ingenuity and wisdom of government. Even a brief, limited intervention can cast a lasting pall over investment and enterprise—witness the 75% income-tax rate of France’s president, François Hollande. The danger is all the greater because a Labour government looks fated to depend on the SNP, which leans strongly to the left.



On May 7th voters must weigh the certainty of economic damage under Labour against the possibility of a costly EU exit under the Tories. With Labour, the likely partnership with the SNP increases the risk. For the Tories, a coalition with the Lib Dems would reduce it. On that calculus, the best hope for Britain is with a continuation of a Conservative-led coalition.

Dave Cam did the same thing. He said he'll redue net migration. he could only change non-eu migration. The cons spouted a lot of rhetoric for their base, shutdown bogus schools BUT created some new special visa so the non-eu migrants don't get too effected.

null,false,haloraptor,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"The EU has benefits Europe-wide. One instance where Britain didn't benefit from this is in the tightening up of animal research regulations - because ours were already the most strict before the EU introduced the rules. But the rest of Europe had to make changes. So the EU did a good ethical thing but nobody in Britain cared.

Some things the EU does do benefit Britain. Wales is a major recipient of EU funding because it's been designated a 'convergence zone' requiring massive levels of help (other convergence zones include parts of Poland, Latvia, Lithuania...). The EU is paying for my postgraduate science degree.

The EU paid for my college's language facilities and its science labs, it helped fund the Cardiff Bay redevelopments...

The EU also helped to standardise standards and measures across Europe. It's helping to raise standards of living all across Europe. The EU is a vehicle for change at a continental level. Sometimes policies will directly benefit Britain and sometimes they won't. It's kind of a push and pull thing - there are some policies and programmes to our detriment, but then there are some policies and programmes to our benefit. 

British media suggests that we have no say in the EU and that everything is decided by Germany, but there are those in Europe who think the EU constantly makes compromises or just allows us to do whatever the fuck we want.

Someone from Surrey probably isn't going to care that the EU literally paid for my education, but the EU absolutely does benefit Britain. The problem is that the EU directs funds to where they're needed across the whole of the EU, so large parts of England wouldn't even be considered.

I think the main reason we haven't heard much about it in the media is because the narrative on the EU isn't about that in the moment. There's been some mentions from the nationalist parties (understandably, since these regions and the north of England in particular benefit more from the EU than England in general does) but few from anyone else, largely because the of the noise made by UKIP.

The EU doing something right or sensible is just boring, because that happens like all the time. But it's always with things that don't necessarily interest the average person. Because Britain on the whole is one of the wealthiest countries in the world and in Europe lots of policies the EU is really into won't benefit lots of Britain, but they do benefit the poorest areas.

You might then say, ""This could happen without the EU, the government just needs to allow Wales/Scotland/NI more funding for it"". I agree that could be the case. But it doesn't do that - funding for the Assembly and Scottish Parliament is based on levels of funding in England, so cuts made to English budgets affect the regional counterparts. And the point is that the government historically hasn't really invested in these areas. 

The EU also has a commitment to supporting minority languages and cultures, and that's pretty good for Wales and the Welsh language too.

It is perfectly obvious, to anyone with any intelligence (or a degree in PPE), that a market will always produce better outcomes than the state.  The fact that this particular market is (a) wholly funded by the state and (b) proving to be spectacularly inefficient, is clearly an indication that we are placing too many restrictions on free schools.

To see success in this market, we need further deregulation.  Free schools should be allowed to choose without restriction which pupils they take, what they teach, the standards and qualifications of the teachers, what they pay; they should also be removed of the burdens of maintaining safe premises, having their results monitored, or being subject to any kinds of checks or balances*.  

After all, the market will ensure that the most effective free schools thrive, and if the only cost to this is the loss of a few students' potential, then so be it.  We must stick to our principles.

I am extremely weary of the Labour/Conservative ""a vote for X is a vote for the red/blues"" narrative and feel the SNP are the only party who have a chance to write a new story.

If I was forced to vote in my term time address in England I would spoil my vote. I oppose FPTP as a sytem and feel the only way to demonstrate that opposition is to reject it entirely. I don't believe my single rejection will make any difference but it would be a more satisfying decision than casting any vote which encourages the system.

Note: My vote for SNP is a vote for a party who has demonstrated their excellent abilities as a governing party under a far more representative system. That can only encourage others throughout the UK to rethink FPTP. Especially when Labour begins to complain that SNP have ~55% of the popular vote in Scotland but are set to win ~100% of the seats. Will be pleasant to see how they react to being on the other side of things for the first time in decades.

EDIT: ""Through the back door"", ""In Bed with the"", ""This election is about whether you want the tories or the labour party in government"", ""X is in the pocket of X"", ""Long term economic plan"".

null,false,sometimesihelp,null,null,null,"Freecycle and other free sites are an awesome resource for people requiring their own furniture. There is also Gumtree and similar sites on which furniture sometimes pops up really cheap - just make sure to set yourself a budget. As /u/mr-strange says the hardest part is usually collecting the larger pieces which don't otherwise fit in your vehicle (e.g. sofas). Some of the pieces require a bit of work (for wooden items usually just a sand down and finish) but the money you can save vs buying new furniture certainly makes it worth while and the financial pain of moving easier. Then down the road when you start to buy/replace furniture the old stuff can be given away or sold.

Added: Whilst it is best to start looking and acquiring furniture before moving, since it can take a little while to collect all the relevant pieces, it is also worth noting that it is possible to move into a property without everything and continue to collect once moved. There are some basics you will 'need' to be able to move (e.g. bed, mattress, sofa) and there are others you can collect later if you willing to put up with it (e.g. chests of draws).

Definitely rent a bike. The infrastructure is there for it to be easy and safe.

Get a water bottle - there is basically a drinking water tap in every bathroom.

Use the market. I live at home so I don;t need this, but a lot of my mates say it's amazingly cheap for all kinds of things. One of my mates even gets his hair cut there.

The Union is expensive (IMO) and the city centre is a 10 minute walk away if you're a slow walker.

As far as specifics are concerned with what you're studying, I can help with Engineering.

edit 2: One that will apply to all courses at Leeds and doesn't get talked about - This Uni is prestigious in a lot of courses, and you'll find that your course mates are the fucking bees knees at a lot of stuff. It is absolutely normal to feel out of your depth, and feel like you don't belong here. There is a thing called ""imposter syndrome"" where even high achievers question their eligibility in high and coveted places. You are not alone, and help is available whether it be for your studies, finance or anything else. Student support are seriously good at Leeds.

You are completely contradicting yourself by blaming him when the team does poorly and not giving him praise for the team doing well. 



Yeah, he's not done great but he's done well given the horrible circumstances we were found to be in. The whole transfer debacle with not getting a quality striker followed by the worst thing that could possibly happen in Sturridge facing a long injury. Suddenly he's got to look to Balotelli or Borini to step up and neither was up to it. Lambert was bought as a backup so I'm not including him. I don't think there's a manager that could have done much better than Rodgers did in light of that. There are few managers that could have even gotten us close to top four and he did that in a shit situation.

Thomas Jones 
Sep 3 2011:  Copied, and slightly modified, from:
THE RIGHT WORD

 An ""enthusiast"" displays an intense and eager interest in something (: a sky-diving enthusiast).

 A ""fanatic"" is not only intense and eager but possibly irrational in his or her enthusiasm; fanatic suggests extreme devotion and a willingness to go to any length to maintain or carry out one's beliefs (: a fly-fishing fanatic who hired a helicopter to reach his favorite stream).

 A ""zealot"" exhibits not only extreme devotion but vehement activity in support of a cause or goal (: a feminist zealot who spent most of her time campaigning for women's rights).

 An ""extremist"" is a supporter of extreme doctrines or practices, particularly in a political context (: a paramilitary extremist who anticipated the overthrow of the government).

 But it is the ""bigot"" who causes the most trouble, exhibiting obstinate and often blind devotion to his or her beliefs and opinions. In contrast to fanatic and zealot, the term bigot implies intolerance and contempt for those who do not agree (: a bigot who could not accept his daughter's decision to marry outside her religion).

 --------------------

 So, I guess **if you are biased against bigots, you are not really a bigot, unless you are intolerant and contemptuous of those who are not also biased against bigots.**

The double training sessions that everyone praised on here for months as well could be a factor. Other coaches don't do double sessions because they provide a shorter term boost in fitness with a drop off further down the road.

FSG seem like they are being careful in giving the manager too much power after Dalglish, which I think is the wrong decision with Rodgers. If we can sign 2-3 quality players in the summer and stay away from the Europa then I think we will easily reach top 4.

The only way that happens though is if Rodgers gets more power and gets to make his signings, not more Balotelli's.

My thinking on signings would be the following. Signing a striker and right back/centre back. Move Can into midfield to take over for Gerrard and sign Milner . Get Wisdom on the bench for defence.

Rodgers did try his best with Balo, but he just doesn't know how to get the best out of him, and considering that neither could Mourinho or Mancini, that's not something to hammer him with either.

Now, I think Rodgers deserves at least till January unless Klopp wants the job(and I'd want him to sign a contract prior to sacking Brendan).

it is wise to keep rodgers from their perspective because he has 3 years remaining on his current contract and he has shown flashes of good managerial ability. almost winning the league last year, 2 semi finals this year...two years in a row where we went on double digit streaks without a loss. FSGs thinking here is that if you sack rodgers, you pay him upwards of 10m in a severance package and then have to pay someone like klopp a few million, who to be fair, didn't have a great season with a pretty talented dortmund squad (similar season to us). so im not so sure one way or the other that klopp would work for us, but what i do know is that FSG do not want to part ways with rodgers, and having 10m pounds in sunk costs without giving him one more year to show why we almost won the league in 2013-2014. 

It seems pretty counter intuitive to dump this project at this stage as well considering the investment made while rodgers has been in charge. largely a team of players who have developed under the Brendao philosophy, i think next year should be his make or break. if we're in 10th by christmas he gets the axe, if we finish 5th he gets the axe...we'll know at some point next season whether he is the guy because this is a huge challenge. lets buck the curve and give him one more year and hope for the start of something great.",null,0,null,1430406955,null,0,false,0,cqtwhav,null,t3_34eom3,null,t1_cqtwhav,null,t3_34eom3,null,null,null,1432693611,null,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8,null

The formula is always the same, they write a pretty good analysis of the facts - peppered with a few rhetorical sleighs-of-hand - before bringing us around to the forgone conclusion, that neoliberalism is the only, sensible option. In this case the conclusion is parachuted in, unsupported by the analysis that preceded it.

First the rhetorical sleigh-of-hand:
&gt; [Miliband] would be the most economically radical premier since Margaret Thatcher.

Technically true, but since Major, Blair, Brown and Cameron were the complete opposite of economically radical, this really isn't saying much is it.

&gt;We believe in the radical centre: free markets, a limited state and an open, meritocratic society.

Though, apparently radicalism is good, as long as it's the *right kind* of radicalism.

To summarise the economic meat of the article, which I pretty much agree with: A Brexit would be a disaster, Government's economic record is mixed, the budget deficit is still high, the current account deficit is high, unemployment is high, productivity is weak, real wages have fallen. Living standards have suffered, failure to build housing has hit the young, while pensioners have been protected and showered with give-aways. Tories' election tax promises are indefensible. So this is the bad side of the government's record; all hard facts, supported by figures, the Economist doing what it does well. But what's the good side?

Governments spending has dropped from 45% to 40% of GDP. Why should we care? Unless you're a ~~market fundamentalist~~ ""radical centrist"" this particular figure is purely academic. One million public sector jobs lost (hooray for unemployment), but the benefits system is ""being revitalised"". What on earth could they mean? The universal credit debacle? The fact that people are being denied benefits and treated like lepers by a system meant to serve them? We've left the world of facts and figures and are now in the realm of pure assertions that smack of being written by someone enjoying a healthy dose of privilege.

Now onto Labour, whose deficit plan ""makes more macroeconomic sense"" and whose proposals for non-doms, income tax and mansion tax are ""reasonable"". But,

&gt;taken together, these plans risk chasing away the most enterprising, particularly the footloose global talent that London attracts.

There's a lot to unpack here. Firstly, really? The threat that we've heard over and over again in recent years, that if you tax, regulate or even harshly criticise the corporations and/or the very rich that they will all run away to a desert island, like the plot of some Ayn Rand novel, and the rest of us peasants will be left wallowing in our own filth cursing ourselves for our own greed and stupidity, quite apart from sounding a bit like extortion, is probably a bluff. The vast majority of ""global talent that London attracts"" are nowhere near rich enough to be affected by the mansion tax or non-dom rules. A few might be affected by a 50% top rate (on income over £150,000), but if they really cared that much about taxation they would be in Dubai, or Hong Kong and not London. London has more to offer than just a tax haven for the very rich, people come here because it's London and they have to put up with ridiculously expensive housing and wonky transport, but they think it's worth it. To believe that a marginal increase in the marginal rate of tax of the already very well off will be a deterrent is a bit delusional. Finally, and most importantly this sentence implies that people should decide *on how to vote in a national election* based on how attractive London might be to a small number of wealthy expats. Breathtakingly parochial.

Miliband might also ""meddle"" in markets widely regarded as broken, and this is apparently the ""greatest threat"", and he opposes an NHS reform that three paragraphs earlier was described as ""failed"".

The Economist then concludes that in this ""high-stakes"" election the risk of the ""disaster"" of a British exit from the EU is outweighed by their weak and lack-lustre criticism of Labour.

The basic income one may seem unaffordable but the idea is that tax rates are also adjusted so that it has no net impact on anyone earning more than a certain amount (10k?). Most people earning less than 10k already get some type of benefit and the idea is that a basic income will simply reduce a lot of the overhead for people claiming job seekers, tax credit, etc. They will no longer have to claim if their benefit payment is under the basic income.

Coming back to wealth taxation, did you know that the total wealth in the UK has gone UP by over £1tr between 2006-8 and 2010-2. So while we've been 'broke' and been in austerity total wealth has gone up by over 10%. Since 2012 is has probably kept going up.

The UK has only ever built enough housing when the public sector built around half of them, this was before 1980. Since then the public sector stopped but the private sector has not increased at all!! The greens are the only party committing to build public sector housing (~100k a year).

null,false,themedes,cnty-england,Cambridge,null,"""Mr Miliband is preoccupied with inequality. His prescription is an increase in taxes such as restoring the 50p level for high earners and imposing an ill-conceived mansion tax.

Mr Miliband has too often found himself on the wrong side of the argument. He promised to freeze energy prices shortly before world prices collapsed. An already heavily regulated banking sector and private landlords are now in his sights. He has stepped too far away from the New Labour position that markets can be harnessed to progressive outcomes. At times, he appears to be fighting his campaign in the style of France’s François Hollande in 2012. True, Mr Hollande secured victory but at the price of a weak economy and an exodus of talent, often to London.

At this delicate moment, the best outcome would be a continuation of the 2010 coalition between the Conservatives and Lib Dems… The country would benefit from the countervailing force of Lib Dem moderation at Westminster. In seats where the Lib Dems are the incumbent or the main challenger, we would vote tactically for them.

Ultimately, however, there is only one leader and one party that can head the government. There are risks in re-electing Mr Cameron’s party, especially on Europe. But there are greater risks in not doing so. Its instincts on the economy, business and reform of public services are broadly right. Mr Miliband has not offered a credible economic prospectus and would apply a brake on enterprise. In the circumstances, the FT would like to see a Conservative-led administration.”

False equivalence

&gt;Low productivity is a global phenomenon and multi faceted. It's far too complex to say that's only the Tories fault. That's worse than blaming the crisis entirely on labour.

But it's 25% worse in the Uk than other G7 countries. I didn't say it was the Tory's fault but a possible consequence of the structure of our labour market.

&gt;Germany has rent controls? I think you mean they have much stronger renters rights.

Rent increases are also regulated by local government.

&gt;We need to provide as much incentive for people to build as possible. Not reduce them.

Considering the low construction rate, lack of rent control hasn't been that great an incentive . It also too means too much  domestic income is spent on rents, The real problem lies is in  the supply chain - we need to disincentivise land sitting, relax regulation and re-invest in social housing.

Sunderland might get something at home to Southampton (probably a point). It's usually an incredibly dull fixture and Saints are without Schnidelan til the end of the season. Can't see them getting anything from Arsenal, Chelsea and probably Everton. Either a point or noting against Leicester leaving them with 31/32.



Hull will either draw or beat Burnley. I could see them getting a point at Spurs with how Spurs are playing atm, a lot of ex Spurs players hoping to put in a good performance. Utd and Arsenal will beat them leaving them with 36/38


QPR get a point at Liverpool depending on the atmosphere at Anfield. Liverpool are making a meal of breaking teams down, so if QPR score early they could well win. Probably losing against Leicester and City. They will certainly beat Newcastle if nothing changes at that club leaving QPR with 31



Burnley probably pick up 3/4 points in the run in, maybe a draw against West Ham and maybe a win against Stoke (who they beat away at the start of the season). Burnley on 30

sitting on the step

the strawberries glistening
in the hot sunlight
we dipped them in sugar
looking at each other
not hurrying the feast
for one to come
the empty plates
laid on the stone together
with the two forks crossed
and I bent towards you
sweet in that air
in my arms
abandoned like a child
from your eager mouth
the taste of strawberries

lean back again
let me love you

the heat intense

The main difference between liberalism and libertarianism is that the former (modern liberalism, not classical liberalism) is generally giving over your rights and freedoms as a citizen to a representative or government and allowing them to sort every thing out for you. It's not a participatory democracy, you vote and then you hope the weirdo motherfucker you voted for who for some creepy reason *wants* to govern you does what he says he'll do.

Because they and not you guarantee you won't be offended by something and have in my view started to stagnate and innoculate any real individuality - especially in a political sense. And so long as you get a job, you can pay taxes to them, so they can earn more than most of us (including civil servants et al) so their kids are well looked after and get rich. And they like to spend money in ways you didn't sign off on. And then their kids probably get into politics too, because you know its a family business. 

Libertarianism - is more about reducing the amount of a hold a government has on its citizens and reducing it to the bare minimum for the most efficient function for the lowest cost to a citizens freedoms. And the great thing about that is that people are generally left to their own devices and not harranged by many nonsensical rules. 

Just one anecdotal example. I applied for a job at NICVA recently. Their equality form said candidates would be considered **irrespective** of your religion, race, sexual preference, gender etc.

Then you have to fill a form out telling someone in that organisation each and every one of those things so they can balance the numbers because they're being ""equal"". Makes fuck all sense to me but it fills another desk in the Equality Commission.

Also oil is back on the rise and it was explicitly clear that it was never the driving force behind the economic plan, just a bonus.

I voted Yes, so don't ask me why 'we' voted  No. Presumably because 'your' politicians, media and celebrities begged Scotland to stay and lied to fearful and undecided voters.

Schmidt:  48 years old, 10 years of 1st team management.  Currently at Leverkusen.  2 trophies from his time at Red Bull Salzburg.

Yakin:  40 years old, 8 years of 1st team management.  Currently at Spartak Moscow.  4 trophies from his time at Basel.

Emery:  43 years old, 8 years of 1st team management.  Currently at Sevilla.  1 trophy from Sevilla.

Favre:  57 years old, 24 years of 1st team management.  Currently at Monchengladbach.  4 trophies from his time at Servette FC and Zurich FC.

Fournier:  47 years old, 7 years of 1st team management.  Currently at Lyon.  

I don't know that any of these are 'big names' nor do I know if any of them are necessarily available (some just moved last summer, like Fournier and Favre) but what they all have is at least as much experience managing a 1st team as Rodgers does now and well more than he did when we hired him.

If there wasn't massive underutilisation of council house stock then we wouldn't need this policy? Because it would be pointless? Because nobody would be charged anything? 

Facts:

* There are massive waiting lists for bigger council houses/flats for families.
* There are lots of people - couples who've got kids moved out, etc - living in 3-4 bed council houses with 1 or 2 spare rooms.

Now I do think some changes should be made - e.g you shouldn't have to pay if you literally can't move (and I believe there are already some exemptions along these lines). Other than that I think it's a good policy and it'll help a lot of families currently in social housing. We need more council houses, but we need to use what we've got right because building new council homes costs money.

&gt;THE murder of James Foley, an American journalist kidnapped by jihadists in Syria, was always likely to fill newspapers. His killer’s British accent has started a storm (see Bagehot). Since the news broke, David Cameron, the prime minister, has argued for “a tough security response”. Theresa May, the home secretary, added that “we must do all that we can to stop radicalisation”, and hinted at new laws. Boris Johnson, London’s mayor and a would-be MP, called for a “swift and minor” change to the law, to the effect that anybody who travels to a war zone without informing the authorities can be presumed to have gone for terrorist purposes.

&gt;Such musings worried lawyers and civil-liberties campaigners, who are accustomed to governments reacting to enormities with draconian new laws. But if the recent past is any guide, they can rest easy. Through a peculiar combination of high principle and low muddle, and almost despite itself, the government has adopted a surprisingly liberal position in the balance between security and liberty.

&gt;Shortly after coming to power in 2010, the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition made several changes to the counter-terrorism regime set up under Tony Blair’s leadership. Control orders, which had severely curtailed the lives of people suspected of terrorism but not convicted of a crime, were abolished and replaced with “Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures”, or TPIMs, which are less restrictive. Counter-terrorism stops and searches by police, of which there were 150,000 in 2009, were abolished. The time for which terrorism suspects can be held by police without being charged—which the previous government tried, unsuccessfully, to increase from 28 days to 90 days—has instead been cut back to just 14.

&gt;Ministers now talk soberly about the urgent task of tackling Islamic radicalism in Britain, and not just the violent sort. But this amounts to little in practice, because Whitehall is not in charge of the matter. In 2011 the Prevent Strategy, in which the previous government invested money and expertise to prevent radicalisation, was financially gutted and its work mostly handed to local authorities.

&gt;A task force set up after the murder of Lee Rigby, a soldier, by two fanatical Muslims last year has largely been a talking shop for senior politicians, says Martin Innes, an expert at Cardiff University. Mrs May’s plan to make it easier for the security services to snoop on internet use was blocked by the Liberal Democrats. They also snipped away at new powers to strip naturalised Britons of their citizenship.

&gt;Meanwhile none of the ten TPIMs introduced so far is still in operation. Seven expired and three were breached: two by people who absconded and whose whereabouts are still unknown. One, Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, apparently slipped off his ankle tag before leaving a West London mosque disguised in a burqa. In May, a court quashed his TPIM on the basis that its original imposition (as a control order) relied on secret evidence.

&gt;John McTernan, a former adviser to Tony Blair, reckons the coalition has “betrayed national security” with its liberalism. Some Conservatives feel this too. David Davis, an MP who in 2008 resigned his seat in protest at Labour impositions on civil liberties, now wants people who go to fight in Syria to be deprived of their citizenship, even if it makes them stateless.

&gt;Yet a more optimistic view is that a coalition that promised to be less authoritarian than Labour seems to have kept its word. Britain is a more liberal and principled country as a result. The difficulty now will be proving that it is a safer place, too.

We are 1 point off finishing 7th and how we're playing I would not be surprised to end up there. Again this isn't even the biggest issue, I could really handle finishing 7th if we were just unlucky and had showed we can play good football and were just beaten by better teams but can you honestly say we have played good football this season? I can count on 1 hand how many games we have really gone out and played good football and won by a few goals and a team of our calibre after spending this much money should be playing better. 

Another glaring issue is what is our playstyle? I can justify giving someone time to build towards something but what are we building towards under Rodgers? We haven't really shown we have a style we are building on and can people honestly say that Rodgers has used this team to it's potential? We're playing players out of position and not playing nice football while the players seem unmotivated and I cannot see 1 reason why it would suddenly change over summer. We had 1 good run of results, don't forget before Xmas we were below Everton and we could very well be in a similar position if it wasn't for a couple of months of good results before again seeming completely lost. 

I appreciate all Rodgers has done for us but I think we can see him for what he is now, a young manager who is just out of ideas.

It'll allow nations to more easily buy and sell energy between countries.

Nathan thinks he's infallible and also has a desire to be so he literally became that.

Jess has a desire to ""see through"" other people's bullshit so now she can literally see through them. 

Finn is kind of wimpy so I think his desire to be strong and/or impressive inspired his powers of telepathy, but obviously a lack of confidence never allows him to fully live up to that.

Curtis' ability to turn back time comes from his desire to want to have a second chance to change the past or do things differently. His incessant "" I shouldn't even be here"" shows that. 

Kelly worries about what other people think about her and is self-conscious so that inspires her power to read minds. 

Alisha is someone who wants others to want her, love her, need/desire her so her power makes that happen in a very literal sense. 

Rudy is the product of a split personality - he even says it himself in an episode and the physical manifestation of the id, super id, and ego are all represented by the 3 Rudys.

Ha ha ha ha. Scared of an argument so resorts to that.

The solution to the housing shortage is to build more council houses while making sure we're utilising what we've got correctly. One way to do this is to charge people who are currently occupying council houses larger than what they need.

I agree that moving people away from their support networks isn't a great side effect, and I'd like to see more done to make sure people aren't moved too far/ aren't charged if there's nowhere to move. I think I'll write to my local MP about it.

 At the end of the day though council homes are not private property... they're there to help the people who need them most. And this policy will help people like my mate.

*Build more social houses but don't simultaneously tax people who have a spare bedroom because a) the two ideas aren't actually interdependent and b) having a spare bedroom in your house doesn't automatically mean you should move to a smaller one, and while it might be the case that you could it would be expensive to start testing this fairly so it's better just not to go there and treat the actual problem instead of penalizing people

*Stop subsidising private landlords freely with housing benefit and stop artificially inflating house prices with help-to-buy and right-to-buy schemes etc (cynical vote-buying giveaways that fuck up our national housing market)

*Investigate careful deregulation to make housebuilding cheaper and easier

&gt;If no one participates, there is no voting system. Therefore the credibility of any given voting system scales in relation to the level of participation. If the level of participation is high, it lends the voting system credibility, but if it's low, it hurts the voting systems credibility. It's far easier to argue FPTP should be scrapped if it has a 35% turnout than if it has a 90% turnout.

&gt;It's essentially the same idea as voting with your wallet, but with votes. I think most of us recognize that companies are far less receptive to customer complaints until it starts to affect their bottom line. If you threaten to cancel your service, subscription or whatever, most companies will suddenly go ""woah, hang on now, lets not be hasty. Maybe something could be worked out"". Similarly, political parties will keep on keeping on until they start to lose votes. This is the very argument used to justify voting for smaller parties or spoiling your ballot. If they stop getting your votes, they want to win them back and adjust accordingly.

&gt;You can apply the same thing to the voting system. If you continue to plug votes in, it has very little reason to change. You're doing what it requires to succeed. As such, it is nigh-impossible to vote in a way that will harm first past the post more than it will help it, because merely participating helps prop it up more than it contributes to tearing it down. There is one exception which is specific to FPTP however and that's hung parliaments. If you're in a contested seat and you can help someone win that makes a hung parliament more likely, you should absolutely do so (according to current polls, reducing tory seats seems to be desirable to that end). This is because FPTP aims to avoid hung parliaments and thus they damage its credibility along with low turnout.

And this year our record in big games isn't exactly one to brag about, just because we 'beat Southampton twice, City, Spurs twice' we also lost to United twice, Drew and lost to Arsenal, lost to Chelsea and lost to City'. We beat Spurs/Soton and they were important but the teams above us have pretty much all beaten us except for 1 win off City.

Also as much as you can argue other people have an agenda you are clearly spinning facts to suit your picture too. You're making it seem like Rodgers has a good record in big games while trying to discredit Klopps achievements. Lets look at his record against the bigger teams in the league. 

  

**2012-13**

Arsenal - LD, Spurs - LW, City - DD, Utd - LL, Chels - DD, Everton - DD

I mean, it's pretty underwhelming isn't it? a win against Spurs, a bunch of draws and 4 losses including 2 against United. We also did terrible in the cups being knocked out 2 games in to both the FA and League cup to Swansea and Oldham. In Europe we got through a fairly decent group but then immediately lost to Zenit. Honestly looking at this you'd have to say every big game was pretty much bottled.

  

**2013-14**

Arsenal - LW, Spurs - WW, City - LW, Utd - WW, Chels - LL, Everton - WW

Better league results obviously but lost early on in both domestic cups against Utd and Arsenal. I'll give him credit we got results in some big league games but we also lost in both cups as soon as we faced anyone decent. I mean overall it's good but when push came to shove in the biggest game where it was all on the line we lost. Obviously a step up from his 1st season though.

 

**2014-15**

Arsenal - LD, Spurs - WW, City - WL, Utd - LL, Chels - L?, Everton - DD

A pretty big regression back towards his first season. The biggest two games there being Utd and Arsenal when wins would have cemented us in top 4 both resulted in losses, the latter being a hammering.
Despite progressing in cups ties were favourable only facing 2 premier league teams in both cups up until the semi's and we still relied on penalties, late goals and replays in both along the way. A decent showing against Chelsea resulted in a loss and a very poor showing against Villa ended this seasons cup hopes. In Europe we fared no better being unceremoniously dumped out the CL in the group stages before being beaten by Besiktas at the first hurdle in the Europa. 

  


I've tried to be pretty fair in that assessment and honestly I struggle to see how you can look at all those and say he has a good record in big games. When push comes to shove he has a handful of victories and has consistently performed fairly poor in cup matches and Europe. One season of better results in the league doesn't outweigh 2 4 wins from 23 of the games you'd typically look out for when fixtures are released along with 9 losses. I really struggle to see how anyone could say he does well in big games though. A couple of exceptions doesn't outweigh consistent disappointments in cups and Europe and pretty poor results V teams around us in the league imo.",null,0,null,1430412377,null,0,1430414675,0,cqtzz36,null,t3_34a42p,null,t1_cqtzz36,null,t1_cqtb5fu,null,null,null,1432695328,null,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

Prefer Conservative economic policy, but dislike them on welfare and loath their plans for housing. 

Should therefore be a Lib Dem, but dislike their policies on defence,  nuclear and pensions (why the hell do the elderly get special treatment compared to the rest of the population - it strikes me as shameless porkbarrelling of the grey vote - also losing the contracting out of Second State Pension means I'm going to get hit by an increase in NI next year). They are probably the closest to what I believe in atm though.

Not voting Green in a month of Thursdays. I believe their heart is in the right place, but I honestly think they'd piledrive the economy into the ground, and no matter what you say about the national debt not being like domestic finances, the simple fact is that a collapsing economy + and unbalanced deficit at the very least will put up borrowing costs. Every pound going into servicing the national debt is a pound not going into things like the NHS.

Which leaves Labour. Two years ago it would have been unthinkable that I'd vote for them (I voted Tory last time) but Ed Miliband is slowly growing on me. That said, I don't really see their policies helping me. Take for example the 3 year no rent rises thing on tenancies - I've never stayed in the same place for more than a year, and I don't see that getting any longer than 24 months in the next 5 years. I'm also concerned (rightly or wrongly) about the SNP tail wagging the Labour dog. That said, an extra seat for Labour can only strengthen their position.

As you are said our voting system is shitty, and a few months ago a lot of people I knew were talking about government reform, but as the day draws closer everyone falls into the same traps of tactical voting or just voting for the party they sympathise with the most. To me this is damaging, it looks like we're heading for a hung parliament again, and for everyone on this thread saying they are going to vote Lib Dem it scares me because if it comes to it aren't the Tories and the Lib Dems going to try to retain this coalition... I just couldn't take that. It seems like now the only option the voter has is to imagine their ideal coalition force I think mine would be Labour/Lib dem/Greens, as Ed has impressed me recently but I don't think Labour go quite far enough with some of their policies. But the problem herein is that we have no idea if our vote is going to stand for what we want it to. Last election I voted for Lib Dem and ended up with a Right Wing Tory government that has been absolutely disastrous, at least for me. How can I vote for any of these parties with no faith in the system. My Grandmother once said to me she would only ever vote for labour, she'd like to vote lib dem, but 'It would be a waste of a vote'. THis is the system we have, In what way is that democratic? I'm seriously considering defacing the ballot paper, as they are still counted, as a protest vote to try and call for electoral reform, now... I don't want this to go on for another 10-15 years before we finally put a new system in place. The only problem is a lot of people would need to get behind this idea for it to be worth it in any way... and I have a feeling most people will just slip back into voting normally, and will be very disillusioned come May 7th.

They are interdependent though, that's what you're missing. There's a stock, X of council homes, and there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5+ family sizes that need to fit into them. We don't have infinite money to build council homes as a country, so what we need is to find the most cost-effective way to fit all of these people into the homes.

You can't just build more and more homes of all sizes, because guess what - in 5 years, some of the 2 person couples will have had 2 kids. Then you've got a problem - how do they move up to a bigger home with a second, or second and third bedroom?

Then you need to make sure they can move up the chain, whilst someone who's kids have left home can move down it. Managing the stock properly like this is the solution ALONGSIDE building more council homes.

You can't have one without the other because building homes is bloody expensive.

So what's the solution - you either a. force people to move, which is worse! or b. say okay, you can stay, but because you're not properly utilising the space you have you can pay a bit extra. That's the policy I support, with some caveats that I think it could be executed better (but I don't really think any other parties have a better policy on this front except 'scrap it' which isn't a solution.)

&gt;Stop subsidising private landlords with housing benefit and stop artificially inflating house prices with help-to-buy and right-to-buy schemes etc (cynical vote-buying giveaways)

Help-to-buy is kind of a completely different issue (interrelated but there's reasons why help to buy is good... it's as much of a reaction to house prices as it is a boost to them) but right-to-buy is a good policy AS LONG AS we're reinvesting the right-to-by cash into housing stock. I don't think any party has this bit right.

To fully repay the £27,000 in tuition fees, over thirty years, would require you maintain an average income of £31,000 for thirty years. Across all age bands, that's around the top 25% of earners. When you consider earning capacity starts low and increases over the decades, you need to maintain a much stronger salary to fully repay the loans (the median income for 25-29 year olds is £19,300).

If you were to break it down into pentiles, the top 20% of earners will fully repay their university loans (tuition and maintenance). The 2nd 1/5th would repay roughly 40% of their loans*. The 3rd 1/5th 0% (as that group earn roughly the 50th percentile of income; £21,000). The 4th and 5th will pay nothing, too.

*The 2nd 1/5th, paying back 40% of their overall loans is £17,000, which is about £6,000 less than they would have paid under the 2004 Fees schedule.

So in summary, the top 20% of earners pay back the new full amount. The next 1/5th pay back less than the old schedule (!). And the least well-off 60% of earners pay back not a single penny.

null,false,Furthur_slimeking,lfc99,,null,"&gt; whereas signing Klopp will indicate a significant short-term investment. You don't bring in a manager with a large recruiting pull if you aren't going to back him financially to capitalize on that advantage.

  I don't know about this. People seem to forget the state Dortmund were in when Klopp arrived. They had just finished 13th in the Bundesliga. Experienced players were leaving and Klopp built a side which, two years later, won the league. He did what Rodgers is trying to do. He won the league a second time and reached the CL final. 

  Now, there is no guarantee that Klopp would do a better job than Rodgers, but his track record at achieving success with limited resources is solid. Rodgers has no track record of winning anything. All things being equal, the likelihood is that Klopp *would* be more successful than Rodgers. But there is no guarantee.

  Rodgers has not done a bad job. On the contrary, he's done very well and the club is in a much better position than we were when he started. A lot of this is down to FSG, though. Rodgers has not done well in the transfer market. He has overpaid for his personal targets and doesn't seem to be able to work with the transfer committee. The reason the transfer committee exists is largely because FSG don't trust Rodgers with their money due to his inexperience in the market. Klopp has made numerous extremely successful signings. He knows the market and can spot talent, and his success in the past as well as his personality make him attractive to work with. 

  So I don't think Klopp would be a short term investment. Rodgers has taken us this far, but it's not certain (I would say unlikely) that he can take us further with the resources we have. Singing Klopp would not be a drive for instant success, but to get us back into the Champions League on a regular basis, to get us competing with the best in Europe again, and to have is in a title challenge every year. That's where we need to be, and Klopp is more capable of putting us there than Brendan.

They state things are good or bad but usually don't want to give a lesson on it, i suppose it might be weird if in the middle of a debate we get some economics or politics lesson and some people may find it quite condescending.

I also think there is a massive amount of people with this problem, during my business studies class while we were doing the EU topic and a substitute teacher over heard us talking about it through the corridor and came in to ask about why we should stay in, he sounded like a big UKIP supporter at first and left a Labour supporter after things were explained.

It is a problem though and I'm honestly surprised there isn't a website or even a BBC webpage that is designed to educate people on the big topics during the election. 

**Anyway to get to the point.** Being in the EU allows free movement of goods/services/labour/capital. It's good because it allows us to compete in the European market effectively as by law we can avoid any trade barriers to the EU, which is where 50% of our exports go. This means our imports and exports can avoid tariffs and quotas etc. Imagine if we sold to the EU without being part of the EU and they could impose trade barriers onto us, a tax on our imports to their country so increasing the costs of a UK business. This in turn would mean they would need to increase their prices to compensate. Now would you pay 30 Euros or 25 Euros for the same/similar product. The UK product is now 30 compared to the product that came from the EU without any trade barriers. Therefore exiting the EU is believed to damage the UK economy because our exports would be significantly damaged as the sales of our goods would be hit pretty hard.

Also, of course there is more to the topic but this is the basic advantage.",null,0,null,1430413440,null,0,false,0,cqu0o28,null,t3_34edl1,null,t1_cqu0o28,null,t3_34edl1,null,null,null,1432695655,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

While defending the party from charges of racism (""I could not find any racism in UKIP’s policies. I did find racism spoken by prior members, but continuing accusations of racism seem to be overplayed by political opponents.""), the author criticizes UKIP in many areas. For example:

&gt;While promising more fiscal responsibility, UKIP has joined the irresponsible competition between all the other parties about how much more they would invest in health care and social care. All the parties promise to invest more — they just dispute how much.

I support the broad direction but I'd like to see the implementation changed in a couple of ways. 

&gt; If we need to save in the good times and spend in the bad why do you support a party wanting to cut now, while we are still in the bad times?

Because cutting things to reduce expenditure whilst spending on things which increase investment is the approach that's worked very well for us. I think our public spending was too high = we found ourselves fucked when it came to an recession. Our credit rating was in real difficulty and if we hadn't rebalanced majorly, we could have found our borrowing became crazily expensive (ratings agencies praised our cutting so kept our rating high). 

We need to rebuild our way to a surplus and reduce our overall debt burden in these times of decent growth. When the next **inevitable** recession comes around, we can spend on big infrastructure projects to stimulate the economy and raise our debt burden a little to a manageable level which you can then bring back under control later.

Prisoners will be given the vote.

&gt;Are you nuts?

Putting people in prison costs money. You (the taxpayer) are paying for room and board for all these people who... downloaded bootleg DVDs, smoked a joint or two, got their tits out on a bus...

Saving prison for people who really should not be allowed to roam the streets makes more sense than using it as a holiday camp for the mildly rebellious. Nuts as it may be, it's cheaper, easier, wastes less time for police and judges (feeds into 'cheaper' as well), and redresses the balance between a truly dangerous person and a docile, drugged up thief.

&gt;Taxes would be higher, much higher, and international aid would be increased by 50 per cent.

&gt;Yes, with all this money being thrown around, do you people have any idea where they're going to get it from? US!!! Tax payers! (maybe not people ITT claiming they're going to vote for greens, because they're either students studying some poxy degree like Sociology or women's studies or they're fucking delusional, living in a little hug box unaware of how the Country is run).

This answers a few of your other points, hence why I didn't include them. However, you seem outraged that the government is funded by tax. Did you really think the Tories get all their money from selling sunshine and rainbows to little blue pixies from Mars? No, they too get their money from tax. All the money we're wasting on overstuffing our prisons with everyone from mass murderers to TV license evaders comes from tax. All the money we're wasting on weapons we have a continuing promise to never, ever use comes from tax. All the money we're handing over to private corporations to do jobs that the country relies on, for profit, comes from tax. 

About that... Nationalised things are necessarily cheaper than privately-run things, because it's the same service at the same cost, but one's doing it for profit and the other is not. Also, the government uses HUGE contracts with suppliers. Suppliers stand to make big money from any government contract, so if they can supply the cheapest one, even at astonishingly low prices, they will. Private companies don't have that level of negotiating power, because they don't have the whole country as their customer base. The bigger the customer base, the more lucrative the supply contract is for the supplier.

When the government makes a profit, it's a lucky scenario that means tax goes down. When a private company, paid by the government, makes a profit, they like that and want more. Tax goes up.

&gt;It will be a criminal offence, with “significant fines”, to stop a woman from breastfeeding in a restaurant or shop, and formula milk will be more tightly regulated.

&gt;Why not let the owners of the business decide, it's their choice.

It's their choice how they conduct their own business. It's not their choice how to parent a child. Breastfeeding isn't a matter of protecting a business, it's a matter of childcare. This is a little similar, however with important differences, to the smoking ban from 2007. Where smoking is a personal act, it has been banned from all public buildings, regardless of whether the owner agrees or not. However, unlike breastfeeding, smoking causes harm to people, both the smoker and others. Breastfeeding has nothing but health benefits, however they are limited to the mother and child. Nobody else is affected. Your angle was that of the business owner, though, in which case it is pretty much analogous to the smoking ban. A law regarding a personal behaviour which directly impacts the business owners ability to kick out customers. However, while nobody but the mother and child are in any way affected by breastfeeding, there's no cause to complain about the activity, since it's unlikely to drive asthmatics and people averse to smoky smells away, therefore unlikely to result in an impact on business (which is another important difference from the smoking ban, which effectively banished smokers from pubs, having a catastrophic effect on pub custom).

&gt; Merely being a member of al-Qaeda, the IRA and other currently proscribed terrorist groups will no longer be a criminal offence under Green plans, and instead a Green Government should seek to “address desperate motivations that lie behind many atrocities labelled ‘terrorist’,” the policy book states.

&gt;Yea, because hugging them will work! We're already a bastion for terrorism, with many of them home grown...let's just make it worse shall we?

Hugging them? Who said anything about hugging them? If my brain is to be believed, being a member of a group is not a criminal offence. Got the card, didn't kill anyone. Got the lanyard, didn't build any bombs. Got the 'I heart Bin Laden' limited edition rhinestone-studded t-shirt, never seen the inside of a plane cockpit.... Again it comes down to the prisons question. Do we really want to be locking people up, at taxpayers' expense, for being anything other than actually dangerous? Taking the 'they're a member of ISIS, which means one day they might bomb us all' approach is very much similar to 'they're a member of MENSA. They have the intelligence to build an advanced AI that will kill the whole planet, and call it Ultron'.

While personally I'd rather call a planet-killing AI 'Twinkles', the point is that people shouldn't be arrested and imprisoned for crimes committed by people they probably haven't met. Obviously they agree with those crimes having been committed, but the point is they most likely weren't involved, so really, it's tantamount to locking them away for thinking differently. A thought crime.

THIS. I don't think any of the young players has failed yet. They were all bought for the long term (except Manquillo) so not being a disaster in their first year is enough.

Women are paid less in this country ON AVERAGE, she said it clearly. The questions is not about women getting paid less, its a question about women statistically working less. The sad thing is they never bring things like that up unless pushed. 

I have a real issue with the whole 'women are the ones who are not equal in this country' argument as it stands, just because 'women' are a huge diverse group full of very rich and very poor people who come from thousands of different backgrounds. If you forget about the whole the majority of people in prison are male, the majority of homeless people are male, the majority of people who commit suicide are male, the majority of people doing well at school and going to university are male, then maybe I would agree that women are 'less equal'. But it feels to me that this party wouldn't admit those things unless pushed because they want to garner the popular vote. 

Imagine if there was a party called the 'men's equality party' who quoted the figures I've just said. There would be outrage at the mysogny of it.

Which is why it is important to try and stop it getting into the country. Yes, this £500 million may only be a small drop in the ocean, but that is still £500 million less getting into the hands of criminals.

For the record, I do agree with you that prohibition is not working and that legislation would help. These options are not magic bullets though, you would still need to try and intercept illegal shipments before they got to the UK.

null,false,theartofrolling,null,null,null,"&gt;Surely this means we need more efficient methods of intercepting shipments instead of not trying at all. If we just stopped trying, then a lot more could be brought into the country.

But where do we draw the line? No matter how much we try, no matter how much we spend, no matter how we decide to punish users, the demand for these drugs will exist and people will take them.

&gt;Which is why it is important to try and stop it getting into the country. Yes, this £500 million may only be a small drop in the ocean, but that is still £500 million less getting into the hands of criminals.

I'm not suggesting that legalisation would solve the drug problem over night, because nothing ever will, and to expect to be able to stop people using drugs is naive and (as we have seen countless times) dangerous and discriminates against the poor and minorities.

All I was saying with my original comment is that this tactic of seizing ships is a farce and a waste of money, which would be better spent on educating people about drugs and treating addicts.

All these busts do is provide a photo-op for the police force; it's not just a drop in the bucket, it's a drop in the ocean.

&gt;However, should we really have a regulated industry for recreational use of hard drugs?

In a word, yes. It makes much more sense to stop prosecuting users and wasting money, and instead provide a safe, clean product and encourage users to stop/seek help if they need it.

Look at tobacco; it's actually more addictive and harmful than cocaine, but we've managed to *drastically* cut down on use without resorting to prohibition; with nothing more than a few sensible policies and education.

A failure to boost housing supply has led to soaring prices, also hitting the young.

I posted this last week and it got removed by the automod. I messaged the mods but they didn't respond:

I’ve followed with some interest the posts about the “Outdoor Cinema” events run by the company that sprung up over Facebook in the last week or so. These events seemingly popped out of nowhere, and quickly garnered a huge following, with nearly 100,000 people liking the Facebook page. A criticism was published by Mark Cook particularly a criticism on his blog, after being unable to find any evidence of the company putting the event on existing. This was retracted after the company provided some evidence, and were given the right of reply. They categorically denied that the company was not linked to some of the other events that had been published at roughly the same time, such as “Wipeout UK”, the similarly named “The Open Air Cinema” and “Radio 1 Big Weekend 2016″ pages.

While this company seems legitimate, “The Open Air Cinema” seems a little more suspicious. An [online article by Gloucestershire Post](http://www.gloucestershireecho.co.uk/Organiser-Open-Air-Cinema-Cheltenham-hopes/story-26325405-detail/story.html) suggested that an organiser behind these is named Christian Samuels, who works for an event organising company in Cardiff. It was quite easy to track down this person on Facebook and LinkedIn, and the company that is behind these events is called[ Electric Ents.](https://www.facebook.com/Electricents?fref=ts)

The website for “The Open Air Cinema,” linked to from the facebook page which was launched on the 11th April, is registered to “Volt Marketing Ltd,” and was registered on the 14th April. Both The Outdoor Cinema Facebook page  and website were registered on the 12th April, which seems consistent with them seeing a competitor page launching prior to their launch.

The Companies House registration for Volt Marketing, who seem to be behind the Electric Ents page names a Daniel Jeffreys as the sole director of the company. The registered business address is in Cardiff. Additionally, the domain www.electricents.co.uk is registered to Daniel Jeffreys. I cannot find a company registration for a company named Electric Ents. Christian Samuels refers to himself on LinkedIn as the Marketing Director of Volt Marketing up until January of this year. He also lists himself as the director of Future Residential Ltd, which has the same registered address as Volt Marketing.

Between Christian Samuels/James and Daniel Jeffreys, there seem to be a number of things which are interesting. Electric Ents at present put on events such as club nights in Cardiff and Bath, but outside of that their presence seems small as far as events that have gone ahead.

We’ve been able to link quite a few events and pages on Facebook back to this Electric Ents company over the last couple of years:

* [An Exeter Safer Sex Ball](http://exeter.tab.co.uk/2014/04/23/is-the-safe-sex-ball-back-mysterious-facebook-event-emerges/) page which drew suspicion several years ago from The Tab. [This was reported later as having been cancelled.](http://xmedia.ex.ac.uk/wp/wordpress/38382/)
* The [Wipeout UK pages such as here](https://www.facebook.com/UniversityTourUK/events) are set up by Electric Ents –  the Google Docs form asking for people’s details has the disclaimer in the bottom right hand corner stating [“This form was created inside of Electric Ents,”](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12FZKt2cyqGOml0-jSKJFYMjml3OPMBhm-kwqEI5TR6Q/viewform) which is the signature of the company using a Google Apps account.
* A “[University Applicants”](https://www.facebook.com/UniversityApplicantsUk) page.
*A series of [“Zero Tuition Fees for Students,”](https://www.facebook.com/events/1582800865270254/) pages, asking people to sign a petition with some personal information – the Google Form has now been deleted. The Wipeout UK events were linked to from this also.

Interestingly we stumbled across another website, www.universitycribs.co.uk which is currently asking people to submit their email address and city. This is registered to a Jack Jenkins at the same address as for Volt Marketing Ltd, and he self describes himself on Facebook as “Head Honcho” at Lowercase Events. I think the universitycribs.co.uk is the same business as the Future Residential Ltd I mentioned earlier, as this is registered at the same address called[ Future Residential Ltd and it has Christian Samuels, Daniel Jeffreys and Jack Jenkins registered as the three directors.](http://www.bizdb.co.uk/company/future-residential-limited-09326175/)



The website of the company that Mark Cook talked to originally, Outdoor Cinema, has a [website registered to a company called TOC Productions Ltd](https://who.is/whois/https://www.theoutdoorcinema.co.uk). The address this website is registered to has hundreds of businesses registered to it (looks like an accountants), and the business was incorporated on the 17th, to a [Tanzeel Rehman,](http://www.companydirectorcheck.com/tanzeel-rehman-5) who as well as being the director of TOC Productions Limited, is also director of a number of companies with names like:

Lowercase Marketing Limited
LC X M Events Limited
LCMP Marketing Limited
Lowercase Cardiff Limited
L.C.G. Marketing Ltd
Mayfair Marketing Limited
Tee R Consulting Ltd

Lowercase (in their various incarnations) seem to be pretty dodgy:

* There's a 'protest' page on FB complaining [about them scamming people](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Say-No-To-Lowercase-Events/1578539689066623?fref=ts)

* [Scamming freshers:](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCcQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmancunion.com%2F2012%2F09%2F17%2Fpromoters-mislead-freshers-and-threaten-halls-security%2F&amp;ei=EV0zVfTwFsmXauXFgJgC&amp;usg=AFQjCNF5vqwA5ymR9vw-bAJWWpFixCHWsw&amp;sig2=4eRu7ot5tvoGL-n2xkFviA&amp;bvm=bv.91071109,d.ZWU)

The Facebook page of[ Lowercase Events Cardiff](https://www.facebook.com/LowercaseCardiff?fref=ts) have shared several of the events run by Electric Ents and Christian Samuels, as recently as the 11th April, such as sharing a video to “The Freshers Paint Party UK Tour,” which is also available [on Vimeo under an Electric Ents account.](https://vimeo.com/electricents)

Are the companies linked? It’s certainly interesting given the strict denial given by ""Michael"" of TOC Productions that they were linked to any of the other Facebook pages.

Regardless, I’d question how feasible it is for Electric Ents who’ve at present got a small presence nationally, to go ahead to run multiple large events in over 20 towns and cities, which makes me think they're just collecting data so they can spam email/phone numbers with club night advertisements.",null,0,null,1430417384,null,0,false,0,cqu3ahb,null,t3_34fc5z,null,t1_cqu3ahb,null,t3_34fc5z,null,null,null,1432696891,null,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17,null

HMRC wouldn't really agree with much of what you've said there.

The top 5% of earners have seen their tax liability increase dramatically over the last five years whilst their income relative to the rest of us has decreased, their total contribution to the income tax bill is the highest it has ever been. The bottom 50% have seen their relative incomes increase (albeit not by a huge deal) and they are contributing less to the total income tax bill than at any point.

The last page has the absolute values it takes you to be in the bottom 1,10,20% etc. of earners and you will find that these people are the only one's who's salary increases have outstripped inflation over the last five years.

I know it is not popular in this subreddit, to say so. But whilst George Osborne has been chancellor inequality in incomes has decreased, the lowest paid are have seen their incomes increase above inflation and their tax contributions decrease whilst the richest are paying more than they ever have in tax.

You might think that it's not enough, that is another argument. And this doesn't deal with the people who struggle who are out of work, but on that I would remind you that we have unemployment at record lows, as well as inflation. However I don't think the argument that he has been 'punishing the working poor to make the top earners richer' really is true, just because Owen Jones and Polly Toynbee say it is.",null,0,null,1430417694,null,0,1430418093,0,cqu3hqm,null,t3_34eq4a,null,t1_cqu3hqm,null,t1_cqtzgkl,null,null,null,1432696986,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

He is referred to as the father of Islamism, and rightly so, he clearly defined the need for an Islamic state(by stealing the works of western philosophers and writing them in an Islamic style) and defining the need for a vanguard of Muslims to create that state, its his ideas that survive today. And it's his ideas that define modern islamism. He didn't reference Islam in his definitive work on the Islamic state he used to rail against the ulema (senior Muslims) for refusing to incorporate modern thinking into Islam. This country's leaders has twice dealt with the issue of Islamism in this country under Blair and Cameron and twice they backed away from proscribing Islamist groups like jamaat-e-islami and hizb-al-tahrir. Germany won't tolerate them, they aim to replace the worlds governments with a global caliphate, they are banned across the Islamic world but we tolerate them in this country, fuck that.

In 2013, of the roughly 37 million people who have used cocaine in their lifetime, 4 million had used within the last year (roughly 10%) and 1.5 within the last month (4% give or take).  Of that 4% it's highly doubtful that they're all addicts or are habitual users.  In fact, simply going by the metric of (monthly users)/(lifetime users), and treating that as a measure of addictive potential, cannabis is a clear winner with 17%.

Other interesting facts include the fact that both cocaine and crack have pretty much the same score of 4%, which demolishes the myth that crack is more addictive than regular coke.  Heroin comes out as being only slightly more addictive than crack by this measure, with a score of 6%.  In fact the really high scores, marijuana aside, seem to be associated with abuse of prescription painkillers, which is something that isn't talked about nearly as much.

Of course, the heroin thing isn't really that surprising, since it turns out that if you give people morphine after surgery they don't all become raving smack addicts overnight.  Hell, the stories about [Us soldiers using heroin](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/01/02/144431794/what-vietnam-taught-us-about-breaking-bad-habits) in Vietnam then giving up relatively easily when they came back should interest us.

You get a clean bed, needle, etc. and work through your hit in a green room away from the public. Why break into cars or go on the game to pay some dealer for shit smack when you can get it for free?

Coke? Get a Certificate of Responsibility from the local drug clinic and be provided two modest hits in a single-use plastic dispenser (with your certificate number printed on it). If you're arrested while under the influence, or your dispenser is found on the street as litter or your health is suffering when you renew your certificate, you go in for treatment, penalties, fines (whatever's appropriate).

Crack? Same as heroin.

Weed? It's sold more-or-less the same as cigarettes and comes from licensed farms when sold retail.

MDMA? Similar to cocaine, but you're screened for raised risk of dopamine/serotonin deficiencies and advised and coached appropriately. Maybe it could be cut with something that causes xerostomia (dry mouth) so to encourage water consumption. 

The cost of all this could quite easily be covered by duty/tax on the difference between commercial manufacture and illegal street cost.

I like Toksvig on the whole, but she actually seems to have a pretty unfashionably gendered outlook on this whole subject; explicitly gendering the party name, focusing exclusively on women's issues and even describing ""pragmatic and solution-oriented thinking"" as a characteristically *female* approach, instead of a gender-neutral (let alone stereotypically male, as it's more popularly usually conceptualised) one.

Some minor problems...

- Pedestrians on shared walkways; The bell is a warning that a cyclist is approaching and it's maybe not a good idea to make any sudden sidesteps. For some reason people panic when they hear a bike bell and start flailing about.
- The bike docks are slow to respond and occasionally wont respond at all. Hoping they can improve this.
- When the suns out, the bikes disappear pretty quickly in some areas. Guess thats a good sign though.
- the app is well designed but poorly built. Looks like a WebUI packaged up. It's functional though.

Otherwise, I'm having a great time with the bikes.

While the infrastructure is crap, I've managed to cycle past the police on the footpath several times and never been stopped. Assuming they're gonna let that one slide as long as you're not being reckless. I have been told you're allowed to use the footpath if you feel it's unsafe to use the road (which IMO is any road in Belfast), but I can't find any evidence to support that.

You dont need to take my word for it, Irfan Ahmed wrote a great book on Maududi https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5De09u2P_JYC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66 Start from the second paragraph. 

Mauduis work was extended by the Muslim Brotherhood's Sayyed Qutb, who argued that because muslims were living in a  state of pre-islamic ignorance (Maududis opinion) they werent muslims at all and it was therefore okay for the vanguard to kill them since they werent actually muslims. He also thought christians were polytheists. Qutb was a nutbag of the first order, his ideas go against the very writings of the koran. Those two guys defined moden islamism. Its a political theory less than a hundred years old, its not even particularly islamic. Neither were either of them islamic authorities. 

Im not making excuses, I really have no need. 

I also recommend reading ed husains the islamist, Maajid Nawaz's radical or Gilles Kepel's Jihad, all great books.

Search for those courses using that link and compare the courses. You'll need to apply by January 2016 to start in September 2016. You'll need to narrow your choice down to one or two very similar courses. This is because you need to write a personal statement which is a few paragraphs on why you want to study the course and include any previous work, studies or hobbies which are relevant. So if you waffle on about an irrelevant course, you're unlikely to get onto it.

Be careful though when looking up the uni names. For example, Oxford university is a top uni. Oxford Brookes is not. *Usually* if a uni has the word met/metropolitan in it's name, then it's not as good as the other uni in that city, but some departments might be quite good.

null,false,jakub70,eu,European Union,null,"&gt; Governments spending has dropped from 45% to 40% of GDP. Why should we care? 

The deficit fell and the taxes didn't rise. That's a success from an economical point of view. Especially if you agree, as the article does, that the effectiveness oh the public sector was largely unaffeccted.

&gt; One million public sector jobs lost (hooray for unemployment)

I'm not sure if you're being serious here. The coalition managed to cut 1 million taxpayer funded jobs, which were apprently needless. Once again, a big success.

&gt; There's a lot to unpack here. Firstly, really? The threat that we've heard over and over again in recent years, that if you tax, regulate or even harshly criticise the corporations and/or the very rich that they will all run away to a desert island, like the plot of some Ayn Rand novel, and the rest of us peasants will be left wallowing in our own filth cursing ourselves for our own greed and stupidity, quite apart from sounding a bit like extortion, is probably a bluff. The vast majority of ""global talent that London attracts"" are nowhere near rich enough to be affected by the mansion tax or non-dom rules. A few might be affected by a 50% top rate (on income over £150,000), but if they really cared that much about taxation they would be in Dubai, or Hong Kong and not London. London has more to offer than just a tax haven for the very rich, people come here because it's London and they have to put up with ridiculously expensive housing and wonky transport, but they think it's worth it. To believe that a marginal increase in the marginal rate of tax of the already very well off will be a deterrent is a bit delusional. Finally, and most importantly this sentence implies that people should decide on how to vote in a national election based on how attractive London might be to a small number of wealthy expats. Breathtakingly parochial.

Are you genuinely incable of seeing that there is a whole spectrum of possibile outcomes between a libertarian paradise and a communist hellhole? If you are to make a choice between a party that wants to excarbate the already serious relative decline of London and a one that doesn't, is it a big surprise that the Economist goes with the latter? Especially that they excoriated the 50p tax rate in a whole separate article.

&gt; Miliband might also ""meddle"" in markets widely regarded as broken

By imposing price controls:

&gt;Rather than using the state to boost competition, Mr Miliband wants a heavier state hand in markets—which betrays an ill-founded faith in the ingenuity and wisdom of government.

Which a very reasonable, or at the very least consistent policy line.

&gt; risk of the ""disaster"" of a British exit from the EU

Is it impossible to be in favour of the democratic process in principle but then disagree with a possible outcome? TE supported the Scottish independence referendum but opposed the Scottish independence.

&gt; Vote Conservative! You can almost taste the cognitive dissonance between their hard analytical journalism and their ideological inflexibility.

1. “I absolutely believe in these debates and think they are great.” – David Cameron and Jeremy Thompson, Sky news, 14 April 2010

2. “I think it is great we are having these debates and I hope they go someway to restore some of the faith and some of the trust into our politics because we badly need that once again in this country.” – David Cameron, Leaders Debate, ITV, 15 April 2010

3. “Look, I’ve been calling for these debates for five years, I challenged Blair, I challenged Brown, I challenged when I was ahead in the polls, and when I was behind in the polls. I just think they are a good thing.” – David Cameron, Daily Telegraph, 17 April 2010

4. “I’ve always wanted these debates to happen. I mean they happen in every country. They even happen in Mongolia for heaven’s sake and it’s part of the modern age that we should be in.” – David Cameron, BBC3, 21 April 2010

5. “I think these debates are here to stay. They clearly engage people in politics which is what we need.” – David Cameron, News of the World, 2 May 2010

6. “If you want the TV debates to go ahead you have got to do it fairly between the main parties and look, having said I want them, having challenged people to have them and quite right, Sky saying let’s have them, it would have been feeble to find some excuse to back out so I thought we’ve got to stick at this, we’ve got to do it.  It will be challenging, it was, but I think I came through them.” – David Cameron, Sky News, 3 May 2010

7. “You know we’ve been going on for years about let’s have these debates and I think it really vindicated having that.  I think people will be asking themselves why on earth, what was all the fuss about? Why on earth didn’t we have these things before?  We should have done and it’s great they’re underway now and I think we’ll have them in every election in the future and I think that’s a really good thing for our democracy.” – David Cameron, BBC Radio Manchester, 16 April 2014

8. “On TV debates, I’m in favour of them, I think they’re good and we should go on having them and I will certainly play my part in trying to make that happen.” – David Cameron, Coalition mid term review, 7th Jan 2012

9. “I think TV debates are good. I enjoyed them last time – particularly the last one.” – David Cameron, David Cameron, Press Association, 10th December 2012

10. “Blair pulled out against, against Major and Major pulled out against Kinnock, Thatcher pulled out against Callaghan. I’ve just always believed that these need to happen. It’s good for democracy.  It’s good to see.” – David Cameron and Allan Beswick, BBC Radio Manchester, 16 April 2014

When it comes to the 'euro' zone. Britian has had a lot of experience in this with the HUGELY beneficial 'Sterling area' which is the building pillar of the financial system today and in how London is so solid when it comes to a central pillar in the world's markets.

also not to mention the UK's quite significant position in the whole EU system. Lots of voting power. I'm not sure why the EU is seen as 'Merkel' (greece?) but it could quite as easily be seen as the UK. The other benefit we're the only English speaking lot (which is something btw!)

And Tottenham's schedule is quite different from most teams in the league this year, you're completely off on that point, thirteen teams had no European football this year, Spurs were one of seven to have it and they were one of two teams to get to the final of the season's first Cup final as well.

null,false,werdlyfe,null,null,null,"Yes...the 2014/15 season has been a failure for Liverpool FC. No doubt.

No trophies. No Champions League next season. The total goal tally is HALF of what it was last year at this point. We lost both matches to Manchester United. We even failed to beat Everton this season. 

It has been a disaster season. I don't know how much of the blame for our failures can be pointed at Brendan Rodgers though.

Luis Suarez is the reason for Liverpool's failures this season. His departure left a giant responsibility on the squad to continue the success of 2013/14 without the star of the show. BR and the club were ready to give that responsibility to our other main-man Daniel Sturridge. Unfortunately, Studge has been out of the squad to injury for a majority of the season. So the star of the squad became Raheem Sterling, a 19/20 year old who is not talented enough for it. Not yet. Maybe not ever?

Although I still love Suarez as a footballer and he will always be a Red in my eyes. The day he left the club was the defining day of this season. Rodgers did his best to work with what he had, control the damage, and get us playing competitively considering all the unfortunates. 

With that being said... I do feel a managerial change may be best for the club moving forward. This season was an utter disaster for the club, and it might be best to turn the page and start fresh. I really hate to admit that, because I really like Rodgers and his character as a manager. But I fear we may be headed for a few mores years of mediocrity under his guard, as he continues ""his project"".

If anything Liverpool supporters do not want. Is more years of mediocrity. Liverpool Football Club is the greatest club in the world and deserves to be playing in Champions League every year, competing for the league and winning trophies.

Another dutchman, Wijnaldum is a very good utility player and can play almost anywhere in the midfield quite well. Everyone always says Depay from PSV, but I think he would be a good realistic target for us.

Pedro would be a good value signing if we actually end up getting rid of all the forwards we plan on.

Overall I think we need a starting RB, another CB if we get rid of Toure, at least 1 forward, and another midfielder.

Price stabilisation is a long term plan, it deals with the underlying issue which is that we simply haven't built enough houses and there is so much stock that is in a bad state. If supply goes up this bad stock will be replaced over time and housing standards go up.

Using more oil looks like it should actually be green. It doesn't cost an arm and a leg to fill up your tank here and we like to go offroading etc. We also aren't the size of a small state like Delaware so there is more road to travel, hence more oil burned.  

You may spend 2.4 times on healthcare but you won't die waiting around for your turn. Make that one green.  

You spend more on electricity because we don't have a weenie government putting caps on what you can juice out of the lines and into your supercharged computer or home entertainment system. Another one changed to green.  

40% more money.  No brainer. 

6% less free time, because we're the guys who do our jobs, you must be the other guys.  

39% more of a lass divide. I'd love to see how they arrived at that number.   Toss this one out for being bullshit!  

3x more likely to get AIDs, unless you're straight then who cares?  

39% more likely to die in infancy. I admit we have a lot of stupid people here and a lot of them have kids. Tis' sad.  Next!  

1.39% more likely to be unemployed. Yeah if you are a lazy ass do nothing!  Real Americans invent their own job if no one can take them on!  

Live 0.86 years less. Who even gives a shit?  

Have 9.82% more babies. See infant mortality rate.  

Things they left out:  

Have 100% more freedom! So living in the USA still is and always will be better than being a Limey.  (In all seriousness these are some pretty stupid criteria to compare countries by...)

When the BBC began regular radio (and later television) news bulletins, the newspaper proprietors of the day were petrified.

It also happened that newspaper proprietors in those days were powerful and influential men. If you think Murdoch has power and influence today, it's nothing compared to what people like Lord Beaverbrook had in their day. The result of this was that when the BBC received its first Royal Charter it was required by law to be impartial. This clause was a direct result of the newspaper proprietors whispering to their friends in government about how potentially subversive and dangerous broadcast news could be

With the 'single transferable vote' (STV) system of proportional representation that we use for the Stormont Assembley, I shared my vote last time between: PBPA, SF, SDLP and Alliance (first choice to Gerry Carroll from PBPA). I normally vote SF in general elections, not out of bitterness against my Unionist neighbours, but rather I genuinely support their social policies, including equal rights for LGBT people - something bitterly opposed by the vast majority of Unionist politicians.

&gt;Why Adulterate with Levamisole?  

&gt;According to the DEA, levamisole--as well as other adulterants--is apparently present in some shipments of cocaine intercepted before they are broken up for further distribution to consumers. Considering that, in one batch, only 6% by weight of the total product sold as cocaine was levamisole, it seems possible it is more than simply a bulking agent. One theory is that levamisole or other adulterants boost the effects of cocaine, permitting material to pass for higher-quality product despite additional cuts made down the line. Another theory is that levamisole or other adulterants are added as chemical signatures used to track distribution of material.[Fucci 2007] It may be that levamisole has been used because it has similar solubility properties to cocaine and therefore is difficult to remove and has not previously been considered a serious health hazard. As of October 1, 2009, there is no definitive answer as to why it is used as a cocaine adulterant.",null,0,null,1430426195,null,0,false,0,cqu93fv,null,t3_34e0gb,null,t1_cqu93fv,null,t1_cqu3idg,null,null,null,1432699696,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Under Wilson and 85% income tax, 98% 'unearned', we actually weren't generating considerably more revenues than we were under Thatcher for example (although other macro factors did play a huge part there). Either way, I am rambling, the point is, I don't agree with the conservatives cheekily including in their manifesto a law to freeze tax rates and raise inheritance tax (clearly just a way to push it through lords without needing approval), but I agree we need to bring the deficit into check and back down to the £40 billion late 1990s rate at a maximum.

**C+UKIP**:
Personally I think that these two will be the best, they both aim to fix the economy and the problems we are facing, however, like I said about the Greens and house of commons, Conservatives has too many upper class members that they have built a cloud where they thing everyone is rich like them, hence David Cameron's taxes he has added, which I won't hate on him for, it makes sense, the only problem is that this cloud within his party blinds him from one simple fact, **not everyone is on a pile of money and can pay these taxes**. This is where I believe that UKIP may help, since(as far as i'm aware) UKIP has more middle/working class people within it, they will hopefully keep Conservatives in line when it comes to dealing with other classes.

I do know from my own experience of living in France that most legal and other barriers that you would face if you tried to emigrate (say) to Canada are really not an issue. No slow, expensive visa applications (which might be rejected) or other tedious paperwork. There's nothing stopping you from just turning up in France and starting a life there.

By contrast, try getting the right to live and work indefinitely in Switzerland as a foreigner (esp. given that the Swiss have just tightened their immigration policy in relation to the EU). My point is that without EU law to standardise visa/naturalisation policy, individual European countries would set their own policies, and they could easily make things a lot harder for expats and migrant workers if they wanted to (think of Orban in Hungary, and yes, the Golden Dawn in Greece, without the constraints of EU law).",null,0,null,1430430799,null,0,false,0,cqubyk7,null,t3_34edl1,null,t1_cqubyk7,null,t1_cqublrr,null,null,null,1432701048,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

null,false,seamushoo4,lfc68,,null,"ridiculous? look at how much money chelsea, man u, city, psg, barca, madrid, bayern, etc... spend each year. now look at how we rank financially against these teams. we are a step back from them, but a peg above many other teams because we are 10th in revenues. 

now given that we spent 100m + last year, look at where else our squad is now ailing. we are about to offload 3-4 strikers, leaving us 2 on our books. we are losing arguably the best ever premier league era player *emphasis on arguably because im sure you as well as many others have an opinion* who is a central midfielder, leaving us with hendo, allen, lucas, can...and lucas could yet LEIV..A. we have no guarantee that we will have a healthy rb to start the season. glen johnson is leaving. flanno is hurt for 9 months. manquillo always has the chance of being recalled. enrique is certain to leave, meaning moreno is our ONLY healthy full back to be on the squad next year.

i hope that this really highlights that the spending we engaged in last year might not have been the best for an immediate impact, but we needed to rebuild again. we have a core group of players who are being tied down (ibe and skrtel next, sterling to follow soon). we will need to sign at least 1 rb (can always promote another academy graduate and wait until flanno is healthy. randall or mclaughlin maybe.) we will need another lb if enrique leaves, if not brad smith might stay, but i've heard rumors he's not signing another deal with us. migs is our undisputed starter and has shown true grit this season. we have some academy graduates so back up gk is low down my pecking order. we then need to sign a cm who will control games in a way that hendo, allen or can cannot right now. someone like pjanic, but i don't know who the answer would be. otherwise, we run with allen, hendo, lucas (permitted he doesn't want to leave and push for a move) and can + rossiter/chiravella/brannagan. we are set with wingers for now, but it wouldn't hurt to bring someone else in like a depay who can double as a goalscorer in the #9 role, because well, sturridge isn't reliable. 

so in summary, we need at least 1 pure striker, another goalscoring attacker (depay type of player), 1 CM, 1 rb, 1 back up lb. a goalscorer alone, who by the way this sub keeps talking won't be acceptable unless we spend 30m+ on them and is named martinez, benzema or suarez, should cost us around 20-25m. a starting quality rb would cost us approx 15m. a cm would cost no less than 20m. a back up lb would be around 5. that right there is plausibly 75m. we would be foolish as a club not to invest that type of money, provided we identify targets that are good for BR and the club. I think the transfers we made this past offseason will show some benefit into next season. balo, lambo will be gone, but lallana and lovren will find some form and prove valuable. origi, marko, can and moreno are all 22 or younger, and will grow. manquillo is a low risk move and if he stays with us, i'll be ecstatic because he's another young gun who's got serious potential. 

not as ludicrous as you think, you need to remember the 2013-14 season was masked by two guys who literally scored 51 goals between them, and suarez drew close to 10 pks himself, providing stevie with 10 and sterling scored 9, a lot of which were made possible by danny boy and luis' movement. alone, that's 70 goals pretty much directly influenced by SAS and we lost them this year. we also bled the most goals since like 93-94 when we gave up 55 goals. the defense was shambolic, and skrtel/sahko were a good partnership, but we needed more consistent quality. 

you can point the finger at fsg for failed transfers from the first few seasons, but point is, the starting XI isn't good enough right now. and they would be wise to invest upwards of 100m again if they really want to compete again. make a big signing early on, and let the snowball effect take place on people wanting to join in on this project, granted we can sell people on the project. i for one think our team is in an arsenal warp right now and are only a couple pieces away from being top 4 competitive and probably about 4 pieces away from this current squad being title competitive. a healthy sturridge, coutinho, sterling, hendo, sahko, skrtel and migs core + pieces around those guys is a pretty solid team, and one that we need to build around, starting this summer.

null,false,hexag1,null,null,null,"'Islamophobia' has a long and illustrious history. Have a look at what former US President John Quincy Adams had to say about Islam, in 1830:

&gt;In the seventh century of the Christian era, a wandering Arab of the lineage of Hagar, the Egyptian, combining the powers of transcendent genius, with the preternatural energy of a fanatic, and the fraudulent spirit of an impostor, proclaimed himself as a messenger from Heaven, and spread desolation and delusion over an extensive portion of the earth. Adopting from the sublime conception of the Mosaic law, the doctrine of one omnipotent God; he connected indissolubly with it, the audacious falsehood, that he was himself his prophet and apostle. Adopting from the new Revelation of Jesus, the faith and hope of immortal life, and of future retribution, he humbled it to the dust, by adapting all the rewards and sanctions of his religion to the gratification of the sexual passion. He poisoned the sources of human felicity at the fountain, by degrading the condition of the female sex, and the allowance of polygamy; and he declared undistinguishing and exterminating war, as a part of his religion, against all the rest of mankind. THE ESSENCE OF HIS DOCTRINE WAS VIOLENCE AND LUST: TO EXALT THE BRUTAL OVER THE SPIRITUAL PART OF HUMAN NATURE.

&gt;Between these two religions, thus contrasted in their characters, a war of twelve hundred years has already raged. That war is yet flagrant; nor can it cease but by the extinction of that imposture, which has been permitted by Providence to prolong the degeneracy of man. While the merciless and dissolute dogmas of the false prophet shall furnish motives to human action, there can never be peace upon earth, and good will towards men. The hand of Ishmael will be against every man, and every man’s hand against him. It is, indeed, amongst the mysterious dealings of God, that this delusion should have been suffered for so many ages, and during so many generations of human kind, to prevail over the doctrines of the meek and peaceful and benevolent Jesus (The American Annual Register for the Years 1827-8-9, volume 29:269, capitals in orig.).

&gt; The precept of the koran is, perpetual war against all who deny, that Mahomet is the prophet of God. The vanquished may purchase their lives, by the payment of tribute; the victorious may be appeased by a false and delusive promise of peace; and the faithful follower of the prophet, may submit to the imperious necessities of defeat: but the command to propagate the Moslem creed by the sword is always obligatory, when it can be made effective. The commands of the prophet may be performed alike, by fraud, or by force ((The American Annual Register for the Years 1827-8-9, volume 29:274)",null,1,null,1430431489,null,0,false,0,cqucdb6,null,t3_34dyvg,null,t1_cqucdb6,null,t3_34dyvg,null,null,null,1432701239,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Our courses for Bachelor degrees are 3 years, not 4, for a start. And as others have said, you apply for your specific subject from the start. 

As your education system is ~1-2 years behind us (you start later than us) some students can find the step up really difficult.

Costs can vary. But you're guaranteed to be paying more than £12,000 per year (~$18,000). If you're at a Russell Group university then that can go over $30,000.

The Russell Group is our equivalent of the Ivy League. Highly prestigious, competitive universities. If you're not getting a competitive GPA and SAT score then you're not going to get in. On that note - universities here care far more about grades than anything else. Yes volunteering and being varsity captain is great. But they don't really care. 

Contact the universities to get specifics on the GPA and SAT score they'd be looking for for your course.

Living costs are roughly the same if you equate the city size. Eg; New York/LA - London, Boston - Manchester. Etc. but you probably won't need a car. 

So what you need to do:

Decide on your major subject. Think carefully about where you can realistically get to. Contact those universities to check your grades are in line with what they want.

null,false,StillMostlyClueless,null,null,null,"Okay a few reasons why a government debt is not a household debt.

**Nations (rarely ever) die.**

The UK is never going to need to settle all its debts when it dies because it's going to be around forever. There is no worry that the UK might be hit by a car tomorrow and leave you out of pocket.

**Debt can be fixed by the Goverment in ways a Household can't.**

A household can't print more money to pay off their debt, or levy higher taxes on people to solve their debt. All you got is your income which is hard to change. A government can change its income at any time by changing taxes or just issue more ""IOU's"" in the form of more printed money. It comes with downsides, either people angry at high taxes or increased inflation or a loss of currency value. But you don't end up broke.

If you don't control your currency you can't print IOU's and you come into problems. This is where Ireland and Greece are at because they're using the Euro and don't get to issue themselves more money to pay off their debts.


**Government debt isn't unusual.**

Britain has been in debt since the 17th Century. We have never come out of debt since then. We can do this because we pay back loans with interest, then just keep taking out new ones to spend on all the things the country needs. People know we will pay their loan back, Britain has a very good credit rating. Lending money to Britain is a safe but slow way to make money. For a household, you might be able to do this if your job is REALLY secure. But most loan companies at some point will go ""Oh wait, if you lose your job we're screwed. Yeah you're not getting any more money."" or at least worry that you've been in debt for three hundred years. Not a safe investment.

""...the Green Party offers this idea of just switching to a nice austerity-free utopia while other parties offer an actual plan (the flaws of which we can quibble over for hours) that theoretically takes us from now to point X on the road to something better.""

The Green Party has goals that would fundamentally change this country, what they fail to convince me of is that they have a practical set of steps to achieve them or an appreciation that the time scale they have set is never going to happen. 

As for ""Who do you think will actually make a big change for the better?""
I pretty much believe that a big change will not happen suddenly in a democratic society.  It just can't and it doesn't matter what party or parliament is in power.  However, small change culminates and has seen this country transform over the last 100 years and it is just not the case that the ""big parties"" never serve to make things better.

He's made a lot of mistakes. these are things you must account for when you predict a teams success. 

Seeing as how we failed to sign any real depth in crucial areas, 2 injuries are easily enough to derail an entire season, especially when the injured players are out for a majority of the season. i'm not trying to say we did NOT fail in our transfers. What i'm saying is that it was fucking obvious we failed miserably in the transfer window so even before we started I did not see us getting top 4 or doing well in CL.

There isn't a pot of money, we've been in debt for more than a hundred years, but yes there was more money that we could have borrowed and  spent.

&gt; Did spending increase ahead of GDP? Your own link shows it did.

It shows it decreasing from 42% in 1997 to 37% in 2008 - hardly an increase. There were short term variations within that period but you can show anything by picking an arbitrary timescale.

&gt; Let me guess, the IMF is just lizards, economists are wrong, unless they happen to share your exact political views, in which case they are irrefutable.

The IMF has at various points [criticised austerity](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22623519), suggested it be [toned down](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/18/george-osborne-imf-austerity) and supported it to various extents.

Two-thirds of economists now think austerity was damaging:-

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/two-thirds-of-economists-say-coalition-austerity-harmed-the-economy-10149410.html

null,false,famasfilms,null,null,null,"Great question.

The simple answer to your question is that in 2007 before the crisis UK debt to GDP was 43%, compared to 67% in Germany and 107% in Greece.  Economist Mark Blyth has said the only Country guilty of spending their way into economic trouble was Greece.

The figures are visible here  http://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;idim=country:uk:de:fr&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en

Secondly, you need to understand that Governments constantly switch between running a budget surplus and a budget deficit.  Using the above link, change it to display government surplus/deficit and you can see that in 1996 the Tory govt was running a deficit of 4.3%, by 1998 the Labour govt had reduced that deficit to 0.1% and reached a surplus of 3.5% by 2000.  So basically they wiped out the Tory deficit they had inherited....why Ed doesn't mention that is beyond me.

Ok, so a surplus means that the govt is receiving more money than it spends.  Clearly it cannot do that for long because people would start calling for tax cuts and for the government to spend more....

So spend more is what Labour did, and by 2002 we were running a budget deficit of 2.1%. From 2002 to the crisis, our deficit stayed at between 2-3.5% - compared to 5.7% in Greece.

The problem was that Labour was running a deficit when the banking crisis hit the economies of the US, UK and EU.  This was a crisis that NOBODY ANYWHERE anticipated or saw coming.  This was a crisis caused by increasingly relaxed regulation of the banks.  This relaxed regulation was STARTED in the 80s by Reagan/Thatcher and continued by New Labour.  If the Tories were in power instead of Labour then the outcome would probably have been the same.  

The subprime banking crisis meant that the banks in the US and UK had to be bailed out by the governments.  This meant that the govt injected public money into the banks, taking a stake in the banks but also taking a stake of their debt.  As the banking system was on its knees, this meant the tax revenue they contributed to UK GDP took a massive hit.

So we can see that:

1.  The banks aren't giving as much as tax revenue for the UK which means UK GDP falls.  Which will then mean our debt to gdp ratio gets worse, even without any extra spending.
2.  The UK government injects the banks with cash and inherits the banks debt.  Which means the UK debt to gdp ratio suddenly looks a lot worse.
3.  The banking crisis then spreads to the wider economy, people lose their jobs and spending on welfare naturally increases as more people fall back on the safety net.

So we can see that as a result of the banking crisis, UK GDP fell, UK spending had to go up and UK debt was also increased as a result of saving the banks.  All those things suddenly take the debt to gdp ratio from 43% in 2007 to 67% in 2009 and 78.4% in 2010.

Basically, Labour was damned if they do, damned if they don't.  They did not cause the crash, spending did not cause the crash.  UK Debt to GDP ratio and budget deficit was a SYMPTOM of the crash, not the cause.

What the Tories don't mention is that they would have had to have acted in a similar fashion, and they could easily have relaxed bank regulation even more.

It really frustrates and angers me that Cameron/Osborne keep referring to the ""mess Labour left behind"" and claim the UK could have ended up like Greece.  We still have a central bank, which means that we can print money to an extent.

It also annoys me that Labour/Milliband are so ineffective at defending themselves.  Ed was right to highlight a global economic crisis but I wish he would pull out the above figures I've quoted and shut people up!

null,false,oldcat,null,null,null,"This article is pretty awful, it's written as a propaganda piece using examples that are pretty crap. Firstly:

&gt; Their pledge that the referendum would be a “once in a generation” event

This was never a pledge, find me a point where it was in a manifesto, or ever promised not just said in passing. A referendum, like the one on AV, generally is once in a generation. That was what was expected and used as a way to convince voters who were unsure but edging towards Yes. It wasn't a promise and to paint it as such is one of the plethora of stupid lines from Labour that have been seen right through. If we have another referendum it will be because the people of Scotland have asked for it by voting SNP in the Scottish Parliament. Move on. 

The comment on Neil Hay also missed the point. Don't get me wrong he's a cock, he's a cock for deciding that Scottish accents are required to participate in a debate in Scotland, he tweeted a Daily Mash article with Quisling in the title including it's exact title and everyone jumps up and down yelling 'HE CALLED US ALL NAZIS'. Seriously, this is the height of Labour's strategy in Scotland. Miss the obvious open goal and in stead let Wings Over Scotland, like the Daily Express if you replaced Diana with Independence, write articles that are actually reasonable pointing out their obvious nonsense. If Scottish Labour could stop making reasonable people have to agree with WOS maybe they'd stop losing them in droves. I hope Ian Murray keeps his seat, he's a good MP, he works hard and has said he will vote with any party if it's for something positive for his constituents. Surely what we all want from and MP. He looks likely to lose and his party are responsible...

Moving on from how poorly written this Labour propaganda piece is (yes Labour propaganda is largely being angry at the SNP just now, no I don't get it either), the over all point of this article forgets the other side of the party divide in its desperation to toe that Labour line and jump on the SNP. It ignores why the SNP are on course to win this election and then another in 2016, increasing their vote share each time, a rare feat. To illustrate this, here is the choice I have to make. I have two options of parties I would consider voting for, I have voted for both in the past and voted for Alastair Darling last GE. Those choice are:

SNP: They have one core principle, independence. That is entirely locked up in democratic processes, they can't do it if we don't let them. So in the mean time their aim is to keep the electorate on side. They do things people want to vote for. (Why this isn't politics 101 in the Cambridge Uni PPE degree is beyond me but, seriously, it turns out it works.) They have cocked up, quite a bit to be honest, funding free tuition by cutting college places is probably the best example. Money from poorer kids straight to the middle classes. Not ok. Labour let them off the hook completely and this is now rarely brought up. Admittedly their record on HE and FE isn't exactly stellar but they failed to land a single blow. All in all I like the SNP, Nicola is a decent leader, she is pretty lefty in a way Salmond never was. Her party may not have principles but she does and I'm hopeful the SNP has learned from the referendum and changed for the positive. It wasn't the SNP who had undecideds splitting 2:1 Yes:No in the latter stages, it was groups like National Collective and other genuine grass roots campaigns with positive messages. It remains to be seen if the SNP have really changed but their 2016 manifesto will be the first after their influx of members. If they become less top down and find principles in these new members they could do even better than they are now.

...or...

Labour: A party founded on principles that I love, the collectivism, trade unions, all of that. They're great principles. Reality just isn't the same, Labour are focus grouped to Hell and all about the 3rd way. £6k uni fees are a great example. What principle does that follow? It's a middle of the road policy that won't stop anyone being put off uni by debt and doesn't really change anything. The rest of the message they are shouting from the rooftops is that everything Dave says about them is not true. Their manifesto isn't a principled document, it's all about not being what Dave says they are. We'll cut the deficit but not quite so much as they will. Labour now have one principle and it's not far off the SNP's, their one principle is that they should be in charge. They want power more than they care about any other principle. They are lost.

Why are Labour not finishing off an unpopular Tory led Government and taking back a majority? They don't need Scotland on board to win one, we're massively outnumbered. It's not because Ed isn't PM material, he's largely changed that image and the polls haven't moved. The party has utterly lost its way and I would love them to find it again. The thought of the scale of SNP victory next year is scary, even for someone likely to vote for them. Large majority rule always ends in a party losing its way and forgetting it needs an electorate. That way bad things happen. 

So come on Labour, stop demonising the SNP and start living up to those founding principles, to some of your great names and greater deeds. You created NHS but right now, if we didn't have one, you'd just be campaigning for a price freeze on health insurance payments.

So there were no other witnesses. Just one persons word against another's, presumably NO DNA or physical evidence of rape. Yet somehow the CPS decided that there was enough evidence to take it to trial. 

I have no doubt a jury would have given a not guilty verdict due to insufficient evidence anyway.

Why did the CPS take this further? Are they being pressured regardless of the merits of a case?

Europe tends to be Social Democratic and anti war whilst the English political elite haven't come to terms with the end of the British Empire, and are contemptuous of social democratic values.

As much as those collections from Sleek and the like seem really nice at first, often you'll find that whilst you really like the way a company formulates their eyeshadows and blushes, you hate their foundations and lip products (or some other combination of products), so all the stuff you don't like just gets wasted.

I love my MakeUp Revolution Iconic 2 palette and use it frequently even though it was only £4, so I would definitely suggest trying a couple of those in a variety of colours. I think they have a nice-looking inexpensive blush palette too. I love cheap palettes because even if you only find two or three shades that you love and wear every day, you've still paid a very reasonable price to get that much use out of them.

At the early stage of learning what you like and dislike in makeup products (colour family, texture, undertones, longevity, scent, coverage etc etc) I would take advantage of things like the Boots 3 for 2 deals to try out multiple different formulas of lip product or mascara, eyeshadow quads, blushes and concealers until you get to know what you are looking for in a product, rather than trying a pre-set collection of products where you get no choice of customisation for what you really want/need.

It's very disappointing when you shell out for just one product and it doesn't do it for you, and it FEELS like more of a bargain when you get loads of stuff in a bundle, but I look at all the makeup I have laying around that I never use because it was on sale or came with another product and I thought I was getting a great deal and nahhh, it's usually a false economy buying selections.",null,0,null,1430437170,null,0,1430533922,0,cqufjq3,null,t3_34emgm,null,t1_cqufjq3,null,t3_34emgm,null,null,null,1432702747,null,5,false,MakeUpAddictionUK,t5_319vn,5,null

null,false,Shaper_pmp,null,null,null,"&gt; A lot of people believe (not entirely incorrectly) that general equality is achieved through female empowerment and representation.

That's nice for women, but it doesn't do a lot for people of colour, disabled people, LGBT folks or the hundreds of other disadvantaged groups in society.  Is it primarily about ""equality"", then, or about ""making sure women get theirs""?

I don't mean that point as harshly as it may sound, incidentally, but it's a valid question about any group that claims to fight for ""equality"" but focuses entirely or mainly on advancing the interests of one particular group over all others..

&gt; As females are traditionally the ones who suffer from inequality.

I think those other groups (PoC, LGBT, disabled, etc) might have something to say about that.

Which is kind of the point of any criticism leveled at a party primarily composed of people from a group that dedicates itself entirely towards helping that group - it's great for that group, but it's no more generous or enlightened than the rich, old, white guys looking out for the interests of rich, old white guys.

Sure they're the underdogs, but their attitudes and position aren't any more *moral* than the overdogs they're railing against.  They're just (currently, right now) more disadvantaged.

&gt; There's nothing wrong with a party that promotes women's interests or equality. Or even the two combined.

That's true, but it also tends to make people uneasy when a group tries to annex the moral high ground while simultaneously dedicating itself primarily or entirely to advancing the interests of one single group.

It's dangerous and counter-productive to view every single problem in the world through the lens of one single issue (gender-relations, sexuality, race, etc), as it tends to blind you to all the other issues in the world, some of which may actually be *more* important in any given situation.

It also inherently presupposes that the preferred group is always, automatically the party most in need of giving a leg up.  That's fine when you're talking about a lot of issues where it's manifestly the case, but it easily becomes a habit of thought and can get very dangerous in some situations.

For example, could you really, automatically trust a party overtly and avowedly dedicated to advancing the cause of women's rights to come to a fair and equitable position on the minority of cases where men might actually suffer a *dis*advantage, like child custody hearings or an absence of domestic violence shelters or assistance for male victims?

And as (hopefully) society becomes more and more equal, do you think such groups will *ever* announce that they've ""finally achieved equality"" and rename themselves or disband?  Or will they merely fixate all the more on the ever-shrinking (and ever-more-debatable) pools of remaining imbalance, or tip over the edge into demanding *privilege* and special treatment instead of merely equality?

Don't get me wrong - I'm not some rabid men's rights fanatic, and I don't think most of society is anywhere near that tipping point yet.  Women are hugely disadvantaged by society in a number of different ways, and men have it far easier in most situations... but there's a general principle at work here, and in any conflict or imbalance in society I don't think there's anything wrong with being suspicious of a party that simultaneously claims to be in favour of equality and yet unilaterally and exclusively declares its loyalty for one particular side.

We're talking about men and women here, obviously, but this isn't specifically a criticism exclusively of Toksvig's party - it's a general point that adherents of these groups often misunderstand that applies equally well to ""equality"" groups in favour of *any* defined group or identity - whether it's women's rights, men's rights, ethnic minorities, LGBT groups, etc.

These are all worthwhile causes, but fundamentally your group is first and foremost either about *equality*, or it's about *backing a side*.  If you explicitly back a side then your claims of supporting equality inherently ring hollow or unreliable for a lot of people.",null,0,null,1430437727,null,0,1430490438,0,cqufv36,null,t3_34e69m,null,t1_cqufv36,null,t1_cqu4wzp,null,null,null,1432702897,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

         Lallana                    Sterling

This is basically a 4-6-0.

Coutinho will be a False 9 with Sterling and Lallana sat either side of him, not quite as wingers, but left and right forwards who could drift wide but will primarily cut inside. 

The width would come from the fullbacks with Allen and Henderson pushing up to give them options to pass back.

When Coutinho comes deep to collect the ball, Lallana and Sterling drop into the middle to give him options, and vice-versa they go wide if Coutinho is attacking forward. 

Can will be a deep midfielder allowing Hendo and Allen to press deeper and he can occasionally do his thing and go on a surging run. His vision would be good from this position too. As we should dominate the midfield with this setup.

[This is another view of it](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=6qx6m). The formation is a tweaked version of a diamond and would really help our creative players thrive, while also allowing our midfield to press and contribute themselves.
