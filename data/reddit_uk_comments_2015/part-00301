Hazard is the best player in the league. Willian looks like he's been training with Hazard and is playing at his best. Oscar has a full summer's rest and should avoid a midseason dip in form. Moses is a solid addition for depth on the wing. We're finally keeping some youth around, and hopefully get to see what RLC, Traore, and Kenedy can do. We also have the best manager in the world.

Make sure you use your rear light during the day. Drivers negotiate with other cars through lights (brake light, indicator light..etc). You'll be more visible. Overall read the Highway Code for cyclists (59 to 82). It tells you everything you need to, or at least should, do. 

I feel London's rush hour traffic, in the center, is really fucked up, especially near the bridges on both sides of the river (Waterloo, Vauxhall, E&amp;C..etc). Outside this area it's pretty fine to be honest. 

Acquaint yourself with cycling hand signals so that you make sure drivers understand if you're turning, swerving...etc. 

Check Sustrans for long rides/national cycle routes. 

Use Meetup.com for group rides. There are few London groups and they cycle more than once a week. Many of the national routes may involve a train ride but you can still do it from where you live in the city. 

I use Google Maps for navigation, and it's pretty good if your GPS lock is accurate. Make use of the Cycle superhighways (CS) as they give you space. Make use of London's canals. They are fun to cycle on but pay attention to pedestrians, people running...etc. 

London is a great city to cycle in, especially for exploration, given the fact that pretty much everything good will be more or less ~8 miles away from you.

null,null,istillfeelyou,rangers,,null,"Well folks like John Curtice and Steve Bruce among others have done social and historical studies on the subject of sectarianism in Scotland. Tom Devine too. These are serious and  respected historians and academics, some of them Catholic and basically they couldn't see much evidence of a sectarian society. What they did see was one divided by national identity - like the Scottish Catholic church being less than friendly to Irish Catholics because the Irish church was far more powerful. Like the initial difference in affluence, social standing, jobs and so on actually being due to the fact that Ireland was and is far more rural even now and they didn't have the skillset to immediately succeed in a growing industrialised nation like Scotland. Then there's the emancipation of Catholics which allowed them to be true citizens that only got through because the bulk of the country supported it. This was in the 17th to 19th centuries. It doesn't quite fit the accepted wisdom. The picture that emerges is a lot muddier, a lot less simple, a lot more recognisable as social issues we see today with immigrants and much less like Ireland or South Africa. We're more like Oz, Canada or America. There were schisms but the two ""worlds"" never were, they all worked and lived together. The worst Scotland has really had for a long time (since at least the 1940s) is loud mouths like you've unfortunately met, especially now. Orangefest for example...not too popular! :D That's a bit more than what I intended to write but I thought I'd clarify what I was really meaning.

That's neither here nor there and quite a vast subject. We can no doubt agree to disagree. Certainly we'd both call a bigot a bigot and deride them for those views.

Let's say it is a large problem requiring action by the legislature. That banning order doesn't deal with it, it doesn't even target extremism as a whole. You could be arrested for bigotry but wrap yourself in a flag and glorify terrorists like the IRA, UVF, PLO (whose victims or relations of victims still live today) and so on and that's fair game. Doubley so outside a football ground. What's worse is that it forces it underground and hides it out of view but it doesn't stop it at its source, or even try to. I mean when you look at the actual arrest records for a nation of 5 million it tends to undermine the law itself by showing how few arrests it really makes. True harassment is already taken care of by harassment laws I'd say I don't really think bans are effective but once again we can disagree.

To be honest per the booze it seems that for us Northerners to be an issue. Finland has very similar drinking laws and to my knowledge so does Norway. We do have a problem with the demon drink and we'll have to rally pretty hard to allow it back in the ground.

Besides, how drunk can most of us get on a fiver a pint? :D

**tl;dr Sectarianism in Scotland was never really a huge issue and problems attributed to it are really social ones relating to things like national identity, economics, education etc. Even if it was the SNP's football bill fails to deal with the problem at the source and as such is almost entirely ineffectual as well as a disproportionate and reactionary response.

I would merely say as succinct as possible that since there is a conservative majority, in what appears to be a neo-liberal hegemony in mainstream politics; that it makes sense that the disenfranchised opponents would assemble together and be desperate for answers or a path forward.

Jeremy Corbyn might not be it. He certainly has many flaws though he is as close to a candidate that encapsulate my beliefs in socialism, though I am not a labour party member nor am I sure if I would vote for him if I was. But amongst the young, middle class supporters of socialism it makes the most sense for them to gravitate online since that is where they feel they are understood. We all seek acceptance in our beliefs, with only a few of us willing to engage the other side or try to understand them. This sadly demonstrated the weakness of the modern left; it was all happening online. 

Everyone online was apparently voting labour, everyone wanted more socialism. But the trouble is we are pretty elitist on here. We are the few who signed up to Reddit, the few who commented. When the average voter is as we all know by that very famous Churchhill quote that I will summarise wrongly as 'acting like a bunch of idiots'. I am firmly in the belief that people are not actually stupid, just not well informed. That if the sort of debates that went on online were to go on in the spheres of average voters they would change their mind and vote different. The trouble is as I said, mainstream media and politics doesn't. So the general public believe there are no other options. 

After the defeat it seems like the left has retreated back online. Unfortunately for you it seems that this will mean that for the next five years will have an online hegemony of leftist views. I hope Corbyn wins, as you should too. Because I feel that he is probably the only candidate who will drag the debate to the left in the mainstream, and as such encourage left wing people online to get into the real world, leaving this sub a more balanced place.

Besides if we didn't have politics discussions every post would probably end up being about the weather and mild annoyances and we have /r/britishproblems for that.

null,null,cosmicmeander,null,null,null,"&gt;I havenât been closely following developments in UK politics since the election, but people have been asking me to comment on the emergence of Jeremy Corbyn as a serious contender for Labour leadership. And I do have a few thoughts.

&gt;First, itâs really important to understand that the austerity policies of the current government are not, as much of the British press portrays them, the only responsible answer to a fiscal crisis. There is no fiscal crisis, except in the imagination of Britainâs Very Serious People; the policies had large costs; the economic upturn when the UK fiscal tightening was put on hold does not justify the previous costs. More than that, the whole austerian ideology is based on fantasy economics, while itâs actually the anti-austerians who are basing their views on the best evidence from modern macroeconomic theory and evidence.

&gt;Nonetheless, all the contenders for Labour leadership other than Mr. Corbyn have chosen to accept the austerian ideology in full, including accepting false claims that Labour was fiscally irresponsible and that this irresponsibility caused the crisis. As Simon Wren-Lewis says, when Labour supporters reject this move, they arenât âmoving leftâ, theyâre refusing to follow a party elite that has decided to move sharply to the right.

&gt;Whatâs been going on within Labour reminds me of what went on within the Democratic Party under Reagan and again for a while under Bush: many leading figures in the party fell into what Josh Marshall used to call the âcringeâ, basically accepting the rightâs worldview but trying to win office by being a bit milder. There was a Stamaty cartoon during the Reagan years that, as I remember it, showed Democrats laying out their platform: big military spending, tax cuts for the rich, benefit cuts for the poor. âBut how does that make you different from Republicans?â âCompassion â we care about the victims of our policies.â

&gt;I donât fully understand the apparent moral collapse of New Labour after an election that was not, if you look at the numbers, actually an overwhelming public endorsement of the Tories. But should we really be surprised if many Labour supporters still believe in what their party used to stand for, and are unwilling to support the Cringe Caucus in its flight to the right?

null,null,Red1123,null,null,null,"Well this is all a bit rich from Peter Hitchens, a staunch conservative with the same anti public sector ideals as the ruling conservative government. 

The most obvious reason for the reduction in visible policing is the reduced numbers. There's less Police officers on the street than there was 10 years ago, it's that simple.

Secondly, the 'Crime Recording Standard' is killing policing, the paperwork involved in policing now is probably 10 times the amount it used to be even back in 1990. When I first started my tutor showed me one of the first crime sheets he ever put in the system, it was for a Theft by Housebreaking, and it was 1 paragraph long. 

Nowadays, a crime sheet for Theft HB will be like a short book, it'll take an hour to type. Is the victim elderly? Well I better spend another 25 minutes putting on a Vulnerable Persons Report. 

Calls that used to take an hour in total to deal with in 1990, now take 3 hours of overall work. The service is strangled by paperwork, the need for a paper trail of everything, transparency, accountability, and bureaucracy. You must remember none of those things existed in the olden days. 

Half the time in the olden days, such was discretion and the lack of oversight, that cops would just deal with stuff, but never log it anywhere. That can't happen anymore.

This isn't an argument, you're just name calling.

&gt; The most obvious reason for the reduction in visible policing is the reduced numbers. There's less Police officers on the street than there was 10 years ago, it's that simple.
&gt; 

There are more police officers in real terms and per capita than in the 60s. We had similar issues with policing 10 years ago. Hitchens' book where he first put forward this argument (A Brief History of Crime) was released in 2003. In 2006/2007, 40% of the public said they never saw the police on patrol. Now that funding has decreased, police patrols seem to have become slightly more visible, with that figure going down to 25% in 2011. http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/18/survey-never-see-police-patrol

The problem is not funding, it is a change in policy and behaviour.

&gt;Secondly, the paperwork involved in policing now is probably 10 times the amount it used to be even back in 1990.

No.  There can't be a trial.  This isn't how the law works in this area.  When it comes to interpreting a UN resolution mandating the use of force, the Attorney General is judge and jury.  Once he decides, that's it.  No court, no appeal, no judicial review.  He says it is legal, it's legal.  I mean, you can believe what you like, but it doesn't change the reality that once he decided it was legal, that was it.

Obviously regime change was politically convenient, but the simple fact is the aims of the resolution would be unlikely to be achieved without deposing Saddam.  So arguing over whether or not it should have been an aim is a bit semantic, to be honest. 

As for dodgy dossiers and the rest, I agree the intelligence could have been much more intelligently interpreted - but it is worth remembering that Saddam genuinely believed he had WMDs.  His own people lied to him so it is not unreasonable that the West believed it too.",null,0,null,1438784543,null,null,false,0,ctsbfki,null,t3_3fthzj,null,null,null,t1_ctsb46i,null,null,null,1440295317,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Listen, every player does shit like this, especially in the spanish league where the refereeing is so bad that players are even more prone to. Our loved Verts has done it (fallen with no contact as well as hitting someone - i can only remember the gaston ramirez one), Bale would fall down as well etc. What started this was me challenging your claim that the player is -Vile- and as an argument you tell me that he is vile because he was stomped in the balls... and that he ""elbowed"" a player in some of the most controversial, most agressive and worst refereed matches/league in recent years. Its like saying that Shawcross is vile because he went in late on a player and broke his leg in two even though he had no intention to do it. Its a sport, shit happens, doenst mean he has a vile character. Wanna see vile, search Ben Thatcher or Joey Barton, those are vile players completely fucked in the head.

null,null,zedest,null,null,null,"&gt; That implies that inequality is ALWAYS a bad thing. It suggests that people who are poor (those lacking property) are poor through no fault of their own, which is very often not the case. Of course I accept that there are many people who live in unfortunate circumstances due to forces outside of their control, and this is why we need at least some sort of welfare state. However, welfare should be a safety net, not a charity for those who make bad life decisions. Unfortunately, it would be very difficult to distinguish between the ""deserving"" poor and ""undeserving"" poor, and so we have the system we have at the minute currently.

I agree, but more people are falling through the cracks in the safety net than people unjustly benefiting from it. Can we not agree that to run a successful welfare state, everyone should get enough money to pay for food shelter and warmth? Because surely EVERYONE deserves that. That should be the priority in the one of the richest countries in the world.

&gt; The passage you quoted also suggests that a government that served no other purpose than to protect property rights only protects the rich, when in actual fact it protects the poor as well.  It prevents the rich abusing their power/wealth to steal from the poor.

It could mean that, but it doesn't does it? The poorest and most vulnerable in society are the ones suffering the worst cuts, as for many of them they relied on the money just to be able to live. The poorest and most vulnerable shouldn't be choosing between heat and food in winter while the riches get a tax break. Now I'm not saying that this is the free markets fault, it's the governments, but surely you must start to see why an unregulated market and corrupt self serving government aren't working.

&gt;One of the biggest criticisms of our current systems is the amount of tax avoidance that goes unpunished. People on the left suggest we raise taxes, and clamp down on businesses that avoid parting with their money. But nobody says how this can be practically achieved.

Well for a start the same big 4 accountancy firms shouldn't be able to help write government tax legislation and then go back to their big multi billionaire clients and tell them how to avoid tax through loopholes in legislation they helped write. 

&gt;My point is that a government that only protects property right, protects everyone, albeit not equally. By contrast, a government which taxes the rich harshly, does affect the rich at all, and hits the middle of society the hardest. 
Well as stated above, I'm not sure how austerity that hits the poorest the worst, and effects the people at the top the least, while people less effected get tax breaks isn't balancing the scales in favor of the rich.

&gt; Well, yes - the state is required to maintain security and public health, allowing the ""market"" to operate. It is not required for trade or business. It is not required to regulate the money supply or the interest rates. By saying the state is required for the market to operate is like saying the state is required for you to go to cinema - sure, the state needs to maintain order to you can enjoy the time you have for recreation, but it is not required for the actual act.

I don't really understand what you are saying. The free market needs the state to run, the government need the people to be happy, logic would say the government should be able to regulate the market in a way that can provide a well funded welfare state.

Like I really don't understand, who do you want these people to answer to with no government regulation?

&gt;The private sector. If you privatise something, the private sector pays for it, the private individual buys it. Unless you are referring to the so called ""privatisation"" of the NHS, which isn't privatisation at all. It's called outsourcing. While the NHS remains free at the point of delivery, paid for from public funds, it has NOT been privatised. It doesn't matter if the health care is provided by a private company - that is not what privatisation means if the money to pay for it is coming from the state. 

I'm not an expert, but I'm fairly sure that outsourcing staff from public to private sector in certain departments will lead to a race to the bottom of quality of service. How long do yo honestly foresee us having a free well run NHS?

&gt;I don't see how the NHS contributes to a healthy economy, unless you mean it helps keep the workforce healthy, and therefore productive. If the latter argument is the case, I agree with you. We need an NHS. It is the most efficient way of providing citizens with health care, when in the right hands. However, my point in the my comment above was not that the NHS is bad. I was trying to show you how we don't live in a ""free market capitalist society"". The NHS is government intervention. The government is intervening in the health care market. It isn't a capitalist organisation because it is paid for from tax payer funds. The government does not respect property rights when taxing people, therefore we are not capitalist. I'm not saying taxation is bad - I'm saying we don't need more of it. 

That is what I meant. But I still don't understand your logic, yes the NHS was government involvement, but when the âfree marketâ needs something to survive, it becomes part of the free market system. And as you said the free market needs a healthy work force, among other things. You can't simply say âit's not a free market because of government involvement regarding things that make the whole system viable lol. How can you not see the tax justification on the rich, to pay to support a system in which they created their wealth? A government should be able to demand a certain amount of money, in which they make sure they get, use it to pay for a full proof welfare state, and have important services in national ownership, in order to make sure they are run correctly in order to benefit the country, and if they don't, the government have someone to answer to, unlike now where the private sector can do whatever the hell it wants without anybody to answer too, like the 2008 crisis.

&gt;Why? Why, why why why? Why does the free market need to be regulated? Because it perpetuates inequality? You don't know that for sure, because we don't live in a free market society. We have had over a hundred years of a welfare state in this country and poverty has not been eradicated. There are still poor people in Germany, despite your willingness to champion there economic ideals.


Firstly I only really referred to the Germans because their economy is so successful, I'm not saying they don't have poor people, but they have a successful economy that of which also serves the need of saving the planet. But I think it's fairly obvious that when you have a conservative government implementing austerity and lowering the living standards drastically for the people at the bottom of society, paying for a debt caused by the unregulated free market, they should have more than a basis for an argument to have that same market regulated.

Unregulated banks = Financial crash
unregulated energy companies = no planet

In that case, it'll be Young on the left. 

Rojo also hasn't played all preseason, I think, due to have an extended holiday after the Copa America, so I'm not sure he'll start. Van Gaal seems to prefer a left footed center back as the left side of the pair.

null,null,Lou3000,flair1,,null,"When I think about Bentaleb being thrown into the side by Sherwood, he was often out of his depth against bigger clubs.  The talent was obvious, and he was very composed for a 19 year old, but it is a tall order even if you are the next superstar midfielder.  Alli feels the same way.  Way more composed than your average 19 year old, but I'm not sure putting him in against Man U is a smart way to find out how composed he can be.  

Additionally, from a tactical perspective, Alli obviously gets forward.  His preseason play and his history at MK Dons show that he can and will get forward to score.  This creates a bit of an issue when Bentaleb is playing beside him.  Mason plays a lot different.  He tends to pick out a long pass, and then get forward when we have possession in the final third.  Alli moves forward with the attack and often moves the ball forward himself (a bit like Dembele).  I don't think it was coincidental that he played along Dier yesterday.  I'm not sure how defensive he can be.  

I sort of feel like no one is going to be surprised if we lose to Man U this weekend.  I hate that, but we obviously aren't done in the transfer window, and we are in Germany two days before the match.  So with Mason's match fitness a question, maybe now's as good a time as any to test Alli, but I'm not saying he'll do better.

I also suggest that ""could have been intelligently interpreted"" is one way of phrasing it. ""Lying to parliament"" is another, and that could be the basis of a potential court case were there the will for it.

Furthermore, I don't agree that ""arguing over whether or not it should have been an aim is a bit semantic,"" because if, after trawling through communications between Blair and Bush there turned out to be clear evidence of collusion on the basis of regime change, that would potentially form the basis for a prosecution.

Finally, some countries allow war crimes tribunals to be held for non-citizens. These could also allow people like Tony Blair to be on trail if there turned out to be the will for it.

It's pretty clear there isn't any will for this amongst our political classes, I agree. But to say there's no mechanism where it could conceivably happen is, I think, incorrect. In fact one of the problems of the Iraq war, even after such a long time, is that a large enough number of people believe the war to be illegitimate that it keeps rumbling on. It's not likely to go to a trial, but exactly because of that I doubt it'll ever be a settled issue either.

My own view, admittedly as a non-lawyer, is that the war was illegal, that this illegality was covered up for political reasons, that the evidence was manufactured, and that the fact this was possible diminishes our democracy terribly.

First of all the two main questions in Cruddas' piece:

1) we must live within our means so cutting the deficit is the top priority

2) [I] would be very concerned if the SNP were ever in government

Cruddas has taken the results from these (extremely loaded) questions and decided that the public does not want to see the end of austerity. So the Graun is taking this further (to what it doubtless believes is a logical conclusion) to say that this survey shows that Corbyn and his policies are not wanted by the general public.

Cruddas' conclusions are hopelessly subjective given the overall context, and the Guardian has picked these up as another of their anti-Corbyn articles.

Had question 1 been carved up into two parts (""We must live within our means"" being separate to ""cutting the deficit is the top priority"") the results could (and probably would) have been very different. I could have asked ""the sky is green so cutting the deficit is the top priority"" and I would have got high agreement because people see the word ""deficit"" and it overrides everything else.",null,0,null,1438786279,null,null,false,0,ctschrs,null,t3_3fvk80,null,null,null,t3_3fvk80,null,null,null,1440295817,null,6,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,6,null

There's a huge element of Liverpool fans that is automatically nostalgic, due to the history of the club, and those fans can sometimes go a bit overboard. ""Hur hur hur Chelsea don't have any history"" and such stuff. And those fans tend to be the ones who people base us on.

But if you look at players, pundits, managers in the game now, Liverpool are still a hugely respected club. Our name brings players in, maybe not as much as it used to, but you hear players around today still saying ""I couldn't wait to play at Anfield"".

Dress. Wear a suit. Doesn't have to be a posh one, but it has to be obvious that you've made an effort.

If you're male; Wear a tie and remove jewellery. It is grossly unfair, but I once had a guy fail to get a job he was perfect for because he wore an earring and one guy on the panel didn't like it. Don't risk it, take them out.

Ladies? Forget anything that emphasises your cleavage or has too high a hem. If there's a lady on.the panel she'll see through it, and men will forget your answers and just remember your cleavage. Yes this is a crass generalisation, but again, I've sat on a panel and seen it happen. Modesty isn't a bad thing and Marks sells a blouse with extra hidden buttons. You only need one. 

Wear a watch. No, not the plastic Mickey Mouse one (yes, someone did), but any cheapo watch will do and it says ""I can tell the time"".

Know your CV. If the interviewer asks you about a specific experience, it's best not to sit there looking confused, or they'll think it's a fictional work.

Accept water or don't, base it on whether you'll drink it, trust me, they don't care.

Clean your teeth, brush your hair, shower, use deodorant... I'm sure you lot don't need telling, but again, I've been there, and some people really do!

Shake hands, make eye.contact and remember that you can totally do this job. Don't be overly confident, but don't get so panicked you lose the ability to breathe. Luckily, I wasn't the first aider and just phoned the ambulance for that one.

If they ask you a question that you can't think of an answer to straight away, be honest, say you're nervous and could you come back to that one.

null,null,u38cg,null,null,null,"&gt; I don't agree that the opinion of the lawyers of a particular country is the important factor in international law.

It depends on what, exactly, the law in the case in question is.  In the case of the Iraq war, the law is that the government's legal adviser must sign off on the legality.  He did and so it was legal.  In the case of Nuremberg, the whole thing was entirely extra-legal.  The tribunals had no real legal basis; they were simply justice dished out by the victors - not that it wasn't well deserved.

&gt; ""could have been intelligently interpreted"" is one way of phrasing it. ""Lying to parliament"" is another

I meant lower down in the security apparatus.  There is no evidence anyone deliberately lied to Parliament - not that doing so is illegal, and indeed it is necessary at times.

&gt; some countries allow war crimes tribunals to be held for non-citizens.

Many do, including the UK.  There still has to be something to try, and since the war was not illegal it can't go very far, as the various people who have tried to carry out citizen's arrests and launch private prosecutions have learnt.

&gt; to say there's no mechanism where it could conceivably happen is, I think, incorrect

Again it's not about what people think.  If you think there is a route in law to charging Blair (or anyone else) with something, anything, you're simply wrong.  There is not one.  

&gt; a large enough number of people believe the war to be illegitimate that it keeps rumbling on.

Yes, and it's largely because people keep repeating misinformation.  I quite understand people thinking the Iraq war was the biggest debacle since Suez, and they're welcome to that view, but they still need to keep within the bounds of reality-based debate.

Personally I haven't smoked the stuff in years and I'm not sure i would, even if it was made legal. However I'm absolutely perplexed as to why the majority of people think it's so terrible.

In recent years more and more evidence is being presented that suggest various banned substances are less harmful than mainstream legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco. But the issue is never tackled and swept under the rug by those in power. The only reason I can see for this is a fear for loss of political reputation.

Benefits such as tax revenue, quality control and regulation (which will more than likely reduce the number of health issues associated with uncontrolled drugs), personal freedom and the possibility of using these substances for potential health benefits. 

I really can't see what the downsides are.

null,null,IxionS3,null,null,null,"Your tax code should be on the payslip so you can tell what they've used.

One problem with multiple jobs is that your full tax allowance will generally be allocated to the first job HMRC know about; other jobs will tax everything at basic rate.  If you don't actually earn enough in your primary job to use the full allowance then you will end up overpaying.  In the long run you should get this back but it can take a while - HMRC review accounts after the tax year ends in April and give themselves until September to make refunds, so you may well still be due a refund from the 14/15 tax year, and shouldn't expect to see refunds from the current period until summer 2016.

If you are in this situation then you can ask HMRC to adjust your tax codes to split the allowance, so say if you expect to earn Â£5000 from the festival job you can ask HMRC to send them a tax code showing Â£5000 allowance and reduce the tax code for your other job.  That will help but it won't entirely eliminate the problem.

The other issue is that PAYE isn't really set up well for temporary jobs.  Your employers pretty much have to assume that you will work for the full year even if they know you won't. This is AFAIK basically impossible to work around.  

Adding a third job next term would exacerbate the issue - again you can play with tax codes to some extent but it may be impossible to avoid overpaying a certain amount of tax and waiting for it to be refunded.

You may be able to get some tax back earlier by [submitting a P50](https://www.gov.uk/claim-tax-refund/youve-stopped-work), but only if there's at least a 4 week period where you're not working at all.

It used to be possible for students to fill in a form declaring they didn't expect to earn over the threshold in the year and get paid tax free, but that hasn't been the case for some years.",null,0,null,1438788660,null,null,false,0,ctse0us,null,t3_3fvqre,null,null,null,t3_3fvqre,null,null,null,1440296538,null,8,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,8,null

That's not true, after that he also started against Aston Villa and then Stoke on 9th November. That was his last PL game for us having started the majority of the previous ones.

Ade was used as a substitute in the PL against Stoke on 9th November and had featured in 7 games since the start of October for us up until then. He didn't feature again until 17th January. I don't think he was injured or on compassionate leave but I could be wrong.

Lennon's last start was December the 3rd so you're correct about that.

Capoue was the other player who was said to have been involved in the bust up on the side of Kaboul, Ade etc. After starting 11 PL games his final one was Stoke on the 9th November.

Does that mean there was the ITK was definitely correct? No. But it does seem like more than coincidence that there was talk of these players have fought with the squad just before most of them stopped playing.

My main issues with it come from personal experiences with people who use it.  

I've seen it ruin people.  It's makes them lackluster and no fun to be around unless you want to smoke with them.  I've lost friends to pot (not in a fatal way, more an eroding of who they were) This is bad enough in itself but the knock on effects to friends and families are awful.  As is the stench.  And yes, I know you can say the same about booze and cigs, but unfortunately they are both here to stay at this point, and I can't understand the logic of ""these things are bad, why not have another bad thing too"".  The tobacco and alcohol companies have huge political power.  We have enough corporate corruption and meddling in politics as it is without WeedCo having their say too.
  
Quality control and regulation are good points, but such things cost money to implement and maintain.  Where will the money come from?  Pot sales and taxes?  Then isn't that just cycling drug money into drug regulation... where's the economic benefit?  And if there isn't enough tax revenue to run the system, will we be expected to accept service cuts elsewhere to prop up the regulatory bodies?  I don't think I would be alone in being angry about that.

The more the service costs to run, the more the product will have to cost.  You know who already has a functioning, lost cost (due to lack of regulation) supply chain and distribution network?  The existing dealers.  The scumbag criminal element.  
Pot buyers already happily hand over money to dangerous criminal gangs for their high.  The criminal element are not just going to say ""Fair cop, it's legal now. Guess we are out of business.""  They will be more cutthroat, drop prices to keep their customers and\or push harder alternatives.  People will keep using them and nothing changes. Nothing for the better anyway.

Medical use is a place where I cannot disagree with you.  If there are medical benefits, dish the stuff out medically.  By prescription.  Like most other controlled drugs.

I know a lot of this is conjecture and ""what-if"", but so are a lot of the pro-weed arguments. Criminals will go away!  Money will be abundant!

Yikes, that became a wall of text.  If you read all of this, thank you.  It's hard to be anti-pot on Reddit, it's not something I think because I am an idiot or a killjoy.

And too many parents are now dealing with the fact that their grown children cannot afford to fly the nest.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Under my âVision for Britain 2020â Labour will promote major council-funded, desirable energy efficient building projects to provide our young people with a good start in life, to stop paying exorbitant rents and the opportunity of a home they can at least call their own,"" said Jeremy Corbyn.
&gt; 
&gt; ""It has become clear that when housing provision is left purely to market forces most of our young people simply cannot afford to get a foot on the rung of the market's so called housing ladder.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""It also makes economic sense, as today's housing document outlines.""
&gt; 
&gt; âHousing has reached crisis point: families are shunted from council house to B&amp;B to hostel, hundreds of miles away from support networks and denied stability or security; council homes are emptied, regenerated and sold at prices well out of the reach of normal people, causing the social cleansing of our cities.""

[Incorrect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials#Creation_of_the_courts)

&gt; Some 200 German war crimes defendants were tried at Nuremberg, and 1,600 others were tried under the traditional channels of military justice. The legal basis for the jurisdiction of the court was that defined by the Instrument of Surrender of Germany. Political authority for Germany had been transferred to the Allied Control Council which, having sovereign power over Germany, could choose to punish violations of international law and the laws of war.

&gt; There is no evidence anyone deliberately lied to Parliament.

Possibly incorrect (who knows what evidence exists?).

&gt;  not that doing so is illegal

A fair comment, accepted.

&gt; There still has to be something to try, and since the war was not illegal it can't go very far

... this is assuming the result of an argument as part of its proof. My assertion is that the Iraq war is illegal due to international aggression being the supreme crime under Nuremberg. A trial would prove it.

&gt; If you think there is a route in law to charging Blair (or anyone else) with something, anything, you're simply wrong. There is not one.

Incorrect, as described above. Here you're just not reading my responses and answering as to how you'd like the world to be. I'm not saying there will be a war crimes trial. Just that it could be held.

&gt; Yes, and it's largely because people keep repeating misinformation.

People like Kofi Annan, presumably? Again, you're using an assertion that you are correct rather than showing it to be the case.

&gt; My own view

well if that isn't a case of Dunning-Kruger, I don't know what is.

Edit here's the way it works. I have outlined a number of mechanisms that could be used to prosecute the illegality of the Iraq war. This is fact - if the will existed, the war and its perpetrators could indeed be prosecuted.

My opinion is that the war was illegal. This is opinion. I am correct to be allowed an opinion here because the answer is not, despite your assertions, a settled subject.

Edit 2: just one example. [Look at this debate in the house of lords](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/11328177/Tony-Blair-could-face-war-crimes-charges-over-Iraq-War.html). I realise it isn't going to happen, but if the Chilcott report goes the wrong way, Blair could indeed be prosecuted.

I agree. But you can say that without a Nazi comparison.

The issue I have is Nazi comparisons, for many reasons;

The Nazis did a lot of things that perfectly reputable governments have also done; invest in public infrastructure, positive national self-promotion; things like that. You could make Nazi comparisons to these acts as well. Does that make them wrong?

Katie Hopkins is not a government. The Nazi party was. Her views are the views of a Sun Journalist. Even if she was, literally, a Nazi, it wouldn't make any difference.

Nazi comparisons are emotive. If she's saying something reprehensible, then you should be able to explain why without going for a crude emotive reason. 

The Nazis committed *actual* acts of genocide. They didn't merely talk about them.

And worst of all, it's really bad at being persuasive. There's a subtext here, intended or otherwise that Katie Hopkins is a Nazi. I don't like her much but I'm not going to go along with people who are promoting that sort of thing. Essentially, all this does is persuade people who already agree with.

I would argue that Liverpool losing their 2 top scorers and getting Milner, Benteke and Ings is a loss as well. Unless Sturridge is healthy, Spurs will definitely finish above them. Arsenal need a better striker than Giroud. United do look stronger than last year but that's not saying much. We have Sergio AgÃ¼ero, the best player in the league despite the snub he always gets come award time or what the pundits might say, David Silva who, while yes is getting older, doesn't really require physicality to play and doesn't look on the decline and is one of best in the world.
      Joe Hart, best keeper in the league, yes I can already hear ""but...but...in 2013 he made a mistake in 2 games in a row and the TV told me he was shit"" but he has been on fire lately and in my opinion was the best keeper in the world last year next to Neuer. And there's actual numbers to back that up, his golden glove as well.
      And now our new formation will support our back line much better. And we'll see a return to form for Kompany. 
       Also the transfer window isn't closed yet and we could see other big name signings coming our way.

I err on the side of defining it as a British sitcom because of the commissioning but also because to an extent it was pitched as a very surreal window to look in at rural Ireland from elsewhere (the UK).

At the time a lot of Irish people were horrified at it (and some still are, mostly older people) because of the supposed digs at the church, of which there are actually very few. Of course the same horrified people are huge fans of Mrs Browns Boys, so obviously was more to do with their own personal hang ups than the actual programme.

I think delivery plays a part. I was once called a 'dirty fenian bastard' by an english girl in a club because I came from NI, which was fine at the time because we were having some banter and she was trying to recall offensive terms.  It's ok amongst friends and family but to use it with strangers or with enemies then it's intent is to cause offense.  You can call your loyalist family members a mick but you would never consider going down to the village and calling people a mick/paddy.

I guess we just disagree, but a lot of what you said sounds sensible. Fundamentally though, I wouldn't spend any money redeveloping a nuclear weapons program, and I very much doubt we'd need one going forward.

As a last point, if you really do think state sponsored terror (against us, rather than undertaken by our allies, for a change) would result in us being hit with an ICBM or something similar, I still don't think that makes possessing nukes right. Rational actors wouldn't nuke a country whether or not that country had nukes, its a morally ridiculous, politically ruinous (on an international level) and extremely short sighted move. Irrational actors, leaders and the like, wouldn't give a shit and might just nuke us either way. If those sorts of political leaders are in power, who would nuke us not to take what we have(the way some Soviets hypothetically might have) but just to attack what we are, nuking them back would still be a BS decision. Killing that many civilians as collateral is unjustifiable, and that's my final argument against them.

null,null,bustedracquet,null,null,null,"Where do you think he ends up? I think he'll go to PSG or Bayern. 

I agree though, I think we just need more goal scoring in general to be a threat in Europe. You look at the other top teams in the world, like Barca, Bayern, and Real, and the only threats we have to score goals are Hazard and Costa, otherwise we are reliant on set pieces. Costa has serious hamstring issues, that make me wonder whether long-term he'll actually be our striker, and Hazard is always marked heavily out of games when Costa is not there. The only way I see that problem being resolved is if Oscar takes that next step and becomes world class, and gives us more goals and creates more chances for the rest of the team. 

More than Griezmann though (and I badly wanted him), I really wanted another midfielder to pair with Matic in the big games. You know Jose is going to push Fabregas farther forward in big games, and drop Oscar for either Mikel/Ramires. Somebody physical, committed defensively, good with the ball, and can ping a pass anywhere on the pitch would be ideal, and the guy who I really wanted who could be that was Morgan Schneiderlin, plus the lad counts as homegrown! Would've been the perfect summer transfer for me IMO. Witsel wouldn't have been bad either. 

Alas though, neither of those guys would come here and be a non-guaranteed starter. It's really frustrating how hard it is to find players who are quality enough to play in the 10-15 big games for us a year when Jose drops Oscar, yet is content to be on the bench for almost all the other games.

They will be subject to the same philosophy, the same training methods, and will be working towards clearer goals than they would if they or their manager knew that a change in leadership was in the near future.

When new managers are brought in, they re-evaluate the worth of youth prospects. The new standings could see players whom the old manager rated highly, not considered in the plans of the new coach. This could be part of whats lead to players having four or five loan spells. It could be that players that Mou gave the first loan spells to, with the intention of bringing them into the first team in the future, were not rated by AVB or Ancolotti etc. and ended up going out on more loans just to get them off the books or increase their sale value.

Now, however, Mou can completely oversee a payers development from the academy to the first team which, hopefully, will end up with a much clearer and easily traversable route to the first team for our youth/prospect players.",null,0,null,1438791144,null,null,1438791339,0,ctsfp6x,null,t3_3fvq1l,null,null,null,t3_3fvq1l,null,null,null,1440297392,null,3,null,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3,null

The Orange Order and what it celebrates is inherently sectarian and supremacist. It celebrates the imposition of colonial rule and glorifies Catholic oppression in Ireland.

The 1916 rising was egalitarian in nature and sought to liberate Ireland. It also failed. It's a bitter memory for Ireland, but was one of the most important events in modern Irish history, and so should be marked. 

The events themselves and the commemorations are at opposite ends of the spectrum morally. One celebrates oppression and triumphalism, the other commemorates liberation and loss. 

Any similarities are entirely superficial (oooh fancy costumes), and the points of comparison (not inclusive, the outfits, etc.) have nothing to do with the problems Catholics/nationalists have with the OO. What matters is the tone of the events (triumphalist vs. somber), and what they represent (oppression and colonialism vs. liberation).

Walker - Alderwiereld - Vertoghen - Rose

Carroll - Bentaleb - Alli

Eriksen - Kane - Chadli

Vorm - depends on Lloris' wrist. I would not want to risk further injury by putting him on the pitch prematurely. That injury needs to be 100% before any serious play. We need Lloris for our whole season.

The back four are easily our strongest combination currently - I'm a huge fan of both Yedlin and Tripier but Walker was outstanding vs Real Madrid. Wimmer looks excellent but Vert and Toby already have an established partnership.

Switching to a 4-3-3 to not only throw off our opponents who will be well drilled to counter Kane and our 4-2-3-1 we never change, but also to close up the holes we often leave and to give our offense a mix up, hopefully leading to more chances we wouldn't usually create.

Bentaleb is the best suited for holding midfielder and is really starting to shine with long balls. Carroll and Alli are both capable of supporting our front line incredibly well, while also insuring forward momentum and strong possession. This also has the added bonus of not needing Lamela, Townsend or some other equally lackluster right winger on the field. 

Eriksen, Kane and Chadli are our most prolific scorers so it's a no brainer to have them play the forward 3. Both Eriksen and Chadli can crack open defenses and provide Kane with abundant opportunities and the 4-3-3 will allow Kane to stay forward and not have to come so deep to collect the ball constantly. 

This setup would also allow less pressure to be on Kane as our only goal outlet and in fact probably help Soldado incredibly if we need to play him.

The lads know what to do. I'd leave the speeches until half time. Just constantly press and run them ragged. Lets cause an upset.

And some times I forget which is from actual material and what I made up in my head from my Grand-Master-Head-Canon-Plan.**BUT**I'll try give a brief rundown of the interesting bits that don't completely not make sense. The Doctor was born in the House of Lungbarrow (or Loomed, but we will gloss over that for now) and the Master was born in the House of Oakdown. Both these Houses were aligned under the Pyrdonian Chapter. The Master's original name was Koschei, or at least he was commonly known as that, and the Doctor came to be known as Theta Sigma when they were at the Time Lord Academy. The Doctor lived in a house on the side of a mountain and had a brother, Braxiatel (and maybe a Time Lord father (Ulysses) and a human mother (Penelope Gate) but it's complicated so we will just gloss over it) The Doctor would occasionally visit a hermit that lived hear the summit. And then he lived out on a farm, or some sort of place, and would often hide in the barn at night.When the Doctor and the Master were young, they were close friends. They would play on the Master's father's estate, and go out drinking with the Shobogons, which lead to some interesting encounters.Both the Doctor and the Master had to face the Untempered Schism. The Doctor is said to have run away at the raw power of time and space, and the Master went mad as Rassilon sent the heart-beat signal back in time to that moment. At the Academy, the Doctor and the Master were both bullied mercilessly bullied by another student. It got so bad that the Doctor was forced to kill the bully. At that moment, Death herself appeared to the Doctor and asked him to become her champion. The Doctor refused but instead offered up the Master, who Death accepted. The Doctor and the Master were members of a clique of friends at the academy called the Deca. Other friends included the War Chief (Magnus) and the Rani (Ushas) (and maybe the Monk (Mortimus), Drax, Jelpax, and Millenia but I'm not sure if I made that up or not). The Doctor graduated from the Academy with a mark if 51% in the final exam. Maybe. What he, and the Master, did in the years between then and leaving Gallifrey is a little unclear, and can be confusing so it might be better just to check out the TARDIS Data Core wiki. Hope that helps.",null,0,null,1438792183,null,null,false,0,ctsgerl,null,t3_3fvd4c,null,null,null,t1_ctsaal5,null,null,null,1440297726,null,8,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8,null

He didn't play for well over 2 months after that game and (according to ESPN) he got just 60 minutes of PL football after that game.

Sure, maybe after the same game Poch decided purely for footballing reasons that none of them were good enough to get significant minutes again but it seems unlikely. Kaboul didn't suddenly get worse in the games leading up to his disappearance, neither did Capoue. 

I don't believe for a second that Soldado locked down the back up striker role based on his performances alone. Maybe Ade had a personal problem but the club has generally told us when that has been the case and I don't recall them doing so this time.

null,null,nrolo24,null,null,null,"I know its a tricky mine field criticizing Bentaleb on this sub. And truthfully I think he and Mason make up our best midfield.

However, Bentaleb is a very good young player who people seem to believe is a defensive minded partner away from being a goal scoring assist getting machine. The first half of last season Mason was the only spark we had causing problems in the midfield and actually getting forward.

Bentaleb to me always plays great but no real signs that he is already consistently a box-to-box CM who can provide goals and creativity enough to take apart strong midfield. 

Mason is not a Champions league CM. This is his biggest fault. But he is a very good PL midfielder. Who does cause issue for opposing midfielders in attack. 

Based on this I could see a scenario where Poch drops Bentaleb for Alli in a game. Because Alli is showing he can be box-to-box. With the ability to get forward and be creative. And I know the knock people give is relax it has been two pre-season games. But do not forget he has far more professional experience than Bentaleb. Even if at a lower level. 

I see Alli as further along in development then Bentaleb. Is he better? Unsure because haven't seen him in premier league actually. But he has been through a promotion fight and been a leader on a team. Things Bentaleb has never had to do.

I just see Mason and Alli as better getting forward. And if our wingers are going to play as poorly as they have. We need as much attack as possible.

Alli and Bentaleb will eventually be our midfield this season. But I think a solid rotation of the three will be the best case scenario.

Is there a rule that says I can't take issue with a single aspect of an article without tackling the whole?

The executions would not have happened without the Rising. When the leaders went ahead with it after the setbacks they did not expect the Rising itself to achieve independence. Pearse talked a load of suicidal nonsense about blood sacrifice but in the end it had an effect.

It is also too much of a generalisation to say that it was seen in that way by Dubliners. Some may have seen it that way but I would say far more were incensed by the destruction wrought by artillery  in the city centre and the killing of civilians as a result of the Rising.

I also wouldn't place the Rising as the moment when partition became an inevitability. I would place that at the point around 1918/19 when the leadership of the labour movement decided to let Sinn FÃ©in lead the independence movement and set the narrative as a purely nationalist one. 

Working class militancy in Belfast was near at its height in 1919 and weary of the war like much of Europe. A protestant socialist vocally in favour of an Irish workers republic polled impressively in council elections in Shankill. Had Labour taken the initiative rather than place second fiddle to the Shinners and appealed for an independence movement based on class lines rather than national ones we might have seen some very different events play out. Indeed the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland explicitly changed their tactics of repression against Sinn FÃ©in in response to the Belfast strikes in 1919 to encourage this nationalist narrative to stop something more alarming to the ruling class growing in ulster.",null,0,null,1438792461,null,null,false,0,ctsglse,null,t3_3fus1u,null,null,null,t1_ctsfa7b,null,null,null,1440297819,null,2,null,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2,null

I mean, he's got a decent idea here which is to embark on a huge council funded building of affordable homes. That, is a good idea. 

But then he's just needlessly thrown in some pointless populist policies in the form of rent control. 

If you're building enough houses, then rent control isn't needed. You'll increase the supply, and bring down the price. There's just no need to kick Landlords like that. 

I'm not their biggest fans, but I don't want to see them bankrupted. It won't be the slumlords that get hurt by these policies, as they'll just ignore the various laws anyway as they do now. 

Increase supply, and let that put a downward pressure on house prices and rent. 

I'm not really sure if he's advocating council housing (as in you rent from the council, and the council always owns the house) or affordable housing (non-profit house building). 

I don't think we should return to actual council housing. I think people should be encouraged to eventually own the homes they're paying rent to the council on. I think it would encourage a sense of collective responsibility for the areas that these houses are built in and stop them turning into shitholes like a lot of council estates have in the past. I'd say evidence for this would be the many council estates which are almost entirely privately owned. They're generally much nicer places than they were when they were only council tenants. 

This could be done by a form of 'council equity' where 30% (or something more calculated) of your rent each month is saved and counts towards equity in the property. The other 70% goes to the council for repairs and the loan they took to build the place. If people know they own 5% of a home, or whatever, they're more likely to care about it.

Back then, the only teams you could see on Tele were the top 4 -- Pool, Gooners, Man Utd and Chelski. (this is before Man City got Arab Money and were shit). This is kind of why there are so many bandwagon/glory hunter yank fans (in addition to just being glory hunting cunts)

I used to ""follow"" Arsenal and Liverpool because that was all that was on. I really liked Steve G (bin dipping cunt). But fell in love with the Hammers watching the FA Cup final (ironic, seeing as we lost in horrible fucking fashion). From there it was watching Carlos Tevez on horrible internet streams at 5am (bandwidth wasn't as prevalent back then either).

From there I've learned to love the club, especially the supporters. The fanbase is top knotch, no matter if the club is relegated or doing well. They're always behind the lads. Something I couldn't find with the top clubs, especially chelsea which the bridge environment is like going to Church zzzz...and Man Utd draws in more crowds for their london aways with londoners and foreign fans. 

Yes, I'll admit i have a slight holier than thou complex about the hammers, but I would rather not be one of the many and be shoulder to shoulder with bandwagoning americans, but in stead one of the few... When I do find fellow hammers fans, I know they feel mostly the same, or they have some history that links them to England.

We did not have justification to go to war. The government failed to get their justification from the UN and then went to war anyway. The notion of going to war in Iraq had infact been floated long before the justifications had been found, as proven by the Project for the New American Century and various memos and minutes discussing the viability of an attack on Iraq long before 2001.

Blair pulled us into that war based on a pack of lies. There were no weapons of mass destruction. There was no link to Al Qaeda.

null,null,calculusprime,null,null,null,"&gt; The Orange Order and what it celebrates is inherently sectarian and supremacist. It celebrates the imposition of colonial rule and glorifies Catholic oppression in Ireland.
&gt; 
&gt; The 1916 rising was egalitarian in nature and sought to liberate Ireland. It also failed. It's a bitter memory for Ireland, but was one of the most important events in modern Irish history, and so should be marked.
&gt; 
&gt; The events themselves and the commemorations are at opposite ends of the spectrum morally. One celebrates oppression and triumphalism, the other commemorates liberation and loss. 

Hmmm... Any possibility that's YOUR reading of what both sets of commemorations represent?

i.e. that's a subjective account of your opinion rather than an objective statement of fact.

I'm not sure many orangemen believe they're celebrating catholic oppression.

And quite a lot of people could put a strong argument that the 1916 rising led to nothing but a failure of ultimate objectives and a century of bloodshed and division. 

And that's kind of the point. Its the very nature of history - all of this stuff is highly open to projection by whichever individual is doing the interpreting, and whatever baggage they're carrying at that time, or point they're desperate to prove.

One's man's ""commemoration of the liberation of Ireland"" is another man's ""commemoration of a century of killing unarmed police officers and post hoc calling it liberation heroism"".

One man's ""march to celebrate oppression"" is another man's ""march to celebrate his civil and religious liberty""

Indeed, the fact that you're using your response to her article to dig up tired lines of ""British colonial rule in Ireland"" rather suggests the writer has a point. 1916 will quite likely be shamelessly used by many to whip up anti-British sentiment on the basis of loaded interpretation of events conducted long ago by people long dead and that happened to other people long dead.

null,null,BullshitSuperMan,null,null,null,"&gt;but surely you must start to see why an unregulated market and corrupt self serving government aren't working

Of course I do! This is what this whole argument is about. I am advocating an unregulated free market while you are arguing for government to control all means of production. The two together won't work and will never work.  
People often talk about ""the 1%"" and how it is ludicrously unfair that ""the 1%"" own so much of the wealth. People forgot, of course, that ""the 1%"" pay almost a quarter of the income tax in this country. They subsidise our schools and hospitals. They already pay a high level of tax. As a result, governments' become reliant on these rich people to keep their wealth in this country, so they can continue to collect tax revenue from them. This is what creates corruption in the system. Politicians are bound by the wishes' of the rich to keep the rich happy, because we rely on the rich for a welfare state. Socialism doesn't reduce poverty because it is in the corrupt politicians' interests' to keep the poor in poverty. It is all they can campaign on. And if Corbyn is elected leader of the Labour party, he won't take the problem of poverty seriously, because while there is poverty, he has a platform to get elected on.  

&gt;Well for a start the same big 4 accountancy firms shouldn't be able to help write government tax legislation and then go back to their big multi billionaire clients and tell them how to avoid tax through loopholes in legislation they helped write.

I was not referring to tax loopholes within the UK tax system. I was referring to tax avoidance by moving your money offshore. If company doesn't like the rate of corporation tax, they can just get up and leave, taking all their tax revenue and jobs with them.  

&gt;I don't really understand what you are saying. The free market needs the state to run, the government need the people to be happy, logic would say the government should be able to regulate the market in a way that can provide a well funded welfare state.

If I go down to the river and catch a fish, I have a fish I can sell. I sell you that fish at a market stall in town. Where in that scenario does the government come in? And I mean in the actual transaction? In that scenario, the only roles the government needs to play are to protect the town from being invaded, to protect my property right over the fish and to protect you (the consumer) to ensure I am not selling you potentially harmful food.  

&gt;I'm not an expert, but I'm fairly sure that outsourcing staff from public to private sector in certain departments will lead to a race to the bottom of quality of service. How long do yo honestly foresee us having a free well run NHS?

No, surly the opposite would happen. Private firms would compete against each other to provide health services, that meet a set standard of quality, at the lowest possible prices. It will ultimately help to drive the cost to tax payer down. They would not compete against each other to provide the worst quality of service. That logic is stupid. The problem is, those on the left feel that it is ""unethical"" to make private profit out the NHS, and that is why we should not continue trying to get the lowest possible prices. They would rather pay more for their health care than have some of the money to firms and corporations. However, in applying this reality detached logic, they forgot we are currently already spend more that 2 billion pounds a week on healthcare - and that money isn't disappearing in to thin air. Somebody - some private individuals - are already making huge, huge sums off the NHS.  They must be. Otherwise, where is all the money going? These private individuals though, are hard working, dedicated, public sector doctors and nurses that can do no wrong - yet they are the ones who are bleeding the system dry.  

&gt;but when the âfree marketâ needs something to survive, it becomes part of the free market system

The free market doesn't NEED the NHS. We could live in a world with a free market system without an NHS for sure. My point was that the NHS is the most effective way to provide citizens with healthcare, and it ensures that everyone in the workforce remains healthy.  

&gt;You can't simply say âit's not a free market because of government involvement regarding things that make the whole system viable lol.

Yes, I can, actually. Government involvement is the exact opposite of free market. There is no free market in healthcare, because no private healthcare institution can compete with a service which is costless. And this is part of my wider argument in these comments, which is: we do not live in a free market capitalist society! The state has so, so, so much power over the economy, which makes blaming the free market for the 2007/8 financial crash difficult, because we do not live in a free market!  

&gt; How can you not see the tax justification on the rich, to pay to support a system in which they created their wealth?

Well, how much higher than 45% for the top earners do you really want to go? 50%? 75%? 90%? How much of their money do you want? How much innovation do you want to inhibit because people are dissuaded from starting companies due to heavy, punishing taxes? How much of a person's wealth is society responcible for, and how much of it is down to the merits of the person who acquired such an amount of wealth?  

&gt;have important services in national ownership, in order to make sure they are run correctly

So, unless a service is in national ownership, it won't be run correctly? Thousands of people use private healthcare in this country - it seems like that service is run pretty well. Also, how do you determine when a service is run correctly? Take transport, for example. If we do end up privatising the railways as Corbyn so desperately wants to - what looks like correct operation for the rail service? Who determines the regularity of trains? How do we ensure services in public ownership are run correctly, when no one can agree on what ""correctly"" looks like. In a free market, you vote with your cash. You like the service of one supermarket over another? You use the supermarket with the better service. I don't need the state to tell where the best place is to do my weekly shop!  

&gt;in order to benefit the country

Again, this is subjective.  

&gt;private sector can do whatever the hell it wants without anybody to answer too

The private sector have their customers to answer to. See the supermarket analogy above - you don't like Tesco's service, you shop at Asda. Simple as. True, the private sector can do whatever it likes, but good luck to any company that pisses off their consumer.  

&gt;like the 2008 crisis

The banks knew they could do whatever the hell they liked because the knew the government would bail them out. Again, I have to stress the fact that we do not live in a free market economy! Would the banks have been as reckless if they thought that they would be left to wither and die, when the whole system collapsed? Of course they would not have been that reckless! They would have acted more responsibly. YES - the private sector caused the collapse. YES - the government bailed them out.

If a driver had done all they can within reason to prevent someone accessing their vehicle, then of course they should be okay to carry on without any fine.  From what I've read, that's also the line the police are taking.

But if the driver knew, or didn't do anything to prevent it and then used ""I didn't know"" as an excuse, then why shouldn't they face a fine? Ignorance of the law isn't an excuse for the rest of us, so why should it be okay for drivers to say they didn't know?

Bristol is a nice place to be a student. But there are also many things that annoyed me. 

- ""Cycling city"" is a lie.
 
- ""Green city"" is a lie.
 
- Having multiple bus companies in one city is bullshit. If you get an annual/monthly bus pass, get one for First busses. It's more expensive than Wessex, but still cheaper than it was for me at home (Stavanger). 

- I expected trains in the UK to be... good. But you might as well get a National Express bus for short distances (eg London) and fly for longer distances. 

- The water is gross. 

- There are drunk people everywhere. All the time. 

Complaints aside, there are many things you should take advantage of while you are here (other than the absurdly cheap food!). There is so much to see in the UK compared to home! If you are able to travel during your time here, I would strongly recommend seeing as much as possible. The UK has a lot more history than we are used to, and it has been preserved very well. 

Of course if you have specific questions then this subreddit or my inbox is the right place to put them!

Which she could have found out if she'd spent five minutes researching the area. 

Likewise old sooty buildings: well *duh* ... many of them were built a long time ago and we used a hell of a lot of coal for much of their lifespan. Sandblasting them clean can work but is expensive and can damage stonework. 

Unfriendly attitude: perhaps that's how she perceived it but we're just being ourselves. She may expect fawning enthusiasm from service staff but we find it insincere, and artificial.

null,null,whole_scottish_milk,null,null,null,"&gt; Thanks for putting words in my mouth. Not once have I said that if someone were being mobbed that they should be punished, but thanks for trying.

You said 

&gt;If they aren't doing the required checks to make sure they aren't breaking any laws, then they should be penalised.

It's obvious what you meant, you said something stupid and are now trying to wiggle your way out of it with semantics. What exactly do you think happens at Calais anyway? People get mobbed and can't do anything about it. It's not loaded with truck drivers shouting ""Jump on lads! England awaits!""

&gt;If a driver had done all they can within reason to prevent someone accessing their vehicle, then of course they should be okay to carry on without any fine. From what I've read, that's also the line the police are taking.

""Had done all they can"" as in ""nothing""? Because that is about all they can do.

So now, not only do you want to fine drivers for something they have no power over, you also want to spend money trying to charge them with something in court, and the immigrant problem at Calais will *still* be there. I'm not seeing where this plan is supposed to have an effect.

If you punish the powerless drivers, you are just sweeping the problem under the rug yet again.

&gt;If you buy a car, you carry out checks to make sure there's no finance on it and it isn't stolen. If you don't do those checks, you cannot act as though it's not your problem when the car gets towed away.

Posted by JOHN MANN MP 0pc on July 23, 2015
23 July 2015

Dear Jeremy,

As you know, for decades there was widespread child sexual abuse taking place in the London Borough of Islington. The extent of the abuse was only uncovered through the tenacity and bravery of whistle-blowers, journalists and survivors which led to a number of independent inquiries and the damning Ian White report in 1995.

As with the rest of the country, the reality is that child abuse was rampant, ignored, covered up and the extent of it is only just beginning to come to light. The attitude was that of the Head of MI5, who was revealed yesterday to have written about a paedophile MP to the then Cabinet Secretary Sir Robert Armstrong in 1986: âAt the present stageâ¦the risks of political embarrassment to the government is rather greater than the security dangerâ

At an event I hosted this year in Parliament of 200 child abuse and exploitation survivors, we received public testimony of the scale of abuse in Islington from a whistle-blower who was a leading light in uncovering child abuse in Islington during the 1980s and early 1990s. This social worker confirmed to me that she and others met with you in the early 1990s to raise her concerns about child abuse and cover-ups in Islington. You said that you would raise the matter with Virginia Bottomley, then at the Department of Health, but no indication of whether you followed this up was ever given.

In 1986 MP Geoffrey Dickens raised serious concerns about child abuse in Islington.

Your response was to complain to the Speaker about him visiting your constituency without informing you. I have faced such complaints myself in pursuing corruption issues.

There are many people who also rubbished the idiosyncratic Mr Dickens. They have been proven to be wrong, indeed I have just received details of another list of names of alleged and now proven paedophiles that Dickens provided to Leon Brittan as Home Secretary, not related to Islington, but further corroboration of the scale of the cover up that has taken place.

On February 17th 1986 you had called in Parliament for Geoffrey Dickens to âunreservedly withdraw his allegations of the existence of child brothels in the area (in Islington) and make a public apology.â You further called Mr Dickens âirresponsibleââ.

You inadvertently helped the rubbishing and the cover up of all of the Dickens allegations. Indeed your actions encouraged others, because a week later the Islington Gazette published a letter attacking Geoffrey Dickens over his allegations from Roger Moody, a prominent pro paedophilia activist.

On May 30th 1995 the Independent reported that: âThe Labour Borough (of Islington) has finally put its hands up. Last week an independent report confirmed that pimps, paedophiles and pornographers had for years preyed on children in Islington's homes.â The reporters highlights the inaction of the council and notes that: âSome social workers met Islington Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn begging him to influence the council, then still denying everything. Soon after, I met him. He did make inquiries but was reassured. There the matter rested.â

You might wish to read, if you have not had the time already, the superb speech made by Ann Clwyd in the House of Commons last Thursday in which she painstakingly explained the insidious role of insurance companies in ensuring that councilsâ refused and refuse to accept liability or responsibility for children they looked after, including in North Wales, but which can also be extended to my own in Nottinghamshire and nearby Nottingham.

Perhaps most worrying of all are the implications of your question to the Home Secretary on November 3rd 2014.

You stated that âFinally in my own borough of Islington there have been complaints about Islington childrenâs homes in the past and the council has investigated them.â  This statement at first glance is non contentious. However on reflection is an extraordinary statement considering the representations made to you in the past that the council was in fact covering up abuse and not listening to the survivors, issues you were challenged on at the time.

Repeatedly across the country, institutions investigating allegations about themselves over child abuse have heard nothing, seen nothing and known nothing. This is at the very heart of the cover up culture.

I know you through your work on Central African and Latin American human rights issues, and am quite certain that you are a man of the highest personal integrity and ethics. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that.

My concern is about your politics and how that results in actions, or in this case non-actions. As we have seen with the appalling misjudgements of the NCCL and its allowance of membership to the Paedophile Information Exchange in the 1970s, sections of the left were in denial of the motivations of some campaigners and this unwillingness to face up to unpalatable possibilities clouded judgement over the most serious of allegations.

In fact the allegations were true and are true as survivors increasingly choose to speak out. The establishment and sections of the left stood by and allowed childrenâs lives to be destroyed.

The reason that your response and inactions to these matters is worthy of specific scrutiny is that unlike others who did not see what was happening, or as we saw with Saville, kept their suspicions to themselves rather than speak out or investigate, you are wishing to lead the Labour Party during the period of Goddard inquiry into child abuse and are seeking become Prime Minister.

The so called âtrendy leftâ politics of the early 1980s was a contributory factor in covering up child abuse. I myself saw that repeatedly at first hand in Lambeth. Meanwhile children were murdered and disappeared, were raped and beaten, forced into prostitution, trafficked around and a significant number of lives destroyed and blighted.

Your inaction in the 1980s and 1990s says a lot, not about your personal character, which I admire, but about your politics which I do not. Your carefully worded excusing of Islington Council in the House of Commons equally demonstrates why it is inappropriate for you to attempt to lead the Labour Party at the critical time of the Goddard Enquiry, as child abuse is the issue that will haunt this Parliament.

 Yours Sincerely

 

 John Mann MP

I think it's important to look at BRs years and in those, the second half of the season always has a higher ppg. I'm also pretty sure the numbers are the same while he was at Swansea. Reason I'm saying this is because BRs teams are conditioned to do better later in the season. He tweaks his tactics as the season goes on, adding to them when he finds a good vein and trying new ones when not. It's also a reason it takes players a while to bed in. I read about this in an article comparing BR and Roberto Martinez so I'm not pulling this out of my ass btw. Just thought it was an interesting thing I read so I wanted to mention it. Anyways, I bet we're going to have a slow start because of this. Milner and Clyne will come in and do well but I expect benteke and firmino to take about half a season. I'm really looking forward to seeing them play and I'm excited but I wouldn't be surprised if we had a slow start. With all that being said, we are going to be damn good in the second half of the season and I think we can challenge for top four.

We were running a massive deficit by the time the coalition came into office. Since then the deficit has been steadily dropping.

Think of it this way. Labour was driving a massive, heavy lorry and before they left office slammed their foot on the accelerator. This took our speed up to the fastest the truck has ever been. The tories come to power and steadily apply the brakes. What you are saying is that the truck is going faster then ever and that we have travelled further under the tories than under labour.

Yes, history is open to interpretation, but that doesn't mean all interpretations or opinions are equal. Some have more basis in fact than others. That Catholics suffered oppression under British rule is a fact; that Presbyterians (who make up the majority of the OO's membership) were granted civil and religious liberty following the Battle of the Boyne is a lie.

I'm on mobile so I'm hoping someone else will give you a proper reply. I wanted to briefly address a couple of your points.

Firstly, have you read about the success that states there legalised have had? This article covers the key financial points and hopefully highlights that there is a significant economic benefit : http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/02/12/colorados-legal-weed-market-700-million-in-sales-last-year-1-billion-by-2016/
    
The majority of individuals don't want to have to buy from a dealer. Given the choice they'd pay extra for the convenience, choice, and security of a regulated market. This can be seen by the fact that the cannabis industry is booming in states that have legalised. Additionally given time big companies will be able to drive prices down - alcohol has been a black market item in the past. 
    
Lastly, for the individuals who want to get cheaper cannabis they have the option of growing their own without the worry of being arrested. This relates to your first point. A large subsection of the population uses cannabis - the majority of them enjoying it responsibly. Legalisation would ensure they're not treated like criminals for a relatively harmless past time. By almost every metric cannabis is safer than alcohol and tobacco.
    
I respect your view but think that with a serious look at the evidence - my pro cannabis arguments can all be backed up with data from legalised states and countries - the only sensible outcome is a change in drug policy. Legalisation isn't the only option but it's what I favour.

Our main difference is that you only pay for exactly what you need. But we're also set up as a super simple &amp; fast mobile app. So no long horrible form filling. Once you've joined, the time to get covered is measured in seconds.

In terms of price difference - 3 hours is about half the price of 24. 1 hour is about a quarter the price of 24. So it definitely is worth only paying for what you use.

The Motor Insurance Database (MID) only refreshes once a day, so it's very likely that your policy will be over before it's on the MID. However, the police do have a number they can use to call us, and we will confirm that the policy is legitimate.

Right... That was my point. That's what I said and exactly what I meant. If some stranger gives you Â£500k for no apparent reason, you carry out checks before you start spending it because the police will take it all back if you were handling stolen money (Ps, this is another analogy. There aren't any immigrants in this analogy either)

&gt; A better way would be to just find a better paying job. Sounds like you're getting mugged off at your current job.

I shall answer this point and your question at the same time as when you see my job description you hopefully see why I cannot just waltz into a new job.  However I am trying not to give too much personal information away as I wouldn't want to be identified by my employer.  I may have to delete this comment later if I think I've given too much information.

Each faculty within the college has its team of technicians - Science, Art, PE and there's the Admin staff and library too. There about the same number of support staff as teachers.  We're all paid about half that the teachers are paid but many of us are as qualified.  Some technicians have MA's and PHD's.  Support staff salaries start at about 14k.  I don't know how they make ends meet!

I am the theatre technician.  I co-ordinate all performances relating to 'entertainment industry' based A-levels. So I work with about 4 or 5 different departments to create about 30 shows a year (on my own) that the students perform in.  To para-phrase the original job description. ""Wanted: Theatre technician with Lighting and Sound engineering experience. IT and AV skills also essential.  Must be able to design, build and paint theatre sets, props and scenery and have sewing, costume and makeup skills.  Teaching qualification desirable"".    I can do all these things as I have worked in all these separate areas within the theatre industry.  I am excellent value for money as they don't need to employ 5 or 6 different people but I am not experienced enough in any individual area to compete for work with people who are subject specialists. 

I suppose my biggest millstone has been never having been able to afford a workroom to work freelance which is why I ended up in education.

She's not supposed to be funny though, and that's the reason that I'm fairly certain she's actually pretty smart in truth.

Katie Hopkins has three target audiences. She targets the people who read The Sun, think we should nuke the middle east and shoot every imigrunts boat in the med. She also targets The Guardian readers who are outraged when she directly plays to the first group, enraging them and causing them to fume and froth and write articles condemning her and decrying this obviously awful person. She *also* targets a third group, who find this entire circus to be extremely entertaining, and enjoy watching the second group descend to the depths of the first in their crusade to have her banned, demonised, dehumanised, imprisoned, and just generally ruined as a person.

People think she's aiming at the first group and unwittingly pissing off the second, she's not, she's aiming at both equally in full knowledge that the third group will enjoy the howls of protest.

In that way, anyone who really gets enraged her is falling into the trap of doing *exactly* what she wants you to do, which is to get angry and take her seriously and shout and yell.

It was a simple run of the mill sitcom in the style of Only Fools and Horses about a family living in a run down town up in the valleys of Wales, where they take in an American lodger who becomes part of the community.

It was silly, a little irreverent, but mostly I loved it because growing up I didn't feel like there was enough decent Welsh programming on TV.

Our midfield is really weird if we do that though... if we play Milner/Hendo/Coutinho as the 3 with Firmino at the tip of the diamond then we're looking a little bit defensively suspect I think.  Maybe the amazing work rate and energy from the 4 of them does the job, but I can't help but feel like we want a little more physical presence/power in there.  I'm not sure who would get dropped from that group though, they're clearly all intended to play as much as they can (Milner wouldn't be here without that assurance, Hendo is the captain, Firmino was Â£29mil there's no way we plan on using him as a rotational player, and Coutinho is Coutinho).  Either way, imagine the attacking potential in something like this:

----------------Mignolet---------------

Clyne---Skrtel---Sakho---Gomez

---------------Henderson--------------

-----Milner-------------Coutinho----

----------------Firmino----------------

------Sturrdige------Benteke------

I'd say it shows the reverse.

Overall satisfaction with the service of investigating burglaries didn't change even though they made a conscious decision to ignore 50% of them.

To my mind, that says that while the cuts may impact how services are delivered, they needn't make much difference to the end result. (It also suggests that the police can't be doing a terribly good job at solving house burglaries - which makes sense because if you look into it, you'll find that relatively minor crimes like house burglaries are almost never solved.

I find it odd that you can watch Chelsea for 30 years and be upset that the ""newer"" mentality of purchasing players isn't fitting your rhetoric and preference?

The fact of the matter is that this squad is not as bad as you are painting it to be.  If Mou thinks Victor Moses will make a strong showing this year, who are we to question it, truly? He could have solid pace and he's certainly aggressive... so let's wait and see. Oscar had a down year last year - who's to say that he won't bounce back and make up your perceived goal/attacking problem? If Falcao plays well he would be a great breath of fresh air and help put the ball in the net.  Hell, Drogba served his purpose last season but wasn't exactly lighting it up.

All I'm getting at here is that this whole thing, at face value, seems to epitomize why people hate Chelsea. The squad is a costly one to begin with - drenched with talent.  You aren't happy that they didn't spend MORE money? Sorry, that's not how it always works.

Hell, Chelsea won the league last year... let's not act like they were just asking the question.  This squad isn't broken and needing some total re-haul or a bank-busting ""top"" player.  If anything, I'm nervous that our holding spot aside Matic is still so weak.

Not at all, but a quote as to what you were referring to in the original point would be better than leaving us to guess.

Maybe the planners of the rising did not count on executions to sway the public unless of course you actually do figure Pearse's 'blood sacrifice' into the equation, psychotic talk that it may well have been.

It's not 'too much of a generalisation'. The Dublin papers blamed those involved in the rising. Remember many of the reserve units involved in crushing the Rising were Irish battalions. Dubliners for their part got on with their lives in wartime Dublin. Civilians attempted to stop the rising from operating in their own streets.

And I'm not sure how anywhere was war weary in 1919 given the war ended the year before. Partition was never officially on the table until the immediate aftermath of the easter rising. Churchill himself didn't see it coming. From that point on though it was never off the table. Clearly the rising cemented partition.

You often bring up 'working class militancy' in Belfast and I'm not sure how you can claim Dubliners didn't resent the rising on the one hand while arguing Belfast was about to turn into another 1798 on the other while keeping a straight face. Yes there was agitation, but like Dublin it's 'militancy' was favoured by no more than a relative handful.

His short game seems tidy and quick and he always seems available for the outball. It's his long range balls that really excite me though.

Agreed on Dier for sure, he's consistently given the ball away in these games, and he's clearly not comfortable yet.

So that fucking game in 2014, yeah THAT one. This fucker is so pissed that the FA/Sky/whatevs scheduled our match on a Sunday before a champions league week that he was simply out for revenge against them. He set his team up not to win, and not even to draw. He sent his team out there with the simple goal of making that game unwatchable. 12 minutes of obvious time-wasting in the 1st half, ridiculously negative tactics. And what happens? What's his reward for being such a fucking prickish child? A fucking bolt-from-the-blue error by the one player on that field who'd done nothing to deserve it IN THE STOPPAGE TIME HIS FUCKING TEAM CREATED BY BEING PRICKS gifts that fucker 3 pts.

He is a genuine politician that is true to his beleifs, and has been for nearly 40 years, I really doubt hes the kind of guy ""to not take it seriousy"" lol.

2. If they get up and move and take their jobs with them so be it, but we would have to raise it hell of a lot before that happens. Our country is extremely beneficial to corporations for our geographical location, or educated population and our infrastructure. 

3. For this analogy to be valid, it would be the state that allowed the man to fish in the river, and the state who taught the man to fish.

5. You need an NHS for maximum work force efficiency.

6. "" If a rich man wants to help the poor, he should pay his taxes gladly, not dole out money at a whim."" - I think that we should take enough money to fund free education, a free at point of use NHS, and have a welfare state with no cracks in it, so everyone has a bed, food and heat.

7. He wants nationalization of the railways, not privatization, but it is fairly common knowledge that the one public rail company was better than all the private ones. That's why they got rid of it, can't be having people see things run better in the hands of the government

8. In a world with 0 regulations what would stop asda and tesco putting all other shops out of business through being able to afford to lower prices due to tax avoidance. What would then happen if Tesco and Asda upon knowing they had the monopoly agreed to drive the price up on everything a certain amount, what would your response be?

It seems like we're not really arguing the same thing you're talking about a free market in which regulations don't exist, which isn't sustainable, therefor not possible. I'm referring to the society we are in now, in which instead of having a set of rules and regulations the free market has to abide by to conduct itself, we have a regulate around the rough edges mentality, which clearly isn't working.

Bang on. There's been a couple of examples of this over the last few years. 

Ancelotti rated McEachran and gave him a run in the first team, however none of his predecessors did and farmed him out on loan. Benetiz started Ake in a few games towards the end of his tenure, but then Mourinho relegated him to the U21s again after his arrival and only started to see glimpses of the first team again last season.

&gt; We expect Mou to stay at Chelsea for the long-term, now. We havent had a manager whos stayed for longer than a season or two, in over a decade. Therefore, developing players are now treated consistently. 

I never considered this before. United and Arsenal are famed for bringing through talent from youth level, and both the managers who precided over these sides had lengthy tenures.

You've been watching Chelsea for 30 fucking years and this is your wise perspective?  A lot of league winners will *want* to win the Champion's League... but only one team can.  A lot of amazing teams are in Europe. It isn't some cake walk ... and signing Greizman or someone else doesn't necessarily guarantee anything beyond another knock-out round loss.  PSG won their fucking league last year - why is that a disgrace to go out against them? Arguments can certainly be made that it shouldn't have happened, but it isn't like some second class squad beat us.

I'm not trying to be optimistic - I'm trying to be fucking **realistic**.  I'm honestly baffled that you can throw 30 years around and then demand MORE signings.  This squad is great.  If you don't think they can compete, that's on you.  I see a quality back line with a fantastic keeper.  I see one of the best holding midfield players in the game.  I see a Hazard, Cesc, Oscar, Willian, etc who can certainly do their part in the midfield. I see one of the EPL's scariest finishers in Costa and a supporting striker crew that is nothing to sneeze at.  All in all, this squad is still great.

Also, the final point you make about how teams don't just suddenly decline - nobody is suggesting this, rather they are ON the decline. Your point is moot.

&gt; such a dealbreaker for playing him when Johnson 

Yeah, and most people were unhappy with Johnson being used as much as he was. That was evident from the match, and post-match, threads on here and r/soccer. Similarly, people seem to be unhappy with Enrique playing (I know I am) but we don't get to moan about it as often because he hardly plays. 

&gt; Coutinho not being able to finish matches 

My point isn't that Enrique *can't* finish matches, my point is that Enrique isn't match fit -- Coutinho plays very well for 70 odd minutes, then gets subbed because he's knackered. Enrique doesn't play very well, struggles to make any impact on the game, and is then knackered. One player adds something and another doesn't.

1: Chinese students are not encouraged to challenge the authority. Wrong. During my high school days, usually you are not encouraged to ask questions in the class because it will interrupt the teacher and your questions may be solved by just asking other students. However you are extremely encouraged to ask questions during the  break or just go to teachers' offices directly. (Actually it is quite common for the teacher to be surrounded by a swarm of students who got questions during the break in a chinese HS).
2 Chinese education system is all about memorizing equations. Wrong. My math teacher always say that never trying to memorize the equations without knowing how to derive it first. 
3 teachers are terrifying regarded by his students. Depends. Some teachers like to establish a grim public perception so students can  pay respects and follow his orders. However in most cases teachers are playing a friend and dad/mom role in our system. Usually thats happening off the classes. So teacher in china isnt just a job, the society values teachers as someone to nurture those young prospects in all aspects.(Teachers dont earn too much usually but they got respects from all social classes) .

I hope this helps people get a good idea of just how quickly they will beat nearly everything with four wheels without winding up their local Neds, Coppers or inserting themselves up the backside of the lorry still trying to move away at the next set of lights. 

According to this even my big traillie makes 0-60 in around 5.4 seconds. To match that a Subaru Impreza needs a expensive WRX in it's model name to come close or to beat it. 

For the OP: the slowest GSXR 600 models makes 60 in 3.7 seconds, comfortably a second faster than the quickest Impreza. 

My personal take on pulling away depends on the road, traffic and mood. Most occasions it is obvious by the time I'm at the speed limit I've got a decent gap on them and will keep it. If they are really determined to get ahead once up to speed I'll give them the space to pass me if it is safe and then catch up and likely pass them at the next set of lights or the next slower moving vehicle they can't get past. If they are driving like a total nob and trying dangerous overtakes etc, I'll stay well back and give myself time to avoid any of the possible carnage.

Of any politician in Westminster, he stuck out as the only one who actually stuck by the principles he believed no matter what, fearing no consequences.

It's too much to get into but they were very much the mouthpieces of the upper classes and Dublin unionists. Not at all relenting the opinion of the Dublin working people.

Neither have I come across much actual resistance from the general populace other than ambivalence. Many people I the vicinity of the Rising stopped to watch the street fights for entertainment.  It caused a couple of deaths and you can see so examples of the phenomenon if you look at Pathe's YouTube channel for videos on the Four Courts battle.

They were war weary like much of the UK. Remember that the war had only ended a few months before and if you go out for a run you don't get fresh and full of life the moment you stop. They had been over worked and under paid for the war effort and now was their chance to fight back as employers didn't want to let up those conditions much.

Partition was something debated before the First World War even started. Now maybe it wasn't as likely until after the Rising but it wasn't unavoidable until after the last alternative had run out.

I wasn't claiming Dubliners didn't resent the Rising before the executions. I was disagreeing with your given motive for their resentment. It was much more due to their material and personal losses than feeling like soldiers on the front lines had been betrayed, though some might have felt that.

Meanwhile Belfast wasn't about to turn into a 1798. The Lord Lieutenant was more worried of it turning it another 1917. The city was under the control of a strike committee and the army needed to be sent in. The workers wanted to further while the strike committee wanted to moderate things. Keep in mind the wider context of the UK at the time with strikes and mutinies of still mobilised soldiers  happening all over the country. Which do you think the ruling class would worry more about?

null,null,Ewannnn,null,null,null,"Two issues, firstly if you start building houses now it's going to take a long time to solve the problem, decades even. I don't know how successful rent controls are, I've read people say they're useless but I haven't looked into it myself. That being said, if it works, as I guess he thinks it will, it's there to tide us over till rents are under control again.

Secondly, the issue with right to buy, or allowing council housing tenants to buy their property is then affordable housing disappears from the market. This is an issue because once that housing is gone, you can never get it back without spending vast sums of money (house prices are higher now). So for instance, you have somewhere like Camden that used to have a lot of council housing which is now private. But there are still people living in Camden &amp; unemployed people there that need affordable housing. This means that we have people living in privately rented accommodation there &amp; we have to pay for that via massive housing benefit fees. It would be better if the council had held onto more council housing there &amp; not sold it off, then we wouldn't have this massive housing bill &amp; the council could rent these properties to tenants on low incomes. 

The alternative is to lower housing benefit, or as they're doing putting in a benefit cap that essentially makes all these areas unaffordable. So now if you lose your job, or on low income you'll have to move outside the city &amp; commute.

Like you, I'd never heard of Kids Company until today, so I wasn't sure why it was such massive news that it was closing - if it's the angle that they miss-spent funds that the Prime Minister ensured they were given then OK, but again, that doesn't seem to be ***it***.

Another thing I found odd is that, having never heard of them, looking them up in the news reveals this story from just last week:['Met police launch inquiry into Kids Company over child abuse claims '](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/30/met-police-launch-inquiry-into-kids-company-over-child-abuse-claims), and again this hasn't been mentioned in any of the news today. It is likely entirely coincidental, but especially at a time when child abuse is a big story, it seems strange that despite the Met undertaking an investigation into the organisation just last week, there's been no or little mention of this fact when it comes under scrutiny again this week.

I honestly believe this squad can score goals if they need to.  I don't think the *squad* will be the issue.  Mou, for all of his benefits, loves to sit back and hit on the break.  Only certain players fit that scheme and only certain players will really thrive in that system.  Unless Mou is going to radically change our play style and suddenly open everything up, this squad still sets up very nicely for that style of play.

I would have loved to *really* go after Griezmann. He's a wizard on the pitch and assuredly would have made us even more dangerous... but I'm not sure how realistic those bids ever were as well as if Atletico was asking for a king's ransom.  I would prefer to have someone else sitting back to allow Cesc to move up the pitch.  When I see Cesc and Matic at the holding spots, it makes me sad. He can't play defensively the way he contributes in the final third.  

It's a tough pill to swallow when other teams are spending money and getting all of these new, fun toys.  But the reality is that they don't always work out.  To prove both your point and perhaps mine, Falcao was a flop at United. Perhaps now, on loan, he's going to feel less pressure and do extremely well.  If he finds his form with us, people will laud that move as a tremendous success.

Hell, remember Tottenham bringing in an army of new players following Bale's departure? No real success with that.  City is always chasing players in the international market and have still yet to sniff much Champion's league success... so it's all tricky.  I'd much rather be in a position to make minor tweaks to a proven, championship squad than being hungry as a chasing team having to make big moves.

null,null,rothwick,present,,null,"- How do you think this season will go?

I firmly believe Mourinho has everything under control in the sense that yes, we will be challenging heavily in the premier league and in the different cups. However I believe he will put more emphasis on Champions League (In the case that he has to prioritize one over the other in the knockout stages vs run up to the title when big fixtures are tight as fuck). 

Defending the League Title is definitively a strong possibility. 



- Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?

Hazard. The man is pure quality and he will have an equal or better season than last. It will be a hazardous year for all the RB's opposing us. 


- How do you think the team will line up?

Fairly unchanged starting 11 is the most realistic scenario. The biggest difference this year is depth.

If people want to pull wool over their eyes to make themselves feel better and pretend Sakho is favoured over Lovren then they can, but all the evidence suggests that he isn't and he won't be moving forward. Lovren is, by all accounts, a Rodgers' purchase whilst Sakho is a committee purchase. Rodgers has a history of favouring his own purchases; this is a prime example. Lovren has been favoured over Sakho this preseason and last season, as I mentioned, before he made the most errors leading to goals for any outfield player in the premier league before Christmas. At that point his position was untenable so Sakho took his place. You've given reasons why it might make sense to buy a defender of Lovren's profile but ignored the evidence. Guess who is rumoured to start vs. Stoke? Lovren. Despite being clearly, in the opinion of most, the lesser defender of the two.

null,null,TheMysteriousShadow,lfc68,,null,"&gt; Lovren is, by all accounts, a Rodgers' purchase whilst Sakho is a committee purchase 

And what accounts are those? As far as I'm aware, no reliable source has mentioned that this is the case, and its something that some fans have just taken as fact. 

&gt; Lovren has been favoured this preseason 

I can't argue with that, but the reasons for this are possibly less nefarious than you believe. Sakho is injury prone and, at some point this season, it is likely that he'll be out of the team -- that leaves Skrtel and Lovren as the cover, unless Rodgers uses Gomez or Illori there. Now, would you rather the defensive frailties of Skrtel-Lovren be ironed out in an important PL game or a friendly against Helsinki? I know which one I'd rather. 

Of course, that might not be the whole reason, but I'm just giving my opinion on the situation as it stands. I'm also very aware that it's a very likely possibility that Sakho wasn't used in the Helsinki game due to his other half being heavily pregnant. 

&gt; guess who is rumoured to start 

Yeah, rumoured. It might happen but at this point its unclear and pure speculation.

null,null,TheColinous,cnty-scotland,Scotland,null,"&gt; Two issues, firstly if you start building houses now it's going to take a long time to solve the problem, decades even. I don't know how successful rent controls are, I've read people say they're useless but I haven't looked into it myself. That being said, if it works, as I guess he thinks it will, it's there to tide us over till rents are under control again.

Stockholm has strict rent control and extensive social housing schemes. The rent controls have moved social housing into the black economy. If you try to get a flat legit, you'll face waiting times of a decade or more.

People don't quit social housing contracts, they transfer them to someone else. That transfer is often handled by dodgy estate agents who get a cut of a transfer that can give a contract holder tens of thousands of pounds.

I've heard it's better in Berlin, but Berlin is kind of a special case. It didn't have a housing shortage like London and Stockholm does.

Edit: I don't like the term social housing about Sweden because it gives the wrong impression, but I can't come up with a term that's comparable. Each municipality in Sweden has a company that owns houses and flat. Those companies rent out the houses and flats to people. They are a natural part of the housing economy, and they operate on the same principle as the private landlords. There's no such thing as a non-profit public housing company in Sweden.

Apologies for potato-quality photography. Luckily it's not potato-quality products! The light blew in my room so I can't get beauty shots, I'm afraid, but I can supply additional shots upon request.

This rig was built 3 months ago. It's worked flawlessly since then. It's taken everything I've thrown at it, and if I weren't leaving the country soon I'd be keeping it. So I've decided to sell it to you wonderful people!

ALSO INCLUDED with purchase of main rig:

* 2x Xbox 360 Controllers (wireless) with included wireless receiver.
* Microphone for video calls etc.
* Sundry additional cables, original boxes, screws and spare parts that came with the initial components.
* Fully articulated desk-mounted monitor stand for dual monitors (as pictured, was a bitch to find and put together as the QNIX is so damn big)
* Original freestanding monitor mounts
* Original heatsink/cooler for Intel CPU

Price for everything above together: Â£1250 plus postage. Collection would be fan-fuckin'-tastic as the monitors in particular are a bitch to ship. 

Things I will do: sell the tower, keyboard and monitors separately, if needs be.

Things I will not do: pull parts out of the tower.

***OTHER THINGS FOR SAAAALE! IT'S A BONANZA!***

I've also got some additional odds and ends related to this rig that I'm happy to part with as well:

* Intel i3-3250 processor - used once (perfect condition) and stock cooler: Â£55
* Sapphire R9 270x - used twice (near-perfect condition) and included power and graphics cables: Â£80
* Corsair H55 liquid CPU cooler and Kraken GPU bracket for mounting cooler to your graphics card (bought but never used): Â£40
* PowerLine Ethernet-through-mains adapters - run high-speed internet through a power socket (yes, this is a real thing - it was my primary way of hooking up my machine to the internet, and it works extremely well): Â£20

I mean, he's got a decent idea here which is to embark on a huge council funded building of affordable homes. That, is a good idea. 

But then he's just needlessly thrown in some pointless populist policies in the form of rent control. 

If you're building enough houses, then rent control isn't needed. You'll increase the supply, and bring down the price. There's just no need to kick Landlords like that. 

I'm not their biggest fans, but I don't want to see them bankrupted. It won't be the slumlords that get hurt by these policies, as they'll just ignore the various laws anyway as they do now. 

Increase supply, and let that put a downward pressure on house prices and rent. 

I'm not really sure if he's advocating council housing (as in you rent from the council, and the council always owns the house) or affordable housing (non-profit house building). 

I don't think we should return to actual council housing. I think people should be encouraged to eventually own the homes they're paying rent to the council on. I think it would encourage a sense of collective responsibility for the areas that these houses are built in and stop them turning into shitholes like a lot of council estates have in the past. I'd say evidence for this would be the many council estates which are almost entirely privately owned. They're generally much nicer places than they were when they were only council tenants. 

This could be done by a form of 'council equity' where 30% (or something more calculated) of your rent each month is saved and counts towards equity in the property. The other 70% goes to the council for repairs and the loan they took to build the place. If people know they own 5% of a home, or whatever, they're more likely to care about it.

The key gains for TSB and Nationwide is they pay 5% on the funds upto Â£2k/Â£2.5k, whereas SAN and Lloyds requires thresholds to be met and the %rate increases with them.
If you have two accounts, transferring money between them over the month to meet deposit requirements is possible, they usually just state you cant have internal transfer (transfers between accounts with the same company e.g santander - santander, where Lloyds to nationwide is just dandy and fine.)

We're blessed in that we can keep the likes of him and Hill around - many teams not that much further down the pyramid don't have that financial luxury.

They are expected to be actively looking for work and most are.  Last time I was at the job centre, a woman was 15 minutes late because the bus broke down and she was sanctioned.  

A sanction is for 1 month at least, no matter what the infraction was.  The point being, is that if they don't have a job, they aren't getting benefits and they don't have family to rely on they are royally fucked.

Amen. In the wise words of George Orwell:

&gt;First of all, one should use Indian or Ceylonese tea. China tea has virtues which are not to be despised nowadays â it is economical, and one can drink it without milk â but there is not much stimulation in it. One does not feel wiser, braver or more optimistic after drinking it. Anyone who has used that comforting phrase 'a nice cup of tea' invariably means Indian tea.

- Cech is a legend and will be missed but Begovic is an awesome #2 keeper.

- We need somebody who can shoot from range. This keeps opposing defenses honest and makes sure that the opposing goalkeeper doesn't get a good jump on balls played forward. We've been missing this threat since Lampard left.

- Still waiting for Oscar to bloom into his early-season form from last year. Moses looks pretty good. Cuadrado hasn't impressed me once in a Chelsea kit (kind of pissed he took #11 too). 

- RLC looked composed as always. As long as Matic is on the field, I think RLC can be an upgrade for the Mikel role. Especially attack-wise. 

- Ramires gets a lot of hate here but he's a true box-to-box with great movement and workrate. Good defense and good passing. Finishing isn't his strong point though.

Anecdotally there also seems to be a bit of a push at the moment to get people off Employment Support Allowance(ESA). Sometimes this is fine but a lot of people on ESA struggle to find work due to challenges they face and can find it difficult to perform the 'directions' given to them by the job centre / DWP.

Now do some people play the game and stay on JSA when they could work? No I don't see many people like that come to us (I know anecdotes are not worth much but we tend to find out quite quickly if they are searching for work or not)

I guess I'd be looking for about Â£175 for the monitor on its own, but I'd much rather sell both monitors and the stand together as it means I don't have to take the whole thing apart and be left with parts that are harder to sell. The stand especially I had to piece together from a few sources as most of the ones you find on Amazon don't comfortably fit the QNIX, which meant I had to find additional arms on eBay which were nearly as expensive again as the initial stand, so that worked out at around Â£60 at point of purchase.

The scoring part for me is interesting.  I think Oscar will return to his scoring form.  Last season he was not able to adjust when Cesc arrived and I don't believe he knew his place in the squad.  He had been Mou's golden child for years (Hence Mata's departure) and suddenly he wasn't pulling the strings as he once was.  From there, his form and scoring ability suffered.  I'd love to see him wake up and play.

I'm hopeful that Willian can tap into his true, Brazilian roots and understand how to finish.  His work ethic is fantastic and he's creative enough to justify regular starts... but his finishing isn't quite there, consistently.  If he could evolve to be more than a work-horse, I'd love that.

One has to imagine that Cuadrado will wake up and hit his stride.  Players that come in January are typically either boom or bust, I feel.  There's no way a player of his caliber will continue to look *THAT* lost on the pitch. I think he was trying to prove too much in his first experience in the EPL.  I think he will settle in and be a scoring threat.

The Falcao thing is really hard to tell. I think he looked reasonably sharp and spry in the pre-season matches and could potentially be helpful.  I think the real loser with Falcao on the squad is Remy. He's always been Johnny on the Spot and finds ways to score. I feel like Falcao, by name alone, will get more playing time.  I hope that he scores enough to justify his existence on the squad.  But, again, for a loan... worth a die roll.

And the Costa part is horrifying to me.  The fact that he's even playing in pre-season and other matches makes me want to pull hair out.  I hate the lesser tournaments/matches when not necessary for guys like him.  I think the one added benefit is the addition by subtraction of Drogba.  Of course we love him and he's a king... but his form is what it is. He wasn't a star this last season - he was a role player that served his part.  I don't think we will see the same level of pressure and appearances from Costa with Remy *and* Falcao.  Maybe Costa will get more rest in lesser games so he isn't constantly pushing the envelope on a potential hamstring explosion.

I think this weekend will be interesting.  I'd guess that we come out hot and win comfortably.  It's games like this that Hazard typically goes crazy and scores at least once.  We will likely score from a set piece because of our height advantage as well as skill in the area... but we shall see.

null,null,dsgn09,null,null,null,"**How do you think this season will go?**

I think most Chelsea fans would agree that we expect another season close to the top of the Premier League, with a solid showing in the Champions League and domestic cups as well. We have a very similar team to the title-winning squad from last year, and expect similar success. Players like Oscar (coming off his first summer without football in six years), Remy (showed true quality in his limited chances last year), and Matic are expected to have even more important roles to play as we compete for multiple trophies. Moreover, players like Falcao, Moses, and Cuadrado will be looking to impress as they try to break into the first team consistently.

That said, our rivals have gotten better. Manchester United has spent a lot of money to improve their side and look to pose a bigger threat in the league this year. The same could be said for Arsenal and Manchester City, who have the talent to challenge for the title if they are able to stay fit. For Chelsea, the big question mark is consistency.

**Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?**

Eden Hazard has to be the answer. He is integral to our offensive success, and is coming off his most successful season with the club since arriving in 2012. We need him to score more goals, but few can deny his importance to Chelsea. Shout-outs can easily go to Nemanja Matic and John Terry, who provide stability to one of the strongest defensive sides in the premier league. 

**How do you think the team will line up?** 

[This](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=8904) is most likely for the PL, with some rotation depending on the competition.

------------Courtois

Ivanovic - Cahill - Terry - Dave

--------Fabregas - Matic

-----Willian - Oscar - Hazard

Honestly less confident than last season. The lack of form of key players being a major concern and may cause a shaky start. But i fully believe in mourinho to fix it and get results regardless of form. I believe we'll try to atleast reach the semi finals of CL and 1/2nd place of Premier league.

Hazard, undoubtedly.

First half was good with the youngsters getting some good game time and  showing **some** brilliance, particularly RLC, Oscar and Bertrand Traore (why at LB I will never understand...).  However, when the title winning team came on half way through the match, everything seemed to change, there was a lot less pace in our game going forward and our runs, were lack luster to say the least. I do admit some was due to our opponent becoming very compact, but we lacked an edge that we saw during the earlier stages of the previous season. 
I do understand that this was a preseason fixture that didn't matter to much, but I feel sorry for the fans making their way up to Kings Road to see a win against a team that are inferior. 
I am truly worried for the late kick off on Saturday. 
Ramires is dead wood in our team, and although Mikel is often criticised he should stay as he is a great tactical move in the bigger games. The sooner Ramires is off our books, the better. 
Also, when you look to our bench, who do you see that can change a match, Cuadrado? He is looking under par. We **need** a player - Koke being my first choice [due to the fact he can play across the central midfield] - who can be there to change matches. And some one, like Schurrle, who is natural goal based winger, I regret letting him go. 
Fabregas has to play in a deeper lying role, as he is unable to get on the ball from higher up the pitch, rendering him ineffective. We need our best team out, to not only win, but improve moral on Saturday, the team did looked slightly exasperated. 
Although Mourinho did say his transfer window is over, we desperately need another two players, a LB- seemingly Rahman and an all round midfielder, to replace Ramires.

Unions in general form to collectively bargain for specific workers rights, with the nuclear option of striking, then remain in order to bargain for later, probably lesser rights, but still with the nuclear option. This is all fine if the company can fail. If the company can fail then the workers are incentivised to have some self-restraint viz industrial action because otherwise they shoot themselves in the foot. Example: British Airways. The pilots union took temporary voluntary hours &amp; wages reductions to see it through a tough time. The cabin crew union played hardball &amp; eventually management decided to undercut them by replacing them with a new tier of cabin crew with significantly less rights, with a view of phasing out the current tier.

The government can't do much to fight back against the civil service. I was in 2 CS companies/quangos across 7 years and it was painful how much people knew they were in a cushy position with tons of perks, basically couldn't get fired unless they got caught pissing in the lift (not a theoretical example), and would inevitably get paid better and better if they made diagonal moves because subsequent CS quangos aren't allowed to see your records.

This meant that those companies were bastions of lazy inefficiency, with loads of idle shirkers playing every game in the book to do the least work. The only rebuttal the government has is wage caps, which makes things worse: the worst people stay, the best leave. People's only motivation is to be at their desks vaguely for their hours, and even if not they wouldn't get fired.

This all sucks for teachers, nurses, etc., because this huge swathe of workers with vastly different salaries and jobs are all lumped in together. If the unions could be broken up, teachers and nurses could collectively bargain for their rights better, IMO, because they wouldn't be dragging the idle hides of many thousands of mediocre office workers on cushy wages doing the bare minimum.",null,0,null,1438810153,null,null,false,0,ctstf36,null,t3_3fvatl,null,null,null,t3_3fvatl,null,null,null,1440303922,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Others can be you need to use Universal Jobmatch (the governments job searching tool) five times a week and write something in the 'activity history' each time. The community centre is normally open five days a week but we are occasionally shut due to holidays or we have IT problems and people can't log on.

On these occasions we always inform the local job centre but at least one person was sanctioned as the advisor didn't get the message and noticed the client missed a day (even though we were told to tell the clients as long as they signed the register on site it would be ok)

I also work (and live) in a very poor area and a lot of people who are unemployed can't afford  computer/ broadband so they struggle with accessing the internet, while we help as much as we can we only have limited resources so we can only do so much.

Going on a slight rant now we put on different courses every year which can help people get CSCS cards (to work on a building site), food hygiene certificates  or others to help people improve their chances into work. 

Sometimes these courses are done in a 'block course' for three/four weeks which are designed with a specific industry in mind so for example we had a retail course which focused on customer service skills, interview techniques, going to a local Tesco to see 'behind the scenes' on how they work. (we have to do it like this due to how the training is funded through external sources).

We had a good relationship with the job centre with a understanding that as long as people attended the course every day they would be OK with the job centre as they are greatly improving their chances to work.....The job centre now has a new managed who has decided that claimants can now only do a maximum of 10 days training a year so it ruled a lot of people off the courses and as a consequence we can no longer run the courses as the numbers can't support it.

null,null,xthearcher,CA,canada,null,"**How do you think this season will go?**

After a rather quiet Summer transfer window and several lacklustre performances in preseason fixtures, we enter the season a bit tentatively for reigning champions. That being said, our starting 11 (ignoring any potential injuries â most notably a recurring hamstring issue with Costa) remains unchanged from last yearâs title-winning side, and I think for this reason, we will retain the Premier League. One might question the aging John Terry at the centre of our back line, but with Zouma showing more promise with each appearance, I donât see it being an issue this year. In terms of cups, I think we will make solid runs in both domestic cups, and reach atleast the QF of the Champions League, further progress dependent on the draw.


**Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?**


Without a doubt, Eden Hazard. The reigning Premier League Player of the Year enters his 4th season with Chelsea, each season having been more successful than the last on a goal scoring and general impact front. If his finishing continues to improve, expect to see him bag 20 Premier League goals this season, and 30 in all competitions. 
Honourable mention to Diego Costa â if he can remain fit, he could certainly give Aguero a run for his money for this yearâs Golden Boot. Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on whoâs reading) most of us know, that is a big IF.

**How do you think the team will line-up?**


I expect us to remain unchanged from last yearâs standard starting line-up:

Courtois

IvanovicâCahillâTerryâAzpilicueta 

MaticâFabregas 

WillianâOscarâHazard 

Costa

The same as last. Jose seems to be trusting his core set of players who did romp home with the title last season in fairness, for better or worse. We may see one or two additions of depth but otherwise it's the same team barring a deadline day stroke of genius. Better runs in the champions league and fa cup could well effect league form and force rotation though. A lot may depend on how Costas 80 year old hamstrings hold up. Him being almost practically ruled out for the Swansea game isn't a great start. Whilst we haven't many additions it's still a strong squad that come end of the season will be fighting for the title.

Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?

Hazard. Even on awful games he has the ability to turn three players and put the ball in the net. See Sunderland last year. Can rescue games and put people in on goal like no one else on our team. 

How do you think the team will line up?

Same as last season barring injury. Jose has his core players he trusts and he'll rely on them.

null,null,muonsortsitout,null,null,null,"You could go down Windmill Lane until you get to traffic lights, then turn left onto Old Road and just keep going up to Shotover Hill and either explore that or keep going on Old Road which becomes a track. Ultimately you can get to Wheatley, and you can get a Brookes Bus back. 

Or you can look at Cuckoo Lane, which isn't as pretty as it used to be but is surprisingly quiet given its location. This leads to the University Parks (if you head west from Headington) and if you want a longer walk you can 'turn right' at the river Cherwell and head towards Kidlington. 

It really depends on the length of walk you have in mind, but generally, find a way across the ring road and you are almost immediately in beautiful countryside (probably best to avoid Barton however). 

For a long walk that gets you *really* away from traffic, go to Otmoor, north of Beckley village. This is the landscape which inspired Lewis Caroll's *Through the Looking Glass*, and is an area of about 10 square miles with no roads whatsoever. It's very flat, and can get boggy so use appropriate footwear. The best way to get there on foot from Headington would be down the 'back way' to Marston, via Old High Street and St Andrew's way and Dunstan Way, cross Northway estate and cross the ring road at the MArston interchange. Then to Elsfield, and to Beckly. Stop at the Abingdon Arms for a pint and then go down the hill onto Otmoor. Don't worry too much about the Danger Area, they test artillery there rarely, and make it bloody obvious when they do. Public transport to get back is a bit thin on the ground, though.

I recommend [Open Street Map](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/51.7574/-1.2167) as it shows all the footpaths and bridleways (red and green dashed lines) for planning your walk. Have fun!

EDIT: you might look at the 280 bus route to Aylesbury. Almost anywhere on that route after Wheatley is picture postcard stuff.

This might be completely crap amateur economics from somebody with very little understanding of it all, but that's a really good point. Essentially, isn't something only worth what you can actually sell it for? Even if you have the biggest house in the best location, if nobody wants it or can afford to buy it, then it's probably worth less than you might first imagine, right? As it stands, houses are almost completely unaffordable to a large chunk of young people, and we can only expect that to get worse - so if fewer and fewer people are able to afford something, then surely the price of that thing has to come down to meet what people are able to pay, since people will undercut one another to try and shift their house. This is all just complete speculation and a bit of imagination, but it has to be true that if nobody can afford something then it's not worth its own asking price.

They try to hold back investment in infrastructure at any turn.

[RMT are doing the same thing with normal rail by striking on Great Western because they dared to upgrade the network to have New Hitachi trains that allow the Driver to shut the door instead of having multiple staff on the station to manually shut the doors.](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCYQqQIwAGoVChMIzvupgf-SxwIVI5fbCh1bfQCx&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fuk-33762707&amp;ei=Uo7CVc6KH6Ou7gbb-oGICw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHBohpfUx4iNhKRE8YqYE43da3QuA&amp;sig2=JpdsUl0DRJTUy8peLe4sAQ)

They'd rather millions of commuters get stuck with old out of date trains, if it means they can have redundant staff on the platform to shut doors manually. And these people claim they are on the side of ordinary people and want us to back them? Get out of here with this rubbish.

It's ludicrous. RMT clearly do not care about the normal everyday worker just wanting to get to work or get back to their families, so they shouldn't act surprised when everyone else does not care about their demands either.

I don't care about Tube staffs comfort of living and why should I? As they clearly do not care about millions of others with their repeated attempts to shut down any upgrades to the Tube system or any push for a night service.

RMT NEVER offer an alternative, the options are always ""Give us more money or cancel everything"". 


This is the 21st Century, either RMT accept the fact that London wants a night tube service and an upgraded Tube network or they accept the fact that they will be made obsolete by technology at a faster pace as the calls for an end to their constant striking rises.

Who suffers as a result of these strikes?  Wealthy people who can afford private cabs or ordinary workers who rely on the tube to get to work and back?


Anyone who supports these tube strikes does not care about normal people and ordinary workers, and they are out of touch with reality.

No teams have strikers of equal level. That's insane. They'd get pissed off. None of the top teams in the world too that's a pointless comment to make as everyone has the same. It's not an issue.

We'll sign cover, looks like ake seems to be staying as well so that's two. If we sign rahman and stones that's four. Perhaps it's a little slow but there will be. Begovic is the best replacement we could have got, can't replace cech. Was the best reserve keeper in the world. 

Also it's pre season. Won the league under carlo after not winning a game. It's about getting fit not winning games. They're friendlies who cares? We won games despite not playing as lovely football. That's what was important. Good teams win if they're not playing amazing and it's a trait of a Jose team. Don't care if we win by one or four goals. Still won. So if we continue like last season we'll win the league by your logic. Well done mate. Done yourself there.

If by considerably you mean arsenal signing one player and city 2, you're talking bollocks. Liverpool will do well to finish top 4 and uniteds squad still isn't as good as ours.

Budget are designed to last until the next payment hits maybe with a small amount of wiggle room. 

All it takes is one person, in a very labour intensive system, to get a dose of slopey shoulders (or the call centre to send an e-mail to someone on holiday) and suddenly that fortnightly budget has to stretch for an indeterminate amount of time whilst you try to get someone to notice the machine is on autopilot and in a nose dive. 

Whilst food banks and such can, in theory, be accessed when this happens it's knowing enough about the systems the DWP have (and being outright cynical enough to believe it's happening) to spot the nose dive and get yourself hunkered down.  The vast, vast majority of benefits claimants don't realise how easy it is for the DWP to mess up like this or how long it takes to fight a sanction and so when it does happen... the wheels come off.

null,null,djimonia,lfc99,,null,"Interestingly, considering he played wide all of last season for City, Milner has one of the highest per 90 tackle rates (~2.5), putting him in the top 20 alongside central midfielders. He has understandably poorer completion and interception stats given wide midfielders make riskier passes and have less chances to intercept passes in the channels (especially when lined up in a 4-4-2 which encourages crossing and hugging the touchline respectively). If he can translate some of that bite to the holding midfield position, he might actually do well. We lose his quality going forward (and he needs to be disciplined about this) but it may be a good sacrifice. It's a bit like Gerrard 2.0 all over again, obviously less world class but Milner has more legs than Gerrard and that might make all the difference. 

Henderson is a poorer holding midfielder and plays better/contributes more on the front foot (pressing the midfield in defence and making runs forward to support attacks) so Milner will have to be the one sitting deeper. I suspect it will be a bit of Gerrard/Lampard at times, but it may also turn out to be a bit of Carrick/Scholes...

First half was very dissapointing, RLC has a long long long way to go before you see him start for Chelsea in any important games. His movement off the ball is lackluster, his tackles were late and sloppy and he seems to trip over his own gangly legs quite a bit.

Cuadrado, another dissapointment. He was standing in acres of space all the time, but thats just it, he just stands still. He doesnt call for the ball, he rarely made his precense known but hes very fast and a keen tackler. He is the least vocal player, maybe its the language barrier.

Aina was the most impressive player of the whole match. First time I have ever seen him play, he stood out for everyone that went with our group.

Hazard was mostly invisible, you can tell he doesnt really care for these preseason games, the result means nothing for him, especially if hes only playing for 20 minutes.

Matic was the difference maker for the second half, he is definately one of the reasons we took charge in the second half.

From watching with my own eyes front row at the Bridge it is obvious that none of our players are comfortable with taking on shots from outside the box. The best effort came from the young RB Aina that was playing first half.

null,null,thehandsomelyraven,present,,null,"""How do you think this season will go""

If you were to look at our squad at the beginning of last season against the beginning of this campaign the most alarming thing is the loss of some quality players. Most notably Schurrle who was, a solid option on either wing. Not only have we lost depth, but what I think we are missing most is players that can change our approach options. It's important for a club to have a style, and even more important for them to execute it efficiently. But since last February we've been forced to play a brand of football that is clearly not one that is conducive to any longevity. Our poor form from the end of the last season is bound to continue as there will not be any large changes to the starting XI. 

""Star Player"" 

Hazard is the obvious answer, but it isn't mine. If Costa is not firing on all cylinders our attack is totally toothless. While I'll defend Oscar's *ability* as a finisher, our only natural finisher is Costa. Hazard is becoming more of a playmaker than a goal scoring winger. Costa's form is pivotal to our success. 

""Line up""

Mourinho is in a damned if you do, damned if you don't position. He was being pressured to promote youth and nurture talent within the club, but now is being called on to make some moves in the transfer market. The lineup will be exactly the same as last year. Occasionally you'll see Fabregas in the midfield 3 and Ramires or Mikel in the pivot with Matic for the big games.

This is slightly blowing smoke up their ass, but being obvious about it let's them know you've done your due diligence. Have a topic of recent news/developments in the relevant field to discuss, have an opinion on it and question theirs.

3) Be positive and enthusiastic. about yourself, your past, them, everything. you're basically a cheerleader for a few hours but leave the poms poms at home. view the interview as an opportunity that you are appreciative of, don't worry about the outcome, just focus on you, beyond that it's up to them. the more comfortable you are, the less adversarial the process will seem, and more about discovering mutual compatibility.

4) Be complimentary, affable, set other interviewees at ease, this highlights your own sense of finesse and class.

5) they will probably ask you about working to deadlines, working with others, handling the unknown. have precise examples ready from your past.

6) stress that you are eager and passionate to improve and learn. with this, flaws become strengths.

null,null,elmo298,null,null,null,"Yeah basically you're completely right. In this example someone wants to sell a house. Now this house is a four bedroom detached house that's worth 375,000 in a town. However it is situated 10 mins from town and there are more houses closer so now it is less desirable and is finally sold at 225,000. The reason being is that it can be valued, like any object or commodity, for a certain price. But at the end of the day people will only ever pay 1) what they can afford and 2) what they think it's worth to them 3) availability 
. Now if any of these aren't there then that commodity is never sold. This drives the price down. 

So in the case we have atm, conservatives don't build houses as it drives prices down due to reduced scarcity, increased affordability and the percieved value of a house decreases. This caters for their voters, especially the elderly. However it can create a bubble where suddenly it's all too high, no one affords houses and prices plummet, this causes an increase in selling too as people want to keep their money they put in, but acts as a positive-feedback and further drives prices down.

Now if you increase the supply their house prices will fall, but more people will be able to afford houses and will be sustainable in the future.

We did the usual stuff - had a good long look at the bridge, grabbed something to eat in Tu Hwnt i'r Bont, walked along the river.

I was dimly aware, however, that the church housed the sarcophagus of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, known to history as Llywelyn the Great, so we went in search of it. It's not easy to find - being surrounded by later buildings on the bank of the river. It's a lovely building though, and surprisingly large and sumptuous for such a small town. At the far end of the nave is a side door into the Gwydir Chapel, a Tudor addition to the church, built by the Wynn family. The Wynns were powerful local landowners, and frequently pop up in histories of the wider British state. They can also, almost uniquely, trace their ancestry back to the House of Aberffraw - the ruling house of Gwynedd in Llywelyn's day.

That heritage is plastered all over the chapel.

In any other country, this would be a major tourist attraction. Llywelyn is Wales' equivalent of Alfred or Charlemagne: he arguably did more than any other person in our history to develop Welsh nationood. He was the first individual to hold the position (if not the title) of Prince of Wales. He struggled with King John for primacy in Wales, and came out on top. He was a patron of the arts, overseeing a great expansion in monastic life in Wales. He was quite the builder: many of the castles that now dot the landscapes of Gwynedd - Criccieth, Dolwyddelan, Y Bere, Dolbadarn - are his. He was even active in the politics of England, allying himself with the Barons under Simon de Montfort, and was present at the signing of the Magna Carta.

However, this is Wales. The church is clearly unable to properly maintain the chapel properly - there's a smell of damp about the place and it's in desperate need of a good clean. There is nothing, save an info board in the entrance of the church (which is hard to find in the first place), to point tourists and day trippers to the chapel, which is quite a sight on its own merits notwithstanding the artefacts contained within ([look at the ceiling!](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nickkaye/8046479586/in/photolist-dg3j3E-dg3hk2-dg3j9y-dg3eTv-dg3gX1-dg3gKU-dg3hEd-dg3iDm-dg3gVt-dg3iJW-dg3gy8-dg3hLh-dg3g7t-dg3ftB-dg3g1D-dg3fhp-dg3hmb-s2d1ZM-5QnbxM-79zm3N-s23RwW-s24NBh-s23KBQ-rmDzef-rmQyxn-sgmaxA-8e7X78-8ebeWC-8e7Ypg-6F5iRC-6F19Nr-6F19Rp-6F5ivU-6F5iLf-6F19UZ-6F5it5-56A8CD-4MHLKm-4MDzfM-55AjxN-4MHLWQ-55JGJe-4MHRZN-55w3MD-55vHBp-55J8vX-55J8w6-55J8vZ-55w3Mp-55NyCE)). Very few people seem to be aware that Llywelyn's coffin is in there. Even the pool of people who know who Llywelyn *was* is small enough.

The grand Edwardian Castles along the coast of North Wales are lauded, and rightly so. They are magnificent examples of medieval fortresses that are almost without equal in Europe. Yet they remain glorious monuments to our submission. Seems to me we should be more appreciative of our *own* history, too - not the history of the Romans, the Saxons, the Normans *in* Wales, but *our* history. The history of the Welsh people. Not just the Princes and their castles but the saints, the sinners, the traitors and the rioters, the philosophers and the scientists, the chartists and the socialists, the farmers and the labourers. Seems to me almost every aspect of Welsh historiography is woefully neglected save that of our conquerors, and that's an awful shame.",null,0,null,1438818606,null,null,false,0,ctsyyzc,null,t3_3fxngl,null,null,null,t3_3fxngl,null,null,null,1440306604,null,3,null,HistoryWales,t5_33hgc,3,null

One routinely disagrees with lecturers and seminar leaders, and is expected to tell them as such, and more importantly WHY one disagrees. To formulate an opinion based around the arguments you have put together from research you have conducted yourself and sources you have analysed yourself.  
When it came to political discussion in Japan, the effect of the education system, even with regards to students who actually studied politics was either 'my teacher hasn't taught us that yet', or even worse 'my teacher says this'.  
You don't study politics to regurgitate what someone else says.

I must admit that this article, short though it is, really struck a chord with me. A couple of weeks back I visited Llanrwst in the Conwy Valley. We did the usual stuff - had a good long look at the bridge, grabbed something to eat in Tu Hwnt i'r Bont, walked along the river.

I was dimly aware, however, that the church housed the sarcophagus of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, known to history as Llywelyn the Great, so we went in search of it. It's not easy to find - being surrounded by later buildings on the bank of the river. It's a lovely building though, and surprisingly large and sumptuous for such a small town. At the far end of the nave is a side door into the Gwydir Chapel, a Tudor addition to the church, built by the Wynn family. The Wynns were powerful local landowners, and frequently pop up in histories of the wider British state. They can also, almost uniquely, trace their ancestry back to the House of Aberffraw - the ruling house of Gwynedd in Llywelyn's day.

That heritage is plastered all over the chapel. The original Tudor [wood panelling](https://www.flickr.com/photos/roj/8111137732/in/photolist-dmKGEh-qY3vuM-dmKCTy-dmKgSE-4HFay2-56ijLZ-dmKvuV-dmKJ4B-dmKqjA-dmKQ12-dmKmB4-dmKyA8-4HFbND-4HKr2S-rDfizN-osLWwa-dmKtXS-55vHBk-2Vme3u-55Jehe-2VgRLn-2VgRCt-2Vme5J-2Vmefd-2Vmeoh-u58mPP-qsULc3-o4t4a4-2VgRxR-55Jehc-55Jeh6-55JegX-6rFpv8-dg3bcK-dg3df7-55zD9S-pezpt5-oH7JVq-5Qn3xH-5Qn3xx-97c2Yv-97f83N-cSPm7u-8fBjcc-8fEyKf-8fBiGp-8fEyDG-8fBiPT-owFodT-69whxx) is surmounted by the arms of Owain Gwynedd and Llywelyn the Last.

In any other country, this would be a major tourist attraction. Llywelyn is Wales' equivalent of Alfred or Charlemagne: he arguably did more than any other person in our history to develop Welsh nationood. He was the first individual to hold the position (if not the title) of Prince of Wales. He struggled with King John for primacy in Wales, and came out on top. He was a patron of the arts, overseeing a great expansion in monastic life in Wales. He was quite the builder: many of the castles that now dot the landscapes of Gwynedd - Criccieth, Dolwyddelan, Y Bere, Dolbadarn - are his. He was even active in the politics of England, allying himself with the Barons under Simon de Montfort, and was present at the signing of the Magna Carta.

However, this is Wales. The church is clearly unable to properly maintain the chapel properly - there's a smell of damp about the place and it's in desperate need of a good clean. There is nothing, save an info board in the entrance of the church (which is hard to find in the first place), to point tourists and day trippers to the chapel, which is quite a sight on its own merits notwithstanding the artefacts contained within ([look at the ceiling!](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nickkaye/8046479586/in/photolist-dg3j3E-dg3hk2-dg3j9y-dg3eTv-dg3gX1-dg3gKU-dg3hEd-dg3iDm-dg3gVt-dg3iJW-dg3gy8-dg3hLh-dg3g7t-dg3ftB-dg3g1D-dg3fhp-dg3hmb-s2d1ZM-5QnbxM-79zm3N-s23RwW-s24NBh-s23KBQ-rmDzef-rmQyxn-sgmaxA-8e7X78-8ebeWC-8e7Ypg-6F5iRC-6F19Nr-6F19Rp-6F5ivU-6F5iLf-6F19UZ-6F5it5-56A8CD-4MHLKm-4MDzfM-55AjxN-4MHLWQ-55JGJe-4MHRZN-55w3MD-55vHBp-55J8vX-55J8w6-55J8vZ-55w3Mp-55NyCE)). Very few people seem to be aware that Llywelyn's coffin is in there. Even the pool of people who know who Llywelyn *was* is small enough.

The grand Edwardian Castles along the coast of North Wales are lauded, and rightly so. They are magnificent examples of medieval fortresses that are almost without equal in Europe. Yet they remain glorious monuments to our submission. Seems to me we should be more appreciative of our *own* history, too - not the history of the Romans, the Saxons, the Normans *in* Wales, but *our* history. The history of the Welsh people. Not just the Princes and their castles but the saints, the sinners, the traitors and the rioters, the philosophers and the scientists, the chartists and the socialists, the farmers and the labourers. Seems to me almost every aspect of Welsh historiography is woefully neglected save that of our conquerors, and that's an awful shame.",null,0,null,1438818947,null,null,false,0,ctsz6l3,null,t3_3fxvs3,null,null,null,t3_3fxvs3,null,null,null,1440306703,null,11,null,Wales,t5_2qhrl,11,null

I have to say it depends on a couple of things that are out of our control, which is scary. While last year we felt like kings of the Premier League since day 1, this year is a bit more worrying. Costa's hamstring seems to become more of a problem every day and although Remy has proved that he can be a goalscoring threat, at times he looks lost on the pitch. In terms of positives, Mourinho backs Oscar to have a break out season this year, Willian has looked more dangerous than ever, and we still have the best defense in the league. If we can avoid injury, I fully expect us to repeat as champions and hopefully make a strong champions league push. 


**Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?**

For me it's gotta be Willian. In the Community Shield we saw Arsenal effectively take Hazard out of the game and that may be a recurring theme this year, giving Willian the opportunity to work his magic on the right side. If he can work on his final product I can see him becoming one of the most dangerous wingers in the league (although it would probably relegate Ivanovic to a more defensive role). 

**How do you think the team will line up?**

Same as last year, why fix what isn't broken. Probably expect to see even more of Zouma and maybe (maybe!) some rotation for our wingers now that we have Moses back.

If you want more balanced content stick to the ""New"" filter where the un/r/UK opinions don't pick up. If they are posted. I won't say that I do that often as I don't. I go to other subs to see such opinions in which they are often discussed. I, here, more often react to threads and responses which seem harshly unfair. I target the ones that get seen. Many people have left this place due to the momentum of certain attitudes which only promote, via upvotes, self soothing content. It's blame on both parties though for perpetually reassuring the established opinion. I guess, however, that the status quo is hard to topple.

I often try to add a balance to certain topics due to it being a national standard sub. I don't want newcomers to be drawn into this narrow scope of discussion. It often results in bad karma (some attitudes feel unconditionally downvoted or are just not up). If, though, the comments are nearer to the bottom of the thread my points on occasion go positive so I know that there are a few more resilient like minded people out there.

Wouldn't it be cool if everyone upvoted which they hated and downvoted which they didn't? The more unpopular the opinion the more consideration it got... in theory.

&gt; set up a business account for my wages. **They claim my wages from my agency which is transferred into this bank account.**

The way this works is that the agency is based in Jersey, or some other tax haven. And because they're not UK based they don't pay anywhere near the amount of taxes.

This allows an individual to work in the UK and pay the much lower tax rate of another country, and ""lend"" the money back to themselves. It's tax ""avoidance"", but not technically ""evasion"".

http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2162245/The-tricks-British-celebrities-use-pay-tax.html

&gt; The way that K2 and similar schemes work is remarkably simple. Its members redirect their earnings into a Jersey-based trust. The trust then grants interest-free or low-interest loans to members, on which little or no tax is payable. The borrowers then quietly 'forget' to repay these loans, which the trust later writes off against the earnings it holds. 

These schemes aren't only available to celebrities. Many accountancy firms do this for regular people because they can take half the money saved.

If someone applies for basic income, pay their utility bills (within reason*) and pay them a basic rate of Â£40 a week.

*Obviously there are going to be who try to abuse this, but we can deal with that on a case by case basis as a large increase in usage would be easy to spot.

If people are on a basic income we can massively reduce the number of people employed at the job centre. It's not just the initial wages cost of these employees, it's also pensions and employer contributions, buildings costs, etc.

If the government wanted to save large amounts of money on the unemployed and actually be efficient, sadly, a lot of people who currently work at job centres are going to have to lose their jobs. But if we never progressed and strived for efficiency because people protested at losing their jobs, we would all still be riding horses.

Now, this is not likely to happen within the foreseeable future because of 2 main reasons 1) The media would kick up a shitstorm of ""giving people free money, those bloody scroungers"". And 2) The media and the unions would kick up a shitstorm over large job losses.

It doesn't matter that this would save a massive amount of money and be far more efficient. The people who are able to implement this are too swayed by an emotional public and the fear of being voted out if they try to do anything that helps. If you want a citation for this you only have to look at pension reform. Any mention of pensions being reduced causes massive outrage, because pensioners vote.

They're wrong to liken us to an old aristocrat with a crumbling house however, that's the team on the other side of Glasgow.

Since nearly going under in the 90s we've spent only what we could afford and moved on players for profit to keep things ticking over. We're in 10x the position of your average debt-laden Premiership side who are reliant on an over-inflated bubble of TV money to keep their heads just above the water.

null,null,Moronicmongol,null,null,null,"But if we look at the world as it actually exists today we really see no difference between private and public centres of power. They are so interconnected it's hard to really see a difference. The recent revelation of the huge subsidies provided by the state to the fossil fuels industry, accelerating environmental concerns is one of the latest in a long line of private and public co-dependence. 

As you say the state has a monopoly on violence. Limiting myself to domestic violence, the state brutally suppresses the extraneous population with unjust drugs laws then and provides cheap labour for industry while simultaneously suppressing wages for the rest. Well that's the way it functions today. It also functions as a tool of violence for big business, it's essential function; to vehemently protect private property. 

So private enterprise absolutely depends on the state to function. Without a state ( which at least has some modicum of democratic accountability, unlike large corporations) it would implode as the mechanism at heart is to maximise profit for short term gain. It seems idealistic to believe competition will prevent this and for good reasons. Big business hates competition, it will do it's utmost to prevent competition; it wants a monopoly. Which is what we see again if we look at the world, large unaccountable monopolies that don't innovate all that much. 

For example, look at projects like Wikipedia community created projects that are indispensable. ",null,0,null,1438824781,null,null,false,0,ctt2qxl,null,t3_3fmhnw,null,null,null,t1_ctscup4,null,null,null,1440308448,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null
