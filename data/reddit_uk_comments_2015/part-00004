This would force private landlords to be both cheaper and better at their responsibilities, because otherwise their tenants will just go to the better council offered service instead. 


there are problems with this - notably the number you'd need to build in places like london to compete successfully, but there definitely needs to be some way of enforcing landlords to provide an acceptable service, because the vast majority of them do not!

null,false,fragglet,null,null,null,"The two qualities of British humour that stand out for me are:

1: Biting sarcasm, which often expresses itself in the form of satire and ridicule. One simple example that springs to mind is [Not the Nine O'Clock News's piece on ""Python Worshippers""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asUyK6JWt9U) during the controversy over Life of Brian. Satire of all kinds is an established British pastime: go and buy yourself a copy of Private Eye if you've never read it for example. 

It's worth remembering that sarcasm is something that for us Brits is a common everyday occurrence, to the extent that it's common to see advice given in this subreddit to people moving to the UK, that the one thing they should never assume is that anything said to them is serious. 

British comedy tends to value wit and intelligence over the ability to simply tell jokes, which perhaps explains the abundance of TV panel shows, a uniquely British phenomenon (as far as I can tell) that exemplifies this quality. Panel shows are a format where participants die on stage if they don't have the wit to hold their own.

2: Childish absurdity, for want of a better term to describe it. Chaotic nonsense, of which Monty Python is the obvious and best example, but it's an extreme example and there are many others that lie on that same spectrum. Most sketch shows tend to embody this quality and it's rare that there isn't at least one such sketch show on TV at any given time.

It's common for sitcoms to sort of ""channel"" this insanity into a more easily-digestible form: look at *Fawlty Towers* or *One Foot in the Grave* for examples of shows with a serious tone but an underlying theme of mayhem and insanity to them. Most British sitcoms have it to some extent. British sitcoms tend to value absurd situations and plotlines rather than witty one-liners and jokes.

The British character is inherently reserved, so I personally wonder if we find this stuff funny because it inherently crosses some kind of line that we could never cross ourselves.

For me, the best shows are those that blend these two properties together. So for example:

* *Blackadder*: historical satire with absurd characters and situations that ridicule our own history.

* Chris Morris's *Brass Eye*, a parody of news programmes, rather than of news events in particular. Brass Eye is the pinnacle of Morris's oeuvre after a decade of having made similar shows, expertly mocking the hysterical mainstream press.

* *Spitting Image*: Chaotic 80s political satire done with puppets. 'nuff said.

* Peter Serafinowicz's *Look Around You*, a deadpan satire of '70s/'80s educational films that perfectly recreates their style. Every one of us was forced to watch these shows when we were in school, except that Look Around You's purpose is to teach absurd falsehoods.",null,0,null,1420377685,null,0,1420378167,0,cne2jp5,null,t3_2rancd,null,t1_cne2jp5,null,t3_2rancd,null,null,null,1425066192,null,26,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,26,null

The market can't work properly when the supplier profits from doing something other than selling stuff their customers want to buy. 

Property developers make their money from planning conversions. They don't make much from actually building and selling houses. So while house prices are appreciating it's better for them to hang on to their land banks. Counter-intuitively, falling house prices would make the property developers cash out by building and selling houses. 

This is exacerbated by low interest rates and low returns on other investments. Also large property developers have the resources to navigate the planning process, but smaller would-be competitors don't, which creates barriers to entry. 

IMO a planning system which creates perverse incentives and which raises barriers to competition is broken. So many people make money out of it that I expect it will be difficult to fix though.

Property ownership is (often) more expensive than rent and will have a number of unforeseen expenses. **Do not purchase a property using 100% of your savings**. An emergency fund is a requirement for secure personal finances, an emergency fund is an **absolute necessity** when you own property: if you don't have a ~3 month (minimum) emergency fund then purchasing a property would be grossly irresponsible, because surprise costs *will* crop up.

Purchasing a Â£200,000 property with a joint salary of Â£44,000 would be really stretching what you can afford -- and you might struggle to get a mortgage for that much -- you'd be much more comfortable if you went for a house around Â£150,000. If you want to find out what your best options for a mortgage are you should talk to a mortgage broker, your personal circumstance (which compromises of far more than you've included here) is very important and a mortgage broker would have access to all that information.

The equity loan is repaid from sale price. For example if you pay Â£200,000 for a house with a Â£40,000 government loan, Â£10,000 from you (deposit) and a Â£150,000 mortgage, and then 2 years later sell the house for Â£200,000 you would repay the outstanding mortgage (a bit under Â£150,000 because of your repayments), then the equity loan (Â£40,000) and then any money left over (your ""equity"" (comprising of your 5% deposit, and any repayments on the mortgage)) would be yours to keep after costs. What you're thinking about is being in [negative equity or ""underwater""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_equity) on a mortgage, which only *normally* happens if your house value drops (it used to be the case that people would get 120% mortgages and be underwater the moment they bought the property but they're long since gone now).

You should read through the Help To Buy website: http://www.helptobuy.org.uk/equity-loan/equity-loans

&gt; I am assuming buying a house is the best use of the money in our situation, but open to discussion on this.

Whether or not it's the ""best"" decision is far more complex than ""renting is wasted money so we should buy"". Do you want to commit yourself to living with your brother for the next 5 years (if you're outside of a property ""hot spot"" that's roughly the minimum period you need to be able to sell a property without losses after all of the costs...)?

I'd say all of the above showcase British comedy really really well. They all share similar elements: touches of seriousness and subtle darkness, and they are all slightly exaggerated versions of the ""real world"", but with hints of chaos and the sense that we're not in control. Most of the situations our characters find themselves in derive from misunderstandings or complex and chaotic series of events. You'll find most British comedies are grounded in real life though, which, IMO, makes them all that much better because you can identify with the characters and situations. 

Though you'll notice most of the above comedies were from the 1960s - 1980s period..which was in my opinion the ""golden age"" of British Comedy. Not to say that there aren't any good modern British comedies (I absolutely love The Office), but I do think that modern comedies lack the subtlety that really defined British humour.

They certainly exist as a cost and have to be met, and there is a tendency for trusts to either cut the value of contracts with providers or attempt to shift to lower tariff activity somehow in face of PFI costs kicking in. Or just sit in the red.  

&gt; second is how much more strain would the NHS be under if that investment was not there. An old hospital with old equipment is incredibly expensive.

That will depend on circumstances of whether the facilities were needed in totality (the odd trust have subsequently come out and said unnecessary facilities were foisted on them), whether the same effect could have been achieved merely by replacing equipment or whether there would have been less of a burden on the trust had the funding come from central government. The problem people have with PFI is that it is up to the trust to repay it, and that the contracts are poor value for money.

I would visit the BRITISH Broadcasting Company's website for information about BRITISH football. I have no problem with seeing posts from Spain, Germany and Italy, but don't shove it in my face every time I click on the sports page.

Another reason I prefer SkySports is that they focus more on English clubs, especially the smaller ones. There's a huge disparity between them.

If there aren't any student hosueshares, you'll be able to find a private houseshare through a letting agent.

null,false,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,null,"The issue is complex. Property ownership is cheaper over the long term than renting in *most* places, but your own residential property ownership should not form the majority of your long term financial plan. You should be contributing the minimum into your pension to achieve the full match (otherwise you're choosing not to have free money -- if they match up to 5%, contribute 5%) but a pension is just one part of a healthy financial plan.

If you are confident you are going to stay in the same area for a long period of time (5 minimum, 10+ years ideally) then property ownership is *more often than not* the right financial choice, but property ownership over a short period of time (just a few years) can result in losses, especially because you may purchase a property that requires you funnel money into it (repairs, upgrades). If you purchase a property and remain there for many years you insulate yourself from house price volitility (in general house prices are always higher than they were 10 years ago) and you 
don't spend a lot of money on fees. For example at the start of a mortgage the capital portion of your mortgage is going to be so low that it would take *at least* 2 - 3 years to cover the fees you've paid for buying (and selling) the property.

1. Pay into your pension as much as you need to to achieve the maximum match (if you're a 20% tax payer it's probably best you don't pay in *more* than that)
2. Save money towards a deposit on a house
3. Save money towards an emergency fund
4. Save money to invest in your future outside of a pension

However lets look at the views of the so called 'no one else' as you have unconsciously stated.

âRent control has in certain Western countries constituted, maybe, the worst example of poor planning by governments lacking courage and vision.â - Gunnar Myrdal, Left-wing Swedish economist, Nobel laurate and politician as well as architect of the Swedish welfare state.

âIn many cases rent control appears to be the most efficient technique presently known to destroy a cityâexcept for bombing.â - Assar Lindbeck, Socialist Swedish Economist

""The Americans couldn't destroy Hanoi, but we have destroyed our city by very low rents. We realized it was stupid and that we must change policy."" - Nguyá»n CÆ¡ Tháº¡ch, Foreign Minister of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam

[Out of a surveyed 484 economists in the 1990's, 94% agree, of that 16.6% with provisos that âa ceiling on rents reduces the quantity and quality of housing available.â](http://www.weber.edu/wsuimages/AcademicAffairs/ProvostItems/global.pdf)

[William Tucker of the Cato Institute also found that ""that the advertised rents of available apartments in rent-regulated cities are dramatically higher than they are in cities without rent control."" when surveying 18 cities in North America.](http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-274.html)

A thirty year government loan on a social housing property would be cheaper than paying the housing benefit for the same period.

You're making huge assumptions, such as that the government would be able to arrange to build the right number of houses, for a good price, in the right place.

Its also far from clear that 30 years of housing benefit is more expensive. Say your giving a tenant Â£400/mo housing benefit for a 1-bed flat that's worth Â£70k, and instead provide them with the same flat that cost Â£70k but for free.

Over 30 years, you will give that tenant Â£144000 in benefit. Current UK gov borrowing rate is about 2.5%/year, which is Â£1400/year.  That's Â£42000 over 30 years, plus the Â£70k flat = Â£112k.

Ease planning regulation.  The market wants to build houses, but there is too much red tape.  I mean, who wouldn't *want* to build houses?  Look at how expensive they are, there is a lot of money to be made!  The problem is that the state is making it prohibitively difficult to do so.

&gt;Why won't anyone do it

House prices are now inexplicably linked to prosperity.  High house prices equals good times, apparently.  

&gt;What can we do?

Labour/Cons/Greens have no interest in doing anything to actually solve the problem, only to make it look like they are doing something (perfect example:  help2buy literally only serves to increase house prices, a complete joke of a policy).

There are more people wanting to buy houses in London than there are houses in London.  That *cannot* be solved by forcing the price down.  It will not magically build more space.

- China, with state controlled churches, and state controlled bible publishing? Limiting independent churches to 15 people? It also happens to be no. 37 on Open doors list of countries that persecute Christians.

I wouldn't really count the Nordic countries as Socialist counties either, strong left politics of course but not the same league as the other three mentioned. Although Norway did reduce the states control over the state church recently.

I never said they were good tacticians.

The completely massive gulf between housing need and the houses we now have available however means that everyone struggles for housing. Council housing is no longer really a route for the average person who needs a home but can't afford one - it's near enough emergency housing.

For one thing, we've been through a comical amount of managers in the past 20 or so years (I could be wrong, but I seem to think that we've had more managers than any other club in England in the period since Clough left), and that's done us no good at all. What we're crying out for is a bit of managerial stability - give someone a chance to build a team, and a club, rather than simply tinkering with whatever the previous manager had left for them. Pearce is level-headed, and that's exactly the kind of figure that we need right now.

For another thing, with the embargo in place, I'm not sure what sort of manager we could attract in anyway (who would want to come to a club where they are basically unable to strengthen for the next year or so?), let alone what good they could actually do.

I think they figured I'd be out of their hair in a very short time (as it happens, they were right) and they needn't bother paying too much attention to me. Lots of other people might have been in for longer stints, and thus to get them off the books they figured they had to use harder measures. It's an awful system where the task of Jobcentre is to get people off the books by any means necessary. It should be about finding suitable, stable, decent employment and training for people, in roles they are suited, not any old crap that comes along.

But if we are struggling for width, a 3rd round FA Cup game might be the perfect time to try him on the left as a straight forward winger, rather than being exclusively an inverted winger. Great thing about Poch's system is that the attacking midfield play off each other and swap between left right and the middle so he wont get stuck there too. He can play there too. He used to play in the center until Totti pushed him to the right but he did have some time on the left.

You are right though. If he plays then he'll probably been on the right. However I personally think it's worth trying to mix it up and see how it works out. Perfect time to experiment.

Personally I found The Office tremendously bleak: it's a comedy about a bunch of office workers working for a shitty paper company in a shitty town in shitty jobs, with no ambition even though most of them could go onto better things in life, led by a man who has a serious inferiority complex. 

The end of the series (discounting the Christmas special), has the one genuine relationship between Dawn and Tim ending with her going off to California to be with a deadbeat boyfriend, and Tim, the one capable and relatable character in the show, realising he will likely be stuck in this deadend job for the rest of his life, and David Brent in tears begging not to be fired because he realises his job is the only real thing he has left in his life.

I found the end of One Foot in the Grave to be pretty awful too, with the main character, Victor Meldrew, dead from a pointless hit-and-run and his wife Margaret about to kill his killer.

And when you think about it, Waiting for God is about a world famous war photographer reduced to having to stay in a rundown retirement home, as she has no family and no one left to care for her; and Tom who has a family who mostly genuinely hate him and hate coming to visit him. The main characters are literally ""waiting for God"", or, waiting to die, as they have nothing left in the world. The establishment also exemplifies the worst of geriatric care in this country and you could probably replace the retirement home with the various retirement home scandals we get in the news every couple of months.

2. Dependent on exchange rates.

5. Taxable at your income tax rate, so either 20% or 40%. This is a big one.
6. Takes time to sell.
7. Costs money to sell.

Any capital gains may also be taxable (unsure as to how that works between the UK and overseas properties, but I expect you'd see the same tax).

*Spearhead From Space (the first 3rd Doctor episode, 4 episodes)
*Genesis of the Daleks (4th Doctor, one of the best classice episodes, also provides backstory on the Daleks' creation, 6 episodes)
*Pyramids of Mars (also 4th, my favourite episode, 4 episodes)

At the same time it's difficult to perform well consistently in a shit team - it's a trap basically.

I think there's a truth hidden there somewhere but you've got it a little backwards. The working class and immigrants both end up in the same areas. Tension between them and the neighbouring middle class breeds prejudice that the media nurture. It would be easy to think it's some sort of coordinated effort to distract the public. More likely is the reality that they are an easy target to build a narrative the public can understand in a world where things are increasingly complicated. 

I think working class people suffer at the hands of poor integration. A situation that the left sort of ignores and is difficult to tackle with the Conservative attitude of personal responsibility. 

&gt;As it stands, people resent paying higher taxes to disproportinately benefit people they don't recognise as part of they're ""tribe"" or in-group. It's deeply rooted in human nature.

There is absolutely no evidence of this though.

The decidedly unpleasant Epstein character at the centre of all this ought to be in prison, undoubtedly. How exactly he managed to *avoid* it for 'paying for' sex with a 14 year old (or **having** sex with a 14 year old, or even just *pursuing* sex with a 14 year old) is beyond me, but all that demonstrates is that Andrew has terrible taste in friends.

Refusing to immediately treat every accusation of rape as confirmed fact is not 'Victim blaming.' If she *was* in fact being compelled as some sort of sex slave, and she *was* pimped out to Prince Andrew and he *did* know that she was being treated as such and he *did* force himself on her without consent, then it's absolutely awful and the sky (and legal system) should fall on his head.

The problem is that *absolutely none of that* is confirmed, and the manner in which she presents **herself** in the interview is considerably more supportive of the more common ""Teenage gold digger has regrets after millionaire sugar daddy moves on to new toy"" narrative suggested by Dershowitz.

Note please, even if she was a star-struck groupie who threw *herself* at rich and famous people and the entire 'sex slave' thing is a complete fabrication, the sky should **still** fall on Andrew if he raped her - but as yet we have nothing except the allegations of one young woman who has declined to repeat them when challenged to do so under oath.",null,0,null,1420395185,null,0,false,0,cne95qf,null,t3_2rai8g,null,t1_cne95qf,null,t1_cne64pj,null,null,null,1425063061,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

No state in the mainland comes close to either territory's rate. The highest rates recorded in 2011 were in Washington, D.C., at 17.5 homicides per 100,000 people, and in Louisiana, with a rate of 11.2, according to the FBI data.

The territory's 2012 rate of 56 homicides per 100,000 people is also among the highest in the world, according to 2011 figures from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The U.N. statistics track only ""intentional homicide,"" defined as any ""unlawful death purposefully inflicted on a person by another person."" Removing vehicular homicides from the Virgin Islands' rate to adjust for that difference, the territory's rate would be at 50.4 in 2012.

The only countries with clearly higher rates were Honduras, with 91.6 homicides per 100,000 people in 2011, and El Salvador, with 69.2 homicides per 100,000 people in 2011, according to the U.N. data. The territory's rate also would be in the same ballpark as Cote d'Ivoire, which last reported a homicide rate in 2008, at which point it was 56.9 per 100,000 people.

Of course the Polish people who come to the UK are a specific subset of the Polish population. You won't see Polish people with good education, a house, job and family come over to the UK. Many Polish immigrants in the UK are the Polish equivalent of chavs.

That said, I think part of your observations is true for the Poles in general. I think Polish people, even in Poland, do tend to smile less than the British. On the other hand, from a Polish perspective, the English are often perceived as shallow or fake, for smiling or seeming friendly without meaning it.

The queuing think is a bit tricky. Polish people tend to be serious about queues, but their queues work different from the British queues. British queues are usually perpendicular to the counter, while Polish queues are [parallel](http://neveradulldayinpoland.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_4970-1024x682.jpg) to the counter. Anyone not familiar with the other system will inevitably jump the queue, and even if you're aware of the difference it takes some time to get used to it. Think of it: in England, standing next to the person being served means you're out of the queue, while in Poland, standing behind the person being served means you're out of the queue. Maybe the queue jumpers are people not used to the UK system?

Also, the queuing to enter the bus (that is, forming the queue when the bus is still 10 minutes away, rather than forming the queue at the moment the bus arrives) is just ridiculous :).",null,0,null,1420395909,null,0,1420404502,0,cne9k3w,null,t3_2rbb7g,null,t1_cne9k3w,null,t3_2rbb7g,null,null,null,1425062875,null,6,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,6,null

However after the match today and thinking about the Arsenal match, I thought Iâd look into how Pelle compares with others, in particular on shot accuracy. As fantastic as he has been this season, there have been times when weâve expected to see the ball in the back of the net, only for that not to happen.

Iâve compared him with some of the PL top guns, former Saints players along with Messi and Ronaldo for a laugh. The stats were sourced from http://www.espnfc.co.uk/ and include internationals and cup competitions.

I think Pelle really needs to work on getting his shots on target, the stats show that when he does, he has a fair chance of scoring. I believe the stats also show that we definitely need to buy a goal scorer in January. If Mane hadnât hit a purple patch of form, I think we would have struggled to win our recent PL matches.

Tax on barter still doesn't make any practical sense. See, if I exchange item A for GBP and make a gain in GBP, there's a direct gain on which tax may need to be paid (in GBP), that's simple. But exchange item A for item B and there is no gain: the ""value"" of items A and B is wholly in the mind.

But your points are wholly valid and I think we both know what ""anti-money laundering"" rules are really about.

And let's not forget that plenty of states don't levy CGT at all. Examples include the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, Germany (for assets held longer than one year) and Singapore, to name but a few.

null,false,DevilishRogue,null,null,null,"&gt; Erm rent rises are not usually capped in the contract

There is literally nothing to stop you requesting such a clause if your contract lacks one and most landlords (certainly any respectable landlord) will include one as a matter of course. I've always used them both as a tenant and as a landlord - they bring a significant measure of security to both parties and rents don't change 33% over the course of an annual review. If you were paying below market rent at 33% for a year well done to you.

Evicting tenants is anything but easy if they aren't cooperative and if it gets to the point of eviction you can be assured that in most cases cooperation is the last thing on either parties mind. What the law says is not the same as what actually happens in practice, not to mention the costs, stress and effort involved.

With regard to rent controls they would be more likely to increase rental prices and increase black market operations as legitimate supply is reduced but demand remains steady than to bring rental prices down overall. The privileged few will benefit but many more will be worse off. Also, I cannot see it affecting house prices significantly as larger landlords will absorb the hit by reducing investment and maintenance on properties as the rent cap acts like the NMW does on salaries.

I've been a casual fan (i.e watching the TV shows as they came on, and maybe a few repeats, and perhaps an occasional novel here and there) since I was a kid in the early '70s. I was drifting off a little in series 6 and 7 of NuWho, but following the 50th, I've gone through ALL the fiction (novels, TV, audios, short stories, comics) for the [First](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/23pxb5/first_doctor_novels_short_stories_audio_and/) and [Second](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/2b77oi/second_doctor_novels_shortstories_audio_and/) Doctors, and am just about completing the Third. I've been using [this](http://www.eyespider.freeserve.co.uk/drwho/compleat.html) site as a guide and have managed to track down almost all of the tales mentioned. In fact I think that there are just a couple of First Doctor comics and the charity short-story collection *Perfect Timing* that I've not found so far.  

I've also read all the Eighth Doctor comics and heard all of his audios, and got most of the way through the BF spin-offs *Gallifrey*, *Jago &amp; Litefoot* and *I Davros*, as well as several other stand alone audios and the new Titan comics, and the three Twelfth Doctor novels and the eshort, and *Engines of War*. I've also gone through the TV *Sarah Jane Adventures*, and am half-way through a re-run of Torchwood (as well as a re-watch of all NuWho to date.). 

At this rate, however, it's going to take me another 3 years or so - at least - to complete the other media for the rest of Classic Who, and NuWho, and I really don't know if I'm going to keep going at the same rate, so it may be much longer.  

I know of a couple of Whovians (from whom I'm borrowing a lot of the material) who have been through most of it, but no-one who claims to have done EVERYTHING.  

Of course, the other issue is what exactly is ""Everything""? Where do you stop?

It is true that non-EU staff must pass the IELTS English competency exam, before getting a licence.

However, I don't think that the standard is very basic, and in my opinion is not really adequate for medical work, at least not for doctors. I have personally seen several doctors (with the qualification) make mistakes (or cause serious distress) based on misunderstanding of English. 

It should also be pointed out that EU staff are exempt from language testing, and under EU laws it is illegal to require or test EU staff language competency as part of the recruitment process (although, it is reasonably easy to spot at interview, at which point it isn't too difficult to fabricate a reason not to hire them).

These are some examples that I have personally come across: 
The word ""miscarriage"" is used in lay English as a term to describe the event where a pregnant woman loses the baby due to some sort of spontaneous problem with the pregnancy. Medical English uses the word ""abortion"" to describe the same situation. Similarly, the lay term ""abortion"" is, in medical terms, ""termination"". Asking a woman at the fertility clinic about her ""two abortions"" can lead to serious confusion. In this instance, it actually led to severe upset and a formal complaint to the hospital.

I've seen similar errors causing delay in treatment from misunderstanding of nuances of the language, or common misuses or language. For example, ""chronic"", used correctly, means ""long-term"". However, it is frequently mis-used by poorly educated people to mean ""serious"" or ""severe"". For example, ""My daughter has really chronic tummy pain"". If the child actually has short episodes of very severe pain, but the doctor thinks that the child has had continuous pain for several months, then there is potential for misdiagnosis, or delay in diagnosis.

Other examples include calling pain-killers, ""narcotics"" in letters copied to the patient. Technically correct, but easy to cause offence; confusion of ""trans-gender"" and ""transvestite"" - this one actually led to not only a formal complaint, but a police investigation, as there is a specific criminal offence of discrimination against a trans-gender individual.

I have no pity for her, as an estate agent it's her job to deal with tenants, we are not obligated to give her an easy time of it. She did successfully evict my next door neighbour but he had it coming smoking heroin at home and continually setting off the fire alarms. She dislike me because I smoked weed in my room but I always maintained in the absence of any complaints from the neighbours it was none of her business. I moved out of my own accord in the end and returned the flat to her clean and in impeccable condition, not out of respect for her but for the landlord of the home, they don't deserve to have their property damaged because of the actions of a terrible estate agent.

My point is similar to yours, the law is only 50% of the equation and the actions both of tenants and those managing the property factor well into the equation. But current rules can be used to make tenants feel insecure and are certainly effective if a landlord/agent knows what they are doing. I also think in the current climate of rising house prices any landlord would be a fool to put in a cap on rent increases and it never would have occured to me to ask.

As for now, I live in a lovely room in a shared house and the owners live downstairs but give us a lot of space and privacy. I think the rent is reasonable, I guess I'll have to wait and see if any price rise comes at the end of my year here.",null,0,null,1420398968,null,0,false,0,cnebagf,null,t3_2r9yf7,null,t1_cnebagf,null,t1_cneauo4,null,null,null,1425062067,null,4,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,4,null

Schurrle was absolutely horrendous again, deservedly subbed off at half time. I genuinely think he has until May to save his Chelsea career. Oscar took a heavy blow from the goalkeeper and never really seemed to recover from it as well. From a Chelsea point of view the first half was full of slowly moving the ball around the midfield and really showing how much we miss Fabregas' vision and Hazard's ability to commit defenders.

On a more positive note the half time changes made a huge difference, Willian really demonstrated the current gulf between him and Schurrle, and Costa was a more willing runner in behind the defence than Drogba had been.

Other than the win the main positive I'd take out of today was Zouma having another strong showing, really hope to see him start pushing for Premier League starts.

The abuse victim apologised and said the police showed him a picture of his abuser and wrongly told him it was McAlpine. His breakthrough of speaking publicly about his abuse was ruined by the whole fiasco and nobody dared touch the subject again.

Obviously a line must be drawn somewhere and people who are wrongly accused must have the right to defend themselves, and I'm not suggesting that I think McAlpine was lying and covering stuff up.

I'm sure it wont go well here, but Gerrard's career would look better with a league winner's medal. It is probably the one he would cherish above all and he failed to get one in his career. He was close but it ended in tears unfortunately. He did however succeed in getting a whole raft of other incredible medals and achievements and was probably one of the greatest players of his era. 

The comments on Nicky Butt isn't fair in my opinion. He won the medals he did by being the player he was. If he couldn't cut it around that United squad he wouldn't have been there, admittedly he wasn't at the level of Keane and Scholes but he performed when required to do so in a variety of roles on the fringes. Without players like him and SolskjÃ¦r United would have had less success. He deserves the league medals that Gerrard would kill for, that is football unfortunately.

More public housing is needed urgently.Post war governments managed to see a total of around 300,000 houses built every year for decades so it can be done we know this, the only barrier is ideological.
Neo cons, basically Tories and New labour were opposed to public housing as they are committed to the idea that the private sector can meet the supply as demand rises.
In reality we now know that without the public sector to drive competition the big builders have a monopoly on house building. They can get away with building less to keep demand high, prices high and offering lowering quality housing than was offered decades ago. 
The UK has some of the smallest new build housing in the western world, older social housing built to parker morris standards had much more space, part of what makes them so desirable today.

Arguably the most famous Tory policy was the Right to Buy, offering a huge discount to social housing tenants to buy their homes, as the Tories like to help everyone aspire to own their own home. 

Unfortunately they decided local government could not replace these houses so denying people the same aspiration in the future, so we can see that the Right to Buy was basically a vote buying scheme.

Given how many people have, in the recent past and currently, come forward with allegations after someone has been named in relation to an initial (set of) allegation(s), I'm not sure that it's a sensible course of action to protect the names of those accused of sexual assault etc. before they've been convicted.

In regard to the potential for false allegation: those are such a small fraction of the total number of assault/rape etc. accusations that it makes little sense to my mind to protect an individual in that way.

&gt; what effect would it have on a woman's family? They have not committed any crimes - why should they be punished?

This argument could also be applied to male prisoners, as it is seen that creating single parent families only serves to create broken households with financial stress and the increased odds of behavioural issues, with the sheer difference in the amount of men to females in prison surely punishing a larger amount of families through them would be the greater issue?

&gt;or equally men should be included in this exemption
&gt;&gt;That wouldn't necessarily be for the best.

And again I don't see how your argument cannot be applied to men in the same circumstance, [this article pretty much answers all of your 'maybe' queries](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-10725163), community sentences cost well under half of the cost for sending someone to prison, so in fact it would be increasingly viable and better on budget if you're looking at that angle, to apply the same exemption to men, as there would be greater savings due to the larger number of male prisoners. 

&gt;It might help the state, the offenders or society in general

This would still result in the continuation of lenient sentencing and then abolition of non-violent sentencing on the basis of gender, I doubt creating more social double standards would help society.

Coming as a caster, I would focus less on the paying casters angle. Considering that the people you're going to be attracting (Such as myself) will be on the amateur level. This means that financial incentives are the least important thing you can offer (At least at the financial level's you're going to be offering).

If you truly want to help the casters and make it worthwhile, you need to guarantee viewership. That's the big draw so to say. And by that I mean you need to advertise (Betting sites, social media, here on the reddit, joindota etc etc), and is the biggest mistake most new admins make (Seriously, you'll have events that drop a 10K prize pool, then forget to tell anyone about anything). Keeping an amateur caster at 50-150 viewers per match is far more useful and worthwhile long run than being paid some small amount.

As a second note, you should REALLY look into getting a sponsor, even if it'll help with the raffle prizes. There are a bunch of companies that focus on the UK scenes (Such as the upcoming BoredGamer.co.uk stuff, or GAMIDAS). Considering you're already supplying the prize pool, I can't see these smaller companies not being interested in throwing out some product + additional cash for advertising, unless you call your event ""Hitler was right gaming"".

For an object lesson go and look at Venezuela.

In short:

 - If the control is lower than the price the market is willing to pay, then there will be an instant lack of supply.  i.e. no houses available to rent.

 - If the control is higher than the price the market is willing to pay, then there will be an instant lack of demand.  i.e. no tennants willing to rent.

One assumes in the case of a control supported by the public, the former of these would be what they think they want.  That matches up with, for example, Venezeula's government ""helping"" the people by keeping toilet paper nice and cheap...

null,false,DevilishRogue,null,null,null,"&gt; current rules can be used to make tenants feel insecure and are certainly effective if a landlord/agent knows what they are doing.

There is no benefit to the landlord in having an unhappy tenant though. Landlords want stability as much as tenants do and the best way to achieve that and reduce the risk of void periods where rent isn't being paid is to have happy tenants who want to stay for the longer term. In almost every conceivable instance the benefits of foisting up the rent to the point the tenant wants to leave will result in a significant empty period for the landlord that will outweigh the benefit of the rent increase.

&gt; in the current climate of rising house prices any landlord would be a fool to put in a cap on rent increases

A cap on rent increases is a boon for both parties as it leads to realistic expectations. 3-8% is ideal as this will be enough to cover inflation plus any potential market rise in a given area over a year, assuming the market rent is set at a fair price in the first instance. And if the market doesn't rise sufficiently to cover inflation or indeed falls, the parties can renegotiate if they so wish. I've used this system successfully for over a decade now.

&gt; I guess I'll have to wait and see if any price rise comes at the end of my year here.

If you keep abreast of what the market does in your area you'll be in a good position to negotiate should you feel it necessary, although if you are happy with your landlord and they are happy with you it may not even be necessary as landlords want good tenants even more than tenants want good landlords.",null,0,null,1420403315,null,0,false,0,cnedr47,null,t3_2r9yf7,null,t1_cnedr47,null,t1_cnebagf,null,null,null,1425060847,null,0,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,0,null

I'd imagine there is more than a tinge of regret. The game is about winning. Regardless of how we want to imagine Gerrard is held as a legend in the game, most objective pundits/punters will immediately question the fact that he has never won the league. Most of the time great players move to teams that contain equally great players and win things. Gerrard didn't do that for whatever reason which is nice, but by not doing so he didn't win a league medal that he had the potential to do many times over. I'm afraid that will stick in his legacy just as Istanbul, the FA Cup final performance and so on.

No. 

If we built prisons for non-violent women, we'd have to move people out of the prisons they're currently in, leaving those prisons half-empty and running up an unnecessary cost. 

&gt; This argument could also be applied to male prisoners, as it is seen that creating single parent families only serves to create broken households with financial stress and the increased odds of behavioural issues, with the sheer difference in the amount of men to females in prison surely punishing a larger amount of families through them would be the greater issue?

That's not my point. I meant that if women were split into violent/non-violent prisons, they'd necessarily be further away from their familiies, since there are fewer prisons for women.

* The Christmas tree have to be done the [8th of December](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_of_the_Immaculate_Conception).
* The same day we make our nativity scene. Depending on the region it is really accurate or very absurd (The naples one is full of political/soccer characters too)
* Usually school closes the 23th and the christmas play roll. Every school's class prepare something for their parents. Usually just until the 10y old.
* The 24th evening we have our Christmast Dinner. It's just like the lunch of the 25th but only for the close relatives (parent with sons that still lives with them). Just for the ones who lives in the same house to be clear.
* The night of the 24th someone disguise himself as Santa Claus and deliver the gift to the child of the surroundings, of course agree with the parents.
* The same night it's possibile to take part with the midnight holy mass. Usually it's not something for children but... never understimate the needs of ""make a good presentation"" typical of the average italian family.
* The 25th is the big day of course. There is a mass again for whoever missed the midnight mess and the children open the presents. Starting very early the grandmothers/mothers begin to cook for the lunch that will happens around 14 - 15 o'clock and will go on until 18 o'clock usually with several pause to rest.
* Most of the tradition of the 25th involves food. It changes A LOT from city to city. For example in rome we cook something typical of rome, from the Abbacchio to Carciofi alla Giudea while in Naples the meal is mostly fish based.
* Typical treaties for Christmas are the Panettone and Pandoro. The very symbol of christmas here. They're garnished with several different cream, depending on the region of Italy (cream, lemon custard, chocolate, icecream, ...)
* There are many more anyway, from Panforte to Ricciarelli and to Cantucci with Vin Santo.
* The 26th is the day dedicated to relatives that didn't make it for the lunch of the 25th. Nothing really hard, usually just passing by a couple hours after lunch (or during lunch) to say hi and exchange presents.
* From 26th to 30th usually people goes to work mostly to digest what they've eat. The productivity of the entire country is at the lowest of the year.

There is much more but really depends of the region / city.
Contrary to the UK we didn't have many social traditions (the city light are switched without any ceremony). It's a very private festivity and you rarely see public manifestation of ""merry"".

Anecdote time: My father and I were once discussing adoption by gay parents. His thoughts were that it probably wasn't the right thing to do because the adopted children might be teased and bullied by other kids at school. I'm sure you'll agree that while that notion is coming from, to an extent, the right place it's obviously not a concern that should dictate adoption practices: there are always going to be homophobes, but one way of reducing their number is education of kids to accept them. My response to his concern can be summed up as: ""We shouldn't cater to the fuckwits."" and that is how I think these accusations should be dealt with too.

Similarly in these instances there are always going to be people who lose their shit at the 'p' word (or words that are similar to it).

In almost all major sports from the very young age groups all the way through senior only recreational leagues, in order to win a championship(league title) you have to go through some sort of playoff tournament and win it. It's just how we do things.  
  
No matter how well a team performs in the ""regular season,""  it's almost an American tradition to prove that your team is really that good when it really matters, when the stakes are the highest, when if you lose, you go home, the ""Playoffs."" The proof that one team is the best from regular season play, for some reason has never been enough for American Audiences. The backdrop of elimination must be present in order for the drama to be the highest. European football audiences see this of course every year in Champions League, their respective league cups, The European Championships every four years,  and The World Cup every four years as well, in the knockout stages.

Unfortunately for me and my partner it's also a predominantly student area.  Because there is such a massive turnover of tenants every year, and with two universities in the city there is always a constant stream of new students, the landlords have an attitude of ""it'll do for students, if you don't like it fuck off"".  We have lived in five of six different properties in the area, over a period of about as many years, and every landlord has been the same.

As the Ice age ended plants animals and humans moved North from Iberia and the area now submerged by the celtic sea. Meso toll kits do not match Briton France or even Iberia because the evidence for the development of their tool kits is now submerged. By 7000BC meso people abandon microlith technology while all of Europe continue the tradition. Ireland is defiantly an island at this point. 

We have early evidence for a failed attempt at farming at Ferritors Cove in Co. Cork so it seems Hunter gather fishers imported farm animals and crops and adopted farming slowly over centuries. Of coarse people came and went but to the basic genetics of the people what difference does that make to the population. 

Over Time you have beaker traditions and many more including Celtic art but no evidence anywhere for invasion. NW Europe has it's own wide spread tradition and trade during pre history but Ireland has always had a distinctive or home made twist on greater European traditions.

No, of course he isn't. Because if striker A had 6 more chances but ended up losing the ball without even shooting, and striker B has shot well, forced saves, got corners for his team, etc - than striker B helped his team more. It's all about context.

That's not to justify any sexual abuse occurring in the scouts, nor detract from it in any way. However it does give some context to the numbers being thrown around. 

From the article itself: 

&gt; To put the figures in context, the Scout Association has said that only 48 previous abuse claims have been made against them since its formation in 1907.

I doubt the numbers are correct. It's probably over 200 cases. That's not good - but it's not the 23,000 UK wide in the last year. The Scouts are not a secretive den of child abuse. 

I attended the Scouts when I was younger and had the best of times, made friends, learned new skills and enjoyed myself immensely. 

I think it would be a great shame to see inappropriately knee-jerk pressure brought to bear. *However* consistent monitoring of the safety of children attending anything - be it school, Scouts, youth club movements or local football teams - is not an awful idea provided it's done in a non-invasive manner.

As an example housing benefit pumps Â£16 billion a year into the housing sector, this raises prices for those who can't get housing benefit (which is large proportion of low income workers). To cover these people you'd probably have to double this bill and then you'd raise prices for the low-mid income people, only serving to shift the problem along.

Secondly, the implementation of QE caused an inflation of asset prices, primarily housing.

The Bank of England is keeping the base rate at an artificially low level which results in low mortgage interest rates which favours people buying property to let as well as encouraging investment into housing.

The government refuses to provision more social housing and is not making available plots of land for more housing development.

The reasons for doing this is that a large number of MPs are buy to let landlords and/or have mortgages on two homes. Many are invested in the London property bubble. They also believe that housing market is the only thing keeping the economy growing and fear a collapse would shrink GDP growth back into recession, this is believed to be a ""bad thing"".

There's also a much larger population than the official figures state, causing a drain on housing:

For one they need to stop putting housing developments up for approval/rejection by the people living next to the proposed building sites.

People currently living on a ""nice"" estate that leads nowhere will *always* oppose more houses being built next to it, with the access being through the existing one. And as for building council houses, you can fucking forget about it.

Property developers own, and have done for about decade now, the fields next to the estate I'm living on. No fanfare, the farmer that previously owned the land just stopped planting crops one year. Now the only thing done with it is hay-making, to remove the temptation to set fires in there (which, tbh, doesn't stop the little oiks that light them).

The fields a little further along, on the other side of the railway tracks, have been/are being built on. A small group of houses was added right next to the fields, on the main road, with their access road clearly intended for extension into a larger estate.

There has been no consult that I know of, yet, about the possibility of building on those fields. I know that when they do hold one, however, at least half the people on my street are going to oppose any plans to build more houses there. For no reason other than they like the view over the fields, or they use them for dog-walking.

Personally, I think that any new developments need to include at least a primary school, more than one access road, and some shops would be nice too.

I often see arguments such as asking the public:-

&gt;*""Is Immigration good or bad?""

I find such questions to demonstrate, to be fallacious:-

* Immigration is not a single object
* Immigration is not a static number but includes multiple rates
* Immigration measurement of effect is both qualitative and quantitative
* Immigration policy depends on a range: National, EU, International Treaties

This is all for example. To come back to the EU:-

* European =/= EU
* EU =/= Single Market
* EU =/= EZ

Looking at the most prosperous Nations in the recent index:-

1. Switzerland
2. Norway

Both have access to Single Market (EEA and EFTA) but are not in the Political Union (EU). Looking at the EZ countries you have Economies in big trouble eg Greece.

Leaving the EU with access to the Single Market more or less does not change anything intrinsically from the day of the referendum to the day hypothetically leaving.

The only ""uncertainty"" involves leaving sans Article 50 TEU Lisbon Treaty and that via access to Single Market.

The Political Union of the EU is redundant and possibly deleterious:-

[Annual UK/EU trade deficit soars to Â£56 billion](http://www.betteroffout.net/annual-ukeu-trade-deficit-soars-to-56-billion/)

Membership fees of the EU vs EEA as per Norway:-

[Quoting Dr. North](http://www.eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=85315) (EU historian and expert on this subject):-

&gt;*Reviewing the actual EFTA budget, the sum attributed to ""EEA related activities"" is â¬8,145,000. That is the membership contribution, out of the â¬22,369,000 total EFTA budget, of which Norway pays just over half (55.35 percent).* **In effect. Noway pays about â¬5 million a year for single market access.**

Compared to the UK's EU membership fee of &gt;60 million per year (updated gross):-[Is our EU membership fee Â£55 million?](https://fullfact.org/economy/cost_eu_membership_gross_net_contribution-30887)

&gt;*Itâs reasonable to describe Â£55 million as our âmembership feeâ, but it ignores the fact that we get money back as well. In other words, Â£55 million a day represents the UKâs âgross contributionsâ to EU institutions. Our net contributions are the equivalent of Â£33 million per day on these terms.*

However, this is merely the economic argument. The democratic deficit of the EU is very great and hence the argument is:

&gt;*Is it democratic to be a part of the EU for the UK?*

All the evidence that I have come across points to a decisive ""No."" But rarely does this question become raised because of the confusion created by ""Economic Uncertainty"" arguments which go round and round and round.

If Gomis can find form while Bony is away, it'd make sense to incorporate both strikers.  The 3-5-2 idea is definitely something to ponder, especially if we don't sign another wing back and either Taylor or Rangel pick up an injury in the second half of the season.  I also have some  ideas, some worse than others.

I think I mentioned this before the season started, but what we could try is dropping Sigurdsson into the deeper role that he has played with Iceland in the qualifiers, allowing the team to play a 4-2-2-2 as Man City do (and like you mentioned with the 4-4-2), with Gylfi pairing with Ki in the center midfield, and allowing Bony and Gomis to work together up top.  http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=5ky8n

However, I'd prefer keeping our current formation by dropping Gylfi to the deep lying spot, and playing Bony in the 10 as he did occasionally with Vitesse.  That would look a little like this http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=5ky8m 

Or we could go with a back three, but I'm not comfortable losing our wingers, who have been great this year, so we could go with a 3-2-3-2 with our usual front seven, and three centerbacks.  I would never use this, as our defense has already been a little weak this season, but it is interesting to think about.  http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=5ky8p 

I definitely agree that if Gomis plays well while Bony is away that Garry should experiment with the two of them together.  It will be interesting to see how he would do that, or even if he would do that, but it's something to think about.

Fortunately if you are prepared (and able) to pay more than students I suspect you'd be able to find a landlord that would be happy to offer higher quality in return for the rental premium and not having to deal with bloody students!,null,0,null,1420410109,null,0,false,0,cneho8o,null,t3_2r9yf7,null,t1_cneho8o,null,t1_cneg3y8,null,null,null,1425059018,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

This is just a loose theory but I was wondering in the jail cell at the Tower of London when the three Doctors were talking about the difference between the supposedly more mature War Doctor and the child-like qualities of Ten and Eleven, the Moment specifically refers to them as ""the man who regrets and the man who forgets"".  The Fires of Pompeii was an episode where Donna really chided the Doctor about doing the right thing and trying to save, even when he knows it's a fixed point in time.  He basically broke a rule and allowed himself to grow up and become a ""household god"" when he saved Lucius Caecilius Iucundus' family.

I think that conversation in the Tower of London really caused the Doctor to realize he was running away from being an adult and accepting his age so he gave himself that face to remind him of the responsibility of being a Time Lord and protecting people, even if it means saving only a few rather than everyone.  it completes a story arc begun in The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances when the Doctor, fresh off the Time War (and the final moments of The Day of the Doctor) realized he could save everyone.

Certainly not the Tories. What about Labour? The same Labour party that both introduced tuition fees, then tripled them? The same Labour party that'll be remembered primarily for its idiotic hand in turning a sizeable fraction of the Middle-East into a smoking crater? The same Labour party that repeatedly gave its civil libertarian-minded members the finger across the past decade and a half at every opportunity it could find? 

They've done more than enough reprehensible things in their time. If one [not necessarily negative](http://www.libdems.org.uk/get_the_facts_student_finance), relatively unimportant policy is enough to render the Lib Dems unelectable/borderline-satanic Toryettes for all eternity, the only non-Tory alternative certainly doesn't get away unscathed. 

Consider what the Lib Dems [have](http://whatthehellhavethelibdemsdone.com/) done. Securing a referendum to change the electoral system to something less insane (alas), the [Protection of Freedoms Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_of_Freedoms_Act) and same-sex marriage are three Lib Dem triumphs that I'm enormously glad we've got out of coalition. 

Crying ""tuition fees!"" every time Clegg's name comes up doesn't devalue the stuff that they've managed to do. Given that they hold less than a sixth of the seats in this government, that they've managed to get *so much* of their manifesto into power is a respectable outcome- it's flat-out impossible to get *everything* you want in Coalition. The Tories have been blocked just about as much as the Lib Dems have- things like the [Snooper's Charter](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nick-clegg/10019365/Nick-Clegg-blocks-Tory-plans-for-a-snoopers-charter.html) is dead and buried thanks to Liberal intervention. 

""Selling out""? Is it hell. The whole point of coalition's compromise for the sake of forming a government and getting as much of your own set of policies and ideas implemented as you can. The most significant difference here's that the Lib Dems have been unfortunate enough to be in a position where they're a distinct part of a government, rather than the whole thing- meaning reneging on a manifesto point isn't a ""necessary evil"" (as under Labour), so much as a ""betrayal"", thanks to the Labour propaganda machine.",null,0,null,1420410475,null,0,1420410806,0,cnehv1y,null,t3_2rbfhx,null,t1_cnehv1y,null,t1_cneh97u,null,null,null,1425058931,null,9,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,9,null

I admit to not being an expert in the area. I'm simply pointing out that I've heard similar arguments before over a long period of time. If there's finally some meat to them then I'd welcome it. But I am yet to be convinced.

If you are knowledgeable in the area, then please provide sources to justify your point.  I'll quote the wikipaedia article that was linked by another user, which is so far the only information provided by the pro-fusion people:

&gt; In September 2013 the NIF was widely acclaimed to have achieved a milestone in controlled fusion, by successfully initiating a reaction that resulted in the release of more energy than the fuel absorbed â even if only for a fraction of a second.[100] However, it was still far short of creating a self-sustaining reaction.[101] The process will need to be made more efficient to yield commercially viable amounts of energy.[102]

A reaction for a fraction of a second is still a long, long way from a commercially viable power plant.  Another quote from the same article:

&gt; A scenario has been presented of the effect of the commercialization of fusion power on the future of human civilization.[151] ITER and later Demo are envisioned to bring online the first commercial nuclear fusion energy reactor by 2050. Using this as the starting point and the history of the uptake of nuclear fission reactors as a guide, the scenario depicts a rapid take up of nuclear fusion energy starting after the middle of this century.

So ""by 2050..."" fits the 30 year time table I described perfectly. 

If you have better sources, link them.  I have no aversion to learning.

Edit: May I also point you at this article: http://www.newstatesman.com/sci-tech/2014/11/forever-20-years-away-will-we-ever-have-working-nuclear-fusion-reactor. It points out that even if everything being promised about fusion comes true this time (and doesn't fail like so many past promises), it still won't be soon enough. If we want to confront global warming, we need to do it right now, not wait for future technology that may or may not arrive.

I suppose that one could make the argument that Luis was able to recover his position faster than Brana, but I think the real difference was the quality of opposition. Very rarely was any of their players able to get past Cahill so it was quite easy for him to push them out wide nulifying any counter attack.

The fact is that BTL is a symptom of the problem, not a cause.  BTL increases the housing stock by converting larger properties into multiple smaller ones capable of housing more people.  Attacking BTL is counter productive, but it doesn't fit in with their narrative, even though it's objectively true that they aren't the problem, the lack of housing is.

As it is only last summer did the UK receive powers to assess the language skills of doctors coming from the EU.  Before this they had been unable to officially discriminate on language grounds, so no language competency checks.  So things are getting better but it means we have a legacy to deal with.  [This very much was the case, and the General Medical Council talked about it.](http://www.gmc-uk.org/publications/23811.asp)

Fortunately the lion share of the NHS recruitment comes from outside the EU (excluding native speakers like Ireland) where their universities tend to teach in English, such as India or Pakistan.

The problem there is its all very well having English competency when being interviewed by university articulates, or when being taught in your own accent, but the skill doesn't necessarily carry when you bring it to Newcastle or deepest Gloucstershire.

We don't just need basic language competency tests, we need rigorous competency tests and for them to be applied to all. This is an ongoing problem where people have died as a result, so 'No' this isn't showboating.  It's following up on an ongoing issue the mechanism to deal with which is less than a year old - *IF it goes far enough and is implemented properly*.  

The GMC have been pushing for more rigorous testing for quite some time. In 2010 the head of the British Medical Association, Dr Hamish Meldrum, warned that what testing they had wasn't being adequately enforced.

There was plenty of food being produced in Ireland, the 'Famine' refers to a blight that specifically attacked the potato crops that poor people in Ireland were expected to survive on while working the land of their English landlords. A fungus called 'Phytophthora infestans'. The disease blackened the potato leaves and turned the potatoes in the ground into a mushy mess.

The view in Westminster of the Irish was simply that they were not worth the effort and that anything that happened there was their fault. There were those who argued that if the Irish could not survive the way they lived, then they should fall by the wayside - 'Survival of the fittest'.

During the time of 'The Hunger', Â£1million of corn and barley were exported from Ireland to mainland Britain, along with quantities of dairy produce. Any initiatives to help, were hindered or simply blocked by the chief civil servant to the Treasury â Charles Edward Trevelyan, all altogether saintly human being: 

âProtestant and Catholic will freely fall and the land will be for the survivors.â

âThe real evil with which we have to contend is not the physical evil of the Famine but the moral evil of the selfish, perverse and turbulent character of the people.â

Every possible effort by local organizations to feed the starving were thwarted and frustrated by a British government intent on teaching the Irish a lesson and forcing market forces on them. The govenrment deliberately managed a natural event to rid Ireland of excess population. 

Genocide - ""the systematic destruction of all or a significant part of a racial, ethnic, religious or national group"".

Between 1846 and 1850, due to starvation and emigration, the population of Ireland dropped by 2 million which represented 25% of the total population. 

But sure lets all sit back and have a big healthy gut-laugh at those silly Irish and their silly ways. Becasue i'm an ignorant cunt and sure what do I know?

A lot of those 2-0 victories should have been much bigger considering our gulf in class. I'm not talking about the Spurs game, that was just a terrible defensive game. Reus wouldn't help us score 6 goals but if we had Reus, Cuadrado or Schurrle in form, Ivanovic wouldn't need to help out as much and maybe we'd do better.

The groundwork is being laid by HMG to significantly reduce the quality of terms &amp; conditions in doctors' contracts in England &amp; Wales.  Step one is to make all junior doctors be on the same contract.  That way, it's easy to TUPE them around under their planned system of multiple private employers.  It will also mean that groups of doctors will no longer be able to cite regional differences in T&amp;Cs as grounds for unfair treatment (which happens reasonably often at the moment).  

Part of the same negotiations include a planned 30% pay cut for GP trainees at a time when no junior doctors want to train in the specialty.  This is either in there as a divide and rule thing or will be taken out so the rest of it gets through successfully.

Basically, originally, Doctor Who wasn't going to be a mere TV movie in the works for *six years*. After the BBC had canned Doctor Who because Michael Grade was ~~literally Hitler~~ not fond of it, the team went abroad to try to get an international version made with the then BBC Enterprises. It passed through many iterations, even *Steven Spielberg* had his hands on it, allegedly, at one point. 

The plan for the series originally (with Amberlin Productions) was going to be the Doctor looking for his father, Ulysses, as a rebooted series. Allegedly, Spielberg thought it was too much like *The Last Crusade* and canned it. The folks then turned to Fox who were between two choices of TV shows: A British show with a lot of baggage about an alien man who travels around time in a police box (what's a police box anyway?) and a  show about a college supergenius tween, his girlfriend, [his sarcastic quantum mechanics professor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4nfHAM7qiA), and an out of work soul-singer are trapped continually running from alternate Earth to alternate Earth. For the records, the latter was picked up as a series and became Sliders, with two excellent series, one mediocre, and one so bad we refuse to talk of it without making the sign of the cross, and then the sign of the very cross indeed.

Now, Fox was smart (well, not really, they forced a unique episode's villain of Sliders to become an alien-esque overarcing villain, let alone what they did to Firefly) so they said to the people working on the Who scripts ""Hey, how about we make a short TV movie and if it's popular, we'll greenlight a series through the backdoor"". This is how things like Battlestar Galactica (2004) got done so it's not a bad design in general. But the team decided to rush and not explain parts; why was the Master on trial? The original plan for the series was going to end with the Master trying to take over Gallifrey with his own homebrewed Daleks; the Skaro Daleks put him on trial for ""subverting Dalek Supremecy"" and the Time Lords wanted him not to be a threat but couldn't kill him themselves. Along with the Half Human part, a lot of the stranger unanswered questions from the TVM were dropped plots they were expecting to answer in the series; if it didn't get greenlit it wasn't like it was going to matter, not like the Beeb was going to make episodes that would need continuity anymore right?...

It *was* a horrible production, no doubt about that, but it's one of those stories of production hell that ends up with a product that has references to plotlines removed years ago, tone shifts, and bad choices in general (why wasn't the TARDIS revealed when Lee went in for the first time, not the first shot, dammit).",null,0,null,1420413321,null,0,false,0,cnejcuy,null,t3_2rbndn,null,t1_cnejcuy,null,t3_2rbndn,null,null,null,1425058233,null,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

[First Doctor] Technically you see a hand under a cloak in their first appearance in *The Daleks* but that's not much and contradicts their later appearances. As for why Ian (not the Doctor) can control the Dalek, originally the Daleks *weren't* going to be ""bug eyed monsters"" but people like you or I who had to hide inside machines to escape radiation and became xenophobic. This was the early years of Who, before it became monster-of-the-week (infact they were the only monsters for a while, the rest of the episodes being historical like Marco Polo or the French Revolution) so count it as Early Installment Weirdness.

[Second Doctor] You see *gloop* in *Power of the Daleks* being put in shells but nothing concrete.
 
[Fourth for Genesis, Fifth for Resurrection]*Genesis---*, and *Resurrection of the Daleks* both had some appearance of the mutant from the Daleks as small globules [that could attack people from outside of the shell](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e6/Dalek_attack.jpg)

[Sixth Doctor] Revelations of the Daleks had a human inside a glass case being mutated into a Dalek, and [Seventh Doctor] Remembrance of the Daleks had a lobster-esque claw of a Dalek explicitley said to be quite different from the ""regular"" kinda appear onscreen, but honestly these were both ""new"" Daleks that were different inside the case so it doesn't really count.

[Ninth Doctor] But honestly the first time we see them prominantly was in Ecclestone's *Dalek*, that was part of the major reveal at the end. Heck, part of what made the Dalek Emperor such an imposing villain for fans in 2005 was that he was the first fullgrown Dalek to be *visible* within his shell.

Plenty of accommodation all around Montgomeryshire from cottages to chalets. 

You can access everything from rivers, lakes &amp; forests to quiet beaches within 90 mins of where you stay. 

Just a few spots I'd recommend;

Lake Vyrnwy - Victorian reservoir with stunning forest walks and amazing views. 

Montgomery Castle - hidden gem overlooking the surrounding countryside. 

Castell y Bere - beautiful Castle ruins from the time of Welsh Kings.

Cader Idris - second highest peak in Wales. 
 
Talyllyn Lake - the scenery in this glacial Valley is stunning. 

Barmouth - walk across the Mawddach estuary on the railway bridge. 

Aberdyfi - lovely village on the Dyfi estuary with pubs, harbourside walks, golden beaches &amp; dunes. 

Machynlleth - home to Centre for Alternative technology along with many antique and secondhand bookshops. 

Aberystwyth - fading splendour of the Victorian promenade &amp; pier,  surviving as a university town.

Clywedog Lake - big dam, sailing, fishing, stunning views across the surrounding hills. 

Some areas can be busy but it's so easy to find quiet out of the way spots because there's very little in the way of large local towns.

If the lake district was on your list then you'd LOVE Mid Wales.

Secondly, they can also be an accident as well as collateral damage.

They're still collateral damage, but if we didn't mean to kill them, then it was an accident. Doesn't mean that we didn't kill them, just that they weren't meant to be in the crossfire.

If a soldier in a street was firing down the street at some taliban fighters sticking out of some windows, and a kid runs out of an alley in front of the soldier and gets hit, or a bullet passes though a wall and hits a kid the soldier didn't know was there, then those were accidents.

There is no question as to why Willian is playing as confidently and as well as he has been - he hasnt really had to compete for that spot on the wing and has been fortunate enough to enjoy plenty of minutes. SchÃ¼rrle hasn't played the minutes Willian has, and he's under a lot of pressure to earn that spot again. Getting leftover minutes and minimal playing time aside from starting today, it's ridiculous to expect him to knock Willian out of a starting position.


I'm not saying he hasn't been struggling, but these knee jerk reactions about trading him are ridiculous. He's a phenomenal player, he just needs to be trusted with more minutes and more opportunities. He'll turn it around this half of the season, and if not, then next season.

* Centre backs: Rodgers has worked with a good half dozen top defenders in his time at Liverpool, and the defence has never been good. Throwing money at more players in this position isn't going to solve these problems: coaching, and more effective protection from midfield is what we need.
* Defensive midfield: we need to improve in this area, and an accomplished player to rotate with (or be better than) Lucas would be good signing.
* Attacking midfield: we have a lot of young talent, but if we could land a big name who could have an immediate impact on the pitch as well as the training ground, that would be awesome. It would be somebody with goals in him. But it's not really a priority.
* Strikers: we need 2 or 3, ideally proven goalscorers, of the type who play off the shoulder and make runs in behind defenders. Pace, mobility and work-rate off the ball are hugely important, but getting shots on target is the most important attribute.

Any player who can improve the squad would most certainly be welcome, but the positions where we need new signings are the fella who stops the ball going in our net, and a few fellas who are good at putting the ball in the other team's net.

 [**Individual retirement account**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual%20retirement%20account): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;An __Individual Retirement Account__  or IRA, is a form of [""individual retirement plan""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement_plan),  provided by many financial institutions, that provides [tax advantages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_advantage) for [retirement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement) savings in the United States. An individual retirement account is a type of ""individual retirement arrangement""  as described in IRS Publication 590, __Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)__.  The term *IRA*, used to describe both individual retirement accounts and the broader category of individual retirement arrangements, encompasses an individual retirement account; a trust or custodial account set up for the exclusive benefit of taxpayers or their beneficiaries; and an individual retirement [annuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annuity_(US_financial_products\)),  by which the taxpayers purchase an annuity contract or an endowment contract from a life insurance company.

The 2005 series is designed to slowly reintroduce the show to a modern audience so most people start there. However, it is possible to jump to season 5 if you are not able to get into the first new season. The first episode of the new show is rough, so don't judge the entire thing based on that. 

The  main character has a trick of changing his face which allows for different actors to play different versions usually refered to by number. The 2005 series starts with the 9th Doctor. If you want to get a sense of each version in the new series to see what appeals to you, I would recommend these episodes;

But when they made this particular hero, they didn't give him a gun--they gave him a screwdriver to fix things. 
They didn't give him a tank or a warship or an x-wing fighter--they gave him a box from which you can call for help. 
And they didn't give him a superpower or pointy ears or a heat-ray--they gave him an extra heart.

He was obviously joking and it may seem like we were forced against our will to support Chelsea, but during those years when we weren't anything to sneeze at in the league I just remember those FA and League cup finals feeling just as important and exciting as the Champions League final felt 2 years ago, so it was always great to be a Chelsea fan.

We moved to America when I was 7 and with my quasi American accent now I get a lot of people accusing me of being a bandwagoner or a fairweather fan. Whenever that happens and I'm at home I always just walk upstairs and grab my Gianfranco Zola shirt from when I was 5 during the '97 season and show to them as proof of my status as a Chelsea lifer.

The fact that rent controls don't work, is another matter.

You have people who can't afford to live in the city but do because their rent is kept artificially low. The alternative is to let people's rent increase (or decrease) according to the value of the space they inhabit.

If people saw their rents increasing, they would be more receptive to fixing the actual problem, which is to say, not enough units--and thus, the market would eventually adjust. At present, you have a lot of people who are more than happy paying pennies on their rent-controlled units and oppose all new housing developments because they would block their view.

Nice.

As to your second point, landlords could indeed be forced to operate at a loss. They are obliged to pay maintenance costs and property taxes, which are calculated as a a percentage of the TRUE market value of the property. If the value of the property increases by 5% per year, but they are only allowed to raise rent on their tenants by 1% per year, eventually they could be paying more in property taxes and maintenance costs than they are getting back from their tenants.

And I used a stencil I made using freezer paper. There's a whole subreddit devoted to this craft/hobby (r/bleachshirts) and that's how I learned.
Freezer paper is waxy on one side and papery on the other... You cut out the design you want with an xacto knife and iron the freezer paper to the shirt; the waxy side makes it adhere to the shirt. Then spray it with a 50/50 bleach water solution. The exposed part bleached &amp;amp; the covered part doesn't.

Here's a picture of it ironed onto the shirt. The other shirts you see are used to protect the parts the freezer paper didn't cover.

The simple truth is this happens, you cant be killing people pretending to be civilians and not eventually make a mistake, it would be naive to think otherwise. Our troops have killed *each other* accidentally.

This posts Title is very misleading. This ""Kill List"" did not ""Show"" the civilians because they were not on it. ""Children"" No, *one* child died. They did not die in ""Pursuit"" of the Commander they died because of a mistake. The Apache Pilot was not ordered to kill them nor did he try to kill them on purpose. The title even mentions ""Low-Level"" something both articles seem to mention which bears no significance. Level 3 out 4 is not low level, it was still high enough to warrant an Apache gunship and his death. The source article mentions ""number 3,673"" but doesn't explain in anyway how the list is organised. I seriously doubt they bother to individually grade them compared to 4000 others, far more likely its just the order they are added with additional information containing their ""level"".

The fact that this article was even created for the death of two civilians is also surprising. 50,000+ civilians have died in that Hell-hole in the past decade. Most don't even die in operations involving ""Commanders"".

That's how a company in a globalised economy works now, and it's how they've worked pretty much forever (certainly since Adam Smith).
