Let's note that *you're* the one who's including blacking up in a list with behavior that is objectively bigoted.  I'm not for one second defending people who make sexist, racist or homophobic comments.  My claim is simply that there's nothing objectively bigoted about putting on black face-paint.  

Yes, it may well be that many people who paint themselves black are actual racists, but that doesn't mean that the act itself is necessarily racist!  

Imagine a society where people assumed that wearing green T-shirts was racist.   Pretty soon, the only people who would wear such apparel would be actual racists or those who wanted to break taboos.  But, does that mean that wearing a green T-shirt is a racist act?  No it doesn't.  It's just an arbitrary taboo.

In this alternate universe people might protest that wearing green T-shirts has a history associated with racism and that I would be a fool to ignore that history.  Yes, OK, but that still doesn't mean that the act itself is racist.  A correlation is not the same as the thing itself.

Maybe this seems too philosophical, but I'm of the opinion that it's best to reserve criticism for when *actual* racism occurs, rather than build up the power of fairly arbitrary cultural taboos and constantly police people's speech for signs of possible transgressions.

That is goal oriented thinking. Disease is bad because it cause somebody to feel pain, why it does what it does is irrelevant. Evolution explain why disease exist, it has nothing to say about it being evil or not.

Take torture as an example. I don't see a reason to postulate God to say that it is evil, it feel bad for the person that is being tortured making it intrinsically bad.

""So how do you define evil in the absence of a god or any kind of meaning?""

Evil = suffering or lack of well being.

And I think that there is meaning, it just isn't somewhere out there after life, if you love somebody they have a meaning to you etc. Even something trivial like eating food that you enjoy has a meaning to you that exist even if there is no ultimate goal to your existence.

CBT is the first stage of training. It's really to prepare you for the road. You can't prepare for the preparation if that makes sense. Really you just need to have a decent understanding of the highway code ideally. Helps you prevent yourself from killing yourself. Not a bad idea to watch some CBT footage on youtube to give yourself a bit of a feel for it. 

Can I find online the material I need to study for the theory test? Should I just study the Highway code or should I check other material as well? 

e-bay. Honestly its full of revision material and so on with interactive DVDs which help you assess how well you're doing with the hazard perception. They also generally have question and answer books (the ones which crop up in the theory). 

Dealerships generally won't carry much less than around £2k because they aren't worth it too them. By the time they do the required work and store them then sell them on the bikes often end up owing them money. The other side of it as well is that dealers will always ramp their prices up. So a £1500 bike becomes a £2k bike. ebay and stolengoodsareus.com I mean gumtree are only as good as the people selling on there. Its really just a medium to find private sellers. Buying a used bike is like buying a used car but there is a lot too look out for. Have a look round on autotrader. Make sure you HPI any bike you're interested in buying.

null,false,storylinker,null,null,null,"I've done it all, rented from a private landlord directly, rented from a letting agent, and now I rent out properties as a private landlord in Scotland. Here are some tips.

All landlords must be registered on this [government site](https://www.landlordregistrationscotland.gov.uk/Pages/Process.aspx?Command=ShowHomePage). All landlords should provide their registration number to you on their adverts. If they don't, you can still request the number from them. If they don't have one, they are breaking the law.

Normally tenants give 30 days notice to terminate their lease, so the first few days of March is when most flats would theoretically become available for 1st April. If you go via Gumtree, you'll actually find that many flats will also become available in the last week of March. 

When I rented from a letting agent, the basic process was: book viewing appointment, turn up and have a look, go away and think about it for an hour or two, call the agent to say I wanted the flat, then come into the agent's office to pay the deposit and sign the lease, etc. The agent will then meet you on the first day to hand you the keys. Aside from the company called ""Grant Management"", most agents are decent enough and will get the job done. 

When I rented from a private landlord, it was the same basic process. But as you say, there is the possibility of a scam, but if you check the landlord in the register beforehand, it shouldn't be a problem to pay a deposit by cash/cheque but you must sign the lease at the same time, and with witnesses if possible. UK leases have signature boxes for witnesses.

As a private landlord who advertises on Gumtree, I make appointments on a per-person basis, although I also schedule 1 hour open viewing sessions. I normally ask people to have a think about the flat after the viewing. If they call me up later and say they want the flat, I make an appointment to sign the lease, usually at the flat. I expect to be paid the deposit and the first month's rent at the same time as signing the lease. I issue receipts and your deposit is usually lodged with the deposit company within a few days. If it is possible, I usually hand the tenants the keys at the same time because as far as I'm concerned, everything is officially done and the flat is theirs. 

Since you seem to have a limited amount of time, you pretty much have to accelerate the process and get your signature on a lease as quickly as possible. Being out of town will make it almost impossible to secure a proper lease.",null,0,null,1423264857,null,0,1423265178,0,codkogs,null,t3_2uz28n,null,t1_codkogs,null,t3_2uz28n,null,null,null,1424109323,null,1,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,1,null

Are you a fucking moron? Have done the research? Let's do some numbers.

A starter home within commutable reach of London is ~£200,000. With help to buy, you would be able to borrow 20% being £40k. You would need to stump up 5% being £10k. £10k. Not ""tens of thousands"" as you earlier claimed. £10k.

Now, if you use any mortgage calculator on the street, you'll know that you need to make roughly £40k household income to be lent £150k. It's roughly 3-4x salary on a 75% LTV. And even then he repayments are horrific, but affordable for a couple with £2,500 month income after tax. £40k (often joint) household income. £10k deposit. Do these sound like the kinds of people who have or who are able to save ""tens of thousands of pounds""?

So first off, you're just wrong. H2B is already helping the people you seem to think need it most.

Second, how far do you honestly want it to go? 40% loan with 0% deposit? Did you even know that it's 20% plus 5% deposit? Did you even run the numbers to see what that looks like in real terms? Or do you just believe that it should be ""more fairer"" by making the terms looser so anyone can take on a house with a £5k deposit? Do you think £5k represents financial awareness and a hard won piece of land? If you're not going to give a leg up to *those who try but still can't make it* and are going to instead just help others (i.e. Everyone) irregardless [sic] of their efforts to get on the ladder in the first place how can it be called anything other than a free handout?

The worst thing about this whole argument is that we actually agree. I think H2B is a crock of shit which is why I won't touch it despite being eligible, and we both think the underlying reasons why the market is botched are a lack of new builds.

I have had Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and Stress management and I am hoping to do an Exposure Therapy course. I am being treated for Work related stress and anxiety issues. The therapy is offered out of the blue as and when it is available.

I think I am on ESA but I don't know what those letters mean. I am in the ""Support Group"" No one has mentioned getting more money for any reason as far as I know.

A few months ago I realised that the sporadic support of the NHS although well meaning was never going to get to the root of my problems or to fix me. I had to do that myself. I went into the job centre and asked about a programme for people recovering from mental illness they had on their website but it no longer exists. The advisor was very kind but had nothing to offer. I am currently doing voluntary work with the foodbank, which is going OK but pushes me to my limit. It took me several months to be able to fill in a single application form to be able to do that.

I will be assessed by ATOS around October and probably pushed onto a job programme then. Last time I saw ATOS I had a panic attack and was ready to act on suicidal thoughts. The interviewer was very kind but I was probably acting very strangely, much more so than I know.

However, I have difficulty processing, times, dates and numbers, eg. at various times in the last week I have been unable to; subtract 6 from 8, retain a string of three numbers, or recount spoken information after 15 minutes, recall names of recent acquaintances or participate usefully in a group meeting. (I behaved like a fool and talked shit). I also write shit on Reddit.

I think that I present as normal and consider myself to be recovering but vulnerable. At the same time I also suspect that other people can see that I am crazier than I think I am and they just aren't saying so. After I have had a ""good day"" I think I was probably just being manic and weird.

As you can imagine this can be quite stressful. I am too young to have Alzheimer's, but I do think I have some permanent brain damage as a result of Complex-PTSD.

&gt; hate Jews and Christians 
  
  The Quran actually prohibits Muslims from hating both Jews and Christians, and describes them in postive ways. Similarly, many of the prophets of the two religions are equally admired and praised in islam, and no Muslim can be a true believer without accepting the original Torah given to Moses and the original Gospels given to Jesus.

&gt; support censorship and use violence. 

I know I personally couldn't give a toss what anyone wants to say, do or print regarding Islam, as long as I'm left alone to live my life as I see fit.

YEah, all rapists, fraudsters and general criminals are Muslims. /s

 Actually the Prophet (saw) was keen to stamp out corruption and fraud from his society, encouraging the earning of halal earnings and denouncing such things as lying, non-payment of debts owed, the breaking of promises and theft as grave sins.

Martinez furrows his brow, wondering what to do.  Suddenly he feels a hand on his shoulder.  He turns thinking it to be Mirallas or Kone, looking to sub in and make an impact.  But no - it's Hibbo.  He simply looks at him, nods, and says ""It's time mate.""

Before he can react, Hibbo subs himself in to a confused and panicked gathering of Blues.  He smiles wryly, and takes a throw in from Coleman.

He's electric from the first touch.  He zips by a confused midfield, into  the final third, looks at Skrtel and says ""say hi to your mum for me"" before blasting a Jagielka thunderbastard into the corner of the net.  Crowd goes wild, but is still somewhat confused by what they see.  

83rd minute.  Gerrard makes a shot on goal and Hibbo takes the Robles rebound.  He hits a pass up the field to Lukaku that's so perfect, Big Dunc cries.  Lukaku fields it, pushes up the field, but is triple marked.  All off a sudden he hears ""fancy a pass on yer right mate"".  He kicks it out to the right corner of the penalty box.  Hibbert comes screaming in, and hits the ball with such a force it would make Jairzinho quiver.  2-2.  Now Goodison is on their feet.  

92nd minute.  2 mins to go.  Gerrard has a free kick.  It's perfect.  Except for Hibbert jumping with perfect anticipation to head it away.  The ball lands at Baines feet.  Against all his instincts, he passes to Hibbo.  Hibs cuts up the field, slicing and nutmegging defenders in such a beautiful way that 10 attendees immediately become poets.

He finishes his Maradona esque run with the most cheeky of flicks, over the goalie who came out to challenge him.  Whistle.  Derby over.  Everton victors.

As they go to shake hands, Gerrard (who's sobbing) comes to shake his hand.  Hibs suplexes him deep into the Goodison grass saying ""Get yer feckin' face out of Goodison and don't ever come back.""

100 women in the stands immediately become pregnant.  20 years later, 15 of those children lead England to a World Cup.  

And the legend of Hibbert continues to grow.....

**Name of product**: Bravura London Salicylic Acid 2%


**Price of product**:  Usual price £9.59 although I got 30% off for a new year offer.


**Where did you purchase**: [Bravura London website](http://www.bravuralondon.com/skin-peels/salicylic-acid/salicylic-acid.html)

**Product claims**: ""Salicylic acid is a very effective ingredient for treating oily/acne skin types that are prone to open pores and blackheads. Because it has a larger molecular structure to Glycolic Acid it stays on the surface of the skin longer giving it fantastic pore clearing capabilities. As this is a daily use peel, it gives far better results on congested skin than a weekly peel.""


**About you**: Combination, PIE, prone to hormonal acne and dehydration, *very* mild erythematotelangiectatic rosacea.


**Your opinion**: New HG! I started as instructed, using it strictly for 2 minutes at first before increasing the duration daily. I find the biggest difference it makes is to my skin texture - it *feels* much smoother and my pores, particularly on my forehead, appear slightly smaller. I've used it daily for about 2 weeks now and will continue to do so. I know /u/pennypenny22 mentioned leaving it on overnight but if I leave it on for longer than the recommended length it tends to dry me out a little. The Bravura site mentions possible side effects of flaking, itchiness etc but I haven't had any of these; only when leaving the product on for longer than recommended as mentioned above, and then it's only mild dryness. It's helping to keep even the hormonal acne at bay (albeit slowly - there is definite improvement but I'm not out of the woods yet) and I find it very cost-effective for my needs, as I use only a little at a time (approx 2ml?), mainly around my cheeks and jawline. I pat it on with my fingertips and then go over my forehead and nose lightly afterwards. I rinse with plenty of lukewarm water and follow with aqueous cream to moisturise. 

**Ingredients**: Distilled Water, Salicylic acid, Propylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Hydroxide.

*Edit*: A typo - I definitely don't use as much as 5ml!",null,0,null,1423266563,null,0,1423321589,0,codlkin,null,t3_2lo783,null,t1_codlkin,null,t1_clwl573,null,null,null,1424108421,null,3,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,3,null

I posted this months back it is carefully sourced, i will put forward the argument that the the Civil Rights movement and the NICRA was the product of the IRA, symptomatic of their changing focus of the time.

--------------------------------------------
Those tumultous times have been re-interpreted, revisited and rehashed multiple times all in the service of revisionism; i.e to serve today's political agenda. There will of course be people involved in the NICRA who have vastly different opinions about the nature of the movement. There are those with their own agenda and that includes the current Sinn Fein, but to deny their involvement and more so their importance is an absolute absurdity. It is quite clear from documented evidence that the IRA had undergone a massive change after its failed border campaign. It had a lot of internal discussions and debate, theses debates led directly to the formation of the The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Movement (NICRA)

&gt; The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (Irish: Cumann Chearta Sibhialta Thuaisceart Éireann) was an organisation which campaigned for civil rights in Northern Ireland during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Formed in Belfast on 9 April 1967, the civil rights campaign attempted to achieve reform by publicising, documenting, and lobbying for an end to abuses in areas such as housing, unfair electoral procedures, discrimination in employment and the Special Powers Act. **The genesis of the organisation lay in a meeting in Maghera in August 1966 between the Wolfe Tone Societies which was attended by Cathal Goulding, then chief of staff of the IRA.** The hope of the IRA, which four years earlier had ceased military operations after the failure of its Border Campaign, was that out of the already-nascent civil rights movement in Northern Ireland begun in 1963-4 by the Homeless Citizens' League and the Campaign for Social Justice there would arise a campaign of civil disturbance which would assist its efforts to unseat the unionist government in Belfast, and that the creation of NICRA would enable it to direct that campaign's course. Although socialist republicans and one IRA member were among those involved in the creation of NICRA, the IRA did not direct it.^[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Civil_Rights_Association)

For further information about the initial meeting of the NICRA in Maghera;

&gt; NICRA itself originated at a conference of the Wolfe Tone Societies held in Maghera, County Derry, on the weekend of 13-14 August 1966. The societies had been created in 1964 out of the committees which were set up to organise the 1963 commemorations of the bicentenary of the birth of Wolfe Tone, the leader of the United Irishmen and martyr of the 1798 Rising. Their 'primary objective was a united, independent and democratic Irish Republic in accordance with the principles of the 1916 Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil'. Fred Heatley described them as 'an autonomous adjunct of the Republican Movement', and Roy Johnston called them 'a Fabian Society to the Republican Movement'.

&gt; The republicans were active in influencing the direction taken by NICRA as well as in its creation. Goulding himself was present at the Wolfe Tone Societies meeting in Maghera in 1966. To understand the significance of their involvement, however, and the direction in which republican influence took the civil rights movement, it is necessary to examine carefully the political strategy of the republicans in the mid-1960s. The abandonment of the 1956-62 IRA military campaign was highly ambiguous and from outward appearances it was possible to interpret republican actions as either preparation for a renewed onslaught or as a delicate operation to keep the movement together while its direction was fundamentally changed.
&gt; 
**Politics in the Streets:The origins of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland by Bob Purdie (1990)** ^[Source](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/purdie.htm)

The IRA strategy was to mobilize people around social issues, but steered clear of directly controlling organisations it had helped create. Nobody said the NICRA had a military wing, that is precisely the point, peaceful demonstrations where met with the full force of the state. The Level of violence unleashed shocked even the IRA who were ill prepared for such an eventuality, in fact it split over what to do in response.

The NICRA was a broad movement that had Moderate Unionists, Anarchists, Socialists and Republicans, it held the hopes of many for a better and more just society. It was a the reaction of the state who sought to smash the movement. It brutalised and slaughtered a peaceful movement over very reasonable demands. The actions of the IRA Leadership are clear, they had tried a futile armed campaign previously, it had no support and they wound it up. Their actions subsequently were to campaign in a peaceable manner in a broadbased coalition for positive change. They had not forseen the disproportionate response that the state would mete out, the Republican movement split over how to deal with the actions of the state. At the time Catholic areas were daubed with the slogan ["" I R A= I RAN AWAY""](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oVaUkHKOyLAC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=%22I+R+A%3D+I+RAN+AWAY%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L43qTZUV3f&amp;sig=sA0E69mRJSe9H169N1GTDoIZXAI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bJA2VPOoOMGa7gar84HoBw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20R%20A%3D%20I%20RAN%20AWAY%22&amp;f=false), they where sneered at for their inaction. It was the demand from the Civil Rights generation that brought the PIRA to fruition, the Catholic population would no longer traipse home from a march beaten bruised and dejected while their friends and comrades lay in pools of blood in the street.

It was Bloody Sunday that led a vast bulk of people to leave join the newly formed PIRA. The swansong of the NICRA was a march directly after Bloody Sunday in which 100,000 people attended; it was the last thing they ever really did. 

&gt; Despite such attempts to continue civil disobedience, the civil-rights movement floundered during 1971 and 1972. In January 1972 British soldiers attacked a peaceful demonstration, killing 13 civilians in what became known as ""Bloody Sunday"". NICRA organised a protest in response, in which over 100,000 people took part. This was, however, to be the organisation's last significant march; Bloody Sunday had “immobilised NICRA from returning to the streets”. As clashes escalated, London suspended the Northern Ireland parliament. This marked the end of the civil-rights movement and street politics. The Provisional IRA emerged as the dominant force within the movement, and Irish nationalism became the foremost political position for those seeking radical social change.


Here are some of the personal recollections of Peter Cosgrove (Peoples Democracy Member)
 
&gt;  The struggle for “Civil Rights” was intended to change this state of affairs.  The “Civil Rights” movement covered a multiplicity of Catholic nationalists, republicans, communists and ordinary decent human beings who actually believed in “Civil Rights”.
&gt; 
&gt; It seemed clear to me that trying to march from Belfast to Derry would cause problems for the Orange State.  So, I swaggered up Royal Avenue on 1 January, 1969.
&gt; We were a motley crew as we set off up Royal Avenue. Gery Lawless, Ireland’s best known Trotskyist had come over from London. So too had Bowes Egan, a writer and publisher.  Rita O’Hare, later to become a well-known republican was there.  So was Johnny Morrissey from Tipperary.  None of these folk were students. There were students on the march but they were probably outnumbered by graduates and people with no university background.
&gt; 
&gt; We were preceded by a posse of Unionists waving the Union Jack. They were led by Major Bunting who was, at the time, Dr Paisley’s right-hand man.  Oddly enough, the Major’s son, Ronnie who later became a prominent member of the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) was on the march.

It flung me into the air 'like a rag doll' according to witnesses, and I landed on the concrete and was unconscious, bleeding from the back of my head. 

I was taken to hospital in an ambulance, which I don't really remember, but I wasn't put in a neck brace. 

When we arrived, I was put onto one of those beds on wheels things, and left to wait in a corridor. For 4 hours. By this time I was conscious again and was in a huge amount of pain. 

I was finally examined and taken for X-Rays. I told them where the pain was - hip, ankle, head. They only x-rayed my hip, and told me it was fine. 

After another few hours of waiting around, a nurse attempted to clean the wound on my head. Unfortunately she couldn't find the cut as the blood was mixing in with my (dyed) red hair. So she just *gave up*. 

At the end of all this they discharged me and told me to 'stop at a petrol station on the way home and buy some paracetamol for the pain'. I couldn't even walk, my bf had to half carry me. 

1 day later I went back into hospital as I was throwing up, and the head injury leaflet they'd given me said I should go back to hospital if this happened. 

At this hospital (different to the first) they immediately put me in a neck brace. I had a CAT scan and more x-rays. Turned out if fractured my skull, hip, and ankle. 

So not only had the first hospital neglected to check my head and ankle, they'd missed the fracture on my hip which was the one thing they'd looked at.

I'm very much of the mind that there's no moral defence for meat consumption in modern Western society.

The meat industry increases the cost of living for us all, and it's simply not a nutritional necessity.

Personally I like the US system as it would play to my strengths more imo (I'm quite an all-rounder, and I don't really want to just study one subject at university but I have to here in the UK). But many prefer the UK system where you start earlier and begin to specialise earlier so you have a much more in-depth knowledge of your chosen major by the time you begin university. The U.S. High school system is also looked down upon in the UK (at least where I'm from). Things like the SATs and ACT that seniors in the US take would be pretty easy to a relatively large proportion of the students here (I know, I took the SAT and got 2400 when I was in my junior year). This is because we're generally 1-2 years further ahead than the U.S., having started at 4 rather than 5/6 and having more days in school per year (roughly on average the U.S. Schools have 3 weeks less per year, after 12 years of education that's an entire academic year less).

I usually watch a team or two in the championship each year as well as the prem. My interest is usually Liverpool related, as I'll be watching them because an ex-player or manager is there. If I can find time, I'll half follow some foreign teams and try to get an understanding of what they're about. It's a great way to pick up on some great under-appreciated players too.

Take Borussia Mönchengladbach and Bayer 04 Leverkusen for example. I started half following Leverkusen when Sami was in charge and watched a lot of their games last year. Which lead me to finding out their local rivals are Koln and Gladbach etc.

This year I've moved on the Borussia Mönchengladbach as their head coach Lucien Favre, plays the kind of football I enjoy watching.

It's usual for a US President to have first held office in a state (often as governor).  Since most state governors have a four-year term, and a successful governor will be re-elected, that's eight years of political career spent away from Washington.

There isn't such an expectation in the UK.  Because of the extremely centralized nature of British politics, it's possible to quickly build a career at Westminster as an MP, then a minister (or shadow minister).  In addition, frequent ministerial ""reshuffles"" make it possible to be promoted between ministerial offices very rapidly.  For example, John Major became an MP at 36, a minister at 43, Foreign Secretary at 46, then Prime Minister at 47.

The UK is far more liberal than the US. Over here, you can't be the second party in a two party system by essentially holding to traditional values. As scary as UKIP may be, they are a sideshow for the moment. There is no inherent value, then, in being older.

Also, the UK does not have minimum ages for getting into politics. It used to be that some gentlemen would give their sons a seat in the commons as a rite of passage style gift (Charles Stewart Parnell, Robert Peel etc), so MPs have normally been starting out quite young.

It has a somewhat steep learning curve, and can be frustrating to initially pick up as people often find it difficult to get a save going without being fired (everyone gets fired from the their first try), but it is a very rewarding experience (and crazy addictive) once it starts to go right.

null,false,OhMyLumpinGlob,null,null,null,"&gt; saying that they're doing other stuff doesn't counter that.

Yes, it does. What do you think they're doing, sitting around twiddling their thumbs? Also, a great many of them are in committees, doing the important things that are relevant to those committees. These literally happen at the same time as debates in the chamber. Should they ditch those responsibilities to go sit in on a debate they have no reason to attend? They're representing their constituents in those committees too. And when they're in their own constituencies, they're out talking to their constituents, local businesses, councillors and the like getting the information they need to represent their constituency in debates, committees and to their parties.

Most debates are simply *unimportant points of order* that don't require anyone who isn't heavily involved in the particular piece of legislation being debated to be in attendance. Every piece of legislation goes through several of these debates and readings, most of which will be reviewed by the relevant ministers/shadow ministers in preparation for the party line. I can guarantee that when it comes to an actual vote on a subject that the main parties aren't in agreement on there is a much higher turnout.

The reason we have a party system is to free up the time of individual MPs so they can actually get stuff done. Without these mechanisms the government of this country would grind to a halt.

I think perhaps your opinion of debate turnouts is coloured by your prior opinion of politicians in general.

Well my apologies then. You're obviously a genius who is able to sort out anything they're likely to come across with such vast experience and a BTEC in answering phones.

Oh dear. Please don't do any business ones. You have nowhere near the experience required.

&gt; and he has been working in computers longer than your trolly 5 year old ass has been.

Possibly, possibly not. If he's not much older than you then not is a pretty good guess given I let my MCSE lapse before you even left primary school.

Giving you a dose of reality before you go learn an expensive lesson. The guy who fucked up my wife's works LAN because he had as much knowledge about them as you is currently being sued.

Both. If you live in an area with cable, which the majority of the UK doesn't, its connected with the cable company. Otherwise for the rest of the UK its connected with the phone company.

Normally don't like to comment, but this statement caught my eye.

Part of his argument is that modern culture requires everyone to have a clear-stated, unequivocal argument complete with immediate action items, an 'us-vs-them' battle plan where any ambiguity is considered a meaningless waste. One of his theses is that this reduces modern culture and psychology to a Manichean struggle, where the individual must join a cause, lest 'the other side' win.

His argument is twofold, 1: this is a Hegelian dialectic, one which actually can blind an individual to other contradictions or options, and 2: it is this dialectic that engenders the loyalty to 'cause x' or 'party y', which becomes a self-reinforcing principle.

So assuming that you are not barking mad enough to believe that literally, what really is the explanation for original sin? 

Secondly, punishing someone for something that they have no control over is not an act of love.  It's like an abusive husband battering a baby and then screaming at his cowering wife ""Look what you made me do!"" Of course if you ask the wife about it, she will tell you that he does love her and he has promised that it will all be better if she just worshipped him more.

Now you could argue until the cows come home about whether ultimately letting people follow through with their own goals even when the outcome is known to be awful is loving or not but intervening in that would undermine the concept of free will and the entire theological reason for existance A sort of 'Why build people when you could just build praying robots?'",null,0,null,1423297310,null,0,false,0,codxqrn,null,t3_2uyzlo,null,t1_codxqrn,null,t1_codxf1b,null,null,null,1424096785,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,thedingoismybaby,cnty-england,Invicta,null,"On average you'll have one or two armed units per division, made up of two or three officers. Most forces have two or more divisions. They are ready to respond to firearms incidents primarily.

They are probably costing around £50-100 an hour to staff (average officer pay £21 an hour in 2010 [Source PDF](http://www.met.police.uk/foi/pdfs/disclosure_2013/feb_2013/2013010001684.pdf)) and need to be available 24/7.

Let's say one unit (3 officers at £21/hour) per division, three divisions per force, **that's £1.6 million pounds a year just to staff a basic armed response capability per force**! (See [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2v2rr1/police_officers_carry_guns_to_routine_callouts/codywse) for reasons why they need so many officers)

At a time when police budgets are being slashed by millions of pounds and some forces are reducing front line numbers you can see why having two or three cars full of officers doing nothing is seen as wasteful. 

Would you rather call in a fight outside your house or someone trying to break in or any emergency really and have a firearms unit turn up within 10 minutes or an unarmed unit turn up in 20 whilst a firearms unit is available and closer. 

Full disclosure I'm a police officer. I've turned up at crashes, burglaries, domestics, fights and so on with armed officers. They don't draw their guns (unless necessary, I've never seen it) and I've never had a complaint from the person we're responding to - all they want is an officer. 

This is not a slippery slope, this is cash strapped forces trying to use resources more efficiently.

It's a replacement of faith in a god, not with rationality or objectivity, but with faith, even more blind and misplaced than before, in other people.

As a more practical example, in the past atheists would still disagree with, but nevertheless seek to learn about, Christian answers to the problem of evil (called a Theodicy). Now, new atheists simply either think that an (actually) 3,000-year-old objection is original, or that there is no answer to it at all anyway, based on their own uneducated and misplaced faith in some others people's conclusions, rather than any actual knowledge or attempt at understanding.

But god supposedly could stop babies getting bone cancer (for example) but chooses not to do so. If I love someone then I would do whatever I could to stop something horrible happening to them.  

&gt; Original sin represents the ability to choose rejection of God 

But the baby with bone cancer doesn't hasn't even develop the understanding to make that choice. It just gets the suffering. 

&gt; The fall represents the inherent rejection, that 'Everyone is born atheist' line. Sure you can look at it retroactively and say 'Well it turned out bad so I must be being punished' but actually people are getting exactly what they wanted.

I go back to the comment about the abusive husband holding the battered baby shouting ""Look what you made me do"".  

&gt; Now you could argue until the cows come home about whether ultimately letting people follow through with their own goals even when the outcome is known to be awful is loving or not but intervening in that would undermine the concept of free will and the entire theological reason for existance A sort of 'Why build people when you could just build praying robots?'

The baby doesn't get chance to follow through with its own goals, it just gets the cancer. Meanwhile those of us who develop enough understanding are supposed to regard this as the action of a loving god and worship him (or risk even more eternal suffering after we die)?  If we are to accept this explanation of god, then the only people who truly understand him are the Westboro Baptist Church. As Steven Fry points out, the only sort of god that would behave in this way would be a truly horrible one.

For the Greens? I think it's more that they lack the representation or candidates in many boroughs, when it comes to MEPs UKIP have way more, which to be honest, was how I think most people thought about UKIP until very recently, a [quick look](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_European_Parliament_for_the_United_Kingdom,_2009%E2%80%9314) suggests we've got something like 5 times more UKIP/IFEP than Greens.

Whilst they've got only twice the number of MPs, it's more that they've had the *grass root* support based on their simple protest against EU, this has then become more of a protest against immigration, hence why we see their local government seats.

When it comes to parties, you can certainly get a catch-22 style setup, no one votes for them, they get no press coverage because no one votes for them.

I honestly don't think that is the case for the greens, they've never been 'mainstream' enough, their communications, frankly are terrible, just see the IAmA from last week, confusion over things like basic income.

UKIP on the other hand worked quite well, they appealed to a bunch of people on a key issue that didn't really require much definition.  When it comes to communication, they did quite well, 5-8 years ago UKIP was being labelled only really negatively in the press.  10 years ago, as a society, I think we really made a mistake labelling people who were say xenophobic, disliking any kind of social change, as racist.  This I think was terrible, because people felt they had no right to complain about their local environment changing, without been labelled a racist.  The consequence of this is many people feel that it's OK to be fringe racist, because the term has been applied inappropriately.

null,false,CarpeCyprinidae,null,null,null,"Multiple strands of investment is my solution and it gives multiple payoffs in different time zones

I buy cars for £1000 to £3000 and they last a few years without trouble (last one lasted 8 yrs, current one is still OK after 3 years) - so I save £30/month in a 1.6% ISA and this means I always have cash to get another car when needed

Into the same account I pay £70/month and this pays for my tax disk and car insurance annually

5% TSB account, pay in my rent  + phone bills + 10% monthly and pay the d/debits for them from there, means once a year I can have a month without work with no issues (I'm a contractor, typically get 11 months work a year)

These very short term investments give me pleasure and enjoyment through security - the interest earned is negligible in the big picture but does help. The biggest benefit is turning annual bills (car tax/ins) and periodic large costs (car purchases) into affordable monthly sums

Salary is paid into a 3% Tesco account and I pay on 10% less than I receive every month my my main bank account to cover expenses (If the balance reaches the upper limit of the amount Tesco pay 3% on I transfer the excess to the ISA) - having a small undrawn reservoir of earned salary means I have an emergency fund on top of my rent and costs reserve

And for the longer term, every month I  pay as much as I have left over into longer term investments - I split between A+-rated loans on Fundingcircle and a FTSE 250 share tracker ISA - and these sums although currently not large, grow continuously and will be investments I sustain for as long as I can afford to do so. I see them as the underpinning of my future wealth

I had a lot of debts and I've only just got them all paid off through using strategies like these to manage my finances sustainably and insulate myself from sudden expenses  

I already enjoy the feeling of security it brings. Not feeling like you are on the edge or running on borrowed credit is also enjoyable.

My dad saw swathes of impressive buildings and tenements torn down for multis, cheap housing and other tack, packaged as progress.

I've seen Dundee as a grim place which is now finally getting some confidence about itself, the waterfront is creating that, or it is a result of that.

In all that time - the Caird Hall has stood.

Maybe we should make all our buildings as solid, permanent and as impressive looking as the Caird Hall and then perhaps we won't have to keep having infrastructure renaissances in this bloody town.

On the one hand, if Curtis' is merely striving for the television equivalent of a philosophy lecture, it seems slightly manipulative to disguise the whole thing as a strict historical analysis or a traditional documentary, which at times he does. On the other, if he is commenting on the flawed nature of modern discourse, and its over-reliance on simple narratives (which as I mention in the piece, are no more or less complex than those provided in WW1 or during the Crusades, or at any other point in history), then why does he only mention it at a couple of point in the film?  And is that not a 'point' in and of itself?  Not every programme or pundit must describe exactly what is wrong, and tell us exactly what to do to fix it.  I think in some cases (politics, economics) it is helpful if authors present a potential solution within their work, because it can make it easier to decide what to do next, but I certainly don't think it's necessary.  But, at the very least, any work must have some kind of hypothesis, some kind of point, and that's not strictly Hegelian at all.

The premise is thus: Stephen Fry has died and has arrived at the pearly gates (I assume that to mean heaven). God himself is there to speak to him.

In this hypothetical situation, Stephen, who has always struggled to understand why a omniscient, benevolent and omnipotent god would allow such injustice in this world, suddenly sees that there really is a god and this god is available in the flesh (so to speak) right here and right now for discussion.

So Stephen asks god about the thing that has most perplexed him about the universe, possibly the one thing that has stopped him from becoming a believer. He asks [paraphrasing], ""please, god, why do I see innocent children dying? Why do I see innocents killed by natural disasters? Please, now that I am dead, please could you explain to me how this all fits into your plan?""

That is exactly what a reasonable person would do. It is akin to a scientist seeing evidence that contradicts his established theory asking, ""why has this happened? Why did previous evidence support my theory but this evidence does not?""

Riding at night without lights is stupid, but people do lots of stupid things. Then again, I'd guess people who feel safer riding on pavements don't feel they need lights because they're not on the road anyway.

Why do they undertake? - Undertaking is pretty much encouraged in cyclists - you're told to stay left, you're given thin strips of painted lane on occasion, you have filter lanes up to the ASLs - it's like you're given a tiny little space in the gutter. Once you're in that mindset you're not undertaking.. you're just riding where you're ""meant"" to.

Why do cyclists run red lights? Well when you're treated like shit on the road and made to feel like you don't belong there with cars constantly shoving you over into the gutter, maybe you don't want to stop at a red light which bunches up a load of cars behind you.. it's nice to have a little free road up ahead - you get to feel safe for a few seconds before the next car starts tailgating you. Maybe it's just that when you treat cyclists as not part of traffic and an obstruction, they stop behaving like they're traffic?

Of course, no matter how things improve, there will always be some people who ignore the rules. However, that's nothing to do with people riding bikes - that's just what some people are like.

For the record, I commute to work by bike and I have lights, a hi-vis jacket with reflective strips, I wear a helmet and I stop at red lights (although there is one I ignore because it's not triggered by a bike and I'm not going to sit there for 10 minutes while I wait for a bus to trigger the line - it's a bus lane turn), I signal my intentions and I look over my shoulder when I change lane.

null,false,MrFlabulous,,Glorious People's Republic Of Asbostan,null,"&gt;Unfortunately the economic bottom line prevents the ideal conditions from being the norm. 

Of course it does. Current ethical standards allow for a bare minimum of humane treatment (in my opinion) and even then many suppliers and providers fly as close as they can to that limit (sometimes beyond) because they cannot afford to do otherwise. When Tescos and the like pay dairy farmers so little that they make a loss on the herds they keep you know something's wrong, and those that manage to stay in business somehow are often *thought* (no source to hand) to break the law in order to do so.

Nobody should feel guilty about having meat in their diet. And given the current economic climate it's understandable for people to seek out cheaper food. But my beef (ho ho!) is with the supermarkets that practically force farmers into unethical standards so that they (the supermarkets) can still turn a profit.

Where we (the public) come in is our use of supermarkets because they are cheap and convenient. We are content to not question where our food comes from as long as it looks nice.

There is no doubt that animals reared for food deserve as decent an existence as we are able to give them, but the truth is that the majority don't get that. The truth is that standards are set too low, and farmers (in order to stay in business) don't always adhere to those standards either, because otherwise they cannot sell their product at the measly prices the supermarkets set. And supermarkets are too willing to buy food from overseas at an even lower price, where standards may be even lower. I have no idea how cows in Argentina are treated, but Argentinian beef flies off the shelves of Tesco and Sainsburys.

And how can you limit these occasions? I agree the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes was wrong and there should have been punishments, However, the number of times armed police use their guns is incredibly low, and the number of times people are fatally shot is even lower.

For instance, since the year 2000, [only 12 people have been fatally shot.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_killed_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_the_United_Kingdom) 9 of those fatally shot were between 2008 and 2012, [where armed police opened fire on 18 occasions (scroll down to the trigger happy section.)](http://www.channel4.com/news/police-fatal-shooting-trigger-happy-fact-check) In 2011/12 armed police were used in authorised operations 12,550 times. [Out of those, firearms were discharged only 5 times and only 2 people were fatally shot.](http://www.channel4.com/media/c4-news/images/police_guns_x.jpg)

The British Overseas Territories that are tax havens.

&gt; The OECD has already published some workable and perfectly sensible solutions to deal with international tax avoidance, is he proposing the adoption of those rules? Is he talking about pushing the EU to adopt them, or trying to convince America to stop their ridiculous double-taxation policies or taking any other concrete steps to actually fix it?

He's going to demand that these tax havens reveal the owners of the companies based there, so HMRC can investigate if they owe any tax to the UK government, it will mostly stop tax evasion rather than tax avoidance. 

&gt; No, he's not. He's just talking tough because it's a soundbyte. He could have a bill in Parliament by the end of the week if he wanted it, but he doesn't, he just wants a stick to beat the Tories with

Labour aren't in power at the moment, so you can't really blame them for the fact nothing is being done right now. They could put a bill before parliament next week for the Tories to vote down just to prove a point, and perhaps they will, but what they're doing now is making a pledge for what they will do if they gain power - that's a pretty fundamental part of the way our democracy works.

&gt; I wish he was taking a principled stand. I wish he were actually going to act on those principles, but he's not, it's just politics as normal.

Richard Murphy, probably the most prominent anti-tax-avoidance campaigner in the country, [has written about why it is significant](http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2015/02/07/why-ed-milibands-tax-haven-announcement-is-significant/).

I like in Fjärås, a small village south of Gothenburg. There are a *lot* of farms around, and many people have horses for leisure purposes as well. Now I don't like horses particularly, and I like horsey people even less, as the shrinko pinko in me views the possession of horses as a class thing. Little Petronella or Primula orf for her pony ride or gymkhana, that sort of thing. But I know a miserable horse when I see one, and there are a *lot* of them here. They stand forlornly in muddy, sometimes waterlogged, fields with no grass anywhere, eating sileage. They are in pretty unpleasant conditions. If this happened in the UK then someone would probably call the RSPCA. But no, animals are kept to bare minimum standards because it's convenient (and cheaper) to do so.

It's not the most extreme example, of course, but it's an example of how the lines have become blurred *at least in Sweden*. But ANY animal that has been bred for a specific purpose, be it cats for companions, horses and ponies for little Funkadella, rats for scientific research or sheep for slaughter, ANY animal at least deserves our respect, thoughtfulness and ethical consideration. Perhaps our thanks as well, but maybe that's just a little bit wierd.

A lot of the time it's about HOW you write your application and the wording you use. 

Think about absolutely everything you've done in those 4 years, write it in bullet form or however you want - word it so it sounds magnificent.

The idea that car drivers and cyclists are equivalent road users is pernicious nonsense. Cars are multi-tonne, high speed killing machines. Their operators should be (and are) held to much higher standards than cyclists or pedestrians.

That's *car drivers* causing an accident by not driving defensively.

That said I have been in cabs where they have been wayyyy to close to a cyclist to the point where I make a noise indicating my discomfort. 

I've also indicated my discomfort at courier twats on bikes weaving between 1ft clearance on converging busses then moving laterally over 2 lanes to mount the pavement to move over to another road or insisting on trying to go faster than the slow but moving traffic and creating stupid situations that don't need to exist.

I've had cyclists come storming from nowhere down the inside as I turn left and I've sometimes failed to see a cyclist who was going straight on when I was turning right and had to brake harder than i should have and put my hand up to show i've seen them in apology. 

I've stepped out in front of a cyclist crossing the road (stationary cars but 15mph bikes are a pedestrian nightmare!) and come close to being taken out on several occasions by cyclists storming a green man at a crossing.

Our whole terrace ran forwards (we'd all been tucked back a bit because of the rain) and we went mental.

But the crux of the point is the same, whether you want to ask it nicely or be accusatory. And how you put it will surely depend on your mood. For example, if you had just lost your child to bone cancer, and the next day you died and met god, you might be pretty pissed off about it.

To me, standing by and allowing evil to occur while one has the power to stop it is just as bad as doing the evil oneself. I apply this principle to humans and I damn well apply this to god too, if such a thing exists.

So when someone is a twat on a bicycle, they are most likely going to hurt themselves.  This is why being a twat on a bicycle should be a lesser crime than being a twat in a car.

The fact is that cycling has many benefits for London, it will help us meet air pollution targets, help us reduce congestion (we can't nock down the buildings, nor expand the roads, but you can get a lot more people on bicycles than you can in the same road on cars).

We really need to try and get more people used to casual cycling in London, the borris bikes have not broken down the mass off older / or unfit people.  I know quite a few people who've never used them, they don't think it's safe.

We can definitely help this by having better infrastructure, segregated.  We could also let police have the power to not fine, but mandatory cycle proficiency training too, try and help educate the worst cyclists on the road.

However, when it comes to the police reaction in that assault, they didn't press it, as they would have had to have shown enough evidence for assault with deadly weapon.  I think the law needs to be clarified there, making it easier to bring such prosecution.

null,false,PhillippeTheCat,null,null,null,"Understood - it sounds like a permanent arrangement too, that's what I was trying to get at. In that, if it's temporary you'd probably leave it at that; as the higher paid member of Staff is likely just 'finding their feet' in the company before moving into their proper higher paid role. (I mean this, in that I train my boss to use certain software - she earns more than me, because she does more stuff however, I have to fill the gaps and provide training too? Just as I'd expect from other colleagues when I don't have a niche bit of knowledge.)

However, if the new member of staff is holding a permanent position, which is essentially the same particulars as your girlfriend, the company's putting themselves on thin ice. And I'd want to challenge the rationale for this.

The delivery of a message affects the reaction too. I'd not fire into the boss's office with a copy of the Equal Pay act in hand. I'd raise the concern on an email (keep copies) and retain a pragmatic approach. It could be a mistake, a case of the left and right hand not knowing.

Outline concerns in an email, and provide a solid rational such as:

- is it a discrepancy?
- have they got a certain qualification your girlfriend can demonstrate professional expertise in place of?
- can a job evaluation be conducted?
- why would the company recruit into 'her' job role, and change just the title... is this a redundancy situation? It's strange to change a title and retain everything else between two clearly similar jobs.

Could she be being pushed out of the company? That could constitute to an unfair dismissal too. (usually this involves taking on a cheaper member of staff though - only your girlfriend knows the true situation in terms of this.)

Maintain dignity, and keep a level-headed approach - your girlfriend needs to show she's got a solid rational, and needs answers.

Notice that he says ""the loonies out there in the cycling world"". He does not suggest that everyone in the cycling world is a loony and like the isis of London. He specifies that there are some in the cycling world who are loonies (and he's right) and they are like the isis of London. Tasteless comparison perhaps, but obviously an exaggeration for effect.

The telegraph has done the equivalent of getting a quote, ""the extremists out there in the British Muslim world, they are like the isis of the UK"" and cutting it down to ""British Muslims are the isis of the UK"".

How can you reject or betray something if you are not even aware of its existence? How could a loving god create a baby with that burden placed upon it? The whole concept of original sin is not compatible with the concept of love in any sane understanding of what love is. 

&gt; That story also contains an element called remorse and/or recognition of guilt.

What is the baby guilty of, and how could it be able to recognise that guilt or feel remorse? Or are you saying that the rest of us should feel remorse for the baby getting cancer? We are back to ""Look what you made me do"" again. 

&gt; You are imposing the nature of man onto God... 

I am trying to impose the nature of love on to your concept of god, and quite frankly it doesn't fit. You are refusing to question the possibility that your concept of god is anything other than perfect despite all the evidence to the contrary, and you resort to making excuses like the victim in an abusive relationship.

Attributing blame in these cases is really very complex.

I understand that most cycling incidents in London (I think it is actually different outside London) happen at junctions so efforts should be pointed there. Segregation on straight tiny roads will actually prob increase the cycle journey times. 

&gt; We really need to try and get more people used to casual cycling in London, the borris bikes have not broken down the mass off older / or unfit people

Personally I used to cycle many eyars ago until i came off (wet leaves) and a car passed a foot from my head. My internal risk analysis has come to the conclusion that biking is not for me, and anything with 2 wheels is not a smart way to travel.

Frankly in the urban areas I think cycling above 12mph should be totally illegal. A cyclist simply can't react fast enough to changes in the road surface or conditions ahead. I've seen plenty of cyclists go down in London with no cars anywhere near by. If there had been, their head would have been crushed (same for motorbikes). Also aggravating are the MAMILs with fully dropped handlebars who clearly have 0 peripheral vision who think they are in the TDF. Madness!

Further to that I have chronic asthma and have to medicate before any exercise, so it isn't for me for that reason.

The police on this issue were useless.

null,false,TheAnimus,null,null,null,"&gt; happen at junctions so efforts should be pointed there

A lot of these junction issues can be avoided by better design that is afforded by segregation.  It's very easy to give cyclists a few second head start and the like when it's segregated.  For instance my accident would not have happened if there was a concrete curb between the road and cycle lane I was in.  You then make it very simple as to who has right of way at a junction like that.  In London, my commute by car takes me 1.5+ hours, or less than 30 min on a bicycle.

&gt; Frankly in the urban areas I think cycling above 12mph should be totally illegal. A cyclist simply can't react fast enough to changes in the road surface or conditions ahead.

I think it depends, I find if I'm going at the speed for the traffic, I have less issues.  In most 20 mph zones, cars don't mind if you are doing 20 mph.  It's perfectly safe, just need to keep in mind weather conditions, and ensure you have a good 4 second distance for all this.

If you have cars following bicycles that can not stop before hitting them, then to me that is the problem.  Just as if the car behind me is driving to close that it hits me if I brake my car heavily.

&gt; Further to that I have chronic asthma and have to medicate before any exercise, so it isn't for me for that reason.

I've found since not cycling every day my asthma has greatly worsened.  I used to have to take a small amount of Seretide &amp; Salbutamol, but most days I'd get away without any.  However, Fexofenadine was required as mine was mostly allergy triggered.  But cycling most definitely helped, as would any cardio, it is just that cycling fits into your day, often making things quicker.  If I go to the gym for 1 hour a day, that's an hour 'lost'.",null,0,null,1423314484,null,0,false,0,coe113e,null,t3_2v2vjy,null,t1_coe113e,null,t1_coe0uxm,null,null,null,1424093665,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

These days it's a lot more complex than simply getting people to do a good thing by donating to charity. There are thousands of charities competing for funds. What fundraisers do is present a human angle and a story that the donors can relate to. It makes a difference having a third party tell the story, and makes the cause seem more credible if someone the donor can identify with or relate to is doing the asking.

The thinking behind this has been analysed and weaponised into the charity muggers we all hate. They're trying to do the same thing in under three minutes.

This seems to contradict your other reason for voting (electing the ""least bad option""), but if the only way my ideal party can have an impact is by winning and they have no chance of winning, then there is no good that comes from me voting for them...There's no good in them even running. Again, I do more harm by helping perpetuate the system, because there's no upside.

I was discussing this last night with some friends and the example we discussed as a shared experience;

&gt; I like the Jam house which although quite expensive tends to be a really good night with a wide mix of people and good live music. Not too long ago I went along for a friends birthday and there was an unusually long queue for the gents; when I got the line I realised that a man who was no more than 4-5 people in front of me in the queue to get in was there with a couple of friends supporting him vomiting in one of the sink and the urinals.
&gt; 
&gt; That had a detrimental effect on my enjoyment of the night out and definitely wasn't nice for the staff who had to clean it up then eject the person. It certainly wasn't from the alcohol he'd drank in the Jam house - unless he'd gone to the bar and downed a bottle of Gin - yet they had to clean up his mess. I agree he almost certainly shouldn't have been let in and the door staff messed up with not catching him, which is surely another argument for equipping them with the tools to help stop this happening and to protect other patrons.

Clubs have never been a service. It's not some public institute for the criminally drunk or chronically bad at dancing believe it or not. They are there to make money and to entertain and look after their customers. They have a right to refuse anyone, for any reason within the law. I don't have to let you into my house or place of business and neither do they. If they feel that someone who is incredibly drunk will cause a nuisance, and the fact they are under the influence of alcohol can be proven, it gives them better authority to refuse entry.",null,0,null,1423317194,null,0,false,0,coe1qmr,null,t3_2uz30z,null,t1_coe1qmr,null,t1_coe14jo,null,null,null,1424092996,null,0,false,brum,t5_2rdjk,0,null

The only places that have and can be described as 'adapting' are along the coast (the chip fab plant in Bary for example or in Pencoed - where most rasberry pi's are made, if you can believe it). Methyr is still stuck in the early 70'ies for example. Carephilly gets by on being a commuter town. It's depressing as fuck man. There have been a few attempts to get high tech into the Cwmbran valley, but its touch and go as soon as the subsidies run out.

The entire human geography of the valleys is still built around mining. There to date, and through now a generation of labour control has been little to no real change in this. Problem of course is mining stopped being economically viable over 40 years ago. 

And the attitude *i've* expereicened rightly or wrongly, is several large settlements to the north of the south, had their life blood ripped away from them unfairly. Not that, things just needed more transition time.

I mean I could rant all day about how devolution has accomplished next to fuck all once you drive 50 minutes from cardiff but thats another thing really. Why people keep voting for the party that habitually neglects them... what the fuck. No wonder so much of the valleys are UKIP targets...

But sorry the 'thatcher killed mining, things were on the up narrative'. I've never seen any evidence of that in nearly twenty years living here. Only the EU shitting money at Cardiff and Cardiff Uni going stem crazy for most of the 80'ies and 90'ies has net any real results (we were actually a semi-big deal in some of the earlier days of the net which has reaped real windfall - we'd not have the telecoms (all the call centers are strictly VOIP) banking or software industry we have without it).

&gt;

&gt;__Derby__ (^i/ˈdɑrbi/ *__DAR__-bi*) is a [city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom) and [unitary authority area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_authorities_of_England) in the [East Midlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Midlands) region of England. It lies upon the banks of the [River Derwent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Derwent,_Derbyshire) and is located in the south of the [county](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_counties_of_England) of [Derbyshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derbyshire), of which it is traditionally the [county town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_town). In the 2011 census, the city had a population of 248,700 and 1,543,000 in the wider metro area.

&gt;As home to [Lombe's Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombe%27s_Mill), the first factory in the world, Derby is considered a birthplace of the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution). With the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, and due to its strategic central location, the city grew to become a foremost centre of the British rail industry.

&gt;Today, Derby is an internationally renowned centre for advanced transport manufacturing, home to the world’s second largest aero-engine manufacturer, [Rolls-Royce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Group_PLC), and [Derby Litchurch Lane Works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby_Litchurch_Lane_Works)—the UK's only remaining train manufacturer. The [Toyota Manufacturing UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Manufacturing_UK)'s automobile headquarters is found just South of the city at Burnaston.

Maybe, but not necessarily.

&gt;Why is that more deserving of focus than the people actually doing stuff and proactively contributing to making the world a better place rather than facilitating it in a relatively minor yet high profile way?

The answer to that is because it allows the donor a closer link to the cause than they would have otherwise. The people doing the work can't do that and fundraise at the same time. So by making them feel important and fostering the link with the fundraiser, it makes them more likely to donate in future.

I write for a charity's magazine, so make sure that the front line work is focused on as much as the fundraising, but it's a part of the fundraising's marketing to nurture that relationship between donors and fundraisers too.

IMO no it does not have any particular benefits, the skin simply does not need the short to medium chain fatty acids found in coconut oil. However there is research showing refined coconut oil can penetrate hair, reducing porosity and hygral fatigue (water damage).

The skin can utilise other lipids such as ceramides, cholesterol, cholesterol esters, phytosphingosine, very long chain saturated fatty acids. Natural sources of these include lanolin, beeswax and lecithin. These lipids are particularly beneficial in atopic eczema and xerosis.

There is some research suggesting plant oils rich in linoleic acid (eg. sunflower, rosehip) may be beneficial where the skin barrier is damaged, in acne vulgaris and other inflammatory conditions.",null,0,null,1423320494,null,0,1423320823,0,coe2t8f,null,t3_2v33lf,null,t1_coe2t8f,null,t3_2v33lf,null,null,null,1424091984,null,3,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,3,null

On the game we were fantastic, we pressed for the full 90. I am particularly pleased that after we conceded the heads didn't go down we stepped it up and bossed the game. We have real side here lads, if we can keep this group together we can ein the league!! 

At the back Walker was absolutely solid arsenal barely got anything past him, Dier and Vertonghen were  fantastic I am particularly impressed by Dier a very accomplished performance for the young lad. 

In the middle mason was everywhere, and I Managed so happy we have Bentaleb back we so much better with him in the side.

I like Dembele at no.10 he adds a different dimension and we aren't disappointed by his distribution. I thought lamela did well but the kid still had a wAy to go. Eriksen was his usual energetic inventive self. And harry kane is amazing.

Not sure what the area is like there. Over here, as its a rural sort of town, and for some reason ideal for supported accommodation, there was a increase in supported living/carer/support positions after we were made redundant.  
Some colleagues went for them sort of jobs, but had to commit to a NVQ3, which you almost have. Not sure on the technical detail's about resuming it. Best ask FE office at a college  
What I'm trying to get at, is it might be worth sending a speculative letter to local supported living agencies/homes explaining your situation and experience. In fact, I'm pretty sure district/county council should be able to help too, in at least having details of places what are in this industry, as the councils do have to check up on them.  
JCP won't really consider paying for a course until you get to Work Program stage, and even then its going to be one of their 'approved providers'.  
TBH, it shouldn't affect your jobhunting, if you want to stay in that industry but the jobs require the qualification in their advert.

Rose got into some dangerous positions, always offering an outlet. Poor end product though, and got caught out for their goal, but you can't fault his work rate.

Mason was solid, he did misplace a few passes, but won possession back quite a few times. Bentaleb looked good, did the simple stuff right and nice ball for the winner. He can be liable to hash a clearance though. Dembele was pretty great, held onto the ball too long occasionally, but generally kept possession and created a few chances. Eriksen was pretty quiet, delivered a few great balls.

Lamela was pretty poor. Worked hard, but again, dwelt on the ball too often, and also lacked a bit of awareness taking shots off balance, when there were better players around him.

Kane was superb, obviously. Just always in the right place. He does need to watch the line slightly better in my opinion. Three times in the second half where he had a 1v1 but was called offside, that can cost games. But it is the NLD and he was fucking superb other than that.

* **First Utility** are cheap, although I've heard stories of people having trouble setting up accounts with them, they will take over your supply then stall for months when sending bills, their customer service is poor as well from most of the reviews. 

* **UWClub** (or something along them lines) are great, my parents are with them, never had a problem, bills on time in paper form or online. Great customer service although my parents never need to ring them, cheap monthly costs. 


There is a few more aswell, but these 3 stick out in my mind currently. I'm at work so its hard to find anymore. 

Personally, I'm with First Utility, (through no choice of my own, took them on with my tenancy) they are cheap so I had no reason to change. I've had issues with late bills, I currently haven't paid a bill yet but I'm saving the cash myself to pay off in full. 

Every time I've spoke to them they are helpful and have provided me with a price based on my meter readings. My issue is that the previous tenants didn't close their account so they are still getting billed, (first utility have 2 accounts for the same address). They have taken the readings for when my account started and are aware of what my usage is, not accounting any usage before my move in date. Its more laziness on my behalf for not chasing up my bills.

null,false,Ssoulle,null,null,null,"I think Morgan for sure as he can walk into the starting 11 of practically any team and im sure double / triple wages will be on offer which we just can't compete with. It seems the hype went to his head in the last year, remember when he said he would play for Southampton until he was told otherwise. 

I don't think Big Vic actually cares no where near as much where he plays, he walks into the Kenyan national team automatically and is probably really grateful just to be playing in England. He did go to play for Celtic after all.

Clyne is also probably gone, he has stalled his new contract and Man Utd are in the market, its just whether they meet our valuation for him, got to be 20m+ considering his age. The hype has got to him too it seems. Really they are the only top team who would suit him and are looking. 

Toby I don't know, I hope he stays as that rumoured 6.3m buyout clause seems like another steal for our defense. I have this odd feeling he is going back to Spain at the end of the season, I just get that vibe.

Jay Rod is a hard one, the only manager that will buy him no questions asked in the summer is Poch and I expect Spurs to be selling 2 of their 3 strikers in the summer if possible so I imagine he is high up on their shopping list. Will depend really what his form is like if he comes back at all this season. Liverpool of course are probably going to be selling Crapotelli and Lambert hasn't really worked out so maybe another 20m from them would be nice.

Hopefully we release Mayuka and our awful backup goalkeeper Gaz, I think we should use Youth only / Kelvin for backup keepers personally. Fraser is a big lad I don't think he gets injured much. Kelvin is basically goolkeeping coach now with the added benefit of being able to fill if required. I also think we should cash in on Gaston and Osvaldo as soon as possible, seems like we have to write both off as failures at this point.

Maybe in future [reply to me instead of yourself](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2v17ha/george_galloway_accuses_bbc_over_question_time/coe24s4), since that's generally how a debate works. 

And okay, terrorism can be vaguely defined by some people. How about we use the definition as provided by oxford dictionary. That seems fair, doesn't it?

&gt; [Terrorism: The unofficial or unauthorized use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims.](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/terrorism)

So we're in agreement that if someone attacks people like George Galloway because they want to stop him spreading his political message, then that is terrorism, if we are using the definition above. Correct?

We move onto you saying that you think some people deserve to be victims of such crimes, thus victims of terrorism. I find it utterly bizarre that you can claim that you think someone deserves to be a victim of terrorism, *whilst at the same time* being 100% opposed to terrorism. That is just totally illogical.

This is a model constructed by populus that takes into consideration previous national polls, constituency polls and Scottish only polls and it predicts that although the Tories will come out just ahead of Labour they will be incapable of forming a coalition that could form a majority within the House (due to the lack of partners as I said above). It suggests the most likely outcome at the moment is a Labour-SNP pact or failing that a Labour-Lib Dem one but the probability of a Labour government is higher than a Tory one.

People in the UK have gotten used to majoritarian government and therefore see our elections as almost presidential in the nature (he who comes first wins) but in a parliamentary system it is in no way a given that the largest party will get to form government if it isn't a majority because of parliamentary arithmetic. It's not a matter of if they *should* rule but if they *can*.

The Tories could try and run a minority administration assuming Labour don't try and take the government for themselves but with few potential partners they'll find it very difficult to get any bills or budgets passed and it would probably end in a vote of no confidence and a fresh general election.",null,0,null,1423323163,null,0,false,0,coe3tj7,null,t3_2uztnz,null,t1_coe3tj7,null,t1_coe1pjy,null,null,null,1424091034,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

EDIT: I'll update you guys on the City game if you'd like. 3 monitors in front of me. Watching City, Chelsea, and Real vs Atletico all at the same time right now lol. Just come back to this comment for updates. 

51' City are extremely lively and look threatening. 

53' Hull City have seemed to cool the storm

54' Dzeko has really nice chance, but McGregor makes a fantastic save.

55' Silva goes down easy in the box, **no** penalty is called. Pundits think it's a pen though.

60' Hull city have control of the game. 

64' City back at it, but Hull is standing very strong.

66' Milner in for Dzeko, Alluko out for Robertson 
Cit
IVANOVICCC &lt;3

69' Nasri's freekick is an easy save for McGregor

70' City counter quickly defused by Hull's defense. (Hull might win this *knocks on wood*)

72' Aguero had a chance, but was offside and had his shot blocked.

73' Hull's defense is absolutely rock solid right now. Hats off to them.

74' Jovetic in for Silva (why would they do that?)

75' N'Doye in for Ramriez 

77' City have control of the game, but Hull STILL standing strong.

Juan Cuadrado! Good luck buddy. 

80' Seems Hull are choosing just to park the bus

85' Hull City time wasting has commenced. 

89' Aguero hits the crossbar after a beautiful cross from Nasari (there is a god)

90' Quinn in for Brady

90' 4 added mins

[90+1 25 Yard freekick given to City](http://gfycat.com/HopefulHairyFrogmouth)

90+2 Milner scores the freekick. (FML)

null,false,Tophattingson,null,null,null,"&gt;Not going to happen. Bitcoin-type systems have far too many flaws to be widely adopted.

Bitcoin indeed, has many flaws. All of it's existing offspring have near-identical flaws. However, there is only 1 flaw that completely inhibits Bitcoin from being used as an effective currency. 

Right now, Bitcoin sees most transaction as a very short term unit of exchange. You buy Bitcoins for USD, buy drugs/guns/unspeakably awful stuff with Bitcoins, then the person who receives those Bitcoins quickly changes it back to USD. The other use of Bitcoins is by Bitcoin investors, who hoard it hoping that it will go up to insane values and that they will sell it before it collapses. This is, obviously, not an effective currency if everyone wants to either get rid of it as soon as they have it, or hold onto it forever.

This is mostly a problem of extremely high volatility, which is mostly a problem of very low volume of trade in Bitcoin. The reason for this very low volume of trade is that Bitcoin is, in the long term, inherently deflationary. It was DESIGNED to be inherently deflationary.

If there was a list of rules about how to manage an economy, rule 1 would be ""Do not cause deflation"" and rule 2 would be ""Do not cause deflation"". Bitcoin's deflationary nature gives everyone who owns it a reason to never, ever use it. If it will grow in value by doing nothing, why spend? And sure, the price goes up, but then we get volatility.

As almost nobody is trading Bitcoins at any moment (low Liquidity), a single person dumping a single wallet from the time when Bitcoin mining was easy, say, 50,000 bitcoins? That completely crashes the price of Bitcoins. The developer of Bitcoin is estimated to have in the region of Millions of Bitcoins and could destroy the entire Bitcoin market at a whim. That's not how a currency should function

This high volatility (and with it high risk) makes it near useless as anything other than an ultra-high risk investment or as a very short term means for exchange of illegal goods. Fixing these Cryptocurrencies is as simple as removing their inherently deflationary nature.

Another downside of it's design is that because it's vastly easier to mine coins early on, and hence rewards early adopters disproportionately, the currency takes on the appearance of a Ponzi scheme. Although likely not deliberately designed as such, it looks similar enough to discourage use and attract strong criticism from banks.

Why have it's supporters not fixed this yet? Probably because they like Austrian economics and hence deny that deflation is a bad thing.",null,0,null,1423324244,null,0,1423324571,0,coe49bl,null,t3_2v2x0i,null,t1_coe49bl,null,t1_coe2wgf,null,null,null,1424090615,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

Take the loophole Amazon exploit: their UK site pays a ""licence fee"" to Amazon.com for use of it's name. This fluctuates yearly and is pretty accurately aligned with profits. This is demonstrably bollocks, and deprives HMRC of much-needed revenue. 

Fixing that requires a change in International Accounting Standards, at least one major trade agreement (probably more), and for it to be effective for more than just US/UK companies changes in EU law. Essentially the more countries that get behind changes the easier it is to fix things.

As K-9 becomes possessed by a legendary evil and Romana is pulled into a shadow dimension, the Doctor plays a game with the entire history of the human race at stake...

**5th Doctor &amp; Vashta Nerada**: *Collector of Darkness* -
A nameless city deep in the Amazon rainforest. A missing research team. A UNIT division with a secret objective.

A mysteriously malfunctioning Tardis traps the Doctor and Mel in a pivotal point in history during the Eocene age, where the former rulers of earth, the Silurians, decide on what course of action to take as a rogue planetary body approaches... 

**7th Doctor &amp; The Wire**: *The Lost Broadcast* - The Tardis brings The Doctor and Ace to the studios of the BBC, where famous comedy duo Eric Morris and Dave Smart are preparing to film their latest Christmas special. But history said it never aired. And with faceless men wandering the corridors, alien machinery in the cameras, and otherworldy voices coming from the locked control room, it's no wonder. . .

&gt; Well as a taxi driver I have always thought McNamara was a publicity seeking bafoon. Firstly the LTDA had, the last time I took any notice of them, 6000 members out of 24000 cab drivers so although they always ‘big themselves’ up as speaking for the London cab trade in reality, and at best, they speak for a quarter of the trade. If only the LTDA had supported the Superhighway scheme whilst putting forward the case for the best possible taxi access. That was the only logical and sensible course to take. Instead, McNamara and his cronies have done nothing but engage in nothing short if a ‘hate’ campaign against cyclicts over the years in its paper ‘Taxi’.

Things I've tried:

Water eyeshadow - in a very pale champagne colour. This was… ok. It worked a lot better wet than dry. The colour didn't come out how I was expecting - it was very light, when I wanted something more pinky. I haven't worn it at all. if I do, I'll probably use it as a highlighter colour.

Eye shadow pencil in a purple colour. I bought this after I saw Lisa Eldridge use it in her purple smokey eye video. It's quite tricky to blend, so you have to be careful with you application, but the colour was fantastic and it lasted the whole night I was wearing it. Very good for special occasion / dramatic makeup.

Luxurious Lashes Mascara. I used this once, but it was too wet, and smudged / flaked a lot, and didn't hold a curl at all either. Would not recommend. 

Invisible powder. This is my favourite! It seems to be a translucent powder with silicon and no talc. I got it because my No7 translucent powder is making my face soooo dry, and although I don't need much powder I like a little bit now and then. I put it on today, and so far so good. It's feels very soft and doesn't look give that overly powdery look that I'm personally not a fan off.

I think it's quite fun to have a new makeup brand that doesn't have any firm favourites on MUA to have a play with!

how many seasons is it going to take before these players CAN be arsed every game? not to mention the arrogance of pellegrini. yes he's a great tactition and a great man manager but when it''s not a big game he doesn't seem to apply any meaningful tactics. it's more of a 'my players are better than yours' type of approach unless it's a big game. this obviously has an extra effect on the players mentality of 'we'll win it on quality alone and will barely even try'.

sometimes i wish i was in the dressing room to give some of them a good bollocking, simply not good enough sometimes. it's not a case of quality or decision making, it's a case of attitude and discipline. watch the tunnel cam and you see players like yaya who arent even arsed after loosing, then you see players like kompany who are absolutely furious with themselves. we've got a serious attitude problem and it's games like this that prove that.",null,0,null,1423327347,null,0,false,0,coe5npa,null,t3_2v3dl1,null,t1_coe5npa,null,t3_2v3dl1,null,null,null,1424089242,null,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2,null

The phrase most likely originated from The Derby, a horse race in England, founded by the 12th Earl of Derby in 1780, since at least as early as 1840 'derby' has been used as a noun in English to denote any kind of sporting contest.[citation needed] Another widely reported theory, though not accepted by the Oxford English Dictionary, is that the phrase came about from the city of Derby itself.[citation needed] It was renowned as the site of a chaotic and exuberant game that involved the whole town and often resulted in fatalities.

Great to have Ki back, and together with Cork the midfield looked solid. If you disregard the typical stupid yellow card of the oh so typical Swansea zeitgeist I think Cork did very well. Neither Barrow or Dyer had any real impact today, so it's good Montero is back. 

First half were dominated by stupid decisions, or just wrong decisions, in possession. This led to Sunderland having lots of the ball and the Swans lagging one step behind. The second half was much better, putting much more pressure on Sunderland forcing them back.

Gomis is... yeah. He didn't have the desire to get on the shoulder as much as I had hoped. His hold up play isn't always great too. I'd rather see him touch it back first time and run in behind, but too often he looks to turn. Even though he was offside for his obvious chance, he needs to be putting those away.

Great to have Ki back, Cork did alright. Naughton did okay too, I think he found it difficult sometimes because Dyer and Barrow kept coming to feet.

In the UK, eggs are sold as laid.  Removing the natural protective layer is not allowed.

**Positives:**

- Naughton just 'fits'. Looks to be a wonderful signing.

- Ki fantastic as always. 

- The passing was sensational at times, just missing the end product.

- Shelvey seems to be thriving at the Attacking mid position. He's a real threat when he isnt tasked with defending.

- Almost no shots for Sunderland. Outside of the Defoe goal they had no chances

- Barrow is officially PL quality in my books. Give him a couple years and who knows where he'll be

- Oliveira looks extremely lively out there. I thought he looked as dangerous as anyone.

**Negatives:**

- Gomis is an awful finisher.

- Gomis has the worst positioning I think I've ever seen

- Gomis has the touch of an elephant

- Teammates, mainly Dyer, seem frustrated with Gomis as well

- Why would we let Defoe just walk to the 18 and shoot? Awful.

- Fernandez has had better games

- Monks substitutions. Why take Shelvey off? He was still contributing? Risky to try Naughton at left back given his history there. Why not take Gomis out who has actively wasted our attacks?

**Reflection:**

A strong team performance derailed by a moment of idiocy and a bumbling idiot playing the 9 for us. I'd love to see how that game would have ended had we kept Jonjo on and Oliveira up front. The work rate is astounding on the Portuguese loanee and I look forward to seeing more of him. Overall, a fantastic performance that will maintain confidence in the locker room.

I'll admit it annoys me when people talk about how good Eriksen is at 88th minute goals, because there's a reason he can that. Because there's 9 other people on the pitch with him who are still pressing and running with him. The fitness is insane, on top of rarely many, if any, out with injuries.

Though to be honest, it's probably better that Poch goes under the radar for now. Keep the pressure off him, and keep letting him do his job and keep getting us wins.

They've also learned that our defense is suspect, especially on counters. So...pack the box defensively and counter when possible. Look at the last few games:

1) City 1-1 Hull (City 74% poss)
2) City 1-1 Chelsea (City 57% poss)
3 City 0-2 Middlesbrough (City 67% poss)
4) City 0-2 Arsenal (City 65% poss)
5) City 1-1 Everton (City 62% poss)

Teams are more than happy to let us play with the ball in midfield because our offense is anemic and our defense is soft. Possession % doesn't tell the whole story, obviously, but it does show that teams are implementing an obvious and consistent strategy that is WORKING.

MY PREDICTION IS:

Markovic is not starting. Balo is not even in the squad at all.

Stevie has a quiet game, Sterling gets frustrated with the Everton defense because he can't do it all by himself and Bredao hasn't put a striker on the pitch. Markovic comes on for Ibe at some point to try and inject fuel in the side. Attempts two crazy off balance volleys that look cool but are miles off target. Mingolet scares the shit out of our arse for the full 90 minutes and I watch the match from my toilet. Brendan puts Sturridge on with 6 minutes left in the match to try and save it, but he isn't getting any decent service because everyone else is too tired. Coutinho tries to thread 15 amazing passes up the middle and not a single one gets pass the Everton defence except for one that Sterling can't get a touch on and chases past the touch line. Lucas stalls the mid field the whole game ruining the fluidity of play and eventually gets subbed off for the amazing joe Allen. Moreno begs for a foul and rolls on the ground every time he is bumped so our attack from the left flank is weak except for his 3 crosses. All of which go over the crossbar. Skrtel and Sakho play solid. Can continues to make you wonder the whole match if he should really be playing CB and not taking Lucas' spot in the DM. Hendo runs the whole game and plays okay. All Ibe does is a few flicks tricks and loses the ball when the momentum of play is building up and gets tired. Lovren gets subbed on for Can and wins a header during a corner in the 90th minute which hits the crossbar. 

Match ends.

MY PREDICTION IS:

Markovic is not starting. Balo is not even in the squad at all.

Stevie has a quiet game, Sterling gets frustrated with the Everton defense because he can't do it all by himself and Bredao hasn't put a striker on the pitch. Markovic comes on for Ibe at some point to try and inject fuel in the side. Attempts two crazy off balance volleys that look cool but are miles off target. Mingolet scares the shit out of our arse for the full 90 minutes and I watch the match from my toilet. Brendan puts Sturridge on with 6 minutes left in the match to try and save it, but he isn't getting any decent service because everyone else is too tired. Coutinho tries to thread 15 amazing passes up the middle and not a single one gets pass the Everton defence except for one that Sterling can't get a touch on and chases past the touch line. Lucas stalls the mid field the whole game ruining the fluidity of play and eventually gets subbed off for the amazing joe Allen. Moreno begs for a foul and rolls on the ground every time he is bumped so our attack from the left flank is weak except for his 3 crosses. All of which go over the crossbar. Skrtel and Sakho play solid. Can continues to make you wonder the whole match if he should really be playing CB and not taking Lucas' spot in the DM. Hendo runs the whole game and plays okay. All Ibe does is a few flicks tricks and loses the ball when the momentum of play is building up and gets tired. Lovren gets subbed on for Can and wins a header during a corner in the 90th minute which hits the crossbar. 

Match ends.

The main doubt I have as to it's veracity is that the diary is very terse and monomaniacal. It doesn't read like a real person's diary; if you ever read published diaries of people like politicians, they tend to go into a lot of minutae about people's day to day lives - with visits to the pub and the cinema and chatter with their mates and catty opinions of their colleagues and whatnot, whereas this is purely a brief synopsis of police work, with some comment on the Troubles. Where's the guy's comment on his home life, or on his holidays to Skegness or on what idiotic things his dickhead of a commanding officer is asking him to do this week? Without that stuff, what's here doesn't really ring true.

It could be that everything that's not related to this guy's job has been edited out for twitter purposes, but that also makes this the sort of stuff that someone with a reasonable imagination and a fuckload of time and access to the back issues of a Northern Irish newspaper could concoct, if they wanted to (though why anyone would do that escapes me).

so when teams are sat deep we look for silva &amp; nasri... in response to that teams choke the life out of nasri &amp; silva so there isn't much creativity.

when teams defend very deep often times there is alot of sideways passing around the box, and when a ball does go towards goal it is often a slow cross or a 'forced' ball in. which easily gets cut out and cleared and we're back to square one.

yaya also has an incredible ability from outside the box, which is another main reason why he is so vital to beating teams who are sitting back defending. almost all if not all our players want to walk the ball in the net when the opposition is defending very deep, this is so hard it's not worth trying... the way to beat a deep defending team is long shots and yaya is brilliant at that, apart from yaya the rest of the players seem very reluctant to shoot outside of the box.

- Producing/processing class (professional skills, labour, work, specific knowledge)
- Various levels of managerial class
- Powerbroker class (Executives, leveraging, politics, **capital mainly for power as opposed to being  for indulgement** - this last point is crucial to understanding the true difference in class as compared to the feudal period.)

i.e. *Feudalism levels* of class. 

No, really.

""But... but... but we have houses, cars, TV's mobile phones, accessible infrastructure X etc...""

**NOW, SHUT UP AND LISTEN.** Having a *better* overall state without some of the technological, political and economic shortcomings typical of an historical era known for *inequality* does *not* necessarily imply that the contemporary society is *more equal* than the historical one.

In other words, just because you can point to ""possessions"" or ""availability"" doesn't make you ""middle class.""

*Jobseekers* can make good use of their smartphones.

Students with little can buy *aluminium* cutlery.

17 year old *labourer*s can buy and drive cars *faster than any horse-drawn carriage.*

A *farmer* can produce enough food to sell and eventually buy a decent house for himself. 

A *maid* can occasionally buy good, nutritious food for a tenner down the local gastropub.

Are any of the above activities *definitely* middle class?
What would count as a middle-class activity?

Class isn't determined by your surroundings. it is determined by your capital, influence and contacts, **relative to the rest of the society.**

For the *vast majority* of you who wish to fantastise about your ""middle class identity""...

It's probably not true. If you sell a skill and comprise the bottom brackets of the economy, then you are working/producing class, trappings be damned.

Azpi did well defensively, but thought we missed natural width on the left flank.. saying that he did get the assist. Hazard, Willian &amp; Oscar could link up a lot better. Hazard wasn't as direct today usual, seemed to be playing for fouls mostly. Oscar yet again was timid in attack, if only he would just be more ruthless he would be complete. Drogba had a bad game, just couldn't get things to stick. Though when you see Remy on, he doesn't do much better in that regard, it shows we really miss Costa he does a lot of work up there. Remy has good link up play on the ground however, and a threat on counters. Cleverely in League 1 sounds accurate. Willian seemed a bit more of a threat in attack, and worked hard, effeciently pressing as usual.

Most people like the idea of a basic income, the difficulty is in choosing how you can fund it large scale.  That money has to come from somewhere.

Also for many of the benefits people touted for universal income, £72 is simply not going to be remotely enough to top it up to suitable standard of living, say London.

We're doing okay.

Moreno has been the epitome of everything wrong with us in this first half. Poor attitude so far and no work rate. When he loses the ball or gets beaten, he doesn't track back leaving Sakho 2v1. Hell I've seen Stevie defend more than him!

Onto Stevie himself, he looks tired. Worn out. He's tried chasing dead ends but he doesn't have the pace to get on the end of them. Had that fantastic free kick too and you always need him on the pitch in a Merseyside Derby, but he hasn't been outstanding by any stretch.

Outstanding *is* a term I'd use for Jordan Ibe though (and Gareth Barry so far but fuck him), Ibe has been at the root of everything, running Oviedo into the ground, dragging 2/3 players out of position to try and close him down. 

Coutinho hasn't closed many people down on our side though, he's been quiet, hasn't been pressing their holding midfielders very much and hasn't been so creative. He can come up with some magic as always but it hasn't seemed likely so far.

The fundamental issue for us in attacking was very clear in the 42nd minute, when we had 5 players lining up on the edge of their box, putting on pressure, but nobody in the box. Everyone wanted to be the creator and nobody wanted to be the finisher and they just ended up running into each other or playing it out wide, until the wide player realised that there was no one in the box and then it just came back again.

Section 2. [**As an insult**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_sign#As_an_insult) of article  [**V sign**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%20sign): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The insulting version of the gesture (with the palm inwards) is often compared to the offensive gesture known as ""[the finger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_finger)"". The ""two-fingered salute"", also known as ""The Longbowman Salute"", ""the two"", ""The Rods"", ""The Agincourt Salute"", and as ""The Tongs"" in the West of Scotland and ""the forks"" in Australia,  is commonly performed by flicking the V upwards from wrist or elbow. The V sign, when the palm is facing toward the person giving the sign, has long been an insulting gesture in England,  and later in the rest of the United Kingdom; though the use of the V sign as an insulting gesture is largely restricted to the UK, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia.  It is frequently used to signify defiance (especially to authority), contempt, or derision.  The gesture is not used in the United States, and is archaic in Australia and New Zealand, where the [finger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_(gesture\)) tends to be used in such situations instead.

null,false,holamiamor,null,null,null,"**Dembele** – Not sure I’ve ever been more proud to call him a Spurs player. He really had a cool head, great feet, played really well when you look at how much Arsenal defended the middle of the field. I don’t care how the NBC broadcasters said he was having a poor game. He didn’t shoot well, but he really was involved in all of our chances in the 1st half. 

**Rose** – YES. Look at how much width he gave us. I really haven’t fancied him over Davies for the entire season but it just seems like this competition with Davies ACTUALLY made him better. He’s so much more energetic. All I could think of is that he is not a 73 overall rated on Fifa. He’s playing like a 78 or 80 LB ;) 

**Dier** – I can’t remember which game I said it in, but Dier has had another good game. The reason why I’m saying this is because he did nothing wrong. What is he, 20 years old? Huge game, must have nerves, but proved that with **Vertonghen** (constant good performances this year) that they really can hold the back line 

**Walker** – freaking loved his pace as he got past Ozil like nobody was there. 

**Kane** – my man crush for you grows closer to mine for **Eriksen** every time you score. Please never stop. And please never stop showing how much you’re one of our own &lt;3. I don't think **Eriksen** did poorly, Arsenal's game was to take him out of the match 

**Bentaleb and Mason** – I seriously don’t get how composed and mature this pairing of a 20 and 24 year old were. I can’t believe I’ve missed this paring so much, especially with $20 pairing of say Paulinho and Capoue waiting in the back. Thank you Sherwood, for having a profound love for Bentaleb when I questioned you most 

**Lloris** – you’re a keeper. Forever and forever

Edit 1: Not too much so far, Lennon starting to link up with Coleman a bit more. Everton's play style currently is long balls to Lukaku. Lennon made one run into the box. Not a lot of counter-attacking from Everton to allow Lennon to use his pace. 

Edit 2: Speculative shot from Lennon from outside the area goes wide after an Everton corner. Offside was already called. Not too much as of yet, Everton still playing through Lukaku. Game heating up now, small kerfuffle on the pitch between Henderson and Naismith

Edit 3: Lennon with excellent pressure on Sakho wins the ball back for Everton in the final third, the break results in a cross from Lennon being cleared by Skrtel. Good play from Lennon. 80th Minute.

Edit 4: 90th Minute, Barkley finds a good ball to Lennon but there was too much pace on it, Lennon just gets there and fires a cross across the goal but as he was stretched the ball just goes into the hands on Mignolet. 

FT: 0-0. Not much to speak of from Lennon, didn't look bad, Everton didn't have many opportunities breaking forward to show his qualities.

null,false,PubliusPontifex,null,null,null,"Very good response. Regarding history, yes human discourse has been similar over the centuries, but in each of those eras, the awareness of those limitations has been restricted, hence the near revolutionary views of Voltaire and later Marx (""Hegel remarks somewhere that all facts and personages of great importance in world history occur, as it were, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as a tragedy, the second time as farce."", in that our later awareness gives us obvious hindsight to the constraints of the dialectic in the past, but never the present).

&gt;But Curtis doesn't tell us what the point is, much like a poem in English class, we have to interpret the story ourselves. And to my mind, that makes it more of an art project than an actual documentary. 

No, he's asking you to think about it for yourself. The dialectic is a prison, one that forces us to think in 'us vs them' terms. The only way out of the dialectic is awareness of its nature, that is his solution. Be mindful of the ways your thoughts feed back into the 'terrorism bad, ugh!' pattern.

You're asking him to give you a second dialectic (curtis'ian thought vs. modern society) to free yourself from the first, it never works that way, that's like trying to quit drinking by taking up heroin.

His whole documentary, his thesis, and his call to action are 'gnōthi seafton', or 'know thyself', and his ultimate blame falls to our lack of self-awareness and tendency to follow social and psychological influences without forethought. Sounds like a decent call to action to me, and a hell of an ambitious objective.

Obviously that includes all forms of pay-outs - pensions, JSA, education costs etc. I think compulsory education costs around £70,000 per child - it will take the average earner over 20 years just to pay that off.

The interesting thing was that so many people called in to tell him how outrageous it was for him to say that they get back £300,000 off the state (despite him repeatedly correcting them that this was the average figure) - people who said they have private health care and send their children to private schools, and how dare he make these claims.


There's obviously an issue in this country with victimisation of the poor and 'dole dossers'. The problem is that people don't realise that we're almost all scroungers - very few of us will ever pay our own way by the time we die.

  On the plus side, Sturridge isn't injured and Ibe impressed. Clean sheet and a point away from home.

  As for the negatives... I think we have to be critical of Rodgers's in game management, Coutinho shouldn't have come off (perhaps he had a knock?) and Lambert felt like a bit of a desperate sub (there again we didn't have much else).

  And on a different note, I'm disappointed with Allen. I really rated him at the start of the season, and being Welsh I'd love to see him do well, but I just don't see what he offers to the team. He was pretty much a bystander today. He didn't play a single imaginative pass, and he's not strong enough to play as a holding midfielder. It was upsetting to watch him get bullied off the ball time and time again.

A levels are not teaching me their content. A levels are teaching me their exams. 

Quick example: I have been writing coursework for my AS English Literature course in the past few weeks. Twice I have been told to totally redo it because I 'didn't present this right' or I 'Didn't include enough of this' despite the points that I am making being perfectly totally correct and valid.

Defensive: Good at harrassing players, bad at tracking runs and tackling, very very weak in duels, probably the weakest player in the league. Wins 10% of his aerial duels. 

Offensive: 1 assist I believe since he joined us? He uses way too much time on the ball, OR passing back or sideways, giving the opposition plenty of time to get organised. For comparison, LUCAS passes the ball forward more than twice as often as Allen per 90 minutes. THIS is the biggest problem with playing Allen instead of Lucas, notice how much more compact and organised Everton were after Lucas came of. 

So what is this glue he's so famous for? He's supposed to link the team together, make sure we don't get too big gaps in our team, which is a viable role if the rest of the team is working. But when the rest of the team is struggling he has to contribute with something else than being ""glue"". We need forward passes to link the defense with the attack, we need tackles, we need him to win back balls, we need him to do SOMETHING more specific than being glue.

FIRST- I didn't brine or marinate the quail this time, I just removed it from the packaging, heavily salted them, put them in a pyrex bowl and left them over night.

[STUFFING] (http://i.imgur.com/z46X0jy.jpg)- The stuffing is one big ass diced apple, two carrots, five cloves of garlic, the juice of half a lemon, maybe a table spoon of brown sugar, and then salt, black pepper, lemon pepper, garlic powder, and a pinch of nutmeg.

[STUFF THEM BIRDS] (http://i.imgur.com/M9XZsp8.jpg)- sprinkle any extra stuffing just all over them suckers. Melt a quarter stick of butter and pour over the birds before they go in the oven (400F or 200C). Butter as opposed to olive oil or other things gets them the most flavorful and crispy skin. Salt and pepper. Put em in the oven for nearly 30 minutes while keeping vigilant watch.

If, for example, Curtis' aim is to make the viewer think and come to their own conclusions, then why the blatantly emotionally manipulative music and archival footage that is specifically designed to elicit a certain emotional response?  Indeed the use of footage of random conflicts, the banks and so on are arguably 'leading the viewer on', subtly reinforcing connections in the mind between things that on paper, sound flimsy and reaching.  I also object to the idea that Curtis doesn't take a clear 'us vs them' narrative.

Scotland has the highest proportion of redheads; 13% of the population has red hair and approximately 40% carries the recessive redhead gene.[11] Ireland has the second highest percentage; as many as 10% of the Irish population has red, auburn, or strawberry blond hair.[12] It is thought that up to 46% of the Irish population carries the recessive redhead gene.[1] A 1956 study of hair color amongst British army recruits also found high levels of red hair in Wales and the English Border counties.[13]

null,false,davidsmichaelangelo,null,null,null,"Mignolet- Had nothing really to do until the fantastic save from Coleman. Collected high balls and balls over the top well, as he has been doing in recent weeks, except the one where Can had to bail him out. 8/10

Can- Looked very confident on the ball, but maybe a little too confident at times. He should really have released a pass sooner on a few occasions and he'll eventually make a mistake leading to a goal if he continues to play like that. I noticed Skrtel was furious at him towards the end for not passing, and instead being intercepted. 7/10

Skrtel- Looked very solid and covered really well when other defenders where out of place. 8.5/10 

Sakho- Wasn't as commanding as he has been recently and didn't win every header (of course, you can't expect a player to win every duel, but I've come to expect it after recent performances). He usually has one or two moments every game where he makes you hold your breath and tonight wasn't an exception with a few loose balls. 6/10

Moreno- Provided support up the left and then turned back when he had the ball. There isn't much point in bombing forward if you don't make the overlapping runs or just try to outpace the defender which I didn't see very often today. He is so fast but he needs to learn to use his pace more productively. Really frustrating! 5/10

Ibe- Really impressed with him. He demonstrated what I've wanted to see all season from Sterling which is just running at the defenders instead of turning back (like Moreno above). Other than the Chelsea goal I can't recall Sterling running past defenders this season like he did so easily last season, but Ibe showed him how it's done. He even got back well to defend when Everton broke away. And that shot!! I think he could become as good as Sterling in a year or two. 8.5/10

Coutinho- Everton knew he was the man to mark and he was effectively kept out of the game. Tried a few of his usual defence splitting balls but not much was working for him. Unlucky to take a knock, but I'm sure he'll come back better than before. 6/10

Henderson- Like most of the other players Henderson didn't play today like he has been recently. Average performance, can't think of any stand out moments. 6/10

Allen- Doesn't offer the defensive cover that Lucas does and today didn't show much in the way of attack either. I enjoyed watching Joe play at the end of last season and beginning of this when Rodgers asked him to support the attack when he could as he got into some really good positions, but as a DM he just doesn't seem very able. I still like him a lot and think he is a good enough player for us, but Rodgers needs to fin the best position and role for him. 5.5/10

Gerrard- Everyone was saying he was in this line-up for the sentimentality but you can't blame Rodgers for putting him into the Merseyside Derby. So often he has really stepped it up for this game that even if he's been terrible for a few weeks you can still rely on him to influence this game. This was an exception. Hopefully we can meet Everton in the Europa League and he can have a better ""final derby"". 4.5/10

Sterling- Like Coutinho, just not on it today. As above when talking about Ibe, I just want to see him run at players. It was so exciting to see last season but he doesn't seem to want to try it recently. 6/10

Lambert- OK, this surely **was** a sentimentality gesture by the manager. I don't think he was what we needed at the time and I knew our chance to win the game was gone when he came on. He's a target man and when you go a whole game hitting the first man on the very few crosses you make, you shouldn't bring on a target man. Also, I'm sick of how he gives away freekicks needlessly- he is so often brought on to win the game in the precious final minutes but pushes a player over and wastes thirty seconds (that and almost always being offside, but I don't think he was today). 5/10

Sturridge- Looked lively but found it difficult without Coutinho, and then Sterling providing balls to break through the Everton bus. 6.5/10",null,0,null,1423339408,null,0,false,0,coebm62,null,t3_2v47qd,null,t1_coebm62,null,t3_2v47qd,null,null,null,1424083586,null,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null
