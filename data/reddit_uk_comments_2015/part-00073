&gt; again totally irrelevant. We've had players that played for top teams like Keane, Duff, Given, McGrath, Brady, Whelan, Giles etc.
&gt; Historically before the ROI got involved in the grandparent rule and the post 1998 player stealing NI has always been the stronger team.
&gt; It really hasnt been that way since Jack Charlton took over as ROI manager in 1986.

I just want to point out the break in NI qualifying for anything can be seen as directly related to the troubles. 1990-2000 players are the people who were born in the worst of the troubles when football in NI as a whole took a nose dive at league level which is a big factor in youth development, as well as us generally being a small country.  The increase in quality of NI since then is almost a post troubles bounce. Qualification for tournaments has also been expanded greatetly in recent years making it easier to qualify for the Euro's athlo the break up of Yugoslavia means you could argue a world cup is as hard to qualify for as it's ever been.

The only player there that would make an all Ireland top XI ever is Roy Keane and maybe Robbie Keane. Pat Jennings, Martin O'Niel, Gerry Armstong, George Best, Norman Whiteside, Danny Blancenflower, Elisha Scott, Harry Gregg,  Billy Bingham, Sammy McIlroy, Jimmy McIlroy were all truly word class players as opposed to good.  Admittedly we haven't had a world class player in a while but our recent best of Hughes, Chris Brunt, Mc Nair, Evans and Healy breaking a European goal scoring record is no worse than the best ROI players our problem lies in the squad depth which would be improved in an all Ireland team.

To say your not letting players from other countries play for you is ridiculous. Your only goal at Euro 2014 was a Scot passing to an Englishman who Scored. Your 1990 and 1994 teams were a GB B team select, 1990 only half the squad was from the ROI and Tony Cascarino turned out to have played 80 odd games without even being eligible to play for Ireland..",null,0,null,1424832740,null,0,1424833618,0,cowafrr,null,t3_2wzqd0,null,t1_cowafrr,null,t1_cow7y2c,null,null,null,1427440321,null,-1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,-1,null

null,false,Adahn5,null,null,null,"&gt;Communism will never work because it fails to take into account just how big of a motivating force greed is.

The notion that greed and selfishness are a primary motivating factor that's ingrained in human nature has been debunked by studies performed by the University College of London, M.I.T., the University of Amsterdam, the University of Princeton, the University of Berkley, Washington State University, Emory and Carnegie Mellon[[1]](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/24/grotesque-inequality-greed-human-nature-capitalism)[[2]](http://youtu.be/u6XAPnuFjJc)[[3]](http://public.wsu.edu/%7Etaflinge/biology.html)[[4]](http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/the_compassionate_instinct)[[5]](https://taylorlab.psych.ucla.edu/research/#Tend_and_Befriend). It's an artificial construct, and one that exists as a by-product of our survival instinct. Under our current economic system, as well as its previous two exploitative iterations, money equalled survival. The more you had, the better your chances are.

This is supported by the works of evolutionary biologist [John Maynard Smith](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-evolution-of-behavior/), anthropologist [Robert Trivers](http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/Trivers-EvolutionReciprocalAltruism.pdf), political scientist [Robert Axlerod](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/211/4489/1390) and Primatologist [Frans De Waal](http://www.emory.edu/LIVING_LINKS/empathy/), and economist/zoologist/evolutionary theorist [Peter Kropotkin](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/kropotkin-peter/1902/mutual-aid/). 

All of these go into detail into why human beings are much more cooperative, altruistic, reciprocal, mutualistic and empathetic with one another than they are selfish, greedy or egocentric. None deny that these latter aspects of behaviour exist, but simply hold that they do not account for the concepts of emotional contagion, targetted helping, cultural transmission, consolation, game theory or self-recognition. If you can explain these with 'human nature is selfish and greedy', by all means I'd love to learn how.

Source #2, particularly, which is Dan Pink's seminar on Mastery, Autonomy and Purpose, reveals that once people earn enough money to satisfy their basic needs they become motivated by having a sense of autonomy (ie. the desire to be self-directed), mastery (ie. the urge to get better at things), and purpose in their work and life. Money is simply a means to those basic needs, and if you were to eliminate it altogether, and provide those means to the people another way, or for those means to be guaranteed/readily and freely available to them, people would no longer engage in the kind of behaviour you call ""greed"".

&gt;The need for food, water or shelter is biological -- a lack results in death. However, human society has changed how and why resources are gathered. The biological necessity is the same: humans need to eat, drink, sleep, stay out of the rain. But society has developed a way to transport current resources into the future for use in that future -- money.

My wife (nor son) had seen Classic Who. I had fond memories of John Pertwee and Tom Baker. I remember seeing Eccleston and being astonished how much he reminded me of a younger, tougher Tom Baker. But once I saw him, I knew he was doing an excellent job of being the Doctor.

My wife and son both like him ... so much that when I learned he was going to regenerate, I had to explain it to my wife and tried to calm her down (she initially hated David Tennant, and it was until he had a couple of episodes that she decided to give Tennant a try; she ultimately really enjoyed Tennant as the Doctor).

And while it sounds like I'm tossing a lot on Eccleston's shoulders, let me say that this story took a lot of nerve.

Ask anybody about Doctor Who and they would say, if you're going to introduce people to Doctor Who, do a Dalek story.

This story featured the autons, which honestly could have come off as campy. Yes, it tied the new series to the old. But man, it had the potential to be awful, and yet the story worked. It worked well.

Rose gets introduced and she's shown to be capable (she rescues the Doctor), so she's not just following him around and simply being ""a mirror for us to see the Doctor through"". She was a capable companion, worthy of traveling with the Doctor.

As for the humor, it was a bit much, but it reminded me of episodes with Tom Baker; rewatch City of Death and see Tom Baker and John Cleese; here he is making a subtle jab at art critics:

It's not vague, it's variable based on production levels and the price for brent crude futures.

Production levels are actually pretty easy to forecast at well, facility and even company level (source: I led a production planning team about 10 years ago). They are nowhere near as volatile as the oil price.  

&gt; I never said that it was based upon oil I said that it was reliant upon oil, just as it's also reliant upon financial services and whisky. That is fact.

So it is also reliant on every other industry in the country; the only ones making a fuss about the oil were the unionists.

Largely no, but so what? That's besides the point. You can't just ignore a the vulnerabilities of a significant portion of your economy and pretend that it's not important. It is.

As far as the ring, I like the idea of the Gallifreyan script, although putting some kind of hidden message in it might be difficult. I mean, there's really a realistic limit to the number of characters you can squeeze on an engagement ring. Personal opinion, but depending on how much you want to go Doctor Who with this, you could make a companion piece to go with the ring: A TARDIS ring box. The materials could be whatever you want, depending on how long you plan to keep the box. Not a fan of DIY? Use a papercraft TARDIS. Have some skills working with wood and/or miniature modeling? Make a small, wooden ring box and paint it to look like the TARDIS.

It's easy to just say ""Increase the capacity of the stand"",  but over the two years of construction, you only have two 3 month periods where the stadium isn't in use. So the stand had to be designed so it could be built while the original stand both remains in place *and* is accessible for all of the fans.

The video shows how brilliantly they've overcome the challenge by having the structure of the new stand form and arc over the old entryway with the new seats built on top of the old roof.

It's also an odd change of heart from Emma Barnett after her article in January ([British girls join Islamic State and we dismiss them as âjihadi bridesâ
](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11360581/Islamic-State-British-girls-join.-We-dismiss-them-as-jihadi-brides.html)), in which she described them as ""_vulnerable British teen girls_"".

Barnett said in her January article:

&gt; research also shows that it is well-educated and well-informed girls who are drawn to this life. 

&gt; ... usually young, bright, second or third generation British, Muslim and terribly disillusioned. 

&gt; ,,, we have overlooked these vulnerable British girls for too long, writing them off while we focus on their 
 ostensibly more violent brothers.

&gt; ... it's up to us ... to somehow make these educated but ignored girls feel valued in our society.

Now it's:

&gt; these teen girls arenât stupid. Far from it. In fact they are all grade-A students at the Bethnal Green Academy in Tower Hamlets. We are told by their worried friends and family that they are thoughtful and intelligent people.

&gt;  So donât dole out sympathy to them just because of their gender. Instead, serve them up an equal helping of that anger which society seems to reserve solely for men who do wrong.

&gt;

&gt;___Lays of Ancient Rome___ is a collection of [narrative poems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_poetry), or lays, by [Thomas Babington Macaulay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Babington_Macaulay,_1st_Baron_Macaulay). Four of these recount heroic episodes from early [Roman history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Rome) with strong [dramatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama) and [tragic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy) themes, giving the collection its name. Macaulay also included two poems inspired by recent history: *Ivry* (1824) and *The Armada* (1832).

No offense but the reason you want MPs to have a background in their appointed ministry is because don't understand what it is ministers actually do. A minister for education has an entire building of people who ARE expert in teaching. HIS responsibility is to communicate to them the government's strategy for the state of education in the country and then manage them as they carry it out. 

Your post is akin to saying a general in the army is unsuited to his role because he's not a crack shot or cannot disarm a bomb.

And yes, high grades are everything. The skill you want in your elected representative is the ability to quickly and accurately grasp the principles behind a huge range of issues and the nous to identify the most effective person or action needed to deal with it. How many politicians do you think are conversant with the minutiae of water treatment, religious fundamentalism, urban planning, healthcare, immigration, youth gangs...

It would be the same number of houses and same number of families in both cases.

Landlords don't just leave a property empty for any significant amount of time.  That would be completely pointless.  Go on to a landlord subreddit (there are several) and ask them whether they'd just leave a property empty.

More seriously for a moment. Brian Cox is a famous member of an institution famous for its astrophysics research and education. Contrary to this quote Cox is at least aware that the earth is not the centre of the universe. The charts astrologers use depict a geocentric universe and are actually off by 20^o or so.

(No extra payment will be made for any additional hours worked, unless expressly authorised by your line manager.) The Company reserves the right at its discretion to vary overtime rates.*

**They have the right to demand overtime from you, but payment for this is only at the discretion of management.**

*The Company reserves the right to require you to work different hours of work according to the needs of the business, whether on a temporary or a permanent basis. This may involve shorter or longer hours of work, or working on different days of the week or at different time of the day in accordance with operational requirements. It is a condition of your employment that you agree to work different hours if requested to do so by the company.*

**To me this looks like they are asking for the right to be able to reduce or increase your hours whenever they want and entirely at their discretion. If your contract specifies a fixed amount of hours (say 35 or 40) then you *should* be OK but if it doesn't, or you're on a zero-hours one then you will be a lot worse off than now.**

*Your normal working hours are... These hours will be your normal of work unless otherwise agreed between you and the Company.*

**At present, you might work from X:XX - Y:YY but they want to right to change this** ***if you are both in agreement***.

*The Company reserves the right to lay you off or put you on short time working....*

**Again, the significance of this will depend on how many hours you are currently contracted for. If you're zero hours, then you're worse off than now.**

*The Company will be joining the Auto Enrolment Pension Scheme on 1 April 2017. Details of the company and your obligations will be sent out to all employees who meet the criteria well in advance of this date.*

**Larger companies had to join at earlier dates, I believe this is the last possible date for a smaller company to begin.**

*The company may require you to undergo a medical examination by a medical practitioner nominated at any stage of your employment... The company will only request such an examination where reasonable to do so.*

*There may also be occasions where the Company considers it necessary to request a medical report on your health from your GP or consultant.... you will be asked to give your written consent...*

**Medical examinations of this sort are typical in jobs such as lorry or train driver as it allows the employer to perform drug/alcohol testing.** 

**It looks to me like they want the right to do that, but also request information from your GP if they want. Is there a big problem with sickness absences at your place? That might explain this.**

*[The disciplinary procedure is] entirely non-contractual and does not form part of an employees contract of employment.*

**A contract can only be changed with the agreement of BOTH parties, so it is common for employers to state that policies regarding sickness/absence etc. are OUTSIDE the contract so that they can be quickly amended. To me, this looks as the reason for this. They want a disciplinary policy, but they don't want the hassle of having to agree a new employment contract every time they wish to make a change.**

6 April 2012 is the date that new rules regarding employee protections were introduced that made it much easier to dismiss staff in their first two years of employment.

I really love, *love* how you've just dropped that comment and used as your evidence a speech where the use of just that word aroused controversy *within* the civil rights movement because most people manifestly did not feel that it was appropriate any longer (as neatly exemplified by the attitude towards the term shown by people such as Malcom X (who elected to pepper HIS speeches with the pointed term ""the so-called Negro"") in that same year). Negro had already started to be supplanted by ""black"" in the years before that speech and ""I Have a Dream"" actually hastened it's fading as a ""polite"" term.

But that's by the by, since you're citing a dude from the American south and we're talking about a woman who grew up in England. And in England in the 60s, it was not polite to call black people negroes.

So basically, if YOU actually knew what you were talking about, you would've appreciated the irony in citing that speech. But you don't, so you didn't.

* Helmets are only rated to impacts with energy equivalent of a cyclist colliding with a stationary object at a speed of 12mph. The problem here is that most cyclists will be doing more than that, especially if they are cycling alongside motor traffic. Bicycle helmets are wholly inadequate, especially in a collision with a motor vehicle.

* High vis only works in daylight. It works by reflecting UV light back as visible light, which is why it appears brighter. There is no UV light at night.

* Reflective materials only work when the viewer is directly behind the light source. Reflective materials are great at night, especially when cycling in traffic, but if you're walking without any light source beyond street lighting you're not going to see the reflective surfaces any more than anything else.

Do what you want to be seen and protected by all means, but helmets and high vis aren't the answer to all our safety concerns. Plus, when I get on a bike, I don't want to be having to don extra gear.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negro#In_English

&gt; The word ""Negro"" fell out of favor by the early 1970s in the United States.. However, older African Americans from the earlier period of American life (when ""Negro"" was widely considered to be acceptable) initially found the term ""black"" more offensive than ""Negro.""... The U.S. Census now uses the grouping ""Black, African-American, or Negro."" The term ""Negro"" is used in efforts to include older African Americans who more closely associate with the term

So.. it was polite, it remained polite in some quarters of the USA until the 1970s, some black people resisted its replacement, and some older black people *still do*. By the logic you're using, should we be attacking the elderly black Americans who used the ""negro"" option on the 2010 census there? Some people did just that. I don't see what that gained, apart from confusing and possibly hurting some old black people.

You are of course correct that I spoke about the USA; the usage of the word isn't as well documented in the UK, but we tend to be a few years behind in their changes (see the use of the word ""nigger"" for a good example of that - we were decades behind - maybe a century). 

Many people from rural areas with low ethnic diversity didn't get the updates to the language. Why would they? My aunt used the word ""negress"" in the 90s when I got my first back girlfriend, until I told her about its changed usage. She was quite mortified about how she may have been misunderstood.

Today, you can go to parts of the UK and hear ""paki"" and ""chinky"" used in much the same way, as part of everyday speech without any hint of conscious racism on the part of the speaker. ""Fancy a chinky?"" I was often asked when I lived in a former pit village in Co Durham in the early 2000s. The people were shocked to learn that ""down London"", the word was massively offensive. My mother still refers to the ""local paki shop"" in her corner of Scotland, despite my repeated attempts to convince her not to. She says that that's what the owner calls it himself, and if he's happy with it, then so is she. I finally got her to agree to not use it in England.

Language is not static, nor is it uniform. Different people mean different things by the same words. Change is slow, sometimes glacial, and sometimes doesn't occur at all. The word ""negro"" is still used by some older people in the UK, who still believe it it is the polite term, because that's what they were brought up to say (when ""nigger"" became offensive here - much later than in the USA). Some other people got the later nuances and use ""coloured"" - I had another relative in that age range. She used it when speaking to another black girlfriend of mine (who was American, who heard MLK speak in person, and who remembers desegregation very well, since she was in the middle of it). The girlfriend just shrugged and said: ""she's old. That's the word they use."" That relative was, in fact, racist, and quite a good parallel to the UKIP woman. My ex wasn't offended by the word ""coloured"", she was offended by the aunt's views on interracial relationships - *which was the real issue*.

I'm afraid that that's simply the way it is: once in a while you will find people using the outdated words; especially old people, and people who live in rural areas with little diversity.

You are of course free to get angry with them over that, and shout and rant to your heart's content. But if they mean the word politley, all you will do is confuse them. I think it's much better to tackle *actual* prejudice, such as the other things the UKIP woman said, rather than focus on the semantics.

Clearly, you disagree, and that's your right. I'll keep putting my efforts into fighting actual racism, and you can focus on getting everyone in the UK up to speed using the same words for everything.

That's the key figure here. It's not a *small* minority. That's a large chunk of people. Given there are roughly 3m~ Muslims in the UK, that's over 800,000 people who sympathise with the murder of journalists.

Also from the figures, 24% of people responding disagreed that violence is never justifiable against people who publish images of the prophet.

So essentially, at least 24% of Muslims believe violence IS justifiable. And 27% of them sympathise with the murderers motives.

And another great stat here, 45% disagree that clerics who promote violence are out of touch with mainstream muslim opinion.

I'm sure this study will get filed away as just more anti-muslim propaganda by people who are unwilling to believe that 99% of muslims are nothing but peace loving normal people who love this country.

And just to clarify, I get that it's still a minority. I am not prejudiced towards all muslims, I just don't think we can brush this problem under the carpet as a ""tiny minority of muslims"" which has been the default line parroted out since the dawn of multiculturalism.

I don't know what the solution is but I do think it has to come from within the Muslim community.

If you think that changes my argument you literally do not understand the discussion we are having. 

And a British citizen only has to provide evidence that another state has agree to accept them as a national. There are plenty of states that don't allow dual nationality. It isn't hard to do. And once they've renounced their British citizenship all they need to do is not follow up on their other option. It's both legal, possible and relatively straightforward to accomplish.

This is not clear at all and suggesting it is reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the symbiotic role between the two.

This is the key issue - conditions are stacked against the worker so that the government can withold pension funds.

Regarding water rescue, many authorities have written SOPs prohibiting firefighters from entering the water.  I would suggest that this has been done so that they can avoid investing time and money in training or equipment.  This seems short sighted as it's likely that they will have to deal with increasing instances of flooding.  Most firefighters would prefer to be empowered to respond to water rescue incidents, but at the moment doing so currently will only lead to disciplinary action where training and resources have not been provided.  Incidently, can you point me to the instance you mantioned involving the refusal to rescue from shallow water?  I'd be interested to read about it.

It should be easy to make money and get harder the more you have, that way those that work hard and work smart make more money than everyone else fairly and without screwing everyone over. You can't 'create wealth' from nowhere. You need people to buy your goods, you need a big powerful middle/working class (just look at post WWII America). It ensures people have money to actually buy the goods otherwise you can create whatever the hell you want but poor people won't buy them.

Production increases and net GDP increases with innovation for that we need more people working on ideas. For that we need more people with more start up capital. Currently we have millions of people with millions of ideas rotting away because they don't have the upfront capital.

You are very right that we have to be careful not to scare off companies we want to encourage growth not spread it to other countries. A race to the bottom helps no-one though. The markets are not the best way of allocating resources that is why we have so many caps and limits, laws and restrictions to prevent the markets inevitable slide toward monopoly. The market is a good system once it has enough government planning. 

Human greed trumps the will of the nation which is what you literally just said with companies moving away, so it makes no sense that the best economy would be based on the same motives. A completely free market allows for lies, propaganda, monopolies, buying out and supressing innovation (the exact opposite of a strong economy), smear campaigns and for one company to eventually produce everything. When that happens the quality can slide as much as they like and there is nothing you can do about it.

&gt;That's the key figure here. It's not a minority. That's a large chunk of people. Given there are roughly 3m~ Muslims in the UK, that's over 800,000 people who sympathise with the murder of journalists.

As you say later on, it *is* a minority. It's less than 50%, that's the definition of minority.


&gt;Also from the figures, 24% of people responding disagreed that violence is never justifiable against people who publish images of the prophet.


&gt;So essentially, at least 24% of Muslims believe violence IS justifiable. And 27% of them sympathise with the murderers motives.

I'm willing to bet that a lot of people believe violence can be justified (it wouldn't be hard for us to concoct a situation where people would agree that violence is justified, which would disprove that it can never be done). The problem here isn't that it can be justified, but that the violence is enacted against those who publish images of the Prophet. 

I'll give an example. ""Acts of violence against child abusers can be justified."" Do you honestly think most people would disagree with that statement? My point is, the justification bit needs the context of motive.


&gt;And another great stat here, 45% disagree that clerics who promote violence are out of touch with mainstream muslim opinion.

This is the particularly worrying one to me, because it is approaching a majority. Only 49% agreed that such clerics were out of touch.


&gt;I'm sure this study will get filed away as just more anti-muslim propaganda by people who are unwilling to believe that 99% of muslims are nothing but peace loving normal people who love this country.

Honestly I'm surprised by reddit's reaction to this. By and large, it's positive (more liberal and Westernised views are held by the majority of Muslims after all). There's still work to do to reduce those numbers further, and I don't doubt that the proportion of Muslims sympathising with people fighting for IS and Al-Qaeda (11%) is higher than in any other demographic, for example.

I managed to convince her to keep the lawyers out of it as there is only a limited amount of money in any marriage and once they get involved we both loose and loose a whole shed load of money. so we went online and go a fixed price divorce.

She got the house and the family people carrier on the proviso that she kept off my company. if she went after a share of that i would have to put people out of work and some of these people i've known for over 10 years, i know them and their families it wouldn't be fair for them to suffer because of it. Especially as could not even drive to my work she knew little or anything about it and was not even interested in what i do so why should she have a share of it ? I looked online at the typical wage split in a divorce and after ALOT of arguing we agreed a childcare/maintenance figure, i fixed this against the RPI so it goes up or down against that to save revisiting it in the future.

I was prepared to go 70/30 to keep my kids local to me and close to their friends and at the same school and in the home they were used to. Just because we were splitting up there was no need for them to feel in anyway unwanted or used as pawn in our falling out. Also to stop her harming my company, i tried to keep objective about the whole thing because the mechanics of the actual affair/s still make me furious to this day.

Luckily the kids have come through it unscathed and don't really remember much about that time and are happy and enjoy spending time with both of us.

hope that explains it a bit... it was 6 years ago now and i've blanked most of that time out of memory now :/

Failing that I would've thought you should be able to sort it out directly with HMRC.

Remember this news report ?

&gt; *Last night, Mr Farage told Channel 4 News: ""There is a very strong argument that says that what happened in Paris is a result - and we've seen it in London too - is a result I'm afraid of now having a fifth column living within these countries.
""We've got people living in these countries, holding our passports, who hate us.
""Luckily their numbers are very, very small but it does make one question the whole really gross attempt at encouraged division within society that we have had in the past few decades in the name of multiculturalism.""*

Farage was heavily criticised.

&gt;Theresa May, the Home Secretary, condemned the comments. ""It is irresponsible to talk about a fifth column"", she said.

&gt;Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said he was ""dismayed"" by the comments : âTo imply that British Muslims, who I know are fervently British yet also proud of their Muslim faith, are somehow part of the problem not part of the solution is grabbing the wrong end of the stick.â

When challenged on the validity of this plan, she foundered. Perhaps because the plan is patently ludicrous.

We do need affordable homes for rent in this country, but promising the earth with fantasy figures is no more useful than doing nothing at all. Populist policies are only worth anything if the parties that make them are able to back them up with action.

This is a second leg with us up a goal.  They won't panic and throw everything at Liverpool but we should cede possession and plan to hit them on the counter.  Moreno, Sterling and Ibe should be more than enough speed. Moreno has been close to breaking the offside trap for a while, I think he can beat this back line.  

Ibe I want to concentrate on going forward, Manquillo to be a little more defensive.  Might even see Glen Johnson play there (unfortunately).  I think between Ibe and Sterling they can do real damage, Lallana will find acres of space to pull the strings and set them up while pressing.  

Allen and Henderson have to play but wouldn't be surprised to see Can move to the midfield with Kolo going on as a sub.  Sahko needs to be 100% for City.  Might even see Balotelli come on and Sterling pushed to Lallana's spot who moves to replace Henderson or Allen.

Interestingly enough, #1 is France....check the wiki:

&gt;Even if the French have the reputation of being one of the thinnest peoples in developed countries,[251][252][253][254][255][256] Franceâlike other rich countriesâfaces an increasing and recent epidemic of obesity, due mostly to the replacement of traditional healthy French cuisine by junk food in French eating habits.[251][252][257] Nevertheless, the French obesity rate is far below that of the USA (for instance, obesity rate in France is the same that the American once was in the 1970s[252]), and is still the lowest of Europe,[254][257] but it is now regarded by the authorities as one of the main public health issues[258] and is fiercely fought; rates of childhood obesity are slowing in France, while continuing to grow in other countries.[259]

Now its estimated we spend 4.2Bn a year on obesity that's disgusting and also would represent a 4% boost to the NHS if people put the pies down.

Thats slightly flawed...

No matter what speed youre traveling when you fall from a bike you still hit the tarmac at more or less the same speed/downward force.

This is is illustrated in motoricycle racing - a motor bike might be traveling at 80+mph but when the rider falls off, but the speed he hits the tarmac at is still around 10-15mph.

Ofcourse once off his bike the biggest danger is the fact he will be sliding across tarmac at 80mph - but that's another problem all together :)

You're missing the word ""some"" there. 27% had *some* sympathy for the motives. As the current top post on the /r/worldnews thread about this points out, the Pope had some sympathy for the motives of the attack. Which isn't to say that he must necessarily be right, but having some sympathy for them isn't the same as saying they were right. It's about understanding them, and seeing where they are coming from. *Having looked at the [poll data](http://comres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/BBC-Today-Programme_British-Muslims-Poll_FINAL-Tables_Feb2015.pdf), when given the statement ""I understand the motives of those who launch attacks in the name of Islam because the religion has been insulted"" 32% agreed - which I find surprisingly low. Personally I understand the motives; I disagree strongly with them, but I understand them. Understanding something is crucial to being able to deal/cope with it.*

The big thing that stands out for me with these kinds of polls is that they have *no control group*. They don't ask non-Muslims, or the UK population in general, how they feel about these things (i.e. asking questions like ""Can violence ever be justified in response to offensive speech/defending your religious values?""). The same goes with the questions about feeling loyalty to Britain, or the need to obey British laws.

All the polling tells us is what those sampled said in response to the questions. It doesn't necessarily tell us how they actually feel, and it doesn't tell us anything at all about whether there are differences in opinion between those who identify as Muslim and those who don't.",null,0,null,1424865211,null,0,1424883372,0,cowlg2q,null,t3_2x3idz,null,t1_cowlg2q,null,t1_cowk88j,null,null,null,1427445578,null,58,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,58,null

You present your view as self-evident but there are a number of ways to logically disagree with this statement. In order to support your assertion you would have to argue the following:

First you would have to define what justice for the victim actually means since that's a very subjective idea. 

Second you'd have to argue that a retributive approach actually results in the most justice for the victim. If we truly were focusing on implementing a system that prioritises justice for the victim surely an argument could be made that restorative justice system would be much more appropriate?

Third you'd have to argue that a rehabilitation focused system actually results in less justice for the victim. 

Lastly and must importantly you'd have to argue that justice for the victim should be prioritised above all other concerns including the quality of our overall society, our economy, the future safety of the public, reducing future crime and many other concerns when designing our legal system.

Obviously I say now that I would never join the Nazis, but maybe if I were a teenager in 1930s Germany, I would have joined the Hitler Youth as well, and become a good little Nazi kid too.

I think the situation is similar to what's happening with these kids. Yeah, you'd expect them to know better, but if they are being indoctrinated from a young age then I think they are to some extent victims of that indoctrination.

That doesn't mean that they are blameless: they can be victims of indoctrination while at the same time be guilty of signing up to a murderous terrorist organisation. They can be ""vulnerable children"" while at the same time be ""evil terrorists"" if they are strapping bombs to themselves and blowing up a cafe in Israel. This isn't a simple issue - very few things are. We tend to try to simplify everything, by saying ""this person is evil"" or ""this person is a victim"", as if they can't be both evil and a victim; as if their victimhood in some way diminishes or undermines their evil acts, or vice versa. We tend to think that victimhood implies diminished responsibility, but as the article says, it doesn't. The truth is, people are complicated, situations are complicated, motivations are complicated, reasons are complicated, and there is no way of reducing this to a simple problem of ""these people are evil"".

If we ignore the fact that they are in some way the victim of indoctrination, and just write them off as evil people, then we miss a potential solution to the problem. We can't really do much about people being evil (some people are always evil), but we can do something about the indoctrination of children.

Windbreaks, such as hedges, would also fall foul of such an interpretation.

That ""unwanted vegetation"" clause was added to allow decoupling production output from payments, and letting farm inefficiently if they wanted to, but still farm. Unfortunately it seems the draconian interpretation has been pushed by EU bodies. 

There are tons of sources if you google CAP and ""unwanted vegetation"" from respectable bodies which are equally critical but informative, I apologize if i don't link directly to them.

About GMOs, no true 'pest-resistant' strains have been developed, instead 'pesticide-resistant' strains are the most marketed. Honestly, 'pest-resistant' strains will never exists, for reasons of human edibility and animal evolution. Best you can hope for is the development of 'yield-increase', 'nitrogen-fixing' and 'vitamin-enriched' strains which can be world changing.

Having said that, I would like to remind that agriculture is an inherently destructive process, which we unfortunately need to survive.

Tasing a 14 year old that is holding a knife and refuses to disarm themselves isn't ""meeting a lack of respect with extreme violence"". Police officers aren't tasing children who have no respect for the law, they're using tasers against children who are actively breaking the law.

They controlled the Radio, what television and movies there were, the news and suppressed any rumour of anything that showed them in a less than perfect manner. All sources of infomation available to the Germans of the era were controlled by the Nazis, along with schools. There was no social media to spread word of the atrocities, until the later years of the war at which point indoctrination had been around for over a decade. 

These girls lived in a time where ISIS's crimes are widely reported, where the news cycle is allowed to (and does, to a massive degree) talk about the acts that ISIS is carrying out.

These girls aren't the people who were indoctrinated by the Nazis, these girls are the people who joined the Nazi Party before its rise to power - The Nazis.

The study says 'some sympathy', but nevertheless I don't think you can jump from sympathy for a motive equalling sympathy for an action, as you appear to do here.

&gt; that's over 800,000 people who sympathise with the murder of journalists.

Surely somebody can sympathise with the motive of a perpetuator and at the same time condemn how the perpetuator responded to that motive? To say if you support the former you have to support the latter is not necessarily true.

I can feel sympathy for the motives of the robber who stole my wallet if I believe that he did so in order to try and escape from a life of poverty, but yet also condemn his actions. I can feel sympathy for the motives of a parent who killed her child's murderer, and also condemn her actions.

In this case, all I think we can say is that 27% of those asked believe to have identified motives behind the Charlie Hebdo killing that they sympathise with. This could be offence at supposed blasphemy or a feeling that Western institutions somehow marginalise Muslims. It could even be, in a similar vein to certain school shooters, a mentally-unstable and lonely man's attempt to replicate the media frenzy of a headline-hitting gunman.

Even if we think sympathising with such motives is petty, ridiculous and even dangerous, we cannot assume that if someone expresses sympathy with a motive they automatically sympathise with the response to that motive, i.e. the shootings.

null,false,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"&gt;Do you have a source for that claim?

I worked as a Youth Worker for a Council and while I don't have the specific law to hand, anyone under the age of 18 is considered vulnerable for many purposes, along with the elderly and people with with mental illnesses or difficulties, disabilities etc.

Being classed as vulnerable means different things in different circumstances, but please note that ""vulnerable"" does not mean ""do not shoot with a taser under any circumstances"". I don't think anyone would suggest that if someone is going to stab you to death that you shouldn't be able to defend yourself because they are 14.

However we hopefully both agree that drawing a taser and pointing it at a child should literally be the last resort. 

&gt;asing a 14 year old that is holding a knife and refuses to disarm themselves isn't ""meeting a lack of respect with extreme violence"". Police officers aren't tasing children who have no respect for the law, they're using tasers against children who are actively breaking the law. These children show by their very actions that they have no respect for the law.

Considering you just asked a guy for a source to prove something that is enshrined in UK law (i.e. that anyone under the age of 18 is considered vulnerable, even more so if they are under 16) yet you've made this comment with literally no sources.

So would you like to provide a source to back that up? There's certainly not been an in depth study to show all these tasers were used on people actively breaking the law *and it was necessary* to point a taser at them.

You could be right, there could genuinely have been at least 400 incidents last year where there was no other option than to draw a taser and point it at a child. In my experience with the police force though this will not be the case. Sure I don't have a source for that, it's anecdotal, but I'm also not trying to say that these uses were justified or not justified based on literally no information, which is what you're doing.

&gt;edit: In addition, I fail to see how a police officer using a taser can be considered ""extreme violence""

You obviously have no idea what it's like to be shot with a taser.

Firsltly, tasers can kill quite easily, especially if you have an underlying medical condition. If the person is waving a knife around, which according to you is the only time they are used, you don't have time to ask them shit like ""Do you have any preexisting heart conditions I should be aware of before I tase you?"".

So inherently, when you point a taser at someone, you decide before pulling the trigger whether it's necessary to do so. You decide that the possibility of *maybe* killing that person, even if it's a small chance, outweighs the danger.

No if you compare that to using your extendable baton to subdue someone by hitting them behind the knees (another police tactic) there is no chance of death there.

If you don't believe me, then look at the met's very own website which refers to tasers as:

&gt;A taser is a **less-lethal** single shot self-defence weapon

Note it's not ""non-lethal"" but ""less-lethal"". By using a taser you are inherently accepting the fact there is a possibility the person you're firing it at may die.

Anyone who has been shot by a taser, must then immediately be examined by a doctor. This is because they have had approximately 9according to the met!) 1,200 volts of electricity pass through their body.

Now compare this to the more traditional options I've already talked about which are hitting someone with a fancy stick and restraining them. There's no doctor's exam unless they got REALLY injured, there's no chance of them dying when being hit except from negligence.

Tasers are very violent and are literally one step below shooting someone with a gun. Unless in every single one of those 400 incidents the kid had a deadly weapon which they were refusing to put down, and the police offers were in immediate danger, I don't think their use is justified or proportional.

Great anecdotal evidence there but still no actual source on the claim that people under 18 are automatically classed as vulnerable *under UK law*.

Your comment is way too long for me to respond to every point (I'm supposed to be working!!) however I will respond to a couple that jump out at me.

&gt; However we hopefully both agree that drawing a taser and pointing it at a child should literally be the last resort.

Absolutely!

&gt; Considering you just asked a guy for a source to prove something that is enshrined in UK law (i.e. that anyone under the age of 18 is considered vulnerable, even more so if they are under 16) yet you've made this comment with literally no sources.

I asked you for a source because you claimed something to be stated in UK law that I do not believe is the case. I'm not using my example in an attempt to say that all use of tasers is warranted, I'm merely making the point that children are not automatically exempt from police procedures and can easily pose an immediate threat to a police officer. I made this statement ""Police officers aren't tasing children who have no respect for the law, they're using tasers against children who are actively breaking the law."" because to my knowledge there has been no reported case where a child has been tasered for showing no respect for the law - yes mistakes are made and people (adult or child) are tased under false suspicions but that isn't the same as tasing somebody solely because they have no respect for the law.

&gt;You obviously have no idea what it's like to be shot with a taser.
Firsltly, tasers can kill quite easily, especially if you have an underlying medical condition. If the person is waving a knife around, which according to you is the only time they are used, you don't have time to ask them shit like ""Do you have any preexisting heart conditions I should be aware of before I tase you?"".

I never said tasers cannot be lethal, but something that can potentially be lethal isn't always considered ""extreme violence"" - the two are in no way mutually exclusive. Yes tasers can be lethal, so can [being shoved to the ground.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Ian_Tomlinson)

Superdrug - Not really sure, but the points expire eventually even if you've used the card in the meantime. Only one on this list where part payment is allowed though.

Tesco - 1 point per Â£1. You get vouchers in the post rather than spending money off the card. Vouchers expire after (I think) two years. Plus coupons for things you buy regularly.

Sainsbury's - 1 point per Â£1.

Costa - 5 points per Â£1. Double and extra points offers by email registration.

Waterstones - 1 point per 33 1/3 pence. Extra points on selected books. Can be used in conjunction with the stamp collection card - get 10 stamps each for spending more than Â£10 and get a free Â£10 gift card.

Matalan - Not sure what this actually does now, I've had mine since the days you had to have one to shop there.

I also collect the stamps from Cafe Nero - collect nine stamps and get a free drink.

I would have a slightly different opinion than /u/q_pop and would say that you have to balance the term of the mortgage to ensure its reasonable for you, rather than take the longest term possible, especially since you are going to be charged for pre-payment. I would actually look at different term lengths to figure out what your monthly payment would be and would decide the term length to ensure that the monthly payment is reasonable (with some additional safety margin, even after interest rates rise).

&gt;

&gt;The __Catalonia national football team__ is the official football team of the Spanish [autonomous community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_communities_of_Spain) of [Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia). It is organised by the [Catalan Football Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Football_Federation). The team has been referred to by various names including __SelecciÃ³ Catalana__, __SelecciÃ³ de Barcelona__ and the __Catalan XI__.

&gt;Catalonia is not affiliated with either [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA) or [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA) and is therefore not allowed to participate in either the [FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup) or the [European Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Football_Championship) because the Spanish region of Catalonia is not a state. Catalan players are full Spanish citizens who are eligible to play for [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team).

&gt;However since 1904, the team has played nearly 200 games against various national, regional and club teams.  Since 1997 they have played international friendly games more regularly. Among the teams they have played are [Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria_national_football_team), [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team) and [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team). Recent friendly games include a 4â2 win over [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team) at [Camp Nou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Nou) in December 2009,  and a 4â0 win over [Honduras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras_national_football_team) in December 2010. Their most recent friendly game was played in [CornellÃ -El Prat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estadi_Cornell%C3%A0-El_Prat) against opponents [Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria_national_football_team) in January 2013. The game finished in a 1-1 draw and concluded Dutch great [Johan Cruyff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cruyff)'s stint as coach of the Catalonia national selection.

Normally solar and wind are nicely smoothed because thy are spread out over multiple areas - so weather changes only affect one part at a time. 

This is different - it's a sudden shutdown of most solar generation over a period of a few minutes. That is an unprecedented event in power grid management,and one for which power grids are not designed for.

Now, contingency plans are in place and have been rehearsed in advance with more gas fired powerstations being booked for reserve power than normal, and hydro power plants being urged to conserve water so they can open the sluice gates in seconds ready for the dip. 

The risk of incident is low, but solar has the problem that it is highly synchronised. This is a big problem in california where the daily on-off cycle is so big and so fast that the only technology capable of responding is diesel and  ultra-fast-start gas turbine which are very inefficient.

The reason I gave you anecdotal evidence is because I'm too supposed to be at work, so I don't have time to try and remember all the stuff I was told from a job I had about 6 years ago, and then dig through online legislation records to find the right laws.

So many people on the internet, if they don't agree with something because *it sounds wrong* rather than personal experience sit back and smugly say ""Source?"" as if it some how changes anything. In my experience it's not usually someone with any experience or specialist subject knowledge saying ""Well that goes against my extensive knowledge/experience, do you have something that proves that I'm wrong?"", it's just ""I don't think that sounds right, so I'm going to ask them to prove it"".

Most people can't be bothered to take their time out to dig through this shit to prove a point they already know to be true to someone who they don't know. They just stop arguing as they can't be bothered, and while you've won the internet argument you don't actually know if you were right or not.

I'm telling you it was what I was trained and I was given specific references at the time I was trained that young people in several ways are considered vulnerable. It's why if a youth worker sleeps with a 17 year old they get arrested, not because the 17 year old is under the age of consent, but because they are classed as vulnerable, and therefore even unintentionally the law considers them to ""trust"" certain people more, like say youth workers. 

Now you can sit back and think you've won because I'm not going to bother providing a source, you can even think I'm making all this up, that's totally your choice. If you're actually interested in the topic, then you can do your own research and I'm 100% confident that I'm right, though I'm happy if you can show me I'm wrong. On the other hand, if you can't be bothered to spend your time researching a topic for an internet discussion with strangers, why do you think they will be bothered to do it for you?

Just food for though.

&gt; I never said tasers cannot be lethal, but something that can potentially be lethal isn't always considered ""extreme violence"" - the two are in no way mutually exclusive. Yes tasers can be lethal, so can being shoved to the ground.

So let's take Ian Tomlinson first. Personally I think it's disgusting the police officer wasn't prosecuted for negligence and it's evidence that the country's justice system is broke when it comes to abuses of police power. Also note he was actually dismissed for gross misconduct, so the police aren't following the correct procedures.

The key difference between that and tasering someone, is that when the police officer violently pushed over ian tomlinson for no reason, the police have admitted this was not procedure. What that means is the police officer did something that his training did not instruct him to do, and someone died. This is a fact of life and you can't stop people doing something they are not trained to do short of mind control.

However, if you assume that all 400 of those incidents had procedure followed to the letter, those police officers are still pointing a potentially lethal ranged weapon at someone in a public space. The guy who shoved ian tomlison over was wrong, he wasn't trained to do that, but shooting someone with a taser or shooting someone can be the right decision at the time due to procedure even if it later turns out that the person was innocent.

By definition, that means you'll take a decision that ALWAYS includes the possibility of the person dying, even if you've followed procedure. There is no police procedure that supports randomly shoving people to the ground where there is a chance they may die. Police restrain procedures are specifically designed to be safe, using a taser is inherently not safe. There is always a small chance that some bizarre set of coincidences happen that you couldn't possibly expect, but literally every time you fire the taser there is a chance the person you taser may die. That sounds pretty extreme to me.

Finally, shoving someone to the ground hard enough to injure them when they've done nothing wrong is *disproportional* violence which is what using a taser is unless it's literally your only option as you're in real physical danger.",null,0,null,1424870957,null,0,1424871160,0,cown2az,null,t3_2x39lc,null,t1_cown2az,null,t1_cowmjbm,null,null,null,1427446403,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

I am saying that there is a bell curve of size and strength across races and gender and that these are dependent upon many more factors than the person's genetic background.

There will be ""Asian"" women who are stronger than certain ""White"" men.

When sex offenders prey on teenagers (and lets remember that one of them is 16 and two 15) they are usually selling them a story about how in love with the person they are, in the case of Rotherham they also preyed on lower income girls, impressing them with cars, money, clothing and the like. But at no point is the predator associating himself with other predators who have killed/raped/statutorily raped girls, or making light of the fact that he knows what he's doing is bad. In fact the opposite is likely true, and he is trying to make it seem like what he's doing is justified, which in the case of one of these girls, it would have been if we're to focus on age of consent.

On the other hand you have a recruiter for IS. This person most likely cant use the same techniques regarding showing off with money, as they are in a different country, which is war torn. The country is regularly on the news, and in papers as being an absolute hell hole right now, human rights atrocities are regularly reported on and even bragged about by the perpetrators on social media. There hasn't been anything hidden about this, everyone in the UK knows what IS is, they know what they've done, they know the state of these countries. These girls will have known too, to say they didn't is to shut ones eyes and close ones ears.

Making the decision to go and stay with a predator is one thing, I can entirely understand how a teenager can be convinced that what he or she is doing is okay because they're ""virtually an adult"" and should be able to make their own decisions regarding sex. 

Intentionally going to a war torn country to be the wife of a fighter for a group that brag about burning people alive, is not the same. Its actively supporting the actions of that person.

(emphasis mine)

This is one factor of zero-hours contracts that I'm most interested in - the jobs where employees work on a full-time for a set amount of hours per week, but can nonetheless be without work for weeks or months at a time based on work volumes or seasonal factors. In my experience many of these contracts were previously handled as fixed-term rolling contracts of 3 or 6 months, or were otherwise rigidly defined as ""seasonal"".

Using zero-hours contracts in this way gives total flexibility to the *employer*, but gives almost none to the employee. They're favoured by employers whose work volumes fluctuate unpredictably - for example, if a project ends a week earlier than planned they can just tell their ZH contract staff not to come in for that week, rather than having them sitting around being paid for doing nothing until the end date of their fixed-term contract.",null,0,null,1424871574,null,0,false,0,cown9ua,null,t3_2x3o39,null,t1_cown9ua,null,t3_2x3o39,null,null,null,1427446501,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

null,false,LtSlow,cnty-england,England,null,"&gt;There will be ""Asian"" women who are stronger than certain ""White"" men.

Oh wow, you realized that averages mean ""average"" and not ""every single case"" well done.

&gt;With all of that, I would rather have a properly trained female Asian with a brain than a big white idiot with no training.

Oh look, another straw man. Every policeman goes through the exact same training. Any training the Asian female would have, anybody else would have it too.

The average ""Asian"" (as in Iraqi/Bangladesh/Pakistan male) is around 5'5 and the average ""white"" (European) height is 5'10

The average man is also about 5 inches taller than his female counterpart. Taller people, on average (Since I think I need to clarify this with you, this does not mean *every* case, just *most* cases) are stronger, especially if they had the same training

So, we swap things up so only the biggest, strongest people become front line police. Guess what, due to the largest group of the population that is both strong and big being white males, they become over represented to their % in society.

So, to the original point ""We need more strong, tall front line police officers"" this would obviously be skewed to white and males. There is already a ""problem"" with too many white males in the police (I have no problem, but clearly certain groups did) so if we enacted ""strong, tall people"" only on front lines, this problem would get worse

If you're a 15 year old girl living in a 1st world country, surrounded by social media talking about how ISIS burn people alive and throw them out of top floor buildings, surrounded by stories of young children being raped by the fighters, surrounded by the internet telling you that Syria is utterly war torn, surrounded by newspapers showing pictures of these areas, and reporting on civilian casualties, and regular executions at the hands of a group that dont hide the fact that they are utter religious fanatics, and you still join them, fair play to you.

But in my opinion you should be left out there to rot. If you have the nouse to save up cash to get there, you also have the nouse to assess the risks, accepting these girls back is in my opinion too much of a risk, if theyve been so easily radicalised as you say, then how can we honestly trust them to come back here and be normal?

This isnt driving mums car to the shops, its not graffiti, its not taking drugs, its not even getting involved with gangs and carrying knives for older members, its not sleeping with an older guy.

It's actively saving up money, to go and join people who want to murder everyone around you in utterly savage ways because they support a different religion.

The Brent field, for example, was developed extremely aggressively with water injection wells drilled early in it's lifetime, in an attempt to maximise flow rates.  This basically ensured a very rapid peak and steep decline, in contrast to fields which are more conservatively managed which have tended to show slower decline rates.  It also made it difficult to do a secondary recovery operation, which arguably would have led to a higher overall EUR.  Striving to produce as much as you can will also serve to lower prices, leading to poverty through plenty, a lesson which the current shale boys seem not to have learned.

It's not only OPEC who've acted as a price control cartel.  In the 1950's and 60's the texas railroad comission explicitly limited output to avoid exactly the kind of price crash we're seeing at the moment, and that had happened before.  It's no accident that the periods with most stable oil prices, and the greatest prosperity, coincided with effective cartel control of pricing (standard oil company, texas railroad era, OPEC domination until around 2005).  Each era came to an end when the cartels could no longer control price by limiting production, as they were all pumping flat out.

null,false,TheMagicTorch,null,null,null,"&gt; So many people on the internet, if they don't agree with something because it sounds wrong rather than personal experience sit back and smugly say ""Source?"" as if it some how changes anything.

No, here, as in real life, I'm asking for a source because I would like to see the source of the information. I will then consider this when forming my opinion on subjects. You sound like a religious person who says they shouldn't have to provide ""proof"" that God exists. You can't just expect logical people to believe you without factual evidence and when they do ask for evidence just dismiss them as if they're being unreasonable.

&gt; In my experience it's not usually someone with any experience or specialist subject knowledge saying ""Well that goes against my extensive knowledge/experience, do you have something that proves that I'm wrong?"",

So because I have never overseen the creation of UK legislation (nor have you by the sounds of it) I don't have the right to question ""facts"" about UK law? Are you for real?

&gt; They just stop arguing as they can't be bothered, and while you've won the internet argument you don't actually know if you were right or not.

I'm not aiming to ""win"" anything. I like to debate issues like this with people, especially people who I think oppose my own views - it opens my eyes to other viewpoints and I hope in some cases does the same for the other party. Sometimes I think ending the debate early is the best way to avoid it devolving into some petty argument that is drifting far from the original subject.

&gt;I'm telling you it was what I was trained and I was given specific references at the time I was trained that young people in several ways are considered vulnerable. It's why if a youth worker sleeps with a 17 year old they get arrested, not because the 17 year old is under the age of consent, but because they are classed as vulnerable, and therefore even unintentionally the law considers them to ""trust"" certain people more, like say youth workers.

I don't doubt you were trained, I'm not doubting that whatsoever and I don't believe you have any reason to lie. But ""I was trained that young people in several ways are considered vulnerable"" isn't the same as ""I was trained that under 18's are considered vulnerable by default under UK law"". And your example of a youth worker sleeping with a 17-year old isn't anything to do with vulnerability, it's a matter of duty of care. 

If you are an adult with a âduty of careâ for a young person under 18 (for example a teacher, youth worker or social worker), it is illegal to have sex with anyone who comes under your care, even if they are 16 or 17. - [Source1](http://www.galop.org.uk/consenting-to-sex/questions-about-consent-and-relationships/) [Source2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care_in_English_law)",null,0,null,1424872815,null,0,1424874255,0,cownqwa,null,t3_2x39lc,null,t1_cownqwa,null,t1_cown2az,null,null,null,1427446722,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The fact that Nazi propaganda was far more widespread and all-encompassing just explains why it convinced tens of millions of Germans, but ISIS has only managed to sign up a tiny fraction of Brits.

That being said, the last line you posted is quite plausible. I don't doubt that there are a number of people who are actually just evil or disturbed people, and that's the long and the short of why they've joined ISIS.

The problem is HIV and gay men is so stigmatised, people don't get tested out of fear of being judged or embarrassment, prefer to push it to the back of the mind and say ""I'll do it tomorrow"" forever. I also shy away from clinics and lose motivation because of depression so I rely heavily on [free THT home testing kits](http://www.tht.org.uk) to stay vigilant with my sexual health 

Maybe part of problem is also because gay men don't actually know *how* to take better care a lot of the time?

The only reason I know *why* I'm more at risk and how to protect myself is through my own research. 

It's not like once during school or during these articles and comments anyone ever actually expands on *why* gay men are more at risk. It's always just ""gay men are more at risk"" but never ""here's why"" or ""gay women are least at risk and here's why"". 

It's just a bunch of ""BE AFRAID!!!"" with no education on why anal is more risky to begin with. If they don't know how and why they are more at risk how can they prevent it better? If we don't tell gay men WHY they're more at risk of course there will still be problems. Section 28 etc? 

Also some people just don't care. People with mental illness who don't care if they live or die, doing drugs and going to sex parties, don't care about condoms because they don't care about their health in any context because they actually wouldn't mind dying. Taking the unique mental health and self esteem issues of gay men more seriously instead of pretending we live in some post-homophobia utopia saying ""stop whining"" will cut down on HIV 

A lot of cases someone will be young and have no education or knowledge about how and why they're more at risk, they'll get drunk or take drugs on a night out and take risks, but unlike young heterosexuals who take risks one night and end up with a baby they end up with HIV

This is the kind of things companies can and do with data like that , and i know they do because I work with companies that do it for a living. Any job that involves 'Big Data' is basically connecting things like this together for their profit. There are whole software ecosystems designed to process data like this and hook it together. 


or say if you use free wifi you are giving companies what model device you use. That in turn lets them estimate your income level , spot when you return and how often. They'll print a discount code or survey with reward on your receipt to claim online and voila, they just hooked up your purchase a device you own, and they generate a 'fingerprint' of it. Combine that to their website and they know who is visiting and what you spend time looking at. If they get really lucky you'll use your mobile device and then they'll know who is in store and what they've bought before. If there's a loyalty card to combine with this, even better - then they have your home address. Buy bulk access to the electoral roll, some credit reference agencies, combine that all together and suddenly they have a pretty complete picture of your life. 


this is just quick 5 min examples of what companies can do with your data now - and using loyalty cards etc just makes their life easier. Yeah sure, in theory your data is protected by law, but in reality no-one enforces that so until they get caught they'll just keep doing it.

The idea that the entire economic impulse may be simulated using shock therapy and a little bit of cash is positively and absolutely ridiculous.  

'Human nature' is a misnomer.  'Animal instinct' would perhaps be a better term.  And animal instinct is deeply multifaceted.  What we do know is that the prime motivation, if you will, for all complex creatures is to further their own genetic legacy.  To reproduce, and to ensure the survival of our offspring, and their offspring and so on.  Presumably, a creature without this impulse would soon find itself extinct.  

That 'survival instinct' manifests itself in a number of ways within the human race, as you suggest in your comment.   It manifests itself in the need for basic goods and resources, certainly.  The more resources/food an individual has, the greater their chance of survival.  Control over resources into the future, whether by owning 'money' or by controlling land (which is far from a unique human trait, given that lions etc.. also control and mark territory as packs) is arguably ingrained within us.  

The reason for so-called 'selfless' traits then, ie. helping other people in the tribe, is not selflessness at all.  Rather, ensuring that the rest of the group survives and thrives is necessary to ensure the maximum possible chance of one's own offspring surviving.  

Dan Pink is an interesting character, but I think you blatantly misunderstand his motives.  Pink is hardly a communist, he's a self-help book writer with minimal understanding of actual biology to boot.  Doesn't make him a bad person, in fact I find a lot of his work deeply interesting, but he's quite far from an expert.  For every Dan Pink, there's a Stephen Pinker who argues the exact opposite.  

The hypothesis that if one guaranteed people the right to the basic 'means' of life, greed would be eliminated, can be almost instantly disproven.  Basic income experiments have reported mixed successes, but none of them ever eliminated greed.  The wealthy social democracies of Western Europe provide the means for citizens to obtain the basic necessities of life (food, water, shelter, some entertainment) without labour or effort, and yet the council estates of Finland are hardly utopian, crime free paradises.   Research suggests that beyond an income of about $70,000, happiness does not increase with wealth.  But said income already places you comfortably in the *top 1%* of the world.  

But even moreso, Pink's central flaw is that he doesn't understand that greed is not simply manifested in a desire for the resources necessary to survive.  It's manifested in our desire to find and attract an attractive mate, in our greed for sex, companionship, influence, power, control and fame.   Lust, jealousy (whether financial or not) and so many other human instincts and emotions are merely facets of greed/self-interest/survival instinct which exists within all of us.  What is being 'horny' if not simply being 'greedy' for sex?  

Even empathy is merely a facet of greed.  People help the old lady across the street or donate to charity because it makes them feel better *about themselves*.  It raises their own sense of self-worth, makes them feel better than those who did not donate even if they could.  

Greed *is* the expression of our survival instinct.  Certainly.  But that doesn't make it an artificial construct- quite to the contrary, it makes it a biological fact.    

---

The final quote makes one fatal mistake.  The need for food, water and shelter is biological.  But the inherent 'need' to further, expand and protect our genetic legacy is not far behind.  It is this, secondary, genetic impulse that leads to greed.  The human being is not a blank slate.  The idea that by guaranteeing shelter, food, and water, that one would eliminate the desire to best one's peers (one of the central impulses for 'mastery'), to compete for mates, to gain control and power over one's own destiny and that of fellow man, is delusional at best, and downright dangerous at worst.

Simply put, he does a job. Does he make us a worse tam when he plays? Certainly not. Is he good enough to depend upon, again I'd argue not. But for me, he's a great squad option. He thrives in situations where we're under pressure and trying to hold on to a lead. He doesn't lose possession and he presses the opposition very well. 

He doesn't add much going forward, if anything. But he is solid in the middle. The fact he isn't on particularly high wages, seems extremely professional, doesn't mind being a rotation player and is actually a good player means to me he is a great asset to the side. 

I like Joe, he knows what he is, and doesn't kick up a fuss with anyone, he just gets on with his job. He's fairly consistent in what you get with him, he struggles against big strong midfield battles because of his stature and doesn't add too much going forward.

&gt; PUTTING TASER FIGURES IN CONTEXT- Police use of tasers against under-18s attracted widespread media coverage today following the release of national statistics.
The headline figure shows tasers were drawn on around 400 juveniles nationally in 2013, including 52 in the West Midlands, whilst regional media has reported that children as young as 13 in the West Midlands have had tasers pointed at them.
On the face of it these figures can appear shocking but itâs important to understand them in context.
The most up-to-date figures (for 2014) show that 46 under-18s in the West Midlands were subject of a taser âdeploymentâ â but a taser was fired on just eight occasions, the youngest being a 14-year-old lad armed with a hammer.
In the vast majority of cases â around 75 per cent â tasers are drawn from their holster as a deterrent and not actually fired.
That was the case on three occasions in the West Midlands last year when officers came up against 13-year-olds reportedly acting violently.
They included a 999 call-out in Wolverhampton where a boy was threatening to stab people with a knife, whilst officers produced tasers against another 13-year-old in Sandwell last October after heâd thrown a knife at his grandmother and attacked her with a metal crutch.
Chief Superintendent Stuart Johnson, Head of Operations, said: âTasers are not drawn lightly by officers: they are used where there is a risk of violence and provide an additional option to resolve situations that can arise from all sections of the public, including under-18s.
âOur officers have undergone detailed training, including scenario-based events to test judgement, accuracy and the procedural and legislative side of the equipmentâs use. The training has been developed by an experienced group of taser instructors and practitioners and is subject to regular updates and review.
âIn many cases, taser has helped resolved incidents without injury; simply drawing or aiming the taser is often enough of a deterrent. Taser use is recorded every time itâs removed from its holster but our figures show that in three-quarters of cases theyâre not actually fired.
âAll taser deployments are subject of a thorough debrief by a supervising officer to ensure it was appropriate.""",null,0,null,1424875493,null,0,false,0,cowowi0,null,t3_2x39lc,null,t1_cowowi0,null,t3_2x39lc,null,null,null,1427447261,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

I'm not saying that I do not need to provide proof to convince people at all, I'm saying you asking me for a source is a waste of time, because me and others are not going to be bothered to find a load of evidence proving something we already know from our experiences to be true.

So you, as you've admitted with your 0 experience in UK legislation of young adults, or even working in an environment regulated because of young adults, have challenged an assumption someone online has told you, because you just think it's wrong.

Not because you have any experience that it's wrong, or you have knowledge on the subject that it's wrong, just because you think it's wrong based on how it fits into your own personal world view.

You don't need to believe me if I don't give you a source, I'm just telling you from my potentially made up personal experience online (which btw was ""I was trained that under 18's are considered vulnerable by default under UK law"" and also that a youth worker doesn't need to sleep with someone under their duty of care, it can be applied even if you don't work with the person directly as you're in a position of trust, which is the legal term used when dealing with vulnerable individuals, so the same applies for teachers, police officers, doctors etc).

I'm not going to be bothered to dig this shit out for you, I openly admit that. If you feel that this therefore invalidates my points and you want to carry on not believing it (with your 0 experience) then cool you do that. I'll most likely never meet you in my entire life and it has no effect on me. 

You accuse me of sounding religious, but that's based off an you saying I've said something I didn't. I didn't say you *should* believe me even though I have no proof, I said you're free not to believe me but not believing me purely because I can't be bothered to supply any sources. I'm clearly not that bothered about it, and if you aren't either then why bother asking for sources? If I gave you a list of 20 sources would you genuinely read them all? If the answer is yes then what I'd suggest is next time you don't believe someone, look it up yourself and say ""Yeah you're right"" or ""No I've just checked and you're wrong, see here here and here"".

If you don't want to do that, then you need to acknowledge other people can't be bothered to do that too, so what it essentially comes down to is your word against mine. Which is fine, you don't have to believe me, I don't care if you do, but simply not providing a source doesn't automatically mean they are wrong.

Also, you then went on to claim tasers are ""only used"" in certain circumstances, but you have no evidence for that at all.

This is in part true. Sometimes getting tested is a pain. I test usually every 3 or 6 months, but every time I go there I keep getting asked invasive questions about my sexual life by a nurse that seems to be disgusted about it. 

Last time I went to get tested nurse asked me ""Which web pages you use to cruise for men online?"". I understand that they may wanna gather some data, but I am going there to get tested, not to take part in a study about the life of gay men. Even more, if they know I go there regularly they should assume that I am already well versed in the basics of safe sex. After last time I am trying to see if I can go to a different clinic because it's not the first time I've been treated like that.

EDIT: Having said that I don't think this is the best solution for the problem. One of the reason why there is an increase of people getting infected is because the newer generations are not as educated or concerned about getting the disease. More campaigns need to be done about this. The raise of people asking for bareback sex in grindr is certainly worrying. Also, the NHS is suppose to give us protection that is ""good enough"" and to be fair condoms are ""good enough"". I have quite an active sexual life and after 4 years in London I am still testing negative.

The way you protect yourself as a cyclist is to ensure cars pass safely.  A magic helmet doesn't stop you getting clipped by a car going 30MPH past you, nor does it stop a tipper truck crushing your skull.


I think you accept that the only difference between the helmetless Dutch and ourselves is worse cycling infrastructure.

But the only risk from the lack proper cycling infrastructure is being  hit by a car, crushed by a truck.  

 All other risks are the same for the Dutch - ice,  chain snap, pothole etc. and as can be seen, you don't need a helmet to deal with those incidents.

 A helmet will do bugger all to save you from a car/truck, and there is [research](http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/articles/archive/overtaking110906.html) that indicates a helmet increases the chance of being hit - because cars over take closer when you wear a helmet.

So given the Dutch evidence that cycling itself isn't dangerous and that you don't need a helmet when pootling along at 10-15 mph, the risk in the UK comes only from traffic.

So then you either accept scientific research that indicates cars drive closer when you wear a helmet, or you choose to ignore it.  I don't really care either way.

But don't tell me I'm being unreasonable by not wearing a helmet. I've made an informed decision based on evidence, you may disagree with that decision.

Interestingly:

I don't want to knock wind or anything but it hasn't. Not one day last year did wind outperform nuclear and most of the time it's running around 3-8%. When it's really cold and we're in a high pressure anticyclone ( when the wind doesn't blow )  wind provides less than 1% which, here in the UK, is quite a lot of the time. It rarely goes over 6.5GW ( around 12% compared to nuclear at 19% ) for an install capacity of 12GW so it produces ( at max ) roughly half of its installed capacity and the rest of the time around a quarter. 

I mean if you don't believe me go to [UKgridwatch](http://www.gridwatch.templar.co.uk/) and download the [wind data](http://www.gridwatch.templar.co.uk/download.php) for last year. In fact here's last years [wind data](http://i.imgur.com/XMjupxx.png) graphed; the Y axis is MW's produced. 

This may change once we invest in offshore, the latest plans are for another  2.4GW ( which in reality will be an extra 600MW most of the time ) but we'd need a lot more than that. 

Is wind therefore a good source of renewable energy for the UK?

The ""match"" part gives you money back for any items which would have been cheaper in any of the other main supermarkets. It is totally opaque, you have no idea which items. The thing to remember is that any money you get back is just the amount they over charged you by in the first place, so they aren't exactly doing you a favour. If anything it encourages them to overcharge so that they can give you more money back. But it saves you trawling round the other shops.

The ""more"" part are points on specific items marked on the shelves. 10 points is equivalent to 1p off. Most items seem to be 100 or 200 points, so it is just a way to knock 10p off the price but make it seem like more. My experience since the scheme started is that you don't always get the discount, it seems very hit and miss.

Your points system isn't live. Your receipt shows how many points you had as of yesterday, and separately how many points you earned today. Your new points get added on overnight. So if I already have 4000 points, and I earn 1000 more, I don't get the voucher yet. The next time you go in you get the voucher. The time after that you get to actually use the voucher.

There are some damn smart and innovative people out there with a lot of money to be made if they find/develop new methods of extraction or new resources all together. People saying ""we might as well stop here ... this is good enough"" are surrendering to mediocrity.

There's actually pretty substantial effects that *hard shell* helmets protect against head and facial injury. You quoted a single study:

A [meta-analysis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/11235796/) in 2001 found substantial benefit in reducing head and facial injury.

A [re-analysis of the meta-analysis](http://www.cycle-helmets.com/elvik.pdf) in 2011 was critical of some aspects of the original, and found that they may have overemphasised the benefit - but confirmed that the benefit did exist, and that the reduction in benefit in recent years might be because soft shell helmets are becoming more popular.

Modern NATO militaries aren't interested in traditional warfare either. It's too messy and upsets too many people, even when the 'Shock and Awe' tactics showed how effectively and rapidly a NATO force of combined arms can obliterate a much larger local army and overrun a nation. Conventional invasions always end by becoming occupations and, with the firepower a lowly insurgent can now deploy, an occupation is a very expensive and miserable can of worms to open. 

It's much easier and cheaper to identify a useful local factional power within a given region to partner up with (e.g. Afghanistan's ""heroic"" Northern Alliance of opium dealers or that Libyan minority ethnic tribe who hated Gaddafi), ship them a whole lot of weaponry with few questions asked, support their efforts with drones or your own aircraft and parachute in a few units of SAS/special forces.

They both get up and down the pitch at times (and it's frustrating when Lucas does it because he makes some really nice chances for himself from time to time but is just woeful finishing).  Lucas, because of his instincts, tends to sit back a bit more, but to call his role defensive midfield is a bit false IMO. We really aren't playing with a DM, at least in the traditional sense, right now.

You're definitely right, the 12/13 second half form is a time when 4 at the back worked really well.  However, it's the only clear example of a 4 man defense working under Rodgers, and it lasted for 4 months.  Last season it didn't work, we just had Suarez/Sturridge overwhelming everyone else and outscoring them so it papered over the cracks (look at our goals conceded, only 1 other team in the top 8 conceded more than 46 goals, which was Spurs). You can argue that taking Lucas out of the holding role started the decline of this formation and I won't necessarily disagree with you because it seems a pretty clear cause/effect there.  I still stand by my opinion that with the players we have now, this season, that 3 at the back is working best for them because it caters to them best.  I don't think we'll persist with it beyond this season though and I expect to see at least 2-3 strong transfers made in the summer to help take care of this and reset our shape again.

Err, what? The definition of exploitation does not depend on how more clarity there is about the consequence of an action, if it's obvious what will happen anyway. At the risk of going rather reductio ad absurdum, leaving a loaded gun on the pavement on the street has very clear consequences, but is hardly seen as the right thing to be doing for other people. And anyway, the problem is not that people were annoyed they had to pay back Â£22.40 two weeks later, which as you say is written up loud and proud, but the bits which were written in tiny writing or not at all, such as the gigantic fees for missing payments, the rolling over of loans which added further costs on top of costs, taking Â£600 out of someone's account the day they got paid meaning they wouldn't be able to buy food or pay the bills for a month (unless they got another loan), or the false legal letters from nonexistent companies sent out threatening consequences, and the like. What they did was wrong, and the fact that even the company has admitted it suggests that you writing like they are angels of light protecting people from the greater problem of loansharks is completely without any justification, particularly as it's fairly obvious how the number of people in terrible financial problems due to these loan companies far, far exceeded the numbers in financial problems before these companies existed. Want to have a guess what will happen to those numbers if the companies cease to exist again?

&gt;Much like prostitution or drugs, the market still exists but is driven underground or people turn to other means to get the same product.

&gt;The __Hershey Process__ [milk chocolate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_chocolate) used in these bars is cheaper to make than other types of [chocolate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate) as it is less sensitive to the freshness of the [milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk). The [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process) was developed by [Milton Hershey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_S._Hershey) and was the first mass-produced chocolate in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). As a result, the Hershey flavor is widely recognized in the United States, but less so internationally, in particular in areas where [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) chocolates are more widely available. The process is a [trade secret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret), but experts speculate that the milk is partially [lipolyzed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipolysis), producing [butyric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butyric_acid), which stabilizes the milk from further fermentation. This [compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound) gives the product a particular sour, ""tangy"" taste, to which the US public has become accustomed, to the point that other [manufacturers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturers) often add [butyric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butyric_acid) to their milk chocolates.  The American bar's taste profile was not as popular with the Canadian public, leading Hershey to introduce a reformulated Canadian bar in 1983.  The company describes the revised Canadian formulation as a ""creamier, smoother, lighter coloured and milder flavoured product more suitable to Canadian taste"". Butyric acid is a component which provides the characteristic smell of human vomit,  and many Europeans describe the taste of Hershey bars as reminding them of vomit, even if they do not know the underlying chemistry.

I like Henderson but if you apply pressure on him, his technical level drops. And that's the different between Henderson and Iniesta. It's not so much that there is a vast level of technical quality between them, it's just the mindset of Iniesta dwarfs Hendersons'. So when pressure is applied, Iniesta can make the pass or can turn the man, whereas Henderson can't. I agree that certain players can play for Barcelona. Coutinho could. And I think Lallana could as well. Perhaps Can. I think Allen is the most comfortable player with the ball in our squad though. He's not fazed as much with pressure as say Henderson. In fact, Barcelona are so good with dealing with pressure that sometimes they invite it on purpose to create space for the forwards to work with. I don't think there is a team in the world who are as confident as they are with the ball.

Barcelona don't control space and pack it tight with players at all. They pressurize opponents and are more than happy hunting with 3 men as opposed to Rodgers who doesn't. We don't press like Barcelona do. We only usually allow 1 player to go to the man. Barcelona take risks when pressing but are experts at doing so, so they rarely make mistakes.

In 1991 we had Gascoigne and Linekar so it was great times and there was lots of hype surrounding the club. 

Gascoigne was Englands Maradona and probably the most gifted English player produced in the past 30-40 years. He had everything vision, passing, touch, skill, finishing and passion. Unfortunately like Maradona he also had his demons that got the better of him.

Linekar was just a natural finisher, create chances and he would finish all of them. Sort of an English Ruud van Nistelrooy.

Darren Anderton was a great winger. Played very wide but had great passing and crossing ability also had a great shot. Wasn't overly flashy but was very effective.

David Ginola personified Spurs, just about the silkiest player you can imagine. Everything he did was smooth and flashy. Wasn't always the most effective but always had class and entertainment. Watching Ginola week in week out was exciting times for Spurs fans.

Teddy Sheringham probably one of the most underrated English players in recent times. Teddy was just fantastic in and around the box, very very intelligent player. Would create endless chances and was very dominant in the air. Had a fine finish on him too.

Obviously some notable omissions like Klinsmann, Freund, Barmby, Carr, Carrick, Davids and many more.

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt; What does being threatening mean? For me to consider electrocuting a child, they would need to be holding a serious knife or a gun and waving it about.

Given the Police attend *hundreds of thousands* of calls a year, drew their tasers on 400 occasions and actually discharged them on 37, I'd say (unless you've been through all the incidents yourself?) that it's probably reasonable to suggest those cases were the worst of the worst.

&gt;At the point that this is happening, there have been repeated failures all the way down the line with how that child has been handled.

I don't disagree with you. But if a person (child/adult - doesn't actually matter), is actually armed, and is presenting a threat to life, then that is *all* the Police are dealing with. That is the *only* thing that is relevant.

Oh, so there's a terrible story about how this kid has been bumped from pillar to post through various foster services? Doesn't matter - they're throwing knives at people having just battered their granny with a metal bar? Get them in cuffs. Or you know, you go stand downrange - we'll stand behind you if that's okay.

Disarm them, and prevent them being a threat to others or themselves.

Yes, we know we have serious problems in the other parts of the justice system - how that child will then proceed through court, how the child services are set up, the ""rehabilitation"" offered by the Youth Offender Institutes - all greatly lacking.

But that is all *utterly irrelevant* to a Police Officer who is faced with a subject waving a weapon around who is either threatening to hurt someone (or themselves), or who may indeed already have done so.

If a kid has just stabbed someone (who is now bleeding out), and is standing over the body, the rights of that child are secondary to the urgency with which you need to let paramedics treat the stab victim. If that means you tase the kid, get them in cuffs and argue the toss later, then so be it.

Allowing someone to bleed to death because you didn't feel comfortable using non-lethal force against their (under-18) attacker is basically manslaughter. You *could* have detained the attacker and allowed paramedics to treat the victim, but you didn't.

The job of Police is to remove the threat and take them to a place of safety. If Child Services do a lousy job once the person is handed into their custody, that's not the fault of the Police. And it has nothing whatsoever to do with whether the Police are using CS, tasers, batons or even firearms in the execution of their duty to public safety.

&gt; I can think of very few situations where people would need to either taser or baton children.

And therein lies the problem. The word ""child"" means everything from a 10 year old to a 17 year old. I can think of lots of cases where a 6""6' seventeen year old might be in a position to pose a significant threat to life.

---

&gt;__Betteridge's law of headlines__ is an [adage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adage) that states: ""Any [headline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headline) which ends in a [question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark) can be answered by the word *no*."" It is named after Ian Betteridge, a British technology journalist,  although the general concept is much older.  The observation has also been called ""__Davis' law__""   or just the ""__journalistic principle__"".  In the field of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics), the concept, referring to the titles of research papers, has been referred to as __Hinchliffe's Rule__  since before 1988.

My mum was lucky with her parents, in a way.  She has 2 sisters.  My grandad died within a week of getting sick. My nan suffered dementia for years after that, and between the 3 of them they were able to look after her. Admittedly one did quit her part time job to care for her more so than the other 2, and she took some money from the inheritance for doing that, but not much.

So when she did die, there was still plenty to share out.  My mum took her share, around 150k I think, and did up her entire house. It was a 3 bed semi detached at the end of a cul-de-sac ... her and her husband and worked hard to afford it anyway, and decided to spruce it up with the money. Extension, new kitchen, redecorated, the lot.

2 years late, they can't afford the mortgage any more, had to sell up and move to a shitty 1 bedroom flat.  It's fucking heartbreaking because they spent all that time and money making a home and still they were squeezed out and basically lost all that money in the process.

null,false,nifara,null,null,null,"The other answers to this question really don't go into enough depth and misrepresent some of the details.

After the change in how universities were funded there was a big clamour by students to get ""more for their money"" as they were footing a much bigger bill. To compete, universities are being forced to invest in teaching and contact hours to keep up, when previously the model of ""education by osmosis"" was seen as acceptable (i.e. you get an education at university by being in an academic environment and whilst teaching occurs the primary mechanism of that education is self-directed study and access to resource). That's no longer on the cards as the model of higher education is shifting to a more tuition-centric form. That raises costs, and whether the government intended that or not I don't know.

What I DO know is that after the hike universities were actually receiving funding much more unevenly. Previously government funding to HE required ""spending of equivalence"" - that meant that money had to go to ""softer"" subjects like the humanities as well as to STEM, etc. Budgets for infrastructure spending were kept low to ensure money went on subject resources. The shift in funding was remarkably well timed to coincide with the point in time when university infrastructure created by the last big funding bump was reaching end of life, intentionally or not.

Now that universities can direct their own funding they have broadly taken the opportunity to invest in infrastructure, which has been crumbling for decades. But that leaves less in the pot for teaching and teaching requirement have gone up. Universities have responded by cutting funding to the places that can easily scrape by with less - the arts and humanities.

That means that if you go to university now to study STEM subjects you're in luck: you'll have new buildings going up, better resources, and probably more money per student spent. If you're going for any other subject however, you're looking at less money spent on your education by a long way.

To give some rough numbers on this: at the university I worked at when this change went through the Chemistry department was getting effectively the same amount per student as they did previously, and soil science (a specialty of the uni) was actually getting more. But English Lit was getting about a third of what they had previously per student. That led to the best academics in that department, and other affected, jumping ship sharpish.

So in conclusion, HE funding has been problematic for much longer than you'd think, and infrastructure suffered because of it. Now universities can spend how they like, that infrastructure is improving. But some subjects are missing out badly, and the requirements for contact hours are much much higher than they were.

Your first option is to walk up to them and physically restrain them. If they have a weapon, then that may not be appropriate.

If you're in London, you'll be okay because they have borough support units - basically 6 guys in riot gear in the back of a minibus.
If you really need to, they can come, press the subject against a wall using their plastic riots shields and affect an entirely physical arrest like that. It's one of the things riot specialists do when there aren't any riots to Police.

Most officers outside of central London do not have that sort of support available. In my rural patch, there's often only one officer on duty. If they're called to a domestic disturbance they could be facing off an angry spouse on they're own. My uncle had that once in his rural patch. CS'd the guy, and then ended up grappling for 30 seconds before the CS took effect. Turned out it was a bad batch with a delayed reaction.
My uncle's a big guy. If he'd been smaller he might have suffered serious injuries in the 30 seconds the subject was throwing punches.

So if simple restraint (or borough support) is out, then that leaves them with belt kit - Baton, CS or Taser.

CS spray isn't effective on 100% of people, and also, being aerosoled, can splash back at the officers. Basically, it's okay if you've got hold of an unarmed individual who needs subduing whilst you get them into cuffs, but you wouldn't run up to someone holding any sort of a weapon (whether that's a hammer, knife or length of lead pipe) to hit them with CS.

Not unless you've got CS canisters to hand that you can lob at them from a safe distance... and they're definitely not standard issue!

If CS is out, that leaves Baton and Taser.

Depending on their clothing, tasers may not be appropriate (thick puffa jackets, etc), so they have to call it case-by-case.
The long-term damage of tasers is a ""known unknown"" - we're not entirely sure, but most people walk it off pretty quick.

The short term damage of batons is very well understood (broken bones). The long-term damage depends on which bones get broken - straight fractures may heal quickly whilst shattered wrists can be a lifelong impediment.

Personally? I'll take the taser every time over getting hit with a baton.

Many of the Professors are the authority in their fields and have been Law Commissioners, shaping Scots law.  This means that the teaching and courses have a largely academic focus, rather than a practical focus. This is particularly true in your third and fourth years. Other Scottish universities do focus on the practical aspects of the law more than Edinburgh. 

As a city, I'd pick Edinburgh over Glasgow. They're both nice cities, but I much prefer Edinburgh. It's small, but packed with things to do, places to eat and drink and cultural activities. It's also very picturesque. 

I would warn you that Scots law is significantly different to most US legal system, which are based on English law. Louisiana is closest to Scots law, but all other states are very different. This won't be much of an issue for some areas - corporate law is very similar. But for property law, the entire system, basis and practice, is completely different. 

This won't prevent you practicing in the US, but it will make things a bit more difficult.

Now your changing what was said - you were talking about getting annoyed with cyclists not pulling in when they pass a layby.
You should safely overtake when visibility is good, not at 90 mph screaming an insult dangerously around a corner. You probably won't have to wait long, but if you don't like waiting that's your problem, not the cyclists.
Cyclists ""riding in the middle of the lanes"" are normally doing it to be clearly visible or because it isn't safe to overtake going around a blind corner.

&gt; Also I find driving enjoyable a lot of the time as do many others.

But it isn't enjoyable most of the time. When you're sat in traffic or going through a set of busy junctions its crap. Horrible even. Transportation is not a leisure activity despite all the flashy marketing car companies put out there. If you find it fun sometimes great. But that's not the point of roads or why we bother to drive most places. Some people might like washing up greasy pans or lugging crates around, but that's not why we do these things; they are chores.

Walker - Dier - Vertonghen - Rose

Bentaleb - Stambouli/Dembele

Lamela - Eriksen - Townsend

Soldado

Definitely expecting Soldado up top after his recent performances and giving Kane a rest for Wembley, would like to see Lamela on the bench but he has some experience against Italian sides. I think it's time to give Mason a break too after a few lackluster performances.

Hopefully Poch doesnt go with the Lamela-Dembele-Eriksen attacking line, Dembele was awful last game and Eriksen is more effective as the 10.

The *really* amazing thing was that one person claimed I'd added that later and he would have agreed with me if it had been there originally. Yet it was always there. 

What I presume happened was that people read ""I actually feel a little sorry for her"" and a red mist descended. These people don't want to understand that woman, to persuade her, to talk rationally about the issues, and work out what needs to be done to solve them not just for her but for others like her too. They want to *hurt* her, to *hunt* her, and to point at her and condemn her: to cast her out. The sheer depth of hatred which was expressed took me very much by surprise. But if you are not standing with the mob and hurling stones, then the stones come your way too.

That attitude will make the divisions worse and let extremism rise.  Aggression breads aggression. I prefer MLK's approach: pity those people, feel sorry for them, and help them to change. They must be miserable, to be full of hate.

Universities make very little, if any at all, profit from tuition fees alone.

I go to one of the largest universities in the UK in terms of student population, yet tuition fees don't even cover half of the annual total expenditure...

Some courses cost a lot more to run than others obviously, some course will bring in a tidy profit. Though many simple do not, for example my course makes frequently makes use of equipment that costs Â£15,000 in the most basic form, the equipment we actually have is worth well over Â£40,000 each, and we have access to 4 of them within my department alone. These machines are only 1 part of a much wider laboratory. 

Compare that to someone I know who did a degree in the history of art (nothing wrong with that, please don't mistake what I am saying here.) which had no specialist equipment etc and it's clear that the running costs of my degree programme vastly outweigh the costs of running a history of art programme. 

But as a whole, universities often don't even make enough to money to sustain current operations from tuitions, never mind amassing fortunes.

Put it in perspective though.  Barcelona is an every year UCL participant and they usually get fairly far.  Man City is still considered newbies to the tournament as far as consistently participating.  I mean, this is only our 4th year consistently competing in this competition.  There is a wealth of prestige against us.  


We should be doing better, I agree with that.  But I am still proud that we didn't just toss that game away.  It very well could have ended 1-3 and that would have almost kicked the bucket for us.  We are still alive.  We are still kicking.  This isn't the end.  I am proud of our boys waking up after a hard to watch first half and making something out of seemingly nothing.  We are facing a new Barcelona dynamic and we adapted.  Now we have that experience to take into the next match.  We are going to get chances and if we can capitalize, we could be going into the round of 8.  I am being optimistic, but any team can be defeated.  There is no infallible team out there.  We can beat them.

Big differences: I admitted my actions freely and admitted my failures. Unlike many police and their supporters. My use of force did not cause any pain, as admitted by the person who I had used force against. It was also not intended to cause pain. 

So it isn't me ignoring the specifics. 

Having repeatedly seen Police use violence as a first rather than last option, I am more than prepared to believe that at least some of these cases were the result of trigger happiness/sadism rather than necessity. 

Finally, I am not a police officer. I expect Police, being given the level of power that they have, to use a higher level of ethics and integrity than civilians like me.

Now you have to make 50 transactions in a year to qualify for them for a year, not great if you only buy from time to time but for commuters or people like me who work near a Starbucks, it does soon adds up. They also have random perks throughout the year, sometimes they give you double stars during certain hours or if you buy a certain drink, so you can reach the targets faster. The other week they gave me a free drink and one of them reusable coffee cups for the hell of it, just because I had a card. The best tip for it is you can part pay with your card and still get a star, so you can top up a fiver, pay 50p from the card and pay the rest via any other method and it'll still count. Plus, if you're with friends, if you're the only cardholder (like me), I pay for everyones drinks but all in separate transactions, so then I get their stars. It's per transaction, not per drink, so whatever you order, pay for it all separately, it's a pain in the arse but you can rack up 4+ stars from going for coffee and cake with a mate.

Most of the meeting was about how DA Notices work, the abuse question is shut down very quickly...

&gt;During the last 6 months the Secretary had responded to 16 enquiries about the workings of the DA Notice System: from the media themselves, officials, academics, fringe organisations and members of the public. Several of these enquiries were triggered by concerns that the DA Notice System was being used/abused to cover up crimes or abuses by senior members of past governments. It was in the nature of the internet that a scurrilous accusation can be made without any supporting evidence and then be taken up by other equally eccentric commentators as âgospelâ. There was little that could be done about this, and the Secretary said that it was rarely wise to try to refute such accusations as that was often cited as confirmation that the allegations were true.

null,false,MrFuckingRandom,null,null,null,"I'm currently studying Law at Glasgow and I would pick there. Rankings-wise, it's the best univesrity for Law in Scotland, and 5th best in the UK. It's one of 8 universities in the UK to require prospective students to sit the LNAT exam, and applicants currently require straight A's at Scottish higher level. That gives you an idea of how selective they are. They can afford to be. In terms of selection, all employers look at degree classifications first but in the 2:1 category, Glasgow trumps Edinburgh.

In terms of staff, Glasgow also edges it for me. Professors like Adam Tomkins, Janeen Carruthers, Tom Guthrie and James Chalmers (stolen from Edinburgh) are simply on another level. There are a number of international lecturers and tutors also such as Ernest Metzger, who is a leading figure in Roman law and a fellow American like you. 

For facilities, it has the entire 7th floor of the university library and it's own Law library in a dedicated building beside the court room which is used for moots, both inside the degree and out.

Socially, Glasgow has a livelier campus than Edinburgh (and that Hogwarts charm), and a diverse student population. You might find that Edinburgh does indeed have a slightly higher American student population but as some of the comments here are suggesting you do, they pick Edinburgh for the pretty city. That's not why you do a degree.

Cost-wise, since your aim *is* to save money, living costs are lower in Glasgow as Edinburgh landlords cash in on the tourists (and the English).

Every university has it's good points and bad points. However, you need to remember why you do a degree and academics must come first. That's one of the gripes I have with people arguing that strathclyde is better because it's 'more practical' whereas Glasgow is academic. If academia is your priority, Glasgow is your best bet. If you are drawn to your surroundings or your fellow countrymen(should they be more numerous elsewhere) then its logical to look elsewhere. 

Hopefully, you'll get an Edinburgh perspective as well, but if you have any questions, I'll answer them here or via PM.

We were up for it against Man Utd, but can we be up for Burnley away? They are full on fighting now, motivation is *not* an issue they have to deal with. One thing we have going for us in that department is that a win gets us to 40, which Monk *may* use to spur us on; thenagain, he might not want to as it raises a bigger problem for the game after, although because that's Liverpool it might not be an issue, because everyone wants to win those games. Motivation is complicated.

What team will Monk pick? No idea. The side against Man Utd looked like a team for a job, and I don't think Monk will employ the same tactics against a vastly different side in Burnley.

null,false,chrisjd,null,null,null,"&gt; In my opinion we just have too many people because of open borders/poor immigration policy. It's the main reason this housing is needed. I don't see why our government's did this at all. It's not like we needed more people in Britain. Not to this extent at least.

4 reasons I can think of off the top of my head

1. We are in the EU so have to open the borders to other EU countries. Of course the (over) simple answer is to leave the EU but there are lots of pros and cons of being in the EU and you have to consider them as a package.
2. Immigrants contribute to the economy, they are more likely to work than people born here, so they are paying taxes and making profits for their employers etc.
3. We do actually need more people - we have an ageing population because millions of people approaching retirement but as a whole British people haven't had enough kids to replace themselves. We need a certain level of immigration to stop the working population from shrinking and to keep the ratio of workers (and taxpayers) to pensioners (who are a drain on the treasury) stable.
4. There are unintended consequences of trying to reduce immigration. Universities is one example, they love foreign students as there's no limit to how much they can charge them and they get the money upfront, so it's a big earner for them which subsidies British students to some extent. When the current government tried to clamp down on immigration they tried to restrict the number of student visas issues, which caused the universities huge cash-flow problems and the policy had to be reversed. Now the policy has been to tighten up on allowing students to stay after university, they are more likely to be sent straight home. All this means though is we're sending the brightest immigrants away, we should be encouraging skilled immigrants to stay!",null,0,null,1424890370,null,0,false,0,cowxo7s,null,t3_2x22j3,null,t1_cowxo7s,null,t1_cowq2yd,null,null,null,1427451597,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

In the first instance, there is no equivalence. These people aren't joining an edgy organisation at the fringes of society - they're travelling a quarter of the way around the world to join a group of people who seem to divide their time equally between committing atrocities and posting photos of themselves with severed heads to twitter.

Secondly, there is no degree of naivety or wordly innocence which encompasses the ability to elope to Syria **and** ignorance of exactly what ISIS are up to over there. It doesn't require a particular set of skills, they are actively engaged in shouting about their activities using every form of communication known to man.

Lastly - they have a stupid romanticised notion of what's happened and think it will all be a grand adventure. I actually agree that it's quite likely they'll regret their decision fairly quickly, the important part though is that I will not sympathise.

The reality is most students won't pay back much of their loan costs under the current system, and will only do it when they're earning enough. It's not something you have to think about while you're at uni.

Living costs on the other hand are an immediate expense, and most people don't get a large enough maintenance loan to even cover accommodation costs. So unless your parents are wealthy enough to pay the gap, you are screwed. I do agree that people in the middle get squeezed the most. People at the very lowest end of the scale get a large grant and loan. Very wealthy people can have their parents pay. The trouble is for people (like me) whose parents are not wealthy enough to help me out, but also not poor enough to qualify for a livable loan.

 [**Texaco Cup**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texaco%20Cup): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __Texaco Cup__ was an [association football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) competition involving clubs from [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland), the [Republic of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland) and [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland) that had not qualified for European competitions.

&gt;Irish and Northern Irish clubs withdrew from the competition after 1971â72 due to political pressure,  and in 1973â74 and 1974â75 competed in a separate [Texaco (All-Ireland) Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texaco_(All-Ireland\)_Cup).  The tournament was sponsored by American petroleum giant [Texaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texaco) to the tune of Â£100,000, and was instituted to help promote their recent purchase of the Regent filling station chain. 

&gt;The cup became the [Anglo-Scottish Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Scottish_Cup) from 1975â76 after the withdrawal of Texaco's sponsorship.

If we fall behind early though, you need leadership on the field to keep the team from conceding a second. Young players will rush forward to try to undo their mistake, when really we will need to settle down and possess the ball.

The truth is, every formation change and team selection carries risks and rewards. Rodgers is betting on youth in an away game in Turkey. The truth is our hands are tied with such an important fixture on the weekend, and I'm excited to see this young team play, especially with Can in midfield. 

Even if we fall short, I don't expect Rodgers to take too much criticism for his selection, I just wanted to point out that our bench will not provide as many solutions as it typically does should we fall behind, and it's a potential weakness.

He's a distinctly average Premier League keeper and anyone who's been an Evertonian long enough to remember our previous first team keeper, Nigel Martyn, will recognize that. He's been protected over the years by the quality defences David Moyes built time and time again.

Last year he had his best year for Everton and probably his best year ever. He carried that form into the World Cup but got vastly over-hyped in terms of his own quality by the media and more so by casual fans.

This year he's been horrendous. Probably his worst year ever. Whether he's bought into that hype himself is a real possibility. Constant mistakes and he's cost us a hell of a lot of points on his own. Obviously he's not the only problem we've had this year but he's a pretty big one.

Look at the time he spent out of the side this year. The results and defensive record improved tenfold.

&gt;

&gt;The __Cartmel Masterplan__ is a fan name for the planned *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)* [backstory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstory) developed primarily by [Andrew Cartmel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cartmel), [Ben Aaronovitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Aaronovitch), and [Marc Platt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Platt_(writer\)), which they intended to restore some of the mystery of [the Doctor's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)) background that had been lost through revelation of the existing backstory.  Although hints were dropped in the last two seasons, the proposed revelations never materialised on screen as the programme was not renewed for another season in 1990.

&gt;Some of the stories during the [Seventh Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Doctor)'s tenure were intended to deal with the lack of mystery by suggesting that much of what was believed about the Doctor was wrong and that he was a far more powerful and mysterious figure than previously thought. In an untelevised scene in *[Remembrance of the Daleks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_the_Daleks)*, the Doctor stated that he was ""far more than just another [Time Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord)."" In *[Silver Nemesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Nemesis)*, lines about the creation of [validium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_items#Validium) and Lady Peinforte knowing the Doctor's secrets were meant to point towards this mystery. 

&gt;The suspension of the series in 1989 meant that none of these hints were ever resolved.  The ""Masterplan"" was used as a guide for the [Virgin New Adventures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_New_Adventures) series of novels featuring the Seventh Doctor,  and the revelations about the Doctor's origins were written into the novel *[Lungbarrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungbarrow)* by Marc Platt.

If anything there's too many in the world and we should be encouraging people  to scale back. As a Green party supporter I would have thought you'd be behind that. Less people, less pollution, better environment. 

We've increased our population by at least 7.5 Million people with immigration since 2001. Even with scaling that seems like an excessive pyramid scheme in the making. I suppose they're all going to go home and not grow old here. Even if half do, 3.5 million is a massive population increase that will need to be paid for, by more future immigration I expect. That will also need housing.

 As for it benefiting the economy, I was around in the 1980's, before mass immigration. We weren't exactly living a hard life then. Now we need to spend billions on housing and build on our green belt. 

Our whole immigration policy and enforcement is a joke. Student's visa's are a massive problem. There's a whole Eu money scam going on with it too.

Dear Sir/Madam, 

Please send me all data you hold on me, this should include but is not limited to loans, credit cards and mortgages.  I expect a response within 40 days and look forward to hearing back from you...blah blah etc.

Include for reference and to save time in case they struggle to find you; date of birth, a current account number, previous addresses, proof of current address (dated within 3 months) and make sure you sign the letter as this is you giving them permission to search on your behalf.

null,false,IxionS3,null,null,null,"&gt; First of all, does a bond differ to an ISA that much?

A bond in this context is just a cash deposit with a fixed interest rate and a fixed term.  It differs from an ISA in that the interest is not automatically tax free.

&gt; Secondly, the page here[1] says that they will pay the interest GROSS or NET depending on my tax status. Have I mistaken this for an ISA?

Apparently.  Savings providers are obliged to pay interest NET of basic rate income tax unless they have a declaration from the saver that they are not a taxpayer or they are offering an ISA or similar tax free account.  Since the bond you are looking at is not within an ISA they must tax your interest unless you make the right declaration.

&gt; And if so, if I'm a full time student, what will that mean when my bond matures? I am not a taxpayer at the moment as I don't work, so will I lose some of the money I'd get from the interest if it's paid NET? 

Yes, you will lose 20% of the interest unless you declare that you are entitled to gross interest.

There are fixed rate term ISAs around, but the best 2 year deal seems to be 1.95% with the Post Office - to get better than that you have to go longer.  So for a non-taxpayer the 2.2% non-ISA bond may be the better deal, so long as you don't mind moving your money outside the ISA system, bearing in mind that putting it back in later will count against your ISA allowance in that year.

null,false,chrisjd,null,null,null,"&gt; I don't understand what this fixation is with having 'more people'. If anything there's too many in the world and we should be encouraging people to scale back. As a Green party supporter I would have thought you'd be behind that. Less people, less pollution, better environment.

This argument makes no sense, immigration does not create people, they don't pop into existence at the border. Less immigration does not equal less people, just people in different places.

&gt; As for scaling the population to meet the ageing population. We've increased it by at least 7.5 Million people with immigration since 2001. Even with scaling that seems like an excessive pyramid scheme in the making. I suppose they're all going to go home and not grow old here. Even if half do, 3 million is a massive increase that will need to be paid for, by more future immigration I expect.

The OBR has worked out that [we need another 6 million immigrants](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10185342/Britain-needs-millions-more-immigrants-to-reduce-strain-of-ageing-population.html): 

&gt; The report found that allowing more than 140,000 immigrants into Britain a year, equivalent to 6million people, would help increase the overall number of people who are in work and improve public finances.

&gt; Its analysis suggests that Britain's borrowing as a propotion of GDP would rise to 99 per cent if there is a steady flow of immigrants. If there was a complete ban on immigrants, borrowing would rise to 174 per cent of GDP.

Without these numbers we're going to have to borrow massively or raise taxes on the working population to pay for pensioners. 

&gt; As for it benefiting the economy, I was around in the 1980's, before mass immigration. We weren't exactly living a hard life then. I'm not quite sure who it's benefited but it's hasn't been me. Now we need to spend billions on housing and build on our green belt. It sounds like someone's benefiting somewhere.

It's benefited the economy as a whole, but economic growth since the 1980s hasn't been evenly shares. That's not just do with immigration, but with productivity gains in general, a higher share of GDP goes to profits which get paid out in dividends and a higher share of wages goes to the top 1%. The economy does need to be changed to work for ordinary people and not just benefit the richest, but that's a separate issue.",null,0,null,1424895246,null,0,false,0,cox0vmo,null,t3_2x22j3,null,t1_cox0vmo,null,t1_cowzwpn,null,null,null,1427453164,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null
null,false,domalino,logo,,null,"I reckon Denayer will come in next year to replace Nastasic as fourth choice. He looks much more like a Pellegrini CB than Rekik, and he's better at the moment anyway. Rekik is in a PSV team that is doing well, but I don't think he's standing out much and they aren't really challenged much. Denayer has been showing real signs of quality even in games like the 3-3 vs. Inter last week - he was pretty good while Van Dijk and Celtic's defending were terrible. 

Then Lopes will come in for Lampard, he's definitely ready now, he looked almost good enough 18 months ago by while injured at Lille he's bulked up a lot. 

Iheanacho might get trusted with that 4th striker spot if Jovetic leaves and he has as good a preseason s he did this season. 

Ambrose might make a few appearances but I'd rather see him go on loan. He doesn't fit the team anyway because he's playing RW in a 4-3-3 in the EDS. 

So there's loads of reasons to be positive - we genuinely could have 3 youth players in the squad next season, just 4 or 5 months away. We know the owners want it, we know Pellegrini will do it if he can. 

To be honest I think more EDS members in the squad is the way to beat FFP anyway. You look at Chelsea and they only have 20 players, plus youth products, but those 20 players are all very good. Same for Barca, Bayern and Real. Smaller but world class squads supplemented with cheap youth players.

To run through it briefly. Every July and November, the club has a bulk sale. The sale in July lets you buy tickets for the first half of the season (so August up until New Year's Day) and the November sale is the second half of the season (January to May). I think there's about 10,000 in the sale for each game.


This is where it gets interesting/silly, and I'm typing this from the best of my recollection!

Now the Category **A** + **B** games, the 10,000 gets split (about 5,000 each) between two different sets of criteria of supporters:

* Those with 14+ games from the previous season
* And those with 0 games

It can be a pain in the arse to get online, especially in the 0 sales, but once you do get on it does allow you to get your tickets sorted.

Now Category **C** games, I THINK they start out on 0. They don't hold an exclusive sale for those with 14+. I may be/probably am wrong.

Now Everton/Manchester United, they usually never drop down to 0 games. They usually have a sale for 14+, and then drop to 8 previous games, 7 previous games, etc, and then sell out as they're the biggest games.

Now, those are the bulk sales! Think you've missed out? Think again!

http://www.liverpoolfc.com/tickets/tickets-availability

Look at this page. Scroll down to the QPR game. It says sold out, right? So they're sold out? **WRONG!**

That page is a lying **bastard**. It changes, and it's up to you to keep an eye on it. Last week it said that Manchester City had sold out. Now it says there was a sale yesterday at 11am.

Oh yes, that's another thing. There are at least 2 or 3 further sales for EVERY home game. Usually a few weeks before the match.

There's a general sale, which allows you to purchase up to 4 tickets without a membership, and there's a late availability Members sale, usually in the week running up to the match.

Cup games? I'd explain more but I'm off out shortly!

If you have any more questions. Please feel free to ask more.

I was recently in Thailand on a very short, 5 day holiday.

One of my activities was snorkeling the Similan Islands. The water is stunning, just snorkeling we saw sea turtles, an eel, barricuda, loads of fish and some pretty reefs. That being said, I really got the vibe that Southern Thailand is extremely over-touristy. There's loads of tourists. The Similans, for example, are tiny and an hour speed boat  ride off the coast, but there were hundreds of tourists filling them up with dozens of 3-4 engine speed boats anchored off the small beach. I suspect in a few years the water will be just as bad as the other touristy areas, but for now it's still very clean save some stray plastic bags that our group leader gathered from the sea floor. Still very pretty.

I'd be more apt to recommend something more isolated, like off the coast of Africa, Mauritius is quite nice, or Madagascar. Less tourists, I think. Mauritius was totally amazing when I went, no tourists whatsoever, but it's been a decade so I have no idea what it's like now.

FYI, I almost did this one from Phuket, but I didn't have time with my other activities, it's reasonably priced and there's a 2 day PADI certification course:
