&gt;CJ381 Recognising the nature of the female prison population, with high levels of mental illness, experience of being a victim of crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence, and caring responsibilities for children, the only women who should be in custody are those very few that commit serious and violent crimes and who present a threat to the public.

&gt;CJ382 For the vast majority of women in the criminal justice system, solutions in the community are more appropriate. Community sentences must be designed to take account of women’s particular vulnerabilities and domestic and childcare commitments. The restrictions placed on sentencers around breaches of community orders must be made more flexible.

&gt;CJ383 Existing women’s prisons should be replaced with suitable geographically dispersed, small, multi-functional custodial centres. More supported accommodation should be provided for women on release to break the cycle of repeat offending and custody.

null,false,Muzer0,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,null,"Yeah. I mean, the reason the Northern franchise exists is because it was decided (for whatever reason) to split off the profit-making faster services in the North (ie TransPennine Express) — the things that politicians wary of too much public money being spent could quite happily be seen to be investing in — from the loss-making local and commuter services, which became Northern. So really, the company running the Northern Rail franchise, even if they WERE allowed to invest, has no financial incentive to do so, since their services will STILL be (by and large) loss-making unless a miracle happens. Rail investments are generally longer term than franchising periods, so *in general* you can't expect a franchise holder to invest in new trains unless it's agreed and paid for in the franchise specification. The main exception to this is Chiltern Railways. Why is this an exception? Because they were let a twenty-year franchise under an experiment by the Strategic Rail Authority (now disbanded)! So they have actually been funding a whole load of investment and have turned the fortunes of their main route around completely. Just goes to show how a little long-term thinking could go a long way.

So yeah, I would say that certainly, Northern Rail the company along with the Northern commuters are definitely victims of the franchising system. The main issue is that with the economy being unpredictable, the industry changes too fast for the franchising system to keep up. The only way to fix this would be to specify *even shorter* franchises, which would be even worse for long-term thinking, or much longer ones, which might not work as well in naturally loss-making areas, and runs the risk of getting stuck with a company doing poorly.

The whole franchising system is a bit of a mess, basically. But unfortunately many of the alternatives I've heard are worse. If you're going to renationalise, fine (in my opinion), but a few things need to happen — first, the level of investment must remain. It can't be used as an excuse to reduce investment (privatisation could actually be seen as an excuse to INCREASE investment, since it HAS gone up quite significantly since the end of British Rail). Second, the existing setup should be scrapped entirely. Well, having said that, Network Rail can remain — having a separate organisation handling track to trains does have advantages as well as disadvantages. But the passenger operators should be grouped by purpose, not by area, as it was in the final evolution of British Rail (where you had InterCity, Network SouthEast and Regional Railways). That seems to be the most cost-efficient model, and quite a good one for uniform branding too. And they shouldn't be in any way franchised or restricted in vision — long-term thinking should be encouraged.",null,0,null,1429829050,null,0,false,0,cqmj7r5,null,t3_33li6n,null,t1_cqmj7r5,null,t1_cqmhvis,null,null,null,1432566563,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

At the beginning I did paper trading - i.e. simulated trading without real money - on [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/) and [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/portfolio) (Create a portfolio then Add transaction data) and I tried different strategies, picking stocks, picking funds/etfs. 

I eventually settled on some funds because my individual stock picking was more or less random and I didn't have that much time to invest into trading frequently. I had 15k in a low interest savings account and opened an ISA with iWeb (they recently changed their account opening fee from 25 to 200) and invested in ETFs.  I think my first portfolio was S&amp;P500, NASDAQ100, Biotech and some US small cap - somewhat risky stuff. Gradually I realised that I'm not that well diversified and I transferred everything to Vanguard LS100 a few months ago.

Right now I'm educating myself on algorithmic trading and options and testing out new strategies with paper trading.

To be clear, I believe the majority of the train service in this country to be very good. Of course, if you're a commuter, you're going to mostly remember the bad experiences. As an enthusiast who travels across the whole country on a semi-regular basis, on every type of line from the 0.8-mile Stourbridge branch line to High Speed 1, from the slowest to the fastest trains, from the worst to the best, I feel that I get a much more balanced experience of what train travel is like here on the whole. And yes, aside from the price, I do believe that it compares favourably to Europe. We are worse in some areas, but they are worse in others, which is what many seem to overlook.

Don't get me wrong, the trains in Europe were mostly perfectly reasonable. But they were getting old, and many of them would need replacing to be half as efficient as our stuff. I mean, they were still using loco-hauled trains on a lot of regional and local routes! But if most of our trains were that old, we'd probably have more spacious interiors and comfortable seats, since the general trend in train design around Europe (including Britain), certainly, has been to decrease seat comfort and spaciousness, thanks to safety requirements and to cost cutting.

Cheaper, as I said, is the only concession I'll give here.

Cleaner — I guess that's a personal thing. I generally don't find our trains to be particularly unpleasant, but there are, of course, always exceptions. Some trains have short turnaround times and so, whatever happens, are just going to have litter all over the place.

Which leads me onto my main gripe about trains in Europe. The frequency. Our frequencies are MUCH higher than most lines in Europe. And I completely disagree that our speeds are slower — true, there are more dedicated high-speed lines, which we don't have. Even these are usually not much faster than ours — often you'll see ""high speed"" lines with speed restrictions of around 125mph, which is the same as the speed of many of our conventional trains!

There are some areas that HAVE had lots of investment, mostly major routes between cities on conventional railways have had bypasses built and such things. But we have negated this issue by having large amounts of four-track railway and tilting trains for more winding routes. There wouldn't really be much point in building bypasses — and besides, the NIMBYs would be up in arms. The main issue now is the growing congestion that will mean future investment being required — which is exactly what HS2 is providing.",null,0,null,1429829836,null,0,false,0,cqmjnmk,null,t3_33li6n,null,t1_cqmjnmk,null,t1_cqmix8r,null,null,null,1432566771,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

 On that basis they'll no doubt be in cup final mode, us being one of the games they need to win to stay up. However as long as whichever wingers we play do their defensive work the wingback threat Hull pose should be nullified and we can hit them on the counter. As for that I'd like to see Souare in with Bolasie on the left, their combination play looks fancy and the overlapping runs Pape makes will give him a good opportunity to get a good cross in for Murray. 

On the other side, I'd also like to see Chung Yong Lee* start in for Wilf, show us what he can do. Even if his defensive side isn't as strong Hull aren't a team I think will threaten Ward too much with Dann helping to double up when that wing gets overloaded.

The law forces you to promote an abomination; a detestable sin (Leviticus 18:22) which is shameful, unnatural, lustful, and indecent (Romans 1:26-27). You would honestly think God wouldn't mind? Promoting and aiding a peoples whose marriage agenda would be a sin. (First Corinthians 6:9) is completely fine in the eyes of God? 

You honestly believe Christians have no legitimate objection to this?

I like Rodgers and I want him to succeed at this club. He's a very good coach and hes a miracle worker when it comes to some players, but he is by no means a good manager. His interviews are goddamn terrible (""I thought Gerrard was excellent against Aston Villa"" bullshit). He constantly tinkers with the formation hoping something comes good, then doesn't know what to do when he gets found out. He does terribly outside of the Premier League. We took a massive step last season, a much bigger step than we were supposed to take, but this season (unless we get the CL, slim chance) we have taken 2 steps back. A trophy would have changed that, but not happening. Those of you saying ""Oh Rodgers got us to two semi finals"", well, I'll be sure to tell my friends in 10 years time how well we did this season. 

Money is going to be a massive problem. I don't know why people are saying that it's not. We spent over 100 million in the summer. We're going to have problems and our funds will be limited this coming summer because of our failure to do well in most competitions we've been in. 

I do have qualms about giving Rodgers more time, but I'm not totally against him staying past the summer. My only concern is that if he flops again, we will not have a better option that Rodgers. Jurgen Klopp is a proven manager available in the summer, De Boer will also be available. I rate both higher than Rodgers. I know there is the Benitez love going around but I don't think the past is an answer to the future. We will not have a better opportunity, in my opinion, to replace Rodgers come the end of next season if replacement is needed.

&gt;An __automated external defibrillator (AED)__ is a [portable](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/portable) [electronic device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_device) that automatically diagnoses the life-threatening [cardiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac) [arrhythmias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhythmia) of [ventricular fibrillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_fibrillation) and [ventricular tachycardia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_tachycardia) in a [patient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient),  and is able to treat them through [defibrillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defibrillation), the application of electrical therapy which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the heart to reestablish an effective rhythm.

&gt;With simple audio and visual commands, AEDs are designed to be simple to use for the [layperson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layperson), and the use of AEDs is taught in many [first aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid), [certified first responder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_first_responder), and [basic life support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_life_support) (BLS) level [cardiopulmonary resuscitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation) (CPR) classes.

null,false,3luk3r,lfc12,,null,"I'm not disputing Klopps credentials by any means. A great manager, and in different circumstances, I'd take him with open arms.

What I'm trying to say, is that in my opinion, he's no better than what we've already got. Especially when you consider that Rodgers has begun to structure the team that he wants, one that he believes fits his style of play, one that he thinks is the set of players who can build a great future for the club.

What if Klopps visions are completely different? We'd just be another season behind and however million down as he restructured the team to his liking. 

Anyway, at the moment, I don't think that any manager could come to Liverpool and put in a decent attempt at the Premier League or Champions League in the first season, which is what it seems everybody calling for Brendan's head wants. Of course everybody wants to see us restored to our former glory, but we have to stop living 20 years in the past. Somebody else posted about it a few days ago, and they were right; we are not one of the best teams in the world anymore. People might not like to hear it, but it's true. Because of that, we have to stop judging Rodgers like we are the elite squad we once were. Hiring a manager who has shown unbelievable talent and potential, then firing him after a dodgy season, one that we all knew wasn't going to be great is ludicrous. 

It's beginning to sound like a broken record, but Rodgers is a manager for the future. In the case of Liverpool FC, there are no short term fixes unfortunately. Last season we were let down by our abhorrent defence and embarrassing squad depth whilst being carried by 3, arguably 4 players. That's not a sustainable policy, but keeping a manager who's showing potential and a structured plan is. 

To be honest, next season might not be all that great for Rogers either, but as long as he's showing a clear and realistic plan to get us back to the top, then I think he's the best man for the job.",null,0,null,1429833024,null,0,false,0,cqmlfry,null,t3_33lyil,null,t1_cqmlfry,null,t1_cqmkr93,null,null,null,1432567681,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

Our transfer strategies are abysmal, if we even employ any. Though the only thing 'decent' about the transfer committee, in BR's favour, is it dilutes the blame placed on him over transfers.

My thoughts would be to dissolve the committee and have BR in full control, give him the backing in market to sign who he wants without interference from a so called committee, then at least if he gets it wrong - the sole blame lays with him. And a sacking is fully justified.

Anyway we've gone way off on a tangent here, but what I will say and I know you don't agree is give BR more time.

The real indicator for how close we are to another Independence referendum will be where the SNP find themselves in the near future.

Uch

&gt;I didn't say...

No. But you need to when discussing things like this otherwise it's going to be presumed. 

You think we'd be less annoyed about missing out on top 4 because we had a different manager? No we wouldn't. I wouldn't. Rodgers got us into the top four, and competing for the title in his second season, so that's what Klopp would be judged on. I don't care if you lay that season at the feet of Suarez, if Klopp didn't qualify and mount a title challenge it would be a step down. He'd have a good squad too, something Rodgers certainly didn't have in his first season. So if Klopp came and didn't get top 4 it would be worse in fact. 

Can I suggest any managerial candidates? No. But thankfully that's not my job. We scout managers the same as we scout players. There will be plenty of up and coming managers that are causing a stir among professionals that we're unaware of. And like I've already said, a year is a long fucking time in football. By next summer there'll be a new star somewhere. There always is. Last summer it was Simeone. 

Klopp has already proven he can do what Rodgers is trying to do? Really? They are very different managers. Klopp is all about efficiency, energy, and the fast counter. He won back to back Bundesligas from 2010-12 because nobody in the division were prepared for the high press and athleticism of Dortmund. You don't need to sing Klopp's praises to me. I hate to be that guy (no I don't, I love it) but I was following Dortmund ""before it was cool."" His past two seasons haven't been anything to write home about though. 

His period of success came when the Bundesliga was one of the least competitive leagues in Europe. I know you probably already know that. It doesn't take away from his accomplishment because they were phenomenal for those few seasons, and any club finishing above Munich deserves the title. However as the competitiveness of the league increased, Dortmund's record went the other way, and it's not a coincidence. I wonder how Klopp would cope in the most competitive league in the world? 

And your final question. How long can we wait for Rodgers? I think everyone, including almost definitely the owners, know he has one season left to get things right, otherwise he goes. That's undeniably been the common consensus among the majority of supporters. It's being fair to everyone.",null,0,null,1429837073,null,0,false,0,cqmnpo6,null,t3_33lyil,null,t1_cqmnpo6,null,t1_cqmdm5n,null,null,null,1432568752,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

To be clear, the issue I'm trying to address is that of the malevolent owner that use football clubs as their play things. I think this is a problem for football clubs across the world (Parma are the latest victims) and that there should be some mechanism of protecting football clubs from them for the benefit of the communities around the club.  I'm not presenting a solution or anything, I'm just brainstorming ideas which is why I wrote ""I wonder if it would be feasible"".

&gt; Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but would your idea about banning those that have been involved in previous financial mismanagement of a club not mean that Paul Murray and Dave King would have been banned from their recent takeover

Let me get my thoughts on this out the way first...

If they were deemed to be responsible then yes, they should banned. However, I don't think that is the case since they were both dissenting voices during Craig Whyte's tenure.  Dave King in particular was in dialogue with the SFA and the police, passing information to them that he could only obtain whilst remaining on the board. In the near future, I expect that both of them will appear as witnesses in the prosecution of Craig Whyte when the proceedings against him progress. So whilst Dave King in particular has to prove himself fit and proper, I don't believe remaining on the Board at Rangers will be a factor that will count against them.  His personal tax affairs are far more relevant.

Regarding the points deduction for debt default

&gt; Firstly, this opens the door for a club to spend beyond their means, accumulate a points total which puts them out of reach of other clubs, dump the debts and win trophies they haven't paid for.

So currently we have a system where if the owner takes the club into administration, they are basically saying to their creditors, ""Hey, I can't pay my bills, would you accept X% instead?."" If the creditors agree, you get off with not paying a portion of your bill. Then yes, this has to be punished for the reasons you state, and a sporting punishment is fitting. I agree.

What I'm suggesting is a mechanism to allow communities with the club at heart to step in and if they meet certain conditions then ownership can be transferred to them with no sporting penalty. I think these conditions would have to include **settling 100% all debts**. So basically, the owners couldn't pay the debt so the fans of the club do.  No debts are shed, and since the funds could have been injected into the club by the fans anyway then the argument that they were living beyond their means doesn't hold here.  The success of this depends on the fans being able to pay off all debts. If the owner has gone on a spending spree and the fans cannot raise the money, then the standard punishments should apply.

**Now let me argue why I think fans should be given an opportunity to put things right.**

What if there is a bad owner and fans for whatever reason do not want to put money into the club whilst they are in charge. As things stand, the bad owner can effectively hold a gun to the club's head and say ""If you don't buy season tickets etc, I'll let the club go bust"".  The fans are either emotionally blackmailed to fund the club or the club enters administration points are deducted etc. The bad owner walks away, the fans are left to pick up the pieces.

Another situation which is quite commons is if a new owner takes over a club with a leveraged buy out i.e. they buy the club with a loan. They can then shift the debt from themselves onto the club. So what if they run the club within their means, but due to external factors, the owners credit facilities are removed. The club can default on this debt whilst still living within its means. Is a sporting penalty fair then?

Basically, I'm concerned that some decisions have been taken in light of the Rangers saga that I don't feel are in the best interests of football and its communities.  Personally, I don't think football clubs should be allowed to be traditional companies and we should at least try and move away from this structure. I think something like a Community Interest Company (CIC), with an FA recognised fan membership scheme would be more appropriate and healthier for the game. 

My ""proposal"" would effectively be a mechanism for clubs to move towards this structure. Weed out bad owners whilst empowering communities to take control of their clubs.

I'm not saying that shaming doesn't work for some people but the psyches of people very so widely and reactions to shaming would mirror that. 

Two things bother me about fat shaming in Western culture. One is that there's a lot of focus on the shaming part and very little on what you can do to fix things. A lot of calls here to display ads showing the grave aspects of obesity. OK, but where is the hope? The one-two punch of that is showing why the alternative is better in every way and how people can achieve it. 

The other problem is the demonisation of obesity vs all of our other societal ills. We're still drinking way too much, we're all still becoming ever more disconnected, that there is a huge energy crash looming, we're ignoring massive human rights abuses around the world, poverty and drug addiction nearer to home. Yeah obesity is a problem but I swear I see so many people get hysterical over it to the point of ignoring everything else. There are lots of problems in the world, lots of good too, but there probably is no God or afterlife so when we start taking everything too seriously, let's just take a breather and remember to not to be so judgemental.

Homophobia is not a major problem any more, I think it would be fair to say. There are now prominent gay people in politics, the media and business, schools are taking action against it and in polite society it's highly stigmatised.

But that is only somewhat pertinent to the argument about hate speech, which was criminalised because people felt it encouraged actual acts of violence. This may well be true, though it is impossible to link most instances of speech to the violence, which implies an obtuse definition of criminal responsibility. 

To put it another way: If a man says “poof” in Wembley should he be considered complicit in a homophobic murder in Hull? I doubt it, myself.

Yes, a boy might not like her because she is fat, but that doesn't then give him (or anyone) the right to bully and harass her. 

There's a difference between thinking being fat is unhealthy and wrong to outright abusing people who are fat.

**The whole transfer argument is bullshit.** It's not the fact that he wasted the money he was given [from the look of things you can tell that Lovren and Lallana were the only BR only signings], he had to build a squad before he could build a team. There are so many factors involved in transfers its silly to blame him. Not to mention the high failure rate of transfers anyway, **50% success is considered to be great!**

He says that hes achieved nothing in the 3 seasons? **Is he an idiot.** Liverpool has gone under the biggest transformation in the last 5 years out of any of the PL clubs. BR has got us back into challenging for top 4 and once again being considered a club worthy of our history. The only ***real*** point [that I feel is valid] for BR to go is that he has, for now, done all he can with what hes had. It's time for Klopp to come so that we can 'show the market our intention'. Top players now is what we need to really propel ourselves forward and top players ***usually*** go to where managers are highly respected, where unfortunately BR outside of PL is not ***yet***

If we cannot get Klopp then we should definitely stick with Rodgers, here is no-one else available who would work with out club. Koeman is not as well known as Klopp and I fear doesnt have the same charismatic edge to lure top players. Ancelotti will never be brought in, completely wrong club-manager fit and he wont be able to work with our budget. Pep - are you dreaming? De Boer faces same problem as Koeman. If there is not a worthy replacement then Rodgers has done enough [compared with alternatives] to deserve more time.

null,false,Jaraxo,eng-lincolnshire,Grimsby Area,null,"Yeh. I think I used [this](http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/persian-lamb-tagine) BBC recipe, as they're usually very simple to follow.

It calls for garlic, cumin, coriander, chilli, turmeric, saffron, cinnamon and lemon.

I had everything but the saffron already in the kitchen and refused to pay the price for saffron so left that out anyway. I also didn't use the rosewater or cornflower as I didn't think they were necessary.

A few things I'd recommend if you do use this recipe though:

* You'll need quite a large dish to get all this in, so you might want to scale it down a bit. I did just over 1kg of lamb shoulder and adjusted the spice measurements appropriately, and that was enough to fill 3 adults with a generous serving of couscous.

* I also personally would scale back the Apricots. I used about 150g (didn't weigh them, just used roughly 1.5 100g packets) but they are **very** sweet. Perhaps cut them down to only a few pieces of apricot per person depending on how much you like apricot.

* I personally preferred the dates to the apricots and would add more next time, definitely prioritising them over apricots. The flavour is more subtle and goes well with the lamb.

* Make sure to get some good quality strong flavoured pistachios. Mine turned out okay, but ultimately were soft and lacklustre offering little flavouring. They lose a lot of flavour to the dish in cooking. I think mine lost flavour as rather than being added 30mins before the end as the recipe calls for, I added them several hours before the end as I majorly changed the cooking times, as outlined in the point below. Next time I'll remember to add them right towards the end.

* I cut the temperature (Gas 2 (down to Gas 1 towards the end) as opposed to gas 4) and adjusted the cook time for a proper slow cook, almost 4 hours in total. This way the lamb falls apart rather than simply being regular stewed lamb. Though anyone who has slow cooked meat before knows how to do this.",null,0,null,1429846149,null,0,1429846502,0,cqmswcr,null,t3_33md9s,null,t1_cqmswcr,null,t1_cqmpzn0,null,null,null,1432571268,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

It's different of course - food in general is not 'bad' for you in and of itself. You can eat a whole large pizza if you want, if the rest of your diet is balanced against it. Food also doesn't hurt others - there's no 'passive eating' to worry about.

Shaming as much as guidance about wearing seat belts, eh. 

&gt; It's different of course - food in general is not 'bad' for you in and of itself. You can eat a whole large pizza if you want, if the rest of your diet is balanced against it. 

This isn't what people mean when they say 'balanced diet'. It's not about balancing the good and the bad, it's about balancing all the nutrition you need so you get everything your body requires, and not more or less. If the pizza you're eating is junk food, it's unhealthy and doesn't belong in a balanced diet. 

&gt; Food also doesn't hurt others - there's no 'passive eating' to worry about. It can't be dealt with the same way, but at the same time we can't expect results if people are not confronted with the harsh reality.

You're right, but influence is a huge factor, and this is more subtle than passive smoking. How many fat parents do you see with fat kids?

IIRC in the 80s BR's rule of thumb was that for diesel trains if they had more than 5 carriages they should be loco-hauled, because the lifetime cost of the heavy and space-consuming loco was then less than the lifetime cost of several smaller engines. 

The reduced maximum axle load from DMUs rather than LHCS didn't help much if you were running freight on the lines. Sprinterisation helped largely because freight traffic was low and declining on most of the provincial routes (and because passenger train lengths were shortened), but that's lead to the problems caused by the very favourable deal EWS got from Railtrack.

More reliable engines have shifted the balance slightly in favour of DMUs, but the stricter emissions standards might shift the balance back.

As the article says its mostly popular in the gay scene of large cities and isn't particularly cheap.

My guess is that the people who would be involved in such things are already involved in amphetamine sulphate production anyway which is cheap and widely available, meth has been a problem in the US, Australia, NZ for a couple of decades now and is well known in the UK but my guess is a strong demand for another basic stimulant, however potent, just isn't there.

The UK - and I'm guessing by extension a lot of the EU - also has long had tighter controls on the simple precursor for manufacturing methamphetamine, psuedoephedrine, than existed in other countries.  It's available but securing the large quantities that allowed meth labs to pop up all over the other countries isn't quite as simple here and adds another level of risk and difficulty.  

We might just be a bit late to the party on this one however and if the cartels that are bringing in the huge quantities of cocaine to satisfy the ever growing UK demand decide to start focusing on bringing in Mexican/US meth then we might be in trouble because it's cheap and the manufacturing capacity is well established over there.

You have far to many posts for me to do this and not be bored at the end of it xD

But I know a couple of things.

You are a relatively fit person and judging by your comments I'd say you are male. If you aren't fit your job is to tell other people to get fit as you browse the /r/fitness and /r/bodybuilding subreddits a lot.

You are someone who wants the internet to be free and not controled by the government. You are also Pro-Snowdon.

You are a fan of the fallout series and conspiracy theroies and actually believe in some.

If you ask me your looking for a white male 21-30 Goes to the Gym but also plays video games in his spare time and talks to friends/family about keeping fit and exercise routines. Infact I'd say you want it to be your job as a coach of fitness instructor.

You also say Scotch, But not Whisky. Usually people in Scotland tend to just say Whisky because thats what it is to them.  So I'd say you are from England but somewhere near the border of Scotland. In the north of England most likely.


Infact. I found the post.

&gt;27 year old working class englishman, remotes controls often came with a long wire, or were non existent.

so you are 27 maybe 28 now after 6 months since that post. And you work in Construction which is cool because of your passion of keeping fit which you need to be for that job.

&gt;..but that means leaving the house and talking to people.


You like to joke about Social Anxiety but Like me you most likely would prefer to go to a gym or play video games than sit about doing little to nothing.

You also browse /r/Flipping 
could you be taking things that you find from construction sites to sell? Let's say you are demolishing a house and you find some things in it which could be worth something..

Fuck. I could go on and on but I have limited time and am doing this while in work.

After initially feeling urgh after Fridaying early, sort of. I whacked my head on a door handle yesterday at fuckouch speed, and it's hurting today. Despite much Hoegaarden I don't have a proper hangover though, mainly blocked sinuses. In fact I haven't had a real hangover since quitting the fags, which is a great unexpected bonus.

&gt;What does the weekend bring you

Moar Hoegaarden!

I will attempt to get worldwide 3rd place in a film quiz. I'm no 1 in the UK and 5 globally, but need another 229,000 points to get to third place. Obviously I'd prefer first place but that dude is over a million ahead of me, so I have to be satisfied with beating him now and then instead. 

I also have to go balloon shopping for the dog. Bursting them is his new favourite thing, and it's adorable to watch. I'm also going to spoil them and make them ostrich burgers for lunch.

However in practise a typical baby-sitter simply doesn't make enough money for any tax to be due.  

There are 2 important limits.  You have a personal tax allowance, £10,600 for the current tax year (which runs from 6th April).  If all your taxable income for the year is less than that, you do not have to pay any income tax.  

Separately there is also National Insurance which is effectively a second form of income tax.  There are several ""classes"" of National Insurance - for a self-employed person the ones we care about are classes 2 and 4.  If you make less than £5,965 this tax year no Class 2 is payable.  If you make less than £8,060 you pay Class 2 only. £8,060 or more and you pay both 2 &amp; 4.

2) No. In the UK gifts are not taxable at the time they're received.  In rare cases you may have to pay inheritance tax if the gift is significant and the person who gave it to you dies within 7 years.

Check the helmet the casualty's wearing first. If it's a full-face helmet, and you absolutely must, then remove the helmet as described - small rocking motions with another person stabilising the neck.

However if the helmet is a systems or modular helmet, you needn't remove the helmet in the first instance. You can usually assess breathing and perform CPR on a casualty if you lift the faceplate of the helmet away, minimising the potential for moving the casualty and causing further, or aggravating existing, injuries. If the faceplate is in the way or obstructing lifesaving techniques then remove the helmet as described.

Bear in mind systems helmets are much easier to remove with the faceplate is in the upright position, or at least isn't locked into the main body of the helmet.

Also, before taking a helmet off of a casualty examine the lower part of the helmet for any red tabs sticking out from between the cheek-pads, and the inner shell of the helmet. If present, these tabs are designed to allow you to more easily detach and remove the cheek-pads from the inside of the helmet, making it easier to remove a helmet from a casualty.

If they're not present, assess whether you can safely remove the cheek-pads anyway to help make removing the helmet a little easier. But don't delay performing lifesaving techniques when they are needed, in lieu of making removal of the helmet easier.

And NEVER, in the name of whatever you hold dear, move a casualties neck - or allow a casualty to move their neck - if you even remotely **suspect** that they **might** have a neck injury.",null,0,null,1429864967,null,0,false,0,cqmzkz7,null,t3_33mji9,null,t1_cqmzkz7,null,t3_33mji9,null,null,null,1432574487,null,5,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,5,null

null,false,docmuppet,eng-sussex,(near) Brighton,null,"First thing, liberalism and left wing are not the same thing, in fact the liberal democrats are more liberal than both the conservatives and labour but all three lean (to varying degrees) to right of centre. 

There has also been research that suggests that most ""intelligent"" people (although its very difficult to measure this) are centre right, the hypothesis being that intelligent people are more ""fluid"" in their beliefs. They will vote for the party they feel represents their views best rather than adhering to a strict party loyalty or a right/left wing stance. This is also the reason extremists tend to be (although not all) pretty stupid people. 

Also your statistics are misleading and don't actually support your viewpoint. In the US both major parties, the Democrats are perceived to be left wing but that perception only arises when comparing them to the further right Republicans. The Democrats are a centre right party most similar to the UK Conservatives. Thus many of the Professors who answered Liberal are most likely Democrat voters and therefore support a centre *right* party.

You also invalidate your own argument with this phrase: 
&gt; those on the right wing with exceptional intelligence might be more attracted to the higher-paying private sector anyway


Which points out that the studies you mentioned are flawed for your purposes as they only ask a specific subset of intelligent people. This is fine if you want to suggest that American professors are more liberal (note I said liberal, not left wing) but not ok if you're using the result to say intelligence correlates with political stance.

Get a gentle cleanser and carry it with you so you use one product consistently: people here like Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Wash (not the other variants) or Boots Simply Sensitive wash. Try washing your face at the gym as soon as you finish the workout, also use it at your girlfriends. Get that down before introducing other products, you don't want to worsen anything with a full new routine.

Once you have been doing that for a couple of weeks, then next step would be sunscreen (see article in sidebar) or a chemical exfoliant (see mega review in sidebar).

Note that sunscreen MUST be introduced before the exfoliant if you go for an AHA like glycolic acid. This is photosensitising (increases sun damage). BHA would more likely be suitable tho and this does not mean any extra sun precautions over the recommended.

If not change after a couple of weeks of a chemical exfoliant consult your family doctor - they can prescribe all sorts for acne (some of which are photosensitising so again sunscreen may need to be in place first).

I've read the literature, and I do understand the advantages of legalization, and actually in the past I used to be pro-decriminalisation at least, but over a few years my viewpoint changed. 

It was simply the amount of damage that drugs have done to the lives of myself and members of my friends and family. For example my ex who I was living with in another country at the time became so paranoid when he was smoking weed everyday that he threatened to kill himself, smashed up all my things in rages, accused me of things, just made life for us hell until his family finally stepped in and he stopped. One family member stepped on a used needle hidden in bushes at work which led to a series of hospital tests and tonnes of stress and worry for a good few months. My best friend's dad is too high all the time to even notice that he has a son, my dads been the victim of theft from a friend needing drug money....

After all that shit plus more it just got to a point where I just don't like the idea of drugs and would rather not see them promoted or more widespread in society. It's a personal thing so while I'm not going to be out marching in any kind of anti-drugs rally anytime soon, I would discreetly mark no if it came to a vote. Sorry.

null,false,semajjames,null,null,null,"&gt;We had some very good players at Manchester City when I arrived in January 2009, but we were inconsistent.
I saw what the problem was straight away - it was Robinho and the midfielder Elano and a centre-back called Glauber, who ended up only playing once for City.
They had formed a Brazilian clique and, as far as I could see, they didn’t give a shit.
They didn’t train with any intensity and if you tackled one of them, it was like you had committed a crime.
In the February, we played Portsmouth at Fratton Park. We lost 2-0. Robinho and Elano were a disgrace.
I’d only been there a couple of weeks but I’d had enough of them.
After the game, I had a real go at both of them.
When I got to training on Monday, Robinho called me over.
Elano was standing behind him. Just like he always did.
“Why you talk?” Robinho said.
“Do you think I’m out of order then, yeah?” I said. “I gather you do.”
“I play for Brazil,” Elano said. “I play in the first team. I come here to Manchester City and I don’t play all the time. How do you think I feel?”
“That’s not my fucking problem,” I said. “You had your chance on Saturday. And look how you played.”
“You never had a bad game?” Elano said.
“It wasn’t that you had a bad game,” I told him. “It was just the lack of effort. You weren’t interested. That hurts more.”
“You always talk,” Robinho said. “It should be the manager who talks, not you.”
“If I’ve got something to say, I’ll fucking say it,” I said.
“Okay,” Robinho said, trying to bring the conversation to an end, “don’t talk to me again.”
“What are you on about?” I said. “You mean talk to you as in talking to you at all or talk to you after the game?”
“No, no, we are finished,” he said.
Whatever,” I said. “I’ll lose a lot of sleep over that.”

Ultimately, HSBC would be stupid not to move back to Hong Kong. This will cost thousands of British Jobs directly and thousands more indirectly. It will also means British politicians study the laffer curve and the effect high taxes have when we live in a flexible and globalised world.

Both 'liberalism' and 'left-wing' are extremely badly defined though (there is no one belief that makes you 'left-wing'), which means that any definition I do use could be attacked for being non-representative. If you can give me a definition of being 'left-wing' which both suits you and has good data attached to it I can go looking for an answer which will satisfy you, but otherwise I think self-identification is probably the most reliable measure.

I feel like your third paragraph is an unreasonable attempt to invalidate the data. Professors weren't asked 'who do you vote for', but asked about their political position. They may vote Democrat because it is the least bad of the two options while holding political views to the left of the Dems. In the same way some people who like UKIP policies are going to vote Tory because they prefer Tory to Labour. It seems to me that in order for your argument to work you need professors to be clever enough to qualify as ""intellectuals"", but too stupid to tell the difference between, ""What are your political beliefs?"" and ""Which party do you vote for?"". It's hard for me to believe people could make that mistake unless you can link me specific evidence that people *do*.

I agree that the studies only look at a specific subset of intelligent people - it is the subset of intelligent people we typically mean when we say ""intellectuals"", the synonyms for which include (amongst others) ""academic, bookworm, bookish person, man of letters, woman of letters, bluestocking, thinker, scholar, sage"". That's substantially different from what we mean when we say, ""intelligent"", which is synonymous with (amongst other things), ""clever, bright, brilliant, sharp, quick, quick-witted"". If the OP had meant to refer to clever people generally, they'd have used ""intelligent people"". The context makes it clear the OP is talking more about people in the academic sphere too - he is talking about the sort of 'bookish' 'person of letters' who considers themselves enough of a 'thinker' to offer 'sage' advice to Comment is Free. Obviously those people also think of themselves as intelligent in the classic sense (smart, quick-witted etc), but while all intellectuals think of themselves as intelligent, not all intelligent people think of themselves as intellectuals (for example, most bankers and doctors I know don't think of themselves as intellectuals, but are extremely intelligent).

Pretty sure at some stages of history it was quite within the law to burn people for witch craft or attack jews. Fuck the law when it comes to morals.

Now I don't honestly know anything about this case, but what I do know, is that it's fucking hyperbolic to call a 15 year old a child and a few years ago you wouldn't be hearing 'grooming' or 'child' in relation to a case like this. She is at most 12 months off being legal, so I assume all of the 'it's the law' type people would be quite alright if a girl on her 16th birthday decided to get gang fucked by 10 dudes in their 40's, because well, arbitrary rules yeah?

I dunno what the deal is in this case, and I am not gonna say that he isn't a bit strange for going for a 15 year old when presumably he has his pick of women nearer his own age.. but , if it was all consensual and she is happy with what's gone on, then frankly I don't think this is that serious a crime.

Article:
&gt;In the end it was not postal voter fraud or intimidation that rendered the verdict guilty, though this previously had been the allegations most covered by the press

Judgement:
&gt;he court is therefore satisfied that agents of Mr Rahman were guilty of breaches of s 62A of the 1983 Act and thus of corrupt practices.

(Section 62A concerns postal fraud)
&gt;The Judge stated Rahman is guilty of bribery because he hired someone who had worked as a TV reporter to be his advisor

Actually he said that TV stations had been paid to run adverts for Rahman.  As TV stations aren't *allowed* to take money to run political adverts, this constituted bribery.  Also that the chief political correspondent of one channel was hired *using council money* to advise on media relations within the Bangladeshi community (but there was no general media relations advisor)
Article:
&gt;The most recent case law regarding ‘spiritual influence/injury’ is from 19th century Ireland courts not operating under home rule.

...but as the judge pointed out, the law has been renewed and revised several times since then and is not considered an archaic remnant.  Also, spiritual influence doesn't mean clerics saying ""I support this person"", it's clerics saying ""if you don't support this person, you aren't a real member of my religion"", or threatening to ex-communicate, or similar

Article:
&gt;No example of intimidation was given in court bar multiple campaigners congregating on pavements

One example given was of people banging on car windows.  Also, it had been agreed between all major parties that no more than two campaigners per candidate per polling station would be present, and they went back on that agreement.

Saints and Spurs are on such a similar level right now, it's both amazing (that we're on their level, we were about 10 - 15 points behind last season), and bad because we're both so inconsistent at present it's a pain and hard as hell to predict. We really need a win today, because we've been so mixed in our last few results, and not had a ""good"" win in a while.  

Also, we've lost every game against Tottenham since we got back in the PL. And the whole Poch thing, though I'm not as bothered by that.  

I'd really like to see at least two youngsters in our team, as Thesk says. Davis has been poor of late, I'd rather JWP, and Reed is such a machine in the middle that he breaks up play almost as much as Wanyama just by always being there, and I'd like to see both him and JWP get a start. That likely means Gallagher won't, but I'd be more than happy for him to start overall, what have we got to lose given our ailing attack for the last few months? Putting in someone like Gallagher wouldn't be the worst thing, he's possibly got more pace than Pelle, he's definitely on a high right now, and as proven he can strike a ball from outside the area, I've forgotten what that feels like this season! 

Toby will be back so hopefully we can just play a solid defense, and, we know Poch will have them pressing high and tiring etc; how about Mané and Elia on the wings, Long in the middle, and a counter tactic, with JWP sitting central/attacking mid and Reed/Schneiderlin behind him interrupting play etc, spreading the ball around too? That is what beat us so many times last season, and we can have the options to put a lot of pace in our squad, so why not try it? Palace are working wonders with it atm, and it's not like it wouldn't be working into our possible strengths.  

Overall I agree, draw would be acceptable, win would be good, loss unacceptable. Especially when it just turns out to be a scrappy 1 - 0 off an Erikssen free kick in the 80th minute again.  

Still.... 2 - 0. No idea on scorers, because no idea on team - but I'm calling it Mané and Fonte (from a corner).

The alternative was to allow Gaddaffi's henchmen to beat the revolution into submission. It's not a great option, but it's better than the one we went for. 

Gaddaffi was a social liberal, and would've died soon and passed the mantle to his social liberal sons. Eventually, internal presssures would lead to increasing democracy in a controlled way, like we did it in the UK.

Which is not true because there are lots of funny right wingers, the person in the link is just exceptionally poor at understanding what makes up a right wing comedian. It feels like 'envy', which is something that people across the political spectrum share, is being incorrectly attributed to left wingers. The idea that the 'other' person needs taking down a peg or two or mocked seems to be attached to left wing dialogue but in reality right wing dialogue is just as beady eyed and petty. The key difference being that it's much easier to highlight that rhetoric in right wing philosophy ""all for me, none for you"" than it is in left wing philosophy ""we are all equal but some are more equal than others"".

Comedy is all about timing and the subversion of expectations. Those on the left are more likely to enjoy and play with the absurdity of human interactions where as those on the right are more likely to point out the absurdity of sameness and homogenity. I'd say Michael Mcintyre and Russel Howard are a good examples of a right wing comedian despite their generally apolitical routines.

Has there been a time in our recent history of interventionism and imperialism where such appeals have actually resulted in the betterment of the place we invade? 

The fact is conflicts and humanitarian crises are complex and tricky things. The Syria situation is something the western media would like you to believe is simple and obvious; mean ol' Assad killing his own people with gas! The reality of it is much murkier. In that kind of situation where does our duty to help come in? Who are we helping? Why are we helping them? Will military intervention actually help, or will it just end up creating more enemies and extremists that will hate us in a region of the world that despises western imperialism already? 

If we have a duty to help absolutely everyone then how much is that going to cost? Even with coalitions doing this kind of work there is a finite amount of material resources that we have to work with, as well as a limit on how much money can be poured into these things. How can it all be paid for? A fucking cruise missle probably costs as much as a hospital in some of these countries. And then there's the big elephant in the room of our government pouring money into foreign conflicts and military expenditure (which can be seen as morally right or whatever) while there's still poverty and other issues at home which it isn't doing anything about.

My position is not one of isolationism or one borne from a lack of compassion. Saying ""sometimes we have a duty to help"" is way too simplistic and wishy-washy. What are those times?

Also one of my points was that Governments are only interested in intervening in conflicts like this for economic gain. The reason you see Libya, Syria and Iraq get focused on is because of oil reserves. Other conflicts in places like Africa will be ignored by our government because they have nothing to gain from it. It's horrible I know, but it's not going to change even if Milliband comes to power.

Of course they often go hand in hand but a communist regime is extreme left wing fiscally but extreme authoritarians as well so the two need to kept separate to better describe such situations. 

My third paragraph was simplified, that said If a person is wildly different from the democrats they probably aren't going to vote for them, maybe an independent or they could spoil their ballot. I'm not suggesting that *all* liberals vote democrat, merely suggesting that its extremely likely and even if you don't entirely agree with your chosen party they are still likely to be close to your own beliefs. To use your example people who like UKIP but for some unknown reason wont vote for them would vote for conservatives because they have many similar policies, they are similar to their beliefs ergo a liberal would vote democrat because they best represent their beliefs.

What the evidence warrants is ""Some Muslim men are paedophiles"", not ""Muslims are paedophiles"". The former assertion is considerably more limited in scope, and far less open to misinterpretation, than the latter. The same goes for ""Some Pakistani men are paedophiles"" and ""Some British men are paedophiles"". If, from the statement ""Some Muslim men are paedophiles"" you're going to draw the conclusion ""so there's a problem with Muslims"" then you'll also need to draw the same conclusion about the British because it's the same logic at work with both extrapolations.  

What the problem actually is, is paedophiles, i.e. not a paedophile's religious faith, nor their nationality, nor their heritage, but their behaviour. You might argue that their heritage influences their behaviour, and this is undoubtedly true, but that can't be the entire story because other people with the exact same heritage manage to go about their lives without being paedophiles.

So: As there are both British paedophiles and Pakistani paedophiles, and as there are both Christian and Muslim paedophiles, paedophilia isn't limited to being a British, Pakistani, Christian or Muslim problem.

Constantly harping on that someone's a Pakistani or Muslim paedophile is getting quite close to a ""collective guilt"" (tarring everyone with the same brush) fallacy: Because a number of people who share characteristic X have been found guilty of behaviour Y then all people sharing characteristic X have behaviour Y. Some Irish people are terrorists therefore all Irish people are terrorists, all black people are criminals, all Jews are grasping ... you see where this line of argument goes.

So sure, some Pakistani Muslim men have been convicted of being paedophiles, but the first two attributes aren't the problem here, whereas the third is.",null,0,null,1429869959,null,0,false,0,cqn0p1t,null,t3_33mrx8,null,t1_cqn0p1t,null,t1_cqn09xe,null,null,null,1432575011,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

I understand it is one of those things that we sort of know what it looks like when we see it, but if you have a test that includes all left-wing people and excludes all non left-wing people I would literally saw off my arm to get at it, because it would solve huge problems the left today has. I guess what I'm asking for is: if you have an algorithm that lets me put in a policy and the algorithm says, ""Yes, this is left wing"" or ""No, this is not left wing"" I will stand for MP next election because I cannot possibly lose, and I will make sure you get the credit for my victory.

I don't fully understand your second paragraph - it seems like you actually agree with me. The question in most of these tests was, ""Which of these positions do you agree with more: extreme left, center left, moderate, center right or extreme right?"". It doesn't matter which way Professors vote, because they are (mostly) identifying as center left. I guess I don't care very much either way because if you don't believe OP was actually talking about intellectuals (they were rather talking about 'intelligent people') then Professors are a biased subset of all intelligent people.

I guess I don't disagree that OP could be trying a bait-and-switch - get someone like me to argue that 'intellectuals' seems to be a left-wing phenomenon and hope that nobody notices that 'intellectual' is not the same as 'intelligence', but to be fair you do your side no favours if that's what you mean - when you reply, ""That just isn't true."" you leave it very ambiguous as to whether you mean that it isn't true that most intellectuals are left-wing (which I think is false - most intellectuals are left-wing) or it isn't true that most intelligent people are left-wing, and you believe that OP is trying the bait-and-switch I outlined above.

That specific situation being a white guy using a racial slur to refer to a non-white guy. Not really all that specific.

Given the unspoken rule that you can't choose your own nickname, somehow I doubt the guy was 100% behind it. Even if he was, I followed the links to one of the original articles and it claims that Prince Harry was filmed calling a second man a ""Raghead."" Now, this is just me being a Skeptical Steven right here but somehow I doubt that you can go two for two with racist ""nicknames"" like those.

&gt;I didn't respond to your comment on the tube scenario because I don't know the details of the repercussions for the guy.

Then let me educate you.  
  
[This](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/11465363/Chelsea-news-Five-to-appear-in-court-over-Paris-racist-abuse.html) is one of the first articles to appear regarding the incident. Chelsea fans on the way back from a game in Paris chant racist horseshit and abuse a black guy. 

Then there was [this](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/21/chelsea-fans-who-shouted-racist-chants-at-london-station-sought-by-police) as a follow-up. Police begin to identify and seek out those filmed, because those filmed aren't hiding in a group of thousands of people anymore.

Then there was [this](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/chelsea-fan-josh-parsons-filmed-5195724) one of the fans was identified as a City Trader and was suspended by his employers pending police investigation.

But no I'm sure Prince Harry got the worst of it or something.

&gt;And I'm hardly going to say, ""ok, just called a guy at work a 'black cunt' and he broke my jaw. I guess you were right all along!""

Stop deliberately missing the point. You know as well as I do that if you were openly racist to someone at your workplace then a broken jaw could be the least of your problems, some companies would just straight-up fire your ass, and that would be that, because no company wants that shit on their record.

null,false,sometimesihelp,null,null,null,"1) Babysitting would be classed as providing a service for a profit and therefore classify the babysitter as self-employed (which requires registration) with a self-assessment due. That said unless the occasional babysitting is much more lucrative than I imagine or you have another job then it is unlikely any tax would be due (see /u/IxionS3's post for thresholds/numbers). Then again I'm not aware of HMRC chasing someone who is an occasional babysitter for failing to register as self-employed. An exception to this might be if someone is on benefits.

2) See /u/IxionS3's post, there isn't much more to add here.

3) With regards to #3 there are some rules set out by HMRC as to whether you have to pay tax on hobbies. Simply put: Trading =&gt; Self-Employed =&gt; Self-Assessment due =&gt; Pay tax on income above thresholds (as we saw with babysitting). Importantly the case you laid out would not classify as trading and therefore not self-employment. No self-assessment would be required and no additional tax would be due to be paid. 

[This HMRC page](https://www.gov.uk/working-for-yourself/what-counts-as-self-employed) stipulates that ""you are probably not trading if ... you don’t plan to make a profit"". Then there is also this [HMRC link](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/guidance/selling/examples.htm) which gives examples of what is, and what is not, classed as trading. Example 1 is the most relevant and I have paraphrased it below but it is worth reading the HMRC page itself to get a true idea of what the example is: 

&gt;Occasionally selling goods made by what is usually a hobby to friends/family/colleagues for an amount that just covers the materials lack commerciality as long as there was no intention to make a profit. These sales to friends/family/colleagues are not classed as trading - it is a by-product of a hobby and therefore not liable for VAT.",null,0,null,1429871556,null,0,1429871741,0,cqn12r5,null,t3_33ofrl,null,t1_cqn12r5,null,t3_33ofrl,null,null,null,1432575191,null,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

My own take on it is that it is broken window fallacy in action. 

A broken window is good for the window repair man, however bad for the person paying to fix the window and all of the individual shop keepers he would have otherwise spent the money on. Therefore had the window not been broken the money could have been spent productively elsewhere. Maybe the person who owned the window would invest it, maybe they'd go to the pub or whatever we can't know. 

The bank is essentially the window breaker in the form of interest. Even if you don't borrow an interest element is reflected in the price of all goods you buy meaning everything is more expensive. Same thing with mortgages. A person who is mortgage free at 35 has a lot more disposable than somebody with a mortgage or renting.

Which goes back to the window breaking. The system as it stands regularly breaks your window and it is the window repair man. If you stopped getting your window broken daily and stopped having to pay for repairs it would mean a whole load more cash in your pocket.

And so we do something, because our conscience doesn't allow us to sit back and do nothing.

But in reality I think that the best option would be to do nothing and to watch Benghazi burn. Horrible to do at the time, but in the long run it results in less death, destruction, and oppression, and holds out greater prospects for eventually achieving democracy and freedom.

Markovic is a winger so he's not being played out of position, he's just being asked to do extra work in the defensive area which he's still learning.  

Sterling can arguably play anywhere in the top 3 and has done several times in the past. His time has arguably been split pretty evenly between being the central forward and being on the left and he's performed in each. Don't see any problem.  

Coutinho can play as the top forward in a false 9, sit in the hole behind a striker or sit slightly further back in front of Lucas and Allen or Hendo. No problem there, that's what he's been doing.

The issues in Libya are about more than just a the fact that Gadaffi was a bad man and we should've gone in harder after he was toppled.  The issues in Libya are complex and interconnected, and until you get a grip on what's going on, any intervention could easily make things worse.

For starters, the Libyan population has doubled since 1980.  There's a lot of young people there, many of whom are angry and without anywhere to go.  Combined with the food price spike around 2009, a massive drought in the region (which may or may not be related to climate change) led to a [peak and collapse in grain production](http://www.sacota.co.za/downloads/elfagehia.pdf).  The drought served to push lots of nomadic farmers into the cities to try and find food and work, which obviously generated conflict.  The drought there was [pretty significant](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/155471/2/2_Al-Riffai.pdf).  Over exploitation of groundwater is another signfiicant problem, made worse by population growth, and meaning that droughts probably hit harder.  Combine this with tribal groups who hate one anothers guts and it's a hell of a party.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt;Rodgers favours versatile players who can play in various positions  

Seems like you just picked the things you wanted to read out of what I said..  

Versatility means that players can operate well in different positions. Coutinho **can** play false 9 just as he can play further back or on the left. He's shown that he can perform well there this season just as he proved last season that he can play slightly further back.  

As I also said, Markovic is only 21. He's learning how to play in a different position. What other position would he fill in the team? Maybe he will play a different position next season but as a player and a fan you can't expect everyone to play in their exact position week in week out. Especially in a team like Rodgers who, as I've 
said, favours versatility. Also his position on the RW is the easiest to substitute when Rodgers wants to change things, that's why he seems to be substituted so often - it's not all to do with his performance. Either he comes off for a forward player, Moreno goes to LB and Can to RB and we play 4 at the back or he comes off, Johnson comes on and Can moves into the midfield. That's what happens, it's conducive to a versatile strategy.  

I'd say that Rodgers found the formation when we went on an unbeaten run of what? 13 games? Something like that.. realistically, we don't have the players to move Can out of defence, we don't have a 30 goal a season striker so that Sterling can play on the left.. I don't know what you want? Last season we played 4 at the back, had Luis Suarez and Sturridge firing on all cylinders and the rest of the team pretty much formed itself around them. This season it's not so simple and fans just have to have some fucking patience.

For example he made a joke about 'when are white people supposed to stop feeling guilty', and the audience was pretty hesitant to laugh, even though his wife is black. It's so ingrained in our society these days that we are supposed to think a certain way, that when someone challenges that we think it's wrong.

Clubs can have 25 players in the Premier League squad.

Of those 25, 8 must be association trained players, leaving 17 spaces for non association trained players. 

We submitted a squad of **only 18 senior players** in January. Of those 18, only 3 were homegrown players (Cahill, Terry and Fabregas, as you point out).

Those 18 players may be supplemented by any number of under 21 players. 

Kurt Zouma will still count as an under-21 player next season, but after that he won't be, and he won't count as homegrown either. 

So although we can add another two ""foreign"" players to our squad, we are already being seriously constricted by the lack of homegrown senior players in the squad. 

So we need to develop our own players, so that the transfer fees can be spent on hiring the best foreign players available to supplement the excellent English players we are developing. and given that we have the best youth squads in the country, it would be utterly ludicrous not to.

Capoue and Stambouli are both good players, no doubt, but beyond the typical midfield ball winning role we've seen them play, they're not used for much else. They're both slow, possess little threat going forward and their passing is average at best. This is also why players like Mason and Paulinho have been getting minutes over them when they are clearly inferior as pure defensive mids.

Its too bad because I feel like Stambouli could stay here more. Its too dangerous to be playing 2 CMs who both are expected to go forward as much as defend against big teams. And if anything, I feel like something like passing is an aspect you could continuously work on and try to improve unlike defensive instincts.

I think its either we keep one of Capoue or Stambouli. If Paulinho keeps up his form as he did last game, then I would not mind keeping him for at least another season. And I sincerely hope Mason does a Kane and improves fast enough to silence everyone.

There are 8 MLAs. Same-sex marriage has been voted on on three occasions in the past few years.

1, Anna Lo, voted for it on all three occasions.

2, Stephen Farry and David ford, voted for it on two occasions.

2, Steward Dickson and Chris Lyttle, voted for it on one occasion.

1, Kieran McCarthy, voted against it on one occasion.

1, Judith Cochrane, voted against it on two occasions.

1, Trevor Lunn, voted against it on all three occasions.

The Alliance Party [supports same-sex civil marriage and is not opposed to same-sex religious marriage](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-19450764).

That is not quite the same as supporting same-sex marriage.

So I don't sound like a nerd, I don't have that data memorised; I have a spreadsheet with MLA voting records in it because I have been emailing MLAs about this in advance of [Monday's motion](http://aims.niassembly.gov.uk/plenary/details.aspx?tb=&amp;tbv=0&amp;tbt=&amp;pt=&amp;ptv=0&amp;ptt=&amp;mc=&amp;mcv=0&amp;mct=&amp;mt=&amp;mtv=0&amp;mtt=&amp;sp=0&amp;spv=-1&amp;spt=&amp;ss=&amp;tm=&amp;per=1&amp;fd=27/04/2015&amp;td=27/04/2015&amp;tit=&amp;txt=&amp;pm=&amp;it=0&amp;pid=2&amp;sid=p&amp;doc=230998&amp;pn=0&amp;ba=1&amp;sd=0&amp;se=).

Thameslink - also godawful, actually much worse than South-west.

Southeastern - don't get me started. Some days they don't even fucking show up at all. I think there's a black hole at woolwich arsenal that eats trains.

Virgin - ok, but the wibbly wobbly train gives me travel sickness.

Tube - jesus christ please no. Except those new trains that are like bendy buses - those are just about tolerable.

Arriva - eh, middling, not great.

Northern - bloody hell, they're like buses from the 70's retrofitted to run on train tracks.

First great western - I actually like these, except for the ones where you have to open the door from the outside, likes it's the fucking 40s.

Haven't been on virgin east coast since it got privatized this year, it used to be pretty good, was disappointed when it was sold off.

Eurostar - embarrassing that we've been selling off our interest in it slowly, it's pretty good.


I have to say I am firmly in the camp of not liking privatization. At the very least, if it's publicly owned, you can do something about it if it's bad.

2. No, but the VAT will be paid by the customer at their own national rate. You don't have to collect the equivalent of VAT for a foreign government agency.

null,false,zenmn,null,null,null,"&gt;It's part of what I really hate about arguments with MRAs and Feminists; they're so polarising.

It's often true indeed. It's the same problem when binary arguments/debates everywhere. You are either entirely right or entirely wrong depending on what camp you designate yourself and the other person is in. It's like a human condition where we only want two answers or points of view because it usually resolves all complication for an argument and is easily processed to reflect your opinion.

&gt;If there's ever a thread about Female Genital Mutilation, you can bet your last biscuit that some knob is going to come along with ""What about circumcision?""; which is a perfectly valid concern and worth discussing, but not in a thread about FGM!

AARRGGHHH!! That fucking grinds my gears so badly. It's like they totally lack the self awareness that THEY represent/are supposed to be the group bringing forward the problems the men suffer in society. The two groups are intended to be focused on achieving gender equality by focusing on their respective genders. Yet if a a feminist stupidly went onto a topic of ""Male employment statistics in primary education"" spouting about female employment statistics in STEM they would completely lay into them for hijacking the thread.
 
&gt;The way to solve these issues is not to drown out the people discussing other issues; mens issues cannot be solved by denying that women also have issues.

Exactly. It's like one charity asking support for lung cancer research and then another charity coming along and saying, ""Uh, excuse me! What about pancreatic cancer?!?!""

It's like they refuse to see that both are designed to create progress and better futures that can benefit each other. The current topic that seems to be the en vogue of one-up-manship is rape statistics.

If MRA's fail to see how feminism has, and continues to, benefit men then they are heeding their own progress. And if Feminists look at valid points that MRA's bring to the table and ignore them because they are MRA's, then they too are heeding progress and undoing a lot of work they have achieved.

ST is probably the hardest position for us to get a better player than Ings. Like Ings is a decent striker, but a third striker at best for a top club. Dream signing is of course Lacazette or Dybala but neither is going to happen.

Auba is easily the best of the bunch but I don't see him leaving Dortmund.

CDM: Kondogbia is a freaking beast.  I don't know that we could get him if he wants to leave Monaco, he'll have some pretty big suitors in line.  Wanyama is a beast as well.  I would consider Illara more of a midfielder than a defensive midfielder.

Backup CM: Mason's starting for Spurs every week, he's not leaving.  Shame as he's a pretty tidy player and I quite like him.  Tielemans isn't ready for the premier league yet, but he's amazing for his age.  It's best to let him continue to develop right now.  Xhaka is a fucking monster, he'd be incredible.  He wouldn't be a backup for long though, he's got the quality to make it into our first 11.  Ward-Prowse won't want to give up the playing time I don't think, which is a shame because he's also a great young player with a big future.  I dislike Yarmolenko, Ki, and Fer, I don't think they're the kind of quality we need.  I don't know enough about Wijnaldum to really have an opinion.  I think Illaramendi should be in this category and he'd be my second choice (with Xhaka the first), though ideally we'd end up with both of them (realistically we've no chance at Xhaka though, IMO he won't be moving this summer).  I seriously doubt we'll but an actual defensive midfielder because it just isn't BR's style.

CB: Van Dijk is a beast, I'd love to see him get a shot in the premier league.  I don't know much about Nkoulou.  A player I'd like to add to this is Fabian Schaar though, he's a monster.  He's got amazing technical ability and pace for a CB, but is still strong and good in the air.  He's a very modern player and I think he fits BR's preferences for a player almost perfectly, I'd love to see him come in and continue his development at Liverpool.

RB: Pszczek is incredible but I don't think I'll ever say his name right :(  I like Uchida a lot as well, he could fit in pretty well.  I know he's on a loan to buy right now with Inter, but Santon might be a pretty good option as well.

I envision us playing 4-3-3 or the 4-4-2 diamond like we did last season, because it works with the players we have. So many players flourished in that system that it seems wasteful to abandon it just because we sold Suarez. Our team just has to grow around that loss.

I feel that we're crying out for a DM and a striker. Whenever Lucas is injured, we lose games. Ideally I'd like to see us bring in a better player than him and use him as the backup, rather than the other way around. There are only so many DMs of that quality in the world, and we're going to have to pay a ton for it.

The striker could be any one of a hundred names. Andre Ayew on a free looks like a tempting deal, since he's a fan and would supposedly consider wages around £50k. I'd like to see Balotelli stay and play in a two-striker system (which hasn't happened due to Sturridge's injury woes, as Brendan seems to have no faith in Borini or Lambert), but if he goes then we definitely need a striker on similar wages. Possibly try to grab Ings or similar quality as well in that situation: I think we need four strikers in the squad.

We should essentially break the bank on those two positions, since they're what we're missing. CB is not as vital, we'll have Sakho, Skrtel, Lovren, and Toure for the year, and all will benefit from having a proper DM in front of them in every game.

CM is not too important. Allen should be our backup Henderson - the midfield is not creative enough with both of them at once. We can use Coutinho as an ACM to good effect rather than using him as a winger. We also have Lallana for that role along with the tip of the diamond. A proper CM would be a useful addition, but I think we should wait another season and spend more next summer. 

RB is definitely a necessity with Johnson leaving. We have Flanno and if there is money spare we could bring someone in. But like CM and CB, I think ideally we should make do with what we have and spend big further down the line.",null,0,null,1429879195,null,0,false,0,cqn3hiy,null,t3_33p84q,null,t1_cqn3hiy,null,t3_33p84q,null,null,null,1432576327,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

Yes your body needs protein to recover, but not as much as usual and definitely not as much as if you were eating surplus calories with the intention of gaining weight.

Are you seriously asking what the difference is between *humanely* killing animals for a purpose that has been around longer than *humans as we know it* and beating 2 animals to death and hanging one of it's bodies from a tree? 

Are you so deluded in your views that you can not discern between murder and farming? Between barbaric brutality and quick, efficient and more than anything painless farming of animals bred for the sole purpose of being farmed?

Don't get me wrong, I can 100% get behind the idea that people may not agree with the idea of farming and I'd never once think to try and call out a vegetarian over their dietary choices for any reasons, but why would you expect anyone to even care about your existence when you take every single chance you get to call everyone that doesn't think like you a murderer? To equate everyone else in the world with the likes of mindless thugs that beat baby animals to death *for nothing more than shits and giggles.*

You're using the backs of murdered lambs as a podium, and to me, that makes you a rather dislikeable person. 

Also, a word of advice. Stop with the

&gt;why is it okay to be angry about these lambs but not the billions of other animals slaughtered every year for no reason and to the detriment of the earth and its inhabitants?

For one, no reason? Are you fucking kidding me? Are you so fucking stupid that you think farms serve no purpose? that we just grow animals to kill them, bury them or burn them away and repeat? How in a million years is it a detriment to the earth and it's inhabitants you deluded idiot.

Wrong.

Wrong again. Stop being silly.

This is also part of a tradition of black comedians who are really really funny but, though they are mostly apolitical,  I think reflect a kind of reflect values and attitudes that would be considered conservative in some ways at least.


I think there is something in the 'punching up' or mocking authority figures bit, but that there were lots of comedians who were more conservative (in one way or another and by today's standards) in the days when working men's clubs and variety performers dominated the genre, but since it's become the preserve of people who went to Russell group universities it seems to  generally have the same 'metropolitan establishment liberal' profile as much of the arts generally.

&gt;Who could be on a stage, crowing about their victory and ridiculing those less fortunate than them without any sense of irony, shame or self-knowledge? That’s not a stand-up comedian. That’s just a cunt.

Left wing comedians do this all of the time, they just do it to targets that are deemed acceptable by mainstream liberal axioms and right wing comedians just seem to frame their mocking of people below them in the social ladder as 'punching up', I remember that David Walliams framing  his mocking of 'chavs'  and stereotypes about people faking disability as 'satire' for example.

&gt;

&gt;__Greyfriars Bobby__ was a [Skye Terrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skye_Terrier) who became known in 19th-century [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh) for supposedly spending 14 years guarding the grave of his owner until he died himself on 14 January 1872. The story continues to be well known in [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland), through several books and films, and a prominent commemorative statue and nearby graves act as a tourist attraction.

* Bin all 3 and work the chemistry on an all-new lineup.
* Rest Top Gear and find x new presenters to do an all new car show that bears no resemblance to Top Gear whatsoever.

But it only takes the tiniest bit of vigilance to keep your intake under 2000 calories a day. I barely think about it, it's just a case of balancing what you eat, if you have a big lunch, cut back on dinner or pudding. If you're hungry, make yourself something filling rather than snacking on crisps or chocolate. 

Keeping your intake at that level means that you can maintain your weight with no exercise apart from walking about or whatever you do all day without thinking. Taking in 1700-2000 is very easy and would be even easier if you made a conscious effort to change the types of food you eat to make them more filling with fewer calories.  Going lower would require you to eat less or change the types of food you eat, but it's not exactly back breaking.

I'm not about making fat people feel bad. I might judge them on their choice, but I keep it to myself. What is important, however, is that being obese not be seen as acceptable. If you choose to be fat I really don't have that much of a problem, but if you're fat and believe that it's not just okay, but perfectly healthy you are simply delusional.

null,false,Ocean_Squeeze,null,null,null,"I'm seriously asking what makes one okay when neither are necessary. I'd like an answer instead of just a list of rhetorical questions for you to hide behind. 

I'm not sure farming is altogether humane. Well, firstly let's consider the fact that the vast majority of farming done in this country is intensive. There's nothing 'humane' about factory farming at all, and I'm pretty sure that you eat factory farmed food. You should do some research on farm conditions before claiming that all meat produced is efficient and painless.

But secondly, let's go to the real point, which is that there's no need whatsoever to do it. None at all. Nada. You claim that we've been doing it for thousands of years, since before humans were around. Okay, great, but we've murdering and raping each other for the same amount of time too and I'm sure you wouldn't defend that. So if there's no need to, why do you do it? There's no legitimate health reason so why do you do it if not for the very simple fact that you enjoy it (or that you don't know any better/just plain don't give a shit)?

Why do you care about the lives of these lambs and not the ones that you choose to have killed so that you can eat? Would your opinion of the kids who beat these baby lambs to death differ if they'd stunned them before? What if they'd eaten them after? Would that make it okay. I doubt it and I'll take a lack of response to this question as an indication that you've tripped and fallen over your own logical inconsistencies. 

How is it a detriment to the earth? Are you not aware of the serious environmental consequences caused by animal farming? And it's inhabitants, the animals (not just you). 

They do suffer because of you, writing 'wrong' doesn't make you right, it makes you a moron. You buy the meat and create demand so that more cows can have jacked bull spunk rammed up them, have their calves ripped away from them at birth and then have their throats cut just so you can eat burgers (and that's the nice version). Yeah, it's definitely you.

Fine, to be honest. I do think I'm better than you and I imagine my actions are in line with that. People that give all of their money away to charity and dedicate themselves to helping others are better than me too. Hey man, fun fact, some people are better than you, and I know it's a surprise but you do some shitty things everyday, one of which includes eating meat and animal products. But you really think I would waste my time replying to you just to feed my ego. I don't give a shit about that. I'm glad we can stop pretending now and maybe you can actually construct some kind of coherent argument, if not i'm just going to assume there's no point, eventually you'll die and the next generation of slightly more conscious, ethical people will replace you. Hooray. 

By the way, I *seriously* don't care if you think I'm smug or I'm an idiot so if you're going to reply spend more time trying to make an argument and focus less on trying to hurt my poor widdle feelings :'(",null,0,null,1429883287,null,0,false,0,cqn5eq3,null,t3_33l7ut,null,t1_cqn5eq3,null,t1_cqn40zt,null,null,null,1432577232,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

([Fortunately Wren-Lewis reponded and completely owned Warner](http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/more-on-myth-of-labour-profligacy.html))


The Telegraph are somewhat ironically the prime culprits of what Wren-Lewis calls mediamacro myths (he's writing a series on these now: [intro](http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/uk-mediamacro-myths-introduction.html), [1](http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/mediamacro-myth-1-2010-britain-faced.html), [2](http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/mediamacro-myth-2-labour-profligacy.html), [3](http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/mediamacro-myth-3-2007-boom.html), [4](http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/mediamacro-myth-4-immediate-necessity.html)).

We have a terrible habit of thinking oppression is fine when it's done by our allies. Look at Saudi. The actions of their government rarely gets questioned by ours but when Iran behaves the same the politicians are outraged. It's bullshit and I wish they would change.

I'm usually against intervening in foreign conflicts because as you've said, we only make them worse. But with ISIS i feel we have an obligation to try. The region is already in a mess because of the removal of Saddam and the poor policies that followed by the puppet government we helped put in place. We backed the removal of Assad in the beginning then back tracked when ISIS came along and we realised we'd opened up a can of worms. Now, I believe it can't get much worse and it's descended so far, firstly because of our intervention and secondly because of our later lack of conviction. ISIS have become the largest and most successful terrorist group, in terms of land controlled, ever. They are brutal, and western interventionism played a large party in their success. At this stage, we should either fund groups we deem sane enough to fight them and that we can trust enough to set up good governments after it ends. Or we need to put troops in the region to defeat ISIS, calm the region and allow rebuilding to occur. I prefer helping local groups like the Peshmerga and FSA than putting boots on the ground. But we still have the problem of Assad and the corruption in the Iraqi army to deal with. Assad has shown himself to be pretty brutal but a lot less vocal about his regimes actions than ISIS. While the Iraqi army has been incompetent and corrupt, as well as the iraqi government being corrupt and quite oppressive of Sunnis in the region. I'd support funding of certain groups, that will probably result in a slow grinding war, but probably has a better chance of resulting in a ruling power being accepted by locals to allow the stability that is needed.

What happened a few decades back was that the natives started either delaying kids or having none. Those that chose delay are now, in their 30s and 40s, having kids - hence the uptick. Overall, however, birth rates are still lower (especially when you factor in the longer inter-generational time caused by delaying kids).

The newcomers, however, bring with them the traditional approach of having kids when youngs - as well as fewer childless women,

Remember kids, history is written by the victors, but left-liberalism isn't an overdog here because they're still *punching up* (!) [at thin air] despite having complete control of this industry and having effectively banished their enemies from it forever. They're still the weaklings! Double BAFTA award winning Stewart Lee, ever the outsider. God, it's so hard being an underdog. Especially when the establishment continually ruins your cool by giving you awards for perfectly encapsulating and reflecting their values, which you try in vain to maintain are actually edgy outsider values.

That article you posted is an answer from the left, which is as notoriously myopic on this issue as you would expect it to be. If you want an answer from any rightists, then as follows:

http://atavisionary.com/why-are-there-no-conservative-comedians/

&gt;The culture is asymmetrical and it does not favor the right. Even the article clearly shows why conservatives must opt for aggression and confrontational attitudes if they are going to say anything. When Rush Limbaugh made a joke about some slut, hordes of leftists came out of the woodwork to use shaming tactics (i.e., “You’re an evil misogynist!”) to silence him. If you want to engage in any sort of public dialogue, therefore, you must do it from a position of dominance and assertion. Jokes require the audience to assent to the topic. If the audience won’t let you make a joke, you can’t make a joke. 

https://heartiste.wordpress.com/2015/02/16/are-liberals-funnier-than-conservatives/

&gt;If non-leftoids had the same freedom to parody cherished liberal icons — race, sex, eskimos, SWPLs, new atheists — with the same venom, I bet you’d see plenty of right-wing Daily Shows pop up. Right now, that freedom isn’t there, so mainstream righties have to stick with the liberal script, which in practice means essentially agreeing with the fundamentals of liberal progressivism while making feeble feints against the rapidity of that progress to which they have already tacitly acceded as inevitable. 

Comedy is the work of court jesters. They tell the court what it wants to hear. In days gone by this would have been flattering the king. You wouldn't have been likely to hear of a comedian/writer in the USSR doing jokes about how Stalin was a genocidal, paranoid monster; because that would seriously challenge the assumed values of that society and would cause outrage and hatred. Values need to be reflected and affirmed. Today, that means affirming the efficacy of left-wing liberal values.

i.e if a comedian tried to make a joke from a position where his values of assumed inegalitarianism and anti-political correctness were unspoken, the audience would not only [not connect or follow along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjPQ_jVlEnQ), they'd probably wonder if such an act should actually be investigated by the equality commission for inciting some form of hatred.

You won't hear this answer from anybody of a left-leaning persuasion though, for two reasons. 1) Because they do not like to think of themselves as overdogs in any capacity. and 2) because despite the values of our society being irredeemably demonstrably liberal, to the point where there are no actual, real serious challenges to it; to the left-liberals themselves, this society is *still not liberal enough* for them. There's still plenty of work left to do. After all, the Daily Mail still exists, does it not?

If you're looking for opinions on energy in general, it's pretty good stuff. Everyone uses it and more people will in the future. 

If you're asking whether you should invest your money in the energy sector, I have absolutely no idea and nobody else does either. I work as an engineer in the energy industry and I don't know a single person who both knows what they're doing and would claim to be able to predict the spot price of gas, coal, electricity or oil in the next 5 years, let alone 30. There are as many plausible scenarios for energy demand being much less than expected as for it exceeding expectations, and the same goes for supply. Maybe economic growth will accelerate and we'll all use more energy. Maybe global growth will be slow and efficiency/environmental initiatives will suppress demand. Maybe the Saudis have huge reserves and the US will carry on pumping out shale oil for decades, maybe this is a blip and we've hit 'peak oil'. Maybe shale gas, nuclear and renewables in China will allow the country to stop using coal completely within 30 years, or maybe coal demand will continue its general upwards trend for another 100 years. In the very long term, we will use up our existing reserves of fossil fuels. The very long term is not a timescale that is relevant to many people, even 17 year olds.

I will say that the energy sector, especially anything claiming to be renewable, unconventional, undeveloped or otherwise innovative or speculative, is absolutely rife with shitty ideas, scams and false hopes. If you're not an expert, stay away. If you are, you probably realise how little anyone really knows but you're not investing your own money anyway. In either case, just buy a general index fund for yourself. 

The same probably goes for biotech, although it's not an industry I'm familiar with. Individual investors generally significantly underperform the market, and moving in and out of 'hot' sectors is a big part of this.",null,0,null,1429888310,null,0,false,0,cqn8bxy,null,t3_33mp6i,null,t1_cqn8bxy,null,t1_cqmi281,null,null,null,1432578681,null,4,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,4,null

Party as a whole wants to win but David Cameron some serious doubts. Some rumours in westminster that in private donors have been talking about his 'lack of heart' 

Conservatives have yet to finish their grand plan, even worse from a ideological stand point party looks impossible to keep in line.  Party looks like it the back bench not the front bench is leading it with some unwilling to compromise.  Party is stuck in a changing world has forget that needs to change if it wants to become part of a government or win and not just promise change. 
What you can see is Conservatives ideological are in the middle of a crisis which requires a real leader who is willing to change the direction with the party following. Bit harsh but right now the party whole message is 'Ed is shit, Labour is to blame' no other message or vision what happens once the plan is done.  Apart from unfunded promises which majority don't agree with or want and the party is no longer talking about them. 

David Cameron is most likely happy at being unlikely to win he runs the risk of break up of the union, leaving the EU, recession and even more cuts. Fiscal plans of the party means lower spending sucking out demand from the economy a EU referendum is going to suck out investment of economy when it needs private investment and demand. 
Due to another recession due to the business cycle, so government policy likely to make that even bigger. 
Things go badly Tory party would see break up of the union, more cuts to come due to a tanking economy, leaving the EU.  Message everything is safe with the party would be quite a joke when looking at that backdrop.  Likely to do some serious long term damage make the group even more toxic. 

Right now the party is working on the assumption that always going to win due to Labour being terrible but they need to look in a mirror.  Making some tough choices if required force people out of the party and make ideological choices when it comes to direction.  Party needs to move on from the 1980s ideological vision.  Party is fine with spending £90 billion a year on landlords over a course of 5 years but when it comes to spending money on welfare for the poor that too far. British values the party has some questionable choices when it comes to policy. Banging on about how Labour screwed up but failing to remember most of Labour's policy was Tory based.   
 
Do think the party needs to go back to the grass roots find out what they want and most people as a whole.  Overlap does happen for most people who would not agree with greener, fairer society and reformed tax system.
We may disagree with the details but we agree with the overall end goal 90% of us do.  

I could be just as harsh to Labour and the Lib dems if I wanted. So far only the Greens and UKIP have a vision with Labour and the Lib dems forced into a battle most people don't care about only the media. UK has always got the job done instead we look onwards with a view we can't any more be a major player or provide good quality services. 

People throw around terms like 'Populist' without thinking what it means in reality. We ask for innovation and new ideas but when we get that called populist.

Fixing the disconnect is bringing politicians back down to a local level with everybody in the community being active.   Time to step outside of the west minster bubble, talking to people.  If anything Scotland showed us people want to be part of the debate and chat with politicians. 
Leaving anything to experts is not always wise they only see things from one direction. We're not rational business cycle proves that. 

Move to a more individual society did not make us happier did make us richer but cost us some sense of community.  Appears people are unwilling to look back at history or even review every school of ideologically position.
You would not use a hammer for every DIY job, and should not view the world as being full of nails.

We can't afford to compete with the likes of Chelsea, City and United for buying ready made players, this is how we have to do it. So yes it is a choice, but a choice to gamble on the potential of youth as we can't win any other way in the long term. 

&gt;we all knew was injury prone and then failed to strengthen in that area appropriately?

On thing is being injury prone, but nobody could have foreseen him missing practically the whole season. Yes we didn't strengthen adequately but we did buy two strikers, similarly with young players we got Balotelli because it's a pretty wide held belief that he still has bags of *potential*, if we play the same game as the other big clubs we will lose. When we signed Suarez it was a risk because there were doubts (for good reason) about his temperament, just because it payed off in a big way with him means that it will every time.

I find this absurd.  ISIS are just the next muslim boogeyman (most recently Taliban then Al-Queda).  The media is playing a big part in this.  Keep in mind that Saudi, Pakistain and a slew of other countries (or 'allies' no less) do a lot of despicable things too....  

&gt; We backed the removal of Assad in the beginning then back tracked when ISIS came along and we realised we'd opened up a can of worms

Let's keep in mind that many people (like you I daresay) were clamouring for us to send in troops against Assad.  This just proves the fluidity and complexity of area - and more importantly that our gun-ho (heh) strategies have failed in past and no reason they will succeed in future.

&gt; Now, I believe it can't get much worse 

I argue it will most certainly get much worse if we intervene further.  If you look at every other Middle East intervention as evidence I think I have a strong case.

&gt; ISIS have become the largest and most successful terrorist group, in terms of land controlled, ever. 

You have a strange definition of terrorist group.  My point is this is BS.  Taliban in Afghanistan, Bath Party in Iraq, Iran, etc etc etc... 

&gt; At this stage, we should either fund groups we deem sane enough to fight them and that we can trust enough to set up good governments after it ends. 

We are funding groups, Iraq, Kurds, Saudi, Turkey... We (more so the US) is into the Billions per year already on these....  We (UK) are sending plenty of guns you can be sure!!

&gt; But we still have the problem of Assad and the corruption in the Iraqi army to deal with.

Who do you think made them corrupt?!?!  Granted Russia played a larger part in Syria, but the point is it was outside influence.

&gt; Assad has shown himself to be pretty brutal 

He has always been!!!!!!!   As was his father!!!!!   this is not new!  Saudi is also very brutal!!

&gt; I'd support funding of certain groups, that will probably result in a slow grinding war, but probably has a better chance of resulting in a ruling power being accepted by locals to allow the stability that is needed.

that's what we are doing

But as to Ed Miliband's accusations of isolationism it is simply not fair to assume or claim that Cameron has wilfully taken Britain off the world stage and turned us into international pariahs. He's done anything but. He has routinely toured the world to sell Britain to various countries and seek foreign investors to come and engage in trade, and evidence of the Tory's success with the economy can be seen with things like the the IMF saying we'll be the largest European economy in a number of years if things continue, and even some plaudits saying that we're on track to be global powerhouses again.

But if we're going to talk about international meetings as the sole evidence of isolationism or not, the anyone who thinks that Ed Miliband has the strength or girth of character to walk into a room of foreign diplomats and electrify the room is just stupid. The guy can barely shine against a backdrop of Farage, Wood, Sturegon and Bennett. He's as dull as all fuck.

You know who else was at that Putin meeting? Francois Hollande. And do you know what they call him back home? Flanby. [This is a Flanby.](http://i.imgur.com/1eKk2EY.gif) Attendance at meetings means sod all when that's your reputation, and it's not hard to see how lacklustre Miliband is. You reckon Sir Nukesalot is going to give two shits about Britain turning up to meetings when he's got to talk to Miliband and his country's oligarchs are littered throughout London anyway representing a powerful bargaining chip, i.e. Britain won't push too hard anyway?

Listening to Mr Ed go on about Cameron's leadership is like watching an associate tell a director how to do their job. I think Cameron and Miliband both fall short of the ideal skill set to lead the country (but then they all do given that none of them have ever had a real job or dealt with real shit because they both have so much money), but when it comes down to it Cameron is a more charismatic leader. Do not assume that just because he'll end up being PM with a rainbow coalition that Miliband will be propped up by PR departments to do a good job. Across the sea not a far way away we have a few years of watching France stuggle internationally as a result of having a weak leader. That could very well (and I think will) be us come 8th May.

He was the only Japanese passenger on the [RMS *Titanic*‍ '​s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) disastrous maiden voyage. He survived the [ship's sinking on 15 April 1912](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic) but found himself condemned and ostracised by the Japanese public, press and government for his decision to save himself rather than go down with the ship.

This video is quite good about talking about the specifics but really the general first aid techniques should be understood in greater detail prior to application. I cannot stress enough that seeking further medical training is an invaluable skill. 

Another way it may be possible to maintain an airway without removing even a full face would be to pull the chin down and then put your thumbs below the lower mandible (on either side) and pull it forwards. This should allow the casualty an airway (their tongue will flop back but it won't be able to create a seal). If they've dislodged their teeth or part there of, this may not be effective.  Someone must always support the head or neck and the spine should be kept in neutral alignment if possible. 

Other points to consider. Cut the chin strap if you can. Two reasons, A its quicker than fiddling about with it and b it dissuades the helmet's reuse. This is current advice. No you're not going to get done for criminal damage as its very reasonable in the circumstances and the helmet has done its job at this point. 

Don't throw the helmet. Keep it nearby and place it down gently. Try not to lose it. Its possible for medical professionals to gain information from it. The deformation of the EPS (expanded polystyrene) liner can tell them a lot about the impact.

Don't pin this all on us. Afghanistan started spiralling long before we intervened. Even before the Soviet invasion there was a certain instability about Afghanistan. Yes we've haven't made things perfect, but they have been improved from a brutal Taliban government ruling the country.

Iraq? The first one was justified whilst the second was blatantly self interest.

Syria? That's a non win situation right there. We could have either supported the moderate opposition, a brutal dictator, or we could have done nothing. In the end we chose the moderate option which, without enough support from us, turned radical alongside IS causing a bigger shitstorm. I don't consider that our fault either.

Libya was a bit like Syria however we didn't support them in the aftermath - that was the problem.

I know of a few cadets who got in trouble with the law and they were dealt with very seriously, most were thrown out. 

The reasoning behind it is that as an officer you will likely spend a fair bit of time in court giving character profiles of your soldiers who have probably committed some assault or breach of the peace, and your legitimacy as an army officer presenting evidence to a civil court, and the legitimacy of the army as a whole under civilian law is immediately discredited if officers have any kind of criminal history.

The Army prides itself on values based leadership amongst it's officers, it is the first thing you learn about at The Academy and they drill it home for the entire year, infringements are dealt with brutally. One mis step can see you 'back-termed', namely being sent back 3 or 6 months to repeat previous terms (which, believe me, you do not want to do) or you are shown the gate.

Yes there is elitism and privilege, and yes the Army is a caring organisation and looks after their own. However no one is bigger than the Army as an institution of British life, and no one is bigger than the law. It would be silly to admit that there is not high-jinks, there are a lot of pranks and a lot of bad behaviour and some of it is pretty bad and shocking. This comes from putting a group of 90% males who are pretty alpha into a highly physical and brutal machine like RMAS. But anything that infringes on the law is not tolerated. Officers and Officer Cadets accept these high legal and moral standards, because the public has entrusted them, not only with the ability to use lethal force, but the duty of potentially instructing others to use lethal force and potentially sending a man to his death.

&gt;On 11 October 2011, following the emergence of concerns in respect of [European Union competition law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_competition_law) and particularly the risk of illegal state aid,    the deal to sell the stadium to West Ham was abandoned.  Once the original deal collapsed a new process to select a tenant was begun. The athletics legacy clause was clarified to ensure that a track remained in the stadium.  West Ham immediately announced plans to become tenants of the stadium.   On 18 October, [Leyton Orient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leyton_Orient_F.C.) submitted an application to the [Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League) for permission for a move to the stadium. Chairman [Barry Hearn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Hearn) said, ""We are asking for a 25,000-seater stadium and we want to see if we can get around the athletics track. It has to stay, we know that. But can we build up, if not down, and see if it's possible to get it covered while we play?"".

&gt; The Army did. It's standard practice. If you go to court you can take along a character reference from your employer. Anyone can. It's not ""Leaning on the Judge"".

The reason I said leaning on the judge is because if I got together with my mate and did the exact same thing, after 'going through a bad day'. There is no way in hell a reference from Mc Burgerking is going to get me to have a suspended sentence.

&gt; It depends on the case, some people do others don't. The Judge heard all of the evidence, you didn't. There may be an appeal if the prosecution aren't happy.

With this case, you have a video, even **if** the two people who are assaulted scream about raping the Soldiers Grandma what they did would be in no way an appropriate response. We see the entirety of the attack despite them censoring how it began we can see throughout it that no resistance was offered from the victims (who again everyone admits had no previous contact with the attackers). What other evidence could possibly be relevant to the attack?

&gt; Now I know you read my comment where I call them a disgrace so why are you asking this silly question ?

I ask because despite you saying its a disgrace you see no problem in the army still employing them. You ignore the importance of the intervention of the judge and the weight he put upon a reference, and the reasons he must have done so.

Yes.. and the same goes for paper money, and we all give that value. That's why swearing is offensive to so many people. Granted, it's more the tone than the swear word itself, but generally people use swear words *with* the negative/harsh tone and that's likely why people get offended. It's a bad association though. And there's far more to it too.

&gt; I mean, by your wording alone it looks as though you're saying that if you swear more and care less about others you'll be more relaxed and better off for it...

Yes. But you'd be someone people don't like. Who likes selfish people?

You talk as though the general public now have the authority once bestowed upon the monarchy.

&gt;You wouldn't have been likely to hear of a comedian/writer in the USSR doing jokes about how Stalin was a genocidal, paranoid monster; because that would seriously challenge the assumed values of that society and would cause outrage and hatred.

There were plenty of people who did say that about Stalin at the time and got sent to gulags or killed, not by the audience but by the state.

&gt;Yeah, rightists are so victorious and triumphant all the time, that's why they basically don't exist in this industry and have been driven out - because of all that power they have!

You know why there aren't many right wing comedians? Not because the left-liberal gay straight hating feminists who now so obviously run the industry drove them out. 

Its because they were shit.

Their jokes were about putting everyone else down, playing to age old vacuous gender or ethnic stereotypes and about creating an atmosphere of spite, all the while making out that they were the underdog being bullied and stripped of all power and wealth.

 -----------------

-  **Team news** - Everyone is fit. Remy is out for sure. Diego is good but we will make a decision tomorrow. Diego is almost there. He will play Lecisister for sure not sure about Arsenal. Solanke did not play for U21 so he is also available.
- **Comment on Zidane's quotes about Hazard being the best player besides Rolando and Messi** - Hazard is there with Ronaldo and Messi. He is a fantastic player. He just signed a new contract. He gave a lot of thoughts with his family, he likes league, he likes Chelsea and the team. He is not interested in leaving Chelsea.
- **Reaction to Fabregas at Emirates** I am not worried. I dont know why he didnot go to Arsenal. I know we promised him to build a team adapting to his style. He was looking for title and he is in our projects.
- **Rivalry with Wenger** - Its not different for me than being in Inter or Real. Every match is a match, it has no relation with earlier match. 
- **Future of Bamford** -I dont think he should think about future. He should focus on next matches. 
- **Unbeaten against Wenger** - We feel we can win.
- **Gossip about Hazard's move to Real Madrid** - I dont care. 
- **Drogba's form against Arsenal** - lets see if he can do it again. What he did it in the past does not matter.
