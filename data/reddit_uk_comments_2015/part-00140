One tip: Classes of schoolchildren go during the daytime (usually late morning) a lot of the days. Not sure if this annoys you (I did teaching at uni for 2.5 years and now avoid children like the plague), but just bear it in mind. Look out on the schedule for when children's book authors are reading (eg Jacqueline Wilson) and avoid avoid avoid. 

You can also pop in and out - go to St. Andrew Square (other end of George St.) for more Fringe fun or go read your books in the Botanic Gardens (also close to Charlotte Sq.).

This lead to the Opium wars, a humiliating defeat for China where the UK took control of Hong Kong, Shanghai and opened us the trade opium trade so the UK could addict Chinese to Opium. This gave us something to swap for their Tea.

However there's usually much less of an issue getting tickets for less mainstream events.

Admit is a bit of a loaded word. I'm saying without Cameron that would not have passed. Their leader is more socially liberal than most of the party. I don't claim it is only Cameron. The bill passed despite Tory opposition. They're not socially liberal by any metric I would consider useful.

&gt; I would also state that I find it more insidious that the left spends an awful lot of people that it's someone elses fault they're poor so don't ever feel the need to do anything about it because you're helpless.

Just as you accuse me of mis-characterising the right this is a horrible description of the left. For me it is about admitting that external influences have a much bigger impact on the outcome of your life at the moment. Rich people live rich and die rich. Poor people do the corollary. I believe limiting that helps create a better society for everyone. 

&gt;That is literally the guardians reason d'etre. To convince the poor and working class that it is someone else's fault they're poor and they can't do anything about it.

That's a straw man. Nobody thinks that. The reality is so many things outside of an individual's control have a huge effect on their quality of life. I don't think the right does enough to address that. I don't even think it is something they want to consider. I will - however - recognise my own bias against the upper classes. It's easy to get wrapped up and forget they are people and I don't want to promote that. It isn't fair to characterise all the right wing as heartless.

&gt;Last I checked Australia and America were doing fine. What is this obsession with 'inequality' anyway? As if it's the only metric by which to judge success. It's so ridiculously left wing. The wealth of the working class in both Australia and America has risen substantially. Not everything in society is about making everyone the same.

America has horrible problems with inequality. I understand if that isn't a metric you are using to judge how healthy a society is then all of this is a pretty pointless discussion. I'm not campaigning for equality of outcome. I'm a capitalist. I just think there is a problem when someone born into working class conditions has less opportunities than those who had a rich parent. Plenty of these criticisms of inequality fall down to unfairness. 

&gt;And you're not even the most interesting of my regular critics so get to work. I'm not going away princess.

Haha I think out of all the people I talk to on this website you're the one I would want to go away the least.

Of course they do. I'd never argue that. And by the way I come from a working class background. I have seen first hand how hard it is to break out of the cycle. My views on aspects of the left and the newspapers like the Guardian are shaped by what I saw first hand. Even teachers were guilty of telling kids that it was hopeless trying to escape the cycle. It was awful I'm a huge believer in thinking positively and that extends to many aspects of life. Everyone knows the story about the [4 minute mile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-minute_mile) and I believe life is like that. 

My grand theory is that we should greatly reduce income tax and replace it with some form of asset tax or perhaps even increasing IHT.

This way we are making it easier for people to accumulate wealth whilst ensuring that those who were given it or have accumulated it are forced to keep working to keep it.

We need new ideas to old problems and I haven't seen a lot of it being proposed by anyone. There are obviously radicals such as the Greens but there ideas aren't really new. We've tried their way of doing things. It didn't work.

Just like immigrants do? 

House numbers may be finite, but they are certainly not static. The reason we have a housing problem in this country is because there aren't enough being built, by pushing the blame onto immigrants you treat the symptom and not the problem ([and badly. House prices have been increasing since long before the accession of the A8 countries to the EU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordability_of_housing_in_the_United_Kingdom)). 

In order to build houses, we 1) need a strong economy and people to build them and 2) need to make it easier to build houses. Point 1) is in part addressed by immigration; immigrants are great because they tend to be young so don't put undue strain on public services, they pay taxes so there's more money to throw around and they can also fill gaps in the labour market, like [brick laying](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-30224320). 

Point 2 is down to the government. On the one hand they want people to be able to afford their own homes. On the other hand, at lot of people bought houses decades ago that have increased in value by orders of magnitude; they have their own little gold mine that they can flog when they reach retirement and live out their lives in comfort. These people also tend to be more politically active than the generation that followed, to whom buying a house is a fantasy proposition. The big parties have no real interest in bringing house prices back under control because a lot of people have got rich, and a lot of people wont vote for a party who say they are going to start chipping away at that goldmine you're sitting on. If you want to end the housing crisis then vote for a party that promises to end it through construction.

Honestly not sure how you arrived at that conclusion of the Owen Jones book. I read it myself and if you ignore some of his more extreme conclusions it is very well researched and puts forward some great arguments. I did a bit of fishing for criticisms after I read it and most were really shallow. Usually a good sign that he's on to something.

&gt;We've tried their way of doing things. It didn't work.

When? Something like a basic income sounds like a really elegant solution in my opinion. 

My politics I'm sure sound a little extreme to some people. I can't find a reason that people have so much and some nothing at all. When money can buy so much power and influence I'm not sure why we are allowing people to amass so much. It seems senseless to allow someone the accumulation of billions upon billions of pounds. We all got rid of kings for the exact same reason.

Except there is, right in the agreement itself: ""A credible Alliance nuclear posture and the demonstration of Alliance solidarity and common commitment to war prevention continue to require widespread participation by European Allies involved in **collective defense planning**, in nuclear roles, in peacetime basing of nuclear forces on their territory and **in command, control and consultation arrangements**.""

&gt;...but the host country cannot deploy the weapon without the country...

Again: So fucking what? 

a) This was never an issue of who controls the launch protocols for a given warhead, but one about who literally has and can use nuclear weapons. Peru has no nukes and cannot use them. Thailand has no nukes and cannot use them. Germany has nuclear weapons and in a severe enough situation can, as a member of NATO, use them. That you're now trying to restrict the parameters of this argument to such a redundant scenario demonstrates nothing less than the complete paucity of your position. Which is to say: 

b) The ONLY situation that would ever require the use of nuclear weapons is one that NATO would be involved in by default. Moreover, the weapons that would be used in such a situation are as likely to be the ones... outside US territory as within. With regards to those on foreign territory the ONLY reason they've been given leave to be there in the first place is if the host nation is involved in its use. There is no situation that could arise where say, German decides it needs to lob off a nuke or two and the US is all like ""No, that's ours."" Acting like there is, displays a critical knowledge failure regarding how such weapons came to be in these countries in the first place.

&gt;So if I have a bomb that I have no ability to use myself, am I armed?

You are armed with nothing but a shit analogy, since the only purpose of the agreement under discussion is that these nations should be EFFECTIVELY armed. You understand what the word ""effective"" means, right?

How about: If I give you a gun, are you armed? Yes, you are obviously armed. Can you take out that gun and blast it about willy nilly? No, obviously. You are bound by the strictures of the agreement you made as a citizen of the country in which you live.

Like what? I feel we do get a good return on Trident's money. The money being spent on it is not going to disappear down a black hole. 

The money is spent within the UK and therefore contributes massively to the economy, directly to the people involved and those in the surrounding area who service the workers like food joints, pubs etc. 

It also pays the wages of very clever people who have to be supremely good at what they do and it’s important to hold onto talent like that. These people also then have the ability to move into other areas with the transferable skills gained on the Trident project, be it work like work into aerospace or energy.

I’d also argue that there is no evidence that a UK disarmament would make the world a safer place as people tend to claim. It wouldn't convince other nations, rouge states or groups that have nuclear weapons to also abandon them, nor would it dissuade other countries from seeking them.

Likewise the UK is a fully functioning, stable democracy that has no extremist tendencies. It is a permanent member of the UNSC and a recognised nuclear weapons state. If anything I'd argue that removing nuclear weapons from a stable democracy would make the world a less safe place as the balance of power tips towards those nations that have, or seek to have, nuclear weapons that aren't quite as stable. 

Look at Ukraine. This might be a bit of a sensationalist example but they gave up approximately 5000 nuclear weapons in 1994, in a triumph of global peace and harmony. A treaty was signed stating that, in exchange, the USA, UK, and Russia would work together to ensure that Ukraine's territorial integrity would never be threatened. France and China gave similar assurances.

Wow that is a hard one, I guess it depends on your point of view. From my point of view I believe what has been proven by people who spend their lives finding answers to questions. Science tell us that life exists because it does, end of, no big mystery. There is no point to anything so you might just as well except that and have fun.

My immediate family are all republicans and some of my extended family have done serious time for their actions. I am, would be considered, a moderate, left leaning, pro-choice, atheist unionist.
My problems with Sinn Fein are numerous. I can remember members of the party using terms like ""Legitimate target."" That is the most sickening terms that were coined during the troubles in my opinion. Try telling an 8 year old child their police officer father in traffic branch was shot because he was a ""legitimate target.""
I don't like their double standards. They say it was a war, okay fair enough. Then wars are governed by the Geneva convention and one of the rules of that is not targeting civilians, which the IRA, dress it up as much as you want, did target civilians.
They are trying to rewrite history. When I was writing my Masters on the Civil Rights movement, not one person I talked to could remember SF or members of SF being of any major or significant influence. The way SF talk, they created the whole damn movement.
I don't like how they govern. Look at the record of their Ministers and try and convince me they have been a benefit to the people of Northern Ireland. We now have 2 self regulating transfer tests. Northern Ireland is being dragged into the financial stoneage because they don't want to contradict their stance in the south, one Minister was sued because he denied an appointment and his decision was found to be based on religious and political background. One Minister went against Civil Service advice and got the department sued by the European Union to the tune of millions.
They want an Irish language act where every government and council body in Northern Ireland should provide their official documents in Irish. Why? How many people are going to request council minutes from Larne Borough Council in Irish? It's a waste of time, money and effort.
I could go on but that's just a flavour of why I don't like SF.

&gt;Peter Nunn, 33, retweeted messages threatening to sexually assault Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy.

&gt;The court heard he sent the posts after the Bank of England said Jane Austen would feature on the new £10 note.

&gt;Nunn, from Bristol, had denied the charges, claiming he was ""satirising"" the Twitter backlash to the campaign.

&gt;District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe found him guilty of sending indecent, obscene or menacing messages at a hearing at the City of London Magistrates' Court. The judge said: ""I'm in absolutely no doubt that those tweets, on an objective basis, are menacing.""

&gt;She also warned him she was not ruling out any options, adding ""as you are aware, prison is extremely likely"".

&gt;One message posted described the ""best way to rape a witch"", the court heard.

&gt;He also wrote: ""If you can't threaten to rape a celebrity, what is the point in having them?""

&gt;When asked why he posted the messages, Nunn replied: ""It is just a joke. It came into my mind at the time and I thought it was really, really funny.""

&gt;Nunn told the court he did not mean for a message he retweeted and which threatened to rape Ms Creasy to read as a threat, but was instead a show of support for the MP.

&gt;He also admitted posting a message to Ms Perez telling her to treat threats to rape her as ""a compliment"".

&gt;District Judge Roscoe said Nunn was not a credible witness and accused him of being ""evasive"" and ""delusional"" in court.",null,0,null,1429045484,null,0,false,0,cqceq58,null,t3_32k3l7,null,t1_cqceq58,null,t1_cqbyb1n,null,null,null,1432391672,null,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16,null

So all this will do is allow the government to free up some of the vast amount of money eye which is currently locked in council housing.

The guy doesn't even speak Russian, so how am I supposed to take his foreign policy analysis seriously when he obviously just reads articles on BBC, CNN and just goes 'huhhhh dey r wrong', he blatantly hasn't read anything coming out of organisations on the ground like OSCE, NATO, or even CIS observers who are there on the ground. He doesn't even reference any respected think tanks who have commented and informed on the issue. He even gets figures wrong, that are really fucking easy to find. He claims that Russia's economy is '50%' dependent on oil, while every single academic and respected source on the matter I've read (I'm an economist), states that their dependence is closer to ~70%. How am I supposed to take 'hurr non-corporate media seriously', when they can't even get their basic figures correct?

Your post was ambiguous enough in its intention that I can see why someone might respond defensively

Good on you for not inherently opposing what you don't understand, though. :)  Sadly, too few people share your perspective.

Also, related to your first comment: very often the selection of/gravitation towards a particular club isn't *actually* arbitrary.  There are often distinct reasons why a foreign fan chooses a club, and many people go through a pretty thorough and rational decision process. (There was an illustrative article by Bill Simmons about choosing Spurs a while back.)

Others go through a semi-thorough, quasi-rational process.  And there's also some subconscious elements of it that seem arbitrary but are anything but.  (Especially on the issue of whether one's elective support solidifies into true ""Spurs til I die"" support.)

And of course, some choose a club because they happened to get stuck with in some Football Manager tournament.  From a certain point of view, though, this is no more arbitrary than supporting a club because you happened to be born in a certain part of London to a certain sort of family.

If you didn't understand the words, just ask. I was saying that neither are given allowances in the private sector so why should the state sector be any different? 

&gt; You simply haven't posted anything to discuss.

Again, if you don't understand, just ask. I've posited that those who do not contribute taxes to the state should not be able to live a better quality of life than those who do (in this case specifically with regard to housing and how far they are expected to travel for work). Do you agree or disagree and if so, why?

&gt; You don't have any knowledge on the subject you just post what you've read.

Aside from the fact that is an oxymoron, I do know a great deal about the subject having been both a tenant and a landlord, having relocated for work and having had both long and short commutes. Practical experience aside, I have indeed also read about the issue and that is how one obtains knowledge of the subject. 

&gt; I even quoted the CBI no's and you don't even comment on that.

It was a bit of a change in topic but we can switch to a macro discussion if you like. The principles remain the same and the policy issues around cost, infrastructure limitations and supply optimisation do too. The two main issues are that the CBI is referring to lost opportunities to make money rather than actual costs (which influences government decisions about social housing planning significantly) and the other is that the solution would have direct cost to government (which at a time of economic fragility is a gamble for the government).

The EU and USA had a coup against the democratically elected pro Russian government, Russia obviously wasn't happy, this new Government wanted to change the terms of the lease of the Crimean military base and have closer ties with the EU, the east of the country wan't happy and wanted a new election. They said no. Protests began, Russia annexed Crimea, elections in the east happened to secede, Ukraine said no and a civil war broke out. The US and EU are funding the Government and Russia are funding the Rebels. All of this is over oil and resources.

Why is a party with 20% of the vote always being in power a problem if 20% of the population are always voting for them?

Any power they wield within government would be commensurate with their share of the vote: if they get 5% of the vote they're going to have less impact than if they get 25%.

Handing ""huge amounts of power to a party that is third in popular support"" is less of a problem than our current situation, where we hand *all* of the power to a party which only one-third of the population support.

null,false,Eisenhorn_UK,null,null,null,"&gt; How do we fix this? This is an emergency. The researchers themselves claim that the majority of British Jihadis are South Asian - zero connection to the middle east. It's madness.

I agree. But I am at a bit of a loss to suggest any solutions to the madness when I am - as I have been for a while - stuck on the horns of an internal moral dilemma, as follows.

You've got all these folk who've had this beautiful image of righteous jihad poured into their brains and they thus skip town, head to the Turkish border and go and fight for whichever barbaric Islamo-militia will take them. And my dilemma is: well...since most of them are going to die...doesn't the problem sort of solve itself...?

As in, if these fucking morons have this inclination within themselves, then is it not a good thing for the rest of us that they are voluntarily opting-in to a lifestyle that is very likely to end up with them dead?

Now, this is obviously the attitude of a monster without morals, who has no empathy and who thus should in no way, shape or form be allowed to have any views of any kind on any thing of any importance. But I am still stuck here, position-wise. Even your description of it as being an emergency triggered some shitty, bastard of my brain to protest that it isn't an *emergency*, it's *useful*. I am thinking of applying a soldering-iron to this part of my brain, because I don't like the idea of sharing a skull with any lobe who views a human as being not worth the effort of saving.

Anyway. All of this is nothing more than a re-hash of the various ""Should we let them go"" debates that have occupied the media for so many months now. But it's not something that I personally have been able to progress from, being the type of chap who needs to work things through from first-principles.

null,false,TjBee,null,null,null,"WHAT A MATCH. It's the last one I could make this season and it was a fantastic one to finish. Props to the Leeds fans who were nice and noisy with us.  

Here's my two cents on the match...  

**Howson** would be a good place to start. He played well in midfield, won us a penalty and took his goal for 1-0 very well. Great composure and probably deserves MOTM.  

**Dorrans** hit the underside of the bar with the first half penalty which made for a more nervous match but he made up for it in the end with a great fake shot and finish on the edge of the box.  

**Redmond** is so frustrating. When he takes the player on he makes chances. But he has this habit of stopping and then just passing it sideways when a 1 on 1 would have him through. He's got so much potential it's just frustrating to watch.  

**Hoolahan** could also be more direct. He's great for getting out of little gaps, but when he's in lots of space he can't help but run into trouble to try and get out of it again. It makes sense for him to go off at 60 minutes when we're looking for a second goal on the counter attack. Decent enough game from him though.  

**Jerome** worked his socks off all game and then set up the winner beating the Leeds left back. Even when he's not scoring he's invaluable.  

**Hooper** looked a class above when he came on. Great touch that man has.  

**Whittaker** had a very good game. Got forward well as always but was also defensively sound.  

**Martin** was great. Great captain to have for this stage of the season and he got out of trouble a few times very well.  

**Bassong** won literally every header, but his passing can still sometimes be a little off which could end up costing us one of these days.  

**Olsson** was very good, although got a bit worked up in the first half and talked his way into a booking.  

**Ruddy** made 3 bad clearances in the second half, but WHAT A SAVE he made at 1-0. I was sure it was in. Smashed from the edge of the box and deflected as well. When you see it you'll be impressed.  

**Tettey** was solid at CDM. He's a class player and I'm glad we've kept him. He's premier league quality. Came close from the edge too.  

The player I think we need to nick from Leeds *this* year is **Mowatt**. Dead ball deliveries were top notch and his composure in midfield for a young lad was very impressive. Sign him up!

&gt;And my dilemma is: well...since most of them are going to die...doesn't the problem sort of solve itself...?

The thing is, these people don't simply end up liquidated - they kill, rape, torture, and oppress others. 

Yes, we might be able to kill a lot of them with airstrikes - however those put civilians at risk. And yes, rebels/militia and government forces might kill them - but then they put themselves, and civilians at risk.

Basically, these people don't exist in a vacuum. We can't allow our citizens, our people (whether they like it or not), to ruin lives... to ruin civilization. We have a responsibility to protect the most vulnerable in society. And there are few more vulnerable today than the people of Syria (and sadly, western Iraq).

A solution has to be long term, as much as I support the current military action and aid. I have personally come to the conclusion that it's time for us to take some degree of control of Islam in Europe, and move it towards peace and liberal democracy. For two decades we have allowed all sorts preach dangerous things - in the guise of an infallible religion (that's one of the reasons we have such issues with Islam imo).

null,false,otterdam,cnty-uk,Lahndahn,null,"&gt; it's very disingenuous to describe it as out of thin air

What's really disingenuous is to describe money like it's a tangible commodity. Should lending never goes wrong, either banks end up with all the money, or the money gets created somehow. This is what trips up a lot of people and analogies like the one you give don't actually help you understand anything more than why we need interest rates. Maybe you can confirm my understanding here:

The reason we have debt and savings is to shift consumption before or after earning the ability to consume. When someone buys a car on credit, the dealer has the money now which they can spend whenever they like - or more likely, pay their own debts, which continues from business to employee to business till you reach someone's pension fund.

Of course this raises a whole bunch of questions as to how soon the creditor is allowed to spend their money, what happens if the debtor never fufils their promise to 'produce' equal to what they consumed; I am sure you understand the full implications of, and current solutions to, these problems. But fundamentally money is 'thin air' because it only describes the balances owed between individuals. You don't even have to get the banks involved if you want to do arbitrary double-entry bookkeeping, not that you should.

At this point money coming out of 'thin air' should sound like the absolutely necessary thing to happen, not something bad.

AIUI fractional reserve banking is a fallacy because it implies the banks only lend out money because they have deposits, and thus any expansion/contraction in the amount of deposits affects the amount lended accordingly. However, the implied causality doesn't match reality, at least as described by BoE. The goal is not to make sure all the 'loans' are 10x the deposits, it's to achieve a stable ratio of debt to savings over the long run, acting as a proxy for production and consumption.

edit: I also understand that as a business you don't get the banks involved when you send someone an invoice, the 'arbitrary double-entry bookkeeping' comment is meant to apply to not-currencies (barter system) ",null,0,null,1429049967,null,0,1429050374,0,cqchgps,null,t3_32jsxq,null,t1_cqchgps,null,t1_cqc1upg,null,null,null,1432393033,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

I like the initial choice of *Interstellar* for music as it gives a contemplative and meditative tone that you don't often associate with online football compilations. I am less of a fan of the second piece of music, as it is a bit generic action-y, as well as getting a bit in the way of the commentary, but I understand why it was chosen wrt to a change of tone. The audio work is generally very proficient, especially so in the first half of the video.

The editing is non-obtrusive, works from a pacing point of view (especially so in the first half - I must stress how well that first minute or so works), and uses the right amount of different sources - clearly you have done a lot of hunting around. I appreciate you not stuffing the video to the gills with as many shots of one incident as possible - it ruins the flow and rhythm of the piece, as well as creating a cloying sentimentality. One very small issue I have is with the transition between the first and second halves of the video - it seems a bit sudden, and doesn't quite work for me thematically, although the Shankly quote goes some way to rectifying this (tradition : belief : going back to the roots is a strong link, and works fairly well with Brendan going into the tunnel.) 

Finally, I appreciate your going for a non-chronological season overview - firstly, as they're boring, and secondly, as it avoids the rollercoaster-y, emotionally unsatisfying nature of cataloguing a season that way. While of course it's a little lie to call this a season of two halves, it works better that way as a narrative, and who knows, perhaps the juxtaposition of successes and failures often months apart hints at the more fragmentary, 2 steps forward, 1 step back nature of this season.

I have a good (well, better than average let's say) understanding of most areas of law and policy the Green's pipe up about. I currently work for a legal aid clinic, and in my main degrees/qualifications I've focused on IP/IT (innovation), Corporate/Commercial, as well as Jurisprudence (philosophy/ethics in law). I've also studied some legal history. Consider it a fair mix of economic-focused areas of the law with more humanistic ones.

I do like the Lib dems in some areas under Clegg. Looking forward to what the Lib dems offer when it comes to legal reforms and other areas.

&gt; There's a difference between something being costed in a simple way and it being a credible plan. Merely costing it or spelling it out in terms a teenager would understand doesn't make it credible.

That true but making it clear does help.  Whole plan is based on some rather basic economic theory which is proven.  Would like to know what is incorrect about this plan.

I am of the mind that 60+ hour weeks are pointless anyway, and once you start getting past 40 or so you will be losing productivity anyway, but I agree with the main thrust of the point. 

How do you incentivise people to work harder (because of the basic demands of the type of work) while avoiding 'revolution' levels of inequality.

It's quite effective because, as most would accept, parties like the Greens (and Ukip - their right-wing populism counterpart) have no chance at gaining more than a handful of seats. Their strategy is to get as many people to believe their narratives about certain states of affairs. Once the narratives set in, the details don't matter too much in terms of the base of support they now have. It's a particularly effective strategy when you combine it with a general political disaffection.  

I'm all for transparency in the process as well. It's tricky to get it right though because at the end of the day they are a political party with an agenda to peddle. To be blunt, they want power. Meanwhile, economic theories are almost by definition quite contentions/debatable. For every economic opinion out there, one can find another that contradicts it in some way.

I originally bought the quad before the singles were released and found I hit pan very quickly even with colours I barely used. I use primarily the green which does the trick but would suggest [Boots' Natural Collection green concealer] (http://www.boots.com/en/Natural-Collection-Corrector-Stick_25825/) instead. It has a much thicker, smoother formula and provides more of a correction imo.

The highlighter is wonderful: stays all day, a teeny bit glittery but defo catches light pretty well. A good product to start with if you're starting to get into highlighters.

The powder blushes are very pigmented and natural looking and amazing for the price!

The E3 brush is decent. I LOVE all the MUA brushes but I find this too small for my taste for blending large areas of eyeshadow in the crease - but it's good at blending shadow under my eyes! Although if you already have a HG blending brush for your crease I wouldn't bother too much over this.

Ohh and ofc the fixing mist, I loveeee this! Perfect for applying eyeshadow wet and I've only recently started using it to spray my entire face like I would with MAC's Fix+. I honestly think it's very close to (if not as good as) MAC's. I have skin like the Sahara year round and this totally helps with that!

Oh and MUA's [face powder in shade 4] (http://www.muastore.co.uk/pressed-powder) is my go to for contouring and bronzing. Goes on amazingly with their [F6 brush.] (http://www.muastore.co.uk/f6-blusher-contouring-brush) Completely matte and not too crazy warm toned.

Cup final and youngest team in the league are pretty special in my opinion. If Poch can achieve cup finals and maintain the status quo with the kids, then the club are in a really good spot.

I don't think achieving champions league football will be possible without the new stadium and its revenue, certainly not with the now resurgent Liverpool and Manchester United. 

The stadium has to be the number one priority right now, promoting guys like Pritch and Carroll into the first team squad and moving out deadwood will only bring that closer (the % of our wage bill that is on the bench is staggering: Soldado, Adebayor, Paulinho, Dembele and Kaboul would all be on a pretty penny).

Russia is a massive, powerful country and in many ways entirely self-sufficient. It doesn't want to be part of some big multi-cultural love in, its wants to just be Russia and do its thing.

For years Russia has been essentially persecuted. The hostile attitude that the USA holds towards Russia is almost sickening, and then obviously the rest of us in ""The West"" follows the US's lead.

Why should Russia and the people of Russia be so receptive to immigrants? Is it some sort of universal law that countries must accept immigrants, or is it a Western ideal that we are forcing upon them?

And with regards to the whole 'non-white' thing - I didn't see it as them hating on blacks per se, but more hating on blacks living in Russia... I think they are perfectly happy for black people to live in Africa or for 'brown' people to live in Asia, but they just weren't happy with them coming into Russia. Thats hardly an extreme opinion. Go to Africa and see how happy people are in support of white or Chinese people moving there in numbers...

And remember, Russia never really went to Africa or deep into Asia, so there is less of a 'white-guilt' thing going on. Why should they be so open-armed to immigrants if they don't want to be? The ex-USSR states is another thing entirely, and they should work to improve that situation, but as far as everything else, I struggle to really care.

Why would you want him to succeed then? Have you read about his 'Spider letters' - he's been influencing politics in one way or the other in the UK for decades.

&gt; I think a lot of people enjoy the speech and it isn't a huge use of public money or anything so I see no reason to stop the tradition

I'm not really concerned about how much money is spent on them, as its probably not that much (but still too much) - it's the sense of entitlement I get from the fact that she even gets to make the speech that bothers me. I remember seeing a bit of one a few years back when she was talking about austerity etc. Who the fuck is she, to be on to the regular person about austerity to? Fuck that, she doesn't know what it means to have money troubles. Shes not wise whatsoever in the matter, yet she addresses the nation about it as if shes wise. Let her live on £56/week for a bit and then she can say a single word about it.

As for tradition - Britain/the UK is a slave to it - there's no room for sentimentality when it comes to fundamental things like taking an oath to the monarchy if you want to serve your country etc.


&gt;  but the wedding on the other hand is a topic for debate. Sure it was a huge expense but it did attract tourism and get coveragè around the world so It did serve some purpose.

I've yet to hear any tourist giving ""they have a monarchy"" as a reason for visiting a country. Sure Spain, Norway, Sweden, Denmark etc etc have monarchies but I don't think people go to Magaluf for the King/Queen. London has great shopping and architecture, and art scene, like Paris -  the significance of Buckingham Palace is great whether there is a monarchy there or not, it still has great historical value and it will still be a contributing factor to tourism, a 'sight to see' either way.

&gt; I may be bias as a unionist but I don't see the whole lording over you thing.

I remember visiting Ulster Museum before, and there was tons of sketches done by none other than Leonardo Da Vinci himself - authentic pieces by one of (if not *thee*) most famous artist in human history. About 30 pieces. They came from 'The queens private collection' - and then she goes and asks for more money, more funding. Sickening. The Royal family 'own' 1/6 of all land *on Earth*. Yet they ask for more funding. The Royal family goes and visits some tribe in sub-Saharan Africa, a tribe with *nothing* to their name, and the fucking *tribe* gives *them* gifts!? What the fuck. Tribes get nothing in return apart from the opportunity to humour some toff for an hour or two. The amount of PR ""visits"" to places which amount to no more than thinly veiled holidays is staggering. Every one of them no doubt televised to see how benevolent the lovely family is. Fuck that.

&gt; Most of the royals don't seem that way the queen, William and kate and hurry all seem sound.

You see, once you take in to account that 95% of anything you see about them comes through numerous Public Relations teams and filters, you start to think 'maybe I'm not seeing the *real* person here'. Does the *Heroic Harry* we see trekking with injured soldiers to the arctic circles, and fighting on the 'front lines' in Afghanistan match up with the Harry we saw (on *private* holidays/events) dressed up as a Nazi or dressed up in his birthday suit and nothing else, boozed up and spending thousands on nights out? Doesn't match to me.

&gt; Sure the queen bought a painting over here from a normal person.

What an honour for the guy, the queen spent public money on a piece he made.

True, but as a society do we still *need* that tiny but of added efficiency? Is that a society we want to be part of? 
I am of the mind that there will come a point, if it has not arrived already in many countries, where efficiency of resource extraction, from both human and natural has stopped being of such critical importance.

Oversimplification Greens to spend the money on investment to boost productivity and demand.  Forgive me but if borrowing at record low rates on roads and training is not economic viable what is? PFI £51 billion cost for £200 billion debt? 

&gt; The impact of a lot of their policies is totally unconsidered, especially capital flight and the possible total wrecking of the economy by ridiculous increase in public spending, which would send investment spiraling into the abyss and halt any growth. 

Capital flight is only going to happen due to another financial crisis.  Given the pace of reforms when it comes to the financial sector unlikely to happen quickly causing a bank run. Business investment is currently in stagnation and overall investment.  Questions around the fiscal multiplier used by the Green party on their growth numbers increasing investment is unlikely to decrease growth. 

Must be said that both sides work on assumption when it comes to markets and the private sector.  Your assumption that public spending decreases growth and the greens want stated owned companies [just want the rails in this plan] also made some other assumptions too.

My choices were:
Physics, Chem, Maths(b) and Compsci.

Materials, from what I've heard is really interesting and also 'easier' than some other choices. It seems the majority take materials.

I chose compsci for the exact reasons you stated. And quickly found that Compsci is hard. Only 3 at my college take this module, and the workload is significant. You have to do ML (a programming language) first term, which I'm convinced is soul purpose to torture freshers. However, the subject is rewarding, but does assumes basic knowledge of programming. You attend some of the same lectures as the pure computer science course, so it can move very quickly, which is why I would say CompSci is one of, if not the most difficult module.

It may sound like I'm trying to dissuade you, and in a way I am. However, if you're up for a challenge and you're willing to spend a non trivial amount of time learning 'extra' material I would recommend it.


Chemistry is great, however my opinion is biased, as I'm partial to the subject anyway. The material continues from A-level, which makes it very easy at the start of term. The practicals, while long (~5 hours) are usually fairly enjoyable. The work, like everything else is challenging.

This is clearly because they were Muslims making prayer. (As the actual tweet specifically mentions the faith.) You can't simply choose to tolerate one religion and then reject another.

2. What message does this send to the millions of Muslim and international LFC fans across the globe? Football and LFC is about coming together to play the beautiful game without giving a damn about colour, race, religion and all the rest of it.

3. It's incredibly obvious that the British Asian community is behind in producing footballers despite having the same interests as other ethnic communities. These sort of actions only go on to further stereotypes and bring people away from football stadiums. Imagine the effect this will have had on the little kid who was waiting for his father to finish prayers? You're joking if you say he won't remember this for a long time. Others will take this as a deterrent from visiting Anfield.

Edit: Ok lets say for a second he hasn't actually broken any rules then the best way to explain what he's done is to use the analogy of someone who looks for legal loopholes in order to avoid paying tax. Perhaps an action that's still within the law but the intention is ultimately to break the law.

null,false,TrickyDickNixonbot,,"Andy Burnham: Indestructible ",null,"&gt; Oversimplification Greens to spend the money on investment to boost productivity and demand. Forgive me but if borrowing at record low rates on roads and training is not economic viable what is? PFI £51 billion cost for £200 billion debt?

Because thats not how it works. Not only will blowing money on those things not do anything in the slightest to actually reimburse the economy, especially considering there are alternate ways of conducting training programs and most of the mass-road-deprivation that is seriously harming the economy (which Greens seem to think is happening) has to yet materialise. Now I see you've caught the old disease of thinking Keynes is applicable right now, when hes not. Pumping money to boost investment wracks up public debt, creating money from nowhere and new wealth from nowhere does not boost market confidence, it releases a temporary burst into the economy that'll be unsustainable as the deficit skyrockets, it continues to not get paid back, the economy continues to grow only marginally (unless you create *more* debt to create *more* short-term gain), and the whole thing enters a painful cycle of spiraling into total collapse.

As my original comment stated, the Greens are playing the old game of 'oppose fiscal restraint for the sake of opposing fiscal restraint', because theres this odd conception that unless you want to launch into tirades of deficit spending you're not left-wing. Growth can just as easily be mobilised by stimulating the economy with real wealth and real demand, not debt-created wealth and demand that'll crash after a short-term boon. This is the contrast between Labour and the Greens. Labour is trying to generate real hard wealth and use that to drive growth, Greens want to toss monopoly money at things and wait for a complete crash. Now of course im going to get the inevitable Attlee invocation, Attlee restrained demand via rationing, and we had debt-free lending under the Marshall Plan to spur growth. Totally different times.

&gt; Capital flight is only going to happen due to another financial crisis. Given the pace of reforms when it comes to the financial sector unlikely to happen quickly causing a bank run. Business investment is currently in stagnation and overall investment. Questions around the fiscal multiplier used by the Green party on their growth numbers increasing investment is unlikely to decrease growth.

So basically you want to take the failed Tory plan, and turn it into a failed Green plan with a huge toss-money-at-things campaign? For reasons I clearly outlined above, investment created via debt =/= market confidence and genuine sustainable growth. 

&gt; Must be said that both sides work on assumption when it comes to markets and the private sector. Your assumption that public spending decreases growth and the greens want stated owned companies [just want the rails in this plan] also made some other assumptions too.

Wrong, my assumption is public spending in times of serious deficit and stagnation is a terrible idea and ends up killing economic growth. Labour actually set aside quite a bit for public spending prior to the crash, contrary to the 'Neoliberal Labour' myth endlessly propagated by the Greens. Once we're out of the deficit, no doubt we'll see public spending and investment go up again, as well as the possibility of renationalisation of the rails and mail come back onto the table. Right now, Greens dont seem to grasp that not only do the rails *not* pay for themselves (unless run on a commercial basis or run with high prices on fares, which defeats the purpose of renationalising them) but that renationalisation is an incredibly costly process. You have to not only reintegrate a massive governmental structure which costs a lot of money (which, im sorry Greens, does not grow on trees) but you also then have to sustain cheap fares and a decent quality through the state budget, mostly coming out of vital payments that could be going elsewhere, or coming out of more deficit spending (which im sure is what you'd like).

  * NatSci CS is half of the CS course - if you want to, you can switch to CS in your second year (but you'll work hard to catch up with the things you missed over the summer), so there's some extra flexibility there.
  * Most of the NatScis I speak to say the CompSci paper was a lot harder than they were expecting. Whether that's a good or bad thing is up to you.
  * There is a lot of maths in CS. Like a *lot*. The programming aspect isn't emphasised as much at Cambridge.

However, there are several approaches to this. There is the contractual test (Atomic Energy v Claydon) that asks what your contract says, and if it says your workplace can be any office/home, then one place's closure cannot give rise to redundancy. However, the more likely approach, given the circumstances, may be the factual test (Bass Leisure v Thomas) which can deem you redundant if you are forced to travel an extra 20 miles per day, as was the case in 'Bass Leisure', above. 

However, the maximum payment you can force for a redundancy is £13,920 as far as I'm aware, as it is calculated on a statutory basis which takes into account your age. It is of course open to your employer to pay you more, but it would a) be taxable and b) unlikely.

As another commenter has said, based on the refusal to allow a closer workplace, a breach of contract claim - specificly a breach of the mutual trust and confidence term - may apply and would be worth a lot more, but you wouldn't be getting a glowing reference as this would be a fairly serious lawsuit.

How is that different than now... great news is we have our own central bank. Sierously though that is a small figure given our actual budget is near the £700 billion mark each year and our bond rates even for short term debt is pretty low. If anything now is the time to spend more on long term projects that give a return because we can borrow the money cheaply.

Perhaps I'm a fool for Keynesian economic thinking but it does seem a waste of such cheap credit.

This was her go to response for all of her car crash interviews (Paxman, Neil, LBC etc). After the clip was played Neil then asked her a few  questions about how she will fund their commitments. She did her stuttering thing and then tried to dodge each of the questions by talking about how ideology is important and not cost etc. He kept asking her how much policies would cost she kept discussing ideology and morals without actually giving figures. The only figures I remember her giving were how they will bring in £25 billion from a wealth tax and raise the income tax to 60p. Neil asked her how that is going to work considering how all of the rich fled France when they raised the highest rate to 70p, let alone imposing a 2% wealth tax. She claimed that foreign examples aren't useful and that people are motivated by more than just money. 

It wasn't her worst interview by far but I wouldn't exactly call it successful.

Plus, I disagree that Pep's side were the ""ultimate"" Bielsa side, because what he did was use Bielsa's methods as a starting point, but had a much greater focus on possession.  Their play was a lot less direct, more of a hybrid between Cruff's Total Football and Bielsa's vertical, aggressive style.

Under Bielsa, you press hard to win back the ball quickly, but his tactics involve then a very quick pass forward to immediately transition from the defensive phase to the attacking.  Barcelona did this sometimes, but they would also be content to retain possession for dozens of passes, and then create an opening to strike.

So I don't think it's quite right to hold up them as an example, and even still, they did manage years at the top of European football, but eventually buckled under the sheer intensity of the work and volume of games.

I thought it went without saying that nuclear weapons would never be the first resort. 

&gt; Israel didn't threaten Egypt or Syria with nuclear annihilation in 1973

Why would they?  Israel's tiny collection of small nukes was intended to be used as a last resort.  If they'd used them offensively, they would have instantly lost all support from the West, including from the USA.

My point remains that we don't know what would happen if a nuclear power were on the verge of being conquered, because nobody has ever tried to invade a (known) nuclear power.  That's the crux of nuclear deterrent, but Ukraine gave that up.

But isn't this the case with every manager ever when they take a new job?  I mean, look around the Premier League... how many managers can honestly say they built their squad other than Wenger?

Your job as a manager is not to throw your toys out of the pram until Levy buys you new ones, it's to work with what you've got and take players who previously were under-utilised and find ways to inspire them.  Hell, even Tactics Tim has that figured out.

I think the problem we're seeing here is that Poch is too much of an ideologue, with such strict ideas that he's not willing to adapt for the greater good of the team.  The last time we had a young manager come in, play a rigid 4-2-3-1 formation with inverted wingers, alienate specific players, and over-rely on a handful of talented individuals to win games, we got AVB.

Hazard already has a free role but I can see him acting more as a shadow-striker to Remy. Willian will be forced to play deeper because of how effective United have been down their left hand side, and i'm playing Ramires over Oscar for stability. 

Mourinho probably won't go with this formation, as he will probably play a 4-3-3 with Zouma, Cesc and Matic in the 3 with Hazard, Willian and Remy up top.

people here get way too caught up in specific formations when in reality a proper formation doesn't exist in our game. If Zouma plays he will just be following Fellaini around, so there's not much point putting him in a set formation. Willian will inevitably be playing deeper than he normally would, so I stuck him next to Matic just for the sake of the diagram. You will all lose your shit because ""Chelsea don't play 4-4-2"" or whatever, but at times we very much do play with 2 blocks of 4. Ramires will most likely, if played, tuck in quite a lot to provide a bit of stability and steel to the middle of the park, but I put him in-front of Dave so that it is symmetrical. Hazard already has a free role so it doesn't matter where I put him in the diagram.

I agree that we need to focus on homegrown players, but we're hardly in the same situation as Chelsea or City where they're scrambling to get hold of those players. We have absolutely loads. 

Take a look at what would be a pretty standard XI for us:

Mignolet, Johnson, Lovren, Sakho, Moreno, Henderson, Allen, Coutinho, Lallana, Sturridge, Sterling. 

Only 3 of those 11 players were bought from clubs outside of England: Moreno, Sakho and Coutinho. 

Compare that to Arsenal's most recent XI: Ospina, Bellerin, Monreal, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Sanchez, Ramsey, Coquelin, Ozil, Cazorla, Giroud. 

There's a good representation of homegrown products there in Bellerin and Ramsey but none of the other players were bought from English clubs. They overpaid a bit for Sanchez and Ozil but if you look at their other attacking players, they paid about 15m for Cazorla and 9m for Giroud. 

Basically, my point is that Spain in particular is literally overflowing with players who do what Lallana does, and I have to wonder what that 25m spent on him would have fetched down there. It just seems like when we want a proven talent we look within the league but when we want potential we look without.

It will never move away from animal testing untill the results obtained through alternative testing are better then those obtained through animals.

Unfortunately this isnt going to happen in the forseeable future. People talk about alternatives but frankly put, nothing comes close in certain aspects of medical testing to those results obtained from animal testing.

For example, in Cancer research, we still dont understand a lot of the mechanisms in place, as such you cant test for something on a computer if you cant tell it what to look for. Animal testing allows us to locate these new pathways, often in mice , so that we can find them within human cells.

although /u/alexgmcm is right computers are far better, they can only tabulate for what we know and as such medical research is about discovering what we **dont** know",null,0,null,1429059916,null,0,false,0,cqcn53f,null,t3_32jsxq,null,t1_cqcn53f,null,t1_cqc6iup,null,null,null,1432395777,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

I agree with everything /u/AL85 said, but definitely not with that.  I know a lot of people who are big fans of the show, and none of them are toxic, nor are they mingin.  The people who are that way are simply the most vocal, and a lot of them signed the big petition that went around.  That was a million people, and I'll be generous and say there were twenty people for every one who signed the petition.  That's about 20 million people, which is less than 6% of the 350 million who watched the show.  

I'm willing the bet the actual number of awful people we keep seeing is a much smaller number than that though.  Most of us fans are perfectly nice people who enjoyed a show with three guys doing things with nice (or sometimes awful) cars.  You shouldn't let a small number of people become a generalization for the vast majority of the audience, who are perfectly reasonable people.  I really liked the three presenters, and I'm sorry they're gone.  But what Clarkson did should have gotten him fired, and it did.  I also don't like Sue all that much, but I definitely don't think she should have been treated like this.  A very loud and ignorant minority is not 'most' fans.

Y'know what's not nice? You.  People like you.  People who I've seen repeatedly lump most TG fans in with the mental cases because they think everyone who watches is a yobo.  

E: Maybe I'm being downvoted for the last paragraph, fine, apparently we don't like sarcasm here.  But I stand by the fact that most fans don't behave the way a tiny percentage have been acting on the internet.

So, some bunch of local activists who had written the letters Y, E and S in big letters on a beach were hailed as creative geniuses. Others were highlighted for running a particularly successful street stall.

Try to explain that four or five of you earning decent salaries share a house and they just stare blankly and dribble.

Local government thinks you are mentally disabled and are probably being forced to live in one room by an evil human-trafficking landlord. 

And remember the local elections a while back where one party had promised to include houses of 3 ppl under HMO regs? (Because fuck those noisy housesharers disrupting the neighbourhood of goodly state-approved family units).

Estate Agents just assume you're going to burn the place down but will happily take your money. So you cough up a reference fee and check-in and check-out fees for every single change of household. Ugh. At least you get your deposit back.

No, your best bet is private landlords but sadly they all seemed to be much harder to find since 2010ish (and the decline of brettward).

It goes without saying they have yet to replace Suarez, though, doesn't it?

null,false,ctp95,lfc55,,null,"Agreed. We probably overpaid for Lallana by about 7 or 8 million, but he was the captain of another Premiership team and a full England international, so I've generally chosen to see that 7 or 8m as a 'tax'. 

That does beg the question though, if you knew you were going to have to overpay for a certain player because of his current situation, why not look for another one? The continent would be where I would look, for the exact reason that you won't be paying that 'tax' for taking a good player from a rival. 

As for the non-England/English players you mentioned, I agree with you, but my point is more that that lot were bought for their promise and potential. Suarez obviously was a readymade player, but the rest of them were brought in with an eye to the future. 

Lallana and Lovren were clearly brought in to immediately improve the first team, which they haven't done. Why are we pissing away that kind of cash just because they've played in England? 45m for the pair of them, there are some great players in Europe who we could have made a run at for that kind of money. 

Another example, if you want to reach a bit further back, is Andy Carroll. 35m pounds at that time could have bought you some of the most talented players on the continent, but we bought that donkey largely because he was ""Premier League proven.""

Strong defensive mids are probably the last thing we needed, seeing as we had Bentaleb, Capoue and Dembele already established players ready to play that role. 

I want to believe in Levy most of the time, and I think his work is for the most part is great, but not only have we made some bad purchases, sometimes the type of player we buy already has enough competition as it is.

Dundee - well done on finishing top 6.  Unfortunately, we inherited this appallingly stupid post-split scenario which was designed only to ensure that Old Firm games were split 50/50 across a season.  We're really sorry about this, but built into this idiotic system is the idea that a club which over-achieves is punished with three trips to Celtic a season.  And don't even ask about revenue sharing, just don't.  Sorry, it sucks, but it was in the rules from the start.

Aberdeen - sorry, you're going to Parkhead for the third time this season.  Funny how that worked out, isn't it?

Any questions?  No?  Good.


Reckon I could have sorted it out in about 15 minutes.  The mind-blowing thing to me is that this is still going on.  Everyone knows the split is a farce, but no-one wants to do anything about it.  The truth is that the post-split fixtures are worked out at the start of the season, assuming that everyone will finish where they did last year - I'd suggest that Motherwell's position is more of an issue than Hamilton's, but I don't want to under-estimate the stupidity of those in charge.

Levy's reign is a funny one.  I mean, I started supporting Spurs in the Sugar era where finishing in the top half of the table and not boring the supporters to sleep was an achievement.  The best football I've seen us play, and the best results financially and on the pitch I've seen, have all come under Levy's stewardship.  He basically took a club that was sub-Newcastle in its success and ambition, and turned it into a perennial 4th-to-6th place side in the most competitive league in the world.  So I'm under no illusions about how hard that was.

But there's always that sneaking suspicion that we should've pushed on after that glorious season of UCL football.  With Ferguson retiring, Arsenal faltering, Liverpool going through a purgatory of their own, 4th place really was for the taking the last few years.

Instead of really going hell-for-leather in the transfer market and staking a serious claim on 4th, we tried to do it on a miser's budget, which was always gonna take a lot of luck to pull off.  We nearly did it, but there's just that slight regret that we pulled our punches when our opponents were against the ropes.

It's a shame, because now that Utd, Arsenal and Liverpool are resurgent again, it looks harder than ever to crack 4th.  It's gonna take some epic luck in the transfer market, a huge slice of luck on the pitch, and/or dare I say it, a better manager than Poch to actually get close to 4th next season.

My point is that with players like Baker, who're getting experience now and will return to the squad at the end of the season with some experience, the team should be looking at him, looking at the holes in the team and thinking of him as a viable option to plug those holes, not just a bit player or to loan out to someone else.

It's not necessarily about *better* players, it's about *different* players.  A lot of the players who aren't playing are actually really good at what they do, but what they do seems not to be what Pochettino wants. 

Capoue is an excellent player, but he's never been a pressing type of player nor had a high work rate, and his long passing out the wings clearly isn't what Pochettino wants from his deepest midfielder.  Soldado was an excellent player (and probably would be again in the right sort of team), but he has a particular skillset and way of playing that thrives on a completely different kind of service than our team provides, so he has never been the right player for us, nor we the right team for him.  Fazio captained and was the best CB in a Europa League-winning Sevilla side, but Pochettino has preferred to play Dier with his very different (but, objectively speaking, less-developed) skill set.  

Maybe Stambouli and Dembele, too.  Very good to excellent players at what they each do, but it's starting to look like they too might be in the ""not what the coach wants"" category.

It's really a hard ask looking for that kind of manager too. There's a lot of good ones in Spain (Valencia's, Bilbao's, I don't know if Villareal still has the same manager that had the second highest possession in a season but he would be great too), but I don't think we'll ever get a Klopp or a Simeone ready made for us. I think (and hope, really) that Levy is looking for his own Klopp or Simeone, but who knows. So we're left with young gambles (let's say, Vicenzo Montella, Thomas Tuchel and Frank de Boer) or big time managers who have nowhere else to go (can't really think of any, but let's say Rafa Benitez, Heynckes if he ever comes back to coaching and last season, LvG) and are looking for a final payday.

Refused is probably a strong word, but he still chose not to participate when he could have.  He even contemplated joining the 50th anniversary.  My statement is based on many articles but here is a selection -

&gt; As for Christopher Eccleston not being in the special, Moffat says, “I sort of knew that he wouldn’t. I know Chris a bit. I did a couple of meetings, and there was a moment, I suppose, a giddy moment where [I thought] ‘Would he actually do it?’ This wasn’t the kind of decision he took in a funk or that he was cross. He was very measured, very kind, very gentlemanly about it. He’s a good bloke. If you look at Chris’s career, this is not what he does. The Ninth Doctor turns up for the battle and not the party.”

http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2013/11/steven-moffat-talks-doctor-50th-ecclestons-absence/

Why was he having those meetings?  And what was the reasoning behind that decision? Moffat's last sentence implies that it wasn't about money or availability.

&gt; Naturally, Doctor Who fans would have been thrilled to get the somewhat brusk Time Lord back into the fold, but it’s also surprising that it got this close, as Eccleston (who will next be seen in Thor: The Dark World) hasn’t had the most cordial divorce from the series, previously going public with complaints about executives during his time on the show..... Now, the execs that Eccleston didn’t see eye to eye with are long gone from the the Doctor Who production team by now (but not the BBC), so maybe that explains Eccleston’s faded hesitancy.

The OP's article is noteworthy since he has mentioned he was proud of his work in the role, however he seems to have hated everything else to do with it.  His comments that he made on the July 2011 Master Acting Class goes into more specifics and is worth reading.

It would do well to solve inequality if we redistributed all the land - and forgot about capital. I'm going to go full Marx here, but if all land was governemnt owned and leased to citizens, the government would have a great asset base in which to borrow off - so we can enjoy the future today. Also, unproductive land, although leased to one person could be up for competitive tender to another person if the person isn't putting the land to good use. Eg, if someone was using their garden as a waste site someone else can put a business application in for the land, say to make allotment space - or simply a garden for someone who wants a garden. It would also get rid of uncompetitive rent setting - where landlords squeeze the profit out of companies - so our high streets may begin to repopulate. Basically, it would all those who produce surplus from the land to keep the profits without lazy landlords stealing what they make. It should also massively bring down the cost of starting a business. You make a business plan, and as long as it's likely to produce more than other bids for the same land you get money from the bank and you're away - no crazy, big risk rents, just straight in to trying to make your business work. Businesses could be created quickly, tested quickly - the quick-fail method. The method that makes US so successful. They create more businesses than anyone else, and have a lower chance of success. But to create real value only a few have to suceed to make up for the many failures. If after a set amount of time the business hasn't taken off, another bid is taken for the land.

Instead of a few rich individuals owning the land that is british, the people would own the land, and not only the people living today. It would be owned by future generations too and kept safe for them to enjoy in the future.

null,false,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,null,"I was actually in the Frank de Boer camp pretty heavily before we signed Poch.  We had made contact, he was interested, but ultimately it didn't happen for whatever reason.

Even though he's not a huge name in coaching like LVG or Klopp or the others, what I liked about him is that he's a *winner*.  He played for top clubs and won trophies, and now he's winning trophies and managing in the Champions League with Ajax.

I liked him because you don't play Barca or manage Ajax successfully for years without having a winning mentality.  Poch has done moderately well at the places he's coached, but he hasn't won anything.  And that winning mentality is everything... it's the difference between hiring Moyes - who did moderately well at a smallish club - to LVG, who knows exactly what it takes to succeed at the highest level.  That's the difference he brings to Utd, and it's now showing.

de Boer brings with him the knowledge of how a club like Barcelona works inside and out... Spurs doesn't represent the pinnacle of his experience to date, like it does for Poch.

I thought de Boer presented a good halfway point between the ruthless winning experience of some of the guys you mentioned, and the young guard like Poch, Martinez, etc.  He may well prove to be useless outside of Ajax, but I was sad to see that opportunity go.

Anyway, I'm certainly not for the sacking of anyway prematurely.  I just hope Poch can mature, learn from this season's mistakes, and give us a year of good football next term, even if we don't get 4th.",null,0,null,1429079064,null,0,1429090837,0,cqcwaz1,null,t3_32lisg,null,t1_cqcwaz1,null,t1_cqctfcc,null,null,null,1432400166,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

Moreno is young enough to be coached, and a good coach can make all the difference to a player's development. Boateng was seen as a so so player when he was at Man City, then at Bayern and under Guardiola he's become one of the undisputed defenders around. Not saying that Rodgers is Guardiola (I wish!) but Rodgers seems willing to work with the lad, and Moreno, bless him, seems willing to learn. I wish he'd get over the Spanish habit of giving 75 minutes to a match and then going absent in the last 15 minutes, because in the PL, we play to the whistle, but again, Moreno is realising that.

It's pretty clear that management is as much or more about player psychology and motivation as it is about tactics, which is why Utd can win the title under Ferguson, and then pretty much the exact same group of players fail royally under Moyes.  Sometimes the quality and ""fit"" of the players isn't as important as how you gee them up and work with them.

And besides, Poch did bring in a bunch of players in the summer... and then proceeded to ignore or alienate all of them except Dier, who I don't think anyone bought expecting him to start much this season.  He's ended up starting more due to default than him being undroppable.

The best coaches to me are the ones that take all the random pieces in front of them, and figure out how to get the best out of them.  Playing a rigid 4-2-3-1 with inverted wingers has hardly looked like working for us all season, and yet Poch's still doing it.  That doesn't speak to me of a manager who knows how to work with what he's got... it feels more like someone with fairly inflexible ideas about the game, waiting for the pieces to finally line up instead of going out and working with what he has in front of him.",null,0,null,1429079647,null,0,false,0,cqcwh3l,null,t3_32k44w,null,t1_cqcwh3l,null,t1_cqct9pe,null,null,null,1432400246,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

Likewise, decent established players (who aren't great, and therefore may question whether they would play enough) would probably overlook us. Bigger teams don't have this problem; look at Chelsea. They have the money to tempt players, even when they know they're not going to play much. They literally have like (at least) 12 players out on loan who would challenge for a place in our 'second' team. Our main draw for those fringe players is undoubtedly the fact they may play in Europe, and have the possibility of winning a competition which is relatively prestigious.

To look at it another way, what's the point of aspiring for the Champions League when we can't even handle playing in the Europa? We've struggled against some really mediocre teams. But they think that missing out on Europa (whereby most players would consider us in the same league as teams like West Ham, Swansea etc - i.e, not that attractive) and we'd suddenly propel ourselves into a Champions League spot?

Again Russia would only ever annex part of Romania at the end of a second cold war. They didn't roll tanks into West Berlin for the same reason they wouldn't annex Romania the second time round.

That argument would make sense if France and the UK had anything like the nuclear capacity of America.

The idea of consensus government has one flaw, because it tries to drag everyone to the middle it can be hard to differentiate yourself from the rest of the executive, especially when most of the gritty stuff happens in committee where nobody outside really pays attention.

[His speech at our spring conference](http://youtu.be/wnH5y7v_ShU) gives a bit of detail of where we are different.

On account of getting into bed with the DUP, there is a certain amount of pragmatism that has to be considered, we know returning less Unionists overall to Westminster makes our position look weaker, which doesn't help our prospects for support from Westminster and does have an effect on morale. 

However there is one thing we are certain of the people who vote DUP vote and we do have to persuade a number of those back to us, and those people that don't vote, for whatever reason, aren't going to unless we can demonstrate we are a viable alternative, and to effectively do that we need to have more representatives doing more of the work they're doing.

I also take a bit of an issue of the idea we are moving towards the DUP, when in practice it's the other way about. McGimpsy's ""best health budget in the western world"" (or words to that effect, Peter Robinson) didn't seem so great when a DUP minister was getting the blame, apprenticeships is another area, the shrine at the maze site, and there's the practical issue of accepting power sharing. 

Then there's the very snide and duplicitous attitude of many in the DUP, and this really winds me up. The things they said to and about Colin McCusker for doing a deal for mayor with Sinn Fein, after the DUP wouldn't do one and when the DUP knew they'd do the exact same on the new councils across the country the next year just isn't right.",null,0,null,1429083597,null,0,false,0,cqcxiqg,null,t3_32kwl7,null,t1_cqcxiqg,null,t1_cqclvho,null,null,null,1432400739,null,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1,null

&gt; What a ridiculous law if it can be extended to the situation the OP mentioned.

It *can* be extended, but in this case it wasn't. 

For example, say you lived next to a children's playground and didn't have a fence and child-proof gate around your pool.  You should know that it's possible (even likely) for a child to wander onto your property and drown in your pool.  It doesn't matter that the kids shouldn't be there.  The fact that you know it might happen and chose not to take reasonable measures to prevent it makes it *negligence* and/or *reckless endangerment* (depending on where you live).

&gt;  if a criminal comes in, swims in it and drowns while I am abroad then could I be liable?

It's possible, but unlikely (unless you're in the US).  Scotland has a *reckless endangerment* law which covers this, but the rest of the UK doesn't as far as I can google.  I'm guessing that this case came down to proving *negligence* on the part of the council.

&gt; Judge Main said more could have been done to address the issue of trespassers gaining access to the school site. In his decision the judge said the school had taken ""reasonable measures"" to shore up security. He added: ""There were few measures, reasonably achievable within the likely school budget, it could have taken, to prevent all acts of trespass outside school hours.

So the school recognised the fact that trespassers were likely to enter the property and took reasonable measures to prevent it (but could have done a bit more).  Not at fault.

Getting back to your example, if it was likely that trespassers would enter your property while you were away and you didn't take reasonable measures to prevent them from accessing the pool, using the pool, drowning in the pool, or whatever, then yes, you could be at fault.  

But if you have a fence, locked gate, PIR security lighting (so an intruder can see the pool and not fall in accidentally), then you've taken reasonable measures to prevent any such tragedy and probably wouldn't be at fault.

Transition would largely be a political problem, some will lose their power at the expense of many gaining power. Could get messy. The banking sector is the most interesting part though. Fundamentally banks turn potentially profitable ideas in to money, give that money and hope the bet pays off. People come up with ideas and get a loan and hope the bet pays off. If there was less option to turn money into power, through land/property to rents, individual wealth becomes less important. But also, there's nothing inherent about money that the bank needs. It has lots of capital because it needs to be stable and to be able to sustain shocks. The government in my thought experient holds all the land, so could under write any loan, the govenmments balance sheet would be safe enough to absorb a large amount of risk. Loans would be dealt with in the same way, by bank managers and business experts appraising ideas. In the sense that the banks/governments profit will be reinvested or strategically places, banks would become nonprofit so money won't be wasted when they aren't lending. Competition could be introduced by comparison to other countries systems - but I have no doubt my system will bring in all the £££ for the country.

I was going to solve corruption in the process with a perfect governemnt fallacy.. Transparent system, independence or a framework that keeps politicans away from monopolising power or regulators/bank managers away from capture. Concentration of wealth would be inherently suspecious anyway. Not that no one will be rich, loads of people will be rich, just that if a group or individual are way out ahead, there a chance they've cheated the system so journalists will start to poke around and the empowered people will get their pitchforks.

Of the various systems they investigated, STV was the only one that was truly proportional, and it was rejected due to the idea that A) it was exceedingly complex, B)it would require constituencies of ~350,000 voters, C) the ballot paper would have so many candidates and require so many crosses/ordering to be done so as to be an ""oppressive degree of choice"" and D) because it was a different voting system to that used for devolved governments, the London Assembly and the European Parliament

Honestly, I don't think STV is the ideal system to use, it's extremely good in places like Northern Ireland and would be good in a country like Bosnia-Herzegovina where ethnic/religious differences are a big deal, but in the UK I think it would be unnecessary. There's a variety of Proportional Representation systems used in Europe that would be much simpler to count, much simpler to use, and wouldn't require massive restructuring of constituencies.

&gt;The notion of tax flight “is almost entirely bogus — it’s a myth,” said Jon Shure, director of state fiscal studies at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit research group in Washington. “The anecdotal coverage makes it seem like people are leaving in droves because of high taxes. They’re not. There are a lot of low-tax states, and you don’t see millionaires flocking there.”",null,0,null,1429085273,null,0,1429091466,0,cqcxx1s,null,t3_32l6ye,null,t1_cqcxx1s,null,t1_cqcleoc,null,null,null,1432400925,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,BigRedS,cnty-uk,London,null,"&gt;&gt; assuming the blame lies one way or the other

&gt; While the old ""innocent until proven etc."" line might hold, a major problem we have at the moment is that the blame seems to be very firmly planted in the other direction. Wanting that to change doesn't mean assuming the a lorry driver must be assumed to be at fault, rather the narrative needs to shift away from all that I mentioned above (""Was the cyclist wearing a helmet?"" etc.)

I think that depends on the media. There's little in the form of strong support for lorries in London, but there's *lots* of pro-cycling press that can't quite see why they're not simply banned from built-up areas. I think there's more reporting of the form ""cyclist not wearing elbow-pads dies"" than ""lorry kills cyclist"", but I don't think it's universally one-way.

&gt;&gt;probably including both lorry drivers turning without looking and cyclist filtering up alongside them.

&gt;The trouble is... one of those is (I think?) illegal, or may result in a conviction due to consequences which could occur, while the other should be considered expected behaviour. At least there's no law against it and it's what cyclists are going to do to get to the front at lights (where the box is).

Well, filtering's legal in the same way as overtaking is - it's almost always more dangerous than not doing it, but the person doing it is expected to have weiged up the risks and only done it where it's safe, and in a way that's safe. I like to think there's not many people who'd say filtering up alongside a lorry indicating to turn is remotely safe.

Personally, I think filtering down the side of a lorry is always more dangerous than I'd like, so I'll always wait (but increasingly when I'm filtering I'm doing it with an engine and it's *far* easier to sit and wait and then get going again on a motorbike than a bicycle). It's not unlike simply not overtaking on a winding road despite probably having the torque to be able to get round that vehicle and the braking to probably make the corner, or simply driving at 35 in a 50 because 30's the more appropriate speed.

I think the ""but filtering is legal!"" argument is part of the problem here - capital-C cyclists seem to view it as some inalienable right (I'm not saying you are) and that all drivers are expected to simply assume that, regardless of anything else to do with the situation, there may well be a line of cyclists up both the left side and the right side of the vehicle and that they need to simply deal with it because Cyclists. Personally, that's the bit of roadcraft that most scares me about Cyclists, hugely more than any absence of lights, weaving without looking or RLJing (which I quite like, what with often being on a motorbike), because it seems so daft to do dangerous things simply on the principle that everyone else really ought to be looking out for you because you're the vulnerable one.",null,0,null,1429085331,null,0,false,0,cqcxxiy,null,t3_3206hm,null,t1_cqcxxiy,null,t1_cqca79a,null,null,null,1432400931,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Now you're being deliberately obfuscating. You know as well as I do that singling out one person for racist behaviour in a crowd of thousands is damn-near impossible. If you want evidence that racist football fans are still under the scrutiny of the law then maybe you ought to cast your mind back to a month or so ago when the papers ran a story about a group of white football fans chanting racist songs on an underground train while prevending a black dude from getting on. Oh, and one of them was still identified and fired.

&gt;Not to mention all the times you encounter at work, socially, etc.

Go up to one of your ethnic co-workers and call them something racist if you're confident you won't be punished for it. As for socially, it's not on you to punish your friends or family for racism. Fortunately there are better ways, I prefer the method of simply acting like I don't get the joke and have them explain it to me. In minute, agonising, awkward detail.

That doesn't make the act any less significant. I'm guessing he's the first Royal to dress as a Nazi for fancy dress.

and why not? He knows he's in the public eye.

It counts in the sense that I referred to it - as an example of a nuclear country not threatening to use nukes, even when facing conventional attack.

&gt; Britain during the Falklands War also doesn't count, because the British homeland was never in any sort of danger, rather merely a remote colony half a world away. 

This is a very convenient line in the sand you have drawn, allowing you to continue to claim that a nuclear power has never been invaded. The fact remains that British territory was invaded and occupied, and Britain deployed the entire armed forces, but never hinted at use of nuclear weapons. Why is that? And why did Argentina, a non nuclear country, feel so confident that we wouldn't threaten nukes?

The third example, is Iraq attacking Israel during the first gulf war. There was no doubt in 91 that Israel had nukes. Why didn't that deter Iraq from firing scud missiles at Israeli cities?

&gt; do you really think that Russia would have sent its troops into eastern Ukraine if they weren't confident that Ukraine couldn't do anything effective in response?

Yes. Russia has always been happy to take calculated risks and losses, especially to secure a position as strategically important as Crimea, the only Russian presence on European seas,  and where their navy is based. Do you really think Ukraine would have used nukes in response to the invasion of Ukraine? What do you think the western response to this escalation would have been?

The high turnover is a bit of a myth really, as that is often due to there being students there who see it as a bit of cash on the side whilst concentrating on studying/ applying for full time work. I wouldn't worry about it like I would in sales. It's in no way cut throat like that. If you were struggling, you'd go through a long process before ultimately being sacked, so you'd at least be in a job for a while as long as you aren't a complete idiot/nasty person.

I found it was a fairly low stress but boring role for the most part. Whoever was on shift was the main factor as to whether you had a good day or not. Still got some great friends from my days there. I'd say I preferred the small store to the big one as I got to know most people there and see a more varied work load.

Whilst the pay isn't amazing, it's fairly stable and fair to the job you are in. The corporate bullshit is there but as long as you muck in and do your job, you can ignore all that and just get on with earning your wage.

For instance, the idea that there should be a new Muslim empire, the idea that what we do in this life pales into significance with the rewards in the next or the idea that the West is decadent and evil.

And let's be honest here - to an extent, these ideas are, in some form or the other, part of *mainstream* Islam.  Of course, only a minority of muslims support ISIS-style tactics, but there's no hard and fast distinction between the theology of the extremists and that of the 'moderates'.  After all, the British youths running off to Syria are often from quite moderate Muslim families.

So what can we do?  We can't just bomb these ideas from the meme-pool and it would require an act of genocide to kill every muslim around the world who harbors a grievance against us.

I personally think that our key tactic should be to encourage a reform in Islam.  That means no more pretending that Islam, in its current state, is a harmless or peaceful religion.  Instead we actually have to tackle these ideas head on.  We have to subject even mainstream Islam to the same level of scrutiny to which we subject all ideas and we need to stop tiptoeing around for fear of causing offense.

Arsenal's youth team played a League One team last season, and were eviscerated. Our propensity for youth products in other, less established leagues (relative to the Prem), may be disappointing, but it's not the fallacy it's made out to be when you consider the relatively low level of football the kids have been playing at.

- I personally think Mourinho is under supreme pressure to deliver a Premier League title this year. If, under incredible circumstances, we lose out this season, the possibility his post remains untenable is very, very high. His pragmatism probably reigns supreme, hence the dearth of opportunities to both youth players and certain squad players alike. Isuspect, come next season, he'll be a little more willing to field youth across the board. Not that he'll ever reach Guardiola/Wenger levels of propensity for youth players.

- It's not a popular view on here, but I do understand his reluctance to trust youth in the league; I thought preparing to bring Zouma on instead of Brown was the right decision. What if Brown had made his senior debut and missed a sitter? How would that affect him mentally? Mourinho's spoken repeatedly of the pressure precluding him from playing youth this year, and I'm inclined to agree with him. That being said, I think they should have earned more opportunities in dead-rubber games. I can't fathom why we'd only give 8 minutes to RLC in a game that was fundamentally meaningless from kick-off.",null,0,null,1429088944,null,0,1429089315,0,cqcyqa5,null,t3_32n49r,null,t1_cqcyqa5,null,t3_32n49r,null,null,null,1432401308,null,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3,null

What helps is that I saved up while living with my mum and bought a house as soon as I could. Managed to rent the spare room out and my GF now lives with me, so I effectively see an extra £450-500 a month which helps massively and has allowed me to save for a few months off travelling in 2017!

One bit of advice. Don't be too proud to live with other people. I have seen people think they like the idea of living alone but factor in all them bills, council tax, broadband, sky tv if you want that. It barely becomes sustainable in most jobs when you're spending up to £1-£1.5k on just monthly outgoings. Try limit your direct debits to what you really need. You will appreciate the flexibility with your disposable income.

The one gripe i personally have is my long commute and running a two car household as my GF works a drive away as well so I'm considering looking at alternatives closer to home or within public transport distance.

Most contracts combine the cost of the tariff and the handset. But it’s not normally split out like that, so people don’t know how much each element costs or when they’ve finished paying for their phone. If you don’t switch as soon as your contract has ended it could end up costing you around £22 for every month you go over.

O2, Virgin Media, Tesco Mobile and Utility Warehouse have tariffs where the handset and airtime costs are separate, while giffgaff has never bundled the handset in. Whereas Vodafone, EE and Three customers still continue to be charged one bundled price.

We think people are being misled, so we’re calling on all providers to separate out the cost of the handset so you don’t continue to pay after your contract comes to an end!

The Muslim community has no intention of integrating with the christian natives. This was highlighted in the light of pastor McConnels comments with the request for a dedicated Muslim ""community"" centre. In fact according to Quarnic scripture Christians and Jews are unclean and should not be associated with. Its no surprise that Jews view Christians the same way, given that the Qur'an is basically a plagiarism of various religious texts (inc Jewish). If a Muslim wants to marry outside their faith, their partner must become Muslim. That is a requirement of their faith. 
The UKIP position on immigration is that we should adopt an approach like Canada or Australia. People with skills we require may come and contribute to society. Not open the door to millions of unskilled labourers from countries were the minimum wage is a quarter of our own. The current policy has seen wages for unskilled workers plummet through the exploitation of cheap labour.
You may not see the issue with this, like the westminster elite you are perhaps not unskilled. But unlike immigrants, unskilled workers here with families cant live in a house with six other people to keep costs down. They have to suffer the fall in wages with no way to offset them. Perhaps you would argue peoples wage demands were to high and this is part of the economy rebalanacing. 
Its cool and edgy to chuck mud at UKIP, ignoring the racist and homophobic mp's from labour and the tories. The fact remains that Farage beat everyone in the leaders debate bar Sturgeon. He was the only one who said anything of substance, whilst millipede and Cameron just looked totally clueless as per usual.

Cech, despite being perfect at every other significant aspect of a keeper, has always struggled in that department, even at his absolute peak. However, I think Cech is better on 1 on 1 situations and distribution. Luckily those aspects aren't too big of a deal and Courtois is still very, very young so he can possibly overcome that.

* Having the best overall team doesn't mean you have the best players, it just means you have a better average of players than other academies

* Success at youth level doesn't always translate to senior level, for example England generally perform well and win things at youth level and then do nothing at senior level. A big reason for this is that physique and strength counts for a lot more at youth level when your opponents haven't developed fully than it does at senior level when it's a more even playing field. England succeed at youth because they focus their players on old fashioned conditioning to be strong and fit rather than on tactics and technique. Not saying the same is necessarily true of our kids but it's just an example.

The other reason for having our own human rights act is because EU human rights law isn't entirely compliant with existing UK law, a topical example at the moment is the conflict with the public health act, one says we can enforce a quarantine where as the other says we can't which could cause problems if someone was stupid enough to refuse treatment and quarantine for something like Ebola.

First source, for example, means that lots have no strong opinions on Al Qaeda, but similarly, many in the countries where extremism is a problem are genuinely worried about it. Ditto for Taliban. 

Next source is literally a blogger putting spin on a poll which may or may not exist, because all links to it redirect to a 404 page for a company called Clout, when the blog claims they're called Wenzel Strategies. However, the blog doesn't actually link to this, it links to another 'interpretative' article by a website called World Net Daily that ""that publishes news and associated content from the perspective of U.S. conservatives and the political right.""

Next link - Telegraph. From 2006, and covers many bases, including how many Muslims feel alienated from Britain (can't imagine why) and how ""a fifth have sympathy with the ""feelings and motives"" of the suicide bombers who attacked London. Impossible to comment on because it lacks an actual study.

Next point is the same site as the first, again, who cherry pick statistics. ""Hezbollah receive positive ratings..."" if you frame them as freedom fighters against the oppressive Israeli state, then I guess you could get that spin. From 2010.

Next source, quoting a commentary from someone else, who is interpreting a social science study. 

Next, from 2009, citing the same source as the first one. Conservative bias. 

It goes on in this way, expecting nobody to want to try to refute anything they say from the sheer amount of shit they throw. Similarly, a huge wall of text with the heading ""why islam sucks"" gives any reader the sense that 'holy shit that's a lot of evidence', when really they're quoting pretty much the same website, the same source from late 2000s.

- Immigration from Muslim countries is already massively restricted. Most new Muslims in Britain are born here, or come from other ""non-Muslim"" countries like France.

- Stop funding extremist groups: that's already happening but maybe needs to be stepped up

- Shut down extremist mosques: that's already happening but again maybe needs to be stepped up

He is receptive to arguments that would suggest, at the end of his time, that he was *not* the best manager of all time. One could be the fact that he has not done exactly what I have posited - the sustained reinvention of a club's footballing culture. The closest he has gotten to that, so far, has been with the Chelsea team that had a particular identity for a decade. Perhaps in the future, he will want to claim that Mourinho's Chelsea has effectively lasted through both of his stints *and* the interim period. That would be significant. 

He has a mandate though. He must win (never mind the 'youth' zealots who want him to field completely inexperienced players in must-win games).

This is the problem I have, we have a weapon we can use to retaliate to a nuclear strike, but by that stage, the only people who aren't ash are the people on the submarines. Or we could use it for a pre-emptive strike, which would almost certainly lead to escalation as well.

When a new immigrant family or any family moves in to a house down the road, do you go around with cakes and welcome them to the neighbourhood? Of course not, that's weird but how else are we going to make them feel welcome at personal level?

All we do is complain that they don't integrate with local community but we need to to integrate them on a personal level like that, no? You going down to pub to watch football? Invite them as well. It's hard enough being the new guy in a new surrounding. If nobody makes an effort it's obvious that they're going to stick to themselves.

You see similar behaviour from English immigrants abroad as well. They do tend to have their own community where they hang out with other English speakers because it's easier to communicate. 

I suppose what I'm trying to say is, we need to become more personal. Get to know our neighbours, have a community event and include them as well and integrate them to British culture that way.

I could go into details of different scenarios, and while it is obviously impossible to predict every situation, any nuclear attack on or by the UK by anything other than a terrorist organisation (who would not be deterred by Trident II anyway) would almost certainly result in escalation.

OK but this puts a massive amount of trust in NATO and the US. This essentially locks us in to following them in everything they do from now on, because without our own independent deterrent we would have no option but to remain in the alliance regardless of what that means.

If it would simply be a case of quickly reviving the technology that wouldn't be such a big deal... but it isn't. This attitude would make us beholden to NATO. It would also make us a junior partner, with less influence.

&gt;I would much rather we used the money on a last-resort missile shield. We get a tool, rather than a weapon, that increases UK security which can be truly independent.

I see this a bit like building a big moat around your castle, and then finally when your enemy comes to lay siege and starve you out, you sit there thinking ""fuck, I really wish we had an offensive weapon here"", guess we just have to wait until the food runs out.

The middle classes have historically been seen as those who have a middling standard of living, somewhere between the working classes who lived hand to mouth and the elite who had a say in how the country was run. Since the French Revolution the term 'bourgeoisie' has been used because they represented the middle class so visually in that time period. Caricatures if you will.

And as someone with a Masters degree in Social and Cultural Anthropology, I have to say that methodology of using the median income as a benchmark to work out the middle classes would be wrong even if it were so lamentably off the mark.

There are now considered to be seven classes in British society, with the middle classes still conventionally being seen as those who have high social and cultural capital, regardless of financial stakes. So your accusation of 'fuzziness' is completely irrelevant. There's more than one way to skin a cat. If you can come up with objective, beyond-dispute measures of cultural and social capital I'm all ears. I'll even get in touch with my old professor at the Sorbonne and get you a viva. Greatness awaits.

Do I sound middle class to you? I speak two languages, I've got two degrees, I work in London, I'm one of four, and I married at 25 and we were parents before we turned 30.

Now consider that, even with meticulous data scrubbing of my own family finances [tally-ho!], my 'disposable income' is &lt;£100 at the end of the month (every one of which is tight and we count the days until payday) and I've got less than £4k in the bank at any one time. The residence we live in is routinely burgled and has a reputation for being a good place to score some weed (from my neighbour Luke, by the way). I also bought a beaten up old car for a grand the other month because I drove my old 3 door Corsa into the ground with 120,000 miles. Do I still sound middle class? Because by your definitions of single income I'm probably somewhere in the upper classes.

So where does my middle class start? I don't think it's purely about income, but if I'll humour your fascinating measure of the Great British class system and put it at around £50k combined household income. £21k single income is absolutely nowhere near middle class. It is dependent on both adults in the family earning that amount, which would put there combined household take-home pay at about £2,800 a month, which is obviously a good amount of money for anyone to live on. But again you're relying on 'fuzzy' cultural definitions of relationship status in order for your calculation to check out as Middle Class. Quelle audace.

Additionally, your attempt to accuse me of swerving while stating, ""I know my upper class doesn't start at that figure, but your middle class doesn't start at any figure,"" isn't only swerving, it's also pretty juvenile.

And as to your ditty about the ""squeezed middle"" being a daft phrase, it wasn't the champion of the middle classes who came up with that. That was Ed trying to build political and social dialogue with the middle classes. And last I checked, people earning as little as £21k a year don't exactly vote for Old Etonians.",null,0,null,1429093675,null,0,false,0,cqczq38,null,t3_32jwfu,null,t1_cqczq38,null,t1_cqcyir2,null,null,null,1432401777,null,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3,null

This is Reddit, I could claim to have a 13 inch penis and be an internationally recognised expert of economics for all it could be proven or all the relevance it has. The problem here is that your argument is bollocks.

You are taking the distribution of taxation, something which is predicated on numbers and statistical distribution, and trying to somehow shoehorn ""cultural and social capital"" into this. It doesn't go. Square peg, round hole. All you are proving is my point that ""middle class"" is not a descriptor of the economic middle, and furthermore that that cultural and social capital is completely and totally detached from the economics of the situation. Cultural and social capital is totally and utterly irrelevant to taxation and economics.

My point, through all of this, is that talking about the ""squeezed middle classes"" is bollocks because a) the middle class does not actually exist as an economic construct, and that by any definition of middle income this group is not being squeezed very much at all and b) trying to shoehorn what you admit yourself is a social construct into hard numbers just has the effect of shifting what is seen as the ""middle"", the average, towards greater income and wealth in perception. You have done absolutely nothing to contradict this and have in fact reinforced it. 

I have not relied upon any ""fuzzy"" cultural definitions. You're the one who is doing that in an attempt to fit square pegs into round holes. You also don't get to mention relationships at all, because again we are talking about taxation, which is applied individually, not per household - so a household with two median earners is still being relatively left alone.

Essentially, you don't have an financial definition of ""middle class"" because there isn't one, but  you are claiming this group is somehow being over taxed anyway, based on a supposition of middle class which doesn't actually relate to any numbers or income distribution. I've proposed a definition of the middle which actually tallies with what the average is, the actual middle, the one that is being left well enough alone, and you have refused it - possibly because your argument - and your attempt to somehow portray people much better off than the average as somehow the average -  then falls apart.",null,0,null,1429094672,null,0,false,0,cqczy0p,null,t3_32jwfu,null,t1_cqczy0p,null,t1_cqczq38,null,null,null,1432401881,null,0,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,0,null

Double cleansing is a personal thing, depends on your skin and your products. I don't even double cleanse with make up or sunscreen but I am careful with my single cleanse.

Some use a make up remover (eg. wipes) which are not super effective and then a different cleanser, does not have to be an oil although IMO oils are worth trying just to see if they work for you.

They included a quote of what she said:

""I would say, in answer to your question, there are issues surrounding early diagnosis. We need to make teachers, health professionals - lawyers, even - police officers, all aware of key mental health issues in the community. You touched on diagnosis levels and people waiting in custody without getting the treatment they need. I've had to deal with people in those situations. I'm not trained to deal with people in those situations. I would like to see more training for legal professionals and police officers. **Maybe it's something as simple as there are certain conditions which are more common, where people can wear a wristband to identify they have that condition, so that then we can perhaps, not diagnose, but spot it earlier and ensure that we deal with it.** There are a variety of measures that we need to look at. Of course we need to work together – there are going to be people with much better ideas, and we want to hear those ideas as to how we can spot and help those with mental health issues, and perhaps train-up our teachers in schools as well to stop the issue from occurring. We have a huge problem in Cambridge. We were all at the National Austistic Society hustings recently, and we have huge problems in Cambridge around the early diagnosis of autism. It is about awareness and educating people so that we can spot this – and providing the funding as well. All these things cost money. Ultimately it comes down education, awareness and funding. I know we've said all this, but we now have the fastest growing economy in Europe. The reason why we have come up with our statement on the £8 billion extra for the National Health Service is that we are confident the economy will continue to grow as it has, so that we can provide more money. Ultimately, public sector services require money. It is that simple.""

Odds are remortgaging will be your best bet.  If you go for a simple remortgage you'll be looking at 90% LTV mortgages since help to buy only applies to first time buyers.  These will have higher rates than the 75% LTV mortgage you started out with, but lower than the typical variable rate.  I'm not sure how the staircase works, but odds are that will give you a lower interest rate.

One thing to consider is that Help to Buy mortgages will not let you move out and let the house.  If you're planning on moving out before the end of your fixed term then you might be better off with the simple remortgage.  Typical mortgages will not let you let the house (there are special buy to let mortgages) but banks will have some flexibility in letting you switch mortgage types mid-way through your term.  They cannot do this with Help to Buy mortgages due to government restrictions.

null,false,hotcod,null,null,null,"Yes at some point some one has to decide but the ECHR is agreement between all the signed nations to be bound to a set of basic rights that everyone gets. The point of doing this is to ensure that any given government of any given signatory nation can't quickly or easily change that agreement. Either changes would have to agreed or you have to leave and this acts in a number of ways to dampen reactionary policy. 

Which brings us to your next point which is honestly a little disingenuous because that's not the point I, or most people are making. By and large I wouldn't expect fewer or even honestly diffrent rights to the ones we have because it's the issue of who is granted those rights that is at stake. 

The Tories have made no secret out of the fact that they want to be able to strip them from given people as they see fit which does not make them human rights it makes them the rights what ever the current government thinks you should have. If you agree that should be the case that is a valid view but throws the concept of *human* rights out the window. The least you could do is be honest about the fact that you don't care. 

As for being entirely compliant with our laws? That's not a bug, it's a feature and honestly expecting us, or any one else to be totally compliant with all their international obligations is to ignore complex realities. Sometimes we'll need to go to the international court, sometimes we won't because no one is pressing the issue to those courts but those courts always exist as a recourse for a citizen independent of their government or nation and I personally think that is hugely valuable. 

Which is all to say we agreed that there are some rights that should belong to us as humans and that no given incarnation of a nations government can quickly or easily take them away from you. Placing those rights with in UK law with the express purpose of allowing our government to remove those human rights from given classes of people largely defeats the point of them.

The customer has to compare *x*+*y* X *z* for each deal , including if they decide to buy the phone outright and go SIM-only, in which case *x* is very large and *z* is presumably set the same as the other deals for comparison purposes, but then that still doesn't compare non-numerical concerns like the advantages of not being locked into a contract and the disadvantages of needing the money up front.  I genuinely don't see how an arbitrary split of the monthly costs helps.

For example, let's say EE offers a new phone for £40 a month for two years, and says that £20 a month of that is for paying for the handset, because they buy the phone off the manufacturer for £480.  Let's say O2 offer the exact same phone and exact same contract details, but they say £25 a month is the split for the phone, because the RRP of the phone is £600.

Had Moffat decided to write McGann in the role instead (and not messed up the regeneration numbers in the process), I wonder whether Eccleston would've agreed to appear alongside McGann, Tennant and Smith in his own storyline.

Its really good to have your feedback as this show is in its first iteration so is pretty far away from any degree of polish. I want to hear opinions like yours.

I am surprised you didn't like the cat viral photo joke however. For the record, I'm saying that the predictability of major journos over-reporting The Cat is astounding. It's an utterly cynical reaction to the popularity of #TheDress and they should of course be reporting on more important things. BUT, point taken, I should be leading the way in this regard by focusing on more important issues.

As for actually addressing the Syrian civil war myself, I want to but its likely I would fail spectacularly. Unfortunately, (and I know this will come as a MASSIVE shock to you) my comic skills are far too underdeveloped to work with that kind of material. I would come off as heinously insensitive.

They seem a bit of an angry bunch.  Not in the passionate way that UKIP are, but they don't seem very PR friendly in their anger.  They could do to cheer up a bit and stop being quite so paranoid.

I have no problem with gay marriage and am quite socially liberal in general, have no particular opinion of abortion, think that Sinn Féin are murderers (and I think that it doesn't say much good about nationalists that they vote for them - I don't think the DUP makes unionists look good in that the DUP seem quite un-British, but that's democracy for you either way) and believe that they have a long way to go for me to revise that opinion.  Perhaps in another couple of decades my opinion will change about SF.

I am a Unionist.  I love seeing the Union Jack flying (and hate seeing tattered Union Jacks whenever I'm in Northern Ireland), but I also believe in democracy.  The flag protesters were anti-democratic in what they tried to do, so whilst I can see where they were coming from I ultimately turned against them.   As councils across the UK do designated days, that's what I would be happy with seeing on Belfast City Hall. Seeing the mixture of comical and far-right figures like Jamie Bryson and that idiot Jim Dowson at the head of the flag protest did them a lot of damage I feel.

I think the other point to the TUV is that they seem very parochial and provincial, and like other Ulster parties don't seem to put much focus on reaching out to the rest of the UK. I don't like Stormont and I think I would either go towards abolishing the damn thing and having direct rule or at least having an opposition - there isn't one at present.

You must be familiar with the concept of *Mutually Assured Destruction* given your degree? The reason you hold a deterrent is not to use it, but to ensure nobody uses their own deterrents offensively. Without such a deterrent, in theory your enemies could launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike and face very few (if any) consequences. In the case of the UK, NATO would obviously have something to say about that, but is it worth the risk? How long can alliances last in an ever shifting geopolitical landscape?

The 2012 HMRC assessment said the high tax rate made the UK a ""less attractive place to start, finance and grow a business"".
Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said bringing back the 50p rate would be an ""unmitigated disaster for Britain"".
Mark Littlewood, director general at the Institute of Economic Affairs, echoed that view, saying it would be a ""disaster for both enterprise and economic growth"".

I mean, you're right, they are appealing to a sentiment that already existed and to an extent has been exaggerated due to the anger and frustration people are feeling in the current economic climate. But I don't think it helps that islamophobia is becoming normalised and encouraged by a rising political party. People are being told that immigrants and Muslims are the cause of all their problems, and that to fix these problems you must vote for their political party.

They don't break down normally. But some mishap is to be expected in a service life of decades. There are even enemies who might do it intentionally! who would have thought!?

&gt; If the one at sea breaks down, it's one of the ones currently being used for training which is sent out.

OK I read up on this. Your suggestion would mean that they have to train at sea constantly for the whole duration of the duty sub's patrol because there always needs to be backup ready. This makes it hard to change crews as necessary, not to mention train for going in and out of port safely which is pretty important.
If you have 3 and one breaks down you have 2 in maintenance, the other on patrol and the maintenance may not be able to be completed in time to replace it. It also would mean that any successful sabotage attempt on the maintenance base would leave us with only 1 sub left that would have to come in eventually.

This doesn't bother me, if only because everyone seems to parrot this off.

Until I know what that tech will be, I have to reserve judgement. Plus, the good news is that if they are tryiing to make savings this will probably be cut.  
  
  
&gt; repealing the 1998 Human Rights Act  
  
I tend to agree that we should keep the act. I don't like the way some of the provisions have been twisted though. Mostly relating to prisoner's votes and privacy.

Don't trust any politician with them. Labour eroded our rights even whilst implementing the Act. This kinda anti-tory crap, when evidence suggests that pretty much every politician everywhere likes to shit on your rights is a little misplaced.

They build everything to a lifetime of 20 years, and nothing that breaks or falls into disrepair near the end of the lease is worth fixing because it will cost them money.

Handling personal finance is tricky, but it basically boils down to two things: money in &amp; money out. combined they equal savings (or debt).  

The strategy you mentioned is often a good way to start, but you need to have a degree of control over the spending and regular knowledge of your account balance for it to work. if the bills you're paying are non-negotiable, it can't help that much.

i suggest looking (hard) at both elements in the equation.  Look at your big expenses and be really honest about if they are necessary (you'd be amazed how much some people spend on cigarettes/booze/coffee, for example).  If they are necessary, think about how they could be reduced - is there a cheaper electricity provider, can you speak to any lenders to see if they'll reduce payments even slightly? could a friend give you a ride to work instead of getting the bus? consider everything, however big or small, and see if there's any way to squeeze it.

then you need to do the same with income. do you have a job where you might be overdue a pay rise or promotion? is there another employer nearby who might be willing to pay more? are there any subsidies/child welfare that you aren't currently claiming that you might be eligible for?

The technology exists. The data is being kept, whether it is by the government or not. How is this different in principle to phone-tapping/steaming open envelopes?

&gt;Obviously these are extreme examples and I'm being a tad sensationalist,

yup. I agree that the manifesto is vague, but elsewhere the definition that has been given is of people who are ""anti-democratic"" (see next link).  I think that is fair and there are plenty of tin-foil hatters in the Tory party to rebel over something dangerous.

Having one animal and just assuming its time of death is standard for all is incredibly bad practice. Animals are living things and they can never be perfect.

I understand you can look at our record and call Europa a distraction, it certainly doesn't help. I can't disagree with that. But it's impossible for a club with a history of spending little to lure players good enough to get you into the Champions League without at least having the allure of European football, which is indicative that you're a semi decent side. 

On the other side, it gives vital other games to allow players to progress. The issue is, we don't manage our squad particularly well. I'm not saying we should prioritise winning  the Europa (that really does little in the long-term), but rather it allows squad players who otherwise may not be able to progress, vital playing time - a fact which surely has some influence when a player is deciding whether or not to join. Similarly, if it weren't for the Europa, we probably wouldn't have seen as much of Kane and he probably would've ended up behind Ade and Soldado. Imagine how bad our season would be, were that the case. The Europa provides an incentive for youth and fringe players with a vital window to showcase their talents and get a place in the team. Without it, we'd only have the League Cup, as the FA cup is still seen as too important to play a second team.

We have a lower chamber which has primacy and could be perfectly capable of representing the wishes of the people, the upper chamber is better employed as a panel of experts making sure that the legislation the lower chamber produces is up to scratch and will do what it is supposed to do.

Let me spell it out. Your argument is that inheritance tax has a disproportionate financial impact on the ""middle class"". I want to test whether that is true or not, because I don't think it is. To do that I need you need to define what middle class is in financial terms. You have rejected the concept of it being ""middle income"" but refuse to put your own economic definition on it, instead resorting to talking about cultural boundaries which conveniently means I can't prove your premise wrong because you have made it totally untestable. To reduce it down further - you have made a claim which should be expressed in numbers but refuse to provide any.

Now. You either accept my proposition that the middle class can be define as being in the middle and having close to average income, in which case your argument is bollocks because inheritance tax and taxation in general does not squeeze those people particularly hard at all and there are no real proposals to do so, or you don't and you are accepting that ""middle class"" explicitly refers to people far more well off than the average and therefore inheritance tax is totally irrelevant to, and will not affect, a majority of people.

null,false,Kitchner,null,null,null,"Depends what you understand democracy to mean.

The original meaning and etymology of the word is basically ""governance by the people"". Traditionally in Greece this meant direct democracy, the demos (the people) voted on proposals. Of course this was also called the tyranny of the majority, if 51% of the population vote to oppress the other 49% that passes.

We live in a representative democracy though, which means we elect others to make decisions on our behalf, the government is no longer ""of the people"" which was the original meaning of the word democracy, but hopefully it is still ""for the people"" because representatives act in the interest of those that elected them. The tyranny of the majority is less of an issue here as (hypothetically) the government is made of people who will sometimes vote against the wishes of the majority to protect the minority. 

So what do we really mean by a democratic system? Because PR is still representative, not true democracy. You could argue that PR is a more *representative* representative democracy that FPTP, but why is that a good thing? What is it supposed to achieve by being more representative?

Well it's supposed to achieve the government better representing ""the people"" by having parties have a number of MPs more reflecting their popular vote. Does it do that though?

Consider the scenario: You have 10 MPs, 4 are always from A, 4 are always from B, 1 is always from C, and 1 switches between A and B. Let's also assume when they vote they need 50%+1 (i.e. 6 votes) to pass laws.

Your election results will look like this:

**Election 1** 

* A: 5 MPs
* B: 4 MPs
* C: 1 MP

**Election 2** 

* A: 4 MPs
* B: 5 MPs
* C: 1 MP

**Election 3** 

* A: 5 MPs
* B: 4 MPs
* C: 1 MP

**Election 4** 

* A: 4 MPs
* B: 5 MPs
* C: 1 MP


The governments from these elections would be:

* Election 1: A+C
* Election 2: B+C
* Election 3: A+C
* Election 4: B+C

So if we also assume each of these governments are in place for 5 years, we have a total of 20 years of government. With the amount of time split thusly:

* A: 10 years (50%)
* B: 10 Years (50%)
* C: 20 years (100%)

Is we look at the % of the vote received on average in each election, you have:

* A: 45%
* B: 45%
* C: 10%

So we have two parties who get nearly 50% of the vote and spend about 50% of the time in government. Sounds good. However you've also got a party that only ever gets 10% of the vote but spends 100% of the time in government. How is that democratic? That is giving great power to a minority.

If it was a FPTP system that resulted in governments switching between A and B with C basically sidelined, it would be shit for that 10% that never got to be in government, but they ARE the minority. 

Going back to the very first point about democracy, true democracy is the tyranny of the majority, if you are in the 10%, you don't get your way. That's just how it is. If 90% vote against something, you don't get to have it. In a PR system though, that 10% uses their disproportionate bargaining power to secure legislation and changes they want, despite being in a minority. 

So no, I don't feel that PR is actually a better democratic system at all, because power is handed to a minority who act as kingmakers despite having a much smaller proportion of the popular vote. No system is going to be perfect, and we've had governments in the UK elected with only 30-40% of the popular vote, that's true. The problem is though coalition governments do give way too much power to the minority, which isn't democratic at all.",null,0,null,1429100698,null,0,false,0,cqd1p5d,null,t3_32l24s,null,t1_cqd1p5d,null,t1_cqcgl4o,null,null,null,1432402777,null,0,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,0,null

null,false,Kitchner,null,null,null,"&gt;Why is a party with 20% of the vote always being in power a problem if 20% of the population are always voting for them?

Here's an example I've used elsewhere:

Consider the scenario: You have 10 MPs, 4 are always from A, 4 are always from B, 1 is always from C, and 1 switches between A and B. Let's also assume when they vote they need 50%+1 (i.e. 6 votes) to pass laws.

Your election results will look like this:

**Election 1** 

* A: 5 MPs
* B: 4 MPs
* C: 1 MP

**Election 2** 

* A: 4 MPs
* B: 5 MPs
* C: 1 MP

**Election 3** 

* A: 5 MPs
* B: 4 MPs
* C: 1 MP

**Election 4** 

* A: 4 MPs
* B: 5 MPs
* C: 1 MP


The governments from these elections would be:

* Election 1: A+C
* Election 2: B+C
* Election 3: A+C
* Election 4: B+C

So if we also assume each of these governments are in place for 5 years, we have a total of 20 years of government. With the amount of time split thusly:

* A: 10 years (50%)
* B: 10 Years (50%)
* C: 20 years (100%)

Is we look at the % of the vote received on average in each election, you have:

* A: 45%
* B: 45%
* C: 10%

So we have two parties who get nearly 50% of the vote and spend about 50% of the time in government. Sounds good. However you've also got a party that only ever gets 10% of the vote but spends 100% of the time in government.

So what is the problem with a party with 20% of the vote always being in power? Well because over the long term they spend a disportionate amount of time in government compared to their level of support. In my example at least 40% of the MPs were always from A, yet they spent only 50% of the time in government.

&gt;Any power they wield within government would be commensurate with their share of the vote: if they get 5% of the vote they're going to have less impact than if they get 25%.

This argument is a total dud sorry.

Say the Parliament had 1,000,000 MPs and you needed 500,001 for the vote to pass, but you've only got 500,000 MPs. You need 1 vote to make that law pass as much as you'd need 25 votes if you were 25 votes short. The amount of MPs I have is totally irrelevant, what matters is that I'm able to make or break your proposals. 

As laws are binary, they either pass or they don't, the number of MPs the third party has is irrelevant beyond ""Can they give us a majority"" because regardless of whether they give you a majority of 1 or 1000, the outcome is the same.

&gt;Handing ""huge amounts of power to a party that is third in popular support"" is less of a problem than our current situation, where we hand all of the power to a party which only one-third of the population support.

No, because over the long term you'll find the Tories and Labour share power roughly proportional to their popular share of the vote over time. The only people that get left out are the minority parties, but in a democratic system they should be left out. While you can say that electing Labour on a 33% share of the vote is bad because 67% of people voted for ""not Labour"" (which isn't true btw, people don't vote against something they vote for something) about 80% of the population voted for ""not Lib Dems"" and even more voted for ""not everyone else"".

No the system isn't perfect, but unless we move to direct democracy nothing will be, and if we DID move to a direct democracy, you would get the same results as FPTP. 50%+1 people voted for the law? Great it's passed, sorry you 49%, this is democracy in action.

The Lib Dems, in a democratic system, shouldn't get any say on anything because they are the minority. So if your argument is purely based around what is more ""democratic"" then you should be advocating for rule of the majority, and the majority says (usually) that they want one of the two main parties in charge, and over the long term, that's what they got.",null,0,null,1429101396,null,0,false,0,cqd1ybi,null,t3_32l24s,null,t1_cqd1ybi,null,t1_cqcg3y4,null,null,null,1432402897,null,0,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,0,null

It is a very different thing if you have non-adherent students and parents to a) shop them to the authorities b) call out the circlejerk in school.


And then if it is so bad they can't make up the numbers of non-adherents they would have to close which is what you want to achieve anyway, just a lot more targeted than ending all faith schools. It just gets those who are intolerant.

Well, atheists are the majority in the UK. We are only a culturally Christian country. People who still believe in a literal sky-wizard are mocked, most would say rightly so, and this assessment of character impedes job prospects. This is oppression of a sort. There are different degrees.

The problem with these cases is that they seem to have a 'correct' answer and people get up in arms.

And the US is not a good example for *anything*. Their level of income inequality is disgusting.

Firstly, the vast majority of business owners do not make £150K.

&gt; RIPA has some serious issues, but you don't need to replace the whole thing in order to fix them.

Much of controversy stems from the criteria for authorising surveillance measures. This should go through a court rather than, or at least in conjunction with, the Home Secretary. 

To say there is no judicial oversight whatsoever is an inaccurate misrepresentation. The Act established an independent tribunal precisely for hearing complaints, not to mention the fact that prosecutions still have to go through a court before they can be successful on evidence gathered under RIPA. Again, this system is not perfect and should constantly be under professional review (as it is). 

What the Greens are proposing *is* so obvious that it is meaningless because they have no detailed plans. All they have are vague and obvious notions about how things in this regard should be. This contributes little of substance to the debate.

I would say you don't actually know much about this area of law and have probably never read any of the relevant cases or academic sources. You're probably not even aware that RIPA isn't the only law or set of regulations relevant to this discussion, another reason simply scrapping RIPA is a thoroughly hollow proposal. Ironically, the attitude of saying it has problems therefore we must scrap it is shared with the Conservative's approach to the HRA.

Well, I think some of the schools criticised did have non-muslim students.  I'm pretty sure, the non-muslims don't sit through the relevant Islamic classes.  They likely do something else, so wouldn't necessarily be exposed to radical views like the others.

I don't see how anything you've said supports your view that religious schools lead to theists not having a narrative of oppression.  We could give Islamic communities sharia law, free Islamic schools and free money and they'd still likely feel oppressed.

null,false,mojojo42,null,null,null,"&gt; This argument is a total dud sorry.

I think it's exactly where your argument breaks down - you're totalling up time in government without accounting for influence in government.

&gt; Say the Parliament had 1,000,000 MPs and you needed 500,001 for the vote to pass, but you've only got 500,000 MPs. You need 1 vote to make that law pass as much as you'd need 25 votes if you were 25 votes short. The amount of MPs I have is totally irrelevant, what matters is that I'm able to make or break your proposals.

Except that scenario only happens for a three line whip, where MPs must vote along party lines or they risk losing their job, and it ignores the fact that passing legislation is a [lengthy process](http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/passage-bill/) and not just a single vote.

It's true that the final bill is either passed or not, however it's rarely the case that all MPs vote exactly on party lines. The more MPs you have the more likely you are to be able to pass a bill and the more influence you will have on that bill as it passes through the various stages of parliament (with the converse also being true: a single-MP party has very little influence, even if in extremely rare situations their vote could make the difference).

&gt; While you can say that electing Labour on a 33% share of the vote is bad because 67% of people voted for ""not Labour"" (which isn't true btw, people don't vote against something they vote for something) about 80% of the population voted for ""not Lib Dems"" and even more voted for ""not everyone else"".

That's true, but the point I was responding to was that it was somehow bad to give power to parties that didn't come first. Under FPTP you end up with parties claiming to ""have a mandate"" when the reality is they have nothing of the sort.

&gt; So if your argument is purely based around what is more ""democratic"" then you should be advocating for rule of the majority, and the majority says (usually) that they want one of the two main parties in charge, and over the long term, that's what they got.

I don't think that follows. A completely democratic system isn't some kind of gold standard to aim for since, as you point it, it allows for the tyranny of the majority. However you can still have systems that are more democratic (or perhaps ""more representative"") than others, and if you accept the principle that politics should reflect the population's desires then we should be very wary of systems that explicitly don't do that.

For example, by far the most common argument for FPTP is that ""it creates strong government"". That's simply a euphemism for ""avoiding the situation where parties have to work together"".",null,0,null,1429102630,null,0,false,0,cqd2gew,null,t3_32l24s,null,t1_cqd2gew,null,t1_cqd1ybi,null,null,null,1432403134,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

5. At 47, he can become our manager for years to come, he is the type of manager that in my opinion is willing to adapt to modern game, not even mentioning that he is a very loyal person.

6. He is a person that is capable to attract quality transfers, both established players and younger one will see him as a manager who can help them to make progress. I can see players agreeing to transfer just because of him. (Especially those who worked with him, Reus as an example.)

To sum up, this is the manager I would trust when rebuilding our squad in next 2-3 years. One of the best tacticians, great person, I would give him the time needed to rebuilt, and I see him as an improvement over Manuel. Those are just my thoughts, I understand that some people would prefer that Pellegrini stays. 

I just think that with a lot of transfers coming, there will be no better time for another manager to come, especially Klopp, because he will need specific type's of players with his football system that we don't currently have. I don't want the club to spend millions this summer for players that Pellegrini needs, then sack him, invite another manager, sell players for lower price, buy another ones, and lose money + team cohesion.

What I wrote is about as specific as you get: in Scotland you *could* be found guilty of reckless endangerment, in the UK you *could* be found guilty of negligence.  ""*Could* being the operative word.  If you want more detail than that then you can read the relevant laws yourself:

e.g. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/8-9/28/section/1/enacted
 
There isn't a law that says ""You can be found guilty of negligence if you have a swimming pool and an intruder drowns in it"".  That's now how laws are written.  It would be up to a judge and/or jury to determine the extent to which you responsible for the *general* crime of negligence or reckless endangerment.

If you have a fence then you've probably got nothing to worry about.

If you didn't have a fence (however unlikely you think that might be) then it would, by your own admission, be an open invite for people to come and use it.  In that case, you could be held liable for any injury because you effectively ""invited"" them to come and use your pool.  Not explicitly, but implicitly by not erecting a fence to keep them out.

null,false,uhyeahreally,null,null,null,"&gt;Well, I think some of the schools criticised did have non-muslim students. I'm pretty sure, the non-muslims don't sit through the relevant Islamic classes. They likely do something else, so wouldn't necessarily be exposed to radical views like the others.

No way they had 25%. The point is to have a different culture. If a quarter of the students don't believe it, the school can't pretend it is the only worldview and that anyone who doesn't hold it is evil. That is a lot more important than whether the non-adherents attend the religious classes or not.


&gt; religious schools lead to theists not having a narrative of oppression.

not my view at all. My point is not to give them things which they can persuade *rational* people are evidence of intolerance. The narrative is going to exist, the point is to keep it absurd.

&gt;It is important to do. It would lead to a more cohesive society and hence help stem the radicalisation which the linked article raises as a serious issue. I think that might count as being necessary to some degree.

There are a lot of excellent faith schools. Faith schools tend to get better results (obviously that doesn't apply to Islamic schools). Shutting them all down unilaterally is an overreaction. There are already processes to shut down the bad ones.

&gt;Source? That's simply not true.

only 30% of the population describe themselves as religious. Cultural affiliation is not the same as belief. Similarly Israel is majority atheist, because most of the Jews are secular.

&gt;People who still believe in a literal sky-wizard are mocked, most would say rightly so, and this assessment of character impedes job prospects. This is oppression of a sort.
&gt;This is nonsense. I've never heard of such paranoid garbage. Let me guess, you think Christianity is under attack because the evil atheists want to remove prayers for Jesus from schools?

I simply don't understand how you could get that from what I said, it seems a bit unrelated to my point.
To respond directly, though, I would say that there is no harm done by having a few prayers in school. I wouldn't call atheists who want to stop that ""evil"". I just wouldn't agree with them that it is the best idea. 

Look, by all means argue for the abolition of faith schools, but doing so the basis of these problem Islamic schools is disingenuous as there are many less extreme ways to solve that problem.
