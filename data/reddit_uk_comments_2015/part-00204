You could of debated the points I make about the system letting them down, full employment not existing, post industrial economy not providing the jobs needed, a right wing ideology that *needs* a permanent reserve army of labour, or an unemployed class and welfare being the price to pay for stopping these people from starving. 
Welfare bills like this chaps getting out of hand due to the neo liberals selling off state assets like social housing and relying on grossly inflated private rentals to provide social housing in a speculative driven housing bubble subsidized by the government and spiralling out of control. 
That the abuses of the welfare state by a small minority of people are **nothing** in comparison to the tax fraud and evasion by the same people outraged at this family for having kids, living in a **four** bed home! the cheek of it!

But you didnt, you just had a petulant rant about not caring and I assume wanting to pay taxes, *if they go to poor people with kids*

Charming. 

This man was in work for 13 years, he was made redundant. Their kids wear hand me downs, the parents neither drink nor smoke. 

They are hardly institutionalized scammers. 

So what, should people like this have no children in case they get made redundant?  by people like this I mean Poor people, how do you stop poor people having children?  getting a bit tricky now isn't it?

But you already gave the game away when you said "" **They caused their own problem 100%,I want nothing to do with the, poor or anyone**""

It is quite apparent that *you* don't get it.

It's faster and he really knows me and knows what to do and not to do with me. Don't mind spending money on my (mental) health. Went to a doctor in the UK once but I had to wait ages to be seen. By then I was already really upset. He didn't seem to give a crap about my panic attacks (huge needle and blood phobia) and was more interested in arguing with me about how I didn't need certain tests because I couldn't possibly be low. (B12 included, even though I said I'm a vegetarian) They're probably not all like that but I ran before he could even think about grabbing the needle and never returned. It's really hard for me to have a blood test, even without all that crap. My doctor in Belgium takes 45 minutes if that's what it takes for me to be okay, England was more of a ""number 82924 please! Hurry up, we've got 5 minutes!"" kind of thing.

I'd just go and get it done privately if you can't get it on the NHS or if your doctor isn't informed about the vegetarian diet and is being a prick. Make sure to mention they should check B12 as it isn't routinely tested. If you're normal but on the low end, take supplements anyway. You can't overdose on B12, better to prevent it from going down. Sometimes they will do a finger prick test to test for iron, but the finger prick test is not a good one for vegetarians unfortunately, so make sure not to get that one. It doesn't actually measure iron, they just often say it does because most people have acceptable levels of B12 so when it's low they automatically tend to assume it's iron. If it comes back normal your B12 could still be too low and your iron high or the other way around. Best to make a list for yourself of all things you feel could be low and make sure they are included.

As most replies have stated, it's rather dependant on the company but officially you should be buying a ticket before travel if the facilities are there. 
Some TMs will charge a full open single price if you try to buy on-board if there  are facilities but you chose not to use them. Depends on the TM really - how benevolent and commission hungry they are. 
After checking tickets for a period of time, it's remarkably easy to get all the info needed with a quick glance. 
Body language can be a huge tell if someone has the wrong ticket or lacking a railcard. 
Personally if someone has a valid reason and/or a pleasant tone I'll do what I can to get them onboard. 
As someone mentioned, if you have a railcard on Virgin, you do not need to worry about peak and off peak. 
Personally I'd also look into advance purchase tickets. You can buy them weeks before travel and save a huge amount of cash. What you save in funds however, you lose in flexibility; they are only valid on the booked train.

null,false,Tophattingson,null,null,null,"&gt;I know ISAs are an option but I'm still not 100% sure how they work.

An ISA is an investment arrangement whereby you can put in limited (currently £15,240) amount of money each year from after tax income and be exempt from income or capital gains tax on any returns. Since it's extremely unlikely you will exceed that limit, if you intend to do any investing an ISA is a good option.

There are two main categories of ISA, which have further subdivisions within them based precisely on what you chose to do with them.

**Cash ISA**

A cash ISA gives a guaranteed percentage return on the money you put in. This is almost risk free, there is no way to lose money unless the bank collapsed and you have &gt;£85,000 invested (smaller sums are protected by FSCS).

The two types of Cash ISA are easy access and fixed. With easy accessed, it functions in a way you would be familiar with. You can take your money out without penalty. You can still take your money out from a fixed cash ISA, but you will get an interest penalty.

Cash ISAs are usually managed directly by banks.

When to get a Cash ISA: When you want a tax free savings account with 0 risk of ending up with less money than what you put in, even though you will get comparatively low returns. Easy Access gives ~1.5% a year at the moment, while Fixed gives ~2.5%. You might struggle to beat inflation. Note that Savings Accounts can offer a better deal than a Cash ISA.

**Stocks and Shares ISA**

An S&amp;S ISA is similarly tax free. However, you can do a lot more with it. Here are some but not all of the investments you can put in it:

* Cash
* Unit Trusts
* Investment Trusts
* Stock Market shares
* Government Bonds / Gilts

Unlike a Cash ISA, it's possible to lose money with a Stocks and Shares ISA. There is no stated rate of return; it depends on the market.

The stereotypical view of buy low sell high for individual shares is probably not what you should be doing with this kind of ISA. The stereotypical view that only stock market addicts who's eyes are glued to a ticker tape should bother with this sort of thing are also wrong.

A typical sensible use of an S&amp;S ISA are to create a diversified portfolio of funds (or a single fund of funds) with some mix of bonds and equities (stocks/shares) that you keep in the long-term. The greater the number of equities, the higher the risk. 20% Bond 80% Equity would be described as high risk, 80% Bond 20% Equity would be low risk.

In general, the longer-term you intend to keep the money saved the more risk you can take because sudden losses can be recovered over many years of steady growth.

When to get an S&amp;S ISA: When you want a tax efficient investment that has risk and a potential for you to lose money, but greater average annual returns. Ballpark long term average annual returns are ~4% for low risk and ~8% for high risk.

When Rafa was our manager, Reina won the golden glove several years on the trot, and our solid defense and conservative system was a big factor. People HATED watching us play, much like Chelsea these days. But when you have players in their peak like Gerrard, Alonso and Torres it's hard not to enjoy the football. He built the team around a strong defence and midfield, and then attempted to add the pieces around it.

Take Kuyt for example, he came to Liverpool as a striker, and left as a RM. Rafa turned him into a wide man who would track back but also provide goals. Then look at someone like Riera or Babel, two players not as willing to embrace the defensive side of the game. Sterling could fall into this mould.

I get the feeling that Rafa will stick to his ways and make Madrid a resolute and stout unit, somewhat like Juve. However, there's just so much attacking quality in the side that it would be tough to totally switch emphasis. I still think he'll use some sort of 433, with a slightly more defensive mid 3 than what Madrid grew accustomed this year. Where would this leave Sterling?

null,false,RushsMustache,lfc68,,null,"So his average league position over a three year period (5th) sits in line with the clubs financial strength within the league. To me that suggests he has not necessarily over achieved in improving our league standing in this time but has simply performed to 'par'. 

I didn't necessarily say that any manager could have got us to where we were last season, more that any reasonably capable manager, such as the targets FSG approached before Rodgers, could have done so. He certainly deserves credit for the way Liverpool played last season, but there's no way we can say for certain that anyone else couldn't have done similar. We should also note that without the anomaly of last year our average league position would not sit in accordance to our league financial position. 

So again, I contest that any reasonably capable manager could have improved our league standing in line with our league financial strength and it is not necessarily attributable to Rodgers' aptitude as a manager. 

You also argue that the transfer committee's failure to land a high quality striker essentially doomed the season. That seems quite revisionist to me as a lot of fans were more than happy with our transfer dealings at the beginning of the season but they just haven't panned out as expected. I feel that odd team selections and tactical inflexibility have contributed substantially to these players' inability to perform to levels expected. It's the manager who selects the team and I feel too often we see the ineptitude of the committee used to shield Rodgers from fair criticism. However, I would agree that the committee doesn't work, in its current form at least, and requires serious reconsideration. 

It could also be argued that by focusing on equating financial spending to league standing, and the lack of a striker dooming our season, is to greatly ignore the wider context of the season and the numerous opportunities that have been squandered. Consider the run in to fourth, what did Utd get out of their games after they beat us? 11 out of 24 points or so? What did Liverpool achieve? 8 out of 24? They just gave up when things were still faintly achievable and some of that may have been started by Rodgers coming out and saying that top 4 was 'almost impossible' after the Arsenal loss. If the manager is already throwing in the towel then the players can't really be blamed too harshly for doing the same.

I've never ridden on the road before I got my CBT so i was naturally terrified but I read up on the Highway code cover to cover a couple of times and made sure that I understood it.

Though when it came to doing the practical stuff I struggled a lot to do the slow speed on the off road so i was asked to come back a couple of days later to practice on a scooter. Baring in mind I'm a 22 year old bloke that's built like a tank, this was kind of embarrassing xD but I am not the most coordinated so I don't mind.

Anyway, eventually I got slow speed down and they let me out on the road to do the on road and as I was coming down to a roundabout, either my brain switched off or I was just not thinking right i set off into an ""occupied"" roundabout into the path of a car. 
Under normal circumstances i should have known not to, just that one time i completely didn't think. I gave the 2 people i was with quite a scare... never mind myself xD and most of that was because the instructor was instructing the other girl i was with and i got confused because I couldn't hear. She was ahead of me and the instructor was behind me so I thought he meant me. 

Later on in the day i was coming up to a 3 into 2 junction where you have 2 forward and 1 coming lanes that go into a normal 2 lane road with a left and a right turn and the headset died just as he was about to say which way we were going so I lost my temper and turned off, stopping on a side road. 

It was then that i also realized i was struggling with the indicators. I couldn't activate them or cancel them with my left hand as they were on a stalk that was six million miles away from the grip and they didn't switch off properly. 

I asked to go back another day to get more on road in me when I wasn't so nervy and had a think and he still wrote me the CBT and said that I'm safe-ish on the road, especially with how i handled the headset going. ""5-6 hours or constant riding is tough so after a break and some thought you'd do much better, just keep an eye on things and relax"".

So something to keep in mind is that everyone has different boundaries and what's acceptable for some would be a no no for others and not to take things too personally either. 

You may make mistakes in the present, like i made heaps but there's usually a reason for them, take a step back, think, learn, watch and then when you do, you wont make the same mistake again because you'll know not to :)
Oh and most instructors are also highly strung as well, a lot of them have been in an accident or 2 and know fully well of the risks of the road and want to make sure that people are safe on the road. again, if they are loud that's not necessarily their fault, they can also be as scared as you are about you doing well.

P.S: I've been a CBT rider for just under a year now, and every day I'm getting better with the bike, learning new things about my bike and the road and soon I'll be doing my mod 1 and 2 :)

TL;DR: I made more than enough mistakes on my CBT and still got the certificate, don't take things too personally :)

We have a moron writing letters without checking the names of the political parties before writing, the fact that check actually needs to be made is a cause for concern. Then we have an exceptional example of modern journalism calling out the moron on twitter by expressing surprise that the main office of Labour, the UK one, is handling a UK wide matter (general elections being a fairly all encompassing issue), it is unclear if he thinks the referendum for independence was a yes vote or if he thinks Scottish Labour are a partner of and not subsidiary to Labour, surely a 'Political Reporter' as his twitter info lists him should be more up to speed on how the parties are managed.

Then I looked at the comments section where I saw this comment from a nutter:
&gt; ""Its up to each to vote with conscience and if the party you usually follow or are a member of is not going the way it was then you are entitled to vote for another party,their claim on your mind is wrong.""

According to this fine specimen of rational thought, kicking somebody out of a political party is somehow suppressing their right to vote freely? It makes me wonder if he is aware party membership is a thing, if he is, does he think it is a right to be part of a party no matter what? Where would he get that idea. He added 2 and 2, somehow came out with √-1.

Labour have completely arsed this up, they were fully correct to remove rebels from the party, they didn't have to be dicks about it. The tone of the letter makes it sound more like the kind of letter that would reprimand an MP going against the whip, not remotely designed for engaging with the public; certainly not a member of the public who might have changed their mind in 5 years and voted Labour again, bollocks all chance of that now then is there.

If you like character arcs then season 8 was excellent. If however, you enjoyed things like the second half of season 6 which seemed focused on smashing the characterization of the main crew then it might not be for you.

Look at how we treat alcohol. It's a legal drug which is safe in moderation and damaging in excess or with long-term use. It's been legal for ages, and we are all familiar with its effects and suitably educated about the dangers of consuming too much.

Yet people go out, deliberately trying to get mortal drunk. Something like 40% of all crime is carried out under the influence of alcohol. Half of rapes and incidents of domestic violence. Countless vehicle accidents. Fighting in the streets when drunk. Huge amount of police time used up to look after those people who stumble out of bars and clubs at night. City centres generally turn into unpleasant, intimidating places on Fri/Sat nights. 

And finally, there's the enormous amount of medical staff time and resources used to take care of people who turn up to hospital drunk. Around half of A&amp;E visits on a Friday or Saturday are alcohol related - either from drinking too much, or the fighting that often results.

That's a legal drug which has been around for ages, and we are hardly model citizens when it comes to using it responsibly.

They do not burden the health care system because they generally do not have one unless they pay out of their own pockets.  There is a reason why the President granted many of them amnesty.

For the UK to tolerate the current and soon to be flood of illegal migrants would mean the country needs these people for low paying jobs.  What I see as the problem with the tolerance,  is that these people will receive taxpayer paid health care and homes.  Can you afford to do this?

With many things in the EU a country is able to put forward an argument that the way they do things is better and present an argument why everyone should move to their standards. After a bit of political ego stroking from every country with a stake in the decision that allows them to go back home and say why it was their idea it can move forward.

With something like this we hit a snag. Every country is going to see the cost of implementing a new system but no country can make an argument as to why the others should have to do it and move to their standard because even if one is marginally better there will be grumbling about cost.

So to go back to the XKCD I linked, the fair way forward would be to make a new standard, a more modern one and everybody has to change...Good luck to whoever ended up with that job, they got the small countries to change and Germany leading the way but. France and the UK still need to do it and we haven't been in a rush these last 16 years.

Not saying it can't be done of course, I just don't think the countries of the EU will be motivated enough to spend anything on it, especially with our governments promise of an in/out referendum making any investment riskier because if we withdraw from EU trade agreements who knows if Eurostar would be profitable with the new arrangements.",null,0,null,1433051370,null,0,1433051674,0,crqltmc,null,t3_37vtle,null,t1_crqltmc,null,t1_crqcgrd,null,null,null,1433493652,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The system does need to be flexible enough to prevent nonsense like this eviction; when all's said and done I'd doubt it saved the public purse much for the distress it caused.

Meals at school, subsidised uniforms, etc. would be a way to target resources to the kids. I think the universal credit, combined with the benefits cap, is the Tories way of painting a target on the heads of the poor so they can label them as sponges.

It seems like their kids have real potential as well, and the real tragedy would be to see that go unrealised.

I have some small idea of how social mobility works; in three generations my family has gone from squatting in an abandoned bunker to ownership of a professional small business. My Dad, at age 40, was one of the first in his family to go to university after the pits closed. My parents always worked and were able to buy a house, have four kids and we never lacked any of the essentials. I'm not sure if that is the kind of story of social mobility that warms a Tory's heart or gives them sleepless nights.

The only benefits we had was child allowance. My education wasn't free, but £1,000 tuition fees weren't insurmountable. Student loans at nominal rates meant debt, but manageable debt; I was able to clear this in my first decade of working life. Banks gave 100% mortgages, remember that? I was able to get on the housing ladder while still at university.

I'm not convinced the same would be possible now. This family will never be able to afford to buy a house unless the bubble bursts. It's going to see a minimum of £210,000 in debt to send those 7 kids to university.  Student loans are now looking more like commercial loan rates.

The same opportunities I had a mere 20 years ago no longer exist for this family. Sure it's possible some of their kids will be doctors or lawyers, but they will be vastly more in debt when they graduate, and the prospect of home ownership will likely be years if not decades out of sight.

Mine is £20 (I just checked). If you're in receipt of income support, child tax credit, etc. then you're entitled to receive the average bill for your area (which you've just said is £30). Fine, I accept that £20 difference.

&gt;Hahahhahahahaha. Where the fuck do you get that figure from?

The energy statement from my shared flat. Ofgem say the average bill for a 4-bed house is £95 a month (that's not including lower rate from non-Big Six suppliers), so tack that £65 onto my £20 error earlier.

&gt;Line rental is £17 now. How do you get phone calls and internet for £3 per month?

TalkTalk do line rental + broadband for £21.70/month (the broadband part is also free for 12 months of the 24 month contract), and you get a £100 Love2Shop voucher. Home broadband couldn't be any more highly competitive.

* **Utopia** - Conspiracy story about a group of forum dwellers that have nothing else in common, that obsess over an obscure graphic novel. They find out the graphic novel is more than just a story and are forced into hiding by a murderous organisation.

* **Happy Valley** - A small town police force deals with a big crime, headed by the only competent officer. Meanwhile, someone she put away a long time ago is headed back into town. I would not refer to this as ""female drama"" that you wanted to avoid. The main character happens to be a woman, and a seriously capable hero of this show (think Broadchurch's Miller).

* **Line of Duty** - The only honest cop in a botched anti-terrorism operation is seconded to internal affairs. His first target is the Police Officer of the Year.

* **What Remains** - A retiring detective refuses to stop investigating a mystery he encounters on his last day at work: the decayed remains of a young woman found in the attic of her own apartment building, never reported missing. The detective discovers what lies under the surface of the building's other tenants.

* **Misfits** - Chavs with super powers. Very watchable for most of its five series run. The powers are far from Earth shattering but just enough to make the cast's life miserable. They constantly encounter people who were also granted powers, some of them with devious plans on how to use them

* **Being Human** - A ghost, a vampire and a werewolf live together. Surprisingly not a comedy, and created by Doctor Who alum Toby Whithouse.

* **Outcasts** - Mankind's first offworld colony undergoes a power struggle. Cancelled after first season so might be a bit of a tease. The first episode is a little misleading regarding the tone of the show, but it was worth persisting.

* **Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell** - One man is determined to return magic to England in the 19th century. On his quest to become the sole magician in England, he encounters a second more charming magician who has very different opinions on the control of magic. Based on the excellent novel by Sussana Clarke. Currently airing on BBC.

* **The Fades** - A young man finds he has the ability to see ""ghosts"" (or Fades). The Fades are no longer ""moving on"" from the living world, and have a plan to reclaim their lives that must be stopped.

* **Edge of Darkness** - Somewhat older than the rest of the list, a noir thriller about a cop whose daughter is shot and dies in his arms. While investigating who attempted to kill him, he discovers he may not have been the intended target. Remade into a movie with Mel Gibson some years ago, the original is superior. Possibly Joe Don Baker's best role as an slightly mad American interloper who may be the only person the cop can trust.

* **I, Claudius** - Much older than the rest of this list, this is essential viewing if you enjoy UK drama. It's like *Game of Thrones* but based on true events in the Roman Empire (so no dragons or white walkers). It features a stellar cast and some rather shocking developments from history. Interestingly, HBO and BBC2 were working on remake this with Jane Tranter at the helm.

Actually that's not quite true, Anglia Railways was profitable (well the Intercity route anyway) but the DfT at the time had the idea of consolidating some of the smaller companies into bigger companies, so everything going out of Liverpool St would be run by one TOC (With the exception of c2c).

This mega franchise (compromising Anglia Railways, Great Eastern and half of WAGN) was then let to National Express operating under the brand ONE.

The DfT decided to not bother with the consolidation scheme after this trial, and as of today actually the franchise is broken up again with bits going to Overground and bits going to TfL Rail (future crossrail).",null,0,null,1433059711,null,0,false,0,crqo4zu,null,t3_37ulhg,null,t1_crqo4zu,null,t1_crq7l61,null,null,null,1433494743,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

While the university will have to provide the necessary funding, I can see it becoming much harder for students to get the support they need.

You can get them from AAA stores in the US (they drag their heals and take 45 minutes if you're not a AAA member, but all it really is them putting a passport picture on a piece of card and stamping it).

Once you have that you can use the two combined for 1 year. After that it isn't valid. You can't acquire a UK license until after you have been in the UK for more than erm I think it said 185 days on the test, but essentially 6 months. You can get a UK provisional license by filling out the form, but there are restrictions on its use. For example car driver's can't drive without a full UK license holder that is older than 21 and has held their license for more than 3 years. They can't drive after dark or on motorways. Motorbikes are different because they only have the driver, but I would assume the restrictions on when/where you can drive are the same. However I believe that the provisional licenses are valid for 2 years, so as long as you only need to drive during the day then you have a long period in which to pass your test.

To get a full UK driver's license you have to pass the theory test and the practical test. 

The theory test comprises of 50 questions out of a possible nearly 1000 questions, and the hazard awareness test. For that my only tip will be that you click the mouse button when you first see the hazard. There is no mouse pointer so, unlike some of the demos that you'll fine, you don't have to click _on_ the hazard.

For the practical test, be aware that there can be _very_ long waits for the practical test. At least for cars, might not be as long for bikes I suppose. I originally had to schedule my test for about 2 months after my theory test. You can't book the practical until 1 working day after you have passed your theory test, so if time is important book it right away. However keep going back and looking for cancellations.

But seriously, people don't realise that papers love to vilify the poor. Remember the mum with the 9 bedroom house (or something) being punished by the bedroom tax? They love to show the extremes, but these people are in the minority. It's the people who are actually realistically impacted by new policies that they don't show.

Regardless, yes the parents fucked up but that is no reason to dump the children onto the street. We should have the resources to cope with situations like these. I guarantee all this policy does is save the gov a few coppers in the grand scheme and ruin thousands of lives. Oh and probably win a few more conservative votes.

Rodgers: 8th (Before Rodgers) to 7th to 2nd to 6th. 

I wouldn't say he had nothing to show for in his first two seasons, that's a pretty big jump as I would't say Rodgers had nothing to show for up to this past season as 8th to 2nd was a big jump. 

Before Klopp took over, Dortmund last won a trophy in 2001. Liverpool won a trophy the year preceding Rodger's reign. 

But here's where I get repetitive b/c I've said this too many times &amp; I'm sick of it. The squad imo has looked extremely unmotivated for a while now, they look like they've stopped fighting for him &amp; that is my biggest criticism. 

I don't think that's the case, I hope most aren't expecting Klopp to wave a magic wand over the situation as soon as he walks in to the door if he happens to take the job. I think long term wise, people (including me) feel more confident with a manager who has a proven track record, a manager who has been in the spotlight of a CL final, a manager who has fought off one of the best teams in Bayen consistently, a manager who demands respect &amp; has a very suitable philosophy to our squad. He plays a high pressing, high tempo game, our squad is built for that. He nurtured young talent when he went into Dortmund (Sahin, Kagawa, Gotze, Reus, Hummels, etc.), our squad is looking for that. 

It's not on a whim, there are several reasons why I think Klopp is a good fit, but the primary reasons are that the players look like they stopped fighting for Rodgers &amp; that we need an experienced manager when our squad itself is so inexperienced. It just feels like Klopp has already done what Rodgers is attempting to do. Sorry for the long post, I'm actually starting to get tired of talking about this tbh.

Discussions are ongoing between the SPFL and SFA, aimed at league reconstruction in time for the start of the 2016-17 campaign.


And, it is understood, serious consideration is being given to revolutionary proposals that would see two leagues of 12 – split into three of eight – after each team had played each other twice.


It is a system which used to operate in Switzerland and Austria, and has long been championed by SFA’s former Chief Executive Gordon Smith, who played in both countries.


At its heart is a mini play-off league – Premiership 2 – in which clubs fight it out to be one of four who claim a place in the following year’s top flight of 12.


The four losers start the next season in the second tier.


Such a set-up this year would have pitted Championship front-runners Rangers, Hearts, Hibs and Queen of the South against Premiership quartet St Mirren, Motherwell, Ross County and Partick Thistle in a League of Death.


As an extension of the plan, Smith would like to see clubs retain the points they collected in the first half of the season against the clubs who would be their opposition in the second half of the campaign.


Had the system been in place this season, Rangers would have started bottom of the eight, having gathered just three points in their first two meetings against their fellow Championship sides.


That would have left them a whopping 15 points behind the Jambos, who would have started the second half of the campaign ahead of the clubs who had dropped down from the top flight.


Advocates argue the 14-game campaign – each team would again play each other home and away – would hold huge appeal for broadcasters and sponsors alike.


Also that the format would be fairer than the play-offs currently raging just now because it would ensure the best teams over a longer period would win out.


A similar proposal was considered by the SPL and SFL two years ago but failed to gain sufficient support. That led to the birth of the SPFL in June, 2013.


Under an agreement struck then, no change can be made to the existing structure until next summer without the unanimous backing of the 42 clubs. That, it is generally accepted, is not going to happen this summer.


The ongoing discussions are therefore with a view to getting a new set up in place in time for the start of the following season, 2016-17.


The 12-12-18 is not the only proposal that will be put on the table.


Among other alternatives are ones which would see the current 12-team top tier either reduced to 10, or expanded to 16.


But with the country desperate to find a radical alternative that can capture the attention of fans and television companies alike, it is seen as having a live chance of success.


The SPFL have already shown their willingness for innovation, with big changes planned for the League Cup in 2016-17.

Not even including awful desicions from the officials in other matches, there are loads of times I can remember villa get screwed by bad officiating this year: Mason not being sent off with Benteke, Gabby being sent off for being fouled by Young, Benteke offside call against city resulting in a possible red card, pen and win turning into a loss, Austins horror tackle against gabby that only got a yellow, no penalties today after two blatant fouls, no foul against given in the Everton match when he was being held down which ended up with us conceding a goal. Those are just some of the ones I can call of the top of my head. I don't understand how people get annoyed by these calls but forget about them so quickly when they happen so often. The guardian review of the game sums it up: ""villa had two late penalty appeals that went unnoticed, but by then it was largely irrelevant"". Just because villa didn't deserve a goal or whether a goal would effect the overall outcome, does not mean they didn't deserve a penalty. Whats the point in writing rules down then if this the view?

 I'm sticking to my guns here, not bothered whether it's an unpopular opinion or seen as me being ungracious in defeat. I dont feel right winning a game on bad calls, same as I hate losing games on a bad call. The refs need replays in the name of fairness, the opinion that the bad calls we get will be matched by the calls that go for us is ridiculous. Why not eradicate bad calls altogether?

The quality when using Ringo's PSTN solution is significantly higher than VoIP options I've used.

If you are in the U.S., you could use Feel at Home to call the UK Ringo number to call the U.S., which is free on Ringo (0c/minute).

Hence Feel at Home + Ringo gives you: free UK and free US+Canada calls, all via PSTN. No reliance on the quality of internet connection.  As well as very cheap calls to tons of other countries.

They don't understand the freedom of speech concept then.  It's not there to protect the right to talk about kittens.  It's there to protect speech which others would consider offensive or wrong-headed.  You can certainly think that hate speech should be illegal, but you shouldn't also pretend that you're in favor of free-speech, because you can't have it both ways.

&gt;You can't shout ""FIRE"" in a packed theatre.

Has nothing to do with this argument.  Unless you think that KT's comments were placing people imminent and real danger.  

(Also - [you should look up the origin of this phrase.](https://www.thefire.org/a-reminder-about-shouting-fire-in-a-crowded-theater/)  \)

&gt;Freedom of speech has limits. Inciting violence or inciting hatred against a protected minority is one of those limits.

Well, those are just the limits you think should be applied.  But I think you're desperately wrong.  Just about any contentious speech could be framed as 'inciting hatred'.  Try to ban hate-speech and you will also be closing the door on freedom of speech.  You will be handing over the power of the censor to whoever gets to decide what is or isn't hateful.  And who would you trust with that position?  Who would you want regulating *your* speech? Some fusty old judge?  A Conservative government minister?  A diversity officer?

And what's a 'protected' minority?  Are we to make criticism of Islam illegal, because it incites hatred against Muslims?  What about criticism of immigration, lest it incite hatred against immigrants.  Or maybe you want to criticize Israel, in which case someone will tell you that you're inciting hatred against Jews.  You probably think that none of these cases would result in prosecutions and that the line is absolutely clear between inciting hatred and legitimate criticism of ideas, but I'm not so sure.  Time and again we see people debate whether a particular argument has crossed the line into bigotry - and I'm not aware of any reliable way of arbitrating these problems.

I imagine the Act would have to remain in effect in Northern Ireland, or the NI government would be swayed to introduce an Irish bill of rights (as they have been advised to do already by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission) that closely follows the HRA. However due to the structure of current legislation (as you mentioned) these types of changes are a minefield. No idea about Wales, I'm afraid. 

The thornier issue, in my opinion, than whether and how the HRA remains as legislation in various parts of the UK, is the effect on the union if the UK government decides that it has to withdraw from the ECHR (which they will almost certainly have to do, in the case of a more restricted English/British bill of rights, when cases simply pass straight to the ECtHR). It can only do this as a state, and the UK government would be effectively removing the ability for citizens in the constituent countries to have their cases heard in the ECtHR, irrespective of whether and how the HRA remains. It would also leave them in the odd position of having the decisions of ECtHR still integrated into their legal systems without being party to the ECHR.

I was in my mid-30s before I tried to apply for a driving licence and they asked for proof of my name change which I didn't have. I looked into it and realised I never legally changed my name, I was just wandering round with an alias for all those years.

It was nothing at all to apply for a backdated Deed Poll certificate and I haven't had an issue since. Nothing has come of the fact that I've been employed since 18 under an alias, my stamps have been paid, tax and I claimed unemployment all under my not officially changed to name.

Obviously it's your choice to feed your kids whatever you like, but please make sure that what you tell them is correct and that your decisions are backed up by facts - the meat and dairy industry is very, very successful at convincing people to buy what they're selling. Cow's milk is the perfect example: literally millions spent on advertising and lobbying, and now everybody thinks it gives you calcium for healthy bones, but it actually leaves your bones worse off. You're much, much better getting calcium elsewhere, and since it's a mineral, it is found in the ground and therefore in plants.

Whether or not you view nutrition etc through the lens of animal cruelty, we all owe it to ourselves to at least be aware of what we're doing. Your own mother may not have had the knowledge she needed to ensure that her children received adequate nutrition, but you do not have to go through that again. There is a lot of information available these days, and time and time again it is shown that the human body does not need meat and dairy to thrive.

Please don't take this as me trying to tell you what to do and what to feed your kids, that's obviously your own business. I think education and access to information is the important thing. Knowing what your body needs and where to get it is possibly one of the most important things that a human *can* know - it just frustrates me that the advertising / lobbying money of the meat and dairy industries seems to be so well spent.

g) You do realise that businesses are based on maximising profits for shareholders. What you want is the fall of capitalism and fairness and equality for all. Read up on East Germany in the 1960s-1990s. That's what you're asking for.

So basically your entire argument, is it's not fair! Life isn't. Get used to it. If you have a problem with it, spend some time in a South African slum for a bit, cooking out precious metals from electronic waste, wading in chemical waste... now that isn't fair.

How can men compete with the maternal bond? As much as we share the load of parenting between sexes, men can never match the level of physical connection so are limited in what they can achieve and empathise with in care. And what about the child's view of their mother? As someone to imitate, eventually protect, or something else?

A far better language to learn if you are getting into programming is python. It can has simple syntax, is powerful, is actively used and has a feature set that makes learning the underlying programming concepts much easier.

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/may/27/bedroom-tax-poor-homeless

c &amp; d) ""David Cameron told Andrew Marr the weekend before the [2010] general election that a Conservative government would not cut any front-line services:

What I can tell you is, any cabinet minister, if I win the election, who comes to me and says: ""Here are my plans,"" and they involve front-line reductions, they'll be sent straight back to their department to go away and think again. After 13 years of Labour, there is a lot of wasteful spending, a lot of money that doesn't reach the front line.

Since then, 5,870 NHS nurses, 7,968 hospital beds, a third of ambulance stations, 5,362 firefighters and 6,800 frontline police officers have been cut.""

http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/11/pre-election-pledges-tories-are-trying-wipe-internet

e) It's not the only metric. Ask any nurse or front-line NHS staff how absolutely squeezed they are. I know several, and they all say the same thing. They're doing their best in understaffed, underfunded hospitals. Go into A&amp;E (if you can find one that hasn't closed) and see for yourself.

f) Check your privilege. Some people have things better than others. It isn't as simple as ""Get more skills"". That's also not an excuse for employers not paying a living wage. The minimum wage is not a living wage - which often means that workers have to top up their income with benefits. The taxpayer is effectively subsidising the employment costs of many businesses. Is that right?

http://imgur.com/a/s4C3p

g) No it's not. That's a strawman argument.

I'm not saying life isn't fair, I'm saying society isn't fair. There are things about life that cannot be made fair, but there are things about society that can, and should be made fair.

c) Ok thanks for the citation. Does staffing rates convert to absolute efficiency or relative care? That's what I am concerned about. Despite the decline in body count, I've seen a noticeable increase in local care quality.

e) I worked for the NHS for 3 years. I've been in A&amp;E many times, I know many NHS staff and the front line staff are overstretched but this is due to a combination of constant restructure, reorganisation and this one is going to hurt, general incompetence across the board. Not because of cuts. They're cutting the staff because they're inefficient.

My uncle demands £80k a year to manage the finance department of his local PCT. That's the problem with the public sector work.

f) That's the crazy mix of socialism and capitalism we have here. It needs to go one way or another. Under pure socialism, wages are standardised so there is no option for businesses to underpay. Under capitalism, there is competition for staff which drives wages up. if you mix the two, capitalism exploits socialism.

g) It is indeed a strawman. That was the intention. There are only strawman arguments to this problem which is the problem.

I'm saying the same, but I'm also saying is that at the moment there is no possibility to mandate absolute fairness without punishing people.

I do help people and am very compassionate but you have to understand I don't do that for personal gain or glory so don't promote it. The best help you can give is help a person to help themselves.

null,false,Timmeh7,cnty-wales,Swansea,null,"I'm a lecturer dealing a good amount with the admission of disabled students.  Probably from the opposite end to you; an institution which makes extremely good use of the DSA.  The DSA in its current incarnation has an amazing amount of scope for provision.  As an example, one of our students is nearly entirely deaf, so the DSA pays for a remote stenographer who watches and listens via Skype, and transcribes the lecturer verbatim in real time for the student to read, for all of his lectures and tutorials.  It's my opinion that that student is able to have a relatively normal university experience with this provision; he can actually interact with the lecture, ask questions and receive a real-time answer to which he can follow up if necessary.  He will, however, be legitimately disadvantaged compared with his peers, with this provision taken away.

This situation raises an unfortunate point, going back to the tuition fee changes of 2012.  The university system went from a model of being significantly state funded, to one in which students foot nearly the entire bill for their eduction.  Universities have to turn a profit to keep the lights on, and academic staff in employment - if we don't recruit enough students to at least break even, the doors close.  We desperately want to accommodate disabled students, but the financial framework for it is simply no longer there; we have to reconcile our duty of care to disabled students with the realities of the financial model we're working in.  

The legal provision which must be made for a disabled student is a ""reasonable adjustment"", a nuanced legal term for minor to moderate changes to normal operating procedure to accommodate a student's disabilities.  The majority of what the DSA provisions goes well beyond reasonable adjustments, but universities, with all the will in the world, will struggle to provide the same level of support.

Of course, we'll do our best; expand our centralised pools of note takers, employ more support workers (who were previously DSA funded), but we'll be moving towards generalised rather than specialised support.  Hawking's quite right; it's the students with severe disabilities who'll suffer most, as universities do their best to make adjustments, but ultimately within the realities of our financial constraints.",null,0,null,1433069894,null,0,false,0,crqq9ng,null,t3_37wbqy,null,t1_crqq9ng,null,t1_crqo5oy,null,null,null,1433495818,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

&gt; * Corrupt FIFA Guy #1 wired a million dollars to Corrupt FIFA Guy #2 for bribes.
&gt; * Bedraggled European Bank cleared the wire transfer for them.
&gt; * Bedraggled European Bank never asked Corrupt FIFA Guys a question to the effect of ""hey this isn't for bribes is it?""
&gt; * In failing to ask that question, Bedraggled European Bank ignored obvious red flags, like the fact that everyone has known FIFA was corrupt forever. 
&gt; * U.S. prosecutors will charge Bedraggled European Bank with wire fraud for knowingly facilitating bribery and money laundering.
&gt; * Prosecutors will demand a guilty plea and a massive fine, and hold a press conference saying ""this was the UEFA Champions League quarterfinal of fraud and we have ruled Bedraggled European Bank offside.""

Onto Motorbikes; A provisional license alone grants you nothing when it comes to bikes. You must first complete a CBT (compulsory basic training) course which just teaches you the absolute basics. From there, you're allowed to ride anything under 125cc on your own so long as you're displaying L plates (I know plenty of people who get CBT's but have no reason to actually take a full test). Your CBT expires after 2 years and you must complete a full test in order to ride anything larger then 125cc, on the motorway or with a pillion passenger.

Personal ""conspiracy"" theory: Murdoch is a neocon. The Neocons want America leading the world without anyone challenging them, including Europe. As long as Britain is in the EU, it will be an obstacle to further integration. So, run anti-EU stories as long as Britain is in to keep the ""scepticism"" up, switch to pro-EU for a short time to ensure Britain's continued membership.

I think from looking at Murdoch's media empire it is rather clear that he can be called a neocon, even without me providing a source for that statement.

The idea is that by renting from the private sector, central and local government can avoid the liabilities of property ownership while ticking the dogmatic box of 'letting the market set price levels'. The issue seems to be that real wages are not rising, prices are skyrocketing and people are increasingly unable to afford shelter because it is deliberately not reflected in the inflation figures.

&gt;I agree that someone not in work shouldn't be doing better than someone in work. But what you do about families that are already in this place I don't know. Maybe have transitional rules so no one new goes above £23k or whatever it is, but those already there are slowly moved down to avoid massive change. 

I agree. Transitional rules would be the best way to go. Put a deadline on being able to claim benefits for additional children over two or three, something like the 01/01/2016, similarly graduate the changes for housing.

The Tories announced their intention for a referendum right when UKIP was beginning to gain 'proper' traction. Their idea was that by offering the people the choice, then UKIP's 'one policy' would be annihilated. 

Cameron was criticised as putting his party before the country, and I believe rightly so. Cameron's announcement was made on the basis of a Conservative majority in the next election. By announcing it as early as he did, it has left the UK in a BREXIT debate for years longer than need be. Uncertainty is not a great thing for an economy. If it was a Conservative policy, and not a Government policy, it should have been announced closer to the election. However, that wasn't good for the Tories, as they wanted to get rid of UKIP's growth well before the election. This is not to say that I don't agree with a referendum, I do, but the way it was handled displayed Cameron is a Tory Party leader first and Prime Minister second. That's wrong.

Cameron will play his cards carefully, in order to try and avoid a backbench rebellion. He will be able to whip his front bench but it doesn't mean they'll be pleased. He'll let Labour lead the Pro-EU debate but strings will be pulled to ensure the pro-EU debate gets the greatest say.

I wouldn't be surprised if Cameron is already considering handing over power before the next election. The EU debate will potentially kill off yet another Tory party leader.

He doesn't have the instincts to drop into the right position, he can't bully center backs, and he can't finish. 

Ings would solve the issues Sterling has. He has a strikers awareness of the spaces to drop into, he can cause issues for center backs and he can finish. But also, he does press very hard all game. 

Now I know this post is about Benteke, but your whole point is you want a player like this instead of him, which we are getting in Ings. 

I'm actually okay with us getting Benteke for a few reasons too. We sorely lack any physical presence upfront, it's bites us hard so many times when teams set up defensively and we have lots of small technical players who get bullied. 

We lose to teams like Villa, Stoke, Palace because they tighten up at the back and bully our midfield and run at our exposed defense. 

If we actually have a player who will cause teams hassle and bully defenders, we will already be a much better team. Now why Benteke for this role?

Because he isn't a target man. He's big and strong, yes. But he's also quick and hard working. He will beat defenders for pace and keep up with our wingers, he will get on the end of their crosses by knowing where to be. He will also press properly as proved by his times at Villa. Importantly he gives Migs a target from goal kicks too, as we just lose the ball near enough every time at the moment. 

He's still only 24, and I think he is a truly good player who if we do get the most of will be absolutely incredible and just what we need. 

Pairing him up with Sturridge or Ings IS exactly what we need. They will trouble defenses to no end, which is what we're missing. 

We've seen what having the presence of Lambert has had on games, it actually helps us open up defenses. The issue is Lambert can't keep up with our system. Now I see you cry but Mario doesn't work either. Mario doesn't work because he doesn't press intelligently or drop into the right positions to score, he's not a good goal scorer, Benteke is just that.

I'm with the committee or whoever is after Benteke on this one. I actually think he would be great for us. ",null,0,null,1433074241,null,0,false,0,crqr9sa,null,t3_37y6yl,null,t1_crqr9sa,null,t3_37y6yl,null,null,null,1433496291,null,13,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,13,null

As we said here in better times, there's a strong spine, it just needs to get rid of the wasters and dead wood and replace with quality team players, though that may be difficult, we don't really have an insight into how the dressing room personalities work or how long and how much the contracts are for (No club would buy out Gabby's contract so we're stuck with him, for example...)",null,0,null,1433074743,null,0,false,0,crqrejt,null,t3_37vjnm,null,t1_crqrejt,null,t3_37vjnm,null,null,null,1433496354,null,2,false,avfc,t5_2s569,2,null

Your answer completely ignores the legal status side of things. As someone with a work permit, will I be living with the constant fear of one wrong step and I'm out? If I lose my job, am I out? If I become a citizen, do I lose all of my EU rights? Does UK citizenship mean I would lose the right to up and leave and work freely elsewhere?

What about people who have settled here and want to bring relatives to help raise the family, currently it's possible, but in future it would not be? That's a major thing for people who are planning to live here permanently.

And finally, the ""EU passport"" is a critical element in people getting work in Europe. When given two equally qualified applicants, every EU company will hire the EU citizen. Every time. I am not so certain you will find it so easy to find work on the continent.

If you're legally here already, nope.

&gt;If I lose my job, am I out?

If you are legally here already, nope.

If it is someone who has come since on a work permit and they can't find another job.  Then yes, if you can't find work and you've come here for work, then in future people coming to the UK (not those that have already come) would require a work permit, like all those other developed countries that require a work permit.

&gt;If I become a citizen, do I lose all of my EU rights? Does UK citizenship mean I would lose the right to up and leave and work freely elsewhere?

Dual citizenship is allowed in the UK.

&gt;What about people who have settled here and want to bring relatives to help raise the family, currently it's possible, but in future it would not be? 

        ""Britain should be able to adopt a non-discriminatory
         immigration policy, treating EU and non-EU citizens 
         on an equal footing.""

Is essentially the argument.  It will be just as possible as someone legally here able to bring their family across, as many in the Commonwealth have done when you look at the doctors and nurses we've brought over from the likes of South Africa, India, and Pakistan.

Same non-discriminatory policy.

&gt;And finally, the ""EU passport"" is a critical element in people getting work in Europe. When given two equally qualified applicants, every EU company will hire the EU citizen. Every time. I am not so certain you will find it so easy to find work on the continent.

Fear-mongering.   

Go into London.

We don't see there that the person with the EU passport is hired every single time as it is the most cosmopolitan city in the world.  Non-EU people are competing with EU passport holding people, and doing it very well.

Now go to Australia.  They don't hire the guy with the Australian passport first every single time.  They actually facilitate competition with the Australian passport with their points based system.  What we don't do is export unskilled labour into weaker currencies with weaker job markets.  UK migration is more skilled or company based.

Why you'd want to project the EU being this ultra-protectionist state and that somehow they'd run things differently is beyond me.

What I do know is a French Parisian in finance who had moved into local government told me that they'd held a study into it and that i the local UK business left the local economy would collapse.   And you only have to walk around to see it because the type of UK migration to the continent has been considerably different.  Much more self-employed or financially independent.  Might not seem terribly fair, but it is terribly practical.  If I have to fill out a work visa, well, nobody ever moved to France because they wanted less bureaucracy and paperwork.  It's a little extra to a lot I already have to do.  No biggy.

Right but the French have no vote on the UK leaving. All this proves is nobody wants the UK to leave, which they don't. You seem to be assuming that the EU will allow Britain to leave, and then simply continue as normal. They clearly won't do this, as it sets an awful precedent.

The point is you're too far to the left to reason with.  Nobody talks about ""full employment"" any more besides the economically illiterate.  The fact is, 7 kids is too many to bring up on a wide range of wages.  Certainly it is too many kids to bring up on Asda wages.

&gt;They are hardly institutionalized scammers. 

I never called them scammers, but they are horribly irresponsible people.  Most people are the architects of their own situation, be it poor, middle class or otherwise.  Just because you're poor that doesn't mean you're a victim.  Everyone is capable of bettering themselves, but not everyone chooses to do so.

&gt;So what, should people like this have no children in case they get made redundant

How about only having 1, 2 or maybe 3?  

As usual everyone is a victim of the system.  This sort of hokum is why labour got destroyed in the election.  Very, very few people in this country are victims.  

&gt;They caused their own problem 100%,

They did.  You don't have seven children by accident.  Their fault.

The most recent general election result suggests to me that it's you that don't get it.  The champagne socialists are finally going out of fashion.  Good riddance.

Why is it OK for them to make extremely stupid decisions just because they are poor?  Having seven children, of which you can only really afford maybe one or two, is stupid isn't it?

The referendum question is:

    Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?

i.e. ""Yes"" means stay in the EU, and ""business as usual"" (ignoring any reform negotiations).

I am not doing the same board as you, but I can give you some more information on the Berlin Blockade. 

As you know after WW2 Berlin was split into 2 halves, East and West. Berlin was in the heart of Soviet controlled East Germany, and Stalin didn't want Allies deep in the communist territory. The west deliberately made their half of Berlin a prosperous demonstration of the affluent capitalist lifestyle, and it was a ""capitalist island in a communist sea"". 

Stalin accused the west of interfering in the Soviet zone, and cut off road, rail and canal traffic, attempting to force the allies to pull out of their sections. However, Truman was determined to stand up to the Soviet Union and wanted Berlin to be a symbol of freedom behind the Iron Curtain. Therefore the Allies decided to airlift supplies from their bases in the west to Berlin. At its peak, a flight was landing in West Berlin every 90 seconds. 

The soviets did not shoot down allied craft because Truman had positioned bombers capable of carrying atom bombs in Britain in range of the USSR, and so he was hesitant in case he would spark world war.

Whether anything has changed or not, I don't know, but buying and selling a bike is fairly easy in these big cities. GET THE BLUE CARD. GET THE BLUE CARD. That's like your kinda-sorta ownership card.


Didn't book a tour. I was comfortable with an offline GPS (android- MapFactor Navigator) taking me around.


In the north, avoid route 1 at all costs. Head west, straight for the mountains and follow that down until, i think the town is called Buon Ma Thot-famous for coffee apparently, and thats where you can cut in towards the Hai Van Pass. That kinda area, halfway down.


I went to Nha Trang, Da Lat, Mui Ney (sp?), then onto Ho Chi Ming, with other places dotted in between.


Here's some tips: Don't panic- there are people, food, and lodgings everywhere.

Don't over plan. Go with the flow.

Rest often. Once an hour. Drink water!

Take pictures of things which make you go ""Whoa"".

Don't piss off the police or locals.

Get lost!! You'll remember the 2 hour dirt road where your forearm burned from clutch usage more than that smooth, boring highway.

Python is by far the best to learn at the moment - perhaps in the future Julia or something will eclipse it and Haskell can be fun because it's so weird to write, but Python is just the best overall. Although I like that Ruby doesn't use the whitespace which can be rather irritating in Python.

The reason whoscored ratings don't matter, and the reason people are idiots for citing them (and might as well be citing Fifa) is the fact that they are very, very flawed. The points attributed for a goal or an assist often outway a very poor performance for example, the way assists are counted in the first place is very dubious, and that's just the attacking part of the game. Maldini once said that the best defenders don't have to make a tackle, because their positioning has thwarted the threat before having to make a tackle, where's the algorithm for that? A defender playing for a relegation threatened team will typically have to make more tackles/blocks/headers because of poor team cohesion in front of him, it doesn't mean his last-ditch efforts make him a good defender, it means the players in front of him aren't offering the right support or that his positioning is bad in the first place. I could go on but that's enough to render their ratings 100% redundant for me.

A subjective opinion of a fan who has actually watched the player is worth far more to me than an meaningless arbitrary stat plucked out of a flawed algorithm that will never be able to accurately represent a players ability.

Here's a good example - take the case of 'Muslim rape gangs'.  Five years ago, if someone had told you about the problem of Pakistani rape gangs you'd likely have suspected them of being racist or neofascist.  And they may well have been either of those two!  I think many decent people would have categorized such talk as obvious hate-speech, of the type they'd like to see banned.  After all, if accusing the muslim population of harboring rape gangs is not incitement to hatred, then what is?

I think the reality is that neither Scotland nor the remaining UK would end up substantially better or worse off financially.

Ultimately I think it's something that the people of Scotland need to decide based on other factors.  Scotland and England tend to have different political leanings, and the English vote goes a long way to determining the UK government.

The children doing these things often don't have the same kinds of access to things that the children who grow up to be successful do. I am very aware that I was lucky to have the parents I had: they cared immensely about education, would always buy me books whenever I asked (within reason: we were quite poor), and allowed me free reign of the Internet and let me play with computers.

I don't think that I would have succeeded without these things. I never would have cultivated an interest in science, my (written) language skills would never have advanced if I hadn't spent hours writing things on Internet forums.

It's a systemic problem. The largest single contributing factor is a lack of money, followed by a lack of time, followed by that nebulous concept 'poverty of aspiration'. At my school teachers rarely suggested that, for example, a student might want to become a doctor or a lawyer or a scientist or anything really, it was all about 'getting your C grades'.

Every so often a teacher would throw a bone to one of the ~5 students who might go to university but the overall feeling is 'we can't do those things'. I remember one day in year 11 when we were talking about 'the future' in one of our classes I said, seriously, 'I am going to work in regenerative medicine' (a field which didn't really exist then but wevs I knew it was going to happen) and the response I got from the rest of my class was just complete disbelief.

For a long time I thought it was directed at me personally. Because they said 'you could never be a scientist'. Except then I realised it wasn't aimed at me: the implication was that no one from our area could do that because barely anyone got to university in the first place. It's just this pervasive idea that this shitty life is all that's possible, and it comes from parents, the environment, and even teachers.

It's not just a case of 'well move!' - people on benefits don't have that luxury. Uprooting your kids from school, childcare, friends, local community just breaks the meaning of what that benefit is for. You can't expect someone to just relocate their entire life because a blanket, country wide cap is bought in.

It's not like the government just GIVES you 23k and you stick it in a bank and laugh at everyone. Nearly all of that money goes back in to the system - it's then taxed BACK to them. Housing agencies do look to push people in to cheaper rents but the government won't do anything to stop unscrupulous landlords charging astronomical prices for rent who know they can get away with it. I've got friends nearby who pay £1250 a month for their 1 bed flat and it has a garden. Upstairs which is slightly smaller - the landlord who's constantly absent, won't repair ANYTHING and owns many other places, charges £1800 to someone with mental issues on incapacity benefits. They asked the council why it was allowed to happen and they were quite happy to say 'it's very common, we have no powers to enforce prices or responsibilities above the absolute minimum'. Why should he be allowed to get fat off the system for neglecting his duties because there's no laws in place, no policing and the council couldn't care less.

Winning cups with rubbish teams isn't something that happens very often. It's not the barometer against which success is measured.

Dortmund were a fantastic team but the place the club is in dictated that it was always going to be a short term success - the mice playing while the big cat was away.

Im paying mine back now, its pre taxed and without my degree i wouldn't have even got an interview for my job.

I think the fundamental problem is saturation of certain degree fields and disciplines.

I apologise for making an off-topic reply, but it's not really true to say that a cycle courier is ""their own boss"".

Cycle-couriers are technically self-employed (unless they've changed the law since my day), but that's really only a dodge to avoid paid holidays and other employment legislation.

When a bank, lawyer or architect needs something delivered by same-day courier, it's because it's urgent and it needs to be there today - otherwise they'd just put in the post.

Consequently the courier company doesn't get to turn down jobs it doesn't fancy, and it expects its riders not to, either. 

Like technical support (and I guess many other industries), courier companies are driven by peak capacity - they need enough riders so that they can meet demand on a busy Friday.

If you're an experienced courier (i.e. fast and capable) then you could almost certainly find a courier company who would take you on part-time to cover Fridays only, because Fridays are when demand peaks. 

Part-time riders are of no interest to courier companies on other days because then demand is lower, and all their full time riders can cover the work.

Where the self-employed nature of couriering comes into this is that riders are paid by the job, and the company explicitly *doesn't want part timers who don't work peak periods*, because that takes jobs out of the mouths of their main team. Because the peak team can cover off-peak work so easily, an off-peak part-timer would effectively be depriving the full-time riders of wages.

I don't feel I've explained this very well, but I hope it makes sense.

I've known riders who can deliver 10 jobs in the west end in an hour - that's as many an an inexperienced rider could do in a day. An additional inexperienced rider would be no use at peak periods - just communicating with them would be more hassle than they're worth. An inexperienced rider is a drain on the circuit, and only tolerated in the expectation that they're going to become a full member of the team.

If you really want to be a cycle courier, then go out and cycle 50 miles a day for the next 2 weeks. Then you can walk into any courier company in London and say ""screw you, I can prove it to you"".

The key to being a successful courier is to be out every day, your full 10 hours, rain or shine, and never turn down a job - never argue on the radio or try to enter into discussions with your controller. Controllers are under considerable pressure and they have a lot to think about, so they don't want to be burdened with your problems - your goal should be to make only 3 calls kinds of calls: ""roger"", ""job on board"" and ""empty"".

as i said, it was a lazy search to find the books i read last year. i don't really need to persuade you i've read them. and as i said, the point i'm making isn't considered contentious in modern academia, so i don't really feel the need to demonstrate it in much detail to you.

EDIT: actually nah, i am being unfair here. maybe you genuinely do need it demonstrating that white artists have benefited unfairly from the appropriation of black music, so here we go, quick rundown of the ideas.

so Borrowed Power opens by examining 'swing music' in the 1930s and that despite the music being created and popularised by black musicians, it was popularised and commercialised by white musicians leading mostly white bands, whilst the original black innovators and creators were left uncompensated and unknown, for the most part.

he highlights benny goodman, hailed as ""the king of swing"" and generally performing with an all white band. do you think it's fair that the man most commercially successful and considered ""the king of swing"" was white? ziff also points out that he bought many of his compositions from black musicians, yet they did not find the same fame for these compositions.

later in the book he talks about the black bands finding their own markets, touring for mostly black audiences. this was the 1930s remember, so the landscape was still segregated and jim crow still existed.

this is the basic model for african-american appropriation - african americans create an innovative musical form, swing, blues, jazz, rock n roll, hip hop etc and then white commercial interests (the music industry) co-opt these ideas, consciously or not, and promote white musicians interpretations of these musical forms, until they are the most visible performers in the genre. think Sinatra, Elvis, Eminem.

obviously this isn't always accurate as it's a complex process involving different groups of people, but you can certainly see why people are making allusions to this historical process in the contemporary music industry - the most famous and successful hip hop performers of today, in terms of both awards and sales are Iggy Azalea and Macklemore. I think this is because the same process has taken place, black musical ideas (DJ Mustard's production in the case of Iggy Azalea's 'Fancy') has been taken and repurposed for a white performer as it sells better. you don't agree though.",null,0,null,1433082853,null,0,1433084198,0,crqu2b6,null,t3_37n7su,null,t1_crqu2b6,null,t1_crqtszb,null,null,null,1433497607,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I thought back to my time supporting Villa in earnest (from around the age of 7/8 - around 99/00) and actually, we've always been losers. Even when we've been winning, we're losers. Lets look at it in detail. Some of the earlier memories are hazier as I was younger then.
 
2000 - FA cup final against a side that weren't that much better than us, but we didn't turn up and lost. Could have been a huge day for our fans but our club lost.
 
Most of the 00's (under RL) - We became a team that were perfectly happy to sit in upper mid table, not make any waves in the transfer market or the cups)
 
Now for the main point of my post, and one I can actually write with more detail and recollection based on my own personal experiences.
 
2006 - Lerner takes over and this is it. We are not going to be losers anymore. We are going to be winners. We had MON as our manager. A winner. This is going to be good.
 
2009 - We had barely made it through the group stages of the Europa league having lost to European giants MSK Zilina at home, but we'd made it. Fantastic, lets make a run at it. But no, we take a severely weakened team to Moscow and throw the tie. Winners don't throw matches. We all know what happened next. We drew to Stoke and having been 3rd place in February, ended up finishing 6th. It should have been one of the best seasons in recent history, but it wasn't to be. Even when times are good for our club, we still manage to show what losers we are.
 
2010 - Losing to Rapid Vienna in the prelim round of the Europa league set the tone for the rest of the season with regards to being losers. We lost at Wembley twice. We can blame Dowd all we like, but we lost another final. We were losers again.
 
2011 - We appointed Alex McLeish and it became apparent that the club's goal was to stay in the PL and nothing more. Not a winner's attitude is it?
 
2012-15 - All funding cut back. Lambert appointed with the sole aim of keeping the club in the division. Bringing in young and hungry players wasn't the worst idea, but when you bring them into a club full of losers, what do they become? 
 
Yesterday completely summed it up for me. We are a club full of losers. Sherwood has it spot on about the players but the problem goes far, far deeper. We won't ever win anything while the entire club has this attitude. The chairman is a loser, the players are losers, it's too early to say whether Sherwood is a loser, the staff are losers, the fans are losers; everything and everyone to do with this football club is a loser.
 
It isn't Lerner's, Lambert's, Faulker's, the player's faults; they weren't losers before they came here. Absolutely none of them has done anything to try to change that mentality though. Lerner with his ridiculous funding and pathetic expectations. Lambert with his backwards tactics, negative approaches to big games and mumbling. The players just not showing up when they really needed to. I'm saddened by yesterday but it was totally expected. The club can't even be expected to turn up for an FA cup final, never mind try to win it. It's the mentality of the entire club that's the problem.

This comes from a supposedly morally superior way of life. I don't know how people have came to that assumption. Y'know the bible says that if your wife gets involved in a fight between you and another guy, and if she punches the other dude in the balls that you have to cut her hand off? Why the fuck would I live my life according to that?

The Christian answer to that is nearly always: *hmm*, *haaa*... we don't take everything seriously... *hmmmm* they weren't supposed to be taken seriously, *hmmm* it's open for interpretation. No. It's not, it straight up says to cut her hand off. Fuck that.

There's also the fact that for an all benevolent God, the fact that he's made insects that sole reason for surviving is to feed off of humans, turning them blind, spreading disease etc - pretty fucking scummy and ruthless to me for someone who loves everyone even in their failings. Y'know God in the Bible kills like, millions of people throughout all those stories, and Lucifer kills fucking zero? Lucifer gives humans self-awareness whereas God preferred when we were half-alive dumbasses? The fuck is benevolent in that? If anyone deserves praise its the devil.

I witnessed my da die over the period of a year to a high grade brain tumour, I saw him have seizures - I was there when he woke up and didn't know who his wife and sons were. He died not knowing who I - his 11yr old son - was. He couldn't string together a sentence, couldn't balance or feed himself, was in constant pain. A 38yr old father of 3 children. 13yr old boy, 11yr old boy, and an 11month old boy. 35 year old newly widowed mother of three. We spent every penny of our considerable savings, and relied on the help of family and friends to help raise more money through charity nights - in the end we got around £60,000 if I remember right, to send him over for experimental private treatment that looked promising in the US. It failed, leaving us broke, widowed and fatherless. I went to bed hungry multiple times a night, my big brother started drinking and taking all sorts at about 15yrs old - I suffered from depression and tried to take my own life on more than one occasion, I still get bouts of it now and again. My mother was (and still is) suffering from depression and takes medication for it - I fell asleep manys a night as a child to the sounds of her crying her lamps out downstairs and knowing there was absolutely nothing I could do to help.

I just don't think you're being rational about this. 

&gt;If you are wanting to leave the EU, I struggle to see how you can claim to see yourself as European.

Because they're two separate concepts. Europe is either a geographical description or a cultural/ethnic group of peoples - by both these definitions Britain is part of Europe, and the vast majority of us recognise this. It's a tiny minority who would say that we're not European.

But just because Britain is European it does not follow that we should have a political union. ~~African countries do not live under an African Union, but the fact that they do not want to 'pool' their sovereignty in such a way does not mean they hate each other: they trade with each other, co-operate, etc. And they all see themselves as Africans.~~
 Besides the point.

I'm not even sure where I stand on the EU personally, but telling me that considering leaving the European Union means the British either hate Europeans or don't consider themselves part of Europe or Europeans themselves is nonsensical and actually pretty offensive. We don't hate Europe or its people, as I said the vast majority see ourselves as Europeans. There's just growing skepticism about the political union - we were happy to trade and co-operate, but it's a British tradition and value stretching back many centuries that ultimately power should reside in our parliament - where *we* elect *our* representatives to represent *us*. And that's coming into conflict with this notion that sovereignty no longer lies with us but with the EU.

It's a no-brainer. You want as many people in your society as possible to be highly educated. Every college degree helps save on all kinds of social costs while increasing income, creating a higher standard of living, and generating tax revenue. We can spend a larger part of our tax revenue on college tuition grants which help us in the long term or we can continue to spend it on welfare, prisons, and benefit programs which do not help us in the long term. Not to mention the boost to technology, research &amp; development, and innovation that is likely to come out of a larger portion of the population having advanced degrees.

Big picture people, c'mon! European countries that offer free college for those who qualify are going to leave us (Edit: I'm in the United States) in the dust!

Well originally is WAS - but not any more. Benefits used to come from NI - but not any more. If you're getting this 'free money' it's still going back to the government.

VAT is 20%. You need to buy a new fridge or washing machine the government is taking 20% of it back off you. They raised it temporarily and it's not been bought back down. Pay electricity or gas - taxed, drink a pint - taxed, own a phone - taxed, work in a very low paid job council taxed - in fact on average the poorest households pay as much as 36% of their income towards taxes back to the government. Even the ONS says that Britain's tax system is one of the most unfair in Europe.

Yes, and no. It depends on the avenue you take to get to Citizenship.

For non-EU, a pre-requisite to citizenship is a visa without time limitations. i.e. Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR). ILR requires the Life in the UK test.  

I guess for an EU (non-UK) to UK citizenship, the pre-requisite of visa-without-time-limitations is already fulfilled by EU membership. Therefore they can apply for citizenship, but they will need to do the life test for the citizenship application.

Guardiola STILL won the quadruple. It takes talent to do that no matter what plus he has the experience. He is still one of the best managers around.

- Poor tactics, poor subs, poor lineups

- The fact we went into this season with **four** strikers and yet we started most matches without a single one of them in the lineup. Of course, it would've been different if Studge was fit, but the fact we went into the season (and worse, came out of January) with 1 crocked striker and the other 3 that our manager doesn't like is shocking from a management POV

- Crap atmosphere

- United finishing ahead of us. Fuck.

- Spurs finishing ahead of us. Fuckity fuck. That's even more embarrassing.

- Falling apart at the seams for the THIRD time immediately after finishing 2nd in the Prem (2002/03, 2009/10, 2014/15)

- I've lost all confidence in Rodgers. I hate that I have, but I have. I want him gone before better managers decide to go elsewhere, and I never ever thought I'd say that.

- We couldn't even muster up half decent performances for either of Gerrard's last two matches

- The amount of times I've used the word 'disgusting' to talk about our performances this season was too damn high. From March to May it seemed like a weekly occurance.

I think you've just missed the point I'm making.

In any conversation about the EU, ""European"" means ""citizen of the EU"", which is an organisation with shared ideals, free movement and political union. In those terms, ""European"" definitely means something in terms of your countries political ideology. It is the commonly accepted meaning, but OK in future I will specify.

In geographical terms ""European"" just means we all come from the same continent. It means nothing in terms of political ideology.

And you can't be annoyed that people will be pissed off if you leave the EU, Britain is essentially telling the other 26 countries it doesn't agree with their ideology anymore and making itself an outsider. You cannot deny this, and try to say to people ""we think you're all fucking wrong, but lets still be cool""

More than caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and medication are stated to be exempt. [Food](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/blanket-ban-to-clamp-down-on-legal-highs) is stated to be automatically exempt, including drinks, and anything permitted as a food additive by the European Union will also be exempt.

It will even have a clause that let's healthcare professionals with a legitimate need to keep them, somewhat dispelling even [David Nutt's](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/29/psychoactive-substances-ban-end-brain-research-britain-david-nutt) concerns. Though, his synthetic alcohol project will still fail over it.

The bill will go through the Commons and Lords, and it will be debated on. People will bring these things up, and they will add other clauses to the bill as it goes through parliament. All they've really done at the moment is a *first draft* of the bill. Yes, the wording is dumb. The whole ""everything is banned unless we say otherwise"" approach is also more than iffy, but these issues will be predominately ironed out as it progresses through the House.

Out of all the proposed legislation to call the government out on, this is one of the feast appropriate. There are billions of pounds in cuts coming to the vaguest of *somewheres*, the Snooper's Charter, the ""right to buy"" on Housing Association properties, potential censorship through Ofcom, and a poorly worded draft of a bill to make legal highs illegal.

The Raspberry Pi may seem impressively low-cost option, you need a monitor/TV, keyboard, mouse, USB wifi dongle, and SD card to get started. Oh, and you probably need access to a real PC to get it set up, too. And then it's a slow device with a somewhat limited version of Linux.

**are you fucking kidding me?**

Are you stable? you seem to be veering wildly in and out of reality here. I assume you are some tory boy, daily mail reading simpleton so even you should understand that full employment or aiming for it is much more desirable than not.

Oh yeah and your precious Tories recently wrote into their queens speech they were aiming for full employment. 
**LOL**
http://cesi.org.uk/social-inclusion-news/2015/may/queen%E2%80%99s-speech-promises-full-employment-and-further-devolution-powers

*Under the Full Employment and Welfare Benefits Bill, the Queen announced that ‘Legislation will be brought forward to help achieve full employment and provide more people with the security of a job*'

Oh fucking dear. 

But anyway, if full employment is now for the economically illiterate, then we must accept a permanent unemployed class or as marx put it the reserve army of labour to keep wage inflation under control.
But we cant have them starve or start looting so they are kept as a reserve army of unemployed labour on the **welfare state**, its no secret that thatcher used the welfare state to this end during her reign. 

But wait, you dont agree with welfarism do you? so what the fuck do you propose? starving? executions? exile?  workhouses? 

If youre against full employment at least have the nous to understand that even the fascists on the right accept that it is essential to prevent disorder and revolution in a world with job scarcity.

I don't see why people are so opposed to paedophiles - offenders or not - being chemically castrated? If you're a non-offending paedophile, I would assume you're a non-offender because you have the morality to realize that abusing children is wrong. Yet, as paedophilia is like any other sexual attraction - you can't change it without castration - whether they act on their urges or not, they will still feel these urges and I can imagine that results in a great deal of stress. 

Surely, castrating non-offending paedophiles will take this weight off their shoulders and allow them to live a more fulfilling life, and also ensure the maximum safety of others around them? (Because a 'non-offender' + the depression which likely ensues from being unable to act on one's sex drive + many cans of alcoholic beverage consumed to nullify the depression + a child in the immediate vicinity of the now drunk and thus impulsive 'non offender' = bad things...)

Of course, I would advocate regular counselling sessions alongside the castration process, and we do need to destigmatize attitudes towards non offending paedophiles, so that they feel confident enough to approach a medical professional for help... But ultimately, if one is exclusively attracted to children I feel castration is the only option.

null,false,DeusBex,null,null,null,"The socio-economic situation at present in the UK means that, unless you're happy in menial trade or low-skill work like a Tesco cashier, university is almost a downright necessity. Employment in some areas is still scarce and, when you've got Costa shops having a few thousand applicants for just ten positions, it becomes apparently necessary to have the best possible qualifications. In that sense, it isn't right to charge students as they often don't have the choice. If you want to get to high-ranking positions in our society, then university is a must and charging people for the sheer ability to just succeed in life is ludicrous.

Furthermore, as others have said, there are other benefits to university. UKIP's own polls show they are unpopular amongst university students, which in my opinion shows how these years are important for broadening an individual's horizons and embracing different cultures. You're in an environment often with many international students, or simply people from different economic, social or religious backgrounds to yourself, and I think this helps to widen your outlook on life immensely. Whereas your school or sixth-form was only children in your local area, your classmates at university could be all the way from China even. Many universities are also now offering a third-year abroad with many degrees, which has untold benefits. Living abroad for a year can improve your independence, confidence in meeting new people, ability to adapt to other cultures, and so forth. These are all invaluable skills.

University is also important as a social event. Many people might scoff at this, sure, but university is a time of trying new things. Many students join societies and find new sports, which is all good and healthy. I know of people who really benefited from meeting new people and trying new things, being away from their home and comfort zone where they might simply repeat the same things daily.

Finally, education benefits society. Those who are educated are likely to earn more, which in turn means less people on welfare and greater tax income. Higher earners are also, generally speaking, happier. Money might not buy happiness, sure, but living in poverty is simply stressful and depressing. I'd wager that an individual in such conditions is more likely to turn to drink or drugs too, which in turn is a weight upon the NHS.",null,0,null,1433086617,null,0,false,0,crqvpot,null,t3_37ydm8,null,t1_crqvpot,null,t3_37ydm8,null,null,null,1433498384,null,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24,null

A lot of safe things are already specifically permitted by UK and EU legislation to be consumed as food additives.

It will also depend on how the court intends to interpret it, and they are far more level headed than the government. Selling catnip from say a pet store, as it is not intended for human consumption, would not be illegal. But selling it from a store that sold other chemicals, like bath-salts, would probably end up being deemed illegal by the court under this bill (because they either know or ought to know it will be abused.)

There are concerns about the bill, obviously, possibly the biggest one being the idea of how to tell if a substance is ""psychoactive"" without sufficient government testing in the first place.

null,false,rydleo,null,null,null,"Near everything, to be honest.  Starting with last summer which was just appalling.  We bought decent players for the most part, but in positions we didn't need without filling the holes that needed to be filled.  We never got a proper goal scorer which was borderline criminal, didn't get a keeper which we needed, and apparently didn't get a proper holding mid or if Can was that then it would have been nice to see him play there.  The only position we did fill that needed filling was LB and it's debatable that Moreno has been anywhere near good enough.

People go on about 'depth' but I find that to be nonsense.   We have something like 32 potential first team players, which is about 8-14 too many.  Looking at say Chelsea, they had 18 players play 500+ minutes with 11 of those playing 2,000+ minutes, we had 22 over 500+ minutes and only 9 with 2,000+ minutes.  Part of that may be due to injuries, but in general our squad rotation was terrible and we really should be playing with 8 or so 'key' players every game while rotating 1 or 2 each time.

Our style of play was inconsistent and borderline schizophrenic with several games the players looking like they had no idea what was expected of them with the Villa game easily being the most disorganized display I can think of by any PL side in recent years- it was honestly ridiculously bad.

That all said, looking forward to seeing what the summer brings and really hoping next season is better both in terms of performances and results.  We have a good core of players, it's just a matter for me of a couple changes and establishing a style of play that fits those we have and persisting with it and I do think we will see dividends.

Look at my post history and see if I said the same thing about Sturridge. 

Benteke suits Arsenal and Chelsea's style of play. He doesn't suit ours. He is a good player in the right system but not a good fit for us. 

I have watched plenty of Ings and plenty of Vietto and given the choice I'd go for Vietto any day of the week. He's a better player now and has the potential to be world class. Ings is a good hard-working striker and while he would probably do a job for us he won't take us to the next level while Vietto would. Yes, he's being courted by Spurs aswell. He should be, that's his level. We want to compete for titles. 

Nobody accused you of jumping on the bandwagon. I have just given my opinion on two players and you can trawl through my post history if you feel like it. I've consistently said that Ings is not good enough and almost everyone has said that we would need to sign another striker if we signed him. 

Big name players that we've signed. None in the last few years apart from Suarez. But we've been recovering from the disaster of Hicks and Gillette for the last 7-8 years. Torres was the last really big name player that we signed before that. We did sign Andy Carroll for 35m, which is an eerily similar price mooted for Benteke for a very similar player.

Also banks are now taking student debt into account when applying for mortgages so student debt can be a burden on people achieving their goal of buying a house and leaving the crazy rented market we have. 

The state has sold debt onto private companies and student debt seems to be a tax on aspiration which goes into the pockets of private companies owned by the rich. The debt payments are a transfer from the poorer/middle incomes to the rich because the poorer/middle have aspiration to get ahead this is exactly the opposite of how a progressive society should work. The rich should pay more to help everyone gain skills which helps our economy get better jobs and become richer. People always talk about reducing red tape for companies but student debt is red tape for people as they have to continually inform the company of changes in circumstances or be faced with fines.

There is also the philosophical argument that debt is a mechanism to  discipline the population. If you have debts to pay you will take fewer risks and less likely to follow your dreams/change society for the better and more likely to try and earn money to pay off the debt in the prevailing economic paradigm.

null,false,grogleberry,null,null,null,"&gt;Look what Rafa did with a few of the teams he managed in the early 2000s, he made them completely over perform. He hasn't been able to do that in awhile now.
[...]Take our team of 04/05 for example, I very much doubt we were even in the top 8 for favorites to win the CL yet it happened due to amazing management.

I don't agree with your general assessment of what was behind that success and the nature of it.

I don't believe that any manager can consistently make a team overperform.
At Valencia, they won leagues with points totals that wouldn't even get CL this season. Barca finished 20 pts better off this season.

It was a much weaker league and that had to happen before a team such as Rafa's Valencia could ""overperform"". There are far more factors involved than the manager can influence.

Further to that, anomalies happen. 38 games is short enough that a certain bunching of good results for you or against opponents, key injuries, flukey reffing decisions and so forth, can occasionally swing even a league title.

&gt;Alex Ferguson was another who could do the same thing, he was amazing at motivating the players and getting them to play to 110% of their ability.

I certainly don't think that was demonstrated in his time at Utd. They have been the best team in England over the past 25 years with the best attack. Anything less than domestic domination would be bizarre.

Their relatively poor results in Europe when they were the best team in Europe in that period, bar *maybe* Real Madrid, is, I think, testament to the fact that Ferguson *was not* good at getting his team to play above itself.

&gt;I can't even tell if you're being serious anymore. If you really think Benitez is anywhere near as good of a manager now as he was 10-15 years ago then you haven't been paying attention to his recent career.

I don't know what you're expecting of him but it isn't realistic.
Winning Serie A is, just the same as La Liga, the Bundesliga and the PL, in the hands of a select group of clubs.
If those clubs perform, nobody outside that group has a chance.

Atletico's victory last season has been the most successful of those anomalies, but even so, an 87 pt season is below par for clubs like Real and Barca, who've won ever other league for the past 5 years with 94+ points.

Juventus have turned up for his time at Napoli, leaving him no chance at winning the league.

At Chelsea, he fulfilled his brief and got CL qualification after a poor start.

At Inter, they refused to rebuild like he demanded and now they're a footballing irrelevance.

Since leaving Liverpool he's won a Copa Italia, a World Club cup, a UEFA cup and 2 Supercopa Italias.

If you don't manage one of the big boys, you're not going to get consistent success.

I set up an account when I moved in, but they were updating their systems (and were currently using two systems in conjunction - their new + old one). Apparently, I got set-up on the old one but was never transferred to the new one.  
  
I had set-up to get my bills every 3 months - when the first one didn't come, I called up and after a bit of faffle, I was told it would be sorted, and the bill would come in 3 months (inclusive of the previous). This happened 2 more times (despite numerous calls + emails), until I finally lodged a formal complaint.  
  
I somehow got in touch with the head of the complaints department, who oversaw the entire thing. Then they charged me based off a standard rate, when I had applied for a specific tariff ... so beware of that. I pushed to get the original tariff I applied for, and it took another month (lol!) to recalculate my bill. I ended up receiving my bill 2 months later (for the entire year!) with a £600 (roughly 35%) discount for all the problems that had been caused, so I'm not going to complain too much. 

BTW, I got through to the senior complaints department through a direct email to his account. I don't know if you can do the same - the people answering the phones were typically unhelpful and gave me the standard ""Oh I'll just set it up for you now and you'll receive your bill in 3 months, thank you!"".

You see, as you've just shown yourself, certain parts of the right like o paint anyone who stands up to xenophobia as a hypocrite tree huger, while perpetuating the idea that there obviously is a problem, the issue is just the the all powerful political correctness people don't let us discuss it. (Even though the majority of the media is very much repeating the ""there obviously is a problem"" narrative.)

This makes discussing the issue of whether/when immigration is a good thing early impossible. It also severly hampers the fight against xenophobia and racism, which of course occur amongst people of all cultural background and skin colours. And it especially damages the much needed debate on how the rhetoric of the immigration debate, as repeated ad nauseam by the media, give rise to racist sentiments.

Believe it or not I don't want the poorer EU countries having their unskilled workforce being displaced or going through longterm unemployment either.  It's not good for them, and it's turning a back on a whole generation.

UK skilled people, or those with investment or a trade will still be able to work in Europe as they always have done.

&gt;Right but the French have no vote on the UK leaving. All this proves is nobody wants the UK to leave, which they don't.

What it means is that if the UK does leave there won't be any rush to exclude UK people living or working in the EU, because their local economies already rely on them.  That's the point.

&gt;I obviously don't think it is becoming an ultra protectionist state, you are projecting that on to me! I fundamentally disagree.

Then if it's not then it won't be a problem for skilled Brits working, and British companies trading, in the EU after a British exit!

This is a politically-motivated distortion of the truth on your part. By trying to change the definition of 'European' to mean the same thing as 'EU citizen' you can effectively handwave away criticism or opposition to the EU as being the same as opposition to Europe or Europeans. Underhanded.

&gt;And you can't be annoyed that people will be pissed off if you leave the EU, Britain is essentially telling the other 26 countries it doesn't agree with their ideology anymore and making itself an outsider. You cannot deny this, and try to say to people ""we think you're all fucking wrong, but lets still be cool""

Why would this piss them off and why would it be offensive? All we would be saying is ""Best of luck with this, but we can't be a part of it.""

DSA (disabled student allowance) dont look at what you need for your course but just the basics. They dont care what industry you are heading towards, as long as they meet minimum standards, they are happy.  Here are example of what i claimed. I claimed one laptop (Accepted) 3 years later i claimed a new charger as the old one broke (Rejected) . I claimed a monitor to help with CAD design and future practise for software (Rejected). I claimed books on my reading list (Rejected). I claimed inc (Accepted)

I was under the impression DSA is to motivate students with disabilities to go into further education and give them a reward for pursuing a life they want , not that they are given. Because my normal student loan isn't covering accommodation and living i have already resorted to medical trials, which to be fair does make ends meet. But still i don't think a student should have to do this, it just adds pressure onto an already dire situation.

Cook:
- 1kg of the Cheapest pasta available (usually 40p to 60p)
- Tin of chopped tomatoes or passata (35p)
- Four large tins of baked beans (around £1)
- 1kg of frozen mixed vegetables (77p to £1)
- Value loaf of bread (40p to 50p)
- Tin of hot dogs in brine (around 50p for 8 normally)
Assuming the higher costs it comes out at £3.95. I could get lucky and have it come out at £3.42 though, which is another loaf of bread or a couple of tins of beans.

If I'm in a position to cook the pasta, tomatoes, and hot dogs then I'd freeze them because you can get three to four or four meals out of that. Especially if you mix some of the frozen vegetables into it as well - it's not necessarily nice, but it'll mostly just taste of tomato. That's dinner.

The start of the season we had Sturridge which was half of strike force last year with Balotelli and Sterling. As a trio all are very quick and at the bare minimum Sterling and Sturridge will press heavy.

With Suarez and Sturridge both missing our whole identity and style of play had to be changed and that's during the season. We wouldn't have known how Sturridge's injuries would play out.

I'm not downplaying Suarez' contribution to the team, obviously he added a tremendous amount but having Sturridge in the team meant we wouldn't have to play a different style based on our opponents because we would have a great striker up front.

They aren't taking student debt into account when applying for mortgages, and your student loans will not stop you from getting a mortgage.

What they are doing is taking your repayments into account as they are committed outgoings, and are a guaranteed reduction on your disposable income each month. The outstanding debt is not the issue but the amount you pay can and does have an impact on the overall affordability assessment.

&gt; People always talk about reducing red tape for companies but student debt is red tape for people as they have to continually inform the company of changes in circumstances or be faced with fines.

It's generally taken care of via the tax system - the repayments are deducted at source by your employer and then paid to HMRC, who remit the total sum to the SLC once per year and then you receive your statement.

Second. Poor families don't pay much tax. Arguably, the tax they pay is all used up paying for other government services.

i am talking about the commercial success of white artists over black artists, white artists and white organisations have historically benefited unfairly from black innovations and the black artists responsible for those innovations have gone unnoticed and uncompensated. and, as i demonstrated with iggy azalea's fancy track, this still happens on some level!

this is a well accepted fact of music history and a well accepted fact of the music industry. white artists acknowledge it, Eminem has acknowledged it, ""if i was black I would have sold half"", Macklemore has acknowledged it, www.billboard.com/articles/news/6422361/macklemore-race-hip-hop-cultural-appropriation-hot-97

i did not blame two white rappers, you fucking idiot. i pointed them out as symptomatic of the problem. is that too difficult for you to understand?

i'm using white examples, do you want me to list the black artists who have also said the same thing? Q Tip has spoke in lots of detail on the subject, so has Killer Mike, so has Azealia Banks, so has Mos Def, so has David Banner.

the reason I'm struggling to find the energy to make this argument is that you seem to be entirely opposed to it. you keep making weird straw man and ad hominen attacks, accusing me of ""abhorrent bigotry"" ??? 

show me one place where i have suggested that white artists shouldn't interact with black artists? show me one thing I've said that is racist?

i am saying: it is important we acknowledge institutional unfairness that exists as a result of the history of the music industry. as i said, this is not a contentious point, academically or in contemporary discourse.

With the opening of the WEDINOS testing service it's trivial to identify those mislabelling things and the responsible vendors have done well as a result of this.

I agree that LSD and the like are typically safer, but the risks of *carefully* consumed legal compounds are low still, and the lack of legal risk makes the risk/benefit balance tip happily in their favour.

Some illegal compounds are actually more dangerous than their novel counterparts. MDMA is metabolised to create a metabolite which damages serotonin neurons and as a result reduces verbal memory and can cause anxiety and depression in some users. The APB series does not do this and appears to have a similar or better acute safety margin. Cocaine is another one, the sodium channel blocking properties are really bad news and are just a byproduct of the anaesthetic effect - mephedrone doesn't have this at all and as a result is much, much easier on the heart.  
Then there are the low hanging fruit, nitrous, salvia, poppers. All remarkably safe as drugs go.

The only *whole class* where there is no good news is the synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists. Cannabis is *so* safe that they really can't compare, even when they are quite benign.

I agree that random people making random substances are bad but generally that's not the case. Developing a new product is quite expensive, so a remarkable amount of thought goes into the development, typically by trained chemists or pharmacologists. The exception is where labs glean compounds from old patents and medical literature, but these again were developed by learned people.

Those buying on the highstreet don't care but those purchasing online, and therefore usually not on a whim, tend to shun compounds which do or may have negative side effects - there are a few obscure compounds which stayed that way after educated users pointed out they were likely to be dangerous.

 The contracts have not been exchanged. Bids have been accepted, draft contracts have been made, but we still don't have the actual contracts exchanged because the solicitors are not chasing searches, muddling up paperwork, and generally just not working on our case, it seems. 

It's not like it's extra searches that we suddenly decided on, it's just the standard things that should've been handled, well, weeks and weeks ago. Though admittedly, between us, the buyer and the seller there have been an awful amount of extra searches and costs that the solicitor insisted on that we never needed the first time we moved house. Like an extra damp-check on the house we are selling because there was ""damp everywhere"", only for the second search to come back as ""there's absolutely no damp whatsoever"". 

All I want is for the solicitors to stop dragging their heels and get all the paperwork done. That is what I am paying them for. But almost five months later, they are saying they need another 8 weeks to finish up. As I stated at the end of the post, I just want to know if there's anything that can be done either by other individuals or ourselves to speed the process up. 7 months is way too long for a moving chain this short. 

And I'd like to know if there's a way we can reduce the amount we have to pay them for their shoddy work.

dr dre didn't make the majority his money as a performer, he made it in business, Beats By Dre etc.

diddy made his money in business, seperate from performance. Ciroc Vodka etc.

Jay Z is also a business-man, he made most of his money through brands, rocafella etc. Same with russell simmons (also rocafella), 50 Cent, vitamin water and street king. master p was the president of no limits records, so he's not a 'performer' in the traditional sense either.

that list is not an appropriate response as it does not examine 'rappers' as performers, but simply rich people with backgrounds in rap. it doesn't contradict what I've said.

Wales is the odd one out in that it's the only one with a Transferred Matters model rather then a Reserved Matters model, so it has a list of things that it's allowed to legislate rather then a list of things it isn't allowed to legislate. It also has no devolved legal system so it comes under a combined legal jurisdiction of ""England and Wales"", with some laws applying to Wales only and some applying to England only. But even then the Human Rights Act is embedded into the ""constitution"" of the Welsh Assembly, so even though it's not explicitly devolved it's likely they'll have to ask the Welsh Assembly [for permission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Consent_Motion), which they probably won't grant.

On that note, if the Wales Bill goes though relatively soon then in a couple of years Wales will have a Reserved Matters model like Scotland and N. Ireland, and the Assembly will probably be increased in size and renamed the ""Welsh Parliament"" and such.

There is a significant cost associated with that policy and the money ultimately comes out of the block grant that is given to Scotland every year.

It's an expensive policy and in order to make ends meet the SNP have had to cut college places for kids, slash the funding available for grants for the poorest and shift the burden of student living costs onto the student loans system.

Sure it sounds nice - free tuition - but it's a regressive policy that predominantly benefits the middle classes whose parents can afford to fund their living costs, knowing that they won't have any fees or student loans to pay.

Without immigration or other changes the population of the UK will eventually start falling like Japan's has since 2004. We had a fertility rate of only 1.63 in 2001, well below the long term replacement rate of 2; since immigration increased in the 00's we've managed to bring the fertility rate back up to about 1.9 fairly close to replacement rates. 

1974 was the last year when the UK had a greater than replacement rate fertility rate so, barring any giant medical advances, in about 30-50 years we should expect the population, absent immigration, to start declining as the high birth era generation begins to die off in large numbers.

There is a risk the many more OECD countries could suffer the fate of Japan if they do not attract sufficient young immigrants.

null,false,Username_taken1981,null,null,null,"I'm just in the process of purchasing a new build property via the Help to Buy scheme.  It works for me.

Property value - £145,500
Help to Buy- 20% £29,100
Me -5% £7,275
Mortgage value minus 25% deposit- 110,125 (plus the £999 mortgage fee added). 
Monthly repayment £404 for 5 yr fixed rate mortgage. 

At the end of the 5 yrs, I will start to repay the help to buy at £43 a month added to my mortgage. Also will need to factor in the change in mortgage rate as will be the end of my 5yr fixed rate. The mortgage broker ran all these numbers and gave me examples before I agreed to anything. 

I would suggest speaking to a mortgage advisor (London &amp;amp; Country or the Mortgage Bureau both offer free advice) and checking your affordability/ numbers as I did above and go from there. 

The help to buy scheme works for me but like with anything there are pros and cons- definitely read up on what these are-eg repayment terms as it's not free money, you do have to pay it back.

I spent a long time debating help to buy vs continuing to save, and went for it, and am really happy with my decision.

TL:DR, speak to an independent mortgage advisor and run the numbers. Read up on the help to buy schemes and also discuss this with said mortgage advisor. If it works for you, go for it, if it doesn't, don't.

EDIT: feel free to inbox me if you want any more info about the process etc 

EDIT 2: just reread and wanted to add - the help to buy scheme doesn't ""go against you"" with the lenders. All they  see is that I'm putting in a 25% deposit, even though 20% of that is coming from the government. They will ask you to complete an affordability document though to check that you can afford the repayments both now and in the future. The poorer rates come from you how much of a risk you are - pull your credit report and do what you can before you're ready to purchase to improve your score- be on the electoral roll, manage your credit (i.e. pay off credit cards in full each month). Also some debt won't be a big deal - i have a car on finance at £200 a month and they haven't batted an eyelid at that.

As the article describes, it was used to emphasize the romantic rather than sexual component of homosexuality. Whilst I understand your argument, it is incorrect to say that '-philia' or '-phile' necessarily implies paraphilia. The suffix is ubiquitous in the sciences, and is used as part of the name of many hobbies and affinities; bibliophilia, Anglophilia, etc.

So, that's my pure semantic argument.

As far as paedophilia being an sexual orientation is concerned, for some people I don't think it is necessarily inappropriate to describe it as such, and in fact in terms of minimizing harm, it is probably beneficial to describe it and think of it as such. People have more or less gotten to terms with the fact that sexual orientation isn't chosen, is blameless, and cannot be changed. Certainly paedophilic acts cause harm where acts of most other common orientations don't, but paedophilia needs to be medicalized if it is to be approached with a view to harm reduction rather than violent and vindictive rage.",null,0,null,1433094662,null,0,false,0,crqzqzi,null,t3_37xvdg,null,t1_crqzqzi,null,t1_crqpu56,null,null,null,1433500356,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

Assuming I've got water on tap, and access to the usual array of cooking facilities (and that I don't have to conserve power):

* Asda SmartPrice Mixed Veg: 77p

* ASDA SmartPrice Chopped Tomatoes in Tomato Juice: 34p

* Asda SmartPrice Red Kidney Beans in Water: 30p

* ASDA Scottish Porridge Oats: 65p

* ASDA Smartprice Pasta Shapes: 35p

* ASDA Smartprice Milk Chocolate Bar: 30p (Surprisingly nice.)

There'd be 6p left over for a bag. 

* Make the porridge with water, melt the chocolate in. Breakfast x 4.

* The veg, nuked, is fine on it's own for lunch. Wouldn't wanna do it long term, but four days would be fine. Add some chilli for a bit of a kick. 

* Straight pasta with tomato puree and herbs (and maybe a bit of chilli) covers a couple of evening meals. 

* Veg + Tomatoes + Beans + Pasta + Chilli would do your other two evening meals.

I love tomatoes and I find a bit of chilli makes everything more interesting. You could cut the herbs and get another thing of chocolate if you wanted.

Pre-soaking the pasta saves energy if you're on a meter. 

If you're going to be on a tight budget for a while, invest in more herbs and spices. Strong or interesting flavours. Stock cubes. Some ketchup. Garlic, ginger, salt, sugar, cumin. 

Buy in bulk when it's cheaper, think more medium term. Use ""buy three for £1"" etc if there's a significant saving. If you've got access to a freezer and a microwave, consider preparing and cooking in bulk and freezing stuff. It'll help add variety.

It seems people are very quick to tell us how difficult things would be yet this is hardly uncharted waters, countries have split before and there's plenty of examples of countries that have done perfectly well post separation.

Think Ireland but with oil to help things along.  

I appreciate your belief that this is a Scottish issue though, there's an alarmingly imperialist attitude amongst some that seems to project the idea that Scotland is some sort of possession and that only does further damage to an already strained union.

I accept though that economic arguments don't sway me particularly, I'd happily be paying higher taxes in Scotland to support the current level of government spending etc.  I just feel England and Scotland are drifting further apart politically and having lived in a couple of small independent nations I would love to have the chance to pursue a path on our own that doesn't necessarily coincide with the path England, Wales &amp; NI wish to follow.

I disagree with nearly everything the government are doing and I cant see them reversing direction on any of it. 

I'm talking about 

* Foreign policy
* Tax policy
* Education policy
* Surveillance policy and civil liberties
* Health policy
* Welfare policy
* Defence policy 

This is why I wanted independence. I cannot see any attempt to fix any of this. Labour would have carried on the same policies and a large proportion of voters are either oblivious or badly informed about all of it. Even poor people are persuaded of the austerity agenda. For example.

***
British foreign policy completely sucks. (Iraq, Libya, Syria, Israel, Africa, America, etc etc) . Nearly everything we do is awful. We're complicit in the chaos in the middle east with weapons being funnelled through Turkey into Syria and refugees flooding out of the region, causing further immigration problems throughout Europe. All of this is to help Israel become the dominant super power in the region.

***
Tax policy, Enormous levels of tax evasion are ignored. Promises of reform swept under the carpet as soon as the polls closed. Non-doms in all levels of the establishment, tory party members and donors (including Lord Ashcroft) who are making millions and not paying any tax. Nearly all companies in the FTSE 100 are using dodgy tax avoiding strategies that didn't exist when I was a kid. 
***

Education should be free and should be our highest priority. We should copy countries like Finland, Sweden, Germany, Japan.

Child care should be excellent and free. Young people should be encouraged to have families and we should spend money on supporting them.

***
Excellent sheltered accommodation should be available for the elderly. But we cannot afford the ever expanding elderly population to have things as good as they do at the moment. Current BuyToLet policy is pushing up rents and house prices beyond the reach of the young and giving the old people an unfair advantage at the expense of the young. The tory prioritisation of the elderly over the young is without doubt a most short-sighted policy. But it wins them votes.

I could go on. 

Basically, The focus of tory policy is about stripping the state support for ordinary people with the objective of making the upper classes rich. The money doesn't trickle down, in fact it often leaves the country. 

We squander 46billion a year on defence while our neighbours Denmark spends less than 2 billion and Ireland spend less that 1 billion. If there's a war with Russia (our only conceivable enemy) then We'll get nuked and Ireland will be left in peace. We cannot afford to waste more than 10billion on aircraft carriers. 100 billion on Trident is just making us a target.

With your initial £3k, the 0.25%/year fee at Charles Stanley Direct or Cavendish Online amounts to £7.50, which would only cover a single trade on iWeb. Although of course, that £7.50 is every year compared to only a one-off for the per-trade fees, so it depends on exactly what you expect to do in the future... but even at a net saving it *would* take quite a while to cover the cost of that £200 up front.

It is also possible to do all the 'trading' with a broker where there are no per-trade fees, then transfer your accumulated investments to iWeb to benefit from the lack of ongoing fees, but for small total sums it would require some care to not accidentally get stung by too many of those £5 fees.",null,0,null,1433096539,null,0,1433097416,0,crr0rg9,null,t3_37zabg,null,t1_crr0rg9,null,t3_37zabg,null,null,null,1433500833,null,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

There are significantly more 'poor' families than there are traditionally 'rich' families. (as in the 99% vs the 1% rhetoric)

Those from lower income households or disadvantaged backgrounds have the most to gain from a university education, and given there are far more of them with the chance to go, they should be encouraged and assisted as much as possible.

Past a certain age, children tend to prioritize their social groups over their parents influence. This actually makes a lot of sense - their priorities and their parents priorities are different. It's part of growing up.

Parents get to be scapegoats for a lot of things that are caused by much wider culture. What are the odds that the only racist adults with influence over children are parents?

&gt;__Imagination__, also called the faculty of __imagining__, is the ability to form new images and sensations in the [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind) that are not perceived through [senses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senses) such as sight, hearing, or other senses. Imagination helps make knowledge applicable in solving problems and is fundamental to integrating experience and the [learning process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_process).     A basic training for imagination is listening to [storytelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling) ([narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative)),   in which the exactness of the chosen words is the fundamental factor to ""evoke worlds"".  It is a whole cycle of image formation or any sensation which may be described as ""hidden"" as it takes place without anyone else's knowledge. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] A person may imagine according to his mood, it may be good or bad depending on the situation. Some people imagine in a state of tension or gloominess in order to calm themselves. It is accepted as the innate ability and [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_process) of inventing partial or complete personal realms within the mind from elements derived from sense [perceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception) of the shared world. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] The term is technically used in [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology) for the process of reviving in the mind, percepts of objects formerly given in sense perception. Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language), some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as ""[imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/imaging)"" or ""[imagery](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/imagery)"" or to speak of it as ""reproductive"" as opposed to ""productive"" or ""constructive"" imagination. Imagined images are seen with the ""[mind's eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%27s_eye)"".

It's not Qataris, it's the migrant workers from South Asia who are suffering, but to address your point, actually it's debatable whether any extra deaths have been caused by the world cup construction. 

The stats used for the sensational headlines of ""1000 workers dead"" actually apply to workers across the whole country, even non-construction workers, and include deaths from natural causes, so they are not necessarily workplace deaths.

From The Guardian, regarding the data for Indian workers:

&gt; [Since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in December 2010, there have been 717 recorded Indian deaths. However, the Indian embassy did not provide further details on who those individuals were, their cause of death or where they worked.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/18/qatar-world-cup-india-migrant-worker-deaths)

Out of a population of 1.2 million working age adults, statistically you would expect a few hundred to die each and that is not unusual. Even the Indian Embassy says the same: [""Considering the large size of our community, the number of deaths is quite normal,” the embassy said in a statement issued on Thursday.](http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/indian-embassy-in-qatar-says-most-indian-deaths-due-to-natural-causes/article5713681.ece)

[If we look at the adult mortality rate for Nepal](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.AMRT.MA) for comparison. This is currently 187/1000. This applies to men aged 15 - 60, so dividing between 45 years gives us an annual average rate of just over 4 deaths per year per 1000. 

There are around 300,000 Nepali workers in Qatar, so on this basis we would expect around 1200 deaths a year for Nepalis alone. In practice the rate is much lower - only 185 per year.

I was saying synthetic drugs *should* need approval because they are inherently dangerous, even if there is later proved to be no danger, at the point where it remains unknown it must be assumed that it is dangerous and the onus is on the producer to prove that. I'm talking about consumer protection. 

The initial production of the chemical may be safe in some cases, I have no doubt the synthetic alcohol from Paull Nutt would be safe. I have no doubt that trained pharmacologists are involved to make it. But the people making it have often simply tried to synthesise a chemical found in literature, and manufacturing is certainly not up to standard. There are limited quality controls, and it's not unheard for recipes to be changed in order to contravene bans in market countries. Until something is proven safe, it must be assumed to be unsafe under the precautionary principle.

Online reviews have also been faked in other markets, though I'm not sure what they've been like with legal highs. Not that it really matters when the recipe changes, and it leaves the initial buyers of the substances in a vulnerable position.

My concern is entirely based in consumer protection, I don't care what people put in their bodies. I care that there is adequate, peer reviewed research, in any chemical intended to be consumed by people. ""Proper"" drugs have been properly tested with years of peer reviewed research behind them, undergone sufficient human testing, all so that their precise effects are catalogued. It's one thing to take properly produced MDMA because you can find out precisely what you're going to get. It's also unfair at this point to discuss mephedrone in comparison to MDMA because it has since been classed under the Misuse of Drugs Act, it is no longer a legal high and MDMA is entirely synthetic in the first place.

If we're going to let people do this, we might as well just let pharmaceutical companies bypass all industry standards alongside the Medicines Act and label their goods ""not for human consumption.""

I still live closer to where I was born than I do to for example Manchester, it's almost ridiculous if you really think about it. So many people think immigrants are horrible and should stay where they were born, but I'm closer to (what used to be) home than a lot of British people who moved half across the country. This is now my home, I worked my entire childhood to get here, to become ridiculously good at my job and be able to work for a wonderful company in such a beautiful country. (my job doesn't even exist where I'm from) I wonder what happened to this place. Maybe I just got older and opened my eyes, maybe it really did change over the past few years. Maybe it's not just Britain but a big part of the world changing. I don't know what it is, but I'm planning on staying. I want to help fix whatever is going on right now. I really do wish I was allowed to vote and be involved in politics. I pay more tax than many British people, I volunteer and donate to charities, I'm fully integrated, I pay for my own medical care rather than using the NHS, I do whatever I can to help out, but I'm not allowed to help make decisions about the place I call home. With how things are going I don't expect any changes soon, but part of me wishes they would change the voting system to include everyone who pays tax. Or everyone who has paid tax for 5 years for example. It all makes me a bit sad, but I'd rather fight for a place I love (even if it's going trough a hard time right now) than live somewhere I don't care about. Things are bad now, but if we all give up they won't get better and nothing guarantees that if we leave, the country we move to won't go trough the same thing a few years from now. It may be naive, but I keep hoping my generation will do better.

Your tautology may or may not be correct - to my eye, it looks meaningless, but by all means please explain it in greater detail - but it's also irrelevant.

Don't overthink this.  The BBC's argument (an argument I'd agree with) was: when the British public looks at a police box, what do they think/see?  The answer is, a TARDIS, which is a major component of a BBC intellectual property called ""Doctor Who"".  Accordingly, the court agreed that they should possess the trademark on the image.  All that means is that you cannot reproduce a police box or an image of a police box without compensating the BBC, or without their permission, absent certain explicit exceptions (in the United States, for example, parody is an acceptable purpose; I don't know British trademark law).

Specific police boxes aren't the issue.  When Microsoft trademarked the Windows name and logo, do you think that means all windows that were installed without Microsoft's permission were illegal?  Of course not.  And at any rate, police boxes aren't used anymore, they don't exist on British streets.

To quote my other comment - We play a lot more with less breaks than other leagues, plus the increased physicality and the varied style of football - as opposed to, for example the Serie A where you'll find tactically shrewd teams - a lot more defensive sides. La Liga where you'll see teams playing very fast, high press, few-touch football. It's incredibly less reliant on physicality in defenders. 

Further to this, the Premier league has 5-6 teams competing for a top 4 spot each year, add to this many people like Mourinho saying that the PL is harder to win than other leagues - plus at the bottom end of the table you really have no idea who's going to win on the day, upset results are a lot more common than La Liga - and finally newly promoted teams are usually straight back down, they find it incredibly tough to stay in.

But we can't have that now, and we won't for a long time. Until then, we have products that are, in all likeliness, demonstrably safer than their illegal counterparts. Just like how vaping is not *safe*, but is much healthier than tobacco, we have a similar situation here.

I think you are considering black market and grey market drugs (research chemicals/RCs) the wrong way around. RCs are typically produced in ""licenced"" labs (as good as it gets in china) to a remarkably high standard. If you look at the results on WEDINOS with a trained eye you can pick out that products from the reputable suppliers are really good quality, and rarely not what they purport to be. They are sold in large batches so that you do indeed know what you are getting. (Not the case if you are buying unlabelled blends of course, perhaps that is the sort of product you have in mind?)

Illegal drugs are the complete other side of the coin, produced in clandestine labs with NO quality control. That's if they are even what they say they are, because street drugs are very, very regularly adulterated, produced in small batches so things change all the time etc.

And as an aside, there is typically very little shilling in these markets - products tend to be picked up by multiple vendors at once so you're either shilling everyone's product, or you're obviously advertising one vendor.

I'm not suggesting that, though.  And nor, I hope, are the Destigmatise Sunday people.

What I would say is that the phrase ""Suicide Sunday"" suggests that committing suicide is a normal response to exam stress, which absolutely does trivialise suicide; and furthermore that some people who have had loved ones commit or attempt suicide probably would prefer not to be reminded of it by language which can be seen to trivialise suicide. 

 Some of the comments on the Destigmatise Sunday facebook group would support the idea that people *do* see it as trivialising suicide, and that people whose loved ones have attempted or committed suicide *would* like not to be reminded of it by this kind of language.

Whether or not it *should* be seen as trivialising suicide is I think largely irrelevant in this context: it is seen as doing so, and therefore we should treat it as if it does.

For your car needs speak to Marcin or Tony at AMK Autos who are just down a wee snick off the west end of the main street, by the carpet shop. Good lads, who just bought out Bryce's not that long ago and won't overcharge you. Marcin's a drift racer and they really know their stuff.

The pubs are okay with their fair share of roasters; not really my thing but the Railway Inn got bought out a few years ago and is now CAMRA certified. It's still a 'Celtic' pub but is less rabid about teams than the Mason's. The West End Hotel reopened a few weeks ago after several years of being closed but I've not been in yet.

Roast the meat on a bed of roughly-chopped base vegetables - onions, carrots, celery, maybe a bit of fennel. Bay leaves, whole garlic cloves and and sprigs of rosemary are very welcome additions.

Once the meat is cooked, remove it and leave it to rest, covered, in a warm place. It'll stay warm enough to serve while you prepare the gravy.

If it's been cooked on the bone - e.g. a rib of beef, leg of lamb, or a whole bird - there's probably enough liquid from the roasting to prepare the gravy. Otherwise, supplement it with some stock you've made from a previous roast (which you do have in your freezer, I hope? BTW, nothing beats roast wood-pigeon for making stock.)

Boil it up with the veg still in it, theb strain into a second pan (mash the veg thoroughly against the strainer to extract as much juice and flavour as possible). Return to a simmer and, if necessary, thicken with cornflour (put cornflour in a small cup or jug, then add a little cold water and mix thoroughly, before introducing it to the simmering liquid and giving it a thorough stir).

Bonus tip: [Laver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laver_(seaweed\)) is a superb extra ingredient for richness of flavour. Most supermarkets sell sheets of nori for making sushi, which is made from the same stuff - just chop some up finely and add to the liquid at the 'boil with veg still in it' stage.

And finally: don't you dare let the bones from the roast go to waste!

I've never made bisto gravy in my entire life, I've had it a few times - really not a fan whereas I adore home made.

I don't think home made gravy is that much trouble - usually when I do a roast I make loads and freeze it for later or in stews. Besides that I'll make an onion gravy - whilst it takes 10 minutes or so usually I'll be in the kitchen anyway and doing one more thing doesn't really make any difference.

Take this season, we were 1-0 up against Besiktas. They are by no means a bad team, but when we have won the first leg, we should be comfortable in the second leg with a half decent performance. Our performance was absolute shit that game. Just this season, say you? Well, let's take us back to 2 years ago then. 

Our group was Anzhi, Udinese and Young boys. Sure, we topped the group, but we only went through because of goal difference. I remember fucking drawing to YOUNG BOYS at home. Next round what happens? We were shit in the first leg against Zenit, then even though we were great in the next leg (I'll never forget that Suarez free kick), we still got knocked out because of how bad we were in the first leg. 

Still not satisfied? Let's take it back another 2 years, when we were in the Europa League that year. I don't even remember how we topped this group because I remember us only getting 2 wins our of 6. We were dreadful. Then in the Ro16 we play Braga. We put in a terrible performance at home (I still remember this performance because it was Kenny's first European game in charge) and ended up losing out. 

What happened at the end of the 2010/11 season? We finished in a position where we had no European football. What happened at the end of the 2012/13 season? We had no European football for next season. Granted we still had half the season without Europa League, we were not convincing in it.

I dislike the Europa League, because we don't put in the performances that are required to win it. I think it's a trophy that we should absolutely gun for, but we don't take it as seriously as the premier league because we see Top 4 as priority for CL.

Barcelona in 2012 were one of the best teams of all time and better than they are now (their forwards are better now but their midfield was so good then, it's nowhere near as good now), the same is true of Bayern. Chelsea beat both. So yes, I think it is relevant. Mourinho is a better tactician than Guardiola and Enrique are and better than Di Matteo was. With him at the helm Chelsea are going to be a threat. The Chelsea from the beginning of this season wasn't second tier, only Barca, Bayern and Real looked as good. 

You're right that improvements need to be made but you're looking in the wrong place. Costa is a world class striker, he doesn't need a replacement he needs a back up. Benteke would be a good back up. The places which actually need improvement are all further back and tend to primarily be about depth and options. Chelsea's primary starting XI needs little work or improvement, something probably needs to happen with the three players behind Costa and there needs to be an addition in midfield for big matches but that all derives from the real problem which is that the current starting XI is inflexible. Aside from younger players to act as long-term replacements for older ones, Mourinho needs the players which can allow him to exercise his tactical muscles. He needs a midfielder who can sit in alongside Matic as well as replace him if injured for instance. None of this involves signing a world class striker who wouldn't play and wouldn't improve the team unless Costa was injured.

Well, Jonathan Northcroft confirmed earlier that the club are unsure about Rodgers' future and are looking at Klopp. That was then further confirmed by Andy Hunter as his understanding too. Whilst neither said ""FSG are not happy with Rodgers"" the fact that they're open to another manager, and looking at Klopp, tells me they're not completely happy with Rodgers. 

&gt; No. That's stupid. 

It's not that stupid as owners usually do release statements of support in times like this. They haven't. As I've said before, that doesn't necessarily mean that Rodgers is gone, but I find it strange that there has been no public backing of him from either Henry as an individual or FSG as a company when it's quite obvious that fans aren't happy with the results the team are getting. 

&gt; there's zero evidence

See, that's where we differ -- I think both of the things I've outlined provide evidence that FSG are actively considering whether Rodgers is the best man for the job. Maybe they'll come to the conclusion that he is, but that they're looking at alternatives means they're not entirely happy as of right now.

2) Finland. Has more mint privelages than other nations, which does not show up as a reciept. Some great deals from Finland from when they first joined are still in legislature, they're happy to pay more to stop anyone from complaining.

Then Germany, France and Italy, whose payments prop up their banking systems after the crash. They're bailing out their banks using EU funds and pretending the financial sector is fine. One of Merkel's greatest achievements is to pretend the Greek bailouts were for the good of the EU and not to improve the German financial sector. People think Putin is a good politician - he's a joke compared to Merkel. The French are even more hilariously placed. Not only is their financial sector being propped up, but their absurd fiscal policy has crippled their growth (again). So now they're getting more contributions than ever - their net transfer has gone down by about 25% in 3 years. Moral Hazard, meet the EU.

Then the UK. Who got no support in the financial sector and has no monetary support. Austria and Sweden, punished for sensible post-2008 policies with higher contribution requirements (again, moral hazard). And the Netherlands who, similar to Denmark, play by the rules to their great detriment - at least they reap the monetary rewards.",null,0,null,1433107643,null,0,false,0,crr6otd,null,t3_37yxzj,null,t1_crr6otd,null,t1_crr4pke,null,null,null,1433503696,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null
