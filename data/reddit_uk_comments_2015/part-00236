2. I disagree with this. All are natural No. 10's. Willian was a No. 10 at Shakhtar and he's played as a winger for us for only 2 seasons. Coutinho and Oscar have played out wide at points for Liverpool and us respectively, could easily do so if asked, and would both be better than Willian. When it comes to being a winger and what that entails, both of them have a level of flair and creativity that Willian can't match, both are superior passers and dribblers to Willian, and they both have better end product than Willian. Oscar in particular is a big threat off of free kicks. Willian's only advantage over these two guys is pace, and it's not that big a gap, not enough to offset the other areas where he's worse than them.

I'm not trying to come off like I'm some anti-Willian guy who's trying to bash him into the ground.

Unfortunately, the age-old BlackBerry problem of poor app availability killed it - QNX only really found fame in the Ford vehicle in car systems, and was rebranded as BlackBerry 10 for their new range of handsets.

null,false,strolls,null,null,null,"Writing as someone else whose goal was also to go to university, and who dropped out, I don't believe that university itself is a goal.

I think you're maybe just like me, in that you feel you ""should"" go to university to make your life better, because going to university is something that everyone tells you you should do.

You probably think ""I'll go to university and get a good job and earn lots of money"", but the further steps of this route are more and more hazy in the distance (they probably don't feel very real to you) and I think such intangibility makes targets more difficult to achieve.

Maybe this speaks to my personality, but that's probably true of everyone else writing here, too.

In the last 10 or 15 years university graduation has become less and less a guaranteed strategy - now the only thing that's certain is that you're gonna end up with big debts.

Whereas IBM and HSBC run graduate training schemes, and want 21 year old graduates who ""fit"" with that kind of training programme and progression, it used to be that mature graduates were attractive to smaller companies, who appreciated wisdom or other kinds of work experience. 

Now, half the population is leaving school and going straight to university, and there are loads of high quality graduates who aren't able to get jobs in their field. The job market is very difficult at the moment, and I don't think that the replies you're getting ""just take an access course"" are recognising this. 

You don't need qualifications to earn money - people make good money fixing PCs, doing web-design or hosting, and selling avatars in Second Life.

My gut instinct is that you should self-study and become the best Python programmer or Linux admin you can be, whilst finding little ways to make money. 

If you're finding self-study difficult, however, then I think taking a couple of GCSEs at your local college might well be a good place to start. I don't believe this is expensive, and you might find a subject that really resonates with you - perhaps you'll really get into geography or history, and decide to pursue that at a higher level. 

From my own experience, I think ""what should I do? I know! I'll go to university!"" is a bad idea. IMO you're far better being in the situation where your advancement feels natural and progressive.

null,false,mercut1o,null,null,null,"I think people are really missing the right perspective on this potential loan deal. 

Mou knows a club like Chelsea needs 3 strikers. Ideally, they'd all be world class but look at Cech: no world class player wants to sit on the bench. So one world class player to start, no problem, and that leaves two spots. 

The second spot is still desirable. Chelsea will compete for several competitions. Second choice is probably guaranteed verbally a certain number of starts as well as champions league minutes, and the players know injuries are frequent. Second choice likely gets a run in the league too. This spot is obviously undesirable for a proven striker in their prime, but for a capable youngster like Remy it's a manageable place psychologically. It's desirable. 

Who do you put in the third spot?

Mourinho has answered this question brilliantly. First with Eto'o, then Drogba, and now Falcao he is signing mentor type veterans who know they've lost a step but still want to compete at the highest level. Imagine the positive impact a Drogba or Falcao has on the dressing room, especially when those legends are grateful to be there. 

Sure, Mourinho could fill the spot with another young player in more direct competition for the second spot, but he would risk that player becoming jaded. Especially because eventually that player might become no better than second choice. It's much safer for team harmony to bring in a big name with a professional and winning attitude. It makes sense in terms of shirt sales, mentoring younger players, nerves in cup competitions, and super subs for the end of the match when that missing step is much less important than guile.

Now imagine how freeing it is to be a striker with a focused competitive mindset for years and then have a manager you would dream of playing under offer you a role where scoring isn't your first and only job. We trust that you'll score some goals. It's guaranteed. You're great at it. You've been doing it all your life.

&gt; **Alex Gibney's Scientology documentary Going Clear is to get a UK release despite legal pressure from the Church of Scientology on film companies not to allow screenings in their cinemas.**
&gt; 
&gt; Screen Daily reports that UK lawyers acting for the church have contacted at least one company which is involved in the release of Going Clear and warned of potential copyright infringement, should the film be screened in the UK.
&gt; 
&gt; However, distributors and exhibitors will go ahead with their plans to show the film in 10 to 15 UK cinemas from June 26.
&gt; 
&gt; Screen Daily also says marketing plans for the film have been changed because of the controversy surrounding the release.
&gt; 
&gt; Sky Atlantic, which owns theatrical rights to the film, has reportedly postponed the film’s UK television broadcast until September, after concerns that the film could contravene libel laws in Northern Ireland.
&gt; 
&gt; In Going Clear, the Oscar-winning Gibney, whose previous films include Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God, interviews former members of the Church of Scientology and reveals alleged abuses and `strange practices' within the organisation.
&gt; 
&gt; The Church of Scientology has denounced the film as “bigoted propaganda” by former members whom it calls “misfits”.
&gt; 
&gt; In a previous statement prior to the film’s television broadcast, the organisation said: “The Church of Scientology will be entitled to seek the protection of both UK and Irish libel laws in the event that any false or defamatory content in this film is broadcast within these jurisdictions.”
&gt; 
&gt; Going Clear won acclaim at the Sundance Film Festival and was shown on US TV last on HBO. It was watched by more than 5.5m viewers, becoming the network’s biggest documentary premiere in ten years.

&gt;

&gt;The __New Forest__ is an area of southern England which includes one of the largest remaining tracts of unenclosed [pasture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasture) land, [heathland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heath_(habitat\)) and forest in the heavily populated [south east of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_England).  It covers south-west [Hampshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampshire) and extends into south-east [Wiltshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiltshire) and towards east [Dorset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorset).

&gt;The name also refers to the New Forest [National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_parks_of_England_and_Wales) which has similar boundaries. Additionally the [New Forest local government district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Forest_(district\)) is a subdivision of Hampshire which covers most of the forest and some nearby areas, although it is no longer the planning authority for the National Park itself.

&gt;There are many villages dotted around the area, and several small towns in the forest and around its edges.

On the one side some jobs wouldn't work with shorter hours, a broker for instance. A broker is going to want to be in work when the market is open, which means being in work for at least 42.5 hours. On top of that they're going to need prep time &amp; pre market meetings so they'll need to come in earlier. Plus people should be able to choose for themselves how much work they want to do. No one should be telling them, you need to work at max X hours per week! 

On the other side working such long hours is unhealthy &amp; not good for our society (in my opinion). In some ways I also think people shouldn't be penalised by not being able to get certain jobs if they don't want to work excessive hours.

On balance I'm probably OK with the way we deal with it right now. I would like for us to move towards working less hours though. More people working part time, and government schemes to incentivize that if people want to work that way.

null,false,fairysdad,null,null,null,"Recipe is simple.

* Eggs, depending on how much batter you want, either about 2 or 3. Crack them into a measuring jug, mix them up.
* Add milk to the same volume as the eggs, so if the eggs take up 100ml in the jug, add another 100ml of milk. Mix.
* Add plain flour to the same volume, so your final mix is 300ml. This is a bit tricky, you may want to add smaller amounts and mix, and if it's too little, add a bit more.

I've usually then put the batter in the fridge, occasionally overnight if I'm that prepared for cooking. Then, during the cooking:

* You'll want to use a not small pan - I used to use [cake trays](http://i01.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/1327730871/New-Tasty-Fill-Round-Cake-Baking-Pan-Tin-Set-Non-Stick-Sugarcraft-Decorating-Cake-Baking-Tools.jpg) for my Yorkshires, but found that they were too small, so I've recently used a couple of [glass casserole dish lids](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NkYkHCxXL._SY300_.jpg) instead to make a couple of giant ones. (I've also been known to use a frying pan with the handle taken off to make a huge one...)
* Whatever type of dish you use, put it in the oven set to the hottest temperature you can (usually around 220ºC).
* Once the dishes are hot, take them back out of the oven, and, again this is what I've recently been doing, put some butter on the dish to grease it up, brushing it all around the pan.
* Put a good amount of batter into the dish and pop it into the oven. Take anything else that is in the oven out if you're serving that bit up (usually for me it's the roast potatoes at this point).
* Leave them in the oven for around 10-15 minutes or so - again, I've tended to use this time to dish up the rest of the meal onto plates.
* When you take them out, they should be nice and risen and nice and brown.
* **Don't** open the oven while they're still rising - if you want to check to make sure they're okay, put them in an oven with a window.

In my view, you're prioritising the vanishingly small risk that the stock market will grow less than inflation over the next 35 years, over the very real risk that cash-based savings will do that.

Your perception of risk is skewed - because savings accounts don't do spectacular crashes, you see them as safe, when in fact you're just taking a different kind of risk. That's the risk of small underperformance for 35 years, leaving you losing money in real terms.

When a stock market crashes spectacularly, it tends to recover pretty quickly. For example, the recovery from everything going tits-up on the FTSE 100 in October 2007 took six years - not a long time in a working life. Being 28, you can absorb those crashes easily, and rebalance away from them as you get older.

In order to have an efficient free market, you need good information flow about the various products on offer.  (Indeed, the 'invisible hand' only appears where there is _perfect_ information availability, which is rarely the case).  Often elided from that is that the information needs to _also_ be understood.

This is where the difficulties with applying free markets ideas to education arise.  Education is one of the few things that is extremely difficulty to evaluate until it's been consumed [0] - and therefore that immediately places difficulty in the pre-purchase evaluation.

Certain aspects of any course can, of course, be described - how many hours of lectures; what the lectures will cover; how much lab work; what will be done in labs, etc.  However, the synergistic benefit of these can be difficult to convey.  For a particular stretch of my time at undergrad, the lectures improved my practical skills, whilst the lab work improved my theoretical understanding.   This, I submit, is the opposite way round from what would be expected; and that sort of effect places barriers to 'pre-purchase' evaluation.

Further than that, there's often things earlier in the course that only there for later aspects.  If someone only wants the later stuff, not the earlier, and doesn't see the connection between them, is that the fault of the prospective student (who has been told everything, but doesn't understand it), or the university?

Fundamentally, education is not a thing that one 'has', it is a process that transforms one.  This means that part of the thing that one has to have perfect information about is oneself.  I hope it's not considered contentious if I suggest that the vast majority of people applying for university do not know themselves even approximately well enough to have such perfect information.

I'm not sure that there is a simple solution to this - and whilst I generally like free markets, we need to be critically aware that the nature of education means that it can never meet the theoretical requirements for efficiency.

null,false,RedManStrat89,null,null,null,"I have to give them that I understand their reasoning too - in their desire to relieve Belfast of its current title as the most congested city in the UK (something not a lot of its residents even realise), they wanted to get those living on the outskirts of the city out of their cars.  Trams wouldn't have been for those people, and normal buses aren't nearly good enough to do that.

But to me if you look at the numbers, congestion is less about people on the outer ring and more about a) lack of trains for outsiders/commuters, b) people like me who live on the edge of the city centre using the car for trips across the city, which I shouldn't do and c) the fact that some shocking amount (like 35% or something) of city centre land is surface car parks.

The Troubles had two adverse effects on the cityscape here; when a building was lost the land-owners would rather not risk another one, hence the ton of car parks we still have, but what that's meant is Belfast is unique in being one of the few of the major cities in the UK not to fall victim to the architects of the '60s/'70s/'80s.  

What this has done then is meant we aren't really blighted (for the most part) with the utter dirt that was urban planning in the late 20th Century, and with every new development that goes up Belfast is re-finding its built culture.

I've been assigned to people as a support worker and found them destitute - a carer is coming round to help them with meals and hygiene, but they have no money for food because they were sent a letter they shouldn't have been, couldn't reply to it themselves and without family or friends it's the carer (who is on a 0 hour contract and has neither the time nor the knowledge) to help. they'll try to make a call about the letter but they can't sit there on hold for half an hour, or the next of their too-many clients goes hungry.

On Saturday I was wandering round Waitrose while visiting gf in York close to closing time. 

I saw that a lady was reducing food in the usual section and thought I would go and see if I could get a bargain. Normally I get a lot of reduced stuff from my local Tesco and it's all quite laid back with people sharing out stuff. Usual faces etc.

Out of the corner of my eye I noticed an old lady, who must have been walking slightly quicker than the rate of glacial erosion, speed into a shamble worthy of the Danse Macabre and *ram* her trolley across the aisle so that no one could get through and the poor assistant was reduced having to lean over to put the food on. She then passed the food - any reduced food, would do - to her husband waiting at a frankly Stakhanovite rate. There was almost nothing left for anyone else. A group of us watched in frank admiration.

I smiled and apologised to the poor shop assistant to imply that while I enjoyed a good burrow in the reduced section, I would not quite demean myself that much, but probably just came across as weird. I then got 6 fancy sausages reduced to 79p from £3.39.

Leaving the car park the same lady was loading all her reduced food into a Range Rover.",null,0,null,1434967949,null,0,false,0,csemlgw,null,t3_3ap1me,null,t1_csemlgw,null,t3_3ap1me,null,null,null,1437252273,null,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20,null

Another reason he's not worth more than £9m:
- Spurs have no use for him, esp as he costs us big ££ in wages every week. 
- But few clubs would want to pay up much at all for him.

Most people recognise that Liverpool lacks World class players, and I don't think you'll see that this transfer window. I think they're gonna focus on rebuilding a strong team of good but not great players that will get them consistent results and hopefully for them land them in the top 5. 

It seems like Liverpool still have almost all their spending money after a few free/cheap transfers.

As a Basel fan, when we went up against you in the CL, I was honestly not really ""scared"" of anyone on your team, except maybe Sterling. There has to be a player that scares the opponent, and others that make the task seem harder. If you go up against Arsenal for example, you immediately think ""fuck you're gonna have Sanchez on one side, Ozil, Ramsey, Cazorla, around""

I think Clyne would be a good signing. He's not the best RB in the world, but he's a big upgrade from what you have now. 

A central midfielder that inspired confidence. Henderson and Milner is not a very menacing or exciting midfield. Someone like Sigurdsson would be in my opinion quite good and reasonable.

It's not just the fee, it's also the wages: He's probably on £75,000-£80,000 a week, so around £4 million per year, for the next two seasons. That is a big saving that can be reinvested in new players or in wage bumps for the likes of Harry Kane and Bentaleb.

Also, £9 million isn't a huge loss -- Spurs only paid £13 million up front for Bobby, the rest was add-ons. Safe to say his performances didn't trigger too many additional payments. 

Just a £4 million loss on an unproductive, over-30 striker is as good a deal as you are ever going to get, sadly.

Valencia have claimed it was the full £26m, though:

http://www.totaltottenham.com/news/transfer-news/spurs-land-roberto-soldado/
""Valencia president Amadeo Salvo stood firm on Soldado’s €30m release clause, ruling out any deal with variables or add-ons.

“Roberto is a very important player for the future of Valencia and our project here. That’s why we stand firm on the player’s contractual terms. If he was to leave it will only happen if the release clause is met.

”If the player wants to leave someone will have to pay the fee stated in his release clause. If that happens we will not block his departure,” said Valencia president Salvo.

Despite Valencia’s difficult financial situation, the La Liga outfit stood firm on their valuation of Soldado. Spurs opened the negotiations by tabling a €26m plus add-ons bid, but eventually agreed to pay the price stated in Soldado’s release clause. Once the fee was agreed both clubs continued negotiations regarding the structure of the payments.""

Growing up I always played team sports (still do) which are great but they are all about being better than someone else whereas Martial arts are about being better than the previous version of you. It really made me think about what I was at and I realised I was just drifting through life wasting whatever potential I had.  
 
BJJ (brazillian jujitsu) taught me my ego had been calling the shots for my whole life and my ego was a lazy bastard with no work ethic. It made me want to get up in the morning and go to the gym to get better, get stronger, get more flexible, improve my diet etc. It became a vehicle for me to improve my life which started seeping into other aspects of my life and now I'm self employed, eat healthily compared to junk foods before, meditate and do yoga everyday and am in the beast shape of my life both physically and mentally.

Even then, the infrastructure 'investments' are often dubious. What were they thinking when they signed off the Millennium Dome or the 2012 Olympic games park.

Osborne's hard deficit rule is cack-handed though and needlessly rigid. He'd do better to hypothecate particular departments to tax revenue (as was historically the case); link NHS spending to a rolling average of 110% of NI receipts, Transport to fuel duty and VED etc., then have a constant backlog of ready-to-rock infrastructure projects in the pipeline at all times (dry powder if you will) that can be 'deployed' with emergency deficit spending when private spending slacks.",null,0,null,1434969718,null,0,1434969995,0,csemzic,null,t3_3am04s,null,t1_csemzic,null,t3_3am04s,null,null,null,1437252472,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Also, their choice of parts is well done and there are no tradeoffs (on sites like Dell's you frequently find that part X has a choice but parts Y or Z, which depend on X to an extent, don't, so the setup as a whole ends up being suboptimal).

If you don't want to make choices the default values are the cheapest options; although you will end up with a reasonable system it would be better to go for one of their pre-built options.

Main parts:
&gt;The fee you pay provides a wide range of TV, radio and online content, as well as developing new ways to deliver it to you. In addition to funding BBC programmes and services, a proportion of the licence fee contributes to the costs of rolling out broadband to the UK population and funding Welsh Language TV channel S4C and local TV channels. This was agreed with the government as part of the 2010 licence fee settlement.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Although the money is raised for its own use, the BBC does not directly use the collected fees. The money received is first paid into the Government's Consolidated Fund. It is subsequently included in the 'vote' for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport in that year's Appropriation Act, and passed back to the BBC for the running of the BBC's own services (free from commercial advertisements).

null,false,syntax,cnty-scotland,Stravaigin,null,"&gt;  The current system--where we fund everything, even those skills which are already in abundance--is massively inefficient.

It is if you believe that the point of University is to teach skills.

Given that it is not, I would submit that your evaluation criteria might be, at least to some degree, misplaced.

They would be better criteria for Further Education - but that's not what a degree is.  (Yet again we may lament the destruction of the polytechnics).

&gt; You can get a pretty good sense of NPV from graduate stats on employment/earnings/etc.

Not totally - how far ahead _should_ one look?  1 year? 5 years? 20 years?

Consider the discipline of computer science - given that it has had a meteoric rise (in comparison with other, more mature, disciples).  Depending on what time frame you consider, you can arise at vastly different conclusions about the CS department in different universities, as you retrospectively apply such analysis over time.

Certainly it is _a_ measure; but, like any other simple and objective measure of Universities, it is clearly only looking at part of the picture.

Part of the benefit of an education, rather than training, is to prepare one for things that are _not_ foreseen, and that are not understood - yet.  This is why universities are places that do both Research and Teaching - that aspect of the education sits very closely to what is practiced on the research side.

Assuming that all graduates will follow the same course as was trod before is to wilfully ignore that aspect.  Granted, many (most?) graduates won't break new ground in dramatic ways; but the ability to do things _beyond_ what one was trained to do is a skill that is both valuable and unpredictable.

I'll close by noting that the higher degrees are even stronger examples of these issues.  Indeed, if purely financial return was the sole criteria, then no-one should ever do a PhD - doing will reduce you're net total earnings over your lifetime, on average.   That alone should demonstrate that there are other factors afoot.

EDIT: Forgot to say:

&gt; I just think there are some market-based reforms that could do a lot of good

I mostly agree, but we need to be careful they don't optimise for 5 years ahead, at the expense of 20 years ahead; and long term effects are tricky for free markets; and for members of our species - particularly the younger ones (pure as a consequence of less experience - thinking ahead longer than ones own current time on the planet is difficult for all of us, older people have only one trick that can help; namely being here longer…)",null,0,null,1434970577,null,0,1434970809,0,csen6oz,null,t3_3aostb,null,t1_csen6oz,null,t1_csem091,null,null,null,1437252606,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

I wouldn't have minded paying the fees, especially as I got paid in my third year placement. I didn't choose this course because of that, I actually wanted to do Audiology before I found out about the funding, and I wear hearing aids anyway.

The point is, they've now changed it to a horrendous plan. Three years over £9k (for most universities), which is just like other courses. However, the final year is a placement year where they attend university for 4 days and have a couple hours of one-to-one support with their dissertation. They then get no funding to help them while doing their placement.

So the course went from me being paid about £14k to work in an Audiology department, to the students paying £9k to work in an Audiology department essentially.

They have to fund travel and accommodation themselves. Most of the students in the current course at the uni I went to have weekend jobs. So they're working 6/7 days a week, and have to do a bunch of work too. One student I know of wakes up at 5 o'clock and doesn't get home until about half 6 in the evening.

There's a reason that Liverpool and other PL teams look at players in the PL; traditionally there is a high chance that players from other leagues have struggled in the Premier League.

Just saying that there is a foreign equivalent is still a gamble and there is less of a guarantee than somebody who is, for want of a better term, Premier League proven.

That's why Liverpool and others look within their league first. Does this come with a price premium? At times yes, but it's a calculated risk; do you spend £15 million on a foreign player, with 50/50 chance it doesn't work out and you have to write them off, or £20 million for a 80/20 chance?

&gt; Universities UK said the last national student survey found 86% of students were satisfied with their course.

I suspect that the real reason for the 24% gap there is because they have very little idea of how much it actually costs to run a degree scheme to the standards we do in the UK. The face to face contact time for a course is only a small part of the overall costs associated with the degree scheme - there's a huge amount of behind the scenes work that students generally have no idea about *and* there's a huge amount of extra facilities provided to students (all being driven by the need to be ""competitive in the market"").

The other side of this, and the reason that making degrees be market driven, is that the value of a course is created in no small part by the student taking it no matter what you do. Our top graduates this year are going on to do fully funded PhD's, work for international companies, start their own businesses, etc. and I don't know any of them that would say the degree wasn't worth it for them. There's nothing stopping other people reaching the same level but they haven't because they haven't worked as hard on the course. 

How do you measure the value of that? You can argue that people who aren't getting the full value shouldn't attend University but if that's the case then you shouldn't set up a scheme that incentives universities to recruit as many people as possible regardless of how beneficial it is to those individuals.

The police investigated and it transpired that the child had taken a bar of chocolate from the shop and hidden it in their clothes. The mum gave the child a single slap on the hand and made them return the chocolate bar to the shop. The police had to record this as an assault by the mum on the child and shoplifting by the child.

It looks like one big cluster-fuck with the Government and Union failing to resolve the issue together. The Government changed the law to force the issue on the Union, but instead of doing anything about it the Union have spent the last four years campaigning for an exemption (which the independent body has rejected).

Ultimately, who wasted all those millions on over-seas recruitment? The Government, or the NHS?

The crux of the issue seems to be that we need more funding for nursing places, but then surely that’s determined by the government?

Even if it weren't the case that students were now contributing more to their university costs, academics are under constant pressure to ensure their programmes remain attractive to students. Fewer students means less funding, smaller academic groups and, potentially, dissolution of degree programmes altogether. So it's absolutely imperative that academics ensure their programmes are as good as can be, and this is reflected in league tables and in [KIS data](https://unistats.direct.gov.uk/find-out-more/key-information-set) which feeds back to potential students.

And all of that is ignoring those lecturers who simply do actually want to do a good job regardless.

Students do expect more for what they pay, but their demands are certainly not always realistic. Many do appear entitled and view their degree as a product they have bought and should be tailored to their interests and work ethic, rather than the other way around.  For some students, whatever we provide is simply not good enough (and, listening to their complaints, would be impossible to provide).

null,false,the_ultravixens,null,null,null,"So, she quotes the figure of 27 million dwellings and 150,000 build last year, which is an increase of 0.5%.  For the last 10 years or so population growth has been running at around 0.8%.  There's also issues of *where* all those houses are. There are parts of liverpool and the north east where there are loads of empty houses just rotting away, simply because nobody seems to want to live there.  So there's really more of a lack of supply in areas where people also want to live.  And frankly she would do well to remember that houses are *depreciating assets*, and naturally over time should decrease in value as they age.  The increase in value of these assets is indicative of supply shortage.

I don't know whether that is sufficient to explain the *insane* increase in [average house](http://monevator.monevator.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/real-house-prices.jpg) price since about 2000.  I would suspect not.  I think there are broader economic factors driving money into housing, such as the lack of decent savings vehicles available in this country and the relative lack of government debt for people to use as a safe asset, so we just stick all our money into housing and boost the price, which is an entirely unproductive segment of the economy.  This has probably helped encourage the foreign investment boom which she's writing about, in a rather irritating positive feedback loop.

I'm a bit dubious of this claim, although things may be different amongst those younger than me.

I have to admit that I am surprised by the reactions here that characterise this kind of teenage violence as extraordinary. 

I went to an expensive [public school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_school_\(United_Kingdom\)) and was bullied and involved in fights more than once. In the 80's the attitude of most staff there was *boys will be boys* and they didn't act upon anything they didn't see.

The staff were far more concerned about complaints about our behaviour in town - ""walking three abreast down the high street"" - than they were about bullying and victimisation.

I can't speak for everyone, but my experience was much as described by /u/Ivashkin and I'd have assumed that was widespread - maybe I'm wrong, I'd be surprised to meet a bloke over 40 that hadn't been in a fistfight or received at least a minor kicking as a teenager.

Bacca is also 29 in a few months, if we buy him for £21.5m he most likely wont have a decent resale value whatsoever. Plus to tempt him away from Sevilla who you could argue are in a better place than us right now we would probably have to offer pretty high wages.

I do. However, foot patrols are the most inefficient method of policing. It is a complete waste of police resources that has absolutely no effect on crime levels.

Have you ever been down south and seen the amazing job they do, with patrols. The amount of time i have seen them chase someone.

Yes it might be inefficient to have police on the ground. But your not exactly staff starved. There are many many people that work for the police literally pushing paper all day now because its safer and less chance of claiming injuries.

If you can see from my quote I said in certain circumstances.
So it is not my viewpoint at all, I was just saying that sometimes it isn't an issue. 
My viewpoint is far more complex than that but I am unlikely to ever be an employer so who cares what I think tbh.

Not all, a majority or even a lot but I said in certain circumstances. Eg sometimes, basically is what I meant.
I do totally agree that many companies do just put as a minimum you require a 2.1 and any further info like uni quality that you went too will be looked at by them but the first step is the 2.1. 
This is why I didn't push the company grad schemes I worked for because I am more than aware they list these as a requirement and many of the similar jobs too. A 2.1 is a clear advantage but OP and the world knows that so tried not to harp on about it too much, flogging a dead horse and isn't too helpful to him individually.

I was just saying , as you did, not all companies are like that and if you can find the ones that don't, or at least are a bit more open to it eg you have a 2.2 but its from a good uni that is worth more than a 2.1 from elsewhere you may boost your chances.

What I'd suggest (after spending many days using a push mower to cut down tall grass) is don't let it drive itself if it can, just push it over slowly so it has plenty of time to chuck the cut grass out of the back.

Also, if you can avoid it don't use the box - these constantly jam and are a real pain in my experience. If you have a dismountable back box with a flap to protect your legs then just let the grass come out of the back - it'll help fertilise the lawn as well.

You do not know what a weasel word is. ""A weasel word (also, anonymous authority) is an informal term forwords and phrases aimed at creating an impression that a specific and/or meaningful statement has been made, when only a vague or ambiguous claim has been communicated...""

Nothing this guy said comes under that description.

&gt; I think I made my point clearly and concisely, so...

Well you didn't. In fact, judging by your interpretation of that guy's statement, you don't even recognise a clear point when it's made! The point you were attempting to make was that he was trying by choice words to obfuscate his true feeling which was that he feels that the Iraq war was a mistake.

When it's in fact very clear that all he's saying is ON THE BASIS of hunting for WMD; ON THE BASIS of Labour being popular, it was a mistake. But on various other bases, first amongst those, the moral imperative to free people living under a tyrant - who are you exactly to have determined his view on that?

&gt; calling me a hypocrite for attacking his motivations (or at least, that's what I think you're saying in the massive straw man wall of text) doesn't hold water.

Only if you deny the accusations - which you notably haven't. So I think actually it does hold water. Especially now you've gone on to do exactly what I described before in claiming,

&gt; The motivations for doing it are difficult to ascertain, but nobody with half a clue about the world can say it was an overwhelming sense of justice and duty to remove a brutal dictator.

Both Blair and Bush are on record multiple times explaining their personal moral rationale for invading Iraq, as well as the wider strategic reasons why allowing a despot with a history of destabilising/invading his neighbours to remain in power was a bad idea. You, have decided either to ignore that, or you never actually knew, but post anyway. I don't know which is worse.

Ask whether it is the 'Takahli' caste which is the one i'm from, much like the regional difference between Brits the caste system between these groups in Nepal and predominantly South Asia are highly distinguishable much more in Nepal due to the wide ethnic diversity of the Indo-Aryan and Monogoloid blood. Each of them have their own idiosyncratic rituals in relation to religion and culture, often having different values from one and another. This often transpires to the behaviour of the certain individuals of the group, which often leads to what career paths these groups often take. 

The caste my parents are from but whom I don't associate with due to my cultural upbringing in Europe are known collectively as Takahlis which is a caste within 4 groups of families. The anthropological origins of my genetic heritage and the caste I was born into were from the mountainous areas of Northern Nepal, based in the proximity of Salt mines which were in high demand which lead them to engage in some business. Hundreds of years late they ofcourse set their identity with business leading to shape their behaviour etc... You get the jist, pretty much the universal concept of all groups of people that our history shapes our cultural therefore decidedly our behaviour.

In this case, i'm guessing the room mate is suggesting that there are certain castes who solely specialise but not to a extensional degree in having most of their families entail on to a military career which i can confirm this is true with certain caste, which they often have an advantage when the selection process occurs as they have caste members as high ranked members and partake on the recruitment process.

&gt;

&gt;The __2014–15 Macedonian First League__ was the 23rd season of the [Macedonian First Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_First_Football_League), the highest [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) league of [Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Macedonia). It began on 2 August 2014 and ended on 27 May 2015.

&gt;That season was featured 10 teams instead of 12 because the [Football Federation of Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Federation_of_Macedonia) voted to decrease the size of the league in May 2013.

Browne was a president of the Royal Academy of Engineers. There is no such thing as the Royal Society of Engineers, it's just the Royal Society, an organisation Browne is only a fellow in (like a lot of other pre-eminent scientists and engineers). 

The fracking report was a join report by the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering. Both bodies are widely respected by the scientific and engineering world for their impartiality and trustworthiness.  

The fracking report outlined a number of recommendations for regulations on onshore fracking. These have most been implemented, many regulations already applied due to existing legislation and oversight by current bodies. People seem to ignore the fact we've been fracking in the North Sea for decades, there's a hell of a lot of regulations that are still enforced on land. 

Edit: I'd also be interested to see if you've even read the report. Browne left the Royal Academy in July 2011, almost a year before the report was released, eight months before the report was even commissioned in March 2012. So Browne had absolutely jack shit to do with either society during the entire report. If you're going to slander somebody at least get the dates right.

Chances are you probably said they lend out people's deposited money to other people in the form of secured loans and mortgages. You wouldn't be the only one.

New money is created when banks create a loan, and is destroyed when it is repaid. Roughly 97% of new money is made by banks, the government only creates about 3%. That 3% is all the physical currency we see, the rest is just a bunch of numbers on a screen - digital IOUs, if you will.

As such, if the BoE wanted to, it could suddenly create a lot more money - of course, this would increase inflation slightly, but then again our debts in sterling would then become more valuable (to us) yet at the same time worth *less* to the creditor. So running a deficit is actually beneficial, as the government can stimulate the economy by embarking on big public works schemes that benefit national infrastructure, by employing public service workers who can then spend and consume thus aiding the economy, by reducing the value of its national debts.

In the same building you can have some that are top 20 in the country for satisfaction, employability and international kudos, then others that are failing and being propped up by the successful ones. They don't end the failing courses because money is money and that's what it has become now - a giant gravy train with no shortage of people willing to get into a life changing debt for a piece of paper and a pointy hat. Job prospects? In a country now full of Batchelor Degree holders you now have to start looking at Masters and the  PHd's to gain the edge, so more debt and more time being behind your peers when it comes to employability even with such qualifications.`

Don't get me wrong, some courses are very worthwhile but I would say the majority in my experience are simply cash cows, printing degrees up and raking in the money. For example look at the failure rates for these courses, in some instances there are places that haven't had a failure for over 10 years. They get pushed over the line to tick boxes but that's a huge red flag for me, quality control is gone because retakes and re-sitting modules costs so much and at a time when most academic staff bugger off for 3 months. The external examiners seem in on the ruse and also don't seem to fail even the most dismal course work. The treasury are now saying that Universities need to be more involved in the employability of students and guess what? If they do, they get to increase fees to essentially whatever they like (proposed plan). What the mechanism for this is I don't know but it would seem like just another way to make more money and to somehow reduce the risk on defaulters - which is a growing problem every year.

The other issue I have seen is rampant validation of umpteen courses based on the same tiny amount of resources. It seems no one is told that the 50 PC's they have in the IT suite already has to cater for 1000 students and adding another 300 students on a new course is just making it worse for everyone. Then there is study space, face to face tutor time - all these things are ticked but no one appears to be asking is this dedicated to a course because in my experience there is a non stop stream of courses coming online and almost no investment in facilities or staff to accommodate it. Another reason I advise most people to skip the whole thing and get some proper training on the job in their chosen vocation, as they may well decide they hate it given time in whatever sector and they've just got into a £40k debt for nothing having gone to University. Or to at least leave it until they are more sure about what they want to do.

1) Lack of social housing stock - we can thank Maggie for that one. Also the ban on building any more has inhibited the natural supply-demand keeping rent low.

2) Increasing population, mainly due to immigration (but without immigrants we'd have a declining population, be overly top-heavy with too many old British people, so actually they're helping)

3)
-a An obsession of owning property: it seems to be most people's dream. The European approach is; if you want to live somewhere, you'll probably have to rent, unless it's a longtime family home or you build it yourself. We live on a small island. We need to shake off this idea that everyone can own a plot of land. Also the obsession with thinking rising house prices are good- yeah sure, if you are selling up and cashing out. If you're moving house, guess what? All the other houses you were looking at moving to have also shot up in value. Well done, clever you. Also - prevent younger people getting on the ladder, and who's gonna buy your old property?

-b Our older generations are still occupying big houses that they no longer need or can make full use of. They often see it as their castle/retirement fund, so are reluctant to move out. Tough luck, we have a housing shortage. Foreign citizens holding multiple properties, and people with second houses are also part of the problem, but more locally nuanced rather than nationally (ie. rural hamlets and quaint seaside villages). We should cap the amount of property one person can have.

4) The green belt. yes it's lovely - but it's preserving a past Britain that most people only drive through every once in a while. Allow sustainable, local development, in keeping with the environs.

5) Big building firms - not building enough new houses (keeps the price artificially high), and the ones that are provided, like Barratt shoeboxes, no one would  want to live in if they had more than a suitcase of belongings, or was worried about walking through a Japanese paper thin wall.

6) Housing benefit/Student maintenance/Buy to let schemes: the only reason student properties are booming, is that private landlords know they can milk students (through government money) for all they're worth. Housing benefit also props up private rent costs - and that in turn puts pressure on the market, so normal workers need pay more too. Government guaranteed deposit schemes simply artificially prop up

That is being rectified with further training for lecturers - for instance in my university a condition of continued employment is the completion of a course in Teaching &amp; Learning in Higher Education; looking across the board, in lecturing job adverts in UK universities some form of qualification in teaching, or evidence of good teaching practice (such as Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy) is increasingly being required. 

Your point on exam questions is a brilliant one and actually positive criticism compared to your statement earlier. Yes, setting questions to examine understanding rather than rote learning is good, but it's not easy to do. I totally agree with you; I had set an exam essay question which was rightfully criticised by a student with exactly your point - the reason I had set the question like that was because I was inexperienced, I wanted students to do well etc... I took that criticism on board and adjusted my questions accordingly. But you ought to be aware, as a student, that the exam-learning mindset is cramming, and therefore *student* perceptions of learning expectation also needs to change. Lecturers are partially responsible for that, of course, but students are adults and must take responsibility themselves.

Universities are increasingly introspective; the best universities are competing for students, and are aware that poor student feedback will not help. Programmes are examined by external examiners, and for those that have any kind of accreditation then certain standards are required of the courses. Attitudes to teaching and ability to teach throughout all university teachers/lecturers isn't going to change overnight.

Recycling programs to benefit the public. Ie return bottles / containers for discounts on products. This used to be a thing. If you bought 6x bottles of beer, they would have a small additional charge for the bottles, if you return the bottles, you get a discount. The people on benefits would be out picking up litter for actual money in their pocket.

How does this benefit the public - a multitude of ways.
How does this benefit the big business - it doesnt.

There are many examples of things like this, many ways we can empower Joe Public to line his own pockets and improve the community. But if Joe Public gets empowered, he might start having ideas above his station.

Long term unemployed people - why not give them a little allotment, no charge (as long as they are unemployed) for a place to grow their own food. Healthier happier (just as poor) people, but this takes money out the pocket of big businesses. Therefore not even feasible.

The 20% cream is only licensed in the UK for acne vulgaris, the 15% gel is licensed for both acne and for rosacea. The 15% gel is the more modern formulation with a [better delivery system] (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/706166_2) so it is not 'weaker'. I can't see anything obvious online about which is more irritating.

Licensing happens *because drug companies apply for it* in respect of specific medical condition(s), then a panel of experts assesses the efficacy and safety evidence put forward by the manufacturer. It costs a lot of time and money to put together the evidence and make the application.

I would not mind betting Bayer - who make both products - did not apply to have the 20% licensed for rosacea because the 15% is twice the price of the 20% according to the [British National Formulary.] (https://www.evidence.nhs.uk/formulary/bnf/current/13-skin/136-acne-and-rosacea/1361-topical-preparations-for-acne/benzoyl-peroxide-and-azelaic-acid/azelaic-acid).

The cost per unit will influence prescribing decisions and thus Bayer's income - not only what they get paid per unit today but going forwards, they have a number of years after patenting a formulation where no generic alternative can be available. With acne there are multiple topical alternatives to azelaic acid, but with rosacea there are not so Bayer really have a corner of that market sewn up. Bayer would not want their own cheap 20% cream to compete with their own pricier 15% gel.

I have honestly never looked for any comparisons since the 20% cream is not licensed for my skin conditions. If you skim through the summary of the 2011 Cochrane review you should find studies on the 20%, possibly some comparing to the 15%, but most will be comparing to metronidazole or to the base gel/ cream without the active.

Yes it does. The question put to him was ""whether, in retrospect, he and Mr Blair regarded it as a mistake"". He did not answer that question. He said, as you so clearly put it:

&gt;When it's in fact very clear that all he's saying is ON THE BASIS of hunting for WMD; ON THE BASIS of Labour being popular, it was a mistake

Which is not the same thing as saying ""Yes, I think it was a mistake for these reasons"". It has the appearance of providing an answer, but does not. 

&gt;But on various other bases, first amongst those, the moral imperative to free people living under a tyrant - who are you exactly to have determined his view on that?

I have not and did not pretend to determine his view on that. I said ""one suspects"" and then made a sardonic comment. 

&gt;Only if you deny the accusations - which you notably haven't. So I think actually it does hold water.

I didn't think I'd have to issue a denial of those ""accusations"" given they are so obviously wrong. In fact I attributed to you a much better argument than you seem to have actually been making - I thought you were purposefully attributing me all sorts of silly views that you realised aren't mine in order to make a point about me attributing views to him which he purposefully avoided expressing and therefore I similarly can't know. My response to that is that given a direct question, he did not actually provide an answer but instead made an obfuscated, conditional response which did not express his views on the matter. I, on the other hand, was not asked a direct question and was making a simple point in a cynical manner.

&gt;Both Blair and Bush are on record multiple times explaining their personal moral rationale for invading Iraq, as well as the wider strategic reasons why allowing a despot with a history of destabilising/invading his neighbours to remain in power was a bad idea. You, have decided either to ignore that, or you never actually knew, but post anyway.

No, I have decided to doubt them. If we waged wars on the basis of morality, we'd have sorted out messes such as Zimbabwe or Eritrea, much easier targets with - especially in the case of the latter - horrendous records. No, we start wars on the same basis we always have: political, ideological or simply pragmatic.

&gt;But I do know what is worse than both: The abject cowardice required to be able to say with a straight face that because something is hard to do, or has a high cost in lives and/or resources - might as well not bother.

Again you are attributing things to me that I did not say. ",null,0,null,1434978393,null,0,1434979709,0,csepkz3,null,t3_3alfs9,null,t1_csepkz3,null,t1_cseony6,null,null,null,1437254401,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Effect can be used as a verb when it means to bring about a change, as in the signing of Mauricio Pochettino effected a new era for Spurs. He could also affect a new era, which would mean he would contribute to it/alter it. So his use in that sentence is correct, in that using the word effect there has a slightly different meaning than using the word affect in a similar sentence (directly brings about a change rather than contributing to it).

And affect can be used as a noun when describing an influence or a manner of speaking. So Mauricio Pochettino can both have a huge affect on Harry Kane's growth (influence) or a huge effect (cause-to-happen). So in his sentence, the word affect is being used as a noun.

I asked ESA for an update last Friday, as Debt Management is still sending me letters asking for the payment of the - as yet undecided - civil penalty. I also asked them for an update in May, and to tell Debt Management to stop sending me letters until ESA have done their decision making.

So I called on Friday afternoon and they said ""we will call you back within 3 working hours, so before 9.42 on Monday"".

I called them at 9.45 today, because they hadn't called me. Apparently the paperwork wasn't there and so they decided - without telling me - that they were intending to call me before 11 today, not 9.45.

They didn't see the point when I asked if I can just attend the jobseeker's appointments as and when I feel like it, without telling them, because when I promise to do something (making an appointment) I bloody have to keep it.

Anyway it turns out that ESA asked for paperwork from another department which missed the post on Friday and so... is arriving slowly. Post. In the 21st century.

But they're actually going to decide and post me the result before the end of this week, a whole 8 months since my ESA claim had started, and almost 5 since they decided to give me the civil penalty.

&gt;Is it different though? How many of these people actually act on these beliefs? Again, there are many in our society who hold morally questionable beleifs. But they are allowed to do so, and it is our job to convince them otherwise. 

I agree. Just because I am voicing some criticisms about Britain's Muslim community, doesn't mean I don't support efforts to address those problems. You won't see me doing that on Reddit because there aren't many Muslims here that are prone to radical Islam, not on this sub at least. And personally, I don't think I am qualified nor have the relevant background to educate Muslims against extremism. I will leave that task to the community itself and the government.

&gt;As part of a documentary series on this issue I've been interviewing experts in Extremism and terrorism. The root causes of extremism range from the politics of identity, religious ideology, foreign policy and economic deprivation. Each instance of radicalisation is individual with it's own unique set of circumstances. Ultimately our actions abroad have had a great deal to do with the rise of Political Islam. Pick up any history book and you'd begin to understand the long history of geopolitics, structural violence and corruption that have culminated in the situation we see today.

You seem well-informed on the matter, so I won't challenge you on what you've said. On some level, I agree with you, western geopolitics has played a strong role in exacerbating the spread of Islamic terrorism (mainly via the west propping up Saudi Arabia, and by extension, its Wahhabi interpretation of Islam, and then of course you have the Iraq war). Economic deprivation is also a strong factor, again, if we look at the Muslim community in America, it is much more affluent and educated than Britain's own community. But I think such criticisms can only go so far. Ultimately, the buck ends with Muslims. They make a conscious decision to join a terrorist organisation that rapes, enslaves, murders innocent civilians. You cannot claim you are standing against western imperialism, economic disenfranchisement, and all that rhetoric if you join Al-Qaeda or ISIS. That's the height of hypocrisy. These killers join because they are *genuinely* warped into the dangerous ideology of radical Islam, a strand of Islam that sadly does not receive much criticism from 'moderate' Islam.",null,0,null,1434978823,null,0,false,0,cseprah,null,t3_3alzlm,null,t1_cseprah,null,t1_csead64,null,null,null,1437254533,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Fact is that Gerrard's headlines (and kind of whimper of a career wind down sadly), Sterling's headlines (and that right cunt Aidy), and two losses in a row to teams we could reasonably lose to (Arsenal and United), all contributed to an intensity of media pressure that was not on any other club at any other point in this season.

Why? Because Liverpool fans get so easily riled and so many of those contributing to the clickbait were kneejerk fans who'd only come on the season before. The other fans were kneejerk old fans who only came back to the fold after the season before. 

All in all it contributed to a horrible nosedive at the end of the season. Yes, absolutely, there were embarrassing results in there. But if those results happened half way through the season we'd likely have forgotten about them. If we'd never gotten to a semi-final we wouldn't have lost to Villa, on and on.

Firstly, I'm one of these humanities students. I had five jobs in my first year. I was probably doing more hours than you while simultaneously trying to get an education. To do what, might you ask? I really want to become a teacher so I can make a difference. Maybe there's one or two teachers each person remembers as standing out. For me, the whole damn languages department at my school. But I guess people like me are just there for an easy ride, a piece of paper saying I'm educated, and looking for some drugs and friends to dick about with for a few years while I fritter away John and Janet Lunchbuckets' hard earned taxes.

While you were growing up in the real world, students are also growing up - but surrounding themselves with nutters and weirdos with different opinions. Exposed to all that, it really is a lot about finding yourself, but something you would only understand had you done it or something similar where people you would never normally associate with (and becoming ever more vocal and firm in their crazy beliefs) are forced to educate themselves in close proximity for several years.

It's a pain because if you don't have a clear view what (sort of) job or career you want prior to picking a degree you'll struggle, but very few 17/18 year olds have a career in mind.

I picked Physics because I always wanted to be an astronomer, but found myself too jaded after my MPhys to want to continue on to a PhD (as would be needed) so I hemmed and hawwed until I settled on a graduate role in technology transfer, which didn't use my physics knowledge to any great depth. I've now had a career change and work in radiation protection, where I'm using my physics background every day.

But you're absolutely right, people should only really go into physics if they're interested in something directly related to it. Most other careers have some form of applied course that would be better in most real-life roles (e.g. engineering and its many subdisciplines).

I've seen a few people mention Bio being a poor degree choice, and I'm not sure why - Biotech companies are springing up all over the place and it's [a big thing that the government are pushing on for](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/eight-great-technologies).

I feel like I'm reaching a sweet spot in terms of products that work for me and knowing what sorts of things to avoid. Four years of adult acne and the resulting trial and error have taught me a lot. 

Anyway, products: 

After successful patch testing I've started using the **SR Skincare 5% Salicylic Acid** toner. It's too soon to give a proper review, but it's an odd product - the stink is almost unbearable, and my skin tingles like crazy after application, so I was expecting dryness or flaking but no sign of any yet. Will be adding it to the BHA reviews once it's had a bit more time. 

And I've been prescribed **Skinoren** (20% azelaic acid) and am loving it! I expected it to be like every other prescription I've had - irritating, drying, unpleasant, a chore to use... but it's none of those things. I've been using it twice a day and my skin isn't irritated, no dryness (and less redness!), and it doesn't leave a weird film or stickiness or any of that. Fingers crossed that it actually helps get rid of my acne because if it does I'll be making sure I never stop using it. 

And before I forget: I have a holiday in the sun coming up and now that I've stocked up on sunscreen, I'm looking into topical antioxidants to make sure I'm as protected as I can be.

I don't think it is. Parliament's role in exercising oversight of the prerogatives also forms part of constitutional convention.

Agreed on that, mostly.

According to who? Inflation is mostly fiddled.

CPI is NOT an indication of inflation it is an indication of consumer behaviour. CPI is flawed because of hedonic adjustment and the basket change trick.

So for instance bread was £1 and goes up to £1.20. 

This inflation is masked in one of two ways:

It is substituted for rice which hasn't gone up in price = 0% inflation.

Or the nastier trick is they remove bread from the basket in January then put it back in February. This resets the price of bread from £1 to £1.20 in the basket. So even though it has gone up by 20% the inflation statistic says it has gone up by 0%.

Inflation is mostly hidden with inferior ingredients and or shrinkage. Remember horse meat? That was an inflation story as companies substituted ingredients for cheaper ones.

We have a shortage of them, and the government is trying to encourage people to go into these professions, but they are neither respected nor well treated. To add insult to injury, their courses cost just as much as wannabe doctors or engineers. We need both, but just because you can't place a value on their skill, doesn't mean you can pay less, charge more, and disrespect.

He was bought for £26 million on 1 August 2013 on a four-year contract, so annual amortisation was £6.5 million. If he is sold after two years, the cumulative amortisation will be £13 million, leaving a value of £13m in the books. 

The early reported sale price to Galatasaray is reported as £9 million, if this proves to be the final sale price Spurs will have to report a loss on the sale of £4 million in the 2015/16 accounts.

I hear you ask, well whatever price you sell him for - the club removes the £13m amortisation value from the books, plus his wages (€3m / £2.1m) so £15.1m - you subtract the loss from the deal (£4m) and somehow Spurs are still able to report a profit improvement of £11.1m overall.

The Daleks are war machines bred for nothing but hatred and evil, killing everything that does not conform to their ideas of right and wrong. In addition, they are the perfect contrast to the Doctor who is genuinely terrified of them. This episode, in my opinion, did this fantastically. Granted there were a few strange moments like Van Statten owning the internet and that weird torture scene where he finds out the Doctor has two hearts (honestly man, a stethoscope works just as well!). 

To an extent I agree with you, Van Statten is a bit of a caricature. However, that works in his favour as he is nothing more than an egotistical fool who would rather preserve his own collection rather than his staff despite numerous warnings. In a way this does make him very unsettling as he sends his own people to his death. This can also be applied to a lot of the staff too. For example, in that scene where the soldier says ""I think I can handle a tin can"" (or something along those lines) he completely underestimates a Dalek's capabilities much like the first time viewers. 

As for the exchange between the Doctor and the Dalek, I completely agree it was brilliant. The only thing I didn't like was Rose trying to be the better person by saying ""what does that make you? Look at this poor genocidal pepper pot!"". Otherwise, I thought it was a good episode before the Daleks sadly became less and less impressive as the seasons went on.

I'll clarify; our ability to ""print"" our own currency is not particularly meaningful if we're severely limited by the extent that we can exercise it, considering that our current government debt is something like 80% of our GDP. 

To make a small dent we have to create a lot of money, and making a lot of money may not necessarily cause an inflationary spiral but will still cause a lot of damage to those with savings in GBP, who will then be much more interested in investing in currencies without such a policy.

To add insult to injury, their courses cost just as much as wannabe doctors or engineers. We need both, but just because you can't place a value on their skill, doesn't mean you can pay less, charge more, and disrespect.
&gt; 

Nurses and teachers both earn more than the average/median UK salary. It a pretty solid salary, even if you don't progress up the career ladder. 

Nurses and teachers are both entitled to lots of grants and bursaries for taking their courses eg.  https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/bursaries-and-funding

Nurses will never be paid as much as doctors as they require no where near as much education as them and work under much less pressure. 

&gt;We've come as a society to appreciate professions that earn more money as better, than those that help or better society. Something's gone terribly wrong.

Try educating yourself and reaching a conclusion that way instead of just making things up to suit your world view. You've just made up that teachers and nurses aren't respected and then gone from there.

Oh really tell me why.

Because EVERYTHING a public sector employee spends originally came from theft from a private sector person.

Lets say you have 10 farmers with £100. ~ £1000 in total Lets tax them a tithe 10% so they pay £10 each. This £10 can now employ a public sectorist. Each of the farmers has £90 ~ £900 in total and the public sectorist has £100. So £1000 in total.

So how much money do we have? We have £1000. Except the public sectorist double counts and says we now have £1100 because my £100 is added on top of the production without considering where the production came from.

Now get rid of the public sectorist and all of those farmers now have £100 each. They would spend £100 each and the amount of spending stays exactly the same but the spending stays in their pocket rather than that of another person.

A public sectorist essentially pays no tax. The *tax* that they do pay is merely putting back into the pot which they did not help to fill.

Also during the Chinese warlord era my ancestors sold vegetables. There was NO government. Yet they were capable of running a private sector enterprise. I have a Libyan student.

&gt; Gerrard's headlines 

I'll give you that one. I do believe Gerrard went about his departure from Liverpool kind of the wrong way; I think he put tremendous pressure on himself, and the team, to perform strongly and get good results as a nostalgic send-off. Neither his, nor the team's, performances were that good, and each bad result further increased the pressure. 

&gt; two losses in a row to teams we could reasonably lose to 

You confused this issue yourself -- if we can reasonably lose to a team, why would it increase the pressure on Liverpool? It would be more detrimental to the spirit of the side if we lost to ""unreasonable"" teams. 

Aside from this, I do think that the United game was an important turning point in the season because we could *conceivably* beat them and probably should have, in my opinion. 

&gt; Liverpool fans get so easily riled up 

Astounding generalisation, not to mention the fact that you're really just describing football fans rather than any particular club. Just look at /r/soccer for proof of that. 

&gt;if those results had happened half way through the season we'd likely have forgotten 

Losing 6-1 to Stoke isn't something that would be forgotten, I assure you. Showing no emotion or drive in most games wouldn't be forgotten. It's not the results that bother me as much as the poor performances, and fans don't forget performances where it looks like none of the players can be bothered. 

&gt; because they're arseholes

Or just because they have a different opinion? Not all Liverpool fans unconditionally support the manager, especially when we're performing as poorly as we have been. Discussing that isn't an ""arsehole"" move to see him sacked, it's just expressing an opinion.

null,false,kopmadrid,lfc99,,null,"I have decided to compile a list of players that liverpool could realistically target. 
The list has players that, in my personal opinion, will improve the liverpool squad and give us a fighting chance for the top 4 and maybe a title challenge. 

*They are:* 

**Asmir Begovic** 
With his desire to join the top 6 clubs, Begovic makes a realistic goalkeeping target for liverpool. At £8 million, He would be a great coup for Liverpool and will provide competition for Mignolet. 

**Inigo Martinez** 
Liverpool's problem at the back still persists and Martinez could be a good addition to the backline. He will be a realistic target given Real Sociedad's lack of european football and could be tempted for a move to Liverpool. Still only 24, Martinez has a bright future ahead of him and would be perfect for FSG's transfer policy while also being a quick fix for liverpool. 

**Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang** 
With both Liverpool and Dortmund in the Europa League, He could be a tough but realistic transfer target.Because of his blistering speed, he would fit right into the fast-paced gameplay Brendan Rodgers prefers. He will be also be a counter threat. 

*The following are players that LFC are already linked with and will improve the team:* 

**Nathaniel Clyne** 
With Liverpool not having a proper right back, Clyne is the best option for LFC being a proven premier league RB. Liverpool have been heavily linked with Clyne and he looks to be Anfield-bound. 

**Mateo Kovacic** 
Another player heavily linked with Liverpool, Kovacic is young and has bags of potential and will be a great addition to the squad. He seems to be Anfield-Bound as well 

**Roberto Firmino** 
With both Man Utd and LFC fighting for his signature, this transfer can go either ways. But he would be a great replacement for Sterling and if rumors are to be believed, would cost only around £15 million. 

*Honourable Mention:* 

**Javier Hernandez** 
If Aubameyang cannot be acquired, Liverpool should turn to Chicharito. Although this transfer could be unlikely with him being a Man Utd player, it would be a great addition to the liverpool frontline. He is only 27 years old and knows how to find the back of the net. With first team opportunities limited at ManU, He poses as a realistic forward target and will be a good back for the ever-injured Sturridge.

Who says they are?  Most would be concerned about both, although there may be a dearth of information on one or other.

&gt;a number of anti-scientific environmentalist groups, the same groups that have ironically managed to hamper the use of nuclear power which is basically our only chance of not warming the planet by &gt;2C. 

I'm certainly not anti-scientific, although I accept there's definitely an anti-technology new age-y type demographic who also oppose fracking/nuclear.  They are fundamentally primitivists and I've no time for them.  On the other hand, the nuclear industry and the GMO industry have done great PR jobs which _do not_ mean they are the best solution in their particular cases, nor that they tell the truth about health risks, science, economics, patents, etc.  The manner in which nuclear has been greenwashed and GMO has become a crusading technology for alleviating world hunger and poverty are risible.

&gt;The most dangerous thing about fracking is frankly road accidents due to the increase in HGVs on small roads. 

It's a danger to go into the accounts, time will tell if it's the major or even a principle one.

The simple rule is your money halves in purchasing power every 10 years. If China hadn't ramped up for cheap white goods it would be severe.

&gt;and yet their price inflation is still something like 2% and their GDP figures are middling.

See this. Government says there is no inflation. I can clearly see inflation.

http://www.pastaqueen.com/halfofme/images/2008-03/creme_eggs.jpg

CPI is terribly flawed (intentionally) oh beef has gone up in price! Eat Chicken instead it is still meat! Chicken goes up in price offal! 

&gt;If you don't understand how the mondern monetary system works then you're going to make horrible mistakes like this, which will end up costing you money.

Of course I understand, the modern monetary system is an intentional obfuscation to separate the bank from the government who are both the same entity yet exist to perpetuate a separation of identity and therefore enable themselves to steal from individuals without it appearing as if they are stealing from individuals. It is almost *but* not quite perfect which is why they need to keep changing the rules. For instance oh RPI then RPIX then CPI in order to keep the masquerade going.

For example rather than take ££££ from bank accounts and pockets. They dilute it and steal purchasing power. Laymen see £10 in their pocket today and see £10 tomorrow and see no difference. Individuals blame greedy companies instead of the cause.

null,false,boardsandbikes,null,null,null,"I personally think the need for an out-and-out defensive midfielder differs from match to match.

Some very successful teams have played without true defensive midfielders recently (Juventus, Athletico Madrid, Real Madrid), by playing with deep-lying playmakers and runners either side of them (in the case of Juventus Marchisio, Pirlo, Vidal/Pogba, in Real Madrid Modric, Kroos, Isco) or by having multifunctional players with very strong defensive and offensive work rate/abilities (Raul Garcia, Koke, Mario Suarez at Athletico).

The main similarity between the two teams however is the strength of their defence. Essentially they can sacrifice maybe one midfielder, or have one midfielder less with defensive responsibilities because their defences are extremely strong one-on-one.

Liverpool's isn't.

As such, I think we need a true defensive midfielder against the top level sides, especially if they themselves play with a 3 man midfield. We saw against Arsenal and United how when we are overrun in midfield we basically hand the game to them.

There was an interesting post from another user regarding using James Milner as a deep-lying playmaker, which on balance is actually quite a smart idea; but as I said in that post I think this would work against lower ranked teams or teams that would park the bus. It would also allow a midfield of Milner, Can and Hendo to work well.

Against the top teams however, I'd play Lucas, Milner and Hendo for that extra security, and to make sure we aren't overrun and our defence exposed.

By the way, Song is savagely overrated and I would hate to have him at Liverpool. He didn't cut it at Arsenal because he wasn't focused enough on his defensive duties, he didn't cut it at Barca because he just wasn't good enough and he wasn't fantastic beyond Christmas for West Ham either.",null,0,null,1434984718,null,0,false,0,cseskct,null,t3_3akur8,null,t1_cseskct,null,t3_3akur8,null,null,null,1437256511,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

That's something I agree with and have seen in others. One of my old mates told me it wasn't worth his time to get a job that paid less than £25,000 a year as it would be taking a cut from what he ""earned"" on benefits, which I can't abide.

There's a lot to be said for employment being good for the soul but I worry that not everybody on benefits is in the category of those like my mate above.

So yes, I absolutely agree that benefits should not be an attractive alternative to employment.

It would either have to be a poor platform with high fees, bad timing on when the investment was made or just a poorly performing fund (or more than likely a combination of all three) to bring the annualised return down to 2.5%.

If a FTSE 100 index tracker had been used: 

Bad timing scenario: The 2009 high of the FTSE 100 was about 5322 near the start of December. The FTSE is currently at about 6810, which is a return of 28% (4.58% annualised). That said inflation over roughly the same time period (Dec 2009 to May 2015) is running at 13.8% which puts the real return of the FTSE 100 closer to 12.4% which over the 5.5 year time period produces a real annualised return of 2.15%.

Good timing scenario: If you take the FTSE 100 low of 2009 (in May), update the other figures and re-calculate the total return is as high as 93% (11.57% annualised). Inflation adjusted this is a real total return of 65.2% and a real annualised return of 8.73%.

People who talk about solutions that involve harming London are barking up the wrong tree. We are incredibly lucky to have London - it makes us relevant and wealthy where without it we probably wouldn't be. However, the fact London is a huge and prosperous place doesn't mean that Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield can't be successful in their own right. Solutions ought to be focused on those cities, and shouldn't really be talking about London at all. 

The other way to look at this is from the perspective of londons property crisis; any solution to property shortage and high prices in London that involves talking about building homes in Manchester is barking up the wrong tree. London and the SE needs more housing. Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield need more jobs, and critically they need better jobs.

The first cut was made by HR and simply based on which university, then grade, then the subject, then they would actually read the application and finally pass on about 5 per role to the ultimate person hiring. I would say 75% are not read beyond basic facts.

As a student at uni without a car it isn't very easy to do a lot of hiking sadly. But I've seen a couple of Meetup.com groups that revolve around hiking and that, you should check them out! Otherwise there are tons of other groups on Meetup, you'll be sure to find one that piques your interest. 

I spent a lot of the past year trying out new bars and restaurants (especially those mentioned in lists made by the blogs that I mentioned in my last post). For cocktails, I'd recommend The Lost &amp; Found, The Bureau and Gas Street Social (L&amp;F has a happy hour every day from 5 to 7 I think and Pitcher and Piano gives you one free cocktail or beer of their choice every month if you subscribe to their email newsletter). For beers, my favourite is Pure Bar. I find the flights of beer to be good value if you want to try one of their many beers (which you should - they have twenty something beers on tap). Some also enjoy The Wellington, Old Joint Stock or Post Office Vaults and they all have a wide selection but I don't really like the ambience personally. Now that it's the summer, definitely check out Lord Clifden in the Jewellery Quarter, it has a very relaxed beer garden with free table tennis, TVs and they also throw on the BBQ. Might as well pop in next door to The Church, they have soul food and cocktails as well, though I don't fancy their roof top as much as Clifden's. Apparently The Bureau also has a really nice roof top, but I haven't had the chance to visit it yet. I forgot what it's called, but there is another chain pub between Brindley Place and the NEC/Barclaycard Arena that has a wicked balcony and terrace that is perfect for people watching. 

Fridays I'd recommend trying out Digbeth Dining Club at least once. There's always a couple of street food vendors in the back courtyard that are worth checking out. If you go on the first Friday of every month then lots of places will be open in Digbeth with exhibitions and events (First Friday). I've only been once, but BCU organises something in the Edible Eastside venue with dirt cheap cocktails (£1 for a small cup of Raspberry Rosemary Gin - and students are notoriously heavy handed) and there's also something going on in The Bond Warehouse down the road (look on Facebook for their Summer Festival).

In terms of going out, I generally stick to venues like Amusement 13, Spotlight &amp; Next Door or Rainbow, but if you fancy chartsy music then Broad St, Snobs and Propaganda at the O2 Academy should sort you out. For concerts there's The Institute, O2 Academy, NIA, Genting Arena and Barclaycard Arena.

Clotheswise there are some cool shops in the Great Western Arcade, otherwise there's obviously the Bull Ring and a couple of shops in that area. The high street in Kings Heath is lined with great charity shops that are within walking distance from Moseley. Also, as others have mentioned, there's The Prince of Wales near you. Check out the many parks in your area as well, I believe Cannon Hill Park also has a botanical garden or something. If you're there for a while, check out the 50 Things to Eat in Birmingham list compiled by Independent Birmingham. A friend and I were hoping to finish the list by the time we leave uni. ;) 

That's all I can think of at the moment, wouldn't want to tell you too much, part of the adventure is finding these spots yourself! But if you get your hair cut, I can recommend Barber JQ in the Jewellery Quarter. :) I'd invite you out for a welcome drink, but sadly I left Birmingham a week ago and won't be back in until September 2016...",null,0,null,1434986727,null,0,false,0,csetoth,null,t3_3ahr8e,null,t1_csetoth,null,t1_cscwgk4,null,null,null,1437257236,null,2,false,brum,t5_2rdjk,2,null

Ah, so it's ok to ethnically cleanse somewhere so long as it's small. Gotcha. This *might* work as an excuse if it weren't for the rest of British history where we spent several hundred years doing just that. It's hardly a single isolated incident.

And, in case it passed you by, the people of Crimea have been consistently voting to break away from Ukraine for decades. So surely those ""millions"" actually serve as part-justification? I somehow doubt the Changos were voting to get what we did.

My worry is whether or not the Benteke rumor is this year's version of the Bony rumor or more like Balotelli...where we end up signing the player later. 

IMO: we need three things to compete for the top of the table: 

- An upgrade at GK

- A proven and dynamic attacking force at striker (pacey, good finishing, and either should be a vertical threat type or a playmaker like Suarez)

- A true Force at DM spot.

Honestly, I wish we could get an upper echelon keeper to replace Mignolet since Bogdan seems more like a good backup option to replace Brad Jones (IMO). 

Also, as much as I like Kovacic and believe in his ability...I don't see why we spend our limited budge there when we have much greater positions of need...not to mention the fact that we will need to replace Sterling. 

I think we can assume that Lallana, Coutinho, Can, and Henderson's roster spots are all locked up. For Kovacic to make any sense for us at £20+ million, we can assume that one of Lucas or Allen will be sold. 

We can also assume that we will try to sell Lambert and Balotelli in favor of a new striker (in addition to Origi and Ings).

Overall, our biggest problem was scoring goals and conceding goals.

""Controlled Chaos"" is what Bilic preaches and it can be a sight to behold if we play it up to potential.

We need quality depth to run this system, because it will be physically demanding. Not as demanding as the Bielsa 3-3-3-1, but Total Football requires all 10 outfield players play two-way football. We will see plenty of rotation and a host of different lineups in an effort to keep the squad fresh between three Cup schedules and the PL schedule. Be thankful our PL schedule this year is so evenly balanced!

I don't want to speculate about signings who haven't been confirmed, but we know that Total Football hinges on three central playmakers pulling the strings. Bilic calls them his magicians. 

I think candidates for these roles are: Downing, Amalfitano, Noble, Zarate, Kouyate, Valencia, Poyet and Obiang. We still need midfield reinforcements, as you can see. Some of these candidates are far from ideal playmakers. Some of them are far better suited to play deep-lying roles.

It incredibly obviously is. And what is especially pathetic is that I've explained to you the reasons why he would have made that distinction and you've just decided that no, you're not going to accept it because reasons.

&gt;I have not and did not pretend to determine his view on that.

You've literally said that you think it's more likely that he supported the invasion to have ""a jolly good war"" than finally getting rid of an infamous murderous tyrant. 

What kind of arsehole are you to make a statement like that? 

&gt;I didn't think I'd have to issue a denial of those ""accusations"" given they are so obviously wrong.

Well it's good to know that you're happy to have it on record that you accept that the war was nothing to do with oil, Blair and Bush aren't particularly evil for starting it, the massive death toll in Iraq since is by far and away the fault of other Muslims/assorted sectarian factions and that coalition forces should, for humanitarian reasons still be in Iraq and Afghanistan now.

&gt;No, I have decided to doubt them. 

Again, for reasons. [eye roll] 

&gt;If we waged wars on the basis of morality...

We don't wage wars on the basis of morality. We wage wars based on an entire laundry list of weighted concerns - from morality, to financial, to strategic, to severity. If you're that ignorant that you can't recognise that even with the fact Saddam had murdered a million of his own people, there was also the fact that the Middle East Saddam was destabilising (and had destabilised for years) was of far greater concern to our lives than any country in Africa - then you have no basis talking on this subject. Which, given that all you've had to offer so far are weak and vague accusations that someone is lying ""because"", ""sardonic"" statements and even more meaningless boilerplate assertions like ""We start wars for political reasons"" - even as you can't even cite any of those reasons at all!

News;

**BBC World Update** - daily news

Educational/Popular science;

**Intelligence Squared** and **Intelligence Squared US** - talks, panel discussions and debates on current affairs

**Stuff to Blow Your Mind** - casual educational podcast about random topics, in a similar vein to Stuff You Should Know

Comedy;

**Pop Culture Happy Hour** - panel discussion of new films, current tv shows, books, all things pop culture-y

**Kumail Nanjiani's X Files Files** - Episode-by-episode discussion of the X Files. Great for an existing fan to follow while re-watching, or for someone just getting into the show.

**Overdue** - discussion of books. If there are any books you feel you ought to read but have never got round to, or ones you don't intend to read but are sort of curious to know what happens, this is the podcast for you. 

**The Worst Bestsellers** - discussion of books and movies that have been wildly successful despite appearing to be dire (think Twilight and 50 Shades). Similar idea to How Did This Get Made, but focusing only on the crap that ended up being a success, and mostly books.

My push mower is older than me (I think it's about 30 years old) and still works fine - no replacement engine parts or blades. The only repair needed was a bolt for the handle, which had rusted through. Starts without any bother, even after sitting in the shed over winter. 
I've had to lend this mower to neighbours on several occasions when their far-newer mowers have broken down. 

The petrol strimmer is of a similar vintage, and also robust. No problems with it, beyond how fiddly it is to get the new cutting wire into it.

My ride-on mower is about 3 years old and is a temperamental piece of shit. It's had to go in for repairs about three times, consistently fails to start properly, has had bits fall off. When it works it reduces the time needed to mow my grass by a factor of about ten, but the build quality is shit. 

So, my advice would be - stick to an electric mower if you can.

It's a tricky question and so first up I will say that if you do not have accommodation booked then you may be in trouble anyway. Hotels get booked up a long, long time in advance and so I would go and try to find somewhere to stay right now! Seriously, that might be the deciding factor for you. 

The first week is the preview week, it's a little cheaper and the acts are a little less polished. Things are getting going and a couple of the acts start late but it's a great week for seeing a huge amount. It does mean there are less reviews and so can be more pot luck. 

Later weeks are all good, but many ofthe big acts will only do limited runs and they tend to be in the middle of the month, so maybe look through the fringe programme and see if there is any big acts you want to see. 

If you come after the first week then everything will be reviewed, so check them out and see what you fancy. If you come in the first week then check the daily reviews, or hang out in bars in the bigger venues and chat to people and see what they have seen that's good. Reviewers are everywhere and so just start a conversation and someone will tell you what to see. 

There are thousands of shows, you'll see some shit and some great stuff, it's all part of it. 

[Have a look at the fringe website](https://tickets.edfringe.com/plan-your-fringe) which has good advice and see what you can work out in advance.

I've finally managed to single out the biggest culprit for my skin irritation: **aloe vera**.

No sensitivity to alcohol or avobenzone as previously suspected. All craps went away when I completely eliminated aloe vera from my routine (it happens to be near the top of the ingredients lists of the products I was using).

I just got my **Skin Actives** package last week and am currently testing out the **Antioxidant Serum with ROS Terminator** on the left side of my face and the **Vitamin C Serum with Ascorbic Acid (L)** on the right. I got the Mix-Yourself Kit for the latter and mixed in around 10-12% (I was using teaspoon so I'm not confident my calculation was precise). I've only been testing them for a few days but all seems well and I've got no irritation or anything from the LAA (I had bad experience in the past with LAA). If this works, my routine will finally be complete: oil cleansing, gentle cleanser, sunscreen, Retin-A, LAA/aox serum and AHA. Yay!

Also, my skin is really loving **SkinCeuticals Retexturing Activator** as hydrator. It seems to exfoliate as well as my skin got smoother but without sun sensitivity as common with more popular exfoliants, so perfect for daytime use.
What's bad is the price tag. At €70 a pop (30ml), my monthly skincare expense doubles. Granted, in this heat, 2-3 drops is more than enough, but still not enough to bring the monthly expense down.

null,false,convertedtoradians,null,null,null,"You haven't got a reply on this and I think it's a good question so I just wanted to throw in my two pence worth. I'm not a ""professional coder"", though I do code as a part of my job. I'm not involved in recruitment or anything either so do take this with a pinch of salt.

I think it's useful for a number of reasons outside of just finding a job that requires specifically the ability to code in a particular language.

1. It shows a familiarity with computers. If suggests that you're better than you probably are, but, to be fair, if you can code competently, you've probably learned a lot of things that can go wrong and how to fix them. You'll know how to use a unfamiliar development environment or command line system and you'll certainly know how to use Google to learn how to do things with unfamiliar software. So, it's basically ""Officially Good At Computers"" on your CV. This is even more important as ""can use office software"" becomes as pointless as writing ""can read and spell own name"".

2. It shows a person with a logical mind who can dissect a problem, understand the different bits of it, decide how best to solve them all, research unfamiliar elements like syntax and then program it all. That's the biggest thing people starting in programming seem to have a problem with; the way the problem needs to be turned into something a computer can do. Even things like ""oh, just put these things in order"" or ""find the nearest one to that one"" can become quite challenging or slow if you get them wrong (or even if you get them right).

3. I hinted at this earlier; it shows an ability to deal with the unfamiliar and with frustration. ""I just want to make THIS do THIS. Why isn't it WORKING?"". This is the battle cry of the programmer. When you start it'll be things like missing semi-colons and whitespace. When you have a few decades of experience it'll be horrendously well-hidden bugs that you'd never think of, but the mindset is the same as is the solution: Get another coffee, go back to the top and start debugging your code. A programmer is patient, is resourceful.

4. It means there's a better than average chance I can make a Star Trek reference and have you understand it.

Right. In the context of a global confrontation with communism the  home of 3000 islanders was sacrificed to provide our main ally with a staging base in the indian ocean. Like I said, greater good.

And the prime minister said it was a terrorist attack. I think it's safe to say this was reported as a religious terrorist attack.

&gt;Regardless as long as the coverage is consistent and they don't give the killers any legitimacy it shouldn't matter.

Yeah and that's the problem - the coverage isn't remotely consistent. When is a white guy doing this ever labelled terrorism? Why does something like the Brevik attacks not get labelled christian extremism and become a story about religion?

This happens with every story, there's no consistency - muslims that kill are labelled terrorists while white people are crazy.

One of the biggest problems of the Euro to date has been the lack of a central bank. You can't have a single currency without having a single central bank to manage it. 

The issue for the EU will be how to ensure the EU doesn't discriminate against those member states such as ourselves, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, etc who are not part of the Eurozone and have no appetite to join. The EU has to represent all 28 member states (27 if either us or Greece leave, 26 if we both do) equally.

That's the view from *us* - yes. 

But it's kind of missing the point. It's in France's best interest (or any other countries) to put as much pressure as possible on other countries to deal with problems like this so that they don't have to. 

In this instance these people want to come into England. France could indeed spend a lot more time and resources on dealing with the issue - but since the people involved want to be *here* it's much easier for them to make it *our* problem. 

No doubt Calais' mayor is under a lot of strain to deal with the issue too. She could spend a lot of time and resources on dealing with this - or deflect the issue on to Britain since that's where all those people are queuing up to be.

[*ob/ob* mice](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Fatmouse.jpg) have broken leptin receptors and eat more, ending up very fat, as you can see.

On this discovery, it was hoped that variations in this system might explain why some people get so overweight, but in reality there's only been a handful of cases where there was actually any functional change in the genes involved.

Anyway, with a high body fat he's used to having a lot of leptin. When the fat is removed, there won't be nearly as much leptin, and so any suppression of his appetite that was happening would also be removed.

This is one of the reasons liposuction isn't really used for large-scale weight reduction - it's very likely to result in you putting it back on. Meanwhile, it does nothing for your insulin sensitivity, stomach size, or atherosclerosis. Much more common is a reduction in the size of the stomach (using a gastric band or bypass). That means that much smaller amounts of food will make you feel just as full, so you can lose weight on your own. It's still hard, but because the weight loss is more gradual the effects of the removal of leptin are more manageable and other aspects of your health can improve.",null,0,null,1434994164,null,0,false,0,csey7vh,null,t3_3ap7vp,null,t1_csey7vh,null,t1_csepjga,null,null,null,1437260013,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

If you're visiting with someone else, it might be worth doing Week 1 so you can take advantage of the two days of 2 for 1 offers. Week 1 is also when you're most likely to pick up free tickets - flyerers will sometimes give these to you in the first few days of their run if they are expecting a reviewer and want a good-sized audience to play to. 

You can look at the reviews from previous Fringes to see what got top ratings, then see if those companies are coming back. There are also bazillions of ""Shows to Watch Out For"" articles out there. Try reading those. 

However, I'd advise you to book as little as possible. The best thing about the Fringe is discovering new things. Walk into a large venue and buy a ticket for whatever is about to start. Get off the beaten track and visit an outlying venue. See a show just because you like the flyer (bonus points if you then hook up with a cast member). Pick something from the brochure at random or let someone who doesn't know you choose. Go to some shows in Free Fringe/Free Festival/Freestival venues. That's how you get the real Fringe experience.

null,false,rjolly,lfc68,,null,"I disagree with some of this list. Why would we sign Begovic to provide competetiton. It would be a waste of money and I don't think it would appeal to anyone. Begovic is a good player although he has had a bit of a poor season. He won't want to sit on the bench. Neither will Mignolet. Plus we just signed Bogdan. Can't promise him to be second choice and then demote him to third choice. Plus you don't need 3 senior keepers.

We don't need Inigo Martinez either. Skrtel and Sakho are both good enough. We have other more important areas to strengthen first.

Also Hernandez is ridiculous. I know you included him as an afterthought but it is ridiculous. The most obvious factor is he is a United player. There is no chance at all that they will sell to us. And I mean that there is no chance. And we ain't going to make a bid for him either. Plus what is the fascination with him it isn't like he is a great player.  He really is a player who would probably struggle with us. If you have ever watched him play you would see that he does nothing himself. 

He relies on everyone else to do the work for him and then he scores goals. But the other players will do 90% of the work for him to score a tap in or a 1on1. The point is that we are awful at creating decent chances. We won't create chances for him and so he wont score. He is an extreme poacher. There is a reason why United had him at 4th choice, why they played Welbeck over him, even Mexico fans don't rate him too highly, they don't consider him their best player. Also the fact that he plays for United. If his contract was up then maybe the deal could happen but there is no way both clubs would agree a fee. United aren't going to ask for a serious fee from us. Plus he might have a bit of decency and loyalty and not join his clubs rivals.

Ade would be very hard to get rid of - wages, done pretty crap the last 3 seasons.

&gt;BBC is good, its not worth fining people over (and eventually prison).

BBC is good. BBC Radio is good. iPlayer is good. Internet services are good. Kids channels are good. Kids *websites* are unequalled. You're complaining about people who have refused to pay £12 a month under the assumption they won't be fined, and then have assumed if they don't pay the fine they won't be imprisoned - again, removing the stages between not paying a relatively small charge and prison doesn't really make those stages go away.

&gt; I've said my point, my part of this discussions is over.

You've said your point, but haven't validated it - which doesn't really matter, I'm not trying to convince you of anything - I'm replying so that others who think your approach is valid give it more consideration :-)

null,false,unholyarmy,null,null,null,"Firstly go for a Halifax Reward Current Account NOT a Halifax Ultimate Reward Current Account. The first is free, the second costs money each month for things you will probably never use. 

I have been with Halifax for about 20 years, and haven't got any complaints like NotQuiteStupid has, but admittedly I haven't thrown anything to complicated at them in a few years. 

Bullet points as requested: 

* Use Halifax's switching service to open a ""Halifax Reward Current Account""
* Wait until the dust has settled and you are happy all DDs have moved that are supposed to
* Open a Santander 123 Current Account without a switching service
* Manually switch over DDs that are eligible for cashback to Santander
* 2 DDs need to be left behind in Halifax in order to qualify for the £5 per month
* Move your savings into Santander up to the limit of £20k
* It is up to you which account you treat as your main current account. 
 * Ideally since Halifax pays £5 a month regardless of the balance in the account (as long as £750 has been paid in during the month and there are 2 DDs out), you want to keep the balance in there as close to zero as you can since that money earns no interest. 
 * For this reason I would suggest moving your salary to Santander, and having your daily spending come out of Santander. However if you are the kind of person who will spend money if you have a positive balance in your current account, this is not a good idea. 
* So assuming you use Santander as your main current account, (and savings account): 
 * Have the salary paid into Santander
 * Set up a standing order for £750 across to Halifax each month
 * Set up a standing order from Halifax to Santander each month 5 days after the one from Santander to Halifax for £750 + £5 - the cost of the two DDs (Make sure they are fixed value DDs)
 * Leave £10 as your standing balance in Halifax (Any amount will do).

The reason I say 5 days is because I wouldn't anything stupid like bank holidays interfere with the ordering of the standing orders and somehow have the Halifax money go out before the Santander money has gone in, putting you into an overdraft. 

If you want the Halifax as your main account, then most things stay the same, just have the Salary paid into Halifax, Set up a standing order in each direction for £500 to meet the Santander criteria, and then move any excess money you have each month into Santander to get that sweet 3% interest.

She would easily save £6000 a year by moving out of London and getting a railcard.

I also saw a SpareRoom advert where a girl was desperately hunting for a room in Clapham or Brixton, that general area.  ""If I could sort something soon that would be great, else I'll go back to my parents' home in Fulham until something comes up!"".  The girl was some generic PR wonk and not exactly a City gazillionaire.  Her brain also seems to have evacuated at some point.

The big problem I'm seeing in London is that affordable ""hidden gems"" (i.e. decent travel time and not too stabby) soon become overrun, ""gentrified"", and ultimately as overcrowded and overpriced as everywhere else.

The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or Isis, is a murderous group which believes the west is decadent, democracy is wrong and women are inferior. Why anyone living in the comparative comfort of a British city would join such a medieval movement in Syria or Iraq is hard to fathom. Yet Isis has a growing appeal to young Muslims in Britain, an issue of concern not only for the UK security services but for many Islamic leaders too.


Last Saturday, Talha Asmal, a 17-year-old student from West Yorkshire, detonated a car full of explosives at an Iraqi security facility, becoming Britain’s youngest suicide bomber. On Wednesday, three sisters from Bradford and their nine children crossed into Syria and joined Isis, abandoning their grieving husbands. They are the latest in the growing number of Britons, now about 700, who have joined the jihadis in the Levant.


The flow of recruits is disturbing. These are British citizens, many of whom are contributing to death and mayhem abroad; some will return home and may try to commit terrorist acts on British soil. The intelligence services have had considerable success in the past decade unravelling jihadi plots. But the surge of followers joining Isis poses a serious security threat.


There is no simple explanation for why young people are drawn to the warped ideology of jihad. The notion that they are angered by western foreign policy is inadequate, given that Isis is fighting Muslim militaries. It cannot be blamed on social deprivation since many recruits are from comfortable backgrounds. It is also wrong to blame Muslim theology. While Isis may cast itself as representing a pure Islamism, many Muslim scholars denounce it.


Two issues deserve deeper debate, however. One was raised by David Cameron in a speech on Friday when he rightly said that the extremist ideology of Isis is being “quietly condoned” in parts of the UK’s 2.8m strong Muslim population. This is a complex community and we should avoid sweeping judgments. But parts of it could do more to confront the radicalism in their midst. As Shahid Malik, a Labour MP, said this week: “Every mosque should be — and isn’t — making clear in no uncertain terms what is unacceptable in Islam vis-à-vis [Isis].”


Much more should also be done to confront the jihadi online preachers who groom recruits. Many of those who travel to Syria and Iraq seem to have been converted over the internet. This week, Lord Carlile, the former terrorism watchdog, called for a “counter-narrative” to be developed on the internet, one that rejects jihad. Internet companies should work with moderate Muslim leaders to achieve this.


The prime minister needs to ensure his own approach is right. He is planning tougher curbs on non-violent extremism, including banning some Islamist preachers from spreading their messages. This risks appearing like a crackdown on free speech and may alienate many Muslims. It would be better to focus on the role of Saudi Arabia. Despite Britain’s close commercial ties with Riyadh, it should put the kingdom on notice that its Wahhabi proselytism — through mosques, schools and textbooks across the world — is a primary stimulus of Islamist extremism and will not be tolerated.


Defeating the jihadi preachers who poison young Muslim minds will be a long and painful task. It requires each section of the community to face its responsibilities. This government has — so far — been wise to avoid passing draconian laws to counter extremism. But parts of Britain’s Muslim community must, in turn, speak up against the dangerous ideology in their midst.

As you can see, the situation is complicated. 

Essentially, we've extended our boarder into France. This means that we can go 'non' when they ask to pass and they remain Frances problem. 

If they were to tear up that treaty we couldn't stop them just letting anyone on the boats/euro-tunnel that buys a ticket. Our boarder would be in Dover. So they'd make it to the UK and then regardless of if we let them in or not, they're then our problem. 

Obviously France should be doing more to keep them out of France in the first place, but it's certainly not as simple as it being all their fault. 

If our boarders worked like most other countries boarders then the majority of the illegal immigrants in Calais wouldn't be there. They'd all be over here instead.

Everyone is trying to find ways to ignore the problem. In the UK it's that we're not in Schengen so have opt outs. In France they're threatening to close the border with Italy, they just want Italy to deal with it. The only long term solutions are:

- Accept them EU wide via quotas
- Find another country or countries that will accept them outside the EU

The ABC has improved a heck of a lot over the last decade. There was a time when I thought everything they did was rubbish and I would have 100% agreed with that statement, but now there are quite a few shows that are done well and I think that is somewhat unfair. It's based on a reputation from the past, albeit fairly recent past.

As for the idea that the BBC is independent from government, this was proven to be BS when they became the Bush Blair Corporation and just repeated everything those two wanted so they could invade Iraq. The ABC has proven to be far more impartial than that, and they are funded directly by the government, so I think the empirical information in our face shows that the licence system doesn't really work as a mechanism to separate government from the BBC. It just gives an appearance of it on the surface. It also shows that the BBC could be impartial when funded directly by the government.

Granted play overall has been a bit sub-par and Bacca has, for the most part, been paired with a catatonic Falcao, I harbor some serious doubts about signing a 28 year-old striker who manages to score 20 goals in the for Sevilla in La Liga. Correct me if I'm wrong, but hasn't that proven to be a difficult transition for the most part, and one where production at that level doesn't necessarily translate to the top of the Premier League?

I think what concerns me most is that he didn't appear to demonstrate much of an ability to help create chances. Granted that this was an ideal scenario, but I think one of Suarez and Sturridge's best attributes as a tandem was not just their clinical finishing but their ability and desire to interchangeably work to help create chances. 

There's definitely a chance that he could come here and be successful with good service from the likes of Phil, Hendo, Lallana, Milner, etc. And perhaps should Studge manage to stay healthy, they could combine to make a great tandem. It could definitely work, and I can't really come up with a much better option off the top of my head, but I have my concerns.

If we're going to spend big on an ""aging"" (ish) Colombian striker, I'd MUCH prefer Jackson Martinez, but I concede that we have no chance at beating out Arsenal, Inter/Milan, Atletico, and others. I can't for the life of me fathom why Beckerman uses him as Colombia's 4th or even 5th option at striker, especially given the shocking lack of production from his first choices. The best player on the team (up for debate of course but he had a FINE season at Porto and especially in CL competitions) can barely get off the bench. Go figure. 

Anyways, disagreements/clarifications welcome and appreciated. At the end of the day I'll take anyone that can help the club win. Cheers.

I think in total it took about a year and a half before I got a job, but arguably the first year or so was just casual messing around in my spare time. I learnt the very basics when I had some time to kill, and it was only in the last six months or so that I formed some kind of structure.

I made a list of the things that I wanted to be able to do and what I'd need to know to do them, and worked towards them as broad goals. I'd recommend Team Treehouse for video tutorials (ignore the first couple of videos, they're a bit silly but the rest are rather good with great resources) and Derek Banas videos on YouTube are also rather great. I'd also check out the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming with Simon Allardice: he was really helpful for me in regards to getting my head around certain concepts.

Just as a little piece of advice (at least, it worked for me) is maybe don't jump headfirst into everything at once - I think with programming it's very easy to immediately get overwhelmed and turned off the whole thing. I actually think the way I (completely accidentally) approached it worked quite well, in that I learned a bit, let it sink it without feeling overwhelmed and then learned more when I felt the need to. As you learn more and more, your interest grows and you want to learn more without artificially forcing yourself to sit down and study. At least, that was my experience - your mileage may vary.

null,false,bl0ndearabist,null,null,null,"Well, this is exciting. After being glued to this subreddit for the last week and several rounds of mental doubting and calculations, I was finally able to get to the shops.

Type: oily/(hormonal/stress-induced)acne-prone/dehydrated
Concerns: dehydration - I'd like my foundation not to stick to dry patches - and calming the stress induced breakouts that haven't left me for the past few months 

I bought:
**Johnson's Baby First Touch Oil** - 200ml for £2.59?! (The Boots own-brand 300ml with two other additives I had never heard of before was about the same price but I wasn't sure about the two other ingredients besides the mineral oil) Anyway I want to give this a shot since I discovered the Una Brennan Cleansing Oil I was using for double-cleansing had olive and grape seed oil although sunflower as the carrier. (I'm convinced my skin is ripe for some serious grit as they call them over on /r/SkincareAddiction removal, but that's not necessarily my primary concern. It would be nice though.)

**Superdrug Simply Pure Hydrating Serum x2** - if this is the dupe for the Eve Lom Instant Hydrating Serum I hope it is (or better, from reviews), I will be so happy.

**Superdrug Vitamin E Leave-On Moisture Mask** to try as a summer moisturiser (the Shiseido Ibuki Enhanced Refining Mosituriser was just way too heavy and I'm not totally convinced by the Nivea Pure &amp; Natural Moisturising Day Cream for Normal to Combination Skin although I may need to return to it (except on my nose/t-zone I think) if the clash of silicones in the Simply Pure serum and this mask leads to peeling.

**Vaseline** 250g, to use an occlusive, perhaps twinned with the baby oil as OCM, for when I'm feeling brave enough/not grossed out.

**LRP Anthelious XL Ultra-Light Fluid SPF50+** - it was almost a fiver off in Boots at £12.37 and it was only when I got home I realised they have a specifically oily version (Anti-Shine) but this is only for a month away/to last me until October (and no more need for SPF) and saves me spending £30-odd on the Clarins or Shiseido Urban Environment SPFs I was planning. Does the jury have an opinion on this?

I also picked up some **Johnson's** baby wash and shampoo - I think my skin isn't particularly keen on my shampoo and body wash now that I've significantly increased my gym attendance and therefore showering sometimes twice a day, so I'll start with these (separately I think I need to start deploying my cleanser, AHA serum from **Dermalogica** and a mosituriser on my decollete). Not to forget the blotting paper from **Muji** (they call it cosmetic paper) - £1.50 for 100 sheets. Bargain.

Intended routine once I integrate these: 

AM

Cleanse: **Shiseido Ibuki Gentle Cleanser**

Sweep: **Boots Distilled Witchhazel**

[Antioxidant: **SR Vitamin C Serum** - from September]

Tone: **Shiseido Ibuki Softening Concentrate**

Serum: **Superdrug Clearly Youthful Hydrating Day  Booster Serum** (anyone got an opinion on this?)

Moisturise: **Avene Cleanance Mat** or **Superdrug Vitamin E Leave-On Moisture Mask** (these two depend on whether the silicones clash or not) or **Nivea Pure &amp; Natural Moisturising Day Cream Normal/Combination Skin**

SPF: work in progress


PM

Oil: **Johnson's Baby First Touch Oil** or **Superfacialist Vitamin C Skin Renew Cleansing Oil** (will use the Superfacialist if it turns out it's ok - sigh, I hope so, it's a brand new bottle)

Cleanse: **Shiseido Ibuki Gentle Cleanser**

Sweep: **Boots Distilled Witchhazel**

Exfoliator: **Dermalogica Skin Renewal Booster** (every other night)

Toner: **Shiseido Ibuki Softening Concentrate**

Serum: **Superdrug Simply Pure Hydrating Serum**

Moisturiser: I'm betwixt-and-between on this - I normally use an oil (currently **Manuka Doctor Normalising Facial Oil** - it reeks, takes *forever* to sink in and I haven't been paying attention to how effective it actually is), but it seems a moisturiser is most common and recommended post-serum. I may end up doing **Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Concentrate**, then the **Manuka Doctor** oil and/or **Vichy Normaderm Night Detox**.

Spending the last few days increasing the hydration of my skin meant when I applied **LRP Effaclar Duo+** to a red and slightly inflamed area of skin earlier today (I picked, I'm sorry) it *ACTUALLY* worked. Previously it had been useless to me. When paired with a routine that does actually help your skin (minor differences on above), it seems it does indeed do what it says on the tin.

null,false,noggin-scratcher,null,null,null,"The amount of interest you're due is calculated daily. That daily amount is accumulated until the end of the month when it's paid into your account.  For compound interest purposes, you would only start receiving interest on your interest once it was in your account, so compounding monthly. But if your balance changes for any other reason then that will be reflected in the daily interest calculations and hence also the monthly payment.

Taking 3% and dividing by 365 will get you *close* to the daily figure, but a little off because to convert to a daily rate for compound interest you're actually trying to solve (1+x)^(365) -1 = 0.03, not 365\*x = 0.03 ... except wait, that's not quite right unless you're getting the interest payments daily. What you *actually* want is to use simple interest within the month and compound between months, which would give us (1+(30\*x))^(12) -1 = 0.03  
Which is a daily rate of x = 0.000082209

i.e. If you're credited with 0.0082209% on the same fixed balance every day for 30 days before the sum is paid, and then that same effective rate every month for 12 months, then that's 3% interest for the year. Whereas taking 3% and dividing by 365 would give you a figure of 0.0082192% which compounds back up to 3.05% 

That's a difference of what... 50p per year per £1000 in the account; a change from £30 to £30.50. So if you're aiming to be absolutely penny-accurate then there's a bit more math involved (and if you **really** want penny-accuracy you'd have to combine that with a habit of checking and recording your balance every day, and also making sure you record it at the same time as the bank does), but dividing by 365 will get you acceptable close.",null,0,null,1435001589,null,0,1435002988,0,csf2ynz,null,t3_3algjb,null,t1_csf2ynz,null,t1_csdtlfb,null,null,null,1437263581,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

null,false,360Saturn,null,null,null,"I have always wondered if - in fact theorised that - the reason fees are so high for everyone is because the costs of teaching each subject are averaged.

Sure, it makes it accessible for a medical or physics student to not have to pay over ten grand a year for the access to the labs and equipment they need to learn their trade and to be able to do their projects, but the downside is that humanities, languages and cultural studies students are then paying through the nose for what basically amounts to a few hours of staff contact a week.

I've just finished a Masters, and it definitely wasn't worth the money. In effect, if you divide the fees by the teaching time, if your fees were going directly to the services you consume, your professors are getting paid over £200 an hour for their time. Now obviously that's not the case, so if it's not that the fees are averaged, which middle man is taking the lion's share of them?

EDIT: Also, I should add that university fees just seem to pay for you through the door - I really to this day have no idea what they pay for. Per semester you're expected to pay 50-100 pounds on books and other resources (if you're lucky they don't demand you get the newest editions, although those are normally 'recommended'), and then of course printing out your papers and getting them bound costs money too, because nothing can just be submitted electronically despite it being 2015.

Got into Gatwick ~1:00pm local time. Took the train to Victoria station. Dropped my pack at a left luggage facility (thanks for the suggestions!) Went walking about, taking pictures. I went past Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, The Palace, and walked through the park in that area. Saw some pipe and drum practice, marveled at all the people driving on the opposite side of the road. 

Took the Southern rail to Brighton, got in around 6pm, checked in and dropped my gear. Went to the Regency Inn for fish and chips and a room-temperature Guinness. Delicious. Was confused when I received my bill and had no line to add a tip. Left a five pound note for the bewildered (and pretty) waitress.

Wednesday was full of meetings, but had the chance to be taken to dinner by my UK counterparts. We did lunch at the Gingerman, and dinner at 24st Georges. Wandered around near the beach for a bit.

Thursday was a half day of meetings. Lunch was at the Salt Room, which was next to my hotel (The Hilton Metropole). I had a few Pimm's cups (Our party ended up drinking all the Pimm's they had).

It was absolutely gorgeous, nearly 75 degrees! (Relating this to my UK counterparts, I was met with blank stares. I did some half-assed math and quickly said ""Oh, about 20 celcius?"") My hosts and a few passerby agreed that it's not typically that nice that time of the year. We spent the afternoon/evening on the beach in Brighton, then headed to Casa Don Carlos for excellent tapas and then wandered around looking for someone that would deep fry a Mars bar for us (we were getting a little tipsy at that point). We had a few cocktails at the Grand Hotel until we were nearly falling asleep.

Staggered back to my hotel and packed up.

Friday, I had a 4 hour layover in Dublin, so I had them pour me a proper pint. It was cold. Having had it at room temperature now, I'd have to say I prefer it that way.

Thanks again for the suggestions on where to go and help with the trains!

I'd love to come back and spend some more time, but I feel like I hit a few quick highlights (Fish and Chips, Westminster Abbey, Pimm's Cup, Swam (in) the Channel, brought home some pound coins for the kids to lose), did the business that I was sent to do, and had some good photos and souvenirs.

A few quick impressions from an outsider:
Everyone was awfully polite.
No fog. Sunny every day. So much for those stereotypes. A bit windy, though.
The girls dress a bit... different... than the girls I see in Chicago. Slightly flashier jewelry, brighter colors of lipstick. It was neat seeing a different set of features than I've grown accustomed to.
Also, men in capri pants. That's not a popular look over here. Or maybe I just don't want it to be.
People aren't as offended by noise, or others don't care? There were a lot of phone ringtones and people just listening to music with no headphones on the trains.
Nobody uses the Euro at all. I was warned about this and only changed into pounds. 
For not having a credit card with a 'chip', I had no problem buying anything. Everyone was able to swipe.
Your wifi is generally slower than I've become accustomed to.
It was impossible to watch the Blackhawks winning the Stanley Cup. I had a friend skype me and turn her cam to the TV during the game. I know, what do I have to complain about?
Brighton reminded me a lot of San Francisco(hilly, older, a little crowded together) as well as Santa Cruz (beach community, laid back, gets crowded in the summer).

My god...when you get to know them it's almost like muslims are no different from white people!

Eventually we sort of squished him down the stares with one of us holding the head and three pulling him down by the legs. We had no way of lifting him. Every step his behind would impact the step followed by a bang as his shoulders and head hitting each step.

We got him round into the living room while the family were next door. They explained he had not left the house in a year and they brought him food so he could eat. They heard the whole struggle and the head banging the steps on the way down which I'm sure is lovely.

He wouldn't fit through the main door to the house. It just wasn't viable without us doing our backs in or getting his body stuck half way.

null,false,nicotineapache,english,Smoggie in Mancland,null,"Of course, you're asking final year students who can't really know if their time at university has been worth it. I've just finished my MSc at Salford Uni, finishing 5 consecutive years as a full-time student.

The first two years (Foundation Degree, Music Production) were well worth the £1500 a year they cost for the sheer amount of knowledge, guidance, experience, fun and inspiration that they brought me.

The 3rd year was iffy (Professional Broadcast Techniques BSc) because the amount of support felt greatly reduced and I'm fairly sure the qualification itself was bullshit, but it did get me first class honours and some wider skills in video editing/web design. All of which took me onto an MSc in Audio Production.

Two months down the line and one month from graduation and I'm working in the industry (both music and events) as a musician and an engineer. I've got loads of prospects, plenty of contacts and while the work is there, things are looking very good. Crucially, I'm earning money. I doubt I'd have that without the qualifications that I got through university, which started with something that I'm sure many would write off as not serious, being a Music Production Foundation Degree.

On my third year, I heard a lot of moaning and complaining about the poor standards of the BSc and the university itself. I'm sure at least 40% would have said that the course was not good value. What I tried to argue is that the university can't do the work for you. It's going to be down to your own motivation whether or not you succeed and the course proves to be value for money. You have to be driven and take risks. I rang around production companies and happened to speak to one of my old peers, who got me in touch with their audio guy, who is now giving me work because I impressed him. The universities can only give you so much. You have to do your share or it won't be value for money.",null,0,null,1435003004,null,0,false,0,csf3vst,null,t3_3aostb,null,t1_csf3vst,null,t3_3aostb,null,null,null,1437264208,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null
