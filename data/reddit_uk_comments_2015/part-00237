Maybe, just maybe, they were running at a loss because they were staffed with disabled people who aren't going to be as productive as non-disabled members of society?

If the losses are greater than the cost of disability benefits for these people then fine, they should be shut down. Alternatively if the losses are less than the cost of disability benefits then someone sucks at economics. Considering that staff salaries are usually by far the highest cost of running a buesiness I'd be surprised if it was the first option.

null,false,convertedtoradians,null,null,null,"Honestly, I'd say C. Python is easy, and there are lots of flashy resources to learn it and it's newer and trendier. Lots of people would recommend it, I'm sure, and I certainly wouldn't say it was a bad thing.

So, why wouldn't I recommend it? Well, it feels a bit *too* easy sometimes. You're not really aware of the complexity of what you're doing, because Python hides that away from you. And that's fine when you're following an online course, but then when you need to think your way round the problem, you might find you lack a crucial part of the mental toolkit.

C on the other hand is a workhorse. You can code pretty much anything from an operating system all the way through to in-depth games if you have the patience. It's also much less forgiving.

For example, it forces you to specify every variable you're going to use in your code and what type it is. I don't know how much you know about coding, but you use ""variables"" to store information. Each one has a name so you can refer to it later. There's a difference between, say, a variable that holds a character like the letter ""a"", a variable that holds a whole number like 6, a number with a decimal point like 8.2 and so on. In Python, you can just say ""gimme a variable called 'Alan', stick an whole number in it, now stick a character in it, now do this with it..."". In C, you have to say ""okay, get a variable ready. It'll hold a decimal and it'll be called 'Alan'. I'll let you know when I need it.""

The way it's much less forgiving, in my opinion, makes you a better coder.

Also: If you've learned C, it's *much* easier to go to... well... practically any other language you're likely to want to use than it is to go from Python to another language.

Outside of C and Python, Java is quite popular. I don't do much with it myself, but it's quite big in the mobile game development industry (I think...). It's quite C-like in how it works. Fortran is only really likely to be useful if you're interested in academia. C++ is very similar to C but adds some powerful new ways of dealing with some things that you might one day need but probably don't need to worry about straight away. C# I can't comment on because I don't know it. I've barely used Ruby either, though it's in the Python-type group of languages. I also won't comment on ""web"" languages like HTML and PHP; they're a different kettle of fish entirely, designed to (as you know from your MySpace days) decide how and what information is displayed.

Also, at the risk of sounding like a snob, everyone and his granny is ""learning python"" these days; they've got an account on codeacademy and played around with it for a couple of hours a few months ago. This is a horrendous generalisation which I'm sure someone will come along and condemn me for making, but if all I knew was that someone was a ""python coder"", I'd be less impressed than if I knew the same someone was a ""C coder"".

Of course, if you're learning for fun and to spruce up a CV, if you're not sure if you'll enjoy it, don't have all that long to devote or just fancy it, then you should definitely start with python, dive in and have fun. There's absolutely no reason that route can't get you everywhere you want to go.

- Not everyone pays the [same rate but it comes from the same pot](https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-rates-letters/contribution-rates). For example over a certain tax threshold you only pay 2% NI &amp; some people pay nothing. 

- What you pay in is not saved, it is spent immediately on those currently claiming, [therefore in the future rates or retirement age will have to rise to provide the same benefits.](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/336829/QR_2010_report_17_July_2014.pdf) As an example, those currently claiming their pension are being paid from a pot funded via a 12% rate for most people. This means the government can promise a nice triple lock pension. But they didn't pay a 12% rate for that pension, they paid a much lower rate, for example in 1978 it was only 6.5%.

- Due to the above point pensioner benefits will slowly get worse as there are less people to pay for it, even if they pay in at the same rate. Essentially they're not getting the same for their money. 

This is why it's vastly different to a regular pension &amp; should be seen more as a benefit like jobseekers allowance, which is also paid via NI contributions.

It really depends on what sort of work you want to do, but pretty much all of Northern England has lower living costs than the South. Check out Leeds and Manchester which are cheaper to live in but have heaps of things going on and plenty of job opportunities.

Did you leave your job voluntarily? (i.e. quit?). You usually **wont be able to claim full Job Seekers Allowance** (the dole). Keep that in mind; you'll have to live off only your savings if you don't plan on getting a job immediately.

Now I may have oversimplified it by saying he's a Belgian Andy Carroll(my own view is also skewed as I don't rate Benteke as highly as some I think he's limited), but it's basically true. Benteke is a player who is better suited to play on the counter or as an out and out target man(ala Carroll). If we want to play this pressing, possession game, it isn't his strength. It'll be another Balotelli all over again, although I'd expect Benteke to be able to adapt better, you're still  not playing to his strengths. 

Just to be clear, I think Bacca is similar again(which is why I wouldn't like to spend upwards of £22mill), but he does have better awareness.

Establish a routine - for example, spend mondays and wednesdays trawling jobhunting sites, tuesday you hit the streets and hand out CV's to pubs, cafes, supermarkets, phone shops, poundlands, etc, thursday you work on a business plan to start your own company, friday you canvas ex colleagues for whatever they've got going.

Factor in travel time - if it takes you an hour to reach the nearest big town or shopping centre, count that towards your total. Let's say five CV's an hour with walking time and breaks - ten CV's handed out, that's 4 hours.

If you've already joined loads of jobsearch sites, don't own up to it right away. Signup process is good for half an hour, with another half hour trawling for jobs and 20 mins to apply for each one, what with writing a spiffy new cover letter for each application, redrafting your CV to suit, etc...ten jobs applied for on your new signup to Fish4Jobs? That's another 4 hours...

Meeting an ex colleague for lunch because he had info about an internal vacancy you could apply for? that's another 2.5 hours minimum.

Got a call from a recruitment agency? half hour right there.

Sign up for plenty of email alerts from jobsearch sites. If you can take your phone out and show them your email bursting with alerts, that'll go in your favour. Factor in a good couple of hours every day going through them with a fine tooth comb.

Bear in mind that I was with a very understanding jobcentre who didn't have time to check the veracity of everything I said I did, so there was plenty of room for fudging and exaggeration which may not be available to you.

Good luck, get creative. Don't despair.

Oh, and when you go to sign on, or when you have jobsearch interviews, be sure to be enthusiastic and ask them about training schemes or placements they have. Watch for notices about job fairs and seasonal vacancies on their cubicles or staff boards. Showing interest int hose won't only prove your motivation face-to-face, it'll distract them from your subpar jobsearch record.",null,0,null,1435008452,null,0,false,0,csf7ci2,null,t3_3ar593,null,t1_csf7ci2,null,t3_3ar593,null,null,null,1437266801,null,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15,null

One of the issues we had when looking for candidates for an entry level C# position was that none of them had spent any time actually writing any code that was not mandated by their course, at least not anything worth talking about in an interview.

A computer science degree is useless if you can't demonstrate in the interview that you can actually write some damn code and display the ability to think logically and work through a problem.

Basically, if once you graduate you're still at the stage of throwing code at the computer and hoping for the best or once you do get something working you ""don't really understand why"" then you're not going to be employable because you're too much of a liability. It'll cost too much to have someone hold your hand for a year only to discover that you haven't got what it takes.

Of course you don't need to spend every waking moment outside of school or university coding, but if this is the career you want you need to pick a couple of good personal projects and work through them from start to finish and have a good understanding of what you're trying to achieve and why the code you're writing does what it does, and importantly, be able to talk about it at the interview. If you do show something off, make sure it is actually something worth showing off. If I see it and think ""Yeah, I could write that in 20 minutes"" things aren't going to go well for you.

I don't expect you be be able to architect an enterprise level system, to have perfect understanding of how to design a database schema, or to be familiar with whatever frameworks we happen to use. But if I do give you a task to write a 50 line function requiring only simple code and basic objects from the class library (string, lists, etc) then I don't expect you to end up with an incoherent mess at the end of it.

To give you an example of one of my personal projects. When I first learned C# just out of university (I didn't actually do CS at uni (did civil engineering then changed my mind), and prior to that I'd mostly worked in VB6 (yeah, eww, I know)) I wrote a DKP system for my WoW guild which consisted of a client-server application with a SQL server database and a web front-end for guild members to look up their information.

It gave me a chance to test writing the 'full stack' so to speak, database design (had never done it before that), server, networking, security (password hashing, sql injection and the like), etc. I could have talked about that in an interview for hours if I had to.

So yeah, in conclusion. If you want a good job, make an effort now!",null,0,null,1435009303,null,0,1435010410,0,csf7vf2,null,t3_3anuy7,null,t1_csf7vf2,null,t1_csf5oi2,null,null,null,1437267223,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Then there's the other side of that particular coin in that Arsenal could well be also removing their current No.2. So, using the logic I've garnered from a few days of reading comments herein about Cech, they're replacing their No.1 with an injury prone player and they have no No.2.

I think I did 10/15 hours a week when I was on, but it was 10/15 GOOD hours. As long as you log everything you do and it looks substantial you're fine. Obviously you tell them that it was 35 hours of work that you did though. Don't worry if some of the jobs don't quite fit the role you are meant/want to be looking for, just make sure you throw a CV at some jobs and log it on the website they have you sign up for. 

Spend a bit of time filling out a few varied CV's that you can give to different jobs according to what they are looking for. This will save you a lot of time because editing your CV on a hob-by-job basis is soul destroying. Just get it done first. I made my CV very modular, with different paragraphs I threw in according to what might be needed. Sending an appropriate CV was nothing more than a couple of copy paste jobs and it was away.

They will probably have set you objectives to hit each week (Do they still do that?), you get a say in what they are, I always set mine at at least X amount of 'jobs inquired' per day. That can mean asking about your suitability for the work, necessary qualifications, handing in CVs, etc. JUST MAKE SURE YOU LOG EVERYTHING YOU DO.

null,false,Chlorophilia,null,null,null,"Why shouldn't we use domestic gas and export the excess?

1. Because of the many environmental issues already discussed above and the fact that gas from hydraulic fracturing is not as ""clean"" as natural gas from other sources so isn't ""twice as clean as coal"" by output. And of course, the social issues you mention.

2. There really aren't any economic savings to be made, the argument for fracking is more geopolitical (about energy security) than financial. And even if there were, do you seriously think they'd be invested in renewable energy? Of course not, they're going to be paid as dividends to Cuadrilla's shareholders probably.

3. It sets up a completely new, unsustainable energy infracture at a time when we should be dismantling a hydrocarbon-based energy infrastructure. Investment in renewables and fracking-technology are not mutually exclusive but the entire fracking argument devotes an awful lot of political energy towards fossil fuels and away from renewables progress. On top of that, I would wager that a lot of the government's support for fracking comes from the personal links between MPs and the industry... At least that's the interpretation you get from the number of ""meetings"" they have.

And regarding a consensus, who gets to make that consensus? If you mean scientists in general, there is broad support against fracking - more than twice the number of members of the AAAS oppose fracking than support it. But I'm not convinced that's really the statistic that matters - this isn't a question where the answer can simply be determined by consensus of any particular party. Whether or not fracking is a ""good"" thing isn't as objective a question as ""Are humans the dominant drivers of climate change"" which clearly is a question a consensus can answer. This is a very strategic question about the best way to decarbonise our energy infrastructure. I can understand the pragmatic argument that people put forward in favour of fracking but I am absolutely unconvinced that it outweighs the very serious environmental and social costs and I am also quite certain that the heavy industry support is unbalancing the debate.

(I will admit, as a conflict of interest, that I am very left wing so there it would be extremely difficult for me to support an industry like fracking in the current economic situation anyway)",null,0,null,1435010512,null,0,1435010751,0,csf8m5j,null,t3_3ap1nq,null,t1_csf8m5j,null,t1_csf8579,null,null,null,1437267603,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I'm blaming the universities here to an extent, it can takes years to really get to grip with the fundamentals of coding. They really should be encouranging you to practice coding right from the start of the course, in fact ideally your secondary school should be telling you to have a go at it the moment you indicate you have any interest in pursuing that course.

Personally I started with QBasic when I was about 10 or so, maybe earlier. I was writing my own games in my early teens during DirectX and OpenGL and my first 'professional' application was written when I was about 14 (paid a lot better than a paper round that's for sure!) and is still in use today.

null,false,JunglistMassive,,GLORIOUS RED SAUCE ARMY,null,"&gt;I've still not worked out how highlighting West Belfast's welfarism problem is ""sectarian"" (especially when the problem pertains to BOTH catholic AND protestant communities in the constituency).

Perhaps Sectarianism is so normalised for you you have difficulty in adressing your own; I doubt very much you had the Shankill in mind when you deliberately drew a distinction **between welfare recipients and Sinn Féins electoral strategy**; the inference was quite clear and entirely sectarian in its intent. It's quite an [old trope](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dZJOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=Lazy+Catholics+Northern+Ireland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KPwUAdlIju&amp;sig=O4XVRXEZ85dNZ7amkSj4qXurk9I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lXuIVd3fG8S1UZmFgcAM&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Lazy%20Catholics%20Northern%20Ireland&amp;f=false). 

&gt;Similarly old fashioned but popular notions included the belief that Catholics were lazy, slothful and feckless. The Belfast Board of Guardians, for example, responsible for determining outdoor relief for the unemployed in the city, record in their minutes that it was their obligation 'faced with such sloth, fecklessness and iniquity', 'to discourage idleness and create a spirit of independence'. They were fearful of large Catholic families being a burden on the ratepayers, who were disproportionately Protestant under regulations designed to protect local election majorities. The Catholic poor were all too willing to beg instead of work but showed no poverty under the blankets', as a Chair of the Board once said. Some Protestant clergy criticised poor Catholics who were a 'wastrel class' and asked the Board to cut grants 'to parasites' (see Bardon, 1992: 525). Goldring (1991: 48) argues that the Board were Calvinists who believed that poverty was a judgement from God and that after partition the Board saw themselves as in the front line of a war to maintain a Protestant majority. They were thus intent on preventing Catholics from getting relief. Protestants were unemployed because they confronted unfortunate circumstances, Catholics because they wasted money on gambling and drink, and made no effort to find work (ibid.).[source](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/sectarian/brewer.htm)

I find little difference in your assertions and these older examples. Whilst you try and dress your sectarianism up as an economic analysis, and even more absurdly as libertarianism old prejudices are very clear to be seen.

You skew the narrative of the disproportionate level of violence and historical lack of jobs and opportunity in West Belfast. The case of West Belfast and it's ""Welfarism"" correlates precisely with the lack of state investment in the area, say compared to East Belfast which suffers from it's own form of ""Welfarism""; for example it recieved 13.27 Million in 2012 and [28.62 Million in 2011] (http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/globalassets/Documents/RaISe/Constituency-Profiles/2012/belfast_east.pdf) from Invest NI compared with the paltry sum of [£360,000 in West Belfast in 2011](http://belfastmediagroup.com/invest-ni-in-the-dock-again-over-west-record/).

- Unless they register in Italy France has no recourse to deport them back to Italy. 
- If they do not register in any country it is impossible to know the route they used to get where they are.

If countries want to play hardball Italy can make it very difficult for other EU countries. They can issue transit visas at which point even the UK would have to accept them. The EU/UN tells Italy they must accept these people, they can't deport them or refuse them entry, but at the same time does nothing to accept any of the burden. The people our ships are picking up in the mediterranean aren't coming back to Britain, they're being dumped on Italian shores &amp; taken to refuge centres which they then escape from. They then travel overland to other countries &amp; register there for asylum. Even in the UK between 10 &amp; 40 people per day are crossing via Calais illegally so simply saying ""Italy needs to deal with this, it's their problem"" isn't a real solution.

I've had similar things. My favourite was two cunts who had stolen a quad and were driving it at me while I was cycling. I called them wankers and they wanted a fight - so I took the heavy chain bike lock from around my waist and started swinging. They fucked off fairly quick. Another was when I was 14 and got hit near my house by a guy in a group of seven - I went back with a golf club and they didn't want to fight anymore - because I told them I'd kill at least one of their number. One of them is dead now. He took his own life. Pickers did us all a favour to be honest.

Firmino is a much better finisher and better suited to play the second striker, or even a decent pure striker, while Coutinho is better at dropping deep and being a playmaker further away from the box than Firmino is. 

Both of them are deadly passer with great vision, really strong dribblers on the ball and pretty fast and athletic. Firmino would be an excellent fit in the style that brought us the most succes. I really hope this happens. If Sturridge ever gets back to his 13/14 season form, it would be a deadly front 3, even if Coutinho and Firmino would play wingers or at least a wider #10 role.

Interesting to see us go this route, maybe we're not satisfied with the available strikers to us, and have no interest in splashing big money and wages towards persuading players like Lacazette to join despite not being in the CL.

But this is all getting away from the point, even if no one crosses the mediterranean there are other places they can come from. You're never going to stop people crossing illegally &amp; you can't deport them back afterwards for reasons I've already outlined. This means we have to find a solutions to the following problems:

- Why people leave to begin with. It's not primarily for economic reasons, there is a massive spike right now &amp; it has nothing to do with economics.
- Where we can send them if we don't want to accept them ourselves. This solves the deportation issue. So we need agreements with other states. Perhaps we can bargain with them over aid. 

If we don't solve these two issues they're never going to stop coming here. I'm actually somewhat surprised Italy hasn't made a deal with another African state like he did with Ghadafi.

In short, we have no idea of knowing.

EDIT: Pulled up the info for you from a textbook: 

**Sprained ankle**


The commonest ankle injury of all, a sprained ankle, is a partial tear of the anterior inferior talofibular ligament caused by sudden adduction of the foot when the ankle is plantar-flexed. The patient is aware of pain at the time of injury, and on clinical examination there is tenderness over the ligament. There may be a haemarthrosis as well. 
Treatment. A firm elastic support is usually sufficient to relieve the pain but some patients need a below-knee cast. 
**The pain settles substantially after 10 days, but it will be uncomfortable for 8–12 weeks. The ankle may be painful if it is twisted accidentally for up to 2 years afterwards.**

**Lateral collateral ligament rupture**

The lateral malleolus may be avulsed and the fragment is sometimes substantial. 
Treatment. Fractures with no displacement can be treated conservatively in a below-knee cast. Dis- placed or unstable fragments will need internal fixation. Lateral collateral ligament rupture can occur without a fracture. The radiograph is normal but the diagno- sis can be made by the history, clinical examination and a stress radiograph to demonstrate abnormal mobility. 
Complications. Recurrent instability of the ankle can follow rupture of the lateral collateral ligament and may require a reconstructive procedure later (p. 431). 


**Avulsion of the lateral malleolus**

The lateral collateral ligament of the ankle is strong enough to avulse a fragment of the lateral malleolus. 
Treatment. The injury can be regarded as a severe sprain rather than a fracture of the fibula but pain can be so severe that a below-knee cast is needed. **If the fragment is more than 1 cm wide or displaced, it should be replaced and fixed.**

Sammi Hyppia hired as assistant / defensive coach.

In's: 

I'll work from back to front.

GK: 
Adrian from West Ham. We wouldn't get Lloris who would be perfect, but Adrian is the closest we could get in terms of a keeper that allows us to play a high line, positive, quick off his line, can sweep up with his feet, great reactions and is a bit mad in the greatest tradition of LFC keepers.

RB: 
Martin Montaya.


DM: 
Now that Khedira is gone.  Imbula from Marseille, or Illaramendi. Both about the same cost, I think Illara could be much better if given the starting place every week, but Imbula is a lower risk bet if maybe not the greater reward.


Forward: in order
Lacazette.  The real deal. He will be Ballon D'or material within 3 years.

Pedro: needs no introduction to Liverpool rumours or transfer links over the years. Anyone that can keep Sanchez out of a team pretty regularly deserves a shot in my XI.

Get those two and any left over cash could go on....

A lodger is not a protected form of tenant, they exist under contract between the 2 parties (landlord, lodger) and there is no real regulation surrounding this form of tenancy. To evict a lodger a landlord doesn't have to go through any formal legal process, they simply need to abide by the contract they signed (which can and often does require very little notice from the landlord, seeing requirements of a week notice from the landlord would not be surprising).

The notice you're talking about (""Notice of intention to seek possession by Landlord"") is a **Section 21** notice. These are *legal* notices that are required to start the process of terminating an **assured shorthold tenancy**, when these notices are involved that means the tenant has legal protections (a minimum of 2 months notice to leave, and even then an eviction can only take place if it is court ordered). Issuing a Section 21 notice at the start of a fixed term assured shorthold tenancy is fairly standard nowadays, it's not *nice* but it's not a big conspiracy by landlords to mess with tenants lives.

The bottom line is that if a landlord was accepting a tenant as a lodger they wouldn't need to issue a S21 notice because it has absolutely no relevance to lodging. You're either confusing a bunch of different things, or something has misinformed you.

Even when he played against us for however many minutes at the end he had some spark despite poor defending overall, he even took the ball from Benteke using pretty much just strength which is impressive.

I don't think he's amazing, yet, but for a 21 year old kid he has very good potential IMO and the right mentalities to be successful. We played Bacuna RB (Who I love but would rather see him at mid where he doesn't have to defend) in a relegation battle for our lives, Yedlin is like Bacuna on crack at least in all the RB aspects and he's still only 21. 

Tottenham I'm sure would be open to loaning him out to us even if he is not the first choice just to develop him since he's just been sitting on the bench there as 3rd or 4th pick. I think our style of play could work well with him and he could get some good assists assuming we hold onto Benteke for another season.

At the end of it all it's a good/potentially good player we can loan in at no real cost and if it doesn't work out, not a big deal. I think it would though.

E: As for the question about Lowton I overlooked, I don't think he's as good defensively yet, but I definitely think he's better offensively.

I honestly think that we would be better served utilizing the wings, or at least having wide midfielders.
Sherwood had us in that very centralized and narrow formation for the final few games, and look how they turned out....
If we're going to be riding the Benteke train, then we need to get the ball into the box without air balling it every time. While Bacuna can make some decent crosses, it becomes very predictable (the final Burnley game for example)
I feel like Sinclair has more than demonstrated enough quality to be in first team contention, and his pace and (from what i've seen) good positioning/vision could be very useful in getting the ball front and centre for Benteke to slam it in the back of the Net.

Blucher replied:

Wayre, 18th Jane 1815, at half past nine o'clock.

I request you will say to the Duke of Wellington, in my name, that even ill as I am, I shall, nevertheless, put myself at the head of my troops, for the purpose of immediately attacking the Enemy's Right Flank, should Napoleon undertake anything against the Duke.

Blücher.

The battle you're describing may have been the Battle of Wavre, a holding action fought, and eventually lost, by the Prussian III corps to prevent Grouchy's troops reaching Waterloo (whilst allowing the other 3 corps of their army to reach the battle). This didn't involve the troops which reached Waterloo, but played a vital role in facilitating Blucher's flank march and preventing Grouchy's forces from adding to the French numbers at Waterloo before it was too late.

As to the allies 'getting destroyed', they were holding on remarkably well against a force which was both more experienced (All of Napoleon's troops were veterans of at least one of his campaigns, only 7000 of the British troops were veterans of Wellington's peninsular campaign) and better equipped with both cavalry and cannon (The french had 5 guns for every 3 allied guns, and 3000 more cavalry, with a much higher proportion of heavy cavalry suited to use in a battle)

The allied forces were intended to be the anvil, the Prussians the hammer.

Imagine if our society were 10,000 people, one of whom was the banker and made up money so that he was the 50th richest person in the society without doing much. At this point, it's not fair, but it doesn't really matter. Now imagine that all 10,000 of us are bankers not doing anything but making up money. Obviously the society couldn't function. 

There is no mathematical answer to the exact number of bankers it would take to fuck up the system, but essentially, the more of them not doing anything, the weaker the system is. Moreover, when each person is not only failing to truly contribute, but is likely artificially inflating their own worth, (at the expense of those below them) then not only is the system weak, but also creates social problems between those who work hard for little pay and the bankers who are rich without truly enhancing the system. 

This is the state we are in now, and as the UK now gets a shocking ten percent of its GDP from finance, we have to ask 'what the hell does that ten percent represent?!' If it were ten percent from the auto industry, we would know that the mining, production and sales of those cars (as GDP only counts the final product) all represent something actually being made and benefitting ordinary people.

Unfortunately for him, that detachment failed in its objective, and the Prussians arrived at Waterloo at half past four that afternoon. They arrived on the French right flank, and immediately began rolling up the line. All Wellington had to do from that point was hold his position and let the Prussians do the hard work.

My dad's best advice ever is this: ""If you ever get in a bar fight tell the guy: ""we'll take this outside"". Let him lead the way. As you leave the bar pick up the first stool you see and shwach him over the head with it. Then just leave the bar alone."" 

My dad once bit a guy's Achillies heel [that muscle that makes your leg work] until it was useless because the guy and his mate were kicking the fuck out of him and he was on the ground and that leg was all he could grab on to. 

Bit it right out. The guy needed proper medical treatment, and then served a good long term in jail for assaulting a police officer..... A police officer who didn't pull his gun and shoot the cunt because he's cool as fuck. 

The most important things I've learned about fighting are these: ""Balls are easy to grab and crush""..... ""A human jaw can only take around 5 pounds of force.""

EDIT: a few more I've remembered: ""Put your hands up.... As if to surrender. Keep them in front of your face. When they swing, catch the punch with your hand and strike with the other."" Was taught to fight with both hands. 

""When in a confrontation and you can see the person's legs.... rake a shin with the outside of your foot. They will not expect that and shins are very sensitive. When they drop to hold the afflicted shin, grab them by the head and knee it repeatedly.""

""Never punch the person. Punch 5 inches behind the person.""

""This is a choke hold. You see how I'm choking you? Do that if you can. 

""Always try to punch a man's fist when he's punching at you. It'll hurt. But you'll hurt him too. He won't expect that. Follow up with a headbutt.

""Speaking of headbutts. Always grasp his neck with both hands before doing so. You'll knock him unconscious. But you'll be able to lay him down on the ground without hurting him further. He may have a spinal injury."" I have avery pronounced forehead. Like Easter Island territory. I wouldn't like to be hit with it. I agree with the sentiment. Glass skulls and all.

Admittedly it seems highly unlikely that United would sell to us, but it's clear he's out of favour and Van Gaal doesn't fancy him, very similar to the Welbeck situation; who expected him to go to Arsenal?

The fact is, this is a terrorist attack. We often don't consider attacks by racists as terrorism when they are (if we use the notion of political motivation as a guiding force in terrorism).

&gt;__Bananaman__ is a British [comic book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book) [fictional character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_character). Bananaman is a parody of traditional superheroes, being portrayed as a schoolboy who is transformed into a muscled, caped figure when he eats a banana. The character originally appeared in *[Nutty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutty)* as the backpage strip in [Issue 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_1), dated 16 February 1980 drawn by [John Geering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Geering). He has since appeared in *[The Dandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dandy)* and *[The Beano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beano)*.

Cech is a world class keeper and *will* win them points. And no one knows if we'll perform as good next season. Our signings might not work out/might suffer injuries (imagine hazard?)/long dip in form, whatever. Arsenal are a really good team, and if they didn't suffer so many injuries in the first half of the season, they would have finished a lot closer to us this season. At the end of the day, Cech's transfer *is* gonna make life difficult for chelsea and makes Arsenal a far bigger threat than they were. It *will* increase their chances a lot. Cech is a top 5 keeper in the world and many chelsea fans including myself still rate him over Courtois. 

When you *need* your keeper to make the big saves to keep you in the game and push you forward, Sczesny or Ospina aren't going to do that. Cech will. De Gea will and has done. Prime example would be his save against Crystal Palace near the end of the season. Little things like that make a big big difference. That one big save shifted the entire flow of the game into United's favour when everything was going against them. 

If it weren't for Lampard, our gap between City would have been by 9 more points. Imagine the difference Cech will make.

On top of that, he's not just going to any big club. He's going to bloody *Arsenal*. He's going to help **Arsenal** win the league.

Their war was mainly in Europe. That was the official US policy, [""Europe first""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe_first), at the end of the war there was almost twice the number of US divisions in Europe than the Pacific. 

America was instrumental in winning the war in Europe, not in a manpower or direct operational sense like the Soviets, but in their incredible industrial output. One of the reasons the Soviets were so successful later in the war was thanks to British and American lend-lease. Specifically over 400,000 trucks, over 2,000,000 tonnes of petroleum products and almost 2,000 trains. These logistical items were key to enabling the Soviet doctrine of deep battle to be used to full effect. 

The Americans were never allied with Britain before Pearl Harbor. There was never an alliance like that between Poland the UK and France. The United States was a neutral country and had been since the end of WW1. A democracy cannot just go to war with another country without the backing of the populace. Americans didn't want to go to war. 

That said Roosevelt had slowly been supplying the UK with arms, supplies and ships, at first with the ""cash and carry"" and destroyers for bases program and then, in March 1941 (nine months before the US entry into the war) with an actual lend-lease program. I don't think selling large numbers of supplies, weapons and ships for low prices really counts as exploitation, especially considering the US never even considered selling anything to Germany. 

The Americans contributed more manpower in Europe than the British and French. The Americans provided more weapons, equipment, aircraft, ships, trucks etc. than France or the UK. The Americans were in the war far longer than the French, who essentially stopped being a nation state in 1940. Yes there was the French resistance but that was heavily supplied by the British and US and couldn't hope to have anywhere near the impact of a whole nation. 

Not even going to go into the atomic bombs. It probably saved more lives as an invasion of Japan would have been horrific, American dead alone were projected at half a million. The impact on the Japanese, both military and civilian, would have been far far worse. 

I hate this new form of bad history that tries to downplay the American efforts in the war. WW2 was a joint effort between a huge number of countries. Without the US, British or Soviets especially the war would have had a totally different course. It's outrageous to say the Americans didn't help much in WW2.

null,false,baycitytroller,cnty-scotland,Shang a lang,null,"&gt;SCOTLAND'S leading charity for blind and partially-sighted people has been plunged into crisis over an apparent take-over by an English counterpart.
&gt;
&gt;The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) is planning to transfer staff and services from Scotland to the organisation that runs its services south of the Border.
&gt;
&gt;The plan has left many fearing that its work and fundraising will be undermined.
&gt;
&gt;The group's Action for Blind People (ABP), which currently runs all the charity's services in England, is to take over the operations in a bid to triple the number of people the charity reaches.
&gt;
&gt;However, staff in Scotland say there has been no explanation of how the strategy will work or evidence provided that it will benefit the 180,000 Scots with vision problems who currently receive help.
&gt;
&gt;Unison's voluntary sector organiser for Scotland Deborah Dyer said: ""There is a complete lack of transparency about the business rationale for this move, what it will mean for the general public or how it will be of any benefit to service users. People are utterly baffled about what is going on.""
&gt;
&gt;The move also impacts on the charity's operations in Wales and Northern Ireland.
&gt;
&gt;A total of 468 staff in the three countries will be affected by the move.
&gt;
&gt;Although registered as a charity in Scotland, ABP does not currently operate north of the border. The RNIB, which was founded in the UK in 1868, will continue in name only in Scotland, raising questions about the transparency of seeking donations and funding under the RNIB Scotland brand.
&gt;
&gt;All of the charity's services in England are already delivered by ABP, which is part of the UK-wide group. The group says this means the plans do not represent a take-over.
&gt;
&gt;But the RNIB Group acknowledged many of the concerns in response to a fractious internal consultation exercise earlier this year, which laid bare the fears of some of the charity's Scottish staff.
&gt;
&gt;An internal document passed to The Herald appears to concede that country chairs from all three home nations, including Sandra Wilson, recently appointed chairwoman of RNIB Scotland, voted against the transfer. However, the boards of trustees from RNIB Charity, ABP and RNIB group all backed it.
&gt;
&gt;The first step in a major Customer Change Programme will see the Scottish teams transferred as ""a business unit"" to ABP, the information for staff states, with terms and conditions unchanged for the moment.
&gt;
&gt;The charities are not seeking cost savings and no Scottish services will cease, the document says.
&gt;
However, unease among staff is clear from the questions the document fields, for example one apparent suggestion from workers that RNIB Scotland remain part of a larger group alongside ABP and the Northern Irish and Welsh branches: ""[this would be] Simple transparent and honest - something the new proposals are not"".
&gt;
&gt;This option was considered and rejected, the document records.
&gt;
&gt;Staff are also concerned that they will be presented to the public as RNIB Scotland, even though they are employed by another charity. However, the group said the ""Scotland brand is a valuable asset to our group of charities"".
&gt;
&gt;There are also questions over whether the Scottish Government, or the public, will be happy funding an English-based charity.
&gt;
&gt;The group insists the Scotland brand can still be retained, while being transparent about the new arrangement.
&gt;
&gt;Questions are also addressed about ABP's lack of experience in running education services and a lack of consultation with RNIB members or ""customers"" about the shake-up.
&gt;
&gt;The document says: ""Our approach is to consult our members on strategy, policies and services, not operational issues.""
&gt;
&gt;Staff members have objected that no detailed risk analysis has been carried out: ""This is highly irresponsible and sadly blind and partially-sighted people in Scotland will be the ones who pay the price.""
&gt;
&gt;In response, the company said: ""We believe the risks are manageable.""
&gt;
&gt;Another issue causing concern is the fact that RNIB Scotland is unionised, but ABP, which will employ staff once they are transferred on Tuesday, September 1, is not.
&gt;
&gt;The group says it is in discussions about this agreement with Unison and Unite unions. However, trade union Unison said it was seriously concerned over the ""unjustified"" transfer.
&gt;
&gt;National officer Simon Watson said staff had not been kept informed, adding that ""very little has been done to reassure them"".
&gt;
&gt;He added: ""Staff and service users feel very uncertain over the long-term future of the service and their jobs. RNIB is yet to give a convincing explanation for such huge changes.""
&gt;
&gt;A spokesman for RNIB Scotland said: ""The RNIB Group of charities are currently looking how we are set up across the UK so we can reach many more people living with sight loss.
&gt;
&gt;""Detailed consultation on proposals concluded last week and we are currently analysing the feedback.
&gt;
&gt;""This is part of an ongoing dialogue with staff and trustees on how we can best deliver more for more people,"" he added.

Maybe the community's learned not to post them here, maybe the mods are better at filtering them out, or maybe enough time since the source material that those sort of posts are based on has passed that they don't have the popularity they did anymore, who knows? 

They did genuinely used to be a problem. The fact about reddit is that people generally only vote on what they consume. Pictures are easily accessed, thus they are consumed quicker and voted on more, so they are voted on more and rise to the top easier. I'm not saying this is good or bad, I'm merely stating a fact. The banned items in rule 4 are almost all *pretty specific* categories of pictures. Those categories are all *very* easy to generate, and their relationship to the show is tenuous at best.

I pointed those examples out specifically because they were particularly egregious offenders. At the time people must have figured out that they could get tons of karma for, say, simply writing ""Bad Wolf"" on a thing, or taking a picture of a crack, etc. I can only assume seeing so many of them score so high only encouraged people to post more of them. 

The points don't matter to me. The fact that each of these posts would easily park themselves on the front page for 2,3,4 days at a time made them bad, especially since they would often take up the majority of the first couple pages. The sheer volume of them drowned out  most other categories of posts. Say what you want about the place now, but at least we're getting some *variety* in our posts. I don't care much for the cakes either, but at least there's actually discussion about the show, articles, news, things that people wouldn't have bothered to post or if they did, would be buried under dozens of pictures of things like statues, tally marks, and tumblr gifs.


&gt;How do you feel about items about cast and production team in non-DW contexts?

I'm not against them personally, I think it falls under the umbrella of ""news"" for the most part.  I do see where the mods were getting at with that rule though. I think it's slightly heavy handed in its application, but I think it's a reasonable standard to have posts in a subreddit about the show be directly about the show.

Also in response to your other post about that article being pulled, I think you're taking it a bit too personally. Come on man, it was a *second hand tabloid article.* That would have probably been pulled from lots of other subreddits, not just this one.

null,false,xtremity,null,null,null,"The UK model is pretty bad.  It consists of copyright holders obtaining a High Court order against specific ISPs to block specific websites.  This means that it's (currently) a highly pinpointed approach.  Perhaps due to the fact that large corporations, and the courts, move quite slowly, they only target the largest ISPs and the most notorious websites.  This means if you're on smaller ISP you probably aren't even aware of the blocks and if you're unlucky enough to be affected a simple VPN, proxy or even TOR will bypass the 'block'.

The whole process is fairly transparent, which means ISPs [publish lists](http://help.sky.com/articles/websites-blocked-under-order-of-the-high-court) of the sites they block.  This can serve to point would copyright infringers towards the very sites these mega corporations don't want you to know about.  

There is [some evidence](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/10/blocking-copyright-infringing-websites-derided-whacking-moles) that the block does very little to combat copyright infringement, as shutting down one site tends to lead to increased competition among websites and the so-called ""Hydra"" effect, where file sharers simply move to multiple, smaller resources to get content, rather than sticking with one service.  This more fragmented structure is potentially harder to attack in the long term.

With a Conservative government in power, the main concern is that they will implement wide ranging, Orwellian Internet censorship measures.

That's not how a job as you put it works, you leave your employment and you owe nothing to your previous employers you can go to a nearby rival competitor in any business.

I'm saying if when he remains here its just a job and he needs to respect us fans and the club at a level to the extent he would jepradise his time with family or play at a lower level club than he simply deserves to play at , a level of respect you simply do not hold for him is just ridiculous.

WW2 was a joint effort between a huge number of countries. Without the US, British or Soviets especially the war would have had a totally different course. It's outrageous to say the Americans didn't help much in WW2.""

It's come about as a counter to American media. Nobody should play down the role America played but you often see bollocks like 'The US was one fighting Japan' ignoring China and the British/Indian/Australian etc efforts there literally having the biggest battles man power wise. Then there's comments of the entire of the lease thing being American ignoring tat somehow the Empire/commonwealth bankrupted itself somehow but not seeing the part American financing had to play in it. 

Yes it was at greatly reduced rates but if you look at the start of the war and the private borrowing of the British government then yeah it was simply war profiteering, they wanted us to win no doubt but some of the interest rates are just crazy looking at the financial situation.

I find the British side of the war downplayed to a massive extent tbh, you'll find all sorts of stuff and about land lease and American Industrial output along with Soviet causality figures. But I guess this is getting away from your point and without a doubt without the US things would be very different... imagine having to use conscription in India to beat the Japanese.

That's a bit disingenuous, possibly misleading - you're skipping over the fact that 'all' Wellington had to do up to the point the Prussians turned up (late, BTW) was hold the line against against one of the greatest generals in Europe, who commanded a force superior in both numbers and experience. You also seem to imply that the Prussians actually did the important fighting and dismiss the defeat of the old guard by the British as incidental, when it was actually one of the pivotal points of the engagement.



Let's be clear, the Prussians turning up sealed the deal and turned the tide  - is not unfair to say that it's highly unlikely that there would have been a victory without them, but their actual contribution to the fighting itself was essentially a) leading a chunk of Napoleon's forces on a wild goose chase east of the battle field (though this was more due to some baffling decisions by the French officers and written orders from boney) and b) increasing the confusion and later panic in the French ranks, ultimately turning the defeat from a retreat to a rout and capturing Napoleon in the process.

He rested players at wrong times, his substitutions and other decisions were something that Arsenal fans complained *a ton* about earlier in the season.

You get instructions on how to proceed – like no touching or no conversations. Some people bring small props or may ask for a special pose or for a group picture with family or friends. Special requests may or may not be accommodated.

It went pretty quick – stand with the actor(s) – photo gets taken – collect it on the way out. It was well organized and there was no time to get flustered. I saw some people get star struck when asking questions at the actor panels but I didn’t really see it happen to anyone during the photo session. I went into it thinking about trying to look cool (or at least not un-cool) but I only had time to worry about not blinking.

Depending on when your photo session is scheduled you may be able to take the photo back for an autograph session. Also worth the cost. If you want an autograph and schedules don’t work out then you’ll have to use a provided stock photo.

Don’t know if it’s available there but I sprang for the VIP ticket which included the Pond Family actor panels, the short line for all panels, and photo and autograph sessions. Not cheap but absolutely worth it.

The year is 1790.  New York is the capital of the USA.  It is proposed to move it to Washington DC.  Just like in England today, people plan to move the capital from a large cultural centre to a smaller, less prominent, city (in the case of Washington DC, one that hadn't yet been built).

You object that Washington DC is ""not a global city to the extent London is"".  That's irrelevant.  The correct comparison is New York, which **is** a global city comparable to London.

You object that ""trying to turn a place like Manchester into London is doomed to fail"".  That's probably true, but also irrelevant.  You don't need to ""turn Manchester into London"" in order to move Parliament and the government there -- any more than you had to ""turn Washington DC into New York"" in order to move the US federal government there.

If Manchester became the capital of the UK, would that mean Parliament and government would be moving to a smaller, less culturally important city?  Yes.

That's a very naive and basic look on gendered clothing.

Modern dresses may have developed how they are today partly to accentuate form but don't think for one minute that they aren't all based on rigid gender roles defining who can where what. 

Throughout history plenty of gendered clothing has done nothing to accentuate the form but they still existed, how do you account for those?

The notion that dresses only look *good* on women exist not because ""they just do that's biology"" but as a form and continuation of what women and men can and cannot do. Men can look good in dresses, women can look good in suits.

Many women were scorned for not wearing feminine clothing and plenty of men claimed it was because they didn't look good in suits, you'd have to be very gullible to believe this was the case.",null,0,null,1435042353,null,0,false,0,csfo32m,null,t3_3aqx0g,null,t1_csfo32m,null,t1_csfnzmk,null,null,null,1437277816,null,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18,null

There are no rules in gendered clothing dress codes that say ""all your clothes must be well tailored"" so your entire argument is irrelevant to begin with as that isn't what it's about.

I'm not sure if you understand what's being discussed.

&gt; There's a reason style developed like that - it looks good. If you want to throw hundreds of years of fashion/style/caution to the wind

Style is constantly changing, would you also complain that we don't dress in Gregorian frilly lace?

So realistically we would spend £24-27m on all 3 players, which ok business. Clyne is the only one that really is decent value and even then there's better value around Europe for £15m IMO. There's Caravajal, Montoya, De Sciglio, and possibly Aurier all available for the same or less money.

Given that each well requires this, and that the nature of the drilling requires that a large number of holes be drilled it's a significant increase in traffic volume.  Now, while it's arguably not direcly linked to the process of fracking itself, it's still something which is going to be an associated cost to the nearby community and is worth looking at.

The surveillance dossiers can be referenced and read whenever someone is flagged up as a ""person of interest"", e.g. if they attend an anti-government protest (such as the recent 100,000 strong anti austerity protest in London) or is active in their dissent of main government policies via their communications or social media activity. E.G. if they actively post against ""austerity"", Mass Surveillance, the Neocon wars, government corruption, Corporate Welfare, or currently the massive Corporate Power Grab TTIP, TISA and TPP ""free trade"" deals etc. So pretty much anything that puts the government in a bad light, calls out one of their lies, or otherwise might reduce their credibility or reputation to the public at large.

In the UK the ""Snooper's Charter"" is designed to legalize all the Mass Data collection on everyone, that the recent USA ""Freedom"" Act is designed to do in the States.

#Snowden's achievements and the USA Freedom Act

The USA Freedom Act is NOT to protect America from terrorists - It's to protect the corrupt government FROM outraged Americans.

The USA Freedom Act legalizes the Mass Data Collection and hence Mass Surveillance on everything by everyone (which was recently ruled illegal under the Patriot Act).

The USA Freedom Act, like the Patriot Act, has nothing whatsoever to do with ""Counter Terrorism"" - it's for domestic political control by setting up surveillance dossiers on everyone on everything they do. The surveillance dossiers can then be used to harass, intimidate, blackmail or jail anyone the government doesn't like or wants to control.
Even the NSA has admitted that the Patriot Act has stopped zero terrorist plots since it was passed in 2001.

The USA Freedom Act is the Bill that Keith Alexander and the NSA wanted (as opposed to the Patriot Act) but didn't think they would be able to get through Congress.

The only things that Snowden has achieved are :

Congress legalizing Mass Data Collection (which the Patriot Act failed to do) and thus unlimited spying on everyone, on everything all the time for domestic political control with the passing of the USA ""Freedom"" Act.

Letting the entire population know that everyone is being spied on, on everything, all the time. (This was known many years previously to people who researched the subject, principally via the revelations of William Binney, but also by other whistle blowers and researchers like James Bamford, Thomas Drake and Russ Tice).

Getting the population to accept Mass Data Collection and the setting up of a Mass Surveillance State (as existed in East Germany with the Stasi) with barely a murmur. Zero protests were seen against passing the USA ""Freedom"" Act in the US, the UK or anywhere else.

The terrorist threat has been deliberately manufactured and exacerbated by US Foreign Policy actions, to enable draconian Police State laws like the ""Freedom"" Act to be passed and to massively increase arms company profits - it's a giant scam http://ian56.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-terrorist-threat-has-been.html

Summary

What is the point of setting up a system of intimidation, if people don't know they are being intimidated? Everyone in East Germany knew the Stasi were spying on everyone - the Stasi didn't keep it a secret.

The Mafia much prefer warning business owners that their business will get burned down if they don't pony up the Protection Money, rather than actually burning places down. Rare public demonstrations that they are not joking around are carried out as examples - see e.g. Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden.

It's far easier to dissuade large numbers of people from active dissent than it is to round them them all up afterwards.

The Panopticon effect https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon

Everybody knows they are watching and can see everything, but they are not sure who they are looking at, right this minute.

So everybody behaves as if they are being watched by the government, every minute of every day (at least that's what the government hopes to achieve by Mass Surveillance).

In hindsight we can see that they weren't great signings, but at the start of last season we were all very happy with the transfer window. Balotelli wasn't nearly as bad he is now, MANY of us were saying he would be worth the 16 million gamble. Lambert was coming off a very good season with Southampton and were excited to have him. We made 10 signings and I really thought we had done well enough to challenge again for the title, but we did not. 

Not saying I think our signings will be like they were last season, I think we've done well so far in this window, and we can probably make more advances once Sterling if off, but who is to say that Bacca or Rondon (which I believe are just rumours) will be better than Balotelli? I don't know enough about Bacca to comment on him, but Rondon has only really had one good season, which was the last one. Firmino also rarely plays as a striker, so if we fail to sign another striker (assuming we're getting him) then I doubt we would exceed any expectations. 

I may sound pessimistic, but I'm not going to raise my hopes as high as I did last season after the end of the transfer window. There was far too much pain involved for the amount of emotion we put into this football club. I hope that all the signings we make exceed every expectation and we get top 4, but I wouldn't get incredibly excited just yet. 

Edit: Regardless of who our striker was last season we still finished 6th and 8 points from 4th after spending 100 million in the market. At the time we thought it was a very good 100+ million spent, so it wasn't that good of a finish. We shouldn't have to settle for ""We didn't do too bad"", after spending that kind of money.

I'm in no way saying Lallana is a bad player, i'm just saying that he doesn't belong in the starting 11 of a team that wins the Premier League, but he is still integral to have in a team. Dirk Kuyt probably didn't belong in the starting 11, neither did the Scums Ji Sung Park, but those players are incredibly important too. Haven't watched him play for England as much though.

Mdiddy makes a good point about the price, but I just maintain that the price was the price, and for that price Adam Lallana wasn't a particularly good purchase, especially considering his age. Fuck it, now he's here and can contribute, IMO just not as a starter. Getting a player like Firmino is exactly what we need in terms of strenghtening the starting 11 with a new player, and bettering the depth by pushing Lallana to the bench. No more buying bench players or developmental guys who might succeed 1,2 or 3 years down the line. No more Ings, Borini, Lambert. 

His biggest problem seems to be consistency, and not just because of injuries. However he probably singlehandly won us the game in which he scored his first goal, WBA at Anfield perhaps? If he can find a level similarly to that game, especially if the can do it coming from the bench or without having played the former 3 games for the full 90 minutes, he is exactly the player to step in when we need to change our style or need to rest Coutinho after a european game and we're visiting Hull or Palace who'll be deep and physical. He still need to be quicker on the ball and in his passes, because he doesnt have the same quickness as Coutinho, and no where near the pure speed of Sterling or Ibe. I've also been kinda disappointed about his finishing which didn't look like it did for Southhampton, but i'll put that on his injuries and him not getting his final touch locked down.

What I find curious is that the sisters and children left to Medina without an adult male to accompany them on their pilgrimage.  It would be good to know if the husbands have already been there because that might explain why they did not go too.  If the husbands have not done their pilgrimage, yet allowed children to go in their place, I believe it would mean that the women were fundamentalist Muslims while the husbands were not--ergo, a major marital issue.  What would be normal to a fundamentalist would not be a western way of life.  Syria might be where the sisters want to be.

What is also missing from the picture is the position of the 3rd husband who is currently in Pakistan.  Why did he not join in the allegations of the other two husbands?  There is another story here.

I have not followed the story but have the impression that when entire families leave husbands behind in another country, those marriages were not solid.

No cables, no clogging, super easy to push if you get a self propelled one (worth it).

They need a bit of maintenance, but it is quick and simple, my lawn mower started first time after being in the shed for 6 months over winter - because I stored it properly.

Before storing do this and you will never have any problems...

1. Run it for a few mins to warm the engine (warm not hot).

2. Drain the fuel (put it in your car or bin it - it will not keep well over winter - this is a common mistake).

3. Drain the oil

4. Put new oil in (my mover uses synthetic 5W30 - so cheap car stuff ~ £5 a change).

5. Start the mover and run until it stops- this drains the fuel lines and works the now oil through.

6. Store it.

When you get it out next year just brush off the air filter, fill it up and it will start perfectly.
Change the sparks every 3 years or so.

I'll make the same point about Origi that I made when we signed Markovic. Origi literally just turned 20 years old, just joined a new team and has never played in the Premier League. You absolutely cannot count on him performing this season, thats just incredibly unfair to a young player getting used to new surroundings, and apparently had a pretty shitty season for Lille. Everything he does this season should be considered a bonus, just like Ibe's, Can's and Markovic' performances this season should. Not even Eden Hazard, who with Neymar just might have been the biggest fucking talent in the world when he signed for Chelsea, didn't perform straight away with any sort of consistency. He was still very good, of course he is Eden Hazard. Do not put that pressure on Origi.

I'm personally done expecting anything from Daniel Sturridge, at least until he proves me otherwise. The guy is just too injured and apparently he is out until October this time. I consider every game Studge is healthy as a bonus where he can support the hopefully great striker we'll sign this window. When he is healthy we'll have one of the great fronts and when he is not we're not counting on him, and the season he is healthy for the majority of the year, thats the season we'll get something special again. Studge is a great striker, despite a weak season this year when he played, and he might be my favorite LFC player right now because he is so funny and relatable. He is just so damn injury prone, you can't expect anything from him sadly.

The great hall was usually off-limits for the day as well as the headmasters corridor. They let our own CCF basically stand guard on the doors to stop students and such, as well as put into place barriers around the carpark. 

Don't recall any snipers on the roofs or sniffer dogs at any of the visits.

*N.B* We had the French President and John Kerry visit near my work space for the signing of the Iranian nuclear treaty a few months ago. There was far more security, snipers, armed guards, armoured vehicles, road blocks etc.

Addition: I was at Windsor Castle for a ceremony which the Queen presided over. The security was far less overt than I had expected. Our cars were searched and our electronic devices removes, but we weren't scanned or patted down.

Personally I'm undecided on the EU, from my perspective it may be the wrong time to leave considering it would only strengthen the right-wing of British politics and allow them to further smash workers, but the EU is undemocratic, so how can it be reformed?

 It is still a neoliberal organisation which actively promotes privitisation and undermines workers, so leaving may do the UK more harm right now, but when would we get the opportunity again? If Cameron brings back no 'ever closer political union' I'll vote to stay in.

null,false,NEWSBOT3,cnty-uk,Londontown,null,"&gt; At the peak of the recession, there were hundreds of people chasing jobs in some industries across the UK.

&gt;But as the economy has improved, so has the nation’s job prospects. Graduate recruitment at Britain’s top employers is set to reach its highest level for more than a decade this year, and the median starting salary at the country’s leading employers will increase to £30,000 for this year’s graduates.
&gt;But it’s not just graduates who are having better luck. It's estimated that almost 40pc of all workers are keeping an eye out for other job opportunities this year, as they feel more confident about either changing careers or finding better roles elsewhere. The UK’s unemployment rate dropped by 35,000 in the three months to March to 1.83m, the lowest level for seven years. A record 31.1m people are in work, and the jobless rate has fallen to 5.5pc.
&gt;But if you’re thinking about a new job or fancy a career change, which sectors should you be looking at? Here’s what the experts say.


&gt;**Information Technology**


&gt;Technology is fast-moving with plenty of chances of promotion, and demand for IT professionals is surging. Graduates with strong Java knowledge, or Java developers with one to two years’ experience, can now demand an annual salary of £35,000 - a year ago they were looking at salaries of £28,000. Java, a programming language widely used by interactive websites, is frequently cited as the most searched-for skill keyword from employers. A decade ago, smartphones and tablets didn’t even exist, and many companies are still getting to grips with where they should be chanelling their digital efforts.
&gt;There were 105,760 jobs advertised in the IT sector in February 2015, jobs listing website Adzuna says, a rise of 6pc in six months. More than 13,300 of those required Java skills.
&gt;Web developers in general are looking at an average advertised salary of £39,141.


&gt;**Healthcare, medical and nursing**



&gt;Nurses are always in high demand in the UK, and specialist nurses working in operating theatres and neonatal intensive care units are listed on the Government's Shortage Occupations List. Recent figures from the health service suggested that one-in-five new nurses in hospitals comes from abroad. Spain, Portugal and the Philippines were the most popular countries to recruit nurses from. Staff nurses earn around £22,000 a year but this rises with experience, and salaries at the most senior level can reach almost £100,000.
&gt;There were 97,359 healthcare vacancies listed on Adzuna in February.


&gt;**Engineering**

&gt;There are many branches of engineering, from working in aerospace and transport to road and bridge maintenance. However, the UK is facing a chronic skills shortage in the sector and engineers are in high demand. Sir James Dyson, one of the UK's leading entrepreneurs, regularly bemoans the shortage of engineers in Britain. He recently donated £12m to set up The Dyson School of Design Engineering, based in South Kensington, to tackle the crisis.
&gt;There were 90,080 engineering jobs listed on Adzuna in February. The Office for National Statistics calculated the median wage for engineering professionals to be £29,700 in 2011.


&gt;**Accountancy and finance**


&gt;Being a qualified accountant is one of the most useful skills when it comes to long-term career planning. There is growing demand for accountants, and a number of employers are looking to hire graduates into part-qualified positions to cover a shortage in candidates, says recruitment firm Hays. Being an accountant means less exposure to economic peaks and troughs than careers in sales and business development, for example. Most graduates going into accountancy will train as chartered accountants. Even if people change their minds about becoming an accountant, the skills can be transferred to a wide range of industries and businesses, including law and advertising.
&gt;In February, there were 85,780 accountancy and finance vacancies listed on Adzuna, a rise of 11pc in six months.

&gt;**Construction &amp; Property**

&gt;The construction industry suffered heavily during the recession as housebuilding and major development projects stalled. However, building activity has risen over the past couple of years, boosted by a strong property market in the UK. Salaries for some construction professionals have risen by more than 10pc in the past year, says Hays.
&gt;Quantity surveyors and estimators are receiving the highest increases within this sector, showing a clear demand for more people, the agency added. The construction sector accounts for about 6pc of the UK economy, and things are looking brighter in the sector than at any point since 2007. Last year was the best year for British builders in almost 20 years. And with experienced professionals in short supply, graduate-level opportunities are also on the rise.

&gt;Adzuna says that advertised vacancies in the construction sector surged to 50,007 in March, compared to 39,412 in March 2014.
&gt;Average advertised salaries rose to £38,971 in March 2015, compared to £33,889 the same time a year ago.


&gt;**Human Resources**


&gt;As unemployment falls, there is growing demand for HR and recruitment professionals to handle job applications and hunt for new recruits. To work in HR, you need to enjoy interacting with people, as you’re likely to be handling internal requests and questions from outsiders keen to join the company. Average salaries are around £29,910, but can rise much higher depending on experience and which industry you work in.
&gt;There were 28,909 HR roles advertised on Adzuna in February this year, up from 16,989 in February 2013.


&gt;**Marketing**


&gt;Marketing was severely affected by the economic downturn but opportunities are increasing as the UK's economic recovery picks up pace. Salaries in the sector can range from a starting base of £18,000, but can go beyond £100,000 for the top roles. Marketing managers typically earn around £47,000 a year.
&gt;Marketing is a flexible job, and allows people to work in almost any industry sector, from financial services and consumer goods, to motor and technology. A key part of the role is to understand current and potential customer behaviour, as well as to develop the marketing plan for a product or brand.
&gt;There were 23,386 marketing roles listed on Adzuna in February, a 75pc increase from the 13,358 listed two years ago.",null,0,null,1435051005,null,0,false,0,csfqa3z,null,t3_3at77h,null,t1_csfqa3z,null,t1_csfq3kq,null,null,null,1437279446,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

So not all projects funded actually met the so - called strict criteria; lots of projects were funded in political ridings where the Conservatives needed votes; and lots of funds were held back to coincide with approval announcements at election time.

The UK Government is following a doctrine of rolling back the state and leaving people to their own devices more.

Classical social welfare states are high tax and large public sector entities where people pay more of their earnings in taxes to fund an expansive government that operates many poor relief schemes such as subsidised housing, tax breaks and benefit allowances so that those on the lowest end of the scale are given a lift up by this.

The current UK Government plan is less tax and less government and encouraging people to be self sufficient or to rely on each other. Food banks, for example, are an intentional part of what David Cameron called ""Big Society"": don't look to the government to put food on your plate if you can't do it yourself, look instead to charitable efforts by your fellow citizens.

To say we can't afford to do this is wrong, we absolutely can. Consider that the Government at the moment isn't **only** cutting spending, they're also cutting taxes. ""Eliminate the deficit"" is just the slogan they're using to front it all: you don't cut taxes if you're trying to lower the deficit, after all.

What do you define as 'truly contributing'? Why is someone who digs up a potato and sells it at market price contributing more to the economy than a banker who sells his skills at market price?

Both are taxed. Both are paid for their work. There are tangible benefits from the work done by both. If there weren't; nobody would pay them for their work.

I really don't understand the 'you have to produce something physical to be of value to society' thing you've got going.

&gt;If it were ten percent from the auto industry, we would know that the mining, production and sales of those cars (as GDP only counts the final product) all represent something actually being made and benefitting ordinary people. 

Why is selling someone a car for profit a better contribution to society than selling someone financial services for profit? People choose to pay for both and both parties benefit in each case.

That's what Labour massively did and we can either kick the can down the road so that future generations can deal with it, or we can take action now to reduce spending and bring the deficit under control.

All parties are signed up to this, even the SNP although they do well to cloak their commitment to austerity behind cleverly worded statements about AME and DELs.

&gt; Surely those that caused the crash, employees of the financial sectors on eye watering wages, are better equipped to keep the NHS afloat in these times of austerity?

Well you can ask France if those policies work.

There simply aren't enough mansions to tax or enough millionaires to squeeze if we want to spend the same amount of money as Labour did.

That being said, the richest do pay more tax under the Conservatives than they have done in the past, so its inaccurate to say that they aren't also shouldering the burden.

&gt; I'm not particularly concerned about the ""squeezed middle"", it's those that rely on benefits to keep them above the breadline that I care about.

The problem that the left has today, and why we are seeing left wing governments losing power across Europe is this:

What will you do when you run out of other people's money to spend?

You can either have some miracle formula for growing the economy without cutting spending, or you can reign in public spending until you get things under control.

The idea that you should draw the line at something as silly as this just seems ridiculous to me. Dogs and pigs suffer the same when being killed as their brains are pretty similar.

Why should their culture have to change because of the way the people in the west have of dogs? It doesn't address the problem if anything it makes the cruelty worse because it means that they have to operate further and further underground in order to do so. Likewise Jews and Muslims refuse to eat pork so why should they force people who don't follow their religion to do the same? 

I feel the reason that the horse meat scandal was such a big deal was because it was people have this stupid notion about horses not that people were being lied to. This is despite the fact most people couldn't realistically keep horses. I want to eat horse. Why should I be stopped from doing so.

 As others have said, a car is a definite necessity. I live a few miles from a popular but small town with cities within a 40 minute drive so we are not too disconnected. Nearly all the things and activities that you spend time doing in the city, you can find locally (albeit usually on a smaller scale), but you will usually need to drive...

You will also find that unless you are willing to shell out for expensive taxis, socialising in the pub does mean you/your partner having to drive and so much more socialising at friend's houses. Workwise, commuting to the nearest city/local town is much quicker than the average london commute!

What I love being in the countryside, is having the fields surrounding the house and waking up and hearing the diverse birdsong. I only realised how noisy the city was/is on going back to visit. The people are generally much more cheery and upbeat, and the neighbourhood ""spirit"" often portrayed in the media, I find quite true for village life!

Why is it silly to draw the line there?  It's not an arbitrary line, dogs and cats have been specifically bred to be human companions.  Cows and chickens haven't. Dogs can be members of a family group (in their eyes) that includes humans.  Yes, everything suffers when it dies; the level of suffering isn't really the point (although I'd argue that a dog is much more likely to know what's coming a lot earlier than a chicken or cow does).

&gt;The chimpanzee and orang-untan argument is a false equivalent as there are not that many left so is not a sustainable soruce.

You've deliberately engineered the false equivalence here to avoid answering the intended question.  The question was one of an empathetic connection to the animals.  Imagine chimps aren't endangered, or pick a monkey closely related to humans that isn't.  Do you still think it's acceptable to kill and eat them when it's not absolutely crucial to your survival? Is it OK to have meat festivals for those monkeys?

People don't like to kill creatures that give them companionship and protection; or in a wider sense, animals that they basically feel related to.  

&gt;Why should their culture have to change because of the way the people in the west have of dogs?

I don't think anyone would seriously argue that we should go over there guns blazing and try and change their culture.  We're all perfectly entitled to think that they're wankers though.

null,false,TheBeastOfBuckhaven,null,null,null,"""we can either kick the can down the road so that future generations can deal with it, or we can take action now to reduce spending and bring the deficit under control""

OK, but why is the reduction in spending aimed at benefits that represent a lifeline to many? There are many other areas in which we could reduce spending first: MP pay, Lords expenses, quango culls, defence cuts (Trident), vanity projects such as HS2 etc. while the gap can be plugged with new Land Value and, as you say, Mansion Taxes to rebalance some of the wealth inequality in the country while keeping the coffers filled.

""There simply aren't enough mansions to tax or enough millionaires to squeeze if we want to spend the same amount of money as Labour did.""

I don't agree with that. Some simple changes to our tax law would close the loopholes that celebrities like Jimmy Carr and Gary Barlow exploited and see the tax take in this country effectively increase overnight.

""The problem that the left has today, and why we are seeing left wing governments losing power across Europe is this:
What will you do when you run out of other people's money to spend?""

I take a different view. I believe that the rise of right wing governments (not applicable everywhere but certainly here) is down to people looking for someone to blame for the economic downturn. The Tories have won big by scapegoating and artificially inflating the fears of scroungers and benefit cheats to the horror of those who are working hard for less than they've ever got. I'm not saying there are no scroungers out there but they don't exist in the numbers that we're expected to believe.

I'm not saying that all cuts are unavoidable, I just feel strongly that the axe is falling in the wrong place.

Depended who it was - if it was just Prince Andrew having a meeting with the Directors about UK exports or something then he more or less just pitches up with his escort. They might send a bomb dog around, but the main thing is they just don't tell anyone he's coming on what is essentially a business trip. Most of the people in the building wouldn't even know he'd been there till he'd left.

For the Queen's visit, Police would arrive a few days before, walk the route she was going to take and risk assess. Any doors onto the route would have guards on them. Any doors into closed areas - offices or cupboards (i.e. that don't lead anywhere) would have a security seal taped over after they'd been swept, so the roving patrols could easily see that no one had been in.

That was quite a big gig as they go because it's a big factory spread over several acres with a few thousand people on site, and they'd just won a big award so it was one of those big visits where she saw everything and it ended up on the 6o'clock news. Sweeping and screening a primary school will be much quicker and easier - smaller site, fewer rooms to sweep, fewer exit/access points to secure (and an absence of welding robots and hazardous industrial machinery!).

Likewise, lower profile visits by Charles or something might be restricted to certain office areas or one end of the factory floor so they can sweep and secure it fairly easily.",null,0,null,1435057889,null,0,1435058298,0,csfrvfe,null,t3_3ash6m,null,t1_csfrvfe,null,t3_3ash6m,null,null,null,1437280774,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

1) You can apply that logic to anything. Many MPs own businesses, does that mean their opinion on business law is tainted? Most own property, does that mean they shouldn't be able to decide on any law related to property? Where do you draw the line?

2) A far, far more important interest to an MP than their own interests are those of their constituents, as without their support they'll be out on their ear anyway at the next election. There are well over a million BTL landlords in the UK, and of course tens of millions of home owners. Politicians don't want to affect planning laws (which is one of the main root causes behind the housing crisis) primarily because it will piss off literally tens of millions of voters! They will be brought into line by the party whip before any important vote on such issues anyway - the fact that they may own a BTL property or house themselves doesn't really even come into it.

What you've effectively done here, is call the whole thing a conspiracy and declared that the country is run based on vested interests. All you're relly doing is showing your ignorance to the whole process of democracy under which we live, but this being /r/UK it will be up voted relentlessly anyway, mainly by those who want to believe that the reason they've failed to achieve their goals in life thus far is because they weren't given any opportunity to do so.

this is not a loan like those provided by the uk government (to uk citizens). this is a lender charging you nearly 12% interest, and the repayments are not linked to your income.  

if i go to my bank (first direct) and try to get an unsecured personal loan, i can get interest of under 5%, and that's from their front page, not like i'm getting any special treatment for being their customer or anything.  the repayment profile is comparable as well.

i don't know the company, and maybe the advantage here is that they provide finance specifically to students (who may have a hard time convincing a ""normal"" bank to lend to them), and presumably you will get an answer quite promptly.  but the rate of interest strikes me as high. not wonga-high, but not competitive either.

with both loans i've discussed, there would be repayments to be made while studying. does your gf have income to cover these?",null,0,null,1435058627,null,0,false,0,csfs2qj,null,t3_3atdxg,null,t1_csfs2qj,null,t3_3atdxg,null,null,null,1437280931,null,4,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,4,null

Erm, 30,000 calories (assuming we're working on the calorie = kcal convention since the last time anyone used 'calorie' as a discrete unit was about 1880) is 125.5 MJ. Body fat has an energy density of 14.64MJ/lb - so that's almost 9lb of adipose tissue.

I'm not absolutely certain, but that strikes me as an improbable amount for daily storage. Hell, the major problem would be absorption - plasma would be saturated beyond the point at which further absorption from the digestive tract is remotely efficient well before the sort of levels you'd need to make up 9lbs of adipose tissue.

null,false,Sir_Bantersaurus,null,null,null,"&gt; Let's again, go back to some numbers: reports that a quarter of a million people joined the anti-austerity march last weekend proved wide of the mark - that would have filled not just Parliament Square but Whitehall, Trafalgar Square and the Strand - and the most optimistic figure of total attendees, including the ones who sloped off for a pint or a wedding halfway through, is probably around 25,000. Let's say that just 10,000 of them can be convinced that the Labour party, even one led by Corbyn, is worth the candle. Then they each need to recruit five friends. If just one of those five friends recruits another friend, Corbyn could be Labour's next leader. 

Is this article a joke? If 10,000 of them join and then each of them get another 5 five people to join and each of those get another 1 person then he could win? That's why we're certain he can't win because you have to come up with such a ludicrous scenario to see a chance at all.

null,false,SomeSortOfWiseGuy,null,null,null,"Back in 1965, an obese Scotsman of 27 years and 456 pounds came to the Department of Medicine in Dundee, Scotland, with a problem. He needed to lose weight. A (1/8 of a) ton of it. The doctors suggested maybe not eating for a few days could help. It was just an offhand recommendation, but our Scotsman (known only as “AB”) really took to it. He stayed at the hospital for several days, taking only water and vitamin pills while undergoing observation to ensure nothing went wrong. When his time was up, he continued the fast back at home, returning to the hospital only for regular monitoring. After a week, he was down five pounds and feeling good. His vitals checked out, blood pressure was normal, and though he had lower blood sugar than most men, he didn’t seem particularly impaired by it. The experiment continued… for 382 days.

Yes, AB fasted for 382 days, drinking only water and taking vitamin, potassium, and sodium supplements. All told, he lost 276 pounds, reaching his target weight of 180 pounds and maintaining the bulk of his weight loss. Over the five following years of observation, AB regained just sixteen pounds, putting him in excellent, but underpopulated territory (at least 80% of dieters eventually regain all the lost weight).

I interviewed a few of the Jaguars when they were here last, and they love coming to the UK, but the travel takes it out of them and it kills training for a day or two. Add this on top of the travel between states, and the number of available training days drops dramatically for visiting teams. Can't see it happening until they invent better methods of travel.

The auto cup scheme was open exclusively to season ticket holders between Wednesday 17th June to Monday 22nd June at 8am which guaranteed them a seat for every home game in the competition the enrolled for.

At 8:30 am on Monday 22nd June, they opened it out to all members. That's the situation at the moment - both season ticket holders and members can sign up to the autocup scheme and be guaranteed a seat for all the home games in the cup of their choice.

Looking at the new queue now, I can see 94 posts from the last 7 days, which is 13.4 per day. I don't see such a rich mix, as you suggest. Its mainly cakes, cosplay, and merchandising. I think more traffic would be a good thing. You know you can hide posts once you have voted on them, if you feel they are hanging around too long? I don't mind any of these posts personally. I find the mix too narrow is all, and the conversation often stifled. If you don't like a post, you can always vote it down. This isn't supposed to be a static list of items.

Regarding my taking anything personally, if you look at my posting history you can infer that I have had a *lot* of stuff removed from many subreddits over the years. Most of the time it's ok, as I can understand what the mods and the rules are intending to achieve. It's only for /r/doctorwho (and to a lesser extent, /r/gadgets) which concern me, because as well as the irritation of removals. I think I am missing out on posts which others make. I think we have had some good discussion about posts which have then been taken down, with everyone involved irritated by it if they realise. 

I really just want to see this subreddit improved. Reddit is the best place for many things, and it seems perverse that an FB group, filled with people commenting  ""Daleks are stupid because they can't go up stairs"", and ""Which is your favourite Doctor Who?"" over and over again, is actually more interesting and friendly to read than /r/doctorwho.

The price was the rise of Hamas. A generation of children who grew up with broken bones from Israeli soldiers with no jobs and rampant poverty and often losing land to land grabs so living in a refugee camp.

*Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, an SNP MP, recounted the experience of one of her constituents, who was sanctioned for missing a jobcentre appointment while he was in hospital recovering from a heart attack.*

*One of the most ruthlessly power-hungry Nationalists among the contingent – self-styled as the “fantastic 56” – is Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh OBE. The 44-year-old lawyer, Bollywood actress, women’s rights campaigner, failed Tory candidate, political butterfly and now SNP MP for Ochil and South Perthshire, has been on an ideological odyssey across the political spectrum in search of office...*

*...There was further embarrassment when it also emerged that she had been a Labour member in the mid-1990s, when Tony Blair was in the ascendency. It had all been a misunderstanding, she claimed, as her uncle – a Labour councillor – had told her to join the party (for two years) if she wanted to deliver leaflets for him. “All Tasmina needs is the Lib Dems for a full set,” said a former colleague. “But she was far too ambitious to waste her time on the Liberals.”*

*Someone else who worked closely with her was Clive Schmulian, her Tory election agent in 1999. The experience left him pleased to see her leave the party. “She was desperate for a high profile and has a huge ego but she was very politically naive,” he told the Daily Telegraph. “The SNP are welcome to her.

&gt; Regarding Firmino, it seems that just about everyone on /r/soccer hasn't watched him play. They look at his stats and assume he's some goal scoring/assisting machine in the bundesliga. For starters, he was best used as an attacking midfielder. We already have Coutinho and Lallana. He's not an out and out forward and although he can play there that's not his ideal position. Firmino has a good touch and is good on the dribble, but he doesnt have blazing speed. He's quite average, and when BR eventually puts him on the wing he's gonna fail. Firmino also reminds me of Aspas in terms of his presence on the pitch. For the national team he doesn't have the confidence about him. He doesnt take guys 1v1 and he doesn't really set the pace of the game. He's kinda of just there. He missed a clear chance against Colombia, but those things happen to every football and it shouldn't be looked at too much as I have seen some people mentioned on here. But he's just not the kinda of guy to dictate a game and take over games. He's a BR guy in the sense that he's a team player first, as in he'll work for the team defensively, but we need guys that will take us to the next level. Firmino is just another squad player in my opinion. And this is of course just my opinion. I have watched him enough where I just dont see him being worth what we would pay for him. If I were him I wouldn't leave the Bundesliga as it's clear that he can play there. But even then, look at the games where he excelled, not many against top teams. He's just another run of the mill Brazilian, nothing more nothing less. The issue isn't that we want to purchase him, the issue is that we want to purchase him for a high price. I don't think he's worth anywhere near what's being rumored.

null,false,bockers7,lfc99,,null,"I made this comment earlier today. I don't want to shit on anyones excitement but I just don't have any faith in Firmino. 

&gt; Regarding Firmino, it seems that just about everyone on /r/soccer hasn't watched him play. They look at his stats and assume he's some goal scoring/assisting machine in the bundesliga. For starters, he was best used as an attacking midfielder. We already have Coutinho and Lallana. He's not an out and out forward and although he can play there that's not his ideal position. Firmino has a good touch and is good on the dribble, but he doesnt have blazing speed. He's quite average, and when BR eventually puts him on the wing he's gonna fail. Firmino also reminds me of Aspas in terms of his presence on the pitch. For the national team he doesn't have the confidence about him. He doesnt take guys 1v1 and he doesn't really set the pace of the game. He's kinda of just there. He missed a clear chance against Colombia, but those things happen to every football and it shouldn't be looked at too much as I have seen some people mentioned on here. But he's just not the kinda of guy to dictate a game and take over games. He's a BR guy in the sense that he's a team player first, as in he'll work for the team defensively, but we need guys that will take us to the next level. Firmino is just another squad player in my opinion. And this is of course just my opinion. I have watched him enough where I just dont see him being worth what we would pay for him. If I were him I wouldn't leave the Bundesliga as it's clear that he can play there. But even then, look at the games where he excelled, not many against top teams. He's just another run of the mill Brazilian, nothing more nothing less. The issue isn't that we want to purchase him, the issue is that we want to purchase him for a high price. I don't think he's worth anywhere near what's being rumored. 

Signing Firmino as one of our 'big name' additions just really shows me where we are as a club. I'm sure a lot of you will disagree with me, but he just doesnt have 'it' to be an LFC player. I hope he proves me wrong and if he joins our ranks I'll be the first one to root him on. I just dont see him having what it takes.

. I actually like the cold weather, probably one of the few things keeping me here, but there are other countries with much colder climates out there that I'd be happy with

. Yes Cadbury's, but others have said they're actually getting bought out now :( cadbury's tastes awesome

. NHS is a good thing to a certain extent, but it there has been a swathe of issues lately, rather than looking at fixing the problems people will just go ""Those fucking tories""

. Police will still kick the shit out of you if you protest and a riot happened when one guy ended up getting shot, surprised people forgot about the Tottenham riots already

. Too many facual inaccuracies about crime and the standard of living etc. to go through individually or I'll turn this into a huge political argument so lets leave it at that ( please don't get me started on the retarded housing market here, please don't, come and pick a fight with me on the Anarchist subreddits if you want instead ;P )

. You guys forgot another thing, cornish ice cream, that's pretty nice :D

. Yes comedy is normally quite good here, but because of political correctness it's gone down the shitter because people who say outrageous things are now attacked for it and others are too afraid to say anything so they become bland and boring

. Public footpaths? Not sure, kind of on the fence about them, it's one thing to do it to farmers but they seem to have gotten rather invasive and people do shitty things like leaving the gates open and so on which of course means livestock etc. gets killed

. As regards to which countries I'm considering, I'm primarily thinking about Japan, but also am looking at places like Finland and Switzerland, it all depends on what happens to me in the next couple of years

As for the negativity, I do get you guys, but there's also.... Well, there's no other way of politely saying it, willful ignorance and stupidity floating around. I know I mock the Americans for it but we've got a serious case of it over here as well, people are either too blindly optomistic or too negative about anything and everything.

It makes sense in that if we do add Fimino, we'll inevitably neglect someone whether it's Marko/Ibe/Origi so maybe one of them would be better off on loan but Ibe would be the last one on the list for me from them. I know Marko was 20m &amp; Origi is a very promising player who I also really have high hopes fo, but I can say I'm very much confident in Ibe heading places. Origi wil not like it but a loan again, for him to a PL club (which I'm sure there will be some suitors in the lower table) may be the best option if we were to loan one of these, as he could acclimate to the PL. Thing about Origi is that he could also slot in ST for us, it's all too complicated tbh.

I think the problem for a lot of these people is that they keep being told that immigration is great, nothing wrong with it, but at the same time that the country has huge debt, housing, health and education are being squeezed, people are demonised for not being as motivated, able bodied, skilled and willing to work for as cheap as immigrants/migrants. Then there's how communities have definitely changed. There are areas where you walk down with all of the open air stalls, sari shops, mosques, the sight of lots of Muslims, Orthodox Jews or whatever. People are afraid of that show of culture and difference. Workers bring their families with them or send money home, claim tax credits, etc., so people are suspicious of the idea that they really do put in more than they take out.. maybe more so over generations rather than the initial people. Don't discount the factor of envy if they see immigrants doing better than themselves.

Anecdote here but an American acquaintance is at Glasgow doing a masters and they keep asking me 'why are there so many beggars from India'? To which I feel uncomfortable and have no answer not least of all because they aren't even Indian half the time. It doesn't come across as positive immigration to have people coming in to be beggars. 

Even I don't really buy into it. I think that we should be mindful of population growth and how bad it is for the country (overcrowding, less resources to go around) and the environment.

MPs are underpaid as it is for the work and the hours that they do. If we cut it, only the independently wealthy would be able to do it.

&gt; Lords expenses

Buttons, given that they don't get paid a salary.

&gt; quango culls

We've done that, but we should of course look to go further if we can.

&gt; defence cuts (Trident)

Trident is exceptionally good value for what it is and I wholeheartedly support it's renewal.

&gt; vanity projects such as HS2

Perhaps the business case for HS2 in it's currently form isn't great, but there IS a need to invest in infrastructure upgrades to grow the economy even if this particular one isn't the best example, so I'm not sure that there is much to be saved in cutting it only to replace the spending with something else.

&gt; while the gap can be plugged with new Land Value and, as you say, Mansion Taxes to rebalance some of the wealth inequality in the country while keeping the coffers filled.

Ah see, now the goalposts are shifting slightly. Do you want to tackle the deficit or do you wish to tackle wealth inequality?

They sometimes compliment each other, but it's not always the case that one automatically feeds into the other.

&gt; I take a different view. I believe that the rise of right wing governments (not applicable everywhere but certainly here) is down to people looking for someone to blame for the economic downturn

There are lots of people to blame, but pointing fingers and looking for someone to blame doesn't actually solve any of the problems or get us anywhere.

Whilst Labour were particularly good at opening the flood taps and spending money (and they haven't been entirely honest about facing up to this), I don't think it helps to talk about ""Labour's recession"" or ""Labour's financial crash"". Sure it's electorally useful, but I can't honestly say that the Conservatives wouldn't have adopted the same lax approach to regulation and oversight in the financial service sector.

They wouldn't have spent so much public money however, we can be sure of that.

Undetermined: 4/15

* Lallana (definitely feel we paid over the odds, funnily enough, I wanted Firmino so badly when we were looking at Lallana)
* Allen (Not undetermined, just not a hit or flop - solid)
* Markovic
* Lovren (Still have some faith, not writing him off yet until next season) 


We should account for inflation though in regards to Firmino, in the footballing/financial world. Regardless though, I'll take it, every day of the week. 

Only thing that concerns me is that he's very well known so there must be other suitors, United were linked w/ him just recently &amp; was supposed to be close to a done deal (seems to happen all the time w/ them tho). City also have had links but not as strongly as ours.

Let's just hope.
