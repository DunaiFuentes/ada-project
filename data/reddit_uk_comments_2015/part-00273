It's essentially the extension of the logical fallacy 'appeal to authority', the idea that a person, or group, knows best, and therefore their ideas should be implemented, regardless of other considerations, because they know best. (circular logic).

The idea that we, or anyone, has a good solution to the problems currently faced in Syria and Iraq, or that we should act on them even if we have them, is fairly fuzzy, and I am distrustful of people who insist that we do.

Even scarier, is when it's fairly plain that we don't have a good solution, we have a bad one, but we go ahead and impose it anyway (british military personnel dropping bombs on a country we haven't declared war against)

To explain my mention of the royal family: true story: I met a guy, multiple people agreed with him - who thought that because the queen is technically the commander in chief of the British army and head of the armed forces, that she could, in certain fanciful circumstances, decide to take it upon herself to direct the military to intervene to solve some perceived problem (i.e. wrest control of the country from parliament if she saw fit). Frankly and simply, she can't do that, and the monarchy is a largely pointless and arbitrary institution, making no judgements on quality.

I believe, that the logic such people follow, in which, they decide that someone, the queen for example, is 'good' in their estimation, that that person could be given supreme executive power in a situation, and if they did, that they could do some good. It's very possible that they could - but not guaranteed, certainly not logically to be expected.

So it is with Syria - we know best, our government knows best - we think we should conduct bombing runs against ISIL in Syria - we do it without asking or telling anyone. law or logic be damned.

null,false,Lordzoot,eng-yorkshire,Leeds,null,"&gt;You're convinced there's nothing Labour could have done to win without the SNP supporting them in Scotland

I'm not suggesting the SNP support them (that being the poisoned chalice), I'm saying if the SNP existed to prevent a Conservative government, they wouldn't have run full stop, as them running could only ever increase the possibility.

&gt;You've also said the SNP were fanning the flanning the flames and stoking the fire of Labour's issues. Either you think Labour could have won if the SNP hadn't been doing this, or the SNP doing this is not evidence that the SNP wanted to see Labour lose in England.

I think Labour would have done better in England if the SNP had not fanned those flames, yes. I can't quite tell what you're trying to say because there's a lot of double negatives in there, but I'll state my position clearly anyway: I think Labour would have done better in England if the SNP had not been contesting this election. I suspect that if the SNP had not run at all we'd probably have a hung parliament and the possibility of a leftist coalition to push Labour over the line. Obviously that's purely hypothetical as the SNP did run.

Because the SNP ran, they damaged Labour's support in England and (obviously) in Scotland. Yes, the Conservatives made political capital out of the SNP, however, the SNP also made political capital of Labour's predicament themselves, by magnifying the issue on the English doorstep. Doing so increased the likelihood of the Conservatives doing better and I believe that this was a strategic decision by the SNP as they benefit from a Conservative government (for the reasons stated above.  

&gt;I've made no such assumption. Are you making assumptions about how I voted and my motivations for doing so?

Well, I've made an assumption that you voted SNP because you said you lived and worked under them for 7 years. My suggestion that you had made an assumption about where my loyalties lie is based on the fact you suggested I felt the SNP had committed some sort of betrayal, and I don't think that.

&gt;Or...maybe the SNP wanted the Conservatives out but didn't think Labour would fail so spectacularly to do their part in England.

The existence of the SNP was one of the main reasons for Labour's failure in England and was always going to be (see above).

&gt;The number of polls that showed Labour gaining more seats than the Conservatives far outnumbered the opposite until much nearer election day.

Well, a hung parliament, yes. But if you removed the SNP from that equation altogether, Labour would have had a decisive advantage. The SNP made the possibility of a Conservative government much more likely.

&gt;So how far do her lies go? Did her MPs hope for the same? Did SNP party members hope for the same? And all of them kept telling us they wanted the Tories out? Talk about incredible party cohesion!

That is a question I can't answer. All I know is that, if I were a SNP member, my political goal would be separation from England and not ending austerity, and I'd do anything that would further those aims. As I believe they have. All's fair in love and politics and I bear her no ill will. Whether others follow on purpose or through ignorance is a matter for them. Did Ms. Black really think she can end austerity by running as an SNP candidate in an election that only Labour or the Conservatives could win and where the SNPs existence negatively affected Labour?

&gt;Is it so inconceivable that the SNP just wanted to offer Scots a voice in Westminster that wasn't whipped into line by the party headquarters in England?

They don't have a voice, because they don't have any power. Except to mischief make to make an independent Scotland more likely - which is what they're doing (and which is fair enough).

&gt;I don't agree with their decision to vote. I understand and appreciate their motivation for doing so but think it was a mistake. I'm not arguing that the SNP are saints.

On the contrary, this whole debate started because you said they had principles. I merely suggested they had no more principles than any other party. It seems we may agree on that?

The answer to you question is the fact that investing in such a nascent industry is high risk with long term returns. It is thus highly suitable for investment by governments, an institutions large enough to accommodate the risk and a time frame long enough to wait for returns.

null,false,actuallyAPerson_SS,null,null,null,"Yep. 100%. Let's say an MP got paid £27,000 (just over the UK median full-time income in 2014[^[1]](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ashe/annual-survey-of-hours-and-earnings/2014-provisional-results/stb-ashe-statistical-bulletin-2014.html)) with rises pegged to the median annual pay. It's less than I get. I wouldn't be interested in moving into any job like that although it's a perfectly liveable middle class income. Same with half the UK.

So let's say it pays £31,000. My annual income and about the 8th decile in the UK[^[2]](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/25/uk-incomes-how-salary-compare). Would I be interested? For the same amount of money, I'd get more stress and less job security. Nope. Might I be if I was earning the median? Perhaps, but you're completely pricing out 20% of the UK pegging it in the 8th decile.

Let's say we raise that, we get a higher percentage of the UK able to consider it a viable career move. So where do we peg it? MPs are currently in approximately the 95th percentile of pay[^[3]](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/percentile-points-from-1-to-99-for-total-income-before-and-after-tax) so we're excluding 5% of the UK from even considering it a worthwhile career move.

More once you include the monetary value that the stress levels, inflexibility and absent job security have to a worker.

  

Working on that logic alone, we should peg it high. But let me introduce a slightly more controversial argument. To attract successful people, we need to have it even higher than the above argument would suggest. We all know money does not equal success. We all know some incredibly successful poor people, but the inverse doesn't hold so much. If a person is commanding a 99th percentile salary from an employer (ignoring stock traders and people born into money here), then the person is successful enough for long enough to justify that salary. These people tend to be directors of sizeable firms and are directly responsible for the success of those firms. I believe we should attract them. These are people who know how to manage people and infrastructure for a successful outcome.

The 99th percentile band will contain people with a proven record of success. ""Ah"", you say. ""That isn't all true! Think of those fat cat bankers who lined their pockets whilst they caused the recession! We don't want them running the country"" That's correct, but here's the catch. The public *actively chooses* the people they place in these roles. Don't want a failed banker to get into a position of power? *Don't vote for them!* 

If you don't want that failed banker, but 98% of your fellow constituents do, the banker will get in. And that's called democracy. A lot is to be said about the broken electoral system that can cause discrepancies between public will and reality, but the public actively chose not to change it.

  

**So to summarise**: pay more and more people in general will come out of the woodwork. More choice is good. Pay even more and more successful people will come out of the woodwork. More choice with a proven track record of success is good.

And though you may complain about these MPs making so much money, remember that, via democracy, *we actively chose to give them those jobs!*",null,0,null,1437153494,null,0,1437153842,0,ct6repk,null,t3_3dlqpd,null,t1_ct6repk,null,t1_ct6lptz,null,null,null,1437939983,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

TL:DR If your an English student and plan on going to uni I hope you plan on living with relatives.

The maintenance loan is set to be £8200. I did the math and it doesn't look good.

Most students will see an above 1% increase except for one group. Those living away from home and with a household income of less than £30,000. Sadly they're the ones who probably need student finance the most.

Here are the worst cases

If you are living away from home and your household income was under £25,000 you will be ~£1117 less well off AND have £3,387 more debt. Before you would have gotten the full grant of £3,387 and about £5930 maintenance loan for £9317 total cash.

If you come from a family earning between £25,000 and £30,000 and plan on living away from home you will be ~£171 down AND have an additional £2,441 debt. Before you would have gotten the £2,441 partial grant and £5,930 maintenance loan for a total of £8371. 

If you live at home and come from a household with under £25,000 income you will be ~£100 better off but have £3,387 more debt to pay back at the end. Before you would have gotten the full grant of £3,387 and about £4715 maintenance loan for a total of £8102.

Everyone else will be seeing noticable gains above any year on year increases before because they would only have gotten partial access to the maintenance grant but can now access up to £3782 more but will have to pay it back as well as whatever grant they were eligible for.

It's bad if you come from a low income family and plan on living away from home but every other person else will see an above inflation increase.

These are large changes to student finance England and are actually detrimental to some of the poorest students which is the main point of student finance. Part of the problem is the old grant was ~~means tested~~ dependant on household income and the new loan is flat across the board for everyone in its current plan. 

Needless to say this, is not a good deal for the poorest students as the old grant didn't need to be repayed. If your lucky enough to come from a family earning over £30,000 a year or plan on living at home with your parents enjoy the extra cash, just remember youll probably end up having to pay it back.

Obviously Northern Ireland has its own Student Finance rules and values and it's not exactly sure if home rule were implemented how the new policies would translate across.

The data uses Student Finance Englands and assumes an increase of £150/£190 for the maintenance loan living with parents/living away from home. Last year the increase was £147/£185 respectively. Also assumes 0% inflation though it will probably would go very high during the next year. A 0.1% rise of £10,000 is only a tenner so it shouldn't change the values much.

That is simply wrong. Cursory glance and it's 2:1.

&gt;Alliance have spoken out on the play park in Newry 

But when will you ever be strong enough to effect the likes of Newry while in reality you concentrate on unionist constituencies?

&gt;Beacons are safe bonfires. To say I'm calling for a ban on bonfires because I want them to be safe?

You said you wanted bonfires replaced with beacons. Are you denying that?

And this 'safety' straw man that arose when you posted yet another negative link re a bonfire 'collapse'. Turns out it was while the thing was on fire - there's not a pile of wood in the world that doesn't do that. Is it unsafe? The old comparison you could get hit by a bus tomorrow applies. 

Based on many years experience, the level of risk should be proven acceptable. But yet you come along after seeing one video and believe they should get rid of bonfires. Excuse the language but what a load of balls.

&gt;There is no one sided policy, from myself nor from the party I joined. 

Let's assume for a second you're right and the CRC and a few other bodies against your most infamous cross community policy are wrong. Then you have so far only implemented your version of consensus in areas historically identified as unionist. 

The whole stance of your party will never delivery these policies in an Armagh &amp; Down or a Foyle &amp; Strabane. 

You can't affect this imbalance without a massive change in strategy. Where's that going to come from, particularly when many such as a nationalist such as yourself, are happy with the kick the unionists tactic?

&gt;I can't seem to post here these days without you self somehow turning something I post into an attack and screaming about alliance this, alliance that, alliance are in my teeth.

Hey a simple check on what you posted would reveal why - basically you're asking not to be questioned when you post pro-Alliance/anti unionist messages. I find it mildly amusing you - and other alliance supporters who brought this up - expect to get away without a response, even on this sub.

&gt;Doesn't help that you extrapolate any criticism of an individual event

Look at the first reply you made on this thread, a thread entitled 'are loyalists out of control'. You state there is no leadership from unionists. None of this is about specific events.

As I said, *you* are making the extrapolations here, and much more often than not do it with unionist politics.

&gt;I was delivering leaflets myself in EB, and the message was generally a positive one. Nothing approaching the personal attacks and snark we seen on tv and the hustings. 

Let's be clear - 'keep themmuns out' is a pretty snarky negative message no matter what way you spin it. Delivered in a leafy street just off the upper newtownards rd. Taken with the fact you drew virtually all activists into east Belfast, away from their own constituencies, how can you seriously expect loyalists to acknowledge you as 'middle ground'?

&gt;UVF  flexing muscles In EB? Again, someone gave them the cover and opportunity to do that, 

Yeah - that was provided the moment alliance decided to go against CRC advice and rollout their own flag policy.

&gt;and it's telling where those muscles were being flexed, After someone suggested that office be targeted. Who was that?

Legitimate protest is one thing, I'm referring to the weeks of violence in areas with no alliance offices. Not that that was much of a priority for your party after you steamrolled through your own idea of equality.

&gt;And again you try to conflate Long and the flag. Following that fiction to the letter. Well done.

Hey Long agreed with the Alliance councillor's decision. She stood and defended it. She can't sit back and say that hasn't been a large part of her tenure as MP. 

&gt;Who knows what way things would have gone down with Long as MP, but at least she would not have been silent on the matter.

Neither was Robinson, but as I said calling for this &amp; that doesn't get things done. Being in the streets and negotiating with those people is what will improve things. You can sit there and call for this, that and the other, we all can, but a politician's job doesn't finish there.

It was also part of the plan that the trams and buses would charge the same, so if the fares remained low it would take longer for the trams to break even.

I suspect that if the SNP had not run at all we'd probably have a hung parliament and the possibility of a leftist coalition to push Labour over the line. Obviously that's purely hypothetical as the SNP did run.

It's like you're completely ignoring that period where every poll showed a hung parliament with SNP holding the balance of power and Sturgeon repeatedly telling everyone the SNP would *never* put the Tories into government.

&gt;Because the SNP ran, they damaged Labour's support in England and (obviously) in Scotland. Yes, the Conservatives made political capital out of the SNP, however, the SNP also made political capital of Labour's predicament themselves, by magnifying the issue on the English doorstep. Doing so increased the likelihood of the Conservatives doing better and I believe that this was a strategic decision by the SNP as they benefit from a Conservative government (for the reasons stated above.)

I'd say the fault lies with Labour, not the SNP's existence.  If they had message that was distinct enough from the Conservatives' that the choice between the two didn't the amount of influence the SNP had, maybe they'd have stood a chance?

&gt;Well, I've made an assumption that you voted SNP because you said you lived and worked under them for 7 years. My suggestion that you had made an assumption about where my loyalties lie is based on the fact you suggested I felt the SNP had committed some sort of betrayal, and I don't think that.

That wasn't me.

&gt;The existence of the SNP was one of the main reasons for Labour's failure in England and was always going to be (see above).

See above.

&gt;Well, a hung parliament, yes. But if you removed the SNP from that equation altogether, Labour would have had a decisive advantage. The SNP made the possibility of a Conservative government much more likely.

There isn't an alternate universe in which the the SNP would have put the tories into power had they had the balance of power.  It'd have been political suicide.  The SNP made a hung parliament more likely, but not the a Conservative government in the event of a hung parliament more likely.

&gt;That is a question I can't answer. All I know is that, if I were a SNP member, my political goal would be separation from England and not ending austerity, and I'd do anything that would further those aims. As I believe they have. All's fair in love and politics and I bear her no ill will. Whether others follow on purpose or through ignorance is a matter for them. 

Most of the votes the SNP gained came from Labour, do you really believe that line of thinking was common amongst SNP voters?

&gt;Did Ms. Black really think she can end austerity by running as an SNP candidate in an election that only Labour or the Conservatives could win and where the SNPs existence negatively affected Labour?

They thought they could drag Labour to the left, which they might well have done.  They've provided a clear anti-austerity message, and now one of the leading candidates in the leadership election opposes austerity.  Labour didn't provide a clear anti-austerity message in the general election and likely wouldn't have if the SNP hadn't existed.

&gt;They don't have a voice, because they don't have any power. Except to mischief make to make an independent Scotland more likely - which is what they're doing (and which is fair enough).

They campaigned on the premise that they would be able to drag Labour to the left as opposed to Scottish Labour MPs having to follow UK Labour's party line, which evidently relied on people willing to vote UKIP &amp; conservative.

&gt;On the contrary, this whole debate started because you said they had principles. I merely suggested they had no more principles than any other party. It seems we may agree on that?

Absolutely, we agree on that.

&gt; VPNs are great at creating a mask for example, but it isn't impossible to follow a trail

It's not impossible to follow a trail, but without surveillance that trail can easily lead nowhere. 

E.g. have someone pick up a SIM with cash that won't be tied to him, and a MIFI device (mobile internet =&gt; wifi + battery == instance hotspot), and a few wifi bridges with batteries, and drop a trail of them from somewhere near a suitable location for you, and somewhere to place the MIFI device. Now you casually sit down in your local coffee shop with wifi and connect via 2-3 bridges to a MIFI device that can't be tied to you. Afterwards, contact removes said MIFI devices and WIFI bridges, and throws the SIM away. Repeat. Neither of you need to ever meet. Even if the MIFI device was somehow tracked after the fact, it leads to a spot a mile or more away, somewhere busy. 

Without active surveillance they've already lost at that point. Tack on an indirection or two via jump boxes in different jurisdictions that are regularly wiped and replaced, and the odds they'll get anywhere near figuring out a link to that MIFI device in the first place is minimal.

If you do your job, your final endpoint should not be a secret site, but a public discussion forum. Cat pictures on imgur.com with steganography. Porn on some amateur site etc. Your contacts, amongst many others, downloads from the same forums. Only they know to extract the right data and attempt decryption to see if any of them are from you.  Suddenly the downloads can happen from anywhere, and the uploads can be coming from anywhere, and you don't know which downloads are intentional. 

All the data flowing through all the wires in the world won't help you against that. 

Government backdoors in encryption doesn't matter - it could potentially beat public key crypto, but the old techniques still work: one-time-pads such as book codes are unbreakable if used correctly in case someone still manages to get hold of the data.

The thing is, this is advanced stuff, but it's not *difficult* stuff, and it's stuff that's easy to figure out and disseminate for a single person. It's easy to ""package up"" scripts for it. 

I don't doubt that there are people out there too dumb to think this through or too technically inept to be able to research it, or too careless to avoid direct contacts. But they're not likely to be the big threats.

I've been trying for years to incorporate good habits into my life after totally letting myself go during university and before. I've reached a good point now, moving more, eating less - but the thing that has the most sugar in my daily weekday-at-work diet now is my apple!

It's been bugging me for weeks. I really want to shove more fruit into my diet because I've identified places (my 30-40 minute bus trip to work) where I can easily form habits of 'time to eat fruit now'. I love bananas and grapes too but they would shove my sugar limit (I use my fitness pal) well over. Should I subtract them from the sugar count the app makes, halve their impact or what? I'm really trying to take things slow so I can make changes I can stick to so they will continue on in the future.

I've been a Villa fan since I can remember, and I've always loved the club.  I grew up in the early 00's, with an average Villa team, and was never used to success of any kind. When Martin O'Neill came and started spending money to get us among the top 7, I started to expect to be among the top teams, and even hoped for Champions League football. I can still remember what my father said when O'Neill had resigned. The next year or two I counted as ""leap years"" and said I would give it time to stabilize in the top 7 again. It didn't happen, and the last years have been awful. However, it isn't the clubs downfall that has sourned the relationship I have with football, it's the industry around. How filthy rich men, who earned their money unfair, splash the cash on all the best players. Even tiny little Man City could buy their way up. Clubs like Villa are the equivalent to a ""squad player"" - someone to make fill up the league. We have so little impact on the football world it is pointless. Football nowdays is just about the big guys and the star players, the plastic fans of the top clubs, the corruption of the governing organs and the filthy media.

Considering the massive amount of turnaround in the first-team, I think he may now be one of the most senior players (not including academy players). I do agree that Bentaleb could make a potentially fantastic captain in the future if his progression does not stall.

I would not hold it against Vertonghen and Lloris if they decided to part ways in favor of a Champion's League team (if we do not make it next season). Although the romantic in me thinks he is a Yid through-and-through, I would not be surprised if Bentaleb would move for better opportunities if he meets the high ceiling that his development has established. Yes, the King was undoubtedly the last great captain we have had. I can't speak for everyone, but in the back of my mind I can't help but feel that had he remained healthy he would have moved to a ""bigger"" club (casting bias aside).

I think Levy (and by extension the rest of the management) knows this. Even CL teams like the Scum lose their captains to bigger teams, but perhaps this is because their club's progress has stalled.

- By announcing the new stadium plans, Spurs have announced their ambitions to the rest of the world.

- By revamping our defense and removing chaff, Spurs have announced their commitment to providing Vertonghen and Lloris with the best support possible.

- By allowing Pochettino to have final say in transfers, Levy has (finally) openly announced his long-term commitment to a manager.

- By signing Bentaleb to a long-term deal and pay increase, Spurs have announced their recognition of his insane work ethic and commitment to the team.

Call me a dreamer, but I think these moves (which have all taken place this window) are an indication that great things are about to happen at Spurs for the next five years.

I wouldn't necessarily avoid them completely but caveat emptor. If you don't go through an agent, remember that if you have a problem (eg flooding, no electrics, cooker breaks, you break your key in the door etc etc) you'll need to go through the landlord to get it fixed. Now all landlords are not the same, but they'll all obviously be in the business of maximising profit by minimising cost. So depending on the landlord, you could end up with a problem that you're expected to live with while the landlord faffs around to find a cheap answer. Or worse, simply ignores it.

*Very broadly speaking*, you won't have that problem with an agent. The agent will know about the tenancy deposit scheme, the gas safety certificate and will be keen to stay within the law. Depending on the company, they will also be worried about complaints to their head-office.

I think your last point to me summarises why this kind of surveillance doesn't solve all of our problems; any REAL threat probably is going to know these methods and utilise them. I mean, all of these tools are just a Google search away, none of it is overly complicated!

To me personally when I think about the balance between safety and privacy, I can't help but think that if the government ends up collecting and pushing through all of my online life to the point where I can't go online without the fear of my own government turning on me for fear of terrorism, then haven't the terrorists won already?

Brown achieved GDP figures per annum of; 3.5, 3.2, 3.8, 2.7, 2.5, 4.3, 2.5, 2.8, 3.0 and 2.6%. This equates to the **longest period of unbroken growth in the modern era**.

Darling had GDP figures of ; -0.3, -4.3 and 1.9%, to put these figures into context, it should be said that Darling's chancellorship coincided with the global credit crunch, the deepest financial crisis the world has known in peace time. Yet Mr Darling managed to hand over a growing GDP of 1.9% to Mr Osbourne, an incredible turn around.

Osbourne managed to achieve GDP figures of : 1.6, 0.7, 1.7 and 2.8%, failing to match the GDP growth he was handed in 2010, until 2014, (when global oil prices had halved and inflation was set at the lowest figure ever recorded).",null,0,null,1437158143,null,0,false,0,ct6ulzo,null,t3_3dmsad,null,t1_ct6ulzo,null,t1_ct6ppki,null,null,null,1437942670,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

null,false,Esco91,null,null,null,"Avoid doing the stuff you have to pay for in London, you can do that kind of thing in York or Edinburgh cheaper, but London has tonnes more museums (free) and events.

For example don't bother with the London Dungeon, it costs £25 and queues in high summer are like 90 minutes long. Instead go to York Dungeon, the same idea by the same company, with better sketches (cos most of the tourists are British, Scandinavian or American and can understand better English) but for £15 and you'll only be waiting 20 mins or so. All the 'privately owned museum experience' type things in London are overpriced and have long queues in summer (especially when it rains), but anything that's a publicly owned museum is free and all the historic buildings that are [English Heritage](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/) are usually reasonably priced (there are exceptions, ahem Stonehenge)

In London check out Camden Market/Locks, that's the place to pick up all the standard souvenirs but at a reasonable price, plus that small area is probably about the most diverse place in Western Europe, possibly the world, when it comes to street food. Also regarding food in London (and all over the UK tbh), when your wallet starts to sweat after a few days but you need a cheap meal out, Wetherspoons is a pretty good bet.

Also I assume as you're Danish you are beer drinkers - tours of York Brewery are cheap and well worth it. For most Brits these days York has a very strong drinking and pub tradition, so thats a good way to get involved without getting hammered drunk. Jorvik Centre is a Must-Do for Danes as well, I'd say.

Finally I would suggest a visit to nearby Knaresborough while you are in York. You'll get some beautiful nature of the classic English variety, and then there is [Mother Shiptons cave](http://www.mothershipton.co.uk/) which is pretty cool. If you really want to see cool historic stuff, you might also make a visit to Leeds purely for the [Royal Armories](https://www.royalarmouries.org/home) They also have a smaller RA in the Tower of London, but then you have to have paid for the ToL.

Frankly what you've written is so ridiculous I couldn't be bothered to go point by point. However, since you invite it.

You've claimed.

&gt;Wind turbines are not competing with massive gas extraction.

Well, they are, as I outlined above on the generation output side they comprise 15% of current generation and that output has risen 13TwH in just three years and renewables will overhaul gas generation output by 2018, gas output has been on the wane since 2000.

&gt;The British Geological Survey reports that we've got shale gas reserves in the UK which would put us somewhere between number 3 and number 1 in the world for gas reserves.

Again as I've shown the report claimed no such thing because as little as 10% of that is accessible and they lack confidence in their assessment of the upper number.

&gt;That would give us a roughly equal amount of recoverable gas to Iraq's proven reserves

Nowhere near, I mean not even close to that. We have the 24th largest proven reserves in the world Iraq has the 12th. 

&gt;You're conflating electricity generation and primary energy production

No I'm not.

&gt;firstly, we don't subsidise the oil industry in this country

Yes. [We do](http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/74519000/jpg/_74519696_74519695.jpg). Around [£1.2 billion a year in fact](http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/9245.pdf) and that number is expanding. Actually its the same size as the subsidy received by the print media.

&gt;Primary energy production is not the same as electricity production.

Funny that it shows the same trends then.

I don't know why you think primary energy production backs up your case at all, what it actually [shows](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/437455/Energy_Trends_June_2015.pdf) is a continuing downward trend in the production of gas since 2000 and a continuing increase in renewables as I suggested.

He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy. (Matthew 10:34-37)

Your god is more important than your family to the point you should put them to the sword if they think otherwise.

And every one who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundred-fold, and inherit eternal life. (Matthew 19:29)

If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple. (Luke 14:26)

For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge? Go judge those outside. ""Drive out the wicked person from among you."" (1 Corinthians 5:12-13)

This is a nice one, if they aren't Christian drive them away. very community orientated.

...a Canaanite woman ...came out and cried, ""Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely possessed by a demon. But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, ""Send her away, for she is crying after us."" He answered, ""I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."" But she came and knelt before him, saying, ""Lord, help me."" And he answered, ""It is not fair to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."" (Matthew 15:23)

if you are not one of us go die dog. oh very Christian.

It is actually reported that there is immorality among you, and of a kind that is not found even among pagans; for a man is living with his father's wife.... Let him who has done this be removed from among you.... with the power of Lord Jesus, you are to deliver this man to Satan, for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. (1 Corinthians 5:1-5)

kill the pagans so there spirits can be saved by god. 

But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of every woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.... any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled dishonors her head ...For if a woman will not veil herself, then she should cut off her hair ...For a man ought not to cover his head; since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. (For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.) 1 Corinthians 11:2-10

women know your place.

Wives, be submissive to your husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. As the church is subject to Christ, so let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands. (Ephesians 5:21-24)

no seriously women know your place damn it!

...the women should keep silence in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as even the law says. If there is anything they desire to know, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church. (1 Corinthians 14:34-35)

Women have we drilled it into your head yet?

Let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be defamed. (1 Timothy 6)

slavery is ok too.

These are all quotes out of the new testament. words spoken by Jesus himself. anyone who calls themselves Christian has to agree with all of the above on some level. otherwise they don't follow the head of their faith. so if you say you are a Christian you either agree with the above, a hypocrite or deluded.

Now, in midfield we already have Gueye, Westwood, Sanchez, and Gardner. With the assumption that we want to be playing with two attack-minded wingers (Grealish and Gil maybe), I would want to be playing with some defensive options in midfield. 

Gueye is a box-to-box ball winner and hard worker. Sanchez is a leg-breaker, but Gary and Westy are both less defensive (more technically based game). We have been linked recently to Huddlestone, who, IMO, is a more skillful version of Sanchez. I would rather we bring in Leroy Fer to provide energy along with his technical ability.

Austin - 15mil

Adebayor - 2mil

Fer - 8mil

Amavi - 9mil

=34mil

Option from here (that I like) would be Huddlestone (4mil) and Carroll (loan). 

We definitely would still have some cash to splash. We were trying to buy Amavi before we sold Benteke, so we would probably still have 12-16 million we could spend. I would like to bring in a RB as Richards wants to play centrally. Maybe Victor Sanchez or Stefan Bell (bth 4 mil). Even both maybe. Sanchez can play anywhere.

null,false,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,null,"&gt;Sorry, but the graph I linked to is the official DECC estimate for Primary Energy Consumption and shows the same trends as production. Once again you're wrong.

Can you read? Read the title of the graph you linked, it says ""Future sources of electricity"". That is, what are we going to make our electricity out of in the future. That is not the same thing as primary energy production.

&gt;Well, they are, as I outlined above on the generation output side they comprise 15% of current generation and that output has risen 13TwH in just three years and renewables will overhaul gas generation output by 2018, gas output has been on the wane since 2000.

Ugh, no. The reason that the answer to this is ""just no"" is because gas **production** is a separate thing from the use of gas to generate electricity. Gas is a primary energy source with which we can a variety of things, from using it for central heating, to using it as a vehicle fuel, to generating electricity, to creating fertilisers, and of course also simply for selling as a commodity. You are comparing combined cycle turbine generation, which uses natural gas, with wind farms, and yes those are two forms of electricity generation which inevitably compete with each other in terms of price and environmental effects, but that is not what is at stake here, what we're discussing is gas *production*.

&gt;Again as I've shown the report claimed no such thing because as little as 10% of that is accessible and they lack confidence in their assessment of the upper number.

10% of a very big number is still a very big number. No country will recover 99% of its proven gas reserves, so yes, the report does place us somewhere very near the top of the list of gas reserves, if their numbers are even remotely accurate (which of course will require considerable further seismic data to show whether they are low balling or over-estimating - since that's how science works).

&gt;Nowhere near, I mean not even close to that. We have the 24th largest proven reserves in the world Iraq has the 12th.

I said *would*, because the shale reserves, given the relative newness and uncertainty surrounding anything approaching exact volumes, have not been added to our natural gas proven reserves by any organisation I've found, and if you're looking at wikipedia then you're looking at our gas reserves sans-shale.

&gt;No I'm not.

Well you've repeatedly stated that a chart showing predicted future electricity production shows primary energy production so I'm pretty bloody sure you are, frankly.

&gt;Yes. We do[1]  . Around £1.2 billion a year in fact[2] and that number is expanding. Actually its the same size as the subsidy received by the print media.

Nah, we really don't. We subsidise **fossil fuels** in this country, in that we provide tax breaks for lorry drivers so they get cheaper diesel, and we give old people lots of money every year so they can have their heating on over the winter, but the UK government gives absolutely no money to the oil **industry** in this country. There's a good OECD report kicking about showing that, which I'll maybe look out for you.

&gt;Funny that it shows the same trends then.

No, it's really not, because electricity generation uses a huge amount of our energy, and with our own domestic fossil fuel reserves declining our gas prices are gradually increasing and so it becomes more expensive to make electricity with it, so other things are used which are cheaper.

I don't know what chart or page you want me looking at in the 2015 Energy Trends report but if you'd like to say then I'll have a look.

Ultimately speaking here, you seem to be under the impression that I'm taking a position against electricity generation with renewable sources, which I'm not, I support the use of renewables for electricity generation.

If you've never had a job and got the time spare then considering volunteering. Even if you do a day a week you'll have skills and experience to talk about along with a fresh reference.


How old are you? If you're young then you might have the cheaper wage advantage. (Gonna assume your out of school/uni but not employed yet?)


You need to be creative with your cv if you want it to stand out online but competition is really high online. You don't have formal work experience but you do know how to be a team player from X sport at school. Your a good communicator which is why you were chosen to speak for X events within school or at church when younger.  Your quick to pick things up and learn new skills ie a range of subjects just studied.
Look at the buzzwords in the job ads your applying for and build your cv around it. Some recruiters will just scan cvs for keywords that match what the client wants. Try to tailor your cv to each role if you can.  You can build up some evidence for each buzzword generally.


I would advise though that you go out in person and track down a job. Competition online is so fierce that recruiters can throw up ads for min wage jobs with loads of experience and plenty of people will apply and even after short listing some by criteria they'll have plenty to interview.


So get out and actively find one.  Get a nice 1 pager cv printed out and go around the local shops or in town and ask to speak to the manager. If the manager/owner isn't available then ask for their name and when they are normally in. Next time ask for the manager by name and get talking to them to see if they've anything going atm or coming up.


My first job was the local shop doing papers, I just wandered in an asked, they handed me a bundle and that was me (13p a paper). After that I asked in a restaurant in town and became a kitchen porter over the summer. Then asked in a local shop and started stacking shelves and doing till for about 2 years until I left for uni. And even in uni 2 of 3 jobs I had was by wandering in asking for the right person, get talking and see where I could help out.



Don't just drop off cvs though, normally they go into a pile and are cleared out every now and again cos you don't really know how up to date it is anymore.  Get it to some senior enough and preferably in person.  A good tip is to get the owners name and when they're gonna be in and then come back and and casually ask to speak to X.  People sometimes assume you know them and are a bit less guarded. Used to use that on the phone too to get past secretaries and stuff. ""hey can I speak to john?"" passed to john, ""Hello there Mr Smith I'm calling because....""   Bypassing the gatekeeper.

After that it's just charming them into working out where you fit in. ""I'm keen to work here because it's walking distance, I know the store and area very well and it's always seemed like a good place to work when i've been in.""   landed a job with subway as a student this way, new to the city and had never eaten a subway before.

In moderation, yes.

They contain lots of nutrients, but a lot of sugar too, and modern cultivars of fruits are much, much sweeter than their ancestor fruits from a few hundred years ago. However, the fibre in fruit helps mitigates the harm, unless you're drinking juice, because fibre inhibits fructose absorption. And that fibre, along with the fruit's water, will make you feel full up and sated.

Do keep on eating them, but don't go completely nuts, and avoid dried fruit at all costs (a handful of dried apricots are a great way to exceed your daily sugar threshold).",null,0,null,1437161490,null,0,false,0,ct6wu3i,null,t3_3dlrl1,null,t1_ct6wu3i,null,t1_ct6t6nl,null,null,null,1437944539,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

**Positives:**

* MOTM Gil. He really is special. Put in amazing long pass to Gabby (which he bottled). Can hold on to the ball easily and can get away from players (outdribbled three Bragans going after him)

* Richards refrained himself from drifting forward and it showed, we we're solid at the back

* Hutton was quite good going forward, even though he's not that solid with his first touch

* Cissokho made a succesful cross!

* Westy distributed the ball well

* Bunn made some good saves in the second half

* Overall we were very good and dare I say the dominant force in the first half

**Negatives:**

* Gabby can't play as a single striker, there needs to be someone with a good first touch and who know where to stand

* Sinclair went missing, had one shot but otherwise he wasn't present

* N'Zogbia doesn't care. He had a good free kick but he doesn't give a shit anymore

* Cole played too deep and should have played in Tonev's place

* Second half was so poor Kozák featured defensively more than offensively

&amp;nbsp;

I believe having a box to box like Gueye will really cement our play together. It showed that our midfield was a bit too static. Not sure about Sinclair being a starter.

In a midfield three he would be out to the left in the front three or on the bench.  So that leaves 6 people competing for 3 midfield spots... one of whom is Rossiter.  I'm perfectly okay with that.  Then we have Firmino, Coutinho, Lallana, Ibe and Markovic competing for two attacking midfield/winger spots and Benteke, Ings, Origi and Sturridge whenever he returns competing for one to two striker spots.  Not only does this allow for rotation and cover, but also flexibility in tactics.

How many attackers does Arsenal have?  Well, let's see...

As to broadband and utilities... the answer is: it depends. Some landlords offer you a set payment up front for however much you use, but the more normal answer is ""you're responsible for bills"". Don't forget too that you'll be liable for council tax. The cost of ground rent or monthly service charge for a flat normally falls to the landlord.

The best thing to do is to ask the Landlord / existing tenant / agent for advice on these existing points. And if you're doing a flatshare, for goodness sake agree the payment arrangements up front. The last thing you want is to naively agree it's your name on the bill and be landed with that cost if your flatmate doesn't pay.

I have noticed all that. All his supporters breeze right over it and his popularity only continues to grow as the hardcore party activists participating in the election dont take into consideration how much this'll damage Labour's reputation in the public eye. The anti-Corbyn battlecry goes both ways here and on other social media, even saying 'I support Andy Burnham' is met with swarms of cries of 'RED TORY RED TORY RED TORY'

&gt; Burnham's dug himself into the hole he's in, he's offered nothing but wishy-washy soundbites and clearly got complacent regarding the amount of PLP nominations he had. While he's been tripping himself up over the ""Best of times, worst of times Manifesto"" Cooper's been pretty steady, she's got my 2nd preference right now.

She (13) had* a little half-brother (9 years) who I never really met, so I was kinda bouncy about meeting him at last after hearing how amazing he is and all that jeff. We arrived nice and early, me and friend hugged, and we got invited inside. Now, this is one of those houses that gets cleaned *daily* - it's completely spotless and I can always remember mum complaining about it on the way home. To this day, I don't know how they had kids and kept that place so bloody clean.

So we're inside, shoes off and going out to the garden and I'm looking around to see if I can see her brother and she looks at me, probably a little confused on why I'm not following her to her little shed or whatever the fuck it was. After a while of just standing there (or like twenty seconds), I ask where her brother is and she catches on. Apparently, he's in the livingroom.

Okay, so we woddle off to the livingroom and sitting on the sofa is this little nine-year-old kid with a bottle of vodka beside him on the table and a mug. Naturally, I just assume he's drinking water and his father (friend's step-father) put some vodka there as a joke, or left it there when he went to work (he's Russian).

So friend introduces me to her brother, and this little arrogant shit holds out his hand for me to shake while repeating the greeting in some half-decent Russian. I was brought up to be polite, so shake hands with him and awkwardly try to make conversation when it's remarkably clear he's pissed off at being interrupted from the movie he's watching (and guess what? It was in Russian with English subtitles). So after a few minutes, friend suggests we go outside and then come back for lunch.

When lunch arrives and we go to eat, her brother brings through the vodka and plonks it on the table. This kid's really playing up to the jokes, *da*? Half-way through lunch, the front door opens and some guy (step-/father) comes in speaking some decent Russian rather loudly while expecting everyone to know what the fuck he's saying. His son, clearly, does and grabs the vodka. The father takes it and undoes the cap and I'm sitting there like ""huh, fucking knew it"" but then he begins pouring into the mug and puts the cap back on and hands it to his son before going to the fridge where he gets the milk out and pours himself a tall glass before retreating to his manroom (or study or dungeon or whatever).

Mum decides it's time we leave and we get the fuck outta there before the kid begins asking to play strip poker or something.

Burnham seems to think because he has a northern accent it's his god-given right to lead the party. I've seen him say ""We should have that debate"" on many issues like immigration and then fail to debate it, at a hustings no less.

They both did the same thing, just Burnham wasn't as quick and was more calculated.

Their attack overall just so much better than their defense and has been for a couple of years, which I guess is why they've kind of relied on the strategy of outscoring instead of defending a lead. 

I think this season (just like last) depends on whether or not Pellegrino can inspire his players to play well.

We had to take an entrance exam with a follow-up interview to get in.  Presumably school reports had to be seen as well, though I don't know.

&gt;Would a P.O. box number be acceptable as a mailing address?

I would guess almost certainly not, not least as there would be ""off"" weekends when pupils went home.  The school would have been shut and no pupils were allowed on site.

&gt; Handing out a fake phone number would be very tricky, could my characters' parents just explain that no phone number is available, or call the school every day from a payphone until they get lucky, the school was just about to contact them, or arrange for face to face meetings only?

If they're paying hundreds of pounds a term, it's very unlikely they wouldn't have a home phone.  I'm sure even back then it would have looked dodgy.

&gt;Would the school accept a cash payment for the entire year?

Maybe.  My parents paid termly as per the school's invoices and a cheque.  Cash might be seen as dodgy.

&gt; My characters' parents are looking for an all girls school in Surrey, what might tuition look like for that time and place?

I'd suggest seeing if you can find some old school magazines which might show the shape of what lessons looked like in a girls' school.  The one in ""my"" town in Surrey was called Eothen.

&gt; If her parents send her to a school with an entrance exam, can she bring her own pen to take the exam? What about tests throughout the school year, will the teachers force her to use their pens?

Milner: Experienced and quality premier league veteran, should help to ease the impact of the departure of Gerrard.

Ings: Both a very solid back up striker and good english prospect for the future, who fits into Rodgers' style of play (Unlike last years back ups Lambert, Balotelli)

Bogdan: Upgrade and replacement for back up keeper Brad Jones who left after his contract expired.

Clyne: High quality English player who will improve the starting 11 and replace Glen Johsnon who left after his contract expired.

Benteke: Very high quality striker who will be a good partner to Sturridge when he is fit, and pretty much almost as good as Sturridge, so we don't have to worry as much when Sturridge is injured.

But, with regards to his three points:

&gt; a) The ASA genuinely do a brilliant job, but they really aren’t appointed to be the arbiter of theological matters, I think they’ve overstepped their remit.

They're not acting as an arbiter of theological matters. The fact that prayer has no effect whatsoever is a scientific fact - any other view is unsubstantiated nonsense.

&gt; b) As a Christian I believe that prayer helps – although my belief is that God mostly heals through medicine, surgery and human compassion and ingenuity.

He's welcome to believe any nonsense he likes, not sure how that's relevant though. 

&gt; c) Freedom of speech – an organisation that makes a faith based claim that is clearly subjective (in the same way that a political party makes subjective claims) should be able to make those claims within reason.

This is not a freedom of speech issue. These types of claims are dangerous, literally - people have died after seeking faith-based healing instead of conventional treatment.

* ST: Mattia Destro - £10-12m
* ST: Seydou Doumbia - £Loan with an Option to Buy (Same deal Watford were rumored to be chasing)

** Total: £37m - £43m
Some of those players (Destro and Doumbia especially) are risks, but they'd give us verve, intelligence and great work rate up top. Doumbia especially being praised for his eam work. Which should allow us to get more out of the more attacking Midfielders such as Gil, Sinclair, Grealish and Praet or Darder. Maing us a threat from all over the pitch rather just on or two players, which is HUGELY important for us, especially if to get some of these players we may have to accept we'll be a stepping stone for some of them.

Also following [widespread concern](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/08/surveillance-security-review-lib-dems-gchq-snowden) in the Lib Dem party, Nick Clegg commissioned the RUSI ISR panel to review surveillance, which they've done, recommending significant changes, most of which agree with the reccomendations from the report from independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, David Anderson QC. The government has agreed to implement reforms based on those recommendations in the autumn, whereas this high court judgement allows DRIPA to continue until next march. Since the autumn reforms will be where the influential changes will occur that will set the tone for policy over the next few years, there is an argument that in many respects, the Lib Dem commissioned report will be more influential than this high court act which is more of a PR victory . Many high profile Lib Dems have also been preoccupied with EU stuff, many of them head up organisations like British Influence and other pro-In organisations, busy trying to make the case for British soft power and preventing the country shrinking into little England.

Some of the laws were intended to make the Israelites distinct from other nations (the food and clothing rules). None of the Old Testament law is binding on Christians today.

null,false,The_Silent_R,null,null,null,"With Sturridge out for the first three month and Benteke coming in to lead the line for at least that period if not partner with him. Of the strikers we have only two (Ings, Origi)  would be coming into another striker spot (if we play two) or replacing the lone man. So that give us four first team players, and two of which are under 23. Allowing us to be flexible in how we match against opponents. 

The midfield spots are very dependent on what formation we play. It may have two wingers and three CMs. We could play a 4-4-2 like we have been in preseason so only four positions for wingers and CMs to compete for. We may also dramatically switch back to a three back system giving us 5-6 midfield positions based off of strikers on the field. So the amount we have give us the flexibility to go between a few systems. 

The back line is almost set we apparently just need Moreno to get match fit for him to come into the fold. The order is up for debate but I would put Toure behind everyone except Gomez and wisdom( who are more full backs right now for us). If we play four at the back we would be fine with Moreno/Gomez out left sakho/skrtel/lovern/ilori in center defense and clyne/wisdom out wide. If we play three I wouldn't be surprised to see can ran out again. But that would have us playing players like clyne and Moreno in wingback roles with Ibe and other wingers. But the other players all give us similar qualities. Comfortable    on the ball CBs. All of which would be able to play the three back system. 

Overall I feel good with the depth we have. It will help us compete at a high level on multiple fronts (league, europa, FA and carling cups). We will be able to replace people with injuries. And if we keep anyone expected to leave I would like to see Balotelli stay, he gives us someone with a proven track record if he can figure it out again.

Ok man, I have some required viewing for you. And welcome aboard!!!

[Being Liverpool](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2289518/) - this is a documentary on the club a few years back, it gives some great insight to the club and what it means to be part of it

[The Miracle of Instanbul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxppRfepJtY) - one of our greatest moments in the history of the club. I watch it from time to time when I need a smile, good stuff.

[Friendly match down under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvYADPcqMXY) - a match down in Melbourne a couple years ago. The 95,000 seat stadium sold out and you couldn't find a supporter of the host team anywhere in sight. When the full crowd sings YNWA it brings a tear to my eye every time. Dear God this gets me going...

[Hillsborough](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3468534/) - lastly, but certainly not leastly, I give you Hillsborough. My friend if you plan on being a Liverpool fan you must know this story, and know it well. It's more than just a tragic incident, it's the heart of Liverpool ever since it happened. Assuming you don't know about it, we played a match several years back and as a result of a lot of screw ups by the police mainly, 96 fans lost their lives. The story is terrible and gets worse when you hear the truth behind what happened. And it's STILL not over. ESPN did a 30 for 30 documentary on it last year and it's wonderful. I highly recommend you watch it. It's important.

null,false,lclear84,null,null,null,"I'll try to sum up recent events in the briefest way I can.

So for the 13/14 season, we went into it kind of disappointed with the summer. Luis Suarez was going to be suspended for a few games for a biting incident with Branislav Ivanovic of Chelsea, and we didn't really make any huge additions in the summer. We ended up massively over achieving that season by getting 2nd in the league, however still finished heartbroken as we watch the title slip away even though we were in the driving seat. What a year it was.

Then last summer happened. Suarez, as you may know was involved in another biting incident, only this time on the biggest stage. We felt forced into selling him, however received a staggering amount of money for the transfer. Then came the rebuilding process. We brought in a lot of young, mouth watering players with the money, however very little premier league experience. Also summer of 14/15 saw us bring in two strikers (Balotelli and Lambert) that really didn't fit our style.

14/15 season begins. After a short preseason because of the world cup, it was hard to gel all of our new players (10 in total for a fee in excessive of over 120M) and many of them struggled. We were a mid-table side at most midway through the year. Brendan Rodgers (our manager) then decided to make a radical change. We began playing a 3 center back system which is very rare in English football, especially when you push a CM back to CB. Even though we played many games with no striker (forgot to mention that for much of the year Sturridge was injured), and many people out of position (I.E. Lazar Markovic playing RB, Emre Can at CB) we went on an inspiring run that saw us come as close as 5 points away from regrasping our champions league spot. Unfortunately, due to a mix of a few important injuries (Lucas, Sturridge, Sakho) and the overlying sentiment that Gerrard was leaving so we have to play him week-in week-out we could not finish the job. To make matters worse, on the final day, we embarrassingly lost 6-1 to Stoke City, a notoriously poor side (although I have to admit, ever since hiring Mark Hughes have been increasingly impressive). This put Brendan Rodgers under major scrutiny.

**Where we are now:**

After that result on the final day, many of us Liverpool fans did not know what to do. We just lost our iconic captain Stevie G, and we just got thrashed by Stoke of all people. A lot of fans were calling for Brendan Rodgers to get sacked, especially since rock star Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp had just become available. The summer also escalated the conflict of the Sterling Saga. Raheem Sterling was one of our star teenagers. No matter what he did to us, it's hard to deny that this kid has bags of potential, however he wasn't handling it the right way. He requested to not be taken on the preseason tour in Asia, he was missing training sessions because he was sick. It was a terrible ordeal. Somehow we managed to twist Manchester Cities arm into paying us 49M for him, and now we've need to make the signings that count. After last summers youth project, Brendan needed to make some developed signings this summer because he can not risk another dud of a year. Frankly though, ever since we watched how he handled the Sterling situation, and how he's worked fast and impressively in the transfer market, he's winning some of our respect back over.

&gt;Oil and Gas industry receives direct subsidy for exploration totaling £400 million

No it doesn't, in your very own linked report, there's nothing but tax exemptions or tax reductions there. Reducing the tax you levy on a company (especially when it was about three times the normal corporation tax prior to the reduction) is not a subsidy.

When in actual truth, the FGM associated in the UK is primarily with African-born immigrants (not necessarily Muslims). There's been two articles published fairly recently in the news, this one about 50 girls being seen going abroad, and then another about two girls being banned from leaving the country for fear they're having the act committed to them. 


This is about as close as I can come to a source to back up anything I'm telling you. Unfortunately there are a lot of myths and misconceptions surrounding FGM, and there aren't many sources or many people educating about it, because people would ""rather not know"", but when it gets mentioned in the news, they suddenly act like they know everything.

Not a single fucking point you've made is correct.

Both gas consumption and gas production are falling whilst renewable consumption and production are rising. This is a decadal trend, UK gas production has been falling since 2000. This shows you are wrong.

Your new claim *'My original point, that wind companies, which generate electricity, are not competing with the part of the oil industry which generates gas is accurate.'* is **obviously bollocks** - of course they are fucking competing you moron, they both sell their product to the god damned generation industry - it's the gas producer's main business for the love of god, thats why the production/consumption trends reflect each other. Jesus!

The first paragraph of the report I linked to says this:-

&gt;UK Government has implemented massive subsidies to promote exploration and development of risky and unconventional oil and gas
in recent years, including deep-water offshore resources and
shale gas. 

Who the fuck does oil exploration - fucking Santa? - Oil companies.

* Coutinho, Firmino, Lallana, Ibe and Markovic.

That's 26 players. Looking at this you'd probably want to loan/sell another defender on the list and add another DM/CM since Lucas/Allen are relatively injury prone. Possibly a winger/AM if we're gonna use 3 regularly.

Gomez, Ibe and Origi wouldn't need registering for the league squad since they're U21 and Ibe would qualify for the Europa League B squad list so everyone would be eligible for all competitions.

null,false,Moolemon,null,null,null,"This is so early! But I guess it's great you're so excited for Edinburgh! :-) New year's is called Hogmanay in Scotland, and in Edinburgh there is a big street party with food and drink and live music, as well as a great view of the castle and the fireworks. 

If you don't want to shell out for that, the Links (golf course/park) has a good view as well, and there are a ton of people there watching and doing the countdown. 

If you're really struggling, all the clubs tend to do New year stuff, so if you want a dance around and some bad decisions, just head over to Hive!

What's your budget for accommodation? I hear a good hostel is Kickass Hostel, near the castle (as I live here I haven't stayed in any hotels or hostels!). If you want to go upmarket The Scotsman is meant to be lovely. Edinburgh is a small city so everything is in walking distance, usually. If a map of where a hotel is looks confusing, look at the postcode. It'll have ""EH__"" with numbers. The smaller the numbers, the closer to the centre you are. So any hotel with a EH1 postcode will be close to all your sightseeing!

Another thing about New year's is that our bank holiday doesn't just cover the 1st of January, it also gives everyone the 2nd off as well (most people need it!!). So just be prepared for things not to be open until the 3rd, and definitely check online first before setting off anywhere. 

I'm always so bad at advising tourists what they should see and do. Most people recommend Arthur's Seat but not in January. I'm just not really sure what will be open. I think tours of the parliament are super interesting (and not touristy because 99% of tourists don't seem to know we have a parliament!!), and the castle is great, though obviously flooded with tourists. The kilt workshop next to the castle is really fun. You can look at the weavers making the kilts, buy tartan and laugh at the awkward touristy family photos in traditional highland dress they have on display (or even get one yourself for £20!). The whisky experience is also interesting. If you like art, there is a great gallery on queen street called the portrait gallery. The building is in gothic style and stunning inside and out. And the cafe is amazing. Visit the shops on Rose Street, a cobbled street quieter than princes st. 

About the weather: Edinburgh tends to just get very cold in the winter. We haven't had snow for a few years now, but it often gets icy. Glasgow usually gets snow, but Edinburgh is just cold and usually windy. So bring something to cover your ears and a good pair of gloves with your coat and you'll be fine (it's probably similar in the Netherlands anyway). It seems like the most obvious thing in the world, but I see tourists visiting in *November* who didn't bring coats so they've had to buy one of those plastic poncho things! 

I'm actually visiting Amsterdam soon (1st of August I think), is there anywhere you'd recommend I visit or any must-sees? We have 4 nights there before moving to Hamburg!

As medics are saying ad nauseum in the media at the moment, putting more doctors on shift won't translate to a larger quantity of treatment delivered. It's a completely shallow commitment. It would be like telling brickies they had to work an extra day every week and expecting 20% more houses to appear. Doctors are one cog in a huge machine.

Having more consultants on out-of-hours won't add value unless there's a corresponding increase in other hospital services. More nurses, more physios and other therapists, more pharmacists. More scanners, more technicians in the labs and imaging departments. And with all these extra patients passing through the hospital there would need to be vast investment in discharge care e.g. rehab beds, social work, and community therapies.

I'd welcome a 24-hour NHS, but I don't think doctors can solve the problem alone. And I certainly don't think the answer is to milk more work out of the existing corps.

null,false,1000ft-Bear,null,null,null,"Hello! - I was in your position a few years back moving to Manchester after leaving Uni - here are my handy hints:

The later you leave it, your choice will become more restricted as you'll only be able to look at houses that are available immediately - meaning they have been on the market ages and no one has moved in yet - if there are many of those left (depends on demand in the area!). It's quite normal to put a deposit down and the move in date is a good month later (the landlord knows the current contract is expiring and puts it back on the websites in advance to have you lined up to move in as soon as they're out). 

If you want to move in in a month - you want to be looking already. You won't be forced to move in immediately unless you've chosen a place that's available immediately - as I mentioned earlier they're usually advertised in advance of being available to move in. Try to look for 6 month minimum leases if you can, because your first place in a new town is often not where you want to be long term. Once you've been there a few months you work out which are the nice neighbourhoods for yourself.

Start on Rightmove or Zoopla, restrict to the areas near your work and set your budget and see what's available. When you see some you like, you can call up or submit the online form to ask questions and book a viewing.

Living with others is much cheaper, but it's luck whether it will be an amicable bunch of friends-to-be or be an unpleasant experience to add on top of the stress of new job, new city. Don't assume you'll be living with people remotely like you in age, background, nationality, occupation, interests, lifestyle unless they've supplied details of housemates, even then, remember others could leave and new incomers take their rooms while you stay there. I house shared for my first 9 months and personally really hated it but I do have friends who had a good time and even stayed with the housemates after.

If you want to rent your own place, first have some money saved for deposit and the first month of rent, plus an extra months rent because it'll take a while for your first pay check to come through at the new job (usually between 2-6 weeks). As a general rule, aim to rent a third of your income. So if you're on £1200 per month, look for rents that are £400 a month. 

On top of that, your bills will come to about £120 per month depending on what insurance you get, whether you get super fast internet and tv, your power/water usage etc and which supplier you choose.

Don't forget Council Tax - unpleasant surprise for many recent graduates. It depends on where you live (richer neighbourhoods and feature buildings in the city centre pay more) but that's about £80-160 a month again going out.

So you're up to about £800 a month in outgoings now, leaving you about £400 a month for food and stuff. 

Obviously if you've got a car that'll make things more expensive. And if you want to actually put any money away for savings look for cheap council tax areas and definitely be looking to house share for lower rents. If you haven't got a couple of grand in savings/available overdraft and your new job is less than £25k p.a expect to be watching your pennies more carefully!",null,0,null,1437170482,null,0,false,0,ct72g20,null,t3_3dmdqb,null,t1_ct72g20,null,t3_3dmdqb,null,null,null,1437949050,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

I was on my own - was dropped off at the school in the morning and picked up in the afternoon.  It was a two-way process in many ways, with them checking me out as well as them trying to sell the school to me so that they could get the fees.

We're quite capable of being a prosperous nation without being tied down to a failing political project that's engaging in more and more unappealing behaviour in order to keep the 'European dream' alive.

* We don't need to be in a **political** union in order to trade with other EU nations. We should leave and negotiate our own tailored free trade agreement like countries such as Mexico have. We're the **fifth** biggest economy on the planet, the EU's biggest export market. Don't give me scaremongering nonsense suggesting we're incapable of doing this.
* Leaving the EU means we can retake our WTO seat and forge out own trade agreemeents suited to us, rather than having to have the EU create them on our behalf in such a way as to suit 28 different countries with different economies.
* We are one of three net contributors to the EU budget, meaning we get less from it than we put in. What's more, the better our economy does, the more we are expected to contribute, despite the EU trying to impose measures that damage our biggest industries such as the Financial Transaction Tax. We're even expected to contribute to things that have nothing to do with us, such as Greece's third bailout, as has been revealed in the last week.
* The EU is pushing for the UK and France to give up their UNSC seats so that the EU can have one. It's already established what is effectively a foreign minister, and Juncker the Commission President is pushing for an EU army.
* The EU's obsession with expansion is creating a more unstable world. If the EU was truly interested in peace, it would have recognised that reaching out to Ukraine and welcoming the idea that it join the EU would provoke Russia into action. The last thing Russia wants is an expansionist pseudo-super power encroaching on its border. Yes I know there are entirely valid arguments for self-determination, but from a peace perspective these titans of the political scene should have recognised the consequences of their actions.
* The nature of the EU means we impose tariffs on goods from other areas of the world, which is morally questionable when you think of the impact it has on poorer countries like those in Africa.
* The EU is heading in one direction, and that is toward a federal Europe. The Euro is a disaster, but rather than admit it Europhiles are doing all they can too keep the dream of a federal Europe alive, even if it means ruining the lives of its citizens, or stealing directly from their bank accounts. See: Greece and Cyprus.
* The EU has a worrying distaste for democracy when it goes against the 'correct' result. The constitution was rejected by referenda in multiple countries, so it was rebranded the Lisbon Treaty (it is essentially the exact same document, I believe a study showed it had 94% of the content) so that it could circumvent national referenda (See: Valery Giscard d'estaing's comments on the matter), and when Ireland who did have a referendum on it rejected it, they were forced to vote again until they gave the 'correct' answer.",null,1,null,1437171553,null,0,1437175138,0,ct731y6,null,t3_3do85c,null,t1_ct731y6,null,t3_3do85c,null,null,null,1437949503,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Also, you're assuming that these overpayments are from bus drivers making mistakes. Do you not think a fairly hefty amount of it perhaps comes from people with incorrect change?

Vanguard focus on managing funds and don't want the administrative hassle of dealing with a ton of customer accounts and providing an interface for everyone to login and trade, so they're only interested in you if you have a *big* investment to make.

But a broker ([see anyone on this list](http://monevator.com/compare-uk-cheapest-online-brokers/)... although for small amounts you probably want to scroll down to the 'percentage fee' section) is absolutely in the business of providing a ton of customer accounts and a trading interface and doing all the admin to make that happen - that's their *thing*. So, for a small fee on top of Vanguard's fund charges, they'll let you invest in just about any increment you want; each broker might set some minimums, but if you ask their support people directly those sometimes turn out to be ""guidelines"" rather than actual enforced minimums.

Really, I think there's a fair bit to be said in favour of conventional annual leave arrangements being introduced in schools.  Everyone else - including healthcare and emergency services staff - can take leave whenever they like unless it's a peak period like New Year's Eve.  In schools, even non-teaching administrative staff and janitors etc. don't get free reign over their holidays.

When I was off school because I was ill, I caught up when I came back.  It worked fine, therefore pupils can take a day or two off no problem.

Surely teachers can take a week off and have someone cover for them?  Or leave a plan in place for the other teacher to pick up?  It's okay for teachers to be ill or take maternity leave, but not okay for them to take a short break from a stressful job?

It could even be restricted to a few days per term.  Obviously, parts of the school year would have to be protected i.e. no leave permitted within one month of exam season etc.

I like your point, but it's still a massive understatement. It happens in **barely** any Islamic countries, and is primarily in countries that are **majority** Christian or some other religion. 


However, even if it does take place in Islamic or Christian countries, it is not a religious practice. The Qu'ran doesn't mention it, and obviously neither does the bible. It is primarily a traditional/tribal practice that has been going on for years.

As others are saying, you will be travelling down the East side of the country which was in  its time heavily raided and influenced by Vikings, especially Danish ones, and was indeed called the Danelaw.

Yes, on the way down, Durham is lovely, and before that, right by the A1, there is Holy Island (once raided by Vikings, of course), reached by a causeway - some nice castles around there- Bamburgh, Alnwick. Just after you pass Newcastle, you see the Angel of the North on the roadside (on the left, but you only get a good view if you turn off and park beside it.)

further south, Yorkshire Dales are nice if you have time, especially Swaledale and Wensleydale. You can have a good tea with cheese in the Creamery at Hawes in Wensleydale. York itself has the famous Viking museum as well as York Minster. As people have said, Betty's is a Yorkshire institution, a Swiss-Yorkshire teashop like a continental Kaffeehaus i.e. serve same full menu all day.

* Focus on liberal values, as opposed to criticism of other parties 

* Trying to demonstrate distinctiveness from Labour and Conservatives, describing them as both ""small 'c' conservatives"" with vested interests. 

* Heavy praise for both his opponent, Norman Lamb, and Nick Clegg, as well as general praise for the Coalition

* Focus on regaining power 

* Heavily interested in decentralisation of power (which has been distinctive Lib Dem policy ever since the Orange Book)

* Targeting next year's local council election 

* Praises individualism, entrepreneurship and criticises unnecessary state interference. (All tenets of right wing, neo-liberalism)

* However, extremely heavy emphasis that poverty and dependence destroyed freedom. (The defining characteristic of new-liberalism, the left wing branch of the ideology). 

Other themes which were touched upon 

* Housing (wants more housing to be provided, mentioned several times)

* Immigration 'blessing not a curse' (mentioned at least twice)

* Praises Tolerance (mentioned about four times, possibly more, emphasising difference aspects of tolerance in different parts of the speech)


---

All in all it was a very promising speech. He's obviously positioning himself now as the leader of the whole party, not just his branch. The issues he brought up are extremely hot button issues of the moment, and place the Lib Dems as the polar opposite of (small 'c') conservatism, especially as found in UKIP. Even the branch of liberalism that Farron is shifting the party away from the types of liberalism which have had influence over UKIP and the Conservative Party. So he seems to have located the party on a firm footing in terms of policy, which will allow them to regain their distinctiveness, rather than just being ""the party which was in a coalition but now isn't.""

As an aside, he does seem to be a reasonable good public speaker. That does need to be tempered with caution though. He wasn't perfect. He's much more charismatic than the Labour leadership candidates, and his accent and at least demonstrating that he has a sense of humour make him much more human, but his jokes were often a little off and he seemed to have difficulty reading the crowd. Not bad, but, he's not Winston Churchill either. 

Interestingly, no mention of his christian faith. Would have liked to hear about that a bit, but oh well. He's obviously trying to down play it. That was the only real ""elephant in the room"" typed topic. He abstained on the Equal Marriage vote, and there's a few other strange blips in his personal voting record. That's obviously one of the Lib Dem's main achievements in government. A majority of Tory MPs voted against the motion, and they would never have put it on the Parliamentary time table if the Lib Dems weren't part of the government. It's really something that they can shout about, but if Farron doesn't feel he is able to because of his personal abstention and uncertainty on the grounds of his faith, then that's going to somewhat shoot the Lib Dems in the foot at a time when they need all the ammunition they can get (which makes it doubly worse that they're wasting it on their own feet).

Apart from that, I think this speech was very clear of the sort of leader Farron wants to be, and it looks promising. I look forward to seeing him campaign in the local elections and seeing him speak in Parliament now that he's leader.

Currently, you would be lucky to get an appointment from referral to a gender clinic within a year (the legal requirement being 18 weeks), and only then can you start the process of assessment to receive any sort of treatment. They require a minimum of 6 months of 'Real Life Experience', and the absolute (very unlikely) minimum of 2 lengthy and actually quite stressful examinations of every aspect of your life, before they begin drafting (seriously, I think they write a word a day) a letter to your GP recommending they refer you to an endocrinologist for blood test to check hormone levels in preparation for HRT. The difficulty before this point is getting around what's called 'gate-keeping', where certain doctors will withhold treatment if you don't exactly fit their gender stereotypes, so anyone outside of the mainstream will likely struggle (yes, butch trans women and effeminate trans men also exist).

The road to surgery (not just the minimum of 2 years 'RLE') is a much longer story, and things like laser hair removal and vocal therapy are practically mythical.

null,false,Bosola,null,null,null,"&gt; Too much salt causes high blood pressure

This is a familiar assertion, but the evidence seems to be weak. Consider the abstract of one of the 2011 Cochrane reviews, a meta-analysis of eight studies with around seven-and-a-half thousand participants:

&gt; Dietary advice and salt substitution did reduce the amount of salt eaten, which led to a small reduction in blood pressure by six months. There was weak evidence of benefit for cardiovascular events, but these findings were inconclusive and were driven by a single trial among retirement home residents, which reduced salt intake in the kitchens of the homes.

The other review's conclusion was much more forthright:

&gt; we do not know if low salt diets improve or worsen health outcomes.

But that's not all. There's evidence that cutting salt can in fact *increase* mortality in patients with congestive heart failure (who you might well expect to gain the most from salt reduction). For example, a 2008 [Italian study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17688420) with 230 participants with CHF found that reducing salt *increased* hospital readmissions.

Now, there do indeed seem to be patients who should avoid salt. Patients with chronic renal conditions might be wise to do so. Still, I think we can say that the situation is not quite as straightforward as much of the salt reduction literature suggests.",null,0,null,1437173988,null,0,1437174749,0,ct74ew4,null,t3_3dlrl1,null,t1_ct74ew4,null,t1_ct70i2l,null,null,null,1437950570,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The Being Liverpool documentary series is a bit odd, but it covers a really important period of transition for the club and is important for how we've arrived at where we are today, as well as providing a bit of history and insight into the background of the club. I would definitely recommend that to get you up to speed.

Oh, and watch this for the 13/14 season.

It was a magical, joyous time that ended in the bitter heartbreak of ""slipping up,"" quite literally (unfortunately) just shy of our first Premier League title since the league's inception in 1992. Memories of that season are some of the most bittersweet in recent memory, and fairly defining of life as a modern Liverpool supporter.

Also be sure to watch the video and story behind Istanbul in 2005, which is possibly one of the greatest nights in sporting history.

During the period when it was used with the Pledge of Allegiance, it was sometimes known as the ""flag salute"". Later, during the 1920s and 1930s, Italian fascists and Nazis adopted a salute which had the same form, and which was derived from the Roman salute. This resulted in controversy over the use of the Bellamy salute in the United States. It was officially replaced by the hand-over-heart salute when Congress amended the Flag Code on December 22, 1942.""

Ummm so? You say that as if people who supported the club before we were bought are better and know better than most. I grew up a mile from the bridge supporting Chelsea and I think it's fine for people to wear fake shirts if they want. Does that make me less of a fan? According to your logic it does. Who cares if you started supporting Chelsea 20 years ago or 2 years ago. People can support this club just as passionately as anyone who's family has been supporting the club for generations. That's the great thing about being fan, the simplicity of supporting the club and loving it's colours with anyone else who happens to love the club. Why do you care if those colours are being represented on a shirt missing an adidas logo? How does it affect you or anyone else? It doesn't. 

How are you not supporting the club if the fake shirt you're wearing is essentially made in the same factory? by the same people? with the same materials but the only difference is it's missing a few details or an adidas logo? It's just.. a shirt. The point of football shirts is to show your allegiance.. if you make your own shirt, buy a fake one, buy a retro one or the brand new one, it doesn't make a sodding difference. Your still supporting the club in your own unique way.

Congratulations though. This 'concept' is exactly how adidas and the clubs marketing department wants you and everyone else to feel. It's just modern day corporate tactics which you've bought into whole heartedly.

Lectures wise, we had like 10h a week on a very busy week, and a practical for 5h like every fortnight?

Coursework there is like 4 modules? The immunology one is a bastard, almost as much as the guy doing that module he seriously was the worst lecturer there. There is also a group poster, where you get given some data and have to do a bunch of mathematical tests, and then print it and present it after all your exams... is pretty easy, unless your team don't work together, there were 3 of us in a team, and 1 of them was pretty useless for me...

Exams there are 3, one is the 4 compulsory modules, which is like 3h, then your two options, 2h and then an exam that will contain stuff from the previous year and that year (you see the question a week before) you are marked on having one clear argument the whole way through, and using stuff from lots of modules, think that was like 2h30

Teixeira isn't on your list either, although at this point if I were him I'd look to transfer out rather than going on another pointless loan as he's unlikely to get a look in and agreed some (like Ojo or Rossiter) may go out on loan.  I also suspect we're not going to be able to offload Balotelli, so likely we'll do what we do and send him on a loan to buy somewhere and have to deal with him next summer.

Regardless, even with just the above it's a lot of players and at least 8 of your list will be sat in the stands every game and a fair amount of them will be lucky to play more than 500 minutes next season and many will be under 1000.  

Looking back at the Chelsea side from last season, they had 18 players play over 2,000 minutes as I recall and little else outside of that core group.  Mourinho has often expressed that he doesn't want more than 18 or so as it disrupts the team to have to make so many changes to accommodate everyone and frankly I agree with him.  If we play say 50 games next season, that's 45k minutes of outfield playing time.  If you break that out evenly (which it wouldn't be), that's about ~1800 minutes each.  Last year, as an example, Ings played over 3000 minutes in the league for Burnley.  Do you think he'll be happy at less than 1000 next season?  Markovic, Ings, Origi, Ilori, and even Gomez all used to be regular starters for their old clubs and I think it's going to be difficult for them to play bit parts.  Last year Lucas pushed for a move away once he was sat in the stands for the beginning of the season and I could easily see us in a similar position with a fair number of the people you listed above next summer for the same reason.",null,0,null,1437175103,null,0,false,0,ct75066,null,t3_3dnooi,null,t1_ct75066,null,t1_ct71zuw,null,null,null,1437951027,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Oh well, that's that then. Let's forget what the data shows, and the pollsters say (lol joke about not trusting polls), and what people's personal experiences are. 

We lost 4 million voters under Blair. They're not coming back if we're just a little more like the Tories. That's a fantasy. To imply that the only places on the left are the Greens is just cartoon politics. By far the biggest chunk of the electorate is not tribal first of all, they want people and policy that they buy into, not Left/Right. That's for the (tiny) minority who join parties and inhabit parts of the internet like this. Getting fixated on left/right is a sure fire way to miss the point and where the electorate are.

Secondly, you assume the Lib Dems and UKIP are right wing, when in many of their more popular areas they are further left than Labour have been.

The data shows we lost because we didn't convince the vote to come out and we didn't target the Lib Dem losses as well as the Tories (plus some well played electioneering and a terrible campaign from us, and I say that as a Miliband fan).

* 1984 - parents bought family home for £69k
* 2006 - family home is sold for £675k

And that wasn't even the most expensive part of town.  Even in 2006 there were other homes like mine in other areas that were easily worth £700k+.

There is certainly no way in hell my parents could start over right now with that house and that lifestyle I took for granted in the 90s as a child.

I will never own a house like that, nor will my kids ever attend a private school.  It was near effortless for my parents in the 90s and my dad - as sole breadwinner - claims to have been earning something like 44% of what he does now (although I don't have exact specific figures).

Put simply, I can't provide for my own kids what I grew up with and will never be able to.

You can also copy and paste that shit into application forms since they follow the general layout of a CV with the sam information.

I mean they pulled the oldest trick in the PR handbook during WWI when they simply changed their name to move away for their German ties, and it's well documented that Edward VIII was a Nazi sympathiser so this shouldn't come as a huge surprise. As someone commented above this could have been done as a way of teaching the children courtesy when around Nazi guests. They've done a good job of making people forget (or at least not associate it with the current Royal Family ignoring Prince Harry dressing as a Nazi) that there was a time when the Royal Family acted in this manner.

Volunteering is a good way to get experience, but it won't pay bills. You'll get a good reference though. You can volunteer literally anywhere. Depending on your age, volunteering at say.. a homeless charity or something like that will get you more experience than you can put on your CV. 

Go through the job description that they put up with the application - go through each bullet point and show that you can do this or have done this somewhere else. For example, team work is on practically every job description out there - when did you last work with other people to achieve something? Doesn't have to be job related and employers you're targetting will acknowledge this because its a low end position and they expect young people with no work exp to apply. Retail and catering jobs don't want aul people (&gt;21), they cost more to pay and are more likely to get fed up and leave. 

A lot of employers put up ""1 years experience"" so they don't get overloaded with applications, its about weeding out people who aren't suitable, it doesn't mean you can't apply. Its different if they ask for 2+ years experience. I've a mate whos a manager at a large clothing retail store and he gets about 4000 applications for each job - half go in the bin because they aren't signed, the rest are sorted to criteria but he will keep good applications that don't have experience but show some sort of intelligence and motivation.

That doesn't mean they're responsible to them. Indeed, if you're a Conservative in a Labour stronghold or vice versa, your MP will not represent you. He might not even represent you as a Conservative/Labour voter. 

&gt;voting in Parliament

This is not a responsibility. You're not held directly responsible for your voting record in almost all circumstances (most people won't even know what their MP voted for, and it'll usually be a whipped vote).

&gt;Running an office.

That is an option claimable by expenses. You're not paid by the tax payer to manage an office. And most small office managers aren't on £74k.

&gt;Representing your party.

This has nothing to do with being an MP or the salary you take. You can be an MP without being in a party, and you can be expelled from a party and still remain as an MP. You certainly shouldn't be paid for representing your party by the tax payer (and you aren't).

Really, it's not the character so much as the writing that did it.

null,false,Lordzoot,eng-yorkshire,Leeds,null,"&gt;It's like you're completely ignoring that period where every poll showed a hung parliament with SNP holding the balance of power and Sturgeon repeatedly telling everyone the SNP would never put the Tories into government.

I'm not too sure what basis polling has in this argument? I'm aware of what the polls said, but the polls were wrong. 

&gt;I'd say the fault lies with Labour, not the SNP's existence. If they had message that was distinct enough from the Conservatives' that the choice between the two didn't the amount of influence the SNP had, maybe they'd have stood a chance?

I deem this unlikely. The only way Labour could be different would be by going more left wing, which is almost certainly a vote loser. The government held the moral high ground with respect to economic policy, and Labour had to join them on it (it's almost impossible to win a modern election in any other way). Labour strategists aren't stupid in that regard. The SNP had the benefit of being the protest vote this time around. 

&gt;That wasn't me.

In that case, apologies, getting confused on the reply front.

&gt;There isn't an alternate universe in which the the SNP would have put the tories into power had they had the balance of power. It'd have been political suicide. The SNP made a hung parliament more likely, but not the a Conservative government in the event of a hung parliament more likely.

I don't mean the SNP would ever outwardly support the Conservatives. If you accept they made a hung parliament more likely, it sounds like you're saying that you agree that they took away Labour support in England, in which case I'm uncertain how you suggest that it didn't make a Con government more likely. 

&gt;Most of the votes the SNP gained came from Labour, do you really believe that line of thinking was common amongst SNP voters?

Some (bearing in mind 47% of people voted for independence, or something like that) but, no, not all. Most voters don't actually think about what they're doing, really. Some will have been protesting Labour incompetence in Scotland, others will have been following the political weather. If voters had thought voting SNP would usher in a Tory government, I doubt they would vote for them (unless they saw it as a long aim to independence). 

&gt;They thought they could drag Labour to the left, which they might well have done.

I don't think they did. No major political party is going to be moved left when it would be a net vote loser for them. If Black did personally think that, she's exceptionally naive politically. But I doubt she did.

&gt;They've provided a clear anti-austerity message, and now one of the leading candidates in the leadership election opposes austerity. Labour didn't provide a clear anti-austerity message in the general election and likely wouldn't have if the SNP hadn't existed.

They wouldn't have run an 'anti-austerity' message if the SNP hadn't existed, but they probably would have either got a hung parliament or a Labour minority with their manifesto. For the record, Corbyn will not win the leadership election and it'd be electoral suicide if he did. A lot of people in the country were actually in favour of the Conservatives cuts last time round - there isn't a desire amongst the population for a left wing candidate.

&gt;They campaigned on the premise that they would be able to drag Labour to the left as opposed to Scottish Labour MPs having to follow UK Labour's party line, which evidently relied on people willing to vote UKIP &amp; conservative.

That's not actually addressing my point that they don't have any power - either to drag the Labour party to the left, or to combat the Tories though.

&gt;Again, not me.

Indeed!

In general I also take issue with: a) stress - being an MP isn't actually stressful. Backbenchers have a lot of free time (even politicians have stated this) b) inflexibility - the job is actually relatively flexible. No less than most others, anyway c) insecurity - most workers don't actually have job security. People aren't paid more just because their job isn't secure. An MP is in place for at least 5 years once elected, and I believe they also get a golden goodbye. d) we choose them. This argument makes sense until you look at it closely, because we don't. The political parties choose their representatives, and then we choose them at elections. But we don't know anything about them really - most candidates are chosen by political affiliation alone.

&gt;My position on MP's pay, which was afterall the root of this discussion is that IPSA should set a sensible benchmark level (which I believe was what this recent change was about) and then every year from that point on it should rise at the same level (percentage) as average wage changes. Legitimate expenses should of course be allowed, as they are in many jobs.

Theta means ""temperature"". Sigma means ""the sum of"".

A Time Lord's average internal body temperature is 15 degrees Celsius, or 59 degrees Fahrenheit.

Adding 59+15 gives us 74. OR, 5+9=14, OR 1+5=6. ANOTHER OR, 14+6=20. YET ANOTHER OR, 7+4=11.

Going back to the whole Greek thing, 74 is εβδομήντα τέσσερα (Pronunciation: evdomí̱nta téssera), 14 is δεκατέσσερα (dekatéssera), 6 is έξι (éxi), 20 is είκοσι (eíkosi), and 11 is έντεκα (énteka).

But, the heart-wrenching orchestration Vale Decem had Latin lyrics. So, let's revisit that. 74 is septuaginta quattuor, 14 is quattuordecim, 6 is sex (Oh.), 20 is viginti, and 11 is undecim.

1) The original, ultimate motivation for a European community was to prevent war on the WW1/2 scale. On that front, so far, so good. Obviously that's a little weak as an argument, though.

2) Money. Yes, the UK can negotiate new trade deals. What would these trade deals mean? Deregulation &amp; liberalisation, the intensity of which would vary depending on whether the Tories or Labour are in power, obviously. What would deregulation and liberalisation mean? Well, ask British Rail. The general view is that firms are freer to squeeze as much bang for their buck out of the consumer as they can. Whether you believe that this transfers into increased quality probably depends on your political allegiances as much as anything.

2)(ii) Brexit means no more subsidies for British farmers. A generous free trade deal means that British farmers can sell their goods in more places, and more places can sell their stuff in Britain. Prices may go down or up, as may quality. 

3) Laws. The EU has been 'meddling' with the British legal &amp; financial system for quite a while. Prime example: having the temerity to [ban short selling](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-25845291), which either helped to reduced the likelihood of more massive crashes, or put an unnecessary muzzle on the City of London, depending on how you look at things. Maybe both. 

 Next, you're probably all familiar with this: The EU and UK have different views on who can and can't be deported or extradited. The EU generally favours the rights of the individual to a fair trial (or not to be tortured), while the UK feels that this can compromise national security. Case in point: [Abu Qatada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Qatada). He's a prick, obviously,  but the principle is sound in my view. The EU doesn't let you deport someone if they're going to face torture/inhuman treatment, or an unfair trial. 

The pro-brexit camp view the EU's definitions of inhuman treatment as being broad to the extent that it keeps knobheads like Abu Qatada in the country.
  The anti-brexit camp may well point to [the Soering case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soering_v_United_Kingdom), where the EU stopped the extradition of someone who was likely to face the death penalty. Leaving the EU means leaving all this legal waffle behind: you lose an additional layer of safeguards against being treated like dirt, but you gain more national sovereignty.








3)(ii) Free movement in the EU: If you're sick of Poles, Romanians, and paddy bastards like myself taking your jobs, vote out. Do bear in mind that immigration is [good for the economy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1114/051114-economic-impact-EU-immigration). Also, me mate's brother's ma's second cousin sells great carpets pal, if he can get into Britain then you can have a real cheap price, yeah?

A Brexit, to me, is Britain cutting off its nose to spite its face. I'd rather not trust the government to properly manage such a massive procedure. I also suspect a Brexit would only speed up Scottish independence. Lastly, if you vote out, you're doing something the daily mail approves of.

null,false,globaldu,eng-sussex,Sussex,null,"Many of us want to put in the hours, but it's becoming increasingly difficult to find full time contracts for unskilled positions. 

Low contract hours are beneficial to employers for several reasons:

. If one person on a 40 hour contract goes sick for a week you lose 40 hours... but if you employ two people on 20 hour contracts and one goes sick, you only lose 20.

. If one employee is a bit shit and another is good, you can keep the shit employee on contract and offer overtime to the better employee. 

. Overtime during busy periods but the ability to return to contract hours when there's less work to be done.

. When an employee quits you're only down 20 hours until you find a replacement, not 40.

When I left school, many, many moons back, I walked straight into a retail position. 40 hours per week, 9:00 - 5:30, 5 days per week, 30 minutes unpaid lunch.

My son, who left school last month and is going back in September, struggled to get a 15 hour position in retail, 12pm - 5pm, 3 days per week, despite wanting to work full time. 

IMO it's bullshit, employers shouldn't be allowed to get away with it, especially zero hour contracts, and these ""top economists"" are just spinning it to make it sound more appealing to the middle class.

But Delph, aside from the whole 'loyalty' business, was absolutely our best player last season and he reason both Benteke, and Villa, managed to hold on premier league football. Every highlight you watch, he's there. He contributed so much to the team, and you could just tell his performances as captain were motivating the whole team.
This is horrible time for Aston Villa, but I agree, there will be a silver lining that will emerge. What I think it will take, however, is for another couple of players to step up and shine. My bets are on Clark, Gueye and Gil. But in the meantime, Villa has lost some of the shine that began to show at the beginning of the season.

So... let's say we implemented the cut down to a 20 hour maximum, and then everyone just started being more efficient with their time at work; fitting the 3 hours worth they actually get done into a 4 hour day instead of 8.

Then employers would have been gifted a perfectly logical reason to cut everyone's pay up front because they're only asking for half as many hours, but many might not turn out to need to employ very many more people, unless the work is genuinely time-dependent. Which sounds like a pretty big win for employers as a group, and potentially another step along the path of degrading the job-security and living standards of employees.

08/09 season, we came close to winning the league for the first time since 1990... the first time in 19 years. We came in second to Man U, then things fell apart. This is where our transition begins.

The departure of a few key players and the rise of a few other clubs led to a season where we finished 7th in 09/10. Benitez was sacked that summer, and Roy Hodgson (now managing the English national team) was brought in for the 10/11 season. 

Now, during all this time, you have to keep in mind the role of our owners, Hicks and Gillet from Texas - you might know Hicks as a business tycoon from Dallas, who owns a few sports teams in Texas.

By this point, due to a series of some questionable financial tactics (for example, taking on high-value, high-interest loans by using the club as collateral...), Liverpool were nearly on the verge of administration. This means Liverpool were unable to pay our debts. Going into administration has disastrous implications; an outside accountant/administrator will come in to balance the books no matter what, and usually results in a wholesale exodus of players. On top of that, there is a points penalty. So with days remaining there, FSG came in and bought up LFC. This is where our transition seems to have rounded the corner.

Having rid of Hicks and Gillett, FSG had more problems. The new manager, Hodgson brought with him a series of disappointing signings and a flaccid playing style... which led to his sacking by January. Kenny Dalglish, a Liverpool legend, was assigned to take over the rest of the season. He brought in Luis Suarez and Andy Carroll following the departure of Fernando Torres, and there was reasonable improvement. The team finished 6th.

Despite the everlasting optimism of our supporters, our 11/12 season didn't go so well either - eventually Dalglish was sacked and Brendan Rogers brought in for the 12/13 season.

13/14 saw Liverpool finish 2nd - the highest since 08/09, and our first qualification into the Champion's League. This was in no small part due to the talent and industry of Luis Suarez, who was partnered by Coutinho, Sterling, and Sturridge.

Suarez left that summer, and things seemed to fall apart. 14/15 saw Liverpool falter to the finish in 6th place, despite some encouraging signs at the turn of the year.

That brings us to now. The loss of Luis Suarez and the attempts at building a dynasty of players to add to the history of the team has resulted in this huge influx of new faces for this upcoming season.

Anyway. That's sort of what's been going on with the club. I would've written more and in better detail with more interesting language, but... I didn't feel like it.

null,false,SpaceboyMcGhee,,Misguided Glory Hunter,null,"Here's something to be optimistic about, I'm becoming more and more reassured at how well Sherwood is dealing with things this transfer window.  There was always a question how well he'd do when given the opportunity to sign players for himself, and frankly some of the players we've been linked with have been a bit scary to my mind and didn't seem like a good use of resources (Adebayor, Townsend, Begovic etc) . However, that was all speculation.. the two players he's actually signed, Richards and Gueye look like really reasonable promising purchases.. and Amavi sounds even better (although I'm still worried he won't end up joining, but that's not Sherwood's fault). 

On top of that you've got the fact that he seems to have reconsidered two of my main gripes with him thus far in his time at Villa, marginalising Gill and Guzan.. and I actually have to say at this moment in time I've got quite a lot of confidence in his ability to spend our newly found wealth. 

Lets remember, no one thought Southampton would kick on last season and look what happened! They even lost more players than us (albeit they were better to begin with but hush!) and still ended up having their best season in years. It's not even that incomparable a situation as we too now have money to spend and a decent lot of youth prospects to bolster the squad, and, one hopes, a manager with the courage to play them.  

If we can get a decent striker in (and lets face it, what's more exciting in football than buying a shiney new striker?!) I'm loving the thought of seeing a growing Jack Grealish and a settled and emboldened Carles Gill linking up to provide the bullets. 

I know a lot's still up in the air, but if all else fails think about this.. it could be so much worse, Lambert could still be in charge and we could be looking forward to playing turgid negative dross in the championship next season.

So in a sense every dollar you might have overpaid for Sterling, was saved with Delphs low price tag.

I wouldn't be surprised if someone in your front office connected these dots. After talking to Delph and factoring in Liverpool's Benteke interest Sterlings transfer would be the first domino to fall. You guys needed to get younger and more English.

null,false,throwaway_aak,null,null,null,"stop trying to gloss over this crime, and the crime of other Muslims as though it's naught but oppression and racism. Have you EVER complained that numerous articles about child-molesting Catholic Priests that mention their religion? No.  
Like the rapist discussed in this thread, those Priests are leaders in their faith. Their crime is, therefore, inextricably linked to their faith.  Yet, when it comes to a Muslim leader charged with being a rapist, you defend him by insinuating that the entire discussion is based on islamophobia. It's not evidence of his innocence which causes you to defend him but purely that he is Muslim. You'd prefer that a Muslim rapist were left un-challenged, than that any Muslim were accused of any crime, any time.  
It is people like you who give space and permission to evil, allowing it to fester and grow in your community until it owns you all. You're as bad as the (some) white people who blame all crime in their neighbourhood on black kids, while ignoring what their own brats are up to.  
Your attitude is exactly why rape gangs and terrorism take hold...because people like you defend the indefensible so long as it's done by a fellow Muslim who you prefer over white people.  You are the racist here and the sad thing is, that the damage that your racism causes affects everyone across society.  
This is exactly the OPPOSITE of demonisation of Muslims by others.  It is the WORSHIP of Muslims - by you.  Stop worshipping other men. All men have the capacity for evil, whatever their religion, and all religious leaders represent their religion. They ESPECIALLY must be held to account because what they do reflects in other's experience of YOUR GOD. So, if you love your god, instead of defending them, hold to account those in your community who besmirch it  with their actions. Support society's attempts to police and to administer justice instead of acting as if Muslims are gods, incapable of crime and unanswerable for their sins.",null,0,null,1437194646,null,0,1437216899,0,ct7ep3s,null,t3_3dmhlp,null,t1_ct7ep3s,null,t1_ct7bprd,null,null,null,1437959236,null,4,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,4,null

Lambert and Borini will both likely be gone this window and I suspect a Balotelli loan in the future.  

Rossiter, Ibe and maybe Origi should be loaned out this season.  Origi probably in the second half of the season if Sturridge can come back healthy.  While Ibe shows great promise he still lacks some finer points to his game, something a loan spell would help.  Rossiter is 19 or 20 and as a CM he will probably go to a Champo side.  All loans would have an emergency loan cancellation for injuries obviously.  

Lucas and Sturridge, unfortunately, can't seem to stay fit for a full season.  Allen seems content to be a bench player, and a damn fine one at that.  

So really the pool is much shallower in a 4-2-3-1 or 4-5-1

Striker (1 position): Ings, Benteke, Origi, Sturridge (injured until Oct., won't be match fit until 2016)

Attacking Mids (3 positions):  Coutinho, Firmino, Lallana, Milner, Markovic.  With Lallana usually being subbed and Markovic being raw.

Central Mids (2 positions) Lucas, Can, Henderson, Allen.

**Which resonates with questions raised in the Australian Federal Parliament in 1963..**

&gt;Re what had occurred at a remote aboriginal community, shortly after Queen Elizabeth visited the Flying Doctor Base at Alice Springs, [March, 29, 1963.](http://i1.minus.com/i79hD8o9sdZoQ.jpg)

&gt;Some time after her visit images that appeared to have been taken with modern circa 1963 photographic equipment, which resembled official police photographs, were passed from hand to hand at Port Augusta High School.

&gt;The one I saw showed an aboriginal girl of about 8 yrs whose body was severed completely in two, from about her breast bone one side to her kidney region the other.

&gt;The Northern Territory politician who raised the matter on a number of occasions in the face of hostile criticism, is thought to have met his demise at the height of the controversy, check Hansard.

&gt;&gt;**Edit:** At a game of football in Alice Springs in 1966, a middle aged aboriginal man approached the group I was with and told an identical story, that the Royal Party including the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had carried out a massacre at his home community.

&gt;&gt;His tale evoked memories of the photograph I had seen at school three yrs before, and of the news reports re the questions in Parliament .. he wandered thru the crowd telling everyone the same story.

&gt;&gt;A local bloke said he was on about the same thing all the time, and that he repeated the same material to everyone he came in contact with, the local consensus was that it was true, but in the absence of an official inquiry what the Hell are you gonna do about it.

**As well The Guardian should follow up on the matter of 17 yo Latvian [Alisa Dmitrijeva,](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=Alisa+Dmitrijeva+&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=eripVZTMJYGxmwWXm7iYCA) who went missing from her home in August 2011.**

&gt;Whose murdered body turned up on the Royal Family's Sandringham estate New Year's Day 2012, so where the ---- was Prince Harry!

Aside from Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Kurt Zouma I doubt they will feature any other young players.  Maybe John Stones if they pry him from Everton.  Chelsea buy first team players that are expected to start from day 1.  

One of the criticisms of Mourinho is that he doesn't rotate his squad as much as he should.  

While you can count on the squad being thinned down from before the season ends, through sales and loans, capable doesn't mean they should be starting.  

If you look at the post about depth [here](http://imgur.com/T4DpGe5)

Sturridge and Flanagan will be injured into the start of the season so it is unwise to count them 34-32

Ibe, Teixiera, Illori, Rossiter and Ojo will be loaned out in all likelihood.  32-27

Enrique, Borini, Balotelli and Lambert will be sold or simply not play any role next season 27-23.

That leaves other players like Wisdom and Gomez to be decided later.  

If you want to be a real stickler you could take Bogdan off the list as he is a backup.

I would recommend avoiding big finales or arc-ending stories until you've heard the build up to them.  *A Death in the Family* and *Lucie Miller*/*To the Death* are a couple of my favourites, but part of what makes them so great are the stories and character development leading into them.

There is little appeal to the majority of England for a trade union supported candidate. I don't think labour will ever get in power again with a left wing leader. Blairism and the Center ground is the only way labour will ever be in power again. It gave labour 3 election victories and it was only stopped by a crippled coalition government in the end. 

Though the narrative on the left wing is that the whole country hated Blair for the 10 or so years he was in power, the reality is clearly the opposite and the sooner the left wing can get over it, the sooner labour will be in power again. 

I imagine a trade union backed contender will win this round of leadership and we will lose the next election. Perhaps after that the party will realise they need to return to the only stance that gave them power in 40 years. If not, it's time a new party replaced labour and drop all connection to unions.

The games that they play are so that Jordan can get his friends ready for the serious games in England, and it's not very important who wins. Jordan's friend Mario has been having a bad time, and Jordan's Dad Brendan doesn't think Mario should play with Jordan any more, and Brendan hopes that somebody else's Dad will pay Brendan money so that Mario will play with the other Dad's friends somewhere else.

Remember the games where it doesn't matter who wins? OP was saying that Mario would play in those games, and that some of the other kids Dads might notice Mario and pay Brendan more money for Mario than if they only knew how Mario was playing when he was having a bad time in the serious games. We don't want to get our hopes up, even though we really like Mario, because he will probably go to play football somewhere else (maybe even in a different country), but some of us think it would be great if Mario played in these not so serious games and, even though they're not serious, show people that he's good enough to play with Jordan.",null,0,null,1437200881,null,0,false,0,ct7h1d8,null,t3_3domti,null,t1_ct7h1d8,null,t1_ct7gdun,null,null,null,1437961092,null,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8,null
