The thing is that the kid is 20 years old and it seems like people expect him to be world class. Like guys, take a fucking step back. Who is better than him in our attack? Or who has been better than him this season (in the attack). The only person would be Coutinho. So yes, lets sell our 2nd best player who has huge potential and we are relying to do everything for us. He is not a striker but has been put there because none of our strikers have been performing to what we expected. He is best at number 10 or winger rather than as a striker. 

Yes, he might not be performing as we are wanting, but you are not going to find a better player at his age. Might find more consistent players, but no one who have had his upside so far. The problem is that we are basically putting most of our faith on him. When last season Sturridge and Suarez did take most of the spotlight, this did help him develop as a player.

&gt;""Jim wants to contribute to ensuring we keep the Tories out,"" the source said.

&gt;Mr Murphy has come under pressure from the SNP to clarify his position after promising to announce his plans at the start of this year.

&gt;There was speculation he would step down from the seat to concentrate on leading Scottish Labour and preparing for next year's Holyrood election.

&gt;Mr Murphy has a large personal vote in the constituency, which could prove vital with his party trailing the Nationalists by 20 points or more in the opinion polls and facing heavy losses across the country.

&gt;He is now expected to contest a Holyrood seat at the next Scottish election.

&gt;Mr Murphy said: ""As I have said many times before, I am the Labour candidate for East Renfrewshire against the Tories in May and Labour's candidate for First Minister in 2016. We have had a really good response on the doorsteps in recent weeks.

&gt;""We need to do everything we can to stop the Tories being the largest party. I want to contribute to making sure the Tories are kept out of East Renfrewshire and Downing Street.

&gt;""The choice facing voters in East Renfrewshire is much the same as the one facing the rest of Scotland - it's between Labour and the Tories. Any seat the SNP take makes it more likely the Tories are the largest party and David Cameron returns to power by the back door.""

null,false,acidus1,null,null,null,"&gt; Nick Cohen seems to brush over the figures on this, how many ex-Muslims in the UK are killed or harmed for renouncing their faith?

[Honor killings do sadly happen in the UK,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Shafilea_Ahmed) (most of due to marriages/relationships but I won't rule out that an apostasy honor killing is impossible in the UK). It's harder to number the people harmed because I don't think they would come forward to the police, but again I haven't searched for numbers. They are rare but at the same time I don't really think that's meant to be the message of the article.

 It's not about the numbers, it's about the zeitgeist and beliefs in these communities who will turn on a person for simply changing their beliefs. If you family, friends and community will all turn against you at once for simply not agreeing with them, it does take a huge amount of courage to step forward and disagree. 

&gt; Hamza Tzortzis, a founder and leading speaker of [IEra](http://www.iera.org/about-us), was asked whether Islam condones a death penalty for blasphemy and apostasy. ‘Yes it does, yes,’ he replied, before going on to opine that beheading would be a painless means of killing ex-Muslims.

When the leader of UK register charities is saying things like that and isn't called out on it, doesn't that disturb you? Wouldn't you be fear full if you where hearing things like that? 

These people are very brave and we should do what ever we can to help them and to challenge the idea that apostasy should be punished.

You're trolling, but I'll take the bait.

As a member of UKIP, I believe that so-called ""bad apples"" need to be ejected. I was at an election meeting recently where a PPC called immigration a ""cancer"".

That guy got shot down big time. We don't need idiots like that in the party, and you can quote me on that if you like.

Younger UKIP party members like myself are steering the party to more liberal views and it is slowly working. https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=s4Fpe1MMlb4#t=322

You might be surprised to learn that half of the UKIP party members in my area are not white. This is not about race, just look at the racial makeup of the party and you'd probably be surprised. We have supporters who are from all backgrounds, people from other cultures who integrate and inherit British values, and skilled workers who come to Britain who provide skills that we are missing in our country.

I welcome immigration, but it must be controlled, else our country will continue to be overwhelmed.

It is a genuine concern that we cannot provide the infrastructure to support hundreds of thousands of migrants coming to our country with the NHS stretched to breaking point as it is.

As I said in the original post, before I had to delete it due to abuse by PMs and comments, I *am* a liberal member of the party.

I agree with many UKIP policies otherwise I wouldn't be involved, but I also disagree with some, such as the reduction of green energy. I am *for* green, renewable energy, but disagree with fracking, and am pro-nuclear.

Licence all breeders of pets, with spot checks.

Make it law that breeders must take back or help rehome dogs they have bred if their current owners can no longer keep them. Same with any dogs a rescue has rehomed.

That cuts way down on the number of new dogs that may end up in a shelter (since any decent breeder would take any animal they have bred back in the first place) meaning more space to keep those already there.



Stop shitty breeders being able to KC register dogs, puppies can't be registered unless parents have passed the relevant health tests for their breed (or at least bred affected/clear or carrier/clear), meaning they have less of a monetary incentive to be breeding in the first place.

Have a separate registry for crossbred dogs, still requiring generic health checks before breeding (i.e. hip/elbow scoring, heart/eye tests, patella grading), and relevant tests of parent breeds (i.e. tests for both Poodles and Labradors done for Labradoodles)

So crappy breeders go 'out of business' since the public know the reason their dogs aren't registered is because they're too cheap to do any testing. This has already worked in Sweden, so their stray/unhomed dog population is practically zero. And all while having spaying/neutering illegal except for medical reasons.





Edit: there's actually a rescue in Sweden taking in dogs from Ireland since there's so few in rescue there, while far too many here - http://www.hundarutanhem.se/Situationen-pa-Irland/

&gt;On 6 November 2006, *[The Invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invasion_(Doctor_Who\))*, an eight-episode Second Doctor serial of which six episodes survive in the archives, was released on DVD with the missing Episodes 1 and 4 animated by [Cosgrove Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosgrove_Hall), matched up with a newly remastered soundtrack created from the extant fan recordings.  This was the first time whole episodes were completely restored to a release, with the intention that it serve as a prototype for future attempts to reconstruct full serials. On 2 June 2011, [2 Entertain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Entertain) announced on its @classicdw Twitter page that the missing episodes 4 and 5 of *[The Reign of Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reign_of_Terror_(Doctor_Who\))* would be animated for its DVD release. A test still based on an available promotional shot was also revealed and the company announced the animators to be Big Finish and Planet 55 Studios, using the ""Thetamation"" process.  It was released on 28 January 2013. On 15 February 2013, it was announced that Planet 55 would be used again to provide an animated version of Episode 4 of *[The Tenth Planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tenth_Planet)*; the release date has been confirmed as 18 November 2013.   It was then announced on 27 February 2013 that episodes 2 and 3 of *[The Ice Warriors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ice_Warriors)* would be animated by [Qurios Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qurios_Entertainment) for a 26 August 2013 DVD release.  In April 2013 it was announced that episodes 1 and 3 of *[The Moonbase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moonbase)* would be animated by Planet 55 for release on 21 October 2013; however, the release of *The Moonbase* was later put back to January 2014 to allow the animation work to be completed, with its place in the release schedule taken by *The Tenth Planet*.    As of 2013, each DVD release is budgeted to allow for the reconstruction of up to 2 episodes using animation.  In December 2013, it was confirmed that the missing episodes of *The Underwater Menace* would be animated by Planet 55; the release date was expected to be in early 2014.   As of October 2014 [update] however, there is no indication that this is the case, as both Planet 55 and the Doctor Who Restoration Team have stated that they were not working on the project.   In December 2014, the BBC released a statement reaffirming their commitment to release *The Underwater Menace* on DVD with animated reconstructions of the missing episodes, with a view to a release sometime in 2015.

I quite like the idea of temporary housing units set up in cargo containers or similar, but from what I understand the stuff thats has been tried in this country suffered from shitty build quality, as in its better than sleeping rough but actually a bit dangerous due to hold and damp problems(they are just big metal boxes). From what I've seen addictive drugs often have a hold on people prior to them hitting the streets, better rehab facilities  could easily provide the stop gap between homelessness and temporary housing for many people, but the temporary housing needs to be there for those who need it.

 If you look at how local authorities provide temporary housing these days, much of it is rented from private landlords, at extremely high cost, much higher than the equivalent private sector rent-the landlord gets his rent in full 52 weeks a year occupied or not in order to guarantee the availability and to keep the landlord sweet on the idea of 'undesirables' renting their property, the housing association gets their cut to cover maintenance which is normally provided on contract from a company making a tidy sum on it, in total from what I've seen this can double or treble the actual rent, the same applies to the costs of bed and breakfasts accommodation which is also often overused by councils.

&gt;Six ships have been ordered, and transfer of custody of the first happened on 10 December 2008.  The MOD's initial planning assumption was to procure twelve ships (essentially a like-for-like replacement of a similar number of Type 42s), with the size of the second batch to be determined between 2005 and 2010.  However this was reduced to eight ships in the 2003 defence [white paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper) entitled *[Delivering Security in a Changing World: Future Capabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delivering_Security_in_a_Changing_World).* It was reported in December 2006 that the last two could be cut.  In July 2007, Ministry of Defence officials stated that they ""still planned to build eight Type 45 destroyers"" and that ""the extra two ships were still included in planning assumptions"".  This plan was officially abandoned on 19 June 2008 when the [Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_State) for the Armed Forces, [Bob Ainsworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ainsworth), announced in [Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_England) that options for the seventh and eighth destroyers would not be taken up.   The continual scaling back of the project, first from twelve to eight, and subsequently to six ships, has been criticised for leaving the Royal Navy with insufficient ships to meet its requirements.

I went to the city center most nights for dinner and adult beverages. Really enjoyed the Standing Order and the Dolphin. Some of the other 'clubs' - meh. Had some decent Tikka and fish and chips in most of the many shops I tried. Happened to visit the cathedral while they were having a concert to celebrate Armistice Day. It was beautiful!
Had some awful sushi at the Blue Moon and the worst Indian food ever at the Indian restaurant in the Days hotel. Overall the food was much better than I expected, the weather was worse than I expected and the town seemed to ebb and flow with paydays more than I have seen in other places.
I was surprised to see women in short skirts and dresses walking around in near freezing temperatures. Every. Night.
I visited the big cemetery and was really fascinated by it; visited the 'gentleman's club' and was bored to tears. Just awful.
Weekends were fun to walk the outdoor malls and markets, weekdays they were like ghost towns. Didn't rent a car; everything done was by public transport or taxi.
Made a few new friends in Derby and had a good time; went to London, had a great time. Derby was a fine place, safe at night, nice cops, reasonable prices, easy to get around, good people. 
Lots more, but I don't want to bore anyone.

&gt;The FA Cup winners qualify for the following season's [UEFA Europa League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League) (formerly named the UEFA Cup; until 1998 they entered the [Cup Winners' Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Cup_Winners%27_Cup) instead). This European place applies even if the team is relegated or is not in the English top flight. However, if the FA Cup winning team has also qualified for the following season's [Champions League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League), then the losing FA Cup finalist is given the Europa League place instead. FA Cup winners enter the Europa League at the Group Stage. Losing finalists, if they enter the Europa League, must begin earlier, at the play-off or Q3 stage.  From the 2015/16 season, [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA) will not allow the runners-up to qualify for the Europa League through the competition.

null,false,DrBasedGod,lfc99,,null,"You got a couple flippant answers but I'll try at a serious one. The formation not only fits the players we have but also allows Brendao to incorporate his philosophy into our tactics. The beautiful thing about this 3-4-2-1 is that in defense if you look at the setup we actually look more like a 5-4-1. The wingbacks come back to defend and the ""2"" in the 3-4-2-1 drop back into a flat 4 in midfield.

3 at the back has benefited not only Skrtel but also Mignolet. Having Sakho and Can, two very good passers, on either side of Skrtel gives him an out ball on both sides. Instead of lumping it or panicking Skrtel has seemed way more confident laying it off to either side knowing that they can do something with it. Mignolet has an extra defender and the peace of mind that comes with that.

Those ""2"" behind the striker are the key to our offensive shape as well because they can drop deep to start attacks *without* losing a runner. Playing wingers as wingbacks allows you to drop Coutinho but still let Ibe run, so at any point in the game you're never being outnumbered in midfield but you're also not sacrificing attacking options/width to get that extra man.

We know Brendao loves having a man advantage in midfield and that's why his ideal formation would probably be a Barca-esque 4-3-3 with great short passers. Right now we actually play with more of a box in midfield which gives us 4 players in the center of the pitch *without* losing a man on the outside. Rodgers is still able to play with his philosophy while solving a problem (see also the diamond from last season. He found a way to get 4 in midfield while somehow keeping Suarez and Sturridge in the same side. This time around it was keeping 4 in the midfield and fixing the defense.)

I personally think Rodgers was brilliant to come up with this shit. No matter what you think of Brendao, the Emre Can move was objectively brilliant.

p.s. I think that we struggle way more to keep possession and generate ideas while playing 2 strikers in this system because we take that 4th option out of midfield and Hendo/Allen loses an out ball.",null,0,null,1425098906,null,0,1425099218,0,cozoph1,null,t3_2xdihz,null,t1_cozoph1,null,t3_2xdihz,null,null,null,1427498877,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

You are probably correct. I probably wouldn't want to be in an environment where I would feel like I was being abused.

&gt; But its all in good fun and as long as everyone understands that its fine.

While I totally understand what you mean, all it takes is *one person* to not actually agree to it but not feel comfortable expressing that to make things very dark. No one wants to be the person who gets blamed for ending harmless fun -- even if it does hurt them. This is especially true if outsiders are playing along just in order to get along with everyone else.

Your family could have it sorted out just dandy and that's great but I don't think that makes Amy's treatment of Rory any less abusive. And if you treated someone else that way it *could* be considered abusive.

&gt; And of course nobody gets hurt but it doesn't seem to me that Rory is constantly in pain because of the ""abuse"".

I really strongly disagree with the idea that it isn't abuse if it doesn't seem to be causing pain.

I also disagree that Rory doesn't seem to be suffering from it. I could be projecting how *I'd* feel in that situation but he constantly seems hurt.

I don't see how you could attribute any malice to Amy. People tease eachother. Girls hit their boyfriends on their arm sometimes. It's a form of affectionate physical contact. 

I suppose there could be said to be a double standard, but that's more dumb people wanting to jump to the conclusion that a man can never hit a woman, even slug her on the arm because chances are if she's your life partner then she's your best friend, too. Which means you'd do what best friends do. 

I'd slug it out with my girl. But then again the girls we got down are country as hell and can knock your dick stiff as easily as any man. But that's beside the point. 

It wouldn't be abusive either way. There's a difference between abuse (which, by the way, usually requires some sort of systematic quality I'm guessing) and Amy giving Rory a slap because she's upset or why the hell ever she slapped him, I don't recall. 

Anyone who says its abuse has never seen spousal abuse. I have, my mother was abused by my stepfather, and it looked nothing like a slap and a slug on the arm.

Yes the medicine they want give her would kill her but it definitely wasn't because they wanted to kill her. The opposite in fact. And something she figured out how to hide and disable on her first ""day"". Also in fact the only reason she has any trouble with them in the ending is because of her-young-self and Rory. If anything Apalapucia was a paradise, she just had to be sneaky. And now I'm just going into a lot of speculation.

But the point is Rory (even though he chose to) waited for 2,000 years to protect her and all Amy had to do was wait 30-ish years for Rory to come and save her.

* The Big Bang - 2,000 years
* Day of the Moon - A couple weeks
* A Good Man goes to War - several months

In which all of them he is either literally protecting her or braving just insane dangers to rescue her (and in the last two fighting things that are actively trying to *actually* kill him). Since they were little children he has been on and at her side constantly.

Honestly now that I think about it even more I actually kind of hate her for being mad at him. She literally has no reason to not trust for 100% certainty that he is doing everything in his power to save her. He even finds out that she tried to cheat on him on the **night before** their wedding (and actually did kiss the Doctor) and he still forgave her and loved her anyways.

Its exactly like when we had an avalanche of sitcoms (America at least, I can't speak to UK trends) that featured lovable dopey, unattractive, semi-emotionally abused husbands being controlled, belittled and emasculated by hyper-controlling, usually wildly attractive but altogether bitchy wives.  ie: king of queens, rules of engagment, The Honeymooners, Grounded for life, The Middle, Malcom in the Middle, According to Jim, Lucky Louis, The Drew Carey show,  Yes Dear, but MOSTLY Everybody Loves Raymond coming in as the worst offender.  

Even Friends plays on this trope with monica and chandler. Family guy and the simpsons attempt to poke fun at this phenomenon.
Its a very misguided attempt at writing a ""strong female character.""  It mistakes smart for bitchy, strong for needy, and leaves you with a very 2 dimensional uninteresting result.  

So is it sexist when people don't see Amy's behaviour on the show as abusive?  Absolutely.

Is it sexist that her character was written to be the gorgeous c**t that she was?  Yep.  That too.

null,false,MrGorewood,cnty-scotland,anarcho communism,null,"These are fair points, but I'd argue that this is a natural part of the building of justification for action in any ideology: state, national, religious or political. Western nations cherry pick too, and in taking our support for democracy for example:

 - Syria and Libya, popular revolts put down, democratic movements crushed - West and the media clamour for action, politicians call for action, indirect/direct support given.

 - Russia swings to authoritarianism. Criticised in media but no clamour for action. Democratic protests crushed and the indifference continues. Some politicians speak out. Only when our direct interests are touched upon (Ukraine) do we use any action.

 - Saudi Arabia, Zimbabwe and Bahrain (amongst others) crush democratic movements and protests and media covers it, but not even close to the same extent and no political commentary. Largely forgotten.

 - We invade in support of democracy or protect human rights selectively, based not on an overriding ideology but the immediate, normally realpolitik and economic needs.

To take a historical analogy, based on your use of the Crusades vs. Muslim Conquests:

 - many Brits will point to the spread of British democratic and jurisprudence to the Empire as examples of its good, while ignoring the destruction of culture, the subjugation of millions to minority rule and the thievery of natural wealth as negatives. 

Any group trying to justify their actions and history will build an ideology that supports their actions and beliefs. This is natural as there is a need to propagate and survive - a selfish meme if you like - and a need to avoid cognitive dissonance that can undermine a system like this. This leads to the creation of these incomplete truths and outright myths, spread through YouTube beheading videos and their accompanying preaching, or biased Fox News propaganda, normally grossly simplified to appeal to the baser emotional instincts of the viewer/listener and rarely made in a way that allows for critical analysis of the wider facts and context. 

A victim ideology is powerful. YOU'RE A VICTIM. When drones drop ordinance on a village, killing civilians, you must see how this happens, how this is a powerful truth and a blunt tool, and while not the whole story, is a contributing factor. Much as our WE'RE ENLIGHTENED BENEFACTORS is powerful in the West. It has its truth, but if we don't accept the inherit lies we're blinded to the whole picture. 

These common complaints from the Muslim world are never a justification for violence, especially against non-military targets, but they are part of the overall set of reasons for the violence, alongside religious fervour and grinding poverty for example. To ignore this, is to invite its continuation, and without accepting it, we will continue to make the same mistakes. Our own intelligence services said it. Iraq increased the level of terrorism in the Middle East and our likelihood of being victims at home.

In this particular case though, I'd call BS on what this CAGE group are saying. Whatever the reasons for his radicalisation, I doubt it was MI5!

Finally, just as Britain is not some homogeneous culture, neither are Muslims. We should avoid treating them, or any other group, as such. Judge the man, not the book he carries or the flag he stands beside.

I don't claim to be a professional in this, but, atleast for me, I can see how this easily came about. Men were always seen as the strong ones. The providers. The ones who can't cry or be broken by any words or emotions. If they were bullied or abused by a woman, then that's just downright embarrassing and emasculating. Hell, there's even thousands upon thousands, if not millions, of people *in this day and age* who completely believe it's impossible for a man to be raped by a woman. Regardless all the progress we've made this very extreme point of view still stands. There's absolutely *no way* any man could be raped by a woman cause, how could any man be overwhelmed by a woman?  If something that serious is still believed then even the most progressive politically correct people can't see any male/female relationship capable of having a female abuser.

You will never have any credit risk in relation to your student loan because the bank (well student loan company) can't come after your possessions or foreclose your house or anything like that.

For getting into university without any initial cash outlay I'm more than happy to pay it back over the rest of the years of my life however much it needs to be. 

The thing is however that reducing the tuition fee cap won't reduce the need for university funding. It's creating an illogical funding gap that will have to be filled from somewhere.

People love to be superprogressive and address how the smallest detail in the portrayal of a female character is wrong, dangerous and offensive (and many times they would be right), but nobody ever seems to bat an eye to a fact so serious as normalizing violence. Notice the word normalizing, it means ""to make normal"". It is culturally acceptable for a woman to hit a man. And super funny. Put it the other way round and everybody would go crazy, and not just tumblr or srs or whatever. And they would probably be right.

There was some videos on youtube, a casual social experiment of sorts, where they literally did this. They had two different couples arguing on the street. In one of the situations, the woman was berating the man and hitting him. Passerbys didn't do nothing other than laughing. In the other situation, the man was berating the woman (can't remember if he hit her), and everybody got involved, putting the man away angrily.

So, to answer the question: ""Why don't we see the abuse?""

null,false,ThatKaylaPerson,null,null,null,"TLDR; Amy isn't necessarily ABUSIVE to Rory. More of a brotherly/sisterly bond where they push each others' buttons.

I'm obviously going to be in the minority here and I sincerely hope that I don't get hate for this, but I'm not sure I necessarily agree. I mean, yes, there are times when she is obviously not a very good girlfriend/fiancee/wife. Kissing the Doctor when they're engaged, running off are just the first two that spring to mind. 

However, I would necessarily throw them into the category of abusive. I'll use the example of my own family, specifically my sister. I love my sister. Hell, I look up to her. She has done so much, pushes herself AND her boyfriend every day, works two to sometimes three jobs, school, and has her whole future planned out. She is incredible. I would say (in a vague way, mind you) that I would Rory out the two of us. My sister is clearly the Amy. Yet, when the two of us are together, we rough house, punch each other all the time, steal stuff from each other, run around the house chasing each other, call each bitch tits and buttholes and idiots. Nine times out of ten, she comes out the winner and I'm the one cowering cause she is wicked strong and scary when she's mad and quite frankly, her bad side is a place that I just don't want to be.

Now, do I, being the Rory between the two of us, classify all that as abuse? No. I love her, and together, we push each others' buttons. It's what we do. She tickles me to the point where I feel like I'm paralyzed, but I still get up and love her to death. I feel like that's the thing with Rory and Amy too. They push each others' buttons. Rory takes a lot, sure. The man has INCREDIBLE patience, the kind I would say is beyond anything shown in any other fictional character out there. He waited 2000 years after all. However, just because he takes all that from her doesn't mean he doesn't dish it back out. Sure, he loses a lot, like me, but like any relationship out there, you're not always going to come out on top.

Now, before it's said, I can already imagine one comment. I'm talking about my sister and myself, while Amy and Rory are in a romantic relationship, something completely different. However, I would like to point out that Amy and Rory basically grew up together, very much like siblings. Their relationship was just taken to another level higher than siblings. But the point remains the same.

Now, yes, imagining the two swapped genders, it would seem a little odd. Male!Amy would seem a little rough while Female!Rory would be pretty meek. However, again, to the point of abuse, I'm not sure I entirely agree. There is a very fine line between playful punches or calling someone out for a lapse of judgement and full out smacking them around or calling them a idiot with maliciousness in your voice. Perhaps it's just the actors and the way they portrayed it, but I never really felt like they crossed that line. Almost every relationship has that playful teasing. When looking at the relationship and only seeing those particular events, then yes, one could easily assume that there was nothing, but abuse. However, I think looking at it on the whole is what is needed. Amy's wanderlust definitely made her stupid at times and pretty cold towards Rory. However, in the end, her love won out, a love that never really went away I believe. And thank God for Rory's patience, because plenty of other people would just throw in the towel at the very first sign of trouble.

I would also like to make one last note to this post, because I feel like I can be accused of a lot and I'm trying my hardest to put this all into a perspective that seems understandable and not just some dumb bitch who thinks people whine too much. First of all, I myself have been through a particularly abusive relationship, one where I was made to feel absolutely worthless unless I was doing just exactly what the other person wanted. So, I'm not just talking my ass. Second and slightly less important, I'm in no way a lover of Moffat. In fact, if I'm being particularly honest, I kind of hate him. He can in fact be pretty sexist at times, especially with Clara, I hate the new direction he has been taking this newest Doctor, and quite frankly, I think he's pretty damn conceded. So, I'm not defending him at all. 

I will admit, perhaps I am defending the characters a little and perhaps I am biased. It wouldn't be the first time and definitely not the last. But the 11th Doctor was what I got into. He is MY Doctor and everyone seems to be biased to their first Doctor anyway. My sister adores 10 while I'm in love with 11 and Matt Smith's quirkiness. I just hope that people would look at the relationship as a little more as the three-dimensional creature that it is.",null,0,null,1425115025,null,0,false,0,coztd66,null,t3_2xe9fh,null,t1_coztd66,null,t3_2xe9fh,null,null,null,1427501067,null,-2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,-2,null

Remember hearing the government recently talking about ""metadata"" and how that's all they want and they currently can't get it? Well Snowden shows that's a lie and we've been collecting content for ages. Secret Services lied to the people to protect themselves. That is not the action of someone doing good.

That's all before you even get to the issue of whether any of this actually has a positive impact. Does it actually stop any crimes? And what crimes does it choose not to stop?

These are not decisions to be made by a few spooks on the fly, these are decisions to be made by the democratically elected parliament.

One final point: if you think that the worst this stuff is used for is ""enforc[ing] unjust laws"" then you seriously haven't been paying attention. If anything, enforcing the law is the smallest part of this things job. Mostly it seems to be titillation, illegal activity and harassing legitimate protest groups.

Edit: And another thing! :D (sorry, I feel strongly about this topic)

Terrorism is a tiny tiny tiny threat. In terms of deaths per year it's behind things like choking on biscuits and falling off ladders. The money we spend on it, let alone the changes to our basic social contract with government, is massively out of proportion to it's threat. Countries without this tech and without the size and power of our secret service are not constantly attacked by terrorists or other groups. This is about the political fallout of a scary, easily televised attack and the paranoia of people in power and nothing more.

&gt;

&gt;The __Lammermuir Hills__, usually simply called the __Lammermuirs__ (*An Lomair Mòr* in [Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_language)) (occasionally [anglicised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicised) __Lammermoors__), in southern [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland), form a natural boundary between [Lothian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothian) and the [Scottish Borders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Borders).

&gt;[Sir Walter Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Walter_Scott)'s historical novel *[The Bride of Lammermoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bride_of_Lammermoor)* is set in the area (as is [Gaetano Donizetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaetano_Donizetti)'s [opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera) *[Lucia di Lammermoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucia_di_Lammermoor)*, based on Scott's novel).

&gt;The __Lammermuir Hills__ span the areas of [East Lothian Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Lothian_Council) and the [Scottish Borders Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Borders_Council), and they extend from [Gala Water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gala_Water) to [St. Abb's Head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Abb%27s_Head), and offer a traditional site for [sheep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep) grazing.

null,false,Tjkoopa,7,Bolasie,null,"The history of our club is pretty damn long and winding (we've been around since 1905), you're best reading about it on wikipedia and other sites.

In modern times we've not had it easy making our name in the premier league, we're often described as a yoyo club because of our infrequent visits to the top tier for one season before going straight back down.

In 2010 we went into administration, we were poised to drop down to the third tier (league one) but even worse were in danger of losing the club. A consortium of (rich) fans bought us up and have brought us out of danger and into the happier times you join us in now, they brought a lot of stability to the club and their thoughts were always on securing that stability for the future.

Our squad is strengthening well, we have more depth than we've seen for a long time and it can be difficult to choose a definite starting lineup without worrying about leaving out several very good players. Take a look at the west ham match thread, there's good discussion in there about our current team and squad, you will be able to see who we stress over.

We have a lot of key players in the side right now, too many for me to list at the moment, so I think I'll list the ones I feel have the most sentimental importance for us:

**Mile Jedinak** (Jedi) - Our leader. Backbone of our midfield, just returned from winning the asian cup captaining Australia. Came back injured extending his absence to 2 months out of the team, he has been sorely missed and it will be excellent to see him back today

**Julian Speroni** (Jules) - Our keeper. Has been the most consistent player for years now and the number of times he has snatched us from tragedy with a mindblowing save or overall performance is beyond counting. He is regarded as heading towards the end of his career now and Hennessey is being groomed as a replacement I believe

**Wilfried Zaha** (Wilf) - Our son. Started with the club aged 12 and grew up in our development teams before breaking into the first team and becoming a fan favourite. He was one of the major reasons we're in the premier league today, and it was a sad but understandable time when he moved to Man U. We bought him back recently (for much less than he was sold I might add) and he is just getting back into the rhythm, there are doubters but I think this boy still has a successful career ahead of him.

Keep an eye on Bolasie for entertainment. He is ferocious, strong, fast and always offense minded. He is in his element with the ball at his feet, storming up the wings at as many defenders as dare stand in his way. Frequently embarrasses players with a combination of astonishing skill, ball control and a level of unpredictability that can only come from a player that has no idea what they're about to do next themselves. I like to think he isn't so much in control of his limbs as they are just propelling themselves towards the goal by any means necessary and the rest of his body just gets dragged a long for the ride. He is very good at getting the ball into dangerous areas, unfortunately his end product is generally a bit wanting and 8/10 times he's going to favour wanging it into the crowd.",null,0,null,1425120937,null,0,1425121607,0,cozuf6m,null,t3_2xg5ag,null,t1_cozuf6m,null,t3_2xg5ag,null,null,null,1427501560,null,10,false,crystalpalace,t5_2tqdj,10,null

Those effectiveness of half-billion quid fighter jets is grossly overrated, the concept of main battle tanks is nearing obsolescence (despite the Challenger 2 being the world's finest) and just about any warship in the world can be knocked out with missiles like the Exocet which have existed for over 30 years. 

The future of war is local proxies (arming your enemy's enemies), special forces operations, drones strikes, defensive missile batteries and cyber warfare. Prepare with those, sure, because they provide much better bang for buck than the costly white elephants argued for by traditional military spending hawks. 

It's also an absolute nightmare to occupy an uncooperative territory. Russia simply cannot sweep through Europe with its tank divisions the way Germany did in '39-43. Just look at how much blood and treasure was lost in Helmand to a bunch of armed shepherds.

&gt;An honor killing or honour killing (see spelling differences) is the homicide of a member of a family by other members, due to the perpetrators' belief that the victim has brought shame or dishonor upon the family or has violated the principles of a religion, usually for reasons such as refusing to enter an arranged marriage, being in a relationship that is disapproved by their family, having sex outside marriage, becoming the victim of rape, dressing in ways which are deemed inappropriate, or engaging in homosexual relations.

&gt;In December 2009, the Metropolitan Police reported that there had been a huge rise in recorded incidents motivated by ""honour.""

It goes on to say that

The new build are around £220k so a 20% discount supposedly will put them around £160k. A one bed older flat is around £170-180k. I can't imagine that it will be cheaper to buy a new flat rather than an older flat, so either new builds will have to increase in price or older flats will have to fall in price. Call me cynical but I can't imagine the end result will be favourable to first time buyers one way or another.

I had a quick look at the [consultation](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/stepping-onto-the-property-ladder) which seems to suggest that:

* it wont apply to existing new build projects ie it will be several years until the first ones appear on the market
* they seem to be on brownfield sites where planning permission may currently be difficult (so we may see them in inappropriate locations eg where traffic is already bottlenecked, has wider negative consequences etc)
* They remove all S106 and CIL contributions from the developer so removes funds to local authorities to improve local infrastructure near new properties.

So taking a development in London, developers would usually pay a CIL which goes towards improving local infrastructure - school places, NHS capacity etc. And a S106 that pays for transport plans, improved bus links, etc. Potentially none of that will happen but you whack another thousand people into the local area, things could start to get a bit uncomfortable.

TFA on its own wouldn't protect from a compromised client machine. You'd need a keypad device so that you'd actually vote on the device itself.

(Oh, and this assumes you can stop the TFA device being compromised at source. Given that national security agencies seem to have been up to this kind of stuff at large scales (eg SIM cards) is a pretty big concern too.)

&gt; Obviously coercion is possible, but I very much doubt even physical voting can stop blackmail etc. 

No, voting in person *can* stop blackmail, because someone can coerce you to vote for X, but since your vote is secret, you can vote for Y instead and just say you voted for X.

Postal/proxy votes are a problem - there used to be a much higher barrier to getting one so the numbers were smaller and thus less of a concern.

If you genuinely have done nothing, I would contact the police directly and arrange a convenient time for them to come round. Throw out the legal high stuff. Police have good instincts, but you just don't want anything that will peak their interest and if you feel even slightly worried about it, it'll just make talking to the police more stressful for you. You can always get more later. They wouldn't care, but they might just take it off you anyway. Be totally upfront and honest. Give them decent answers to any questions. They are probably not going to be smiley and friendly, but they'll be calm and at ease, so don't worry about them barging in and being shouty or aggressive. 

There is a thing whereby people do use it as a way to intimidate people they don't like in the hope they'll get raided. If you can think of anyone who might do this, then let the police know about this when you have them round. Likewise if your housemates are all on the same page, have a think about who might have tipped off the police and let them know about it. 

If you're concerned about the empty house, discuss this with the police as well. My parents were burgled a while ago and the police helped them work out LOADS of ways to make their house less attractive to burglars. They may have some really great ideas or things they can do to make you feel more secure in your home. 

I'm exactly like you. I cannot BEAR to be told off, get in trouble, do anything wrong. I am such a stickler for the rules because I just can't handle stuff like that, but just keep in mind that the police are just checking, seeing if there's any information to be had and if not, they can be really useful people to get assistance and reassurance from. I would just get ahead of it and contact the police rather than sitting around waiting for them to turn up.

null,false,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,null,"It was a while ago I worked on this but the UK data less than ten years ago were unambiguous that short sentences (under two years) increased recidivism and longer sentences (five years and above) reduced recidivism, with the longer the sentence the greater the reduction of recidivism. This was a total across the board, not by type of crime and there may have been anomalies for individual crimes.

&gt; As for the rest, I'm not sure what human rights legislation has to do with anything, or if there's evidence of being afraid of litigation.

Everything from more prison staff, to improved facilities costs more money and [the figures are high](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/251272/prison-costs-summary-12-13.pdf).

&gt; Even if there has (as you claim) been a push to keep sentences shorter, that isn't reflected in the data - sentences have been getting longer, and more people are going to prison.

I've not been able to find older figures than the past couple of decades, but I'm pretty sure that if we could cover the entirety of the last century we'd see that more recent trends pale against sentencing prior to the 1990s. As for the numbers of prisoners, I'm not entirely certain how they fare against the population increases but I believe that we do indeed have a greater percentage of the population in prison now than we did previously despite lead being removed from fuels and all the other considerations that are supposed to have reduced crime levels.

&gt; What is the minimum sentence length at which it shouldn't be called into question? Why that length?

I'm not sure there is a black and white answer, but one year ten weeks per person you tried to kill does raise the question of whether justice is being served when the legal guidance states that for [""Other planned attempts to kill"" resulting in some to serious physical/psychological harm warrant a sentence starting at 15-20 years](http://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Attempted_Murder_-_Definitive_Guideline_webaccessible1.pdf). I'm aware that the perp was charged with wounding with intent rather than attempted murder, but this was a legal negotiation between the defence and the prosecution in return for a guilty plea rather than a strict adherence to prosecuting the crime (which funnily enough is also a financial consideration, saving on the cost of a trial and potential appeal).

I can tell you that male rapers and abusers are definitely not always immediately arrested.

The police were very supportive in trying to get evidence, eg getting me to call the abuser and confront him in the hopes of getting a confession.

null,false,deviden,null,null,null,"&gt; I guess the big question is how exactly NATO would respond if Russia deciding to stroll over the border into a NATO members territory.

My guess is that the first response would be to send military intelligence, special forces and vast amounts of weaponry to local resistance to fight an asymmetrical war, just as they did in Afghanistan in the '80s. Combine that with economic sanctions, drone strikes and massive cyber warfare attacks to bleed their coffers dry and entangle their forces in the most miserable occupation of enemy territory imaginable. 

By the time it came to unleashing conventional NATO forces the position of their Russian counterparts would be sketchy at best. The years following the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan have shown how *incredibly fucking difficult* it is, even for the world's best equipped forces, to sustain an occupation against insurgents. Imagine trying to hold territory when facing an insurgency and there's a NATO force coming at you.

The ""shock and awe"" tactics deployed in Iraq 2003 demonstrated the total obsolescence of traditional concepts of military might through numbers (and by extension the entire strategy underpinning Russia and China's respective military forces) against NATO forces. I'm not surprised they've bumped up military spending - they have to in order to maintain a credibly threatening posture. 

Don't get me wrong, Russia on the warpath would be horrifically devastating, especially for the populace of invaded nations, but it's not something they can realistically win against NATO.",null,0,null,1425125401,null,0,false,0,cozv6dh,null,t3_2xfujl,null,t1_cozv6dh,null,t1_cozuxij,null,null,null,1427501912,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

| | | | 
:----------|:----------|:----------|
**Goalkeeper** | 
Speroni (1) |  | Been with us for just over 10 years. He has stuck with us through the good and bad. He's a little bit past his best, but still a decent shot stopper. This might be his last season as first choice. Legend.
**Defenders** | 
Souaré (40) | Left Back | Only signed in January. He's played two games so far. Nearly gave away a penalty in the cup game against Liverpool and gave a penalty away in the league game against Arsenal (although it was outside the box). It's hard to tell how good he is at the moment.
Kelly (34) | Left Back/Right Back | Probably won't play today because of Souaré. Sometimes he looks shaky, and slow, sometimes he's good defensively. Not great going forward. His future lies as a centre half in my opinion.
Dann (6) | Central Defender | Probably our best defender, one of our best players. Very solid, can pass it out well.
Delaney (27) | Central Defender | Watch out for the long balls. Loves hoofing it. Good at blocking and making important tackles. Can sometimes make mistakes.
Hangeland (4) | Central Defender | Love this guy. Fucking giant. Calm, can pass it and read the game well. Loves a header, so watch out for him when we get a corner. Very Slow. Probably won't play.
Ward (2) | Right Back | One of our best players last season. His form this season has been quite inconsistent. Mostly solid defending and attacking.
**Midfielders** |
Bolasie (7) | Winger | Strong, exciting, loves to charge at and beat players. If he's playing well he's the best on the pitch; if he's playing badly he's the worst.
McArthur (18) | Centre Mid | Our best player this season in my opinion. Works very hard. He's the engine of the team. Good going forward, good defending. Loves to clear the ball off the line.
Ledley (28) | Centre Mid | Similar to McArthur. Good attacking and defending. Does a low-key important job.
Jedinak (15) | Centre Mid | Our captain and the captain for Australia. Good at breaking up play through tackles and intercepting. A natural leader who has been with us for a few years. According to stats he's one of the best midfielders in Europe. Sometimes his passing is poor. Not someone you want to fuck with.
Puncheon (42) | Attacking Mid/ Winger | One of the reasons we stayed up last season was his goals. Calm on the ball. He isn't as explosive as Bolasie or Zaha but he has a great shot.
Zaha (11) | Winger | Been with us since he was 10. Left for a season to go to Man United, but came back. Scored two massive goals in the play off semi-final against our rivals, Brighton. Won the penalty in the play off final against Watford which sent us up to the Premier League. He's a tricky winger. When he's beating players and making chances, he's incredible. Sometimes he lacks that final ball. Loved by Palace fans.
**Forwards** |
Glenn Murray (17) | Striker | Scored 31 goals in the season we were promoted. Suffered an injury in the play off semi final so was out for a year. Can score goals, but hasn't been given much on an opportunity yet in the Premier League.
Gayle (16) | Striker | Lethal goal scorer. However it's difficult to fit him in our system. Would play well with another big striker I think, but we usually play a lone striker. Loves scoring against Liverpool.
Chamakh (29) | Attacking Mid/ Forward | Usually plays as an advanced midfielder. Aggressive, class on the ball and can link up well with other players. Love him.

""A male born in the UK in 1945 had a life expectancy of 63 years. A male born in 2001 had a life expectancy of 75. A male or female born today has a life expectancy of over 80 years (World Bank and UK Statistics Agency figures.)

With a retirement age of 65 in the UK, the state pension was designed to pay out a couple of years *after* the average male would have already died. Disregarding any tinkering with the retirement age and assuming it remains at 65 means the *average* person will have a couple of decades on state pension before they die.

The whole system was only fair insofar as it allowed people to go to university that previously could not afford to.

If you want the kind of city where the vast majority of homes are owned by landlords who rent them out for ever increasing prices, that's fine. But unless you have policies that incentivize wages growing in step, the end result will be that more and more people are pushed farther out to peripheral areas, where rents are lower.

And, again, that's not necessarily an evil by itself, except if there is a lack of infrastructure to then support that commuter population. In London, for example, there is a reasonably well-developed tube and other rail system North of the river, but South of it a lot of the land is ""here be dragons"" in terms of usable rush hour transport.

The consequences of that is a city underusing its developed land (because everyone needs to live reasonably close to transport) and\or suffering from insane traffic problems because it's trying to move a sizeable portion of its people on cars and busses rather than trains.

There are other strategies that you could use to turn this situation around. For example, you could incentivize the development of non-central areas as business concentrations. This has partly been done (e.g. Canary Warf), but not to such a degree as to truly distrbute London's commuter destinations over its useable space.

tl;dr an expensive city isn't a problem by itself, it's a problem if people can't afford to live there or efficiently commute into it. In this Londoner's opinion, London is lagging behind in the need to either provide efficient transport options to much of its land and in the need to decentralize its business districts.",null,0,null,1425127151,null,0,false,0,cozvi7c,null,t3_2xg026,null,t1_cozvi7c,null,t1_cozuxr3,null,null,null,1427502065,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

With open discussion about its compatibility with liberal western democracy. Islam's record on human rights is diabolical, even in its very recent history.

&gt;If you let them know how much you disagree with them they'll eventually just drop it and become atheists?

A tide is turned, not slammed into reverse. Islam, and most other religions, are not supported by rationality. In open discussion, the rational argument almost always wins out.

If you suppress rational criticism of Islam, then the only critics of Islam you will see are far right nutjobs. This will get worse and worse until people start dying.

&gt;There is a difference in enforcing Islamic laws and allowing people their freedom of religion.

We already have had sharia inheritance laws ratfied by the law society. These were actually repealed in 2014 because they were so objectionable, but they were law for several years.

People have freedom of religion, but if you bring that religion into politics then you should be mercilessly set upon from every avenue of rational argument.

TL:DR  

* These figures are from the end last season where were in the championship  after being relegated. 

* The old manager and board gave out large bonuses to players for first time promotion (which they achieved).
 
* We paid off some highly paid members of staff mid season. (the aforementioned old manager and some of the board).

* The money from the takeover offset a large portion of the shortfall. 

* This season we've been living within our means hence a fairly small squad made up of players brought in for free (or next to nothing).

* New people in charge of the club working to become fully debt free (Which we are right now in terms of bank debt).",null,0,null,1425130638,null,0,false,0,cozwa79,null,t3_2xgdfw,null,t1_cozwa79,null,t3_2xgdfw,null,null,null,1427502428,null,3,false,ScottishFootball,t5_2sba4,3,null

the result is this image builds that this kind of thing is only for borderline nazi, skinhead football casuals and if you turn up that's what you are too, when the basic message is something that a lot of people, maybe a majority would agree with.",null,0,null,1425130779,null,0,false,0,cozwbg9,null,t3_2xga3z,null,t1_cozwbg9,null,t3_2xga3z,null,null,null,1427502444,null,28,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,28,null

But you can move and park mobile anti-air systems to set up shop anywhere you fancy on your own land.

Same with carriers. Easier to spend a few million developing anti-ship missiles than billions developing carriers, which is exactly what Russia have done.

I think the UK knows this too. We have small numbers of great quality kit, rather than a huge amount to attempt overwhelming force.

If we took a firmer stance on religion in general, be it Islam or another, then this ""far-right radicalism"" wouldnt happen nearly as much. 

A good analogy is this:

If Russia invaded the UK, and all other parties were for appeasing the new russian government, and the only party opposing russian invasion were Britain First. Would you be tempted to sign up with them?

We align our politics with the party coming closest to what we belief. This stays true even if that party has very little in common with what we believe.

This means that the longer we try and suppress criticism of Islam, the more movements like Pegida will grow, because nobody else is prepared to speak out.

Of course, to me it's more binding than inviting punishment from a God who I don't believe exists.

null,false,DukePPUk,null,null,null,"&gt;  the UK data less than ten years ago were unambiguous that short sentences (under two years) increased recidivism and longer sentences (five years and above) reduced recidivism

That's more or less the data from the first study I linked; comparing re-offending by length of sentence, in groups. It found that &lt;12 months sentences were generally the worst for re-offending, with 1-4 years, *and* community orders both having lower rates. But that was looking specifically at proven re-offending after 1 year, and comes with at least two qualifications (that 12 months in prison is the cut off for getting post-prison support, and that re-offending rates correlate with age on release, while that study compared age on conviction, not release) - so far I haven't been able to find rates for life time re-offending. [This Prison Reform Trust briefing](http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/Portals/0/Documents/Prisonthefacts.pdf) notes that while 47% of prisoners are proven re-offenders within 1 year, that goes up to 60% after two years. Which is a rather depressing statistic.

The figures for prison costs are high. But that document doesn't make any mention of human rights legislation being responsible.

On the facts we have we don't know what the individuals were charged with - whether they were charged with attempted murder before that was dropped following the guilty plea, or whether - based on the evidence they had - the CPS decided that they might not be able to get attempted murder to stick.

That said, wounding carries a maximum life sentence, iirc, so it would be open for them to have been sentenced for much longer. The other thing to note is that while there were 4 victims involved, based on the article it looks like only one of them was the victim of wounding, so rather than one year per victim, it was 9 and 8 years per victim for the wounding offences.

The criminal justice system in England and Wales does have a serious problem with finances; for both sides, and that may be leading to more US-style pleading down - from both sides. Unfortunately the current Government's plans to 'fix' this have involved removing more funding for defendants (making it worse) and allowing for single-magistrate convictions, and convictions at police stations etc., to reduce costs.",null,0,null,1425132646,null,0,false,0,cozwt6j,null,t3_2x87so,null,t1_cozwt6j,null,t1_cozv4hk,null,null,null,1427502674,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

To Answer the OP's final question though.  There are a number of experiments you can find published on YouTube.  The public sees woman on man domestic violence as acceptable, or at least not something requiring intervention when it occurs in a public place.  The reverse (Man on Woman domestic violence) will garner intervention far more often, though as an aside, the likelihood of intervention in either case is low. The reactions of the onlookers even without intervention, is telling.  It almost always favors the woman when she's the aggressor, and the woman when the victim.  Post scenario interviews indicated that a large percentage of onlookers think the man likely did something that caused the woman to snap, and the aggressive female was probably justified in her actions and demeanor, even if it's not apparent why.

null,false,oldcat,null,null,null,"Me: Scottish, Yes voter at last referendum, probably going to vote SNP. You might think I'd be really angry about the idea of Scotland getting less money, I'm not. What I am angry about is that it is a political football that's being kicked about. The Tories have considered it but know it would mean a Yes vote, Labour are to scared of it, the SNP claim any attempt to change Barnett is an attack on Scotland. What we need is to take this out of politicians hands and have it worked out completely independently, I'm not even sure that's possible. 

For as long as it's political Labour will be torn as they're losing Scotland and don't know what to do. Tories and UKIP will want Scotland to have less. SNP will want Scotland to have more and God knows what way the Lib Dems will go. 

I don't know if Barnett is fair, but for as long as we are part of the UK it has to be based on need not contribution (there are arguments that Scotland contributes more than it gets back and arguments that we contribute less, largely swings on oil and with the temporary price drop I expect that right now we don't). Besides, how do you calculate contribution? Scotland has half the population of London in an area much much larger. Providing equal levels of service across the UK will cost more in Scotland due to the remoteness of the rural population.

A solution also needs the consequentials of Barnett while we're under our current system of governance. If the UK Government changes budgets for things in England (and Wales and NI where they can) this should increase or decrease the budgets for Scotland, Wales and NI. How that should work again needs working out. It also means that any vote on policy in England should be split in two, first a vote on the required budgetary change that all MPs vote in, then a vote on the policy that only the MPs from the affected nations vote in. 
Sadly I don't think any of this is possible as that's not how our politics works.

I can see this, or a 4-3-3 with oscar in for cuadrado, and with ramires sitting behind oscar and fabregas. The first just has so much workrate and pressing from the front that it will be nearly impossible for spurs to feed kane. The 4-3-3 is probably a little more defensive, since imo, oscar presses and defends a lot better than cuadrado. It also gives us the option of having an extra ""#10"" on the field with oscar. I think the 4-2-3-1 is the better option, and is probably what mourinho will play tomorrow.

We are renewing key pieces of kit - new planes (F-35), new carriers, new Trident subs, new Trafalgar subs, new Type 45 destroyers (for air defence). And we already have the excellent Challenger 2 tank.

That stuff all needed to be done just to stay competitive.

**7 Min:** Lively start, most notable event so far was a good cross in from Benteke which Sinclair nearly put in.  
**9 Min'** Villa seem up for it, pressing Newcastle where possible. Early days but it does seem different to Lambert's style so far.  
**11 Min'** Villa attack, it comes to nothing but it was delightful to see *other Villa players* in the box, giving options. Corner to Newcastle, too deep, goes for a throw in.  
**14 Min'** Benteke rises to head forward to Gabby who rushes through the Newcastle back line, he puts it away but offside has already been called.  
**15 Min'** Lowton has done some of Villa's best crosses in his time here, unfortunately he wastes a break with a bad one straight to Tim Krul.  
**16 Min'** Cross forward controlled by Cisse, just a few feet from the corner of the goal, decisive tackle by Hutton puts it out. Some pressure from Newcastle here.  
**17 Min'** Newcastle fans pay tribute to two victims of MH17. Villa win a free kick, Westwood takes it, wasted.  
**20 Min'** Villa having a good amount of the play but not making it into the final third most of the time.  
**22 Min'** Not *quite* come together yet but Villa are playing well I think. Two fairly good attacks end with a misplaced pass and then header from Benteke, who seems a tad more involved.  
**24 Min'** Lovely diagonal forward from Lowton, Benteke strikes it on his first touch, just a foot wide.  
**25 Min'** A bit silly from Hutton, who commits a foul and gets a  **yellow card** for showing his frustration towards the linesman.  
**26 Min'** Some beautiful hold up play from Sinclair, ends up winning a free kick.  
**27 Min'** Great overhead kick from Benteke... unluckily stopped by Krul. Good attempt. Corner.  
**29 Min'** That corner led to another corner, both came to nothing, Newcastle broke but Delph dealt with it.  
**31 Min'** A bit sloppy from Villa to let Newcastle into their box, penalty call as Delph challenges someone inside the box but it's not called, probably correctly.  
**33 Min'** Benteke out wide to Hutton, crosses back to Benteke, tries an athletic volley which doesn't quite come off, he then gets the ball in the box but doesn't have the space to pass, move ends with Delph driving wide. Good play.  
**33 Min'** Ball over the top to Sinclair from Westwood, he has to volley and just can't get enough power to challenge Krul.  
**35 Min'** A good display so far, Villa are pressing well and Benteke has been much more involved.  
**37 Min'** **1-0 to Newcastle**... ball into the box misses the Villa defender and Cisse powers it home from close range. Against the run of the play.  
Poor from Okore, but I don't personally think we deserved that.  
**40 Min'** Newcastle look to turn on Siege Mode, on the front foot since the goal.  
**41 Min'** Riviere unmarked at a corner, powers a header just wide.  
**44 Min'** Guzan catches a Newcastle free kick. It's a case of holding on until half time now, you feel.  
**46 Min'** **Yellow card for Lowton**, whistle blown as the free kick is struck for **Half Time**. Annoying, Villa were looking good until the goal, which was unfortunately down to poor defending from Okore.  
**Back underway.** A decisive 45 minutes for Aston Villa loom.  
**48 Min'** It's been Newcastle so far, a ball out wide to Obertan is collected but put over and out thankfully.  
**50 Min'** Villa manage a break but it comes to nothing.  
**51 Min'** Was wondering why it looked duller, then remembered I had switched streams. Stray passes all over the place from Villa, Delph being a notable culprit.  
**52 Min'** **Yellow card to Williamson** who takes out Agbonlahor at the byline. Free kick forward is nodded back to Gabby, who fires wide from distance.  
**54 Min'** Some of the drive and threat that Villa showed first half is gone, but they have just won a free kick near the corner of the box.  
**55 Min'** Poor one from Westwood, hits the wall and Newcastle can come forward.  
**57 Min'** A free kick conceded by Westwood is heading goalwards by Cisse, but wide. Guzan didn't have it covered. Villa unlucky as Sinclair ball in is deflected straight to another Newcastle player.  
**60 Min'** **Haidara** is stretchered off, **Ryan Taylor** is his replacement. Villa have half an hour to rescue some points- and perhaps their entire season.  
**62 Min'** Villa spring to life, Benteke heads on to Cleverley to brings it down and nearly equalises. Come on Vi-llla.  
**63 Min'** Ryan Taylor free kick is headed for bottom corner, but Guzan is equal to it. Worth mentioning that Benteke is playing rather well.  
**66 Min'** **CHARLES N'ZOGBIA** replaces **SCOTT SINCLAIR**. Villa are playing a little better now I think, closer to their first half form. Newcastle break, but good work by Hutton to reduce a Sissoko shot to a tame ball safely into the loving arms of Guzan.  
**67 Min'** Newcastle broke and Obertan looked certain to score... somehow the ball is prised away from him and Villa survive.  
**Some good news-** Within a couple of minutes United have scored against Sunderland and Swansea are leading Burnley.  
**69 Min'** N'Zogbia ball in, stolen from Benteke by Williamson. The corner in ends in a goal line scramble, don't know how that didn't go in. Then Benteke puts the ball in the net but was offside.  **Aaaaarrghhhhhh**.  
**71 Min'** Newcastle corner, comes to nothing eventually. Straight up the pitch, Benteke wins a header, the ball is passed across to N'Zogbia who fires high and wide.  
**73 Min'** **ANDY WEIMANN** replaces **GABBY AGBONLAHOR**.  
**74 Min'** Everyone back for a Newcastle corner. Wedtwood steals the ball, but it is pulled back for N'Zogbia leaning into a player. Free kick on the edge of the box. Man...  
**75 Min'** Ryan Taylor finds the corner. But so does Guzan.  
**76 Min'** Deep corner. Newcastle hit the post, somehow.  
**77 Min'** Time is running out. **Gouffran** replaces **Obertan**.  
**79 Min'** Just not happening for Villa. Balls forward are seldom won.  
**80 Min'** Lowton runs through a couple of defenders, shot rebounds to Westwood, Coloccinni makes a good block against his shot on target.  
**81 Min'** He's done all he can, **BACUNA** replaces **LOWTON**.  
**82 Min'** **Yellow card** for Clark for a lunge, free kick out wide.  
**83 Min'** Ryan Taylor swings it in, subsequent shot goes out for a corner. A long shot from Taylor, Guzan gets behind it. Villa break down the right, but the throw-in is wasted...  
**85 Min'** An equaliser looks further away now, sadly. We had a good spell around the 70th minute but have faded since. Depressing.  
**87 Min'** Stoke are beating Hull, but it's not much good ultimately if we don't score.  
**6 MINUTES ADDED**. Cleverley brought down, free kick.  
**90 Min'** And again it comes to naught.  
**91 Min'**  Ameobi does a sea-lion impression, keeping the ball from Hutton.  
**93 min'** Poor Tim looks heartbroken. Villa are struggling to build anything. Goal kick to Newcastle.  
**94 Min'** Corner to Newcastle. Tears flow in Birmingham.  
**95 Min'** And predictably the ball stays in the corner. **Yellow card** to Cleverley.  
**96 Min'** Guzan launches forward. Balls drops to N'Zogbia. He shoots. Over.

null,false,winchyy,lfc68,,null,"So the Main Stand Expansion, or **Stage One** as the club have labelled it, is happening. It's started, no takesies backsies. That should be finished by the start of the 2017-18 season. It's a 9,000 seat expansion to the Main Stand. [Here's a video detailing the expansion.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjP3iucjAdk)

That will make Anfield's capacity 54,000 as of August 2017.

At some point during **Stage One**, the club will make a decision on whether the next stage of the expansion will go ahead after the Main Stand is completed, surprisingly named **Stage Two**. 

This decision is rumoured to be whether the club can:

* Afford **Stage Two** at that current time, and/or
* Are confident that the club can consistently sell 58,000 tickets

**Stage Two** is the expansion of the Anfield Road end by roughly 4,000 tickets, bringing the total capacity to just shy of 59,000. No time frame has been given yet on this stage, though it shouldn't be anymore than a season, two at the most.

Overall that's a 59,000 capacity Anfield, with a heavily invested-in surrounding area, with **Stage One** (The Main Stand and the surrounding Areas) costing the club roughly £260m. **Stage Two** would cost significantly less, though again no official figures have been displayed. The club has also announced they will look to sell naming rights to the Main Stand to help fund the redevelopment of the larger Anfield area.

The Stanley Park model is far less coss-effective, as an entire new Stadium with a rumoured capacity of between 60,000 and 70,000 would cost atleast £700m. It would also be likely that the club would sell naming rights to the stadium, which would remove the uniqueness of Anfield in todays environment.

Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool's Owners, did a similar redevelopment of their other sport franchise's stadium, Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox. Their desire to remain at the ancestral home of their respective clubs, whilst being committed to finding cost-effective measures to improve match-day revenue and stadium quality and safety are indicative of their understanding of emotional attachment in sport, and that there is still a spot for it in todays football world.

On /r/LiverpoolFC, an AMA with a representative from the infrastructure company in charge of the entire project stated that, upon request from FSG, Carillon Construction compiled a report that stated there was a potential capacity of 71,000 at Anfield if they filled in the corners of the ground, and restructured some seating.

So it's cheaper, more in line with the values of both the owners and the fans, will be easier to pay off and will allow Liverpool FC to remain at their Home.

null,false,Brian,null,null,null,"&gt;The current taxpayer is paying for it

No - that's my point.  Pensions are not funded from tax, but from National Insurance payments.  The same national insurance payments those people made into the system for all they years they were working, under the understanding that they were funding a system that would grant them a pension. They really did put in that money, and if the government doesn't honor that deal, they're owed that money back at the very least.

&gt;And there are surely better ways of using that money

That doesn't justify taking it.  You could just as easily say there are better ways of using **all** their money, so we should just take it.  But that's essentially theft - we don't have the right to take their money.  The same here - they've paid for something that the government agreed to provide in exchange: why should the government have the right to just write off the obligation they agreed to like that?  If it were a commercial pension provider saying ""OK - you've paid in to our policy for 30+ years, but you're well off enough that we don't think you need it, so we'll just keep the money"", they'd never get away with it.  So why can the government?

Now, there's the argument that the goverment probably made a bad deal with NI, since they didn't expect the rising life expectancy.  But ultimately, that's our problem - just like the commercial provider making a loss due to a miscalculation wouldn't justify stealing their customer's pensions, it doesn't for the government either.",null,0,null,1425139218,null,0,false,0,cozz4hd,null,t3_2xcgtz,null,t1_cozz4hd,null,t1_cozyrxa,null,null,null,1427503825,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The character could be argued to be one of the most tragic, just due to her love of life with the Doctor. Some fans are not clear on whether she loved him personally (*I* don't think she loved him any more than you would ""love"" a very close friend, but that was made unclear to some when she reappeared in the new series due to shitty dialogue choices) or if she was in love with the lifestyle of space travel and adventure.

She then went through life as a shell of her former self, never able to harness the life of adventure she previously had in space travel. She became an investigative reporter and used her prior experiences with the Doctor to help if there was an actual alien connection with the strange activity.

She ended up meeting up with the Doctor again and her life  made a turn for the better in that she adopted an alien son, K-9 was fixed (then destroyed and replaced) by the Doctor, and she started her own *alien* investigative agency with her son and some neighborhood kids (and a possibly sentient supercomputer she named ""Mr. Smith"" in memory of her time with the Doctor, a source she could always go to answers for...)

null,false,bcash,null,null,null,"Buy-to-let is the key to the whole thing.  But I think for different reasons, ""forcing up rents"" isn't easy and may not even be possible.  

The rent-seeking theory of the modern housing market doesn't make much sense.  If people can afford the rent on somewhere they couldn't afford to buy, then we have an unsustainable situation, as the landlord is implicitly subsidising the tenant; the market value of putting a roof over your head for a month is much lower than the cost of financing a loan for a month to buy a permanent roof over your head.

Also, unlike sale prices which are a product of a combination of: need, expectation and speculation.  Rent is simply ""what can the market achieve right now"", no-one is active on the demand-side of the rental market unless they need to be, and they all have a hard upper-limit on price.

tl;dr - buy-to-letters aren't motivated by monthly profit, just capital growth, but in doing so such growth depends on people continuing to invest in buy-to-let when the gap between purchase and rental prices continues to diverge.

Disclaimer - not all landlords are idiots, some do a lot of research and carefully identify the few locations where buying-to-let actually makes sense on a month-by-month basis; the rest though are just fingers-crossed for an infinite rising market without putting much thought into the precise market forces in their area.

The affordability of finance on a house is, of course, related to interest rates.  This is why interest rates are going to be remarkably difficult to raise.  Everyone's spent the last seven years maximising the leverage of the borrowings, just a small rise would throw a lot of less-skilled landlord's finances completely out-of-the window.

We fly surveillance aircraft mostly. They sent a specific type of bomber which can carry nuclear weapons. We are signalling ""we're watching. You should behave"", whereas their message is a more threatening one of ""just to remind you that we can fuck you up"". 

Also, the Russians take much more direct, aggressive actions, such as ""buzzing"" ships and flying super close to other aircraft.

They also seem to time their events - like flying strategic bombers up to Canada while a NATO meeting was going on, and significantly stepping up their intimidation of Northern Europe while the whole ""Ukraine"" situation is going on. 

They also made several moves against Baltic states right after Obama had *just* left the area. He had been visiting in order to reassure those countries of continued US support.

Quite a few appalling ones in here.

&gt;On 17 September 2014 two Russian military aircraft crossed into Swedish air-space south of the island of Oland. The Russian Su-24 bombers intentionally violated Swedish airspace possibly to test the capabilities of the air defence system strengthened after previous incidents. The Swedish Foreign Minister described the incident as the ‘most serious aerial incursion’ in years.

and

&gt;On 12 April 2014 an unarmed Russian fighter aircraft made 12 passes of the American warship the USS Cook in the Black Sea. Such aggressive behaviour, if repeated by an armed aircraft, could have resulted in the ship commander targeting the aircraft in an act of self-defence.

null,false,JF_1010,fanatics,Holmesdale Fanatics,null,"I wrote this in a similar CPFC thread:



The thing that really separates and defines us as a club (for me anyway) is our support. We're regarded as one of the best home supports in the country (if not the best), definitely in the Premier League. 
Our Holmesdale Fanatics are our attempt of creating a euro style Ultra scene at Palace. This has been fantastic for the club. At grounds in the Premier League, technically, you're not allowed to stand for long durations. Away fans are ignored when they stand because there is power in numbers defying the rules. At most grounds in the Premier League, because of seats being highly competitive to obtain, you can't really guarantee the quality of fan you will be sitting next to. This is not the case at Selhurst. The Holmesdale Fanatics (HF05) gradually bought up more and more season tickets in ""that"" corner of the ground. They now have the same defiant power in numbers attitude and essentially, power, as the away fans. In the early days of the Hf05 they were persecuted and police raids to remove fans was common. We now have this great rare position in the league where we have a mental core fan base who take great pride in supporting their community, the players, the club and often engage in fan funded displays at the games. They have a socialist element to them (which I like). They are against the greed of clubs and Premier Leagues who extort the poor with expensive tickets for their own greed. Recently their action has secured a meeting with the PL chief to discuss ticket prices. They are against modern football which is probably worth googling to get some context to what modern football is, if you have nothing historical to compare it to. 


Going back to the power that the HF05 have built themselves is because we have fans on our board (CPFC2010) that are willing to listen and accommodate the Hf05 where they can. The board don't pursue PL instructions to sit the HF05 down during games. Allowed to bring the drum to the game and wave big flags. When doing big displays across the stadium, they are given early access to the ground to get the display in place. 


Back in 2013, we went on a bad run in the Premier League. We lost 4-1 to Fulham at home. The HF05 performed a silent protest during the game at the managers lack of leadership and results. He left the club after that game. The next time they performed a silent protest was when we went 3-0 down to Southampton in December 2014. Neil Warnock was sacked after this game. I am not saying that HF05 can wave a finger and get managers sacked, but if their support is silence (unlike other clubs, we do not boo our team/players or wave flags or signs saying ""Manager Out!""), based on the last two times, the board have acted swiftly and got us a new manager. Which brings me back to my last point; because we have a board consisting of fans, they do listen to the fans. 


We love our chants as well. Start watching PalaceFanTV videos on Youtube. He records the fans at games. This isn't PalaceFanTV but yesterday a Leicester fan recorded the Palace fans and uploaded this great video: http://youtu.be/ehNaPEToA6g


When we score we cheer, then raise our hands and do jazz hands while shouting ""wooooooooaaaaaaah"" for about 30 secs to build suspense and noise. Then it kicks in with WE LOVE YOU. 

""We love you, we love you, we love you. And where you play we follow, we follow, we follow. Cos we support the palace the palace the palace and that's the way we like it, we like it, we like it... Wooooah woooaaah woooaaah""


Watch our Youtubes of chants. If there are any you want lyrics or context for, send me the link and I will explain.

Carefully chosen words, bravo bro. Shame about the other platforms we have buzzing their airspace right now such as our nuclear armed subs and our el-int craft. 

Back when it had technical superiority the US would constantly enter Russian airspace and literally give their guys the finger. The only reason that stopped was when they developed the means to shoot them down. And this is not even touching on things like [Able Archer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Able_Archer_83) where they staged full on nuclear attack drills with armed bombers trying to provoke Russia into a response.

Rory's choice could also be seen as regardless of whatever might have happened in the future. Simply be seen as one of love, I love you enough that I won't willingly leave your side. So he stayed with the idea that he would either protect her or die trying.

The potential possibility of a happy ending is nice, But at the very least he intends to honor her if that never comes to fruition.

It's devotion and not giving up at the first rough patch. Also he had the advantage of not aging, So even if worst came to worst, the only thing he lost was the ability to experience things as they occured.

He could have spent 2000 years only to find out she was dead. And wouldn't have lost anything but the potential to experience the world that occured during those 2000 years.

The UK has [minimum standards for barn raised hens](https://www.gov.uk/welfare-for-meat-chickens-and-breeding-chickens) to ensure they have enough space to move and stretch their wings - Irrespective of the type of system, all chickens should have sufficient freedom of movement to be able, without difficulty, to stand normally, turn around and stretch their wings. They should also have sufficient space to be able to sit without interference from other birds (Gov.uk)

Pigs also have a minimum standard in terms of [housing and management] (https://www.gov.uk/pig-welfare-regulations) and [sow-stalls have been banned] (http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/welfare/onfarm/pigs.htm)
Along with many other welfare standards.

Frequent inspections are carried out at all facilities to ensure these standards are met. 

In terms of slaughter the [law](https://www.gov.uk/farm-animal-welfare-at-slaughter) is very clear about who can slaughter animals and by what methods. It also states that all animals must be stunned (which causes unconsciousness) before 'sticking' can take place. The only exceptions are religious reasons. 



I would also like to quote the website you linked from, 'Most animals spend their short lives in misery, imprisoned in the squalor of factory farms. Many are fully conscious when they are killed by having their throats cut.' - They are very bias and not the best place to find evidence for this discussion. 

Id like to direct you to DEFRA on [pig welfare](http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/welfare/onfarm/pigs.htm) and the [animal welfare section on Gov.uk] (https://www.gov.uk/animal-welfare)

Well then they were wrong. Because that money was used to pay for the state pensions of the generation before them.

That money is not sitting in a pot somewhere. It was spent. Furthermore the money they contributed doesn't come anywhere close to the funds required to fund the state pension for them today.

&gt;It is not public money, it is money that was paid into a pool 

You still seem to be confused about this. The contributions they made were not paid into a pool. They were spent, funding the state pensions of the generation of pensioners before them.

&gt;You're operating under the premise that this is the governments money, but that was not the terms under which NI operates - there's no more justification for the government pocketing their contributions and reneging on the deal than for a commercial business doing so.

Apart from the Hitler quotes and racist slogans they post online. Apart from the attack on migrants that I linked to. Apart from their association with the EDL. Apart from their association with their sister party Legida who have been associated with arson attacks and violence against journalists. There's plenty of evidence that Pegida is violent and associated with the far-right. 

&gt;You are basically calling them fascists because they are opposed to mass immigration. 

Absolutely not. I calling them fascists because they, along with most of the other far-right groups in Europe, fit quite well a number of definitions of fascism. Robert Paxton's definition works quite well. 

&gt;&gt;A form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.

Other definitions include things like being generally anti-maintream politics (anti-left right and centre for different reasons), favouring militant street protest organisation rather than peaceful methods and especially promoting hatred for a scapegoat. Umberto Eco mentions this as one of his 14 fascist properties:

&gt;&gt;""Obsession with a Plot"" and the hyping-up of an enemy threat; This often involves an appeal to xenophobia with an identification of their being an internal security threat: He also cites Pat Robertson's book The New World Order as a prominent example of a plot obsession.

For Pegida, the EDL or Le Front National this internal threat is Muslims in general. 

Eco also includes the use and spread of lies and propaganda in order to anger sympathetic people which is incredibly common among modern day far-right political parties.

null,false,Brian,null,null,null,"&gt;Well then they were wrong

How so?  That was indeed what they were told they were getting from the deal.  And indeed, it **is** what they are getting.  Where the exact piece of money comes from is not the issue here - again, you could say the same for commercial pension providers: the money you pay out is going into the coffers of the company, and the money they pay you comes from the business they build out of it.  Again - the issue is not where the money goes, but what they were paying **for** - what the government promised they would get out of it.

&gt;They were spent

Obviously, yes - just as commercial pension providers spend the money they get, funding and growing the business (along with insuring their obligations).  But they still agreed to obligations in return for that money.  And here the money is still not public - it goes to fund the pension system.

&gt;National Insurance is a tax

Not according to what the government has been saying to those people for the entire lifetime they've been paying into it.  They were explicitly told that this was what would qualify them for pension payments, and exactly what those would be.  To renege on that is going back on our obligations.  It would be **far** more honest (and practical) to just raise taxes on the wealthy if that's the goal, as this at least wouldn't be breaking those promises, and might actually raise enough to be worth caring about (the state pensions of the super-wealthy do not constitute a particularly large amount, given the low number of super-wealthy people, and the small, fixed, size of state pensions).

null,false,BritishDeafMan,null,null,null,"Explanation:

The changes to DSA in next academic year or the year after that means that non-medical helpers budget are either reduced or completely stopped. For deaf people, they need the non-medical helpers budget to pay for BSL interpreters. An average deaf student on science based course, BSL interpreter costs roughly £15k-30k for a whole year. Current maximum for the budget is £20k.

The article missed out one crucial thing: Universities are supposed to cover the shortfall.

What's the problem you may ask. The main problem is that most of times, universities hesitate to fund the shortfall. You'll have to keep bothering them until they do it. You might even need to threaten legal action. There's also issue of passing the responsibility around. 

The second issue is that disability discrimination will become commonplace especially for sixth formers where they have to apply universities. For most deaf people applicants, universities will know their disability long before they decide their fate.

Lastly, it means universities get to decide which classes you get to go, which classes you don't get to go. Obviously, they will have provide interpreters for compulsory classes but what about 100% optional classes, the ones that only 10-15 out of 100-300 people go? What if you need few hours with interpreter to go around the campus to discuss with people (e.g. research project, office visit, etc)?

Cork is great. Just the player we needed; I think we'd be in a much better position this season if we had managed to get him in the summer.

How people can still be anti-Monk at this point is beyond me. Quickest we managed to ever make it to 40 points. He's also currently the highest ranked English Premier League manager.

null,false,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,null,"&gt; In terms of beak trimming, yes studies show it may cause some welfare issues in some cases e.g. Pain and decreased activity . However it has shown to reduce injury and cannibalism

So it **causes** pain but only **reduces** injury and cannibalism. It is required because chickens in such cramped conditions cannot be left to exhibit their natural behavior and instead fight and peck each other to death. I don't see how you can conclude from that that they do not suffer.

&gt; The UK has minimum standards for barn raised hens to ensure they have enough space to move and stretch their wings - Irrespective of the type of system, all chickens should have sufficient freedom of movement to be able, without difficulty, to stand normally, turn around and stretch their wings. They should also have sufficient space to be able to sit without interference from other birds

Compare that to the account in the article I just linked to in my edit:

&gt; I have seen this carnage first hand many times. Dead and dying birds, some slowly being buried under the accumulating waste of the living. Chickens with legs so weakened they buckle and struggle to rise from the ammonia soaked litter which leads to hock burns.

. 

&gt; Pigs also have a minimum standard in terms of housing and management and sow-stalls have been banned Along with many other welfare standards.

The fact is they still spend their lives in indoor barns with bare slatted floors to allow the feces to fall through, with no bedding or stimulation. I don't consider that a decent quality of life for intelligent creatures, your view may differ.

&gt; I would also like to quote the website you linked from, 'Most animals spend their short lives in misery, imprisoned in the squalor of factory farms. Many are fully conscious when they are killed by having their throats cut.' - They are very bias and not the best place to find evidence for this discussion.

In what way is that bias rather than fact?

&gt; Id like to direct you to DEFRA on pig welfare and the animal welfare section on Gov.uk As you said, there are exceptions, for example the video you linked. However that is not ""most of the meat 'meat-eaters' eat""

I tried eating meat ""ethically"" for a while - I don't believe the minimum welfare standards are sufficient to ensure animals don't suffer, even in the UK where the standards are higher. And I found it impossible to only eat meat from higher welfare sources e.g. organic and freedom foods, so I just gave up entirely. Even if you think the minimum standards in the UK are good enough, you'd have to avoid imported meat and live imported animals (the way animals are imported live is itself cruel), and be sure the welfare standards were adhered to. If you think the video I posted was a one off, I'm sure I could find you a dozen more examples, these sorts of abuses happen all the time.",null,0,null,1425143092,null,0,1425143740,0,cp00v5i,null,t3_2xga3z,null,t1_cp00v5i,null,t1_cp006l1,null,null,null,1427504637,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

**1.** The wind was wicked out there, I can imagine it was easy to pass the ball around

**2.** Siggy was out and we are learning a new system, Carroll is a fine prospect but not godd enough to make us forget Gylfi.

**3.** This was an incredibly important match for Burnley. Fans seemed to feel that losing this match would seal their relegation fate and due to this the Burnley players were ready to run through a brick wall to get a result

Even with considering all this however, the passing was horrendous today. We blew so many chances by just missing elementary passes. I feel nauseous even saying this, but Gomis was let down at points by our passing. Additionally, every player's touch seemed to be just off. Burnley almost capitalized on this many times. 

Here's what I really noticed today though:

- Fabianski is a god, I would like to know if he requests a blood sacrifice of cattle or lamb

- Gomis continues his inspiring ascendance to becoming a mid-table quality striker

- Despite some worries today, our fullbacks are no longer a glaring weakness. Naughton and Taylor can hold their own now.

- We should really look into signing Ings

- 5 midfielders and a non-existent midfield. Not sure how that happened at points, but lets hope that disappears with practice

- Cork and Naughton have been brilliant signings in my opinion

- Oliveira always looks so dangerous, he really deserves a start at striker. Must Gomis always get 90min?

If we play like we did today Tottenham is going to obliterate us, that said I think we should hold to this formation.

The only thing that isn't really contextual is trying to fuck the Doctor the day before her wedding, because that occurs outside the relationship. That was simply wrong of her, and indeed that's kind of the point is that its a major growth moment for her when the Doctor handles it how he does.

Around 2 years ago I started randomly breaking out after years of relatively good skin.

In August last year I went to my GP. Was prescribed adapalene cream and doxycycline. Went back after a week or so to switch to adapalene gel.

A month passed and due to the initial breakout from the adapalene my skin was much worse. A complete oil slick with more cysts than I'd ever had in my life. I was so distressed and hated everything about my appearance. My boyfriend really struggled to even get me out of the house at the weekend. So I went back to the doctor and made it very clear that I wanted to see a dermatologist. I was scarring horrifically and my cheeks were covered in indents. I was told I needed to give the antibiotics another 2 months, something I wasn't sure I could do. 

Another month passed and I was researching accutane (I took it as a teenager). I went back to my GP and said I was so distressed by the acne and scarring I would by accutane online and take without medical supervision if needed. I obviously wouldn't do this because accutane is   VERY severe drug and I kind of like having a functioning liver.

I think after this I got a dermatologist appointment pretty soon, the start of October. My skin was a complete mess - worse than ever. My dermatologist listened to everything that I had tried and then asked what I wanted to do. I said I wanted to try accutane and he completely agreed it was the best route for me. I started the course the following week.

I have a monthly appointment with him and he's really great. He doesn't undermine me and he seems very aware that acne doesn't just affect you physically. Because I'm on accutane I have to have monthly pregnancy tests and have had a few blood tests. I have had awful back pain which gets worse when I am more active or doing housework etc. 

A few weeks ago my dermatologist said he wanted me to come off accutane. He understands my concerns about my acne returning and has scheduled an appointment 6 weeks after I finish the course to see how I am doing. He has also asked if there are any topicals I want to keep me going (I am going to ask for more adapalene and maybe some benzyl peroxide). 

I am completely satisfied with how my dermatologist handled my skin. 5 months on from when I first saw him I have scarring but it is fading. I had indents but they have already reduced and once accutane is out of my system he us suggested I try some chemical peels. I haven't had a cyst since the start of January.

He has really been a credit to the NHS and if anyone is struggling with any skin condition I highly recommend you ask to be referred :)",null,0,null,1425143861,null,0,false,0,cp0184x,null,t3_2xbvgu,null,t1_cp0184x,null,t1_cp00tv2,null,null,null,1427504805,null,3,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,3,null

My boyfriend's name is Tony  
He lives in Macaroni  
With a cherry on his nose  
And ten black toes  
And this is how the story goes

My boyfriend gave me an apple  
My boyfriend gave me a pear  
My boyfriend gave me a kiss on the lips \*  
And he threw me down the stairs

I gave him back his apple  
I gave him back his pear  
I gave him back his kiss on the lips

I threw him over England  
I threw him over France  
I threw him over the USA

His underpants were yellow  
His underpants were green  
His underpants had a hole in them  
And his privates could be seen

Hopefully Sakho will start. I'm not one of the supporters who are disappointed in Lovren (we had far to high expectations on him, he deserves some time to grow and find his role), but Sakho is a better fit against Agueros quickness and the physicality of Bony/Dzeko.

Pellegrini didn't adjust his tactics nor changed his 4-4-2 formation against Barcelona, he'll probably won't do it against us.

For the final time. State pensions are not being funded from the money pensioners contributed over their working life. It is being funded from the current taxpayer.

&gt;Where the exact piece of money comes from is not the issue here - again, you could say the same for commercial pension providers:

You could not say the same for commercial pension providers. They operate totally differently. Money you contributed is invested in various funds and returns an interest over time. You receive that money on maturity.

The money you receive through a commercial pension is not financed by the monthly contributions of people who are paying in to their own personal pensions - and crucially is restricted to the value of your own contributions plus interest.

The current generation of pensioners did not contribute enough via National Insurance Contributions to fund their own pensions which due to increasing lifespans have now become unsustainable.

I don't care if pensioners feel they were led to expect a state pension they didn't need upon retirement. Every other section of society, particularly the young has had to endure cuts that they were also led to believe they would receive. Why should pensioners be treated any differently?

&gt;and might actually raise enough to be worth caring about (the state pensions of the super-wealthy do not constitute a particularly large amount, given the low number of super-wealthy people, and the small, fixed, size of state pensions).

The state-pension budget is *astronomical*. This is not some paltry sum. Huge amounts of money are being spent on state pensions for people who are not only quite capable of living comfortably without them, they are wealthier than the taxpayers who are paying for them.

1st Doctor:
 
Susan- The Doctor's granddaughter, already travelling with him when the show started. Fond of Earth and especially the 1960s. In ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" she fell in love with David Campbell and stayed on 22nd Century Earth.
 
Ian and Barbara- Teachers at Coal Hill School in the 1960s. Worried/curious about Susan so followed her back to the TARDIS after school one day. ""Kidnapped"" by the Doctor- although they enjoyed their travels they always wanted to return home and did so at the end of ""The Chase""- on Earth they had seemed to vanish for 2 years.
 
Vicki- Survivor of a spaceship crash, she was picked up by the Doctor, Ian and Barbara. Travelled with them for a while and became like a new granddaughter to the Doctor. Fell in love with Troilus in Troy and stayed there, passing into legend as Cressida.
 
Steven- Joined the TARDIS crew in The Chase. Leaves in The Savages, trying to help the Elders and the Savages live together in peace.
 
Katarina- Girl from Troy who joined the TARDIS when Vicki left. Only appeared in 2 stories before she became the first companion to  be killed off.
 
Sara Kingdom- Only arguably a companion. She was also killed off in The Dalek's Master Plan.
 
Dodo Chaplet- Wanders into the TARDIS at the end of The Massacre. A descendant of Anne Chaplet, who befriended Steven earlier in the story. Pretty much vanishes halfway through The War Machines because her contract ran out.
 
Polly and Ben- Help the Doctor fight the War Machines. First companions to witness a regeneration. Leave when they return to Earth on exactly the same day that they left.
 
2nd Doctor:
 
Jamie- Scottish piper who joins the Doctor after the Battle of Culloden. Good friends with the Doctor and only leaves when returned to Earth with his memory wiped by the Timelords.
 
Victoria- Victorian girl who joined the TARDIS after her father is killed by the Daleks. Stays with the Harris family in Fury from the Deep.
 
Zoe- Worked on a space station which is attacked by Cybermen. Leaves the TARDIS when returned to her time by the Timelords, like Jamie.

Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart- Runs UNIT from it's formation until the late 70s.

Aaand now you know why everyone's so peaceful all the time. There certainly are some hints of fascism and fear based nationalism there. They work hard to give themselves a reputation that's different from the reality. The Keeper first shows himself to The Doctor with an impressive display of power (nobody else can breach the TARDIS). It's pretty clearly stated that the source manipulator gizmo giving the keeper his power is what is keeping the peace. The whole thing just screams ""we have peace, but we sacrificed our souls for it"". 

I really liked this episode also, happens to be the first one I ever watched back in the early 80s.

In fairness to West Brom, Pulis got his tactics spot on and the players defended very well. They got a bit of luck by scoring so early, but they completely deserved the 3 points.

Some positives: Yoshida and Betrand both had very good games (it will be a shame to see Maya lose his place when Toby comes back).

Rory and the Doctor weren't talking to her for more than a couple minutes in that first room and yet a week still passed for her. Time takes on a new meaning when you know you are moving faster through it than the people trying to save you. So even while it seems like it passing like normal you know that it isn't. You would know that even it if took them a couple more minutes to save you it would still be weeks for you.  It took at most a couple hours, probably less, for the Doctor to force his way into the faster time-stream. So especially after Rory gets into her time-steam there is no reason for her to be mad at him because they didn't abandon her and she knows that. I can understand her getting mad about being alone or getting old but that wasn't why she was mad. She was mad because she decided that the Doctor and Rory abandoned her.

Not to mention the fact that no matter the time or effort it takes the Doctor had never failed to come back to her before Apalapucia :

* The Eleventh Hour
* The Time of Angels 
* Flesh and Stone
* Cold Blood
* A Christmas Carol
* Day of the Moon
* The Doctor's Wife
* A Good Man goes to War

I even had a chemistry interview! And that was despite giving no indication of wanting to study chemistry at Cambridge. I think history will be a lot broader and facilitating than G+P, but in all honesty it doesn't really matter which.

Talking to my friends who applied for science and did an extra, non science A level, most of them had offers excluding the extra. So really, Cambridge won't take it into account.

In many regards the Barnett formula is out dated and very much unfair towards the English. England doesn't have it's own devolved body which has, or will do, the right to: set a different level of tax, how they spend money, or even borrow.

While I understand it can be taken as an English vote winner. It is needed to force the removal of Westminster's centralised control of tax revenue, which it gained during the two world wars. By doing this you make the regions/states of the UK have equal power at Westminster.

Other wise England will be milked by the Nationalists. We already have this, or will. The SNP are willing to capitalise on their predicted gains in the general election.

In January the SNP said that they will support Labour if they bring in a Mansion Tax to help fund nurses in Scotland. Such a tax would greatly effect England more than it did in Scotland. Even though the Scottish parliament has the power to raise taxes to fund the S-NSH.

David Icke claims to be the son of God, taking his story at face value one would assume that we need to start taking him seriously and start worshipping him...

All of this info comes from Cage, a heavily biased pro-Islamist group that has in the past supported senior Al Queda operatives.. It's also ran by a known Islamic extremist. And left-wing websites like the OP just lap it all up without even thinking to question whether the story is truthful or not.

It's also ridiculous that we get the full blame for it. The truth is none of the still-stable Middle Eastern countries want Islamic extremists to come back to their own country. Kuwait doesn't want Islamists fermenting rebellion in their own country, of course he was banned from re-entering once the Kuwaiti authorities found out what he was up to... Presumably they were monitoring him during his 6 month stay in Kuwait and didn't like what they saw. Nobody has a right to randomly fuck off to a different country, Kuwait is well within its rights to cooperate with us and ultimately bar him from entering.

It's true that our intelligence services did fuck up, but really I don't believe even 20% of the story that's been cooked up.

[It's because natural land is being cleared to make way for cattle ranches to meet the worlds increasing demand for meat](http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/amazon/problems/unsustainable_cattle_ranching/)

&gt; Extensive cattle ranching is the number one culprit of deforestation in virtually every Amazon country, and it accounts for 80% of current deforestation (Nepstad et al. 2008). Alone, the deforestation caused by cattle ranching is responsible for the release of 340 million tons of carbon to the atmosphere every year, equivalent to 3.4% of current global emissions. Beyond forest conversion, cattle pastures increase the risk of fire and are a significant degrader of riparian and aquatic ecosystems, causing soil erosion, river siltation and contamination with organic matter. 

I'll let you look for the study their citing if you're also interested. As for the other issues they mention which you consider bias:

**climate change** and **air pollution**

[Eating less meat essential to curb climate change](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/03/eating-less-meat-curb-climate-change)

&gt; The global livestock industry produces more greenhouse gas emissions than all cars, planes, trains and ships combined...

&gt; Appetite for meat is rocketing as the global population swells and becomes more able to afford meat. Meat consumption is on track to rise 75% by 2050, and dairy 65%, compared with 40% for cereals. By 2020, China alone is expected to be eating 20m tonnes more of meat and dairy a year.

&gt;[Two recent](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-014-1104-5) [peer-reviewed studies](http://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2353.epdf?referrer_access_token=wdppQoTTogUEJRScDj3c59RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NlteOOXpRG5bZ0W0svZ8g2c428ui7nBJcNYmaQvXtKPJpoxhXtBHQyMkLcIT5zQDX-5ve-a9N6ATC8bTLzfDUl&amp;tracking_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fenvironment%2F2014%2Fdec%2F03%2Feating-less-meat-curb-climate-change) calculated that, without severe cuts in this trend, agricultural emissions will take up the entire world’s carbon budget by 2050, with livestock a major contributor. This would mean every other sector, including energy, industry and transport, would have to be zero carbon, which is described as “impossible”

**fresh water scarcity** and **water pollution**

[Lower meat consumption will help water scarcity issues](http://www.foodnavigator.com/Science/Lower-meat-consumption-will-help-water-scarcity-issues-say-researchers)

[Meat Is the Biggest Waste of Water](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/mimi-bekhechi/meat-is-the-biggest-waste-of-water_b_1428558.html)

&gt; It takes, on average, 15,500 litres of water to produce one kilogram of beef. To put this in context, that is the equivalent of 50 baths of water to produce one steak - 15 times more water than is needed to produce one kilogram of wheat. To produce the diet of a typical meat-eater takes the equivalent of 5,000 litres of water per day

&gt; These revelations have led to an influential UN report naming the livestock sector ""one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global"". The 2006 report, Livestock's Long Shadow, highlighted freshwater scarcity among the many environmental problems and called the livestock sector ""a key player in increasing water use"" and ""probably the largest sectoral source of water pollution.""

Bonus subheading **Eating meat is unsustainble and using land and grain for meat production contributes to starvation**

Here's [an article from 2004](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3559542.stm) that explains why.

&gt; The World Water Week in Stockholm will be told the growth in demand for meat and dairy products is unsustainable.

&gt; Animals need much more water than grain to produce the same amount of food, and ending malnutrition and feeding even more mouths will take still more water.

The environmental damage caused by our meat heavy diet is huge and well documented, it's something climate scientists have been warning about because it is vital that we eat less meat to combat climate change, and the grain we feed to animals could feed billions if people could eat it instead. I'm surprised you were apparently completely unaware of this.

Anyway back to the original issue

&gt; Please read the literature I have linked in the previous post.

&gt;  I agree welfare standards could be improved, however ""most of the meat 'meat-eaters' eat"" has no suffered its entire life as you say.

As far as I can see you haven't shown that animals produced for meat don't suffer, you've linked to some welfare standards, you've explained the rationale for debeaking (which I already knew). These are things that are meant to address suffering to some degree, but IMO intensive farming of animals is always going to cause suffering, the minimum standards don't actually meet the RSCPAs minimum standards for the animals not to suffer, stuff like debeaking in chickens and teeth clipping in pigs are meant to reduce the risk of the animals from injuring each other in the cramped, stressful, unnatural conditions in which they are forced to live, it doesn't mean they still aren't suffering.",null,0,null,1425148711,null,0,1425149318,0,cp03iy7,null,t3_2xga3z,null,t1_cp03iy7,null,t1_cp01qdv,null,null,null,1427505879,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I was taught in Roman Catholic schools until I was 16, and it really annoyed me how much time was wasted by going to church and stuff like that when I could be learning or doing fun things.

I do think religion should be taught as an (optional) subject, but more for historical reasons or to learn about culture in other parts of the world such as the middle east.

We've all seen the damage that religion can do with the Islamic schools here in the UK which banned music, dancing and separated girls from boys. There's no place for that in a modern society.

A lot of companies are setting up a separate ""Digital"" division for this job, hived off from traditional IT.

Traditionally, IT is internal-facing applications for staff to use. Increasingly what organisations need are external facing systems -- i.e., web and apps for end-users. That requires a different approach, different technologies and different skills. It's more exploratory, uncertain and relies on iterative release cycles and continuous response to customer feedback and online trends. It needs more product design and User Experience skills than companies previously required for their IT.

Organisations used to keep their IT literally out of the way in the ""back office"". Now to be successful online they have to integrate their marketing/PR, sales/front office and their technical teams together to make apps etc. that work well and people actually want to use.

null,false,Mutangw,null,null,null,"&gt;Is there any evidence that swearing in a witness, whether affirming or on a holy book, has any bearing on the honesty of their answers?

The only way to find out either way is to have each court abandon the oath in every other court case, and keep the oath for the other half. And then somehow figure out who was lying and who wasn't, how would one even do that apart from by surveying them afterwards? 

The issue is courts are not a place for scientific experiments such as that, for obvious reasons, such an experiment would cost billions because of the inevitable appeals alone. Imagine if a witness lied and then tells the survey people that he lied. The defendants solicitors could easily demand that information and get a re-trial. The oath is simply a tradition that has stuck, and there's no evidence that it causes any harm, so there isn't any reason to get rid of it.

Courts are a very formal and traditional setting, and ceremonial things like swearing an oath are deliberately intended to make people understand what a serious setting it is. The idea is it keeps people in line and the power dynamics make it more difficult for people to lie convincingly.

There are very legitimate concerns on how this money is spent as much of it goes on Zakat to Islamic charities supporting dubious causes which have been linked with terrorist groups.

This sounds like a good argument for regulating charities that support terrorism. If you have a list, you should let the charity commission know. They'll lose charitable status. 

&gt; it creates workplace discrimination as the slaughtermen have to be Islamic that would never be tolerated in other occupation. 

Fair point, can't really get too worked up about that one. The same holds true for the kosher meat I had to eat at school when I was growing up in North London

Why should non-Muslims have to bend to the sensibilities of an intolerant, imported culture?  It should be them who adapt to our way of  life, not the other way around.

Ah yes, intolerance. Nasty stuff that. Personally I'm happy to tolerate eating meat that's being mumbled over - it doesn't affect me and it doesn't constitute bending over backwards.

Nolan are not the best out there, in terms of quality or post sales support. 

If it's been dropped to concrete from any height it's probably better to be safe than sorry. Carpet or a softer surface it's probably ok. 

The thing is the helmet has done what it's supposed to; the outer shell spread the load from a small point of impact at the contact patch, spread that load over a wider area to transmit the force over more surface area and absorb some energy. 

But its main purpose was to flex inwards and spread the load further into the polystyrene inner which deforms and further absorbs energy. 

With your head in it, flush against this inner shell then the same process happens, your skull deflects the load from this wider area than the impact point over an even wider area, further reducing the energy then transferred to the meningal fluid sac your brain sits in. 

Any remaining energy sloshes the brain from one side of the brain case to the other. 

In a lower energy impact where all these layers perform optimally your brain will slow enough in its viscous sac that it won't be impacted against the skull. 

If the energy is higher than can be absorbed by these layers your brain might be squooshed against the impact side as it stays still as your skull hits into it, then the energy passed rebounds the soft tissue and the brain is smashed against the opposite side. Bash it too hard and it bruises; concussion. Bash it harder still or multiple times and brain or brain sac might split; significant risk of brain injury. 

Its like a yolk in the middle of an egg, millions of years of evolution have created your skull as a case that is designed to protect the precious innards from the sort of impacts you could expect at speeds of no more than 20mph and heights of about one storey. Modern life challenges those performance parameters quite considerably. Helmets are designed to work with the same principle as the skull but add further energy absorption to narrow that gap,hopefully to survivability levels. 

Compromise that extra protection even a little and the remaining performance may not be enough should the worst happen. Or it may be fine for another impact that does not exceed the remaining absorption. 

So actually if your head is in it your skull acts as a layer in the system and limits how much the polystyrene deforms. Without your head in it the outer shell flex will push the inner in further. It then rebounds leaving an imperceptible cavitation in the polystyrene which stays deformed having done it's job in absorbing the energy. Think about when you hit an egg but don't quite break it. It stays deformed, that's exactly what happens to the unseen inner padding that's designed to absorb the most energy. Its now compacted and transfers more force through the increased area of density. 

Hitting it again on this weakened spot has a higher risk of catastrophic failure for the outer shell as it will meet less resistance when it flexes in and has micro fractures in the fibreglass weave when it flexed last time. This is compounded by the absence of polystyrene underneath this, more space before it is supported by the inner lining, which itself is now deformed to a dense patch and will transfer more force. 

So, maybe it's all ok. Maybe the same spot won't be hit again. Maybe the damage is only minor and the impact it receives next time is not enough for catastrophic failure but you get concussion when a new undamaged lid might have given you a headache. The reason the advice is to replace rather than risk it is because it's practically impossible to know. Its a consumable that once it's done it's job, even only partially then in theory less remains should it be required to work at its maximum design capabilities. 

Source: worked motorcycle industry for 14 years including 3 years selling Helmets and doing the Shoei and Arai training a number of times. 

However, pragmatically and speaking from experience I dropped my first Shoei loads, crashed in it a couple of times (nothing major) and didn't replace it. No ill effects but maybe I was lucky. Not sure I'd trust a Nolan polycarbonate shell in the same way but if it's a fibre/carbon model you might want to risk it too. 

tl;dr I typed all this out on a phone, read it, it might save your life. 

Alternative tl;dr you can't tell, up to you if you want to risk it

It was May of 2009. I was living in Los Angeles at the time. I had just finished watching the FA Cup final against Chelsea when I decided to take a quick nap.


Four hours later I woke up. Everything was dark, except for the glow from my fireplace. *Wait a minute* I realized I didn't start a fire at all today. I jumped up in my seat and looked around the darkness, but didn't see a thing. As my head swiveled back there was a portly man standing in front of me. Pretty sure my heart skipped like nine beats. 

The man stared at me. He was wearing a long coat and had Matrix style sunglasses. Which was odd, considering how dark it was.

""Hello. My name is Bill Kenwright. You have been chosen.""

Before I could get a word in edgewise, he dropped a yellow card on the table in front of me. I looked at it then looked back up only to find he had disappeared! In a state of shock, I picked up the yellow card and found writing on it.

""You have been chosen. Arrive at Goodison on the next full moon. Come alone.""

Then the card disintegrated...

I collapsed back into my chair out of shock when I noticed something cutting my thigh. I reached in my pocket and found it was a plane ticket to Liverpool. How did that get there?

Needless to say I obliged the offer and found myself at Goodison. I wandered around the park wondering where I was supposed to go until I found a door with my name on it. I tried the handle, it was unlocked.

The door led to a narrow, cavernous tunnel. I followed the path. The way was lit by torches (the American kind) hanging on the wall along the way. I also noticed some strange writing on the walls, but I was so nervous I didn't stop to read it. Out of the corner of my eye I could make out words like ""Nil Satis...""

I reached the end of the passageway unscathed, and it led to a set of stairs with a hatch on top. I opened up the hatch and found myself on the pitch! Right on the center spot. 

The place was lit up by the full moon but there was still a mist to the ground. A cold wind came and sent a shiver up my spine. Then I noticed there were shadows approaching me- 12 men in robes like monks, walking with their heads down towards me. They placed themselves evenly along the center circle surrounding me. One of them stepped forward and revealed his hood.

It was Bill. ""Welcome. You have been chosen...""

In unison, the other 11 men finished his sentence, ""not manufactured.""

Upon this another strong gust of wind came. It whistled through the trees, only this time it whistled a haunting tune that I would later come to know as Z Cars. A thousand ghosts filled the stands, a few of them I now recognize. There was Dixie Dean in Gwladys!

Then another robed figure stepped forward and revealed himself. It was Tony Hibbert.

""Repeat after me:""

&gt; *Night gathers, and now my watch begins.*


&gt; *It shall not end until my death.*

&gt; *I shall take no other teams,*

&gt; *Hold no other parks,*

&gt; *Father only Evertonians.*

&gt; *I shall wear no other crests,*

&gt; *And win only Everton glory.*

&gt; *I shall live and die a Blue.*

&gt; *I am the sword on the pitch.*

&gt; *I am the watcher on Gwladys.*

&gt; *I am the crest that guards the Fabric.*

&gt; *I pledge my life and honor to Everton,*

&gt; *For this night and all nights to come.*

As soon as I finished the oath, all in attendance on the pitch and in the stands chanted in unison:

""And so he is chosen.""

Bill stepped forward. This time he had an iron in his hand. I realized it was a branding tool. But I was no longer scared. I was at peace. I knew this is where I belonged. He branded with me with the official crest. I didn't think anything of it, until I realized last year that the scar on my body changed as the crest changed (which is why, I imagine, so many people were furious about the design).

With that, I found myself back in LA almost instantaneously. If not for the scar I would have thought it all a dream.

So ya, coming up on my 6 year anniversary of being chosen.

Still have a lot of concerns about him, but he's had a wildly successful loan and he deserves an opportunity to get a real look during pre-season. Might be that he's just not good enough but can have a good career at a lower level. 

Carroll I think is probably about done at Spurs. Extremely likable guy but I don't think he has the tenacity for the way Pochettino wants the central midfielders to play. Mason may be sloppier with his general passing but he takes more risks and has a higher performance ceiling on a per-game basis. Carroll is tidier and probably would recycle possession better but he doesn't create as much as Mason either with his movement or with aggressive passing. The Swansea fans have all compared him to Britton and Allen, whereas Spurs fans for some reason have this image of him as a Modric type player. I think Bentaleb already gives us what Carroll does and so much more. 

I really really like Winks and Onomah from what I've seen and would think they're next on the academy central midfield conveyor belt, particularly Winks who I think has more about him than Carroll. It's a crowded position and we'll surely look to sell a few this summer.

Moffat is a great storyteller... the problem is that he doesn't know when to stop. He needs someone to pull the breaks.

He needs someone to stop him... On Sherlock his also great, because Mark Gatiss keeps it real... But when he's left alone, he just keep going... doing things more and more bizarre... until you can't watch anymore. Look what he made of the Weeping Angels... Great villains... But the bloody Statue of Liberty? That's makes no sense what so ever... It's only one example where he's full of inconsistencies.

And he keep trying to make it bigger... and more complicated... and more epic... that in the end he just Deus ex Machina the hell out of, without explaining anything.

You have to be careful, not only with sources from Wikipedia and the ""Libertarian"" right - people like Bryan Caplan and Donald who have been extensively debunked, but also with some Spanish sources.  The atrocities of the fascists were extensively covered up in Spain, including the crimes for which the church was to blame, and the republican crimes heavily exaggerated for decades after the leftists and centralists lost.  Even today, a large part of the Spanish establishment has real problems acknowledging their fascist past and continue to believe the same things that led to Franco and all his horrors.  

The anarchists/libertarians pursued no organised ""terror"" at all, and there is no credible evidence that they did.  What did occur, and it's reprehensible but not inhuman, were sporadic and small scale revenge attacks, largely during and in the aftermath of battles.

Don't do this, you don't want to depend on other people for access to your money.

Work out what your goals for the next couple of years are, just roughly. e.g

Learn to drive approx £500- £750

Buy a car £1500 - £3000

Insurance £1500

2 week Holiday when 18 £1000-£2000

To do these things you'll need access to your money, perhaps you'll have a part-time job and be earning money?

I was readin through this post and felt I had to reply to give another option, have you looked at buying?

I moved out 5 years ago with my girlfriend and started renting, first a flat at £450 then a house at £500 and finally another at £650. All in the space of three years, we had children in this time but found it impossible to save for a deposit once renting. We bought our current house only because my father helped us financially,  we spent £89,950 with an £9000 deposit. (Id go in to detail but it is painful typin on this thing!)

Anyway I looked at what you could buy from the name of where you live above and found this..http://www.rightmove.co.uk/s6p/33379395

As an example you could offer £55000, use £5500 deposit plus fees and roughly at a rate of 3.9% be paying £230 a month as repayment over 35 years. Youd be on the ladder, be able to save more now and use the flat as an investment instead of losing all your savings on rent/ffurnishing etc etc as it will be used.

If you have any questions I will try to reply, like I say it was just a thought and something I wish id have done before renting.

That is all assuming the developers play fair and actually offer the houses at 20% less than they intended to sell them. Who is to say what the exact value of a house in a new development should be? What is to stop them inflating the price such that the 20% off price is actually what they were going to charge in the first place.

There is no shortage of first time buyers who can afford to pay full price, the ones lucky enough to have parental help. The houses will certainly sell at full price.

So what will end up happening is wealth will be transferred from ordinary tax payers to wealthy property developers.

Reasons:

Friedel - We need some experience

Yedlin - I feel like giving him his debut would be really good in such a crucial game. Also he's american.

Kaboul - Big, strong and reliable. He's also the captain so we can't really play without him.

Chiriches - Can do his tricks all night. I think he's gonna get at least 2 goals.

Vertonghen - Our best shot at left back. I like him playing extra wide since that will allow him to make good runs.

Eriksen - Of course we need to have somebody with good freekicks in the team. I put him at DM since I think he will be able to transition the ball from the defense and into the opponents' goal.

Capoue - Consistent, hard-working and loves the club. No slacking here.

Paulinho - He's brazilian so he should work on the wing

Soldado - We saw how good Soldado's playmaking ability was in the Fiorentina match, so I believe he'll flourish in Eriksen's old role.

Winks - Played well on his debut and deserves another game.

Adebayor - Has always been a workhorse and it's good having somebody who loves the club fighting in such an important game.",null,0,null,1425157089,null,0,1425164855,0,cp07kdj,null,t3_2xgg99,null,t1_cp07kdj,null,t3_2xgg99,null,null,null,1427507833,null,16,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,16,null
