Right - you keep telling yourself you're above nationalism, yet hold the same opinions of a nationalist. Looks like a duck...

&gt;Christ you are thick. I'll be honest, I don't pick fights with you here. I actually try to leave regular unionists alone even if I might disagree. I just rolled my eyes when others complained but you are ridiculous wannabe victim.

I take issue with your point of view. I happen to think it's routed in nationalism despite what your protests. Thick? lol yeah I've a different view of your politics, deal with it.

&gt;Most people want to change it to just the short name to put an end to it. It will happen eventually. People will move on like nothing happened. To get worked up about it stems directly from nationalist sentiment. 

This is delusional. 'Most people want to change it'. Your opinion. 'to just the short name to put an end to it.' Your opinion. 'It will happen eventually.' Your opinion. And based on what, chucky ar la? 'People will move on like nothing happened'. Learned nothing from the city hall flag I see. And yet it's not you espousing nationalist view because you 'only want a short name'. Nothing to do with picking a side there I'm sure...

Clearly if you were really holding a non-nat viewpoint you'd see that the city name can't be changed by the council, that SF + the SDLP are wasting ratepayers money getting a result they already know and additionally the comments leading up to this waste of time are worrying from a shared city pov - 'the city needs a single identity'. 

Going out on a limb here but I'd say the fact you'd risk the success story of Derry~Londonderry due to some meaningless 'handiness' of a shorter official name puts you firmly in the nat camp on that issue.

&gt;As I said FG is considered the most protestant of all the parties. They disproportionately get the protestant vote and have more protestant members than the others. It goes back to when southern unionists started voting for Cumann na nGaedheal after independence.

The defining characteristic of southern unionists in Irish politics has been to ignore it. While it's thought FG get the 'protestant vote' simply because historically FF are more nationalistic, the numbers are unclear. Either way to call FG 'most protestant' is like saying the provos are more protestant than the dissidents. Generally speaking they are not 'protestant' in any shape or form.

&gt;My gripe with her is mainly the farcical nepotism she got herself involved in with regard to the art museum boards. 

The southern state is awash with the favouritism that makes headline news if discovered in NI. Look towards the end of each minister's tenure and you'll usually see a litany of handouts to party supporters. Eg Keaveney buying a €2m plot of land for €6m from FF party supporters prior to getting ousted from government.

&gt;The 1905 revolution involved street fighting in Petrograd. Hence the strategic influence.

Is this a joke? A violent revolution involved street fighting is to be regarded as strategic? Not many revolutions the Easter rising didn't manage to draw inspiration from then.

&gt;The Dublin workers weren't strong enough unionists because they made no impact on the history of the city worth mentioning. If they were strongly unionist there would have been significant conflict in the city over it.

Unionists were a minority in the city. Working class unionists, while undoubtedly more numerous than the elite, would still have been dwarfed by the wider (nationalist) electorate. Saying their convictions ""weren't strong enough unionists"" because they didn't come up with some armed insurrection (they did contribute to the UVF however) is just refusing to acknowledge history because you happen not to agree with their beliefs. 

In fact your description of unionists in both this historic context and the naming of the city (if I may generalise for a second from protestants) is simply that our views shouldn't be taken on board as 'they aren't strong enough'.

And sometimes religion sneaks its way into school, even though there is supposed to be a separation of school and state.  For example, a prayer is said before assemblies and other school functions.  I think in some of the more rural schools prayers are said before lunch.  This is in my area, anyway, which is really quite rural.

We do have schools, though, including an adorable one-room schoolhouse leftover from when our town was just a tavern and a few farms.  It's called ""Possum Trot School.""  It's not a functioning school, but rather an symbol of the town's beginnings.

South Carolina is at the bottom in national rankings for education.  My community does not respect education much, sadly.  There is a community effort currently to raise standards locally.

effect to around 110,000.

I think a lot of people (particularly American fans) greatly misunderstand who DW is made for. Unlike Game of Thrones, Star Trek and other long running cult tv shows, DW isn't made with special attention to its fan's desires/opinions about what the show should be doing. It is made principally for the average British family on a Saturday evening and it has been for decades. It occupies a special place in the nation's heart and it is for the nation it is made, despite the fact that most people drift in and out and are not 'mega fans' as it were. This is why it doesn't have a complicated lore or an intricate map of the societies and cultures that exist in its universe. It's made mostly for people who simply enjoy seeing it on a Saturday evening! This allows the show to be greatly more flexible in what it does. I think we fans fail to see that it isn't made for us, its made for the mainstream viewer, and I hope that it never pays too much attention to its own cult viewership,because it would lose its core. Also, part of Russel T. Davies' itch to bring back DW was that it would focus mostly on the Earth to broaden its appeal beyond the cult which stayed with it after its cancellation. So that is a great reason as to why it centers on the Earth and as for Britain, the British are its core demographic.

No one is born knowing all this stuff - the only ignorant people are those who don't ask questions.

I think it would be wise for you to do a few things...

* Start tracking how much you spend. You can use an app or a spreadsheet - but monitor where *every* penny goes.  That will help you get an idea of where you waste money.
* Get an ISA.  Commit to sticking a fixed amount in there each month, say £50.  If one month you have to choose between a new pair of shoes and topping up your ISA - stick the money in the ISA.  This will help build financial discipline and give you the satisfaction of seeing your pot of money growing.
* Have a serious think about what your options are in the future. Do you want to go travelling? University? Get a job? Move in with your girlfriend? You don't need to decide now - but you should spend a few hours researching what each of those options will cost you.  When you're faced with the dilemma of whether to buy a PS4 or stick the money away - remember what your goal is and how much more satisfaction you will gain from achieving it.
* Finally, remember that money is merely a tool.  It's up to you to use it wisely.

&gt; reductions  in tax  credits  and  housing  benefits  – the  largest  effect  – reach  £0.8 billion in 2020-21

&gt; higher unemployment  and  lower profits  lead  to  further increases  in borrowing

Do you know why Labour lost the 2015 election? Because in 2011, Lab assumed that the economy would *not* recover and went ahead and made a bunch of policy statements and predictions.

The economy then did recover starting in 2013 - and the voters looked at the predictions and said ""Well Labour said X would happen, and it didn't, this must mean they are idiots"". We don't know if the economy recovered because of Conservative actions, because the USA recovered and dragged us up with them or because economies always recover by themselves as people's animal spirits reassert themselves. Probably a combination of the latter two. But Lab was left badly exposed by not understanding that and spouting off too early.

Same thing with Ed Miliband's energy freeze. It looked like a good idea when he spouted it two years before the election - and then gas and energy prices collapsed and it looked to the voter that the govt had sorted the problem out. So why bother with Ed?

I think you'd need to show at least 10,000 'entryists' to start taking the theory seriously.

And once the entryists get power, they tend to use it to exclude more moderate voices.  And they also tend to push for more and more ideological purity - purging the ranks of dissenters.

True. There are unquestionably more good developers too, though. I wonder if the ratio has changed at all.

&gt; The average C developer is probably much better today than in the past though

I wonder how true this is. On the one hand, we have learnt a _lot_ over the decades about writing safe C, and created a lot of amazing tools for analysing it. On the other hand, there's a shortage of C developers, and very few new programmers are turning their hand to it. Many people developing C have been doing it a long time and aren't up to speed on newer practices like automated testing or static analysis.

&gt; It takes some thought but any decent developer is thinking about resource life time before they go ploughing in with malloc calls all over the place

It is hard. Don't confuse ""the program works and has no memory leaks"" with ""the program is correct"". The best C programmers in the world routinely create (and miss when reviewing code) memory management errors that turn into exploitable security flaws.

Levy has since come out (after the Berbatov saga) and said that he doesn't plan to sell [top Spurs talent] to Premier League competition. So far, he has stayed true to his word, and that has been 7 years.

You would imagine that *if* Lloris was sold, it would be to either Real Madrid or PSG.

If Man Utd place a bid for Lloris before Real Madrid get De Gea, and it gets rejected, then you would imagine they wont sell De Gea. In which case, Real Madrid may seek out Lloris.

null,null,brokenairguitar,flair5,,null,"&gt; Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood has refused to rule out reviving a deal for Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor.
&gt; 
&gt; Adebayor, 31, had been in talks over a loan move with Villa -- and was given a tour of their training ground -- but the deal has stalled.
&gt; 
&gt; Sherwood worked with Adebayor at White Hart Lane and had targeted him to beef up his forward line, despite the arrivals of Jordan Ayew and Rudy Gestede following Christian Benteke's exit. And the boss insisted the deal is not dead for the Togo international.
&gt; 
&gt; ""If it can be revived and we think it's necessary two parties have got to agree on it. At the moment there's no agreement and he's a Tottenham player,'' said Sherwood, ahead of Saturday's Premier League trip to Bournemouth.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I am really happy with the four we have here at the moment but if there is something that becomes available and it's better than what we've got then you look to improve. It would have to be some good quality of striker to be better than what we have.
&gt; 
&gt; ""It's unfair for me to talk about him, he's a Tottenham player and I can't speculate on where he might go. He's still their player and that's it.
&gt; 
&gt; ""He was here and we spoke but he's a Tottenham player. We had discussion and he's still a Tottenham player so something went wrong.''
&gt; 
&gt; Sherwood also confirmed he will assess a number of his new signings ahead of the trip to Bournemouth before selecting his side to make sure they are ready for the Premier League, while defender Jores Okore is out with a knee injury.

&gt;In 1975, there was widespread press coverage of a Labour Party report into the entryist tactics of Militant.[5] Between 1975 and 1980, attempts by Reg Underhill and others in the leadership of the Labour Party to expel Militant were rejected by its National Executive Committee, which appointed a Militant member to the position of National Youth Organiser in 1976 after Militant had won control of the party's youth section, the Labour Party Young Socialists.[6]

&gt;In 1982, after the Liverpool Labour Party adopted Militant's strategy to set an illegal deficit budget, a Labour Party commission found Militant in contravention of clause II, section 3 of the party's constitution which made political groups with their own ""Programme, Principles and Policy for separate and distinctive propaganda"" ineligible for affiliation.[7] Militant was proscribed by the Labour Party's National Executive Committee in December 1982, and the following year five members of the Editorial Board of the Militant newspaper were expelled from the Labour Party. At this point, the group claimed to have 4,300 members.[8] Further expulsions of Militant activists followed. Militant policies dominated Liverpool City Council between 1983 and 1987 and the council organised mass opposition to government cuts to the rate support grant. 47 councillors were banned and surcharged.[9][10] The conduct of the Liverpool council led Neil Kinnock, Labour's then leader, to denounce Militant at the 1985 Party Conference. Eventually Militant's two remaining Labour MPs were prevented from being Labour candidates at the 1992 general election.",null,0,null,1438953555,null,null,false,0,ctuqoxx,null,t3_3g4a71,null,null,null,t1_ctuqmj3,null,null,null,1440337227,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,null,reevej91,null,null,null,"I just don't buy it. He hasn't been a top level striker for a good while now if we're being honest. His goal ratios from previous seasons are that high due to him taking penalties and netting a few free kicks. The thing with Mario is he looks great in fractions of the game. For a few minutes he'll press or make solid runs and you'll think to yourself, hey maybe he's turned the corner, maybe he's finally settling in. Then the next thing you know he looks lost or gotten into a scuffle with an opposing player for some odd reason. Balo's had troubles working with coaches, fitting in, etc everywhere he's gone. Why should we put blame on Rodgers when other managers have struggled working with him as well?   

For me Balo was an entity unto himself all last year. Reports of missing training numerous times. A wildcard attitude on the pitch. He's clearly the Mario Balotelli show. And without the production - or even the appearance of trying to play Rodger's way - makes the whole media circus a cross between annoying and sad. 

So no, I don't think Balo suddenly became a worse player, but I do think he's been quite overrated for some time. And I'll agree with you that Liverpool don't play such an unusual brand of football that changes couldn't have been made. But seeing that the manager thought leading the line with Sterling instead of Balo makes me think there was evidence on display at Melwood that led Rodgers to make that move. I'll concede that BR probably knows more about managing a squad than I will probably ever know. Maybe the boss didn't fail at getting his ""only functional striker"" into the team because Balo was not and likely is not a functional striker. It seems plausible.

null,null,scuzzmonkey69,null,null,null,"&gt; I think the key thing is that regardless of how the bailout was structured, it is clear enough from the terminology that is was structured as a bailout, not an investment -- this is what you are not addressing.

I feel like we're starting to go round in circles - as mentioned before - one of the alternative forms of bailout would be to ensure the assets/debts of RBS while letting the company still fold. In that scenario no one with money in, owed money to, or was owed money by, would lose out, but RBS as an entity would cease to exist. But that isn't what happened, so again there must be some value in keeping RBS as an entity. That, in and of itself, is an investment; if you really want to put it in those terms.

Ultimately my point comes down to this, there are many different ways to structure a bailout. The type that was chosen involved purchasing a large proportion of RBS in a way that allows money to be recovered when selling that share. That in and of itself is a type of investment, even if it was never expected to recover the money.

But, what needs to be asked is this; if there was never an intent to recover the money, then why structure the bailout in the way that they did?",null,0,null,1438953801,null,null,false,0,ctuqt2z,null,t3_3fv513,null,null,null,t1_ctumw9y,null,null,null,1440337282,null,1,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

It's pointer semantics allow Rust to be as fast as Fortran (or C with pervasive use of restrict, but I don't think I've ever seen C written that way).

Java has exactly the same FFI issues and I'd argue that unsafe rust is still much safer than C as all the checks and balances remain, even in unsafe blocks.

The number of people receiving grants increased from 2.4 million in 1998 to 16 million in 2011. In terms of the number of grant recipients and the proportion by type of grant, the largest are made up of the child support grants (71 percent), old age grants (18 percent) and disability grants (7 percent). Others include the foster care grant and the care dependency grant.

However, your time line (or more specifically your parents' timeline) may be an issue. You can only save £2,400 each per year, together with the £1,000 opening. Therefore, it will take 4 years to reach the £12k each in the Help to Buy ISA, to get the full government £3k.

Like how when you stated nationalism in NI was stoked up by the big bad unionist businessmen.

If you remember the purpose of Lovren's purchase (at the time at least) was to bring in a Leader and Organizer to the back now that Carragher was gone (not saying Lovren worked out well).   This should tell you a little about Skrtel's leadership abilities on the pitch during a game.  Although tenure should have a little weight in the choosing the future should also weigh in, Skrtel will most likely be with the club 2 more years at most, while we see the Milner Henderson partnership lasting at least 4 (IMO).  
Lastly he doesn't communicate much on the field, I am pretty sure he and Lovren and Sakho for that matter have run into each other on WAY more occasions than when Carragher was in the side.  We need someone willing to be more vocal constantly on the field and I've seen it from Milner even in a star-studded Manchested City side where his value was not as appreciated.
Lastly,  I don't think Skrtel will take it too harshly.

null,null,sjampen,lfc99,,null,"First of all, being vocal in contrast to being quite is not the defining factor in leadership. How much or loud you communicate is not the only thing making you a good leader. I can think of no LFC player who leads by exable better than Martin Skrtel, when it comes to work ethic and professionalism. Surely, Milner will do that too, but i think you vastly underestimate the respect Skrtel has earning throughout his stay at this club. Not even Hendo works noticeably harder than Skrtel, although Hendo covers more ground. When we're down, Skrtel is the among the player stepping up and taking responsibility. 

Secondly, Skrtel is the one organizing our defense. He is the one bossing Sakho around and making sure our defensive line is on point when it comes to offsides. To call him non-vocal, is incredibly wrong.

What about a black guy making a joke about a guy in a wheel chair? Is that punching up or down? Or is that across?

I know people use it a lot but I think it's too much of a simplification to explain whether a joke is okay to make. The simplification leads all comedians to be judged on their standing in society. Or in some cases they're judged on their race or disability. Which I thought was the opposite of what we wanted.

These people are protesting for 

&gt; measures to avoid such a situation ""arising in the future"".

So censorship before the message is allowed to be broadcast. Or maybe just harsher punishment for saying the wrong thing.

I just think people are too harsh on comedians. They do a difficult thing if they want to make it an art. Controversy and pushing boundaries (societal or technical) are par for the course. It must be incredibly difficult to make someone laugh and think at the same time - that's why the greats are few and far between. 

People act like they absolutely do not need to ever hurt anyone or do something a little bit edgy for comedy. I just really disagree. If there's nowhere to push it the art form will stagnate. 

I'm not saying these things shouldn't be examined just we shouldn't forget that we love them when they're done right. It's like being angry at a drummer for missing a beat. 

Words can cause damage but we need safe spaces where all ideas can be expressed and explored. I thought that was part of what art is about. But now we are at a point where an entire comedy set which probably took months to create - where the timing of every joke is practised and polished, where the comedian is hopefully aware of how and where he is taking the audience and the context slowly builds over the set - is being shoved into someone else's context on a newspaper and we're all supposed to be outraged it is now offensive.

When I was 19 I paid £400 for a course in online marketing (8 years ago now), it was expensive for me at the time but it led me down a road and now online marketing is my main career. Best £400 I ever spent!

null,null,Doomslicer,eng-norfolk,Norwich,null,"&gt; I mean what's your angle here? 

My angle is that we've moved from paying up-front and owning something forever, to paying a slightly reduced price and paying it *forever*. And tied in with this is the top-down control this affords the owners.

Imagine, if you will, that you purchase a sci fi movie on DVD. [Then the creator and owner decides to re-release a 'new improved' version with lots of janky changes that nobody wanted and nobody likes](http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/aug/19/star-wars-blu-ray-lucas). With a DVD, that's fine. You have the old unaltered version of the movie you like, noone's going to come marching into your house, pull the original off your shelf and replace it with the new CGI special edition. If you're renting/using digital distributed streaming? Welp. The owner gets what the owner wants. Your purchase is subject to change based on forces beyond your control.

And Netflix has to regularly renew contracts to host content. What happens when a reboot happens and the IP owners decide not to renew the hosting contract for a previous version? Woop. Gone. When it's just not pulling in enough views to justify the hosting cost? Woop. Gone. There's a whole web community that tracks what's leaving Netflix soon. And it's not just schlock that falls off the catalogue. [Look what's going off the catalogue this month](http://www.whats-on-netflix.com/leaving-soon/netflix-titles-expiring-on-netflix-in-august-2015/). Titanic! Unbreakable! Chittyshittybangbang! Fifth Element! Face/off!

So say we sit down and think, hey, let's watch Avengers : Assemble. Wait, no, not in the catalogue, despite being one of the biggest films ever. Ok. Well Iron Man was the most fun character in that franchise anyway. Let's watch the Iron Man movies. Wait, no. Iron Man 2 and 3 are on there, but not the first film, 'Iron Man'. Oh man, I'm really feeling the scope of the incredible selection.

So let's do some of the biggest movies and franchises. Lord of the Rings? Nope. Hobbit? Only the second film. Avatar? No. Jaws? No. Hunger games? Only the *second* film. Frozen? No? Skyfall? No. The new Star Treks? Only the second one. Harry Potter? Nope. Toy Story? Nope. I'm *drowning in good films*.

So maybe netflix sucks for films? How about Amazon prime/instant video? I have no idea - they've made it pretty impossible to browse the catalogue externally. Same goes for sky's NowTv. What a great system this is!

So you're paying a sub for what is possibly not a great selection. A selection they can change at will. That they can pull and deny whenever they want. Is that enough control? No? What about when companies begin to ask you to use proprietary boxes that keep an eye on you to make sure you can't show a film to *too many of your friends at once*? Not wacky conspiracy, [paid for Microsoft patent](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121105/21564420943/microsoft-patents-tv-that-watches-back-counts-heads-charges-admission.shtml).

The advances in tech are being used and will continue to be used to raise the money they make out of you while also taking control away from you.

And this is just streaming services. What about digital purchases and downloads. All the films you buy on Amazon Prime, all the games bought on Steam. What happens when those companies fold? When auth servers are shut down and the producers don't think it's worth the time to prod out a quick patch to disable the DRM? You and your purchases are at the mercy of a third party. Note that even with physical media, most games now need digital auth, putting you in basically the same boat anyway.

&gt; If I find at a point in my life I'm not watching many movies, I'll cancel it. If I want it again... guess what? I'm free to start paying them again.

And this is fine. But you have to accept that you are willing to pay over and over again to be allowed to re-access content you've already paid to access before.

I think we may be very different people in that it sound like you are a *voracious* consumer of media. I probably don't listen to two albums' worth of new music every month, and I *definitely* don't watch two new movies a week, or anything even close to that.

If you rapidly consume films and music once and then toss it away, that's fine, that's up to you how you enjoy things. Maybe at the grand old age of 26 I'm out of touch with how the youth of today experience these things. But you've got to be aware that the producers are benefiting in ways that are not immediately obvious, but might be worthy of a little concern.

As someone who enjoys quality over quantity, enjoys the occasional re-watch of an old film I enjoy, and doesn't particularly like the idea of someone being able to re-arrange my media collection without my consent, I'm not too keen on the idea that you can buy something but not 'own' it in any meaningful way.",null,0,null,1438955631,null,null,false,0,cturpw7,null,t3_3g0g4m,null,null,null,t1_ctu3x3y,null,null,null,1440337711,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,null,the_phet,null,null,null,"As spanish, just comparing ""unemployment benefits"" is not a fair comparisson between ""what spanish people get in the UK"" and ""what british people get in Spain"". This can probably bet extended to many of the other countries.

First of all, british people in Spain according to Wikipedia there are officially 300k, unoficially 700k. The other way around, spanish people in the UK according to Wikipedia there are 100k ofiicially, unoficially it is unknown. We can assume that there are 3 more times british people in Spain than spanish people in the UK.

So how come the unemployment benefit is similar even though british people are 3 times more numerous, UK has a low unemployment rate and Spain rocks the 25%? Because most british people in Spain are retired people.

Do you know what happens with retired people? They are usually old, and they need a lot of medical attention, and the kind of medical attention they need is usually very serious. Medical attention in Spain is free/universal as happens with the NHS. So all this migrants who come to Spain to retire are actually a big hole in our economy, because that's exactly the opposite kind of people you want to receive. Considering that our economy is already crap, it doesn't help at all. This people, obviously don't claim unemployment benefit.

EDIT: I am not actually complaining about them coming to Spain, even when they stay in their micro societies and don't integrate at all in our own culture (something that we usually blame muslims for when talking about inmigration). I am OK with people moving around wherever they want. I only wanted to show some other sides of the inmigration dice.

Milner has the type of character that balances well with Hendo's/Skrtel and can really help our relatively inexperienced squad to pull through the tough moments. 

Last season we could've won at least against Man Utd or Arsenal, and we could've definitely won against Palace, West Brom and Stoke, but having such a young and inexperienced squad didn't really help us psychologically to deal with the pressure, to perform when it mattered. Lucas was injured during some of those games and Skrtel was suspended. Milner adds the calm and steel we need to keep it together and not bottle it on those type of games.

The office is full of nasty humour, and in many ways the character of David Brent is just Gervaid poking fun at himself, pointing out how ""nasty"" humour can come across completely wrong. 

The thing about comedy though is that allows society to say the things that would never actually be said in everyday life. I mean what is it about sex or violence or racism or whatever that makes them any less fair game for comedy? Comedy deals with some of the fundamental, primal instincts that humans have, shines a light on them and says ""look how ridiculous this is"".

1) We've seen this movie before, we know how it ends. There is no future in a new SDP, and everyone knows it. The same members who are dead certain Corbyn will lose in 2020 are just as certain that a new SDP would lose every election until the heat death of the universe. Anti-Corbyn members are arguably, on balance, more concerned with winning elections at any cost than the party membership as a whole, and thus they're even less likely to jump ship to a party that will never see power.

&amp;nbsp;

2) As much as it may shock people, right-wing and centre-right Labour members feel just as tribally Labour as left-wing and centre-left members. They have been in the party since its very foundation - they are not going away. Not to form their own party, and certainly not to join the Lib Dems or the Tories.

&amp;nbsp;

3) There is no reason to split the party in two. If his detractors are correct, and Corbyn is an electoral disaster in waiting, they only need to wait for their predictions to come true. If Labour loses local, Scottish, Welsh, London and European elections under Corbyn, then the limited PLP support he gained through his democratic mandate will likely crumble, and he'll be forced to resign.",null,0,null,1438956896,null,null,false,0,ctusf3j,null,t3_3g4p1h,null,null,null,t3_3g4p1h,null,null,null,1440338041,null,15,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,15,null

null,null,brokenairguitar,flair5,,null,"&gt; Aston Villa have expressed an interest in signing Aaron Lennon from Tottenham.
&gt; 
&gt; Discussions are underway over a £5million deal with manager Tim Sherwood still keen on Andros Townsend too.
&gt; 
&gt; Sherwood wants to bring in some British signings after his flurry of foreign arrivals to maintain a balance in the squad and dressing room.
&gt; 
&gt; He has made an improved offer of around £2m for West Bromwich Albion defender Joleon Lescott and wants to add Lennon who impressed on loan at Everton last season.
&gt; 
&gt; Lennon was to be offered as a makeweight in Tottenham's bid for James McCarthy but the Everton midfielder has today agreed to sign a new five-year contract at Goodison Park.
&gt; 
&gt; Lennon has one year left and was rated at £9m by Tottenham but Villa believe £5m is a fair reflection of his market value.
&gt; 
&gt; Sherwood retains an interest in Townsend too but the England winger wants to give his Tottenham career every chance and will wait to see where he fits into Maurico Pochettino's plans as the season begins.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Villa did have an interest in Barcelona's Adama Traore but don't want to pay the £12m buyout and he is leaning towards joining Stoke City after visiting their training ground on Wednesday.
&gt; 
&gt; Albion, meanwhile, have offered another year to Lescott as Tony Pulis wants him to stay but he is interested in speaking to Villa if terms can be agreed.
&gt; 
&gt; Tottenham's Emmanuel Adebayor is keen to move to another London club following the collapse of his move to Villa.

Hibs, Rangers, QotS, Falkirk will be an interesting little group of teams to follow; as they'll likely occupy the top four slots and keep things quite close for a while. St. Mirren might mix things up a bit if they get out of freefall in time.

The fact is the original bone of contention was calling illegal immigrants by the shorthand ""illegals"", which _was_ dehumanising. However, the euphemism treadmill has caught up with the full phrase ""illegal immigrant"".

Front end is probably the right thing to get into - especially if you can become really good at javascript. Most 'real' devs won't touch javascript because they think it's beneath them - and most front end types don't have the right engineering mindset to tackle javascript properly. Hence I'm seeing a real gap in the market for good front-end devs. Do you have a similar experience as a recruiter?

I had loads of trouble finding a good front end guy for the company I'm working for at the moment and ended up taking a very junior guy. (Fortunately I've just found another front end dev recently who will be joining us soon).

null,null,welshieeeee,null,null,null,"The reality is we are never moving forward under the current implementations of political ideology, we are just moving back and forth. Both parties, Labour and the Conservatives have been guilty of manipulating statistics and because of tribalist voting and swing voters, all we see is a momentum shift. Think of it as a pendulum.

We do not actually see any real change that is going to drastically improve the lives of the majority. Left wing and right wing politics are two sides of the same coin, one just identifies the masses as consumers, the other identifies them as producers. In both cases they're exploited to the gain of a group at the top who only have an interest in serving themselves. 

They can play the card again and again because under both systems people get fed up of the starvation of what they crave (left wing ideology) or they get sick of the overfeeding of what they crave (right wing ideology). This leads to swinging back and forth on the pendulum and reactionist politics based on current feeling amongst the populace. Someone starved of something will want to be fed. Someone overfed with something will not want any more. Now, if you mean they can't play the same card again in the current regime then yes, whilst that is true, they also don't really need to do so, as the figures will already be better than under the previous government, in terms of matching their political ideology.

Whilst it sounds incredibly dystopian and bleak the reality is the game is rigged from the top. However, those at the top would rather turn sects of society against one another to ensure the finger of blame is not pointed at them. For example, the housing crisis is the fault of the government's fiscal mismanagement but they're more than happy to allow immigrants to be blamed and then for immigrants to retaliate than own up to it. A divided society is a weaker society. It is not a collective society working together that is going to come together to challenge those at fault.

Divide and conquer is still at play here yet there are millions out there who fail to see it. As for the different parties, well, it's all pretty much a marketing ploy. You still get the same product but you are voting for labels and different flavours of the same end product. Just as people buy into brands like Apple and stay loyal to them, these parties are hoping people do exactly the same with them to create a core of tribalist voters who will passionately fight their corner.

In short, the entire charade allows the process to be rinsed and repeated because the general populace are starved and overfed, and the cycle of exploitation continues. 

I'll actually give you a real life example. Take Prague (a city in which I've lived) in the Czech Republic. This was a country that up until the Velvet Revolution was left wing. It was a country where people were starved of the 'freedoms' they craved. The longer this went on, the more they saw the west develop materialistically under capitalism, the more they saw the lights and the apparent glamour, the more they wanted in themselves. 

When the revolution came and the shift to the right took place, the country overfed itself with materialism because it was previously starved and craved it so much. Now places like Prague are overly touristic, with McDonalds and other brands and slogans springing up everywhere. The old soviet flag has been replaced with brands and slogans and you are expected as consumers to buy into their visions instead. A city (Prague) once starved, as was the entire Czech Republic, is now overfed to the extent that people are now complaining about it and want change back. 

This is not true freedom as people believe. Rather than being trapped in a cycle of production you are trapped in a cycle of consumerism. Governments once wanted people to produce and produce. Now they are happy for their corporate friends, who they subsidise, to produce en masse and for the people at the bottom to spend and spend in the pursuit of happiness. Meanwhile, they kill off any competition in the form of regulation, which actually favours big business as they can afford it and SME's often can't, to ensure the market's stay monopolised.

However, this materialistic fix is superficial, is not a cure for the ills of left wing ideology, and is merely a toxic attempt at providing short term fixes to long term problems. People buy cars and other material goods in the pursuit of happiness and are told to live 'the American dream' (although, its not only America thats guilty of pushing this view).  

The reality is, these materialistic goods bring us short term pleasure but never actually help us obtain happiness because to reach that state of happiness we need to be free from the stresses brought by the system in the first place. True happiness is achieved through meaningful relationships, improving the life of others and having a healthy state of mind. This constant cycle of starvation and overfeeding will never allow us to be truly happy. It is just short term appeasement which brings us brief instances of pleasure.",null,0,null,1438958613,null,null,false,0,ctutg47,null,t3_3g42e7,null,null,null,t1_ctuqs4s,null,null,null,1440338526,null,3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

What I like about the Daily show (and also the Colbert Report/Last Week Tonight/ etc.) is there humourous way in which they highlight problems in the government, media and politics. 

However, what is most concerning is that they can be extremely biased and that their target audience is clearly younger people. There is an interview with Jon Stewart where somebody asks him how the Daily Show ""separates their own political views from the content of his show"" in which he replied ""we don't"".

Whilst the majority of these shows content may be a critical analysis of an event backed up by evidence and statistics, they often throw in an opinion which the audience will then assume has been formed with the same level of analysis as an earlier part of the show.

The most recent example I can think of is from Last Week Tonight, where after a very good section on Washington DC Statehood, John Oliver covers the controversy with Lord Sewel and concludes that ""Britain pays a lot of money for the House of Lords and gets virtually nothing in return"", based solely on the comment that they ""claim a daily allowance"" and despite not discussing the legislative process of the House of Lords nor mentioning that the [expenditure per member](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030w0001.htm#13103061000734) is less than members of the House of Commons and Members of the European Parliament.

Additionally, the Daily Show is popular because politicians and news presenters can often behave in a corrupt or incompetent manner, but there are times where it feels Jon Stewart is making fun of somebody solely because he/she is a politician. The mock accent he does for Mitch McConnell and the comparison to a turtle just seem tasteless to me.

The difference being so called illegal immigrants may be escaping starvation, torture, repression and so on, and so the subject naturally carries emotional weight. 

Also they are almost exclusively Hispanic in the US and predominantly African &amp; Arabic in Europe. Using a term that could be construed as derogatory or dehumanizing about a particular group of people can easily sound quite a lot like racism.  

&gt;you can be a legal immigrant or an illegal immigrant without your value as a human being ever coming into question

I do know though that back in the day the government's specification was for communications during a nuclear attack to last long enough to activate the nuclear deterrent and launch a counter attack. This was manifested by having multiple diverse routes around the country, and into buildings. That's literally all one can hope for during a nuclear exchange - that's why they call it mutually assured destruction. There is no surviving it once it's happened, so why ruggedise phone networks?

Taiwan I know a bit more about, and there's a 'labour insurance' that you pay into while employed which apparently pays out while unemployed (not sure at what rate, though, or for how long - I know it's not indefinite). It also pays out large sums for things like work injuries or deaths in the family, the latter which is quite nice - for example, my SO's father passed away, and so one of his immediate family (his wife, two sons or daughter) are able to claim family death benefits from their labour insurance (the daughter claimed, as she had the highest salary and would get the highest payout).  The money is intended for the family for the funeral or other costs.

There's a clear difference between attraction to post-pubescent people and attraction to pre-pubescent people. I'd say that the latter is worse, and also more ""perverted"" in the formal sense. We all know what the signs of sexual maturity in the female are: menstruation, breast growth, body changes. Men are always going to be attracted to these things in young women because they're signs of health and fertility. It might be creepy and distasteful in certain circumstances, but it's, in a sense, not surprising. It's only because psychological maturity doesn't always match physical maturity that the somewhat arbitrary number sixteen has to be picked.

But that's clearly different from attraction to actual children, which is, to my mind, much more of an aberration, even if the law doesn't make a clear distinction.

Artists &amp; content producers SHOULD be paid but the middlemen can go fuck themselves as far as I'm concerned(especially the music industry). It's an old business model and it's time they moved with the times like Netflix, if it hit's their bottom line tough shit time to adapt. That's what capitalism is about right? Not lobbying for more laws.

Steam is a good example. I've never pirated a game in recent years(I don't play much to be honest but I have 300+ games on my account most of which I don't or have never played). I recently paid for a documentary VIA vimeo (I think) because I thought the content was worth it. If only Hollywood and the Music industry can get it through their thick skulls that they need to change not lobby then we can start to innovate but it will likely be without them, they have had their time.

My issue is that the actual producers of the content have received little in comparison to the beast of an industry behind it. There is no need to mass produce CD's, DVD's/Blu-Ray anymore and the internet is the perfect marketing tool. This is an example of a bully squeezing the last bit of money it can and is a perfect example of how corrupt a lot of these industries have become.

Also worth noting that in my school you were required to have your tie over a certain length, your shirt tucked in and top button done up, and your blazer on at all times. 

You could get out of that during the Summer months, when you could buy a 'summer shirt' from the school which was a short-sleeve button down with the school logo on. If you had one of those you didn't have to wear a blazer, or a tie, you could unbutton your top button and have your shirt untucked.

Like many have said, sometimes British humour can be cut and dried, a bit insulting in jest, etc but it is all in good humour, and like others have said if you can laugh at yourself you'll be seen as an 'alright lad' which means you're cool. I mean not every single person who will be wanting to be your buddy will be insulting you or something like that, but in general British humour can be very satrical or complaining. Anyway the point is you'll notice the difference, don't take anything to heart, with time you'll see how it's funny. 

To be honest if you're moving to London, London has its own culture, as well as mixed with British culture. London is very mixed with different kinds of people, which is great, you won't feel odd or lost. I mean it will take some adjusting to but it won't be so stark, as moving to an actual reclused British town. 

Just get used to saying thank you a lot and sorry, people in London doesn't matter where they are from, still have that Britishness. It will surprise you sometimes the creative ways that people will find to say these things. It's more just etiquette. The more formal you can be with someone, the more friendlier you are being to them. Even if you think you're being overly formal for the first time, in fact that breaks the ice with a lot of British people. They might look at you like ""wow"" and then laugh and be like ""yeah!.."" and feel more relaxed around you from that point on. It's better to be like that at first until you get the que from your British buddy that it's cool, than to be overly friendly at first and the British person will never tell you you're doing something wrong, they may just continue to act awkward or kinda closed around you. (one of another cultural things to note.. British people don't usually tell you if there's something wrong, you'd notice it in how they act. Although they might like to complain satrically or make those kinds of jokes around their friends, British people seldom actually complain lol. Apart from the weirdos at retail of course. Every country has that.)

Once you do get friendly with people though of course it's alright to relax and then in that case British people are very flexible, they like learning about your culture too, etc, it will feel very accepting and what not.

Yes, by mydeposits.

&gt; Are you disputing independent of the resolution service offered by the deposit protection service? 

I have tried to reach an agreement with the landlord via the estate agent but they won't accept my offer.  I am about to submit a dispute via mydeposits.

&gt; Did you stay beyond the end of your tenancy

The last day of my tenancy was 21st July.  During the purchase process for my home I received a number of target completion dates that kept getting missed.  I had hoped to move into my new place before the 22nd July but did not receive the keys to the new place until 24th July which is when I moved out of the rental property.  I had it fully cleaned on 27th July and the checkout was done at 915am on 28th July.

I kept the estate agent informed at every step of my purchase process and they never raised an objection to me staying past the 22nd July.  They had a tenant lined up to move in on the 30th July.

Therefore I was in the property for six days past the rental period.  They want rent for seven days even though the checkout was done on the seventh day.  I went back to the property on the seventh day to drop off some light bulbs and the owners were there conducting their own inspection.  I offered to give them the keys there but they said take them into the estate agents.  Due to problems with my car not starting I was not able to drop the keys off until a few days later.  The estate agent keeps telling me ""but we could have charged you rent for not dropping the keys off"".

I'm happy to pay six days rent but not seven.

&gt;  We therefore commonly object to terms that [...] require cleaning regardless of whether or not this is necessary for the tenant to comply with their normal obligations with regard to the state of the property.

I'm not sure I'm interpreting the last quoted section correctly but it *could* mean that since you wouldn't normally [in use of the property] have carpets professionally cleaned it can't be required that you have them professionally cleaned [when moving out]. Your obligation is simply to leave them ""in as good and clean a condition as it was when [...] received"". If they were professionally cleaned before you moved in the lettings agent/landlord would have to prove that they were not as clean when you moved out - what did the check out notes say?

On the other hand the term was neither vague nor unclear that you had to get the carpets professionally cleaned. You might however be able to get the amount reduced for being excessive if you have quotes for £44 less than was charged. Trying and failing because of the elevator may or may not help.

Let us know how it goes either way!

I guess if you murder someone and want to dispose of a body, a industrial shredder is the way to go.  Get those crunchy bits nicely crushed up.  Or butchering and feeding to dogs / pigs, I guess that's risky since it'll take time for them to chew it all up.

It's not stealing but I'm not sure what the ""should be illegal"" thing is about (unless you're agreeing that its status as illegal is appropriate, I guess).

The status of copyright at the moment is a joke and has led to a situation where infringing it is a matter of normal life. Sometimes the infringement is extremely unethical, other times it's just a mistake.

If someone uses a photo from the internet in a presentation at work they're (in most cases) infringing copyright. That's really not the same as stealing a book from a shop though, is it?

On the other hand if someone goes out of their way to grab a load of ebooks from the library, strip the DRM from them, compile them into a torrent, and then share them on a torrent site... Well that's not really the same either, is it? Still not legal and for most people not ethical. That said it's not *the same* as stealing even if it is illegal.

How much do you have in savings for a deposit, how much do you have in your emergency fund, how much financial history do you have -- mortgage companies are strict about the income history of self employed people.

null,null,tenancyfauxpas,null,null,null,"&gt; The estate agent keeps telling me ""but we could have charged you rent for not dropping the keys off"". I'm happy to pay six days rent but not seven.

They could do a lot worse than that. Staying in a property beyond the end of a tenancy agreement (""holding over"") is bad, **legally** your landlord has every right to charge you double rent for every single day you remained in possession of the property. I'm surprised that the letting agent and landlord are unaware of this -- or if they are aware, they're being very nice to you... -- and aren't cashing in on the (relatively serious in the world of tenancies) mistake you made.

Just pay up and move on. There's no point arguing over the few £, because absolute best case here is you save yourself £70 and worse case is they decide to take it further and realise they're missing out on hundreds and hundreds of pounds because you broke the law. 

The fact is that your letting agent and landlord were actually very reasonable when they allowed you to remain in the property because you couldn't move yet, and the fact of the matter is the carpet **was not cleaned as agreed** because the person you arranged did not carry out the work. You were aware the elevator didn't work, you should have made alternate arrangements for the work to be carried out. The landlord then came to find the property *had not be cleaned as agreed* and subsequently had to arrange for the work to be carried out themselves -- which may have cost more because it was handled at the last minute.

You're really wasting your own time and outrage on this. Pay and move on. If I was in your situation I'd be jumping at the chance to just pay £70 and have everyone forget about it. If you took this to arbitration and the landlord isn't an idiot you're going to lose a lot more from the deposit.",null,0,null,1438961606,null,null,false,0,ctuve7e,null,t3_3g4ora,null,null,null,t1_ctuupn2,null,null,null,1440339443,null,7,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,7,null

This is probably due to a difference in methodology between Lambert and Sherwood but it makes me question what was even the point of a 2 year deal.

  This is absolutely true. Some parents just don't give a toss abut actually making a contribution toward their child's education or upbringing, and expect the school or someone else to be both a teacher and parent rolled into one. 

&gt;My missus is quite shocked with how some kids behave and how parents handle the situation. Our two would just never kick off and have a fit in the supermarket, as they would be in deep shit, yet we see kids full on raging, and mothers trying to handle the situation by talking to them like they are adults, trying to do deals and explaining how its hurting 'mummies' feelings.

Urgh, this times a million. If I'd kicked off when I was a kid, my mother or grandmother would have absolutely given me hell for it. Now it seems too many kids get away with murder and their parents do a grand total of absolutely nothing about it.

In real terms stealing is stealing and copyright infringement is copyright infringement. One relates to taking something illegally the other relates to violating one of the many different exclusive rights conferred on the owner of a copyrighted work.

They relate to two different bodies of legal stuff.

That doesn't make copyright infringement okay, fine, or in other ways lovely and I wasn't defending it.

&gt;so I don't see what your comment is adding to this discussion.

What was attempting to add is that the state of copyright law at the moment is a total shambles. Stealing something is fairly clear cut but copyright infringement can happen without any intention of breaking the law. Stealing is an easy to understand crime whereas the legal code for copyright infringement is woefully outdated and doesn't take into account the kinds of situations that arise in the digital environment we have today.

Twenty years ago making a mix tape or a collage was about as far as a normal person could get with remixing other people's work (and infringing their copyright in the process). These days we have easy access to tools that let us do all sorts of things.

For example it would be relatively easy (and wouldn't involve buying any software) to get hold of several eBooks, remove the DRM, grab extracts from each, and then release it as an anthology of work online. For the person doing such a thing it would be a little hobby project that gathered together some of their favourite authors' works. From a legal perspective it would be a very similar (although quite possibly worse) crime than downloading some copyright-encumbered material from a torrent site.

Copyright infringement is a different thing for a reason. It's a mess and could really do with a serious revision (for several reasons - and not to decriminalise piracy, that's not what I'm on about).",null,0,null,1438962717,null,null,false,0,ctuw52n,null,t3_3g0g4m,null,null,null,t1_ctuvmlx,null,null,null,1440339795,null,0,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

The rent issue looks less favourable. Generally speaking the letting agent/landlord would assume day 7 would be the day to charge until since that is when you seemingly agreed to officially quit the property (by making it the checkout day). It is almost immaterial when you actually moved out and/or did the cleaning if you agreed to be in possession of the property until day 7. The only potential exception is if you made it clear you were moving out on day 6 and handed the keys in and the checkout only waited until day 7 due to the landlords availability.

null,null,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt; These banks blackmailed the government in 2008 - they effectively said ""Give us a blank cheque from the general public to cover up our mistakes or there'll be no ATM's in the cash machines within 24 hours"" and the government caved.

No they didn't. What *utter, unmitigated bollocks*. The government didn't just give them a free handout, cut a cheque and say ""don't do that again"" - they BOUGHT them out at the prevailing market rate. Fred the Shred and associated board members were summarily ejected, remaining shareholders haven't had a dividend in 8 years.

That's not a blank cheque. They wouldn't have been *allowed* to cut a blank cheque under EU State-Aid Competition laws.

&gt; Now they know they can do that there's absolutely no reason why they should behave in a sustainable way - they know no matter how badly they fuck up the government will use taxpayer money to bail them out.

Um. No. If you'd been paying attention you'd know that banks are now legally obligated to ring fence their investment arms from retail. If they do something stupid, they are no longer too big to fail. They can crater and the traders just collect their P45s on the way out. You're not going to have your current account vanish ebcause a trader played the markets and lost.

And banks are branching out, RBS will be shedding a shitload of customers with the W&amp;G branch sale. If any given bank fails, they now represent fewer customers to sort out, spreading risk (as opposed to Nationalising banking, which consolidates all risk in one place).

I find it amazing that you're a socialist who objects to the government preventing harm coming to their citizens.

Do you think they *wanted* to have to buy out the banks?

Of course they bloody didn't.

But if the ATMs and card machines are going to stop working nationally, then it is incumbent on the government to step in. That's what it exists for. More than 50% of government spend is social welfare, healthcare and the like. It *literally* exists to safeguard the population. That is their raison d'etre.

Afterwards, you'll have the pleasure of sorting out utilities. Take a note of the meter readings on the day that move in (and also try to photograph every corner of the house as part of the lease inventory), and then shop around for the best deals . You can use a market comparison website or visit each company's website in turn. The house may already have active gas/electricity/water/internet accounts, in which case you can either continue their services (after updating the personal details of the account) or transfer to a new company. Also make sure that you sort out the TV Licence fee and Council Tax reasonably soon after you move in. Your university should provide you with council tax exemption certificates after you've enrolled and these will need to be taken to your local council office. 

Decide amongst yourself how you'll pay the bills. If you trust your fellow housemates, you might designate one person as the official 'bill payer' - someone to collect the money informally before sending it off to each company, or you might want to set up standing orders and the like. Only do the former if you have absolute confidence in your friends, and only accept this responsibility yourself if you have confidence that your friends won't let you down financially.

null,null,sailorboys,null,null,null,"I'm not trying to say its bad to have an opinion about it or indeed to discuss and debate it here and there, its fun! I'll give you some background. 
* I started watching DW when it was rebooted in 2005, I was 10. I fell in love with it and grew up loving it. By the time of Tennant's departure I had gotten bored and felt as though the show had gotten stale and could do with a break. 
* I hadn't watched any of the Matt Smith/Stephen Moffat episodes until the 50th special. My God did I fall right back into loving it. I went back and watched all of the ones I had missed (took me about a year). Watching them, I couldn't believe what I had been missing. I felt like Moffat and Matt had taken the show into a golden age.
* In my renewed enthusiasm I decided to check out what the internet fan community was like on YT and reddit. I was really disappointed. Most of what I read/heard was anger about elements of the show people didn't like, frustration with plot threads and I was astounded to see people genuinely saying they '*hated*' Moffat, and that 'he was rubbish at creating characters.
* The thing which really got me was the tone, people speaking about DW the way people speak about Star Wars re: George Lucas. Namely, people speak with a sense of ownership/entitlement and they speak with disdain for the people who actually pout their heart and soul into the creation of the show. And (I know this sounds mean but) most of the voices I have heard have been American.
* That is what, in my rambling offbeat way, I was trying to get at. I think perhaps that we fans don't quite understand that DW is made for the non-whovian. And for an American,I feel as though they might miss the sense of DW as belonging to the cultural fabric of Britian which would partly explain their vexation with the way the show is made.

null,null,tenancyfauxpas,null,null,null,"&gt; What kind of alternate arrangements could be made to very professional cleaning equipment up four flights of narrow stairs?

I'd guess the same arrangements that the landlord made (assuming they didn't fix the lift). There has to be a way to get the machinery upstairs, it probably simply involves them bringing along an additional cleaner (to help carry). The carpets in the building I live in have been professionally cleaned and we do not have a lift and we have 4 flights of narrow stairs too.

&gt; Don't you think the landlord and other residents should've got the lift repaired sooner?

Yes but that doesn't have any bearing on the issue. The point is you contractually agreed to clean the carpets, and they weren't cleaned. That's on you. What would have happened if the landlord couldn't have got them cleaned at short notice (the day they found them uncleaned was days before the new tenant was due to arrive, correct?) for the incoming tenants? They'd have been significantly inconvenienced. I completely agree that you'd never have thought about the elevator issue (I wouldn't have) but it's still your responsibility to make sure the carpets were cleaned.

&gt; Are you saying that the arbitration could increase the deductions from what they proposed?

I've never been through the arbitration process with mydeposits so I can't say for sure, but it's absolutely possible, yes. ",null,0,null,1438964005,null,null,false,0,ctux0f2,null,t3_3g4ora,null,null,null,t1_ctuw9xm,null,null,null,1440340205,null,2,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

Remember mental health conditions are really common among students, so while it's all new and scary to you, they deal with people who have your problems (or very similar problems, at least) every day, and they know what they're doing. And they are people who have chosen to do a job helping people - they're not going to judge you, or be unkind, or think you're lying. They'll know you're telling the truth the same way they would know if you were lying, and they'll be ready to give you the benefit of the doubt.

It's basically just a structured conversation, and they will probably need to take some notes while you're talking, just so they can write everything up properly later. If you want to see a copy of the needs assessment before it gets sent anywhere, you can do that, or you can just let them send it if you're comfortable that the assessor understands your needs. Normally I ask to see everything, but I was at ease with my assessor so I let her just send it (the upside of this is your request can be processed faster) and that turned out very well.

I have both physical and mental health needs, so my assessment was a little more complicated than I expect yours will be, but basically after a bit of a chat about you, and how you're getting on, and what you're struggling to do, the assessor will suggest some things that might help, and you can say yes or no to each option. I got software to help me read and write, a printer, printing allowance, book allowance, physical equipment, and more time booked with a support worker than I could possibly use up in a year! I would also probably have had a notetaker, but a friend of mine on my course already had one she was happy to share with me.

If you have any other questions I am happy to help! And congrats on asking for help, I know that can be hard.

There just aren't enough actors, authors, musicians significant enough to populate a daily talk show without repeating the rotation a few times a year. The only UK talk show to run five nights a week was *The Jack Docherty Show* on Channel 5, but as time went on the host requested the episodes be reduced until it ended as a weekly show and suffered burn-out.

Daily research-based satire shows require massive staff as well as a full-time dedicated crew, which means you're responsible for the salaries of 200 people, many in skilled technical roles which don't come cheap. British satire has never had that much budget or the staff do to that.

Then there is the issue of scheduling: where would such a show go? UK audiences go to bed hours before US audiences. A significant amount of people are still watching *The Late Late Show with James Corden* at 0130 each night. British audiences drop off drastically following the 10pm news, however.

They then ran insufficient budget deficits in the intervening years, which slowed the deleveraging cycle.  This basically led to debt deflation over the last two decades, from which they're now emerging.

At 5% it goes up to £1011 repayment and £712 interest only.

Originally the dates fell so that I would pay a full months rent and move out a week into that period, the new tenant would move in and I would be reimbursed what I paid - this was a verbal agreement with the estate agent.

However, what ended up happening is that I moved out +2 days into a rental period.

To give you an idea of the last one, since we bought our house 5 years ago we've had to spend £3,000 on double glazing because most of the units went and it was old glazing with external beading, £800 on double french doors because the sliding ones warped, £200 on replacing the electric shower, £250 on replacing a ceiling after a leak from a small flat roof. The toilet cistern stopped working because the diaphragm split but I repaired that myself however it would've been another £100 if we'd had to get a plumber out. We spend £250 a year on a maintenance plan/annual safety check for the boiler after spending £300 one year on repairs. Bathroom flooring needs doing because they used ordinary laminate and it has finally warped and the kitchen is going to need replacing soon so between the both of them there's another £5-10k in the next couple of years. Not one single one of these things came up in the survey but appeared after a few years of being here. Could be worse.

Doneil Henry needs to go on loan as well to really see if hes capable of playing on a weekly basis. He looked shakey last night and his positioning as a CB wasn't great but he had some decent moments like looking comfortable when the ball was played back to him and having a few well times challenges. 

I don't mind having Jarvis around for a player to bring on last 20 mins or so to give tired fullbacks a run around. 

First time seeing Lanzini last night and he looked pretty good on the ball. Looked to have that creative spark in him, but I'm not sure about his defending. 

I always liked Zarate and he's done well in the games I've seen him play, I looks like he'll be given a chance this year under Bilic.",null,0,null,1438965325,null,null,false,0,ctuxwx8,null,t3_3g24i9,null,null,null,t3_3g24i9,null,null,null,1440340631,null,1,null,Hammers,t5_2sco3,1,null

null,null,seamushoo4,lfc68,,null,"positionally here's how i look at this: 

**bolded lines means this upcoming season represents that the position has the strongest player of last 4 years, in my humble but maybe wrong opinion...love feedback**

**gk - migs on 2nd half of last season form is the best goalkeeper we'd have had out of the previous 3 and this season** 

**rb - clyne is definitely the strongest, and most in form, rb  that will have started for us**

**rcb - skrtel, currently is the best rcb to have started over last few years, and considering he was fighting with himself, yeah he is.** 

**lcb - if sahko starts, he is the best cb we've had period in 4 years. if lovren starts, im not sure because he could play very well now that he's had some time to settle and relax. i would prefer sahko over lovren, but i know fitness has been an issue for sahko. im hoping that's what BR is trying to accomplish with him. Also, kinda have a hunch that BR is going to utilize sahko heavily in europa league because he is a cultured CB, so i see lovren starting here. If that's the case, agger of 2012-2013 was our best**

**dcm -- lucas, if he starts, is really competing with himself here. His form last year when he played was great. if he hits the ground running then I can see him being in the best form of his last 4 years, making him the best dcm of the last 4 years. I think last year he was exposed by gerrard's lack of mobility and BR's inability to tinker the formation early enough to get the most out of him. expecting a very lucas-solid season**

**cm -- Hendo...best form of his life, captain, and burgeoning star. hands down best player in that position of last 4 opening matches**

Irrelevant. The two are completely different things.

&gt;  a new tenant could move in and any rent I had contributed towards that rental period would be reimbursed.

If it went to court that would not be taken into account.

&gt; this was a verbal agreement with the estate agent.

Depends on what your actual landlord agrees to but unless its in your tenancy agreement, you're not entitled to a refund. 

&gt; However, what ended up happening is that I moved out +2 days into a rental period. 

The landlord is entitled to an entire period regardless of the fact they move someone in or not. If they decide to let you off it is not because of a legal obligation to but because of goodwill which is possibly likely to be with drawn if you're going to be a twat with them over £50.

null,null,ainsley27,tardis,TARDIS,null,"I think that right now, in a way, you're asking something akin to ""Why did all of Harry Potter happen in England, and there's nothing anywhere else in the world?""  And you know what - it sounds like Rowling (and the rest of the Potter owners) heard that, which is why Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is not going to be primarily in England.  But I think the core of both stories - Doctor Who and Harry Potter - is that they are primarily a piece of British culture that have been shared with the world.  And non-British enthusiasts are being thrown bones on occasion - there are a number of Who episodes in the US, particularly in the Matt Smith era, and Fantastic Beasts for HP fans is outside of the UK.  But the creators of each of these franchises are British and just care first about their primary audiences.

Regardless of if there are more non-UK fans than UK fans (entirely possible) of Doctor Who, its primary goal is to entertain UK fans, and anything beyond that is just gravy.  If the UK fanbase disappears, the BBC will stop running the show, which means no more Doctor Who.

There's another factor, too, and bear with me on this one: In another way (but in a way that's harder to draw a comparison, I totally admit), the flipside would be ""Why doesn't Stephen King ever write novels in other countries?"" or ""Why hasn't Robert Kirkman (or even the show writers) done a spinoff of The Walking Dead in another country?""  Also multi-country phenomenons, but very America-centric.  It's an authorial choice, and it's just so much easier to write for the culture you're part of.

**TL;DR**: If the UK fanbase disappears, BBC doesn't fund it, and no more Doctor Who.  Also, it's a lot easier to write for the culture you're embedded in than a culture 2,000 miles away that you may only understand through movies.",null,0,null,1438966088,null,null,false,0,ctuyfxa,null,t3_3g3lpi,null,null,null,t1_ctuxd1l,null,null,null,1440340936,null,4,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4,null

For me, even more than the winger, it's the proven striker that I can't believe.  I think they may consider Lanzini to be something of a Downing replacement, which, okay for me.

The sense I'm getting is that Bilic doesn't expect to play 2 strikers all the time.  He sees 4 senior strikers - Sakho, Valencia, Carroll, and Maiga - on the books already, all with generous wages at this point.  Zarate too, if you consider him to be a striker.

Valencia's injury spurred him to agree we need someone else short-term, so now the Jiminez deal happens.

We all know at this point that Maiga is not a real option.  Carroll is amazing but can't be relied upon, unfortunately.  Sakho is bound to get injured or booked or lose form at some points.  So I hope they rethink...

null,null,Woodentop_renegade,UnionFlag,Honda fireblade,null,"Woodentop's top petrol station tips. 

1) Look for the pump with the least diesel spilt round it. It doesn't matter about drivers side or passenger side just which one has the least slippy stuff under foot. Usually if its a petrol station you use often you'll know which ones are better. Some petrol stations are better than others for this. It just avoids any mishaps. 

2) Fill the bike whilst bike is upright. Either on centre stand or with you straddling it. 

3) Opening the fuel tank. Your fuel tank has to be gas/air tight. This is because the fuel tank is not inherently shaded, it can be in the sun all day. Petrol being volatile would evaporate off quickly. The way they get round that is to use a rubber seal which is sprung into position. Its on the cap (where you put the key) as such the cap is spring loaded and the locking mechanism is pushed up against the inside lip of the tank. That is the reason you feel resistance when you turn the key. Its putting wear on the key, the locking mechanism and the bolt that keeps the cap locked. Keys can snap. To reduce the resistance and extend the life of the working parts and not end up in the situation where you can't get fuel and may be some distance from home, Push down on the fuel cap. You'll feel it move a bit, then turn the key, you'll notice how much less resistance there is on the key. Not a bad idea to use a bit of 3 in 1 oil on the keyway and bot every so often. Disregard if you have a triumph Bonneville because its a screw on screw off affair. 

4) Remove petrol hose and fill. I start off by putting the nozzle a bit further into the tank so I don't accidentally over fill and end up with it dripping onto a hot engine (not a fun scenario, seen it happen).  I generally don't pull the handle all the way, otherwise the petrol tends to come out with a lot of force and the bottom of the tank is right in front of it so it splashes everywhere, just half pull the handle, won't take you any longer to fill it than a car tank anyway. Once its about half full I just pull the nozzle out so its just under the lip into the tank. I tend to not fill anymore than about 10mm from the top (allows for vapours to expand) if you overfill then then quite often as the petrol warms its will end up on the floor anyway when your bikes spits it out of a pressure release valve, down a hose and onto the floor. 

5) To close the cap do the reverse of point 3. PUsh the cap down and the key will most likely turn itself, if not just give it a gentle turn. 

6) pay, ride off. ",null,0,null,1438967216,null,null,false,0,ctuz8e3,null,t3_3g00vw,null,null,null,t3_3g00vw,null,null,null,1440341443,null,2,null,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2,null

null,null,skunkd,,Belfast,null,"&gt;I did not state that nationalism was stoked up by big bad unionist businessmen.

You said:

&gt;Indeed the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland explicitly changed their tactics of repression against Sinn Féin in response to the Belfast strikes in 1919 to encourage this nationalist narrative to stop something more alarming to the ruling class growing in ulster.

And went on to ask 

&gt;Which do you think the ruling class would worry more about? A nationalist uprising that doesn't affect their industry in the north or a labour uprising that takes their shipyards and has the ability to spread like wildfire through their country like Russia or Germany or Hungary had gone through?

Seems pretty clear to me what you were implying happened.

&gt;It wasn't that simple. That said it was something many encouraged.

If it's 'not that simple' then why do you base your argument for the behaviour of 'the ruling class' - as you describe them - on it? You've made the same case - unionist leaders allegedly stoking up sectarian tensions - exclusively time and again in this sub regarding this period.

&gt;The Belfast papers liked to link the labour movement to nationalism as part of their attacks on them.

Media's fault again is it? Too quick to blame everyone but the 'socialist' nat leaders themselves.

&gt;I don't think you realise but sinn fein was constantly trying to keep a lid on workers and farm labourers from taking land from big landowners.

I don't think you realise they didn't do a very good job of it. In fact the 'land reform' from Dublin after independence redistributed a lot of southern Protestant owned land, and a lot of that to FF party supporters raising familiar questions of the state again. Which leads us to this lie:

&gt;Because the standard court system was ineffective as a result of boycotting the landowners had nowhere to go but the SF courts who more likely than not sided with the landowners.

Threats of violence made by the IRA to use their court system or face the consequences was the standard tactic for 'convincing' people the official government was not to be used. Unless you discount occupation of homes as normal policing procedure.

What position is that then? You've spent beyond your means and burned through credit cards like your surname is Brown? Noone is born with debt.

Seriously, what you *utterly fail to understand* is that if RBS had gone under, it wouldn't have hurt the rich. Not really. You're saying ""let the rich burn and rebuild"". But it's not the rich who would have had problems.

Yeah, a few millionaires would have lost some big sums - but people with that much money tend to have complex finances. They'd have had other accounts with other banks. They're going to lose big sums, but they're not going to go hungry, be evicted or default on their mortgages. They'll get by. They might just have to defer buying that new Porsche till next month.

The people who would have suffered are the little guys - the people who's current account never goes above £1k even on payday. People who have scrimped and scraped to afford a car and are now going to miss payments through no fault of their own. Them, and people's who's employer had their corporate account with RBS, who would have learned that the company's payroll didn't exist any more and they'd be missing rent installments because of it.

Those are the people who would have been utterly awash. Regular Joes.

&gt; If your card had stopped working that serves you right for being stupid enough to play the game with sincerity. You chose to participate in this racket, you put your trust and confidence into private banks whose primary purpose is not to look after your money but to make a profit, then what sympathy can I offer you? Your choice. 

What? Playing what game? Participating in what racket? What drugs are you on, because they're bloody good. Are you saying we should all exist in a cash economy and keep our money under our mattresses? This is 2015. Most people don't have a choice but to have a bank account. Landlords want paying by BACS, not cash. Employers are disinclined to keep their payroll on the premises in cash to hand out every Friday. I don't choose to particpate in any racket.

It's very much an empty threat however as although Westminster is very much able to do so, the political fallout would make it unwise. 

Unfortunately the local politicians also know this, which is why they continually wait until something builds into a crisis, then hold a big summit and get the British and Irish governments involved to give them more money/power to 'solve' the problem (until the next self-inflicted crisis).

I think what's different this time is that the current Conservative government doesn't seem that eager to just give Northern Ireland politicians what they want hence the stalemate.

Being from Texas, we're not a swing state. We've gone Republican in every presidential election since 1976. Therefore, we don't get many campaign stops, except a rare few during the primary season.

The Electoral College is a weighted voting system. It usually goes with the popular vote, except in [very rare unfortunate exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2000).

The Electoral College is a more democratic method of selecting a country's leader than a Westminster system, but it results in selecting less effective leaders. A Westminster system lets the leaders chose the most power leader from amongst themselves.

How long do you think capitalism could keep functioning if 1/3 of the British population is made homeless due to the banks crisis? Do you think that's a viable model? I don't. 

What it means is the banks can just use those people as leverage to get the government to hand over vast amounts of money to them whenever they get into trouble. If it's too big to fail, and the social consequences of their failure too great to be countenanced, then they're too big to exist.

* Dont do an intensive driving course. The pass rate is far below that of normal lessons. You get very little time to absorb anything you've learned and its unlikely you will experience enough situations, especially considering he will be commuting for 2 hours a day.

* Find a driving instructor through local recommendations. Tell him you want to pass quickly but dont want intensive. My instructor booked my lessons then text me if he had cancellations that i could fill in. providing you have the cash for this as you can sink a decent amount of money very quickly.

* 2 hour lessons. It seems expensive but you will spend 10-15mins chatting, 10mins getting to where you are going and 10mins back leaving you with very little time of actual driving in 1 hour lessons

* Book your theory asap. It will take quite a while for a slot to come up. you CANNOT book a practical without a valid theory test.

* Maybe don't book your practical asap however ask the instructor about the practical test text service. It was £20? to sign up for. It will text you if a practical test is cancelled and a slot comes up that you can take and is on a first come first serve basis.

**Excited**: The real football starts tomorrow. Everybody is waiting for tomorrow. 
 
**Costa**: I have Remy and Falcao. Obviously Costa is such an important player for us. His mentality will be missed. But I dont want to speak about injured player. I think he will train with the team today. 

Of course i prefer a player who is never injured. But there is nobody to blame. That is very important. I completely trust in medical department. I prefer top players like him. When he is ready he makes a real differentce. 


**Stones**: I am just speaking in general. If i could I would speak with media once a month. But there are people who wants to have a press conference every day.

**More Signing**: We need a left back. I know that, board knows that. There is not just one good left back in the world. There are many.

**Bad Pre-season**: I like to win even in friendly matches. There is no point saying it doesnot matter. It is not the most important thing but some of these matches we didnot even try to win. The fact that we only have one match per week for four weeks has negative effects. 

**15-16 Season**: I believe the teams that are not title contentders are stronger. They are going to win more points and the gap between the top and others will be shorter. I have the feeling that less points is enough to win the title. You can have a good season with other teams being ahead of you. Bad season is you are 15 points behind leader. Good season is when you progress in the cup and compete at highest level in PL


**Hazard**: I am concertned he is targeted every week. But this is the situation. I think in England.. the physiciality, mentatlity is different. Lets hope everything goes well.

**Fabregas**: My no.10 is Oscar. Apart of it Willian and Fabregas can play there. But Fabregas is not a pure 10. He plays there but he is a midfield player.

Schneiderlin. Absolute beast in the midfield and has Premier League experience unlike Depay and Darmian.

Will he be starting?

Chadli showed he was capable against Milan. I would like to see Onomah in the subs later down the road.

Thrilled! With their De Gea debacle, Bastian/Rojo unfitness, and us coming off a big preseason tuneup, this is a great matchup.

null,null,satellite51,null,null,null,"You have BBC America, I think it's different for BBC One for which the show was made for. BBC One is a channel every one in the UK has. I think they have a point when they said that Dr Who is target to the average British family. It's been a while since I've lived in the UK but the BBC is one of  those British institutions (kinda makes me think of the NHS) that are so present in the UK traditions and legacy, that it sort of justifies the idea that Dr Who is made for the British audience and is part of a legacy. For this show, hardcore fans  are not the targeted audience. Writing a show for hardcore fans can rarely be done on national television because it is so excluding. They have to do it for the whole audience, and that's mainly the average British family. It's the same way in the US: your big tv shows that have huge international fandom and general audience are hardly written with other countries' input.  They are made for American audience, we just happen to enjoy them overseas. And even those big shows can't afford to pander all the time to the specific hardcore (American or Else) fans opinions. 

That being said, isn't BBC America now partly funding the show? I don't think BBC America is supported by British TV license payers, and if that is the case, then I do think adapting for that other audience is fair (but then again not hardcore fans), and I think they have done so (""Stetsons are cool"" and all that stuff). Those 2.6 million Americans are not all hardcore fans. I think a lot was done to try to make the show more relatable for the US general audience, but that's the extent of it.

Us other Europeans represent a tiny portion of the audience. I think the only countries which have it premiered around the same time as the UK are countries which receive the actual BBC, but it's so marginal and so irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. 

No one is saying your opinion doesn't matter for discussion's sake. I think they're just trying to be realistic and explain why things are not the way you (and other fans) would  like it to be. Their point was mainly about responding to a general complaint that the show is ""too British"" (oversimplifying here). Besides, fans opinion about such details is so diverse, trying to please them all is impossible. At the end of the day, I do think they do try to please the fans in more subtle ways, in ways that it does not make it hard for the main audience to get into it.

For a generic to be marketed in the EU the manufacturers must demonstrate non-inferiority to the proprietary before they are given a marketing authorisation/product license as required by law. Therefore the pharmacist is, on the balance of evidence, correct - however all health professionals must be aware that every patient is different  and you might be right in that the brand is the only version that works for yourself. Even if this a majorly placebo thing (not getting branded drug -&gt; greater anxiety -&gt; increased HCl secretion by proton pumps), this would not preclude you from being prescribed the brand as the placebo effect is just as valid medicinally as a pharmacological one. 

It is worth pointing out, however, that sometimes the generics companies cheat and use dodgy centres to conduct their non-inferiority studies - the MHRA take this very seriously, as do the EMA, and as you can see [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mhra-enforces-european-commission-decision-to-suspend-medicines-for-which-authorisation-based-on-clinical-studies-conducted-at-gvk-biosciences).

I work in the pharma industry and I can tell you there are vastly different standards between some companies (GSK and Lilly I know hold there products to a very high standard) and others (mostly generics who have very slim profit margins). 

A generic company is far more likely to take the shortest, quickest route to product - as that is where the money is. A research based company is going to go quality so they can justify the higher price point. This means there might be differences in blending powders, which could mean various reactions or physical changes do not occur (such as API coating a lactose particle) or a different compression used in tablet stamping (meaning the tablet might dissolve faster or slower).

This is before we start taking into account slight differences in excipients (non-active ingredients). A powder containing 0.5% magnesium stearate has an extremely different profile to that containing 1% but a generic might cut down on magnesium stearate as a way to cut costs (for example).",null,0,null,1438972721,null,null,false,0,ctv2yqk,null,t3_3g4fd1,null,null,null,t1_ctuw8d8,null,null,null,1440343211,null,5,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

null,null,WeaponizedKissing,null,null,null,"&gt; Are you saying that the arbitration could increase the deductions from what they proposed?

If your tenancy is monthly, and I'd be really surprised if it's not, then yes they could.

If you overrun into a new rental period then generally you need to pay for a whole new rental period. Landlords can, at their discretion, drop that down and only charge you for the time you were there, or only charge you for the time that the property is unoccupied if they have a new tenant lined up. But that is really on them. Don't forget that they could have had a new tenant lined up to move in almost immediately, and your delay in vacating could have ruined that, costing both the landlord and agents extra money in new advertising, contracts, time etc. That's all on you. If they are only charging you for the 7 days you had the property, you are getting off lucky.

I would expect that arbitration would see in your favour on the cleaning issue. Demanding professional cleaning is bullshit itself, and if you have legitimate quotes proving that you had it all ready to go at £26 ruined only by the poor lift maintenance, then I don't see how that would go against you.

But I can definitely see any arguments about rent going against you. You had access to the property for the 7th day, and then several more days as you failed to return the keys. You essentially had access to the property rent free for a number of days. You won't win that one.

Win the first dispute to the tune of £50, and then lose the second to the tune of £several hundred does not seem like a smart move.",null,0,null,1438972827,null,null,false,0,ctv31dx,null,t3_3g4ora,null,null,null,t1_ctuw9xm,null,null,null,1440343245,null,1,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

If you are taking a direct flight from UK to Iran then Dublin is the obvious place to get your visa but I wouldn't want UK people to think they *have* to go to Dublin.

&gt; And unless the tour restrictions have changed in the past 6 months then fair enough.

The sub was armed with nuclear-tipped torpedoes and its rules of engagement were that it could use them in self-defence as long as the three most senior officers agreed. The capitain and 1st officer wanted to use it, but the 2nd officer vetoed the decision.

Then there was operation Able Archer in 1983, a massive NATO training excercise that simulated a conflict escalation all the way up to a nuclear strike. As it happened during a period of high tension between the superpowers the Soviets thought that the ""training exercise"" might be a cover for preparations for a real strike and debated whether or not they should strike first, before they got destroyed. When Reagan heard about how close they came to disaster it scared the shit out of him so much he reversed his policy of confrontation and moved towards rapprochement.

 But the fun doesn't end with the cold war. In 1995 the Norwegians fired a sounding rocket that initially looked like a submarine launched Trident missile headed towards Russia. The Russian ""nuclear briefcase"" was activated and Yeltsin had ten minutes to decide whether or not to launch a strike while the rocket's trajectory was being calculated. This was, reported the closest we've ever come to nuclear annihilation.

I agree that SSM should be the law of the land across every part of the United Kingdom, but in the context of Northern Ireland, that has to work around the fragile peace established by the GFA and subsequent agreements.

As a counter-argument, SSM was legalised in England and Wales by the UK Parliament before the Scottish Parliament legalised it in Scotland. In the meantime, would it have been right for Westminster to suspend the Scottish Parliament's devolved rights and introduce legislation over a 'reserved matter'?

I suspect Northern Ireland will legalise SSM in the near-future, and the best thing we can do in the meantime isn't to tinker with Stormont's legislative autonomy, but instead to lobby MLAs and other prominent figures in Northern Ireland.

I'm not saying that Labour under Corbyn would immediately jump 10% in the polls. There'll be a long period of civil war as the left purges the Blairites and all that entails. But it will fundamentally change the nature of the political debate, as well as bring people into political activism who may never have been involved before.

But it will substantially alter the nature of the political debate in Britain. The Tories will have to justify austerity, not take it as given it's a good policy. Issues that the Tories have refused to publicly discuss, such as the overthrow of the Libyan government and it's disastrous consequences, to pick a good example, when they'd rather these things weren't discussed at all. 

I suspect that Corbyn himself wouldn't actually run for PM - he'd resigned about 12 months before the election and train up a successor (possibly Tom Watson) as well as getting some new blood on the front benches of the party to replace these discredited Blairite robots (Clive Lewis, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Paula Sheriff, a few other from the new intake, likely to get fast tracked to front-bench status.

I run an a non-profit online music &amp; culture magazine by the name of Vanguard Online (www.vanguard-online.co.uk).

The site has traditionally been run on a voluntary basis by students, though its open to everyone.

We're currently seeking writers who are going to Edinburgh Festival who'd like to submit reviews of shows they see.

No experience in writing or theatre necessary. Just a certain amount of enthusiasm for theatre/comedy etc and primary school level English.

It could lead to further opportunities to review theatre throughout the year, as we are looking to build up a network of theatre writers throughout the UK and Ireland.

If you read up on driving theory, not only will you improve your chance of passing the theory test, you'll be better in the lessons so you'll be less likely to have to do extra lessons.

When getting recommendations, ask people how many lessons they did. If they did more than 30-35 before being put in for their test, the instructor may be stinging them along a bit which isn't ideal, but it's hard to spot and can be justified with high pass rates, as my instructor had.

Don't bother with Pass plus, motorways are just safer dual carriageways with blue road signs, an extra lane or two (or four! but oh well), and none of those stupid junctions into tiny country roads, and you can always come back to it later.

I'm looking for the pricing on these parts, my intention is to move to a skylake board for ddr4 and greater sli support so I'll be selling these off to offset some of the costs. These will be up for sale within the next few weeks unless I get a solid offer before then.

---

Now looking at when they are bought new the RRPs are:

i7 4790k - [£260](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/showproduct.php?prodid=CP-539-IN&amp;groupid=701&amp;catid=6)

z97 Gene vii - [£160](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/showproduct.php?prodid=MB-615-AS)

H105 -  [£95](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/showproduct.php?prodid=HS-025-CS)

---

Obviously these are used parts (though I have the boxes etc) so I'm not arrogant enough to think RRP is correct for these. 

Would 75-80% of RRP be reasonable with a discount to maybe 70% if bought as a bundle?

You are selectively reading news of which compliment your views. Essentially reassuring any biases. It's fine to be left leaning when its the conclusion to a variety of material. However it is problematic when you are deliberately seeking left news because of left views as it leaves you unchallenged. You don't have any counter biases. Even left wing people can read the Daily Mail as it would provide them with an alternate avenue of consideration. You can, if it's too tabloid and inflammatory for you, move onto certain bloggers from the Spectator or onto more national party newspapers like The Telegraph. The point is that your current attitude to receiving news is mentally unhealthy and I think it'll be in your interest to change it.

I'm personally fine with the BBC despite its leaning. I consider, however, The Guardian to be a party newspaper which is often framing and hating so I'm a little more sceptical there. The Young Turks though:

I think that they're, in my opinion, disgustingly dishonest, insensitive, inaccurate and inflammatory. Just take a look at the first few minutes:

[The #CharlestonShooting and the Anti-Right Agenda](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01v0ItTqp_I)

This is an analysis on Cenk from The Young Turks. It is *even by* a very left wing guy. He's just a lot more rational. The channel (*Sargon of Akkad*) would be a much better source for news on your views. He does a weekly. He isn't an entirely political channel so you'd have to filter through his videos.

null,null,mightyraj,null,null,null,"Good question,

Here is the first, sent in may:


&gt; I am writing to you about the illegal trade in cannabis, and more specifically the government's worrying plan going forwards.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; You will be aware that, despite all the effort the government has put into enforcing prohibition over the past 40 or so years and recent claims of a reduction in use not withstanding, cannabis remains a very popular substance, used by millions of British people.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The massive market is serviced by an army of ""underground"" dealers. This massive industry is totally uncontrolled and unregulated. To be blunt, we have no idea who sells cannabis, what strength or potency the product they sell has, nor what contamination may be added to the product and, of course, here are no measures to to protect vulnerable people such as age limits for sales. Indeed, cannabis cannot be claimed to be a ""controlled drug"" in any plain english use of the word ""controlled"".
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; If there is any truth in the claims of harm from high potency cannabis or use by children, this is clearly a very unsatisfactory situation that has gone on for far too long.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore, will you support demands for a review of the drug laws as they apply to cannabis. with a view to ending prohibition and properly controlling and regulating the commercial trade?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; If not for the protection of vulnerable people who use cannabis (for medical or recreational use) then another serious issue we as a society face under a prohibition based system is gang violence and farming of cannabis . Criminal cannabis farms are a highly undesirable thing and it must be clear that even after many years of trying it hasn't been possible to eradicate them through enforcement. The fact is cannabis remains a very popular drug and the laws of supply and demand will always triumph and under the present laws these huge profits go to organised criminals and perhaps even terrorists.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; You will also be aware that there are a great many small scale ""hobby growers"", not connected with organised crime, who grow cannabis for their own use or, on occasion, for someone who needs it medicinally. Under the law, both these groups are regarded as the same, clearly they are not.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This is a critical time around the world for drug reform, and whilst we have seen huge steps forwards around the world in eliminating the health and social harms related to cannabis I have become increasingly worried with the direction of this government's drug policy. There is now more evidence against the effectiveness of prohibition based systems than ever, and we should always have an evidenced based legal system, not one based on racism, stereotypes and ignorance.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for reading and I hope to hear back from you soon,
 

Here is the second send in July

&gt; As I unfortunately never received a reply from my last email I sent you regarding Cannabis laws in the UK I have decided to contact you again. In light of the historic petition started this week which has already seen over 130,000 individuals calling for the production, sale and use of cannabis to be made legal I hope you will jump at this opportunity to represent your constituents who support this action.
&gt; 
&gt; As discussed in my previous email, the only reason to support the prohibition is purely ideological and a view totally devoid of the evidence and truth of what the real cost of the war on drugs is.
&gt; 
&gt; The country is clearly ready for this change, in the same week in which we have had several top ranking police officers come out and for all intents and purposes decriminalised some scale personal use. In what is it's 90th year, prohibition should be stopped.

There are people among those that know football inside and out, who know the club, who've been supporters for up to 60 years. It just takes trawling to find them. I've never used their site for news so I wouldn't know whether it's worse than it used to be. I've only ever used the forum.

I like the sub on here. The only real criticism I would have for it is that too many people do not have first hand knowledge and understanding of what the culture is. Yes it's a club from the East End of London, but unless you know the East end well or genuinely familiar with the culture and history of the club, then it's hard to relate to the club's core support. The roots run many, many generations deep. I also think there's a bit too much despair over not winning, or performing at levels beyond our capabilities. That type of supporter tends to be more recent adopters.

They're not doing that though. They're charging what it cost them to have the carpets cleaned. You agreed to have the carpets cleaned, the carpets were not cleaned because you did not get a quote suitable for the situation (required a cleaning service that could move the equipment to the premise, instead hired a service that couldn't do this) and in turn the landlord had to hire a service that could do it at a higher cost.

Your upside here is that it turns out the landlord has made up that charge, they didn't get the carpets cleaned, and the dispute resolution service decide that they can't deduct that £70 from your deposit because the charge doesn't exist. The downside potential is that the landlord makes the dispute resolution service aware of the full situation (you ""held over"") and the dispute resolution service decides that you owe the landlord 7 \* (2 \* rent) + cleaning costs.

Personally I wouldn't even be in your situation because I would have accepted fault for the carpets not being cleaned long ago, but even if I **did** want to claim the landlord is responsible for the uncleaned carpets... I would not be chancing that when there's the potential claim for a week of holding over...

null,null,michaelnoir,cnty-scotland,Scotland,null,"I've got a good book called the Middlesex County Records. It's just a list of all the crimes committed in the county of Middlesex during the reign of Queen Elizabeth the 1st, which were written down by courts at the time. 

One thing that will strike you just looking through the book and reading a few random crimes is the extraordinary violence of that time. Everyone carried a knife and if you were a gentleman you were allowed to carry a sword. Duels were common, and they seem to be excessively violent. People are always getting stabbed in the head, having their heads clubbed in, etc.

There are also quite a lot of mistreatment of children, including rapes. Here's one I opened the book at random and found: 

""23 February, 20 Elizabeth.- True Bill that, at Whitechappell on the said day Francis Skynner late of Whitechappell smith, assaulted Joan Smithe, an infant of the age of ten years, ""et ipsam Johannam tunc et ibidem.... rapuit, defloravit et carnaliter cognovit"". Et predictus Franciscus Skynner po se cul ca null sus. G.D.R.,....20 Eliz"". (the sex crimes are always written in Latin for some reason, but it means ""and the same Joan then and there abducted (""rapuit""), deflowered her (""defloravit""), and knew her carnally (""carnaliter cognovit""). 

""po se cul ca null sus"" means that he pleaded not guilty but was found guilty. 

""20 Elizabeth"" was 1578 I think. So obviously there have always been people like this.

* authorised by the worker's contract - provided the worker has been given a written copy of the relevant terms or a written explanation  of them before it is made

Luxury items aren't classified simply by whether we need them to function or not. We can live fairly well on a very simple diet yet straying from that isn't classed as a luxury. 

It's a basic product that is a major part of the diet of the majority of people in the UK. It even extends to being part of our national identity (tea for example).

Similar with meat (also didn't have that for half of my life.), I'd argue that simply because we don't need it doesn't make it a luxury item. Cheap minced meat isn't a luxury, a 16oz 21day matured steak on the other hand...

So I changed my applications to entry-level, got a job doing something a college leaver could do and then worked my way up. Myself and others in my course all ended up doing this. Nobody got that job we were promised if we did good at university.

null,null,TheLeviathong,null,null,null,"Well I'd like to agree with you, but the problem is that it wouldn't be reflective of the electoral results. It is the very parties that focus on divisive issues more that get the lion's share of the vote - in fact silly divisive things are great for mobilising the vote of those parties on either side so they have a vested interest in emphasising those divisions - hence why we see the same recycled controversies over and over.

So the situation here is that those parties cannot pass a budget, so what will we do as voters here? Not vote for different, or more moderate parties so that a budget can actually be passed and thus this country can be effectively governed - which would be the pragmatic step if everyone just wants to get on. No, we'll play the game of who done what 40 years ago, the game of fear of the other and division, and get the same results as always next year in the next Stormont election.

I really would love to agree with you - you know most people I know aren't the kind to get annoyed by that stuff so even anecdotally I'm inclined to agree with you - but election results are hard to deny. 

Northern Ireland just isn't really over the conflict in many ways. We never had a proper period of reconciliation and forgiveness after the troubles.

However, unfortunately many nationalists see the bands, and therefore the band tunes as sectarian and take great offence.

&gt;Computer science is taught at the large majority of universities – &gt;90 of 130 English higher education institutions report students &gt;studying computer science. Most other STEM subjects are &gt;concentrated in a smaller number of institutions. Institutions &gt;teaching computer science display substantial differences in the &gt;proportion of their graduates who appear to be unemployed (see &gt;the Unistats course assistant to view the employment and &gt;accreditation data for computer science courses).

Take the top 30 or so universities and I think you'll find it probably performs very comparably with the other STEM subjects. 

There's also a large disparity between groups of people aspiring to be computer programmers. [It essentially boils down to two groups - one that can program and another than cannot.](http://blog.codinghorror.com/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats/) . 

It's quite plausible that some people from the none programmer camp will have managed to get through with good grades through wise selection of modules but would have no actual chance of passing any programming test needed to get a job.

null,null,ThePoeticMotion,null,null,null,"Text for those without subscription:

Inside the visiting team’s dressing room, a disconsolate Emre Can held his hands up; his performance had not been good enough. As an act of mercy as much as out of absolute necessity, Brendan Rodgers withdrew the German in a desperate attempt to save him and his team from further punishment. Others held their heads in their hands, wondering if plans to take Steven Gerrard on a valedictory post-season trip to Dubai would have to be abandoned.

As well as withdrawing Can, Rodgers had made another decision. The helicopter that had been booked to take him to London after the final whistle had to be cancelled. Although his son, Anton, was due to play for Swindon Town in the League One play-off final at Wembley, the Liverpool manager knew that he could not attend. This was not the day for Colin Pascoe, his assistant, to take on press duties. Things were just too bad.
In the away end, shell-shocked supporters argued among themselves. Some fought with one another on the concourse underneath the Marstons Pedigree Stand as anger boiled over. This, at half-time in their final Barclays Premier League fixture of the 2014-15 season, was what Liverpool had been reduced to. Trailing 5-0 to Stoke City with another 45 minutes to come, the shock waves were being felt throughout the club.

A summer of change ensued, only for the fixture list to provide Liverpool with a return tomorrow to the scene of their capitulation by six goals to one. Stoke at the Britannia Stadium has long since been one of their most testing fixtures, but tomorrow it will take on even greater significance — it will provide the first meaningful indication of how far Liverpool have come since their most humbling, most shocking result of modern times.
“When the fixture came out I thought we couldn’t have had a better one. I’m really looking forward to it,” Rodgers said yesterday. Encouraged by Dr Steve Peters, Liverpool’s in-house psychiatrist, to “close the door” on last season in order to put it behind him, Rodgers, perhaps driven by a cathartic desire, revisited his “worst day by a long way,” taking “total responsibility for it” and insisting that Stoke will be confronted by “a different, better” Liverpool tomorrow.

In personnel terms, that is unquestionably true. Of the starting XI who faced Stoke on May 24, as few as six are expected to be named in Rodgers’s team. Change has been vast in the intervening 77 days, with an overhaul of the club’s coaching staff at the manager’s request being supplemented by seven new signings, four of whom — Christian Benteke, Nathaniel Clyne, James Milner and Joe Gomez — are expected to start tomorrow. As Rodgers acknowledges, the support he has received from Liverpool’s owners, Fenway Sports Group, cannot be questioned, particularly after such a disappointing season that left him at their mercy.

“The club has given me incredible backing in my time here. There have been a lot of changes on and off the field,” he said. “You can never take your position here for granted, and you certainly can never be complacent. The owners have given me great trust since I have been in here and, in the main, I have had a great response from the players. At the end of that game, it closed off what was a disappointing season. “I suppose it is about how you judge, really. If you look at my second season here, we nearly win the league. If you judge me on that, maybe I deserve a bit more time. If you judge me on budget, we are in the top five, and we finished sixth and we end up disappointed,” he said.
“Maybe it might be different. But the owners have put big trust in me from the first day that I came in here. I have confidence in how I work. It certainly didn’t take away from my beliefs, but it sharpened that I needed to refocus and how we could take the club forward.”
The idea that Liverpool’s previous visit to Stoke was a watershed moment that triggered a revolution might be convenient but it is not accurate.

The reality is that change was already under way. Mike Marsh, the coach, was concerned that his contract would not be renewed, a fear that was not misplaced, while moves for Milner, Benteke, Clyne and Danny Ings were in the pipeline.

Rodgers was as aware as anyone else of the problems that needed to be addressed. “The challenge for me is building a side which can get through the rough waters,” he had said after a defeat by Hull City the previous month.

What happened during “a surreal experience” at Stoke merely confirmed what Rodgers already knew. “The identity of what you stand for, in terms of organisation and commitment and fight — forget quality, forget talent as that is irrelevant— you have got to be able to fight and you have to be hard to beat. You have to do the basics well. All those elements of football, we failed in,” he said.

The immediate challenge facing Rodgers, particularly after £80 million was invested in players, is twofold: to bring about the improvement necessary to achieve Liverpool’s ambition of qualifying for the Champions League and to earn back the trust of those supporters who believe he should have been replaced at the end of last season.

For that quest to begin at Stoke gives Rodgers and Liverpool the chance to exorcise their demons but, equally, it raises the possibility that they could be consumed by them once more. Quite simply, being ruled at the Britannia once more is not an option.",null,0,null,1438985303,null,null,false,0,ctvb3r4,null,t3_3g6i66,null,null,null,t3_3g6i66,null,null,null,1440347191,null,48,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,48,null

There's so many plant-based alternative milks out there. It's really easy to switch.

Edit: To summarise if you'd rather not watch it. Cows, just like humans (all mammals really) **only** produce milk after giving birth. To produce milk, farmers must artificially inseminate their cows, then when the calf is born, it's taken away from its mother so that it doesn't drink the milk that's taken for us. As you can imagine this is very distressing, mother cows are known to [cry for hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWM5jYORSDg) after their baby is taken away. 

If it's a male it will be most likely turned into veal, if it's female it's will become a milking cow like it's mother. This cycle continues until the dairy cow reaches around 5 years of age (a cows natural lifespan is 20), when their milk production begins to decline, the cow is then sent for slaughter. 

Cows have been bred to be bigger produce more milk than naturally would, this has nasty effects on their bodies:

&gt;Levels of lameness and associated lesions have recently been investigated at the University of Reading using DAISY records (Kossaibati, Esslemont and Watson, 1999). The cost of lameness has been calculated using updated figures, with advice from leading cattle veterinary surgeons. The DAISY survey has shown that in a typical 100-cow herd the average annual incidence of lameness is around 38.2 limb-cases, affecting 26 cows in the herd 9. The estimated total cost of lameness in such a dairy herd is £4000 per year (or about 0.7 p/litre).

&gt;Modern research has indicated that lameness in dairy cattle is worse than it was some 40 years ago, and this may be due to many changes within the dairy industry such as herd size, breeding, yield per cow, nutrition, housing and management (FAWC, 1997). 

[Source](https://www.reading.ac.uk/AcaDepts/aa/DAISY/DAISY1/Lamenesscost.htm)

They are also prone to mastitis (udder infections) closely related to the production system and environment that the cows are kept in:

&gt; The results of the survey led to the conclusion that the incidence of clinical mastitis in dairy herds in England and Wales was somewhere between 47 and 65 cases per 100 cows/year; higher than previously thought. Environmental pathogens (pathogens predominating in the environment) tended to predominate but contagious pathogens (pathogens spreading from cow to cow) remained an important issue in some herds; a clear shift away from the UK situation 50 years ago, as illustrated in Figure 2.

**Fabio Borini has been given a chance to stay in the Barclays Premier League after West Ham United made an inquiry as the striker edged closer to leaving Liverpool for Fiorentina.**

**The Italian club believed that they were close to an agreement but fear that West Ham and Lazio are trying to hijack the proposed deal. Borini’s move to Queens Park Rangers collapsed a year ago and he has since struggled to make an impact at Anfield.**

West Ham are expected to sign Raúl Jiménez on loan from Atletico Madrid for a fee of about £1.4 million after the Mexico striker secured a work permit. West Ham have also inquired about Leroy Fer after the QPR midfielder’s move to Sunderland collapsed when he failed a medical.

Tottenham Hotspur have stepped up their attempts to sign Timo Werner, the Stuttgart forward, and have made an offer for Álvaro Vadillo, the Real Betis winger. Lyons want the north London club to pay as much as £10.5 million for Clinton N’Jie after a second bid for the forward was rejected. Aston Villa fear that Emmanuel Adebayor has had second thoughts on a proposed loan move. Villa had agreed a deal with Spurs last week for the striker, who has passed a medical, and had hoped to seal the move this week.

Bournemouth have bid for Glenn Murray, the Crystal Palace striker.
Mohamed Salah has joined Roma on loan from Chelsea. “Roma is one of the biggest clubs in the world,” the winger said. “Everyone here is ambitious and eager to win the title.”

West Bromwich Albion hope to complete the loan signing of Serge Gnabry, the Arsenal winger.

Sunderland have signed Yann M’Vila, the midfielder, on loan from Rubin Kazan.

Benfica have agreed to sign Konstantinos Mitroglou, the Fulham striker, on loan with a view to a permanent deal.

We haven't had enough time to bed in our new signings. Not only quality but a lot of our leadership and experience left this summer.


We're coming up against a team that are used to winning, that have been together for a while and have just added a sprinkle of higher quality to their starting XI. They are great going forward and will absolutely see us as the best possible opportunity to make a statement on opening day.

Last month, I had an assessment for ESA. I fell in the waiting room and was told they weren't legally able to help me up, so I had to stay there until I could pull myself up on a chair, then use a series of chairs to lurch/crawl into the assessment room. When I asked if I could have a minute to catch my breath because I couldn't physically stand, the person conducting my assessment said ""No"". She asked all her questions in a very rapid-fire, aggressive manner, often making snide remarks and challenging my answers, and at one point practically accusing me of being drunk/drugged during the assessment (you know, because I haven't spent the past 17 years putting up with a medical condition that gives me dizzy spells, blackouts and constant pain... I've just been high. Obviously. /s).

I don't have any real mental health issues - I get a little down about my condition sometimes, but it's in no way even faintly comparable to the struggles someone with depression faces - but I couldn't help thinking how horrible that assessment would have been for someone claiming on the grounds of mental health. The assessment process is gruelling, humiliating, and - worst of all - they base their decisions solely on a set of tick-boxes, not actual medical evidence from doctors or hospital consultants. That only comes later in the process. First things first, if ""you can move an empty cardboard box with one hand"" or lift a carton of milk, you're fit for work.

Firstly milk is something that big supermarkets can sell as a loss leader, knowing that if you pop to the shop for a pint of milk you might very well pick up something else while you're there. There's intensive competition between big buyers for milk, which is a big part of the overal problem.

Secondly although, the problem is you can't just shut down a dairy farm when the market says the price has become too low to be viable, then re-start it the next year when the market adjusts. These are living creatures, they need to be kept alive regardless of the market. You can't just switch them on and off according to the whims of the market, so whilst CAP and other subsidies are at least partially responsible for this, the idea that you can resolve these kinds of problems by subject farmers to market forces is mistaken.

When I was at uni I was in a house with 7 others and the landlord was so shit and the condition was terrible. The day we moved in the old tennants still hadn't moved out and one of them was having a break down because the landlord was telling them the property wasn't clean enough. 

Turns out he was complete a hole. When we left he wanted to keep half of our £3k deposit. The types of things they tried to tell us needed cleaning were things like a single hair on a basin (I'm not exaggerating, they claimed this needed professional cleaner)

In the end we went to arbitration and lost. I asked to see their evidence and they had shown a video inventory filmed in February when we moved in in July! I had supplied pictures of the horrendous state it was in on move-in day. 

All I can say is its not worth doing it over £150 and you'll get f-ed in the by either the landlord or the incompetent arbitrators.

Edit : the deposit was protected and arbitrated by mydeposits. They suck. My biggest advice is (and most people don't realise this) is if only some of the amount is under dispute then the landlord should return all the undisputed money to you within the deadline (two weeks). So if you had a £1k deposit and they want to keep £100 but you're offering £50, they should return £900 to you regardless of the dispute. 

If they refuse to return the money you must tell the dispute resolution service that the entire deposit is under dispute because the landlord refused to return it to you. 

Otherwise the deposit scheme will only return £50 to you if you win the dispute! ",null,0,null,1438989001,null,null,1438989552,0,ctvd8k6,null,t3_3g4ora,null,null,null,t3_3g4ora,null,null,null,1440348261,null,1,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

The reality - and I think Levy realised this - is that we just don't have any money to spend until the stadium is built. Levy and Lewis want to build this club up to sell at a huge profit. To do that we had to be consistent top four finishers and have a state of the art high capacity stadium. We missed out on being top four finishers a few years back, and the straw that broke the camels back was the magnificent seven and AVB not working out. Since then there's been no real talk of achieving top four. Even if we finish fourth this year it's very unlikely we'll stay there the year after. Our situation now is to get the big earners off the wage book and start to build for the future.

Poch is the man to do that. I don't think his job will be in any danger if we finish sixth, or even seventh this year. As long as he can get young players in, keep costs down, and keep the fans happy with entertaining football, then Levy will be happy until we're in the new stadium. A year or so after that is when they'll either sell the club or look to progress into top four finishers/title challengers.

I'm really enjoying the stage we're at now. There seems to be a lack of pressure and expectation that has burdened the managers and players for so many years. It's honestly a very good time to be a Spurs fan, as long as we keep realistic expectations. And manage to squeeze a few derby wins along the way.

Both ours &amp; Frances money has been wasted these last 60 years on something that hasn't done anything. The world wouldn't be any different if we didn't have nuclear weapons. We wouldn't even need them if we left NATO but we would have to change our foreign policy to be less interventionist, which is fine, Aazadi is right we can't afford to be world police any more.

You do if they're all independent states that wish to maintain their own security forces. As I've already said, deterrents are effective when they're not used. Simply having them is how they're supposed to work. The world would be a different place without nuclear weapons. I think there would have been more skirmishes. The foreign policy right now is less interventionist than it used to be.

&gt;Russia &amp; China are not states that are near us. We have no territorial disputes with them, if we were unaligned they would have no issue with us. I think the situation for Baltic states is more difficult, that being said they're within NATO &amp; can't afford nuclear weapons either.

They don't have to be near in order to threaten or extend their power. See The Falkland Islands. You don't need two states to actually start a war, just one bellicose party and miscommunication would do it.

&gt;I think the German opinion on nuclear weapons is unlikely to change. If NATO were to be dissolved they would just go isolationist &amp; declare neutrality. They're already a very combat everse people, something we should take example from.

They're averse now for historical reasons. Doesn't mean it will always be the case especially if they were directly threatened.

But for all its flaws it is highly entertaining, particularly in person. It has also improved by leaps and bounds in the last few years... and is projecting to keep that positive trajectory. I am a firm believer in supporting local football and the LA Galaxy are my local team. I've gone to 25-30 games in the last 3 seasons and would go to more if I could afford it.

Nothing like watching 22 men chase a football around the pitch for 90 minutes. Since I make it to London maybe once a year (if I'm lucky), I will happily take MLS.

I don't really know how Loyalists tend to feel about gay marriage, whilst the DUP strongly oppose and the UUP tend to oppose, the DUP's party composition disproportionately represents members of the fundamentalist Free Presbyterian Church founded by Ian Paisley and the UUP are ideologically a Conservative party.

 Prior to the Ireland legalising gay marriage Northern Irish Protestants were actually polled to be more favourable to the idea than Catholics, but then again, there is often a stigma around homosexuality in male working class social groups, perhaps more so in Northern Ireland, but I don't think the single issue of gay marriage or the very act of perfidious Albion going over the head of the Northern Ireland assembly would drive many loyalists to conflict.",null,0,null,1438991206,null,null,false,0,ctvefz3,null,t3_3g4e7o,null,null,null,t1_ctv0amn,null,null,null,1440348829,null,3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

null,null,prolificity,null,null,null,"Council tax is a tax on each household (i.e., group of people living together) in the country. It's not a tax on individuals. The tax is charged at 100% for each household containing 2 or more non-exempt adults (i.e. not students), and 75% for each household containing only one non-exempt adult.

Each non-exempt householder is jointly and severally liable for the household's council tax. This means that the council can insist on any one householder paying the tax in full. 

Since you appear to be the only householder who is not exempt, you are personally liable for the full amount of tax chargeable to your household, which sounds like it should be 75% of the full rate. 

Finally, council tax is normally sorted out directly between the council and the tenants. Your landlord would not normally be involved in the process, in private rented accommodation. I'm not sure what your contract with Unipol says, but it's very unlikely that it makes any real difference: the tax is chargeable, and must be paid- and you're the only person liable to pay it.

It sucks, but this is why people don't normally live with students after graduation, unless they get the students to agree to split it with them.

null,null,Ewannnn,null,null,null,"&gt;You do if they're all independent states that wish to maintain their own security forces. As I've already said, deterrents are effective when they're not used. Simply having them is how they're supposed to work. The world would be a different place without nuclear weapons. I think there would have been more skirmishes. The foreign policy right now is less interventionist than it used to be.

But they're not independent states, they're within the same defensive network, an attack on one is an attack on all. You only need one nuclear state within NATO to maintain that deterrent. So as I said before, us having nuclear weapons has made no difference since America has them &amp; we've been in NATO the last 60 years.

&gt;They don't have to be near in order to threaten or extend their power. See The Falkland Islands. You don't need two states to actually start a war, just one bellicose party and miscommunication would do it.

The Falklands island dispute isn't with Russia, China or any other nuclear state. Even if it was I still don't think it's a big enough reason to warrant holding onto nuclear weapons.

&gt;They're averse now for historical reasons. Doesn't mean it will always be the case especially if they were directly threatened. Given Germany's reliance on international trade and its size I think it would be harder for it to be isolationist and declare neutrality than other smaller countries.

Threatened by whom? This is completely ridiculous, there is no one that would want to invade Germany or ever will be. Even if no one had nuclear weapons this would be the case as it's completely pointless. The time of empire building is gone forever.

That is the problem! The human mind is easily manipulated, trained to think and act a certain way, once set it becomes difficult to change one's thought patterns. This is what I mean by calibre. I don't mean somebody smart or ""educated"", I mean somebody who is grateful to come here, has respect for the people who's ancestors bones are scattered all over the isles and who wants to contribute positively, shunning those who wish to destroy. Some immigrants are like that and I welcome them with open arms, a not insignificant number are here to take advantage and nothing else. You see them as human beings, the most destructive race ever known to the earth. 

&gt;The problem isn't ""limited resources"", there's plenty to go around, the issue is distribution.

Are you sure? We are having to import a huge amount of food and water - we are not self sufficient, yet you want more people to come here? How does that work? That's just the two main basic essentials, let alone NHS, police, housing, schools etc..

&gt;First off, I too I am white and certainly do not want to see us all killed, or anyone else for that matter. Its impressive to see you have the audacity you'd expect from a bigot by calling me racist

I figured you were, the folly of assumption. There is nothing bigotted about wanting decent people living around you. There are bigot like attitudes and blatant racism coming loud and clear from some migrants though, would you disagree with that? e.g #killallwhitemen In addition, my 'fuck em all' comment comes in relation to the current mandate of allowing entry to any and all. Do you think we are getting hard working successful people or are we getting those who have failed in their own countries; criminals, thugs, undesirables in general.

&gt;in relation to the Calais situation, and would clearly like to see millions of innocent human beings massacred in a nuclear holocaust. Which one sounds racist?

Explain to me why almost all the immigrants in Calais are young men. 
Where are their families?
What's wrong with the nearest 'safe' country?
What do they intend to do when they are here?
My solution would be to assess them individually as to whether they would contribute positively or negatively.

I most certainly do not want more of the types that harass my wife and sisters by blowing kisses, making rude gestures and touching them inappropriately as I am told by them happens, almost, every time they go to the local shopping hub by non natives.

&gt;But if you would like to have today's two minute hate on those less fortunate, go ahead. I'm sure if you shout at the screen loud enough, that'll show Johnny Foreigner !
Less fortunate how? What do they do with their life choices that make them less fortunate, 

why would coming here change that? You assume, folly, that I hate foreigners - I can understand, as I said above humans are easily manipulated. The problem is not the foreigner, it is the calibre they hold themselves to. 

Think about the future we are heading to. Do some research, bypass the propaganda and come to your own conclusions based upon the real picture, not the fantasy ideal that was placed inside your head.

null,null,monoster,null,null,null,"&gt;But they're not independent states, they're within the same defensive network, an attack on one is an attack on all. You only need one nuclear state within NATO to maintain that deterrent. So as I said before, us having nuclear weapons has made no difference since America has them &amp; we've been in NATO the last 60 years.

They are independent states within that network. You do realize that the one party being relied upon may decide not to use those weapons unless they were themselves being threatened directly. This means all other members would be vulnerable to nuclear attacks except the one with them.

&gt;The Falklands island dispute isn't with Russia, China or any other nuclear state. Even if it was I still don't think it's a big enough reason to warrant holding onto nuclear weapons.

My point there was that one party having them enables that party the ability to threaten or extend their influence on other parties. Losing territory due to force is just one step that leads to larger wars.

&gt;Threatened by whom? This is completely ridiculous, there is no one that would want to invade Germany or ever will be. Even if no one had nuclear weapons this would be the case as it's completely pointless. The time of empire building is gone forever.

Global politics can change significantly in 30 years. NATO could be dissolved or some major participants may leave. The future is often difficult to predict. There are arguments which suggest that without nuclear weapons, there would have been more wars. Some would argue that empire building still continues and looking at actions of the U.S, China and Russia, they may be right.

The problem is you can't just stop milking in times of loss, the cows need to be milked twice a day otherwise it's seriously bad for their health. So you need to spend the money to extract the milk, and sell it for the best price you can. This is what's being exploited with the surplus.

null,null,iliveintexas,null,null,null,"&gt; What did you think of our general election? I would imagine that the most striking differences were how short the election campaign was (37 days) and how little money candidates are allowed to spend (a limit of £30,000 per constituency).

It's interesting to see the same principals of democracy applied differently. We (somewhat) directly elect our president, while in the UK, your MP vote is also your prime minister vote. I think the former elects a more popular leader, while the latter elects a more effective leader.

The shorter cycle works better for latter because your party's leaders are basically already chosen, whereas we have to vet the (unlucky) few who have decided to take the big step into running for president.

In watching your debates and news coverage, I was surprised how much learning I still need to do about British politics. I know the basics of how parliament operates, but am missing a lot of the details of the debate over austerity measures vs more funding for the welfare system. In some sense, you combine our presidential and gubernatorial (state governors) into one, so your Prime Minister is responsible for a lot more issues. Your relationship with the EU is something that we have no comparison for in the US. I'm very impressed that so many countries could look past their differences and histories to come together to form a European-wide organization. It's an evolution I wish we could come to in the US with our foreign policy.

The UK non-European foreign policy and foreign aid are more comparable, but I found the UK discussion to be much better reasoned. I'm glad Miliband isn't making any attempt to defend the Iraq War. Republicans have been much more quiet on accepting responsibility. We're only at [53% of our population](http://www.gallup.com/poll/161399/10th-anniversary-iraq-war-mistake.aspx) calling the war a mistake. We still have a long way to go to learn from the past and to avoid making the same mistakes again, but [there is hope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Rand_Paul#Afghanistan_and_Iraq) for the Republicans. In fairness, Democrats are more willing to admit it's a mistake because it makes Bush, Cheney, and other Republicans look bad. They've also dodged accepting responsibility (Hillary voted for the war).

The whole obsession over Ed Miliband awkwardly eating a sandwich was weird.

The biggest aspect thing I envy are:

* More reasonable campaign finance limits. Our system was bad beforehand (in 2008), but now it's completely gone to shit. The Federal Election Commission has basically given up on enforcing campaign finance laws.

* Easier access for protest parties. Unless you're a Democrat or Republican, you're not going to win national elections (with a very few exceptions).

&gt; As for the current US presidential election, I haven't really been following it so far. I think Hilary Clinton is running for the Democratic nomination and Jeb Bush and Donald Trump are running for the Republican nomination? I may be wrong on those. I've also seen a lot on Reddit about Bernie Sanders who I think might be running for a third party? Again, not really sure. For previous elections I've only really paid attention once the primary elections are over.

Hillary's the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Bernie is an Independent (no party) but is runing for the Democratic nomination (because Independents rarely win at the national level). Trump (our rich, self-financed candidate) is the front-runner for the Republican nomination, but is hinting at running as an Independent (this would take support away from the Republicans and give Democrats a sure victory). Jeb is in 2nd place for the Republicans.",null,0,null,1438997562,null,null,false,0,ctvhp43,null,t3_3g3qe1,null,null,null,t1_ctukdst,null,null,null,1440350363,null,3,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

 I'm not surprised you're upset, you went to so much effort to distort the truth it must be frustrating to have somebody call you out on it in such simple, lucid terms. 

You disgrace yourselves every time you come out with this doublethink nonsense trying to defend the decision.
