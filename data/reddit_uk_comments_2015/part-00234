Obviously if the US or a major European country did legalize drugs it would put pressure on other governments to follow suit, thus harming the drugs companies profits in other countries.

As far as I am aware, thus far, the reporting of decriminalizing drugs in Portugal in the mainstream media has been limited to Forbes and the Guardian. The Guardian has published one or two articles where one or two UK Chief Constables have called for drugs to be decriminalized or drugs laws relaxed because of the harmful effects on society that current policy has (e.g. the large scale operations of drugs gangs and crime rates).

The other crony Corporate aspect to this is private prisons and companies like G4. If there were less prisoners, G4 would make lower profits.

The Netherlands relaxed drugs policy has resulted in a decrease in crime and in the number of prisoners. So much so, that the Netherlands have announced over the last year that they are going to be CLOSING some of their prisons due to lack of demand.

Uruguay have stated they might relax their drugs laws, but in contrast they have a hardline stance on tobacco and smoking because it is beneficial for society to take a hard line on tobacco because of its harmful effects. The Uruguay government are currently being sued by Big Tobacco (Philip Morris) because their policy of putting graphic images on cigarette packs has reduced the number of smokers by 4% a year - which isn't good news for the profits of big tobacco.

But damn man, that must have taken a while to research (albeit pretty badly and misleading). Why go through the bother? This is old so no one will see it and is against Reddit's TOS so it'll get removed.

This whole thing is an attempt to ruin and misdirect the case at hand by looking at what I did in the past. 

Yes, I did run it, but it was done purely on the non-profit basis. The money didn't go to me, but to keeping the expensive server rent going. There wasn't enough there to live off even if I wanted to. Hell, the majority of the time, the money didn't even go to me or anything I could control. I was very clear and open about the optional donations to the userbase (and this is what I was calling out. Not the illegality of it, but the immorality of misleading your fanbase into earning yourself money). I didn't HAVE to refund anything. I CHOSE to refund any unused donations back to the source, since these weren't needed anymore. When the (only two) companies (FACT/BBCWW) came to the door, none of that was even mentioned!

That was a year ago now. I got a slap on the wrist and accepted it and I've moved on. Saying ""he's gotta learn, right?"" is about a year too late. But called out ""publicly by international media organisations""? Not at all. Only one site cared about any of this and they did a short but simple interview. How can you have missed that?

That ""autistic sob story""? Nothing to do with me and I've never heard of it before. Come on, we don't even have the same name! Nor do I have a sister or been in contact with the Daily Mirror. At least try!

Honestly, I don't care how much TV companies pay for that kind of thing. It was his choice to go and do this in his spare time. Hell, I don't even care that he tried to sell them. It is specifically about misleading the fanbase selfishly. I'm no more jealous of him than I am of any other professional job. He does that stuff for a living. I'm sure if I had gone down a different path, I could have been able to create something similar.

I don't care if he blocks me (I thought he already had anyway). Even though blocking doesn't stop me from viewing anything of his, I still won't care any more.

I don't advertise my course everywhere. I think I've mentioned it a few times on Twitter, but other than that, it's not been talked about. I doubt they'll care that much. Oh, sure, a little conversation may happen, but beyond that? Fuck all. And my attitude? As in pointing out people's misleadings? Yeah, that'll really concern them. Oh man I have shivers up my spine.

&gt; Since when is getting paid more to play for a bigger team a career ruining move?

He's 20 years old, going on 21 and is a crucial part of our attacking line, a player in the starting XI, do you really think he is going to be an automatic starter for whichever team he moves to (e.g. Manchester City) that isn't Macclesfield Town?

He's most definitely not going to be getting as much game time as he is now, more bench time if you ask me. It's his decision on whether he wants to get paid more to warm a seat, or get paid less and actually do something. 

Also, if you want to get into specifics....

My comment above is an analysis of current US drugs policy, with sources to the evidence cited within the blog articles. E.G. The rising heroin epidemic in major US cities due to the increase of opium production in Afghanistan over the last several years.

The Police are mainly against current drugs policy because it encourages organised drugs gangs, violence on the streets, corruption of government officials and an increase in petty crime to pay for the habits of the larger number of hard drug addicts than would otherwise be the case. Pretty similar effects to the crime spree in Chicago in the 1920's due to the introduction of Prohibition. Prohibition of alcohol gave a massive boost to the proceeds of crime - so there was a lot more crime and a lot more criminals.

Unlike a few people here, I believe that Bentaleb could eventually be developed into an all encompassing defensive midfielder - competent defensively and excellent on the ball. If/when that happens - then we can sign on these talented kids who are excellent on the ball. The problem is, Bentaleb is very young, and still a long way off from being able to cover the defensive duties in midfield by himself. We really need to sign a (preferably experienced) defensive midfielder, who can be played in the big games, where it has been painfully obvious that we've lacked defensive steel in midfield.

So sure, Rabiot would be a wonderful signing - but he's not likely to displace Eriksen and, whilst he is probably already an improvement on Mason, he doesn't really add anything defensively and that's something we've sorely missed ever since Scott and Sandro left. If we could get him for cheap - or if Levy was being Levy, and lying about our intentions to spend little in order to keep asking prices down - then I'd definitely go for it.

null,false,Ian56,null,null,null,"What makes you think that David Cameron wants to reduce crime? He says that he wants to reduce crime all the time, but actions speak much louder than words. Have any of his actual actions actually done anything to reduce any crime? 

I would say the evidence is that David Cameron does NOT want to reduce crime, despite what he says. A reduction in crime would harm the profits of some of his cronies and political donors - e.g. G4 and Big Pharma. 

G4 benefits from providing prisons for ever more prisoners (and other ""services"").

Big Pharma benefits from high crime rates. Higher crime rates mean higher stress levels for people who live in high crime areas which mean, for example, higher sales of anti depressants such as Prozac. You are also more prone to disease and general ill health if you are stressed out - more drugs sales! Alcohol companies also benefit from higher stress levels from increased sales of alcohol.

The big banks benefit from higher crime levels as more drugs money is laundered through the big banks. 

See HSBC and the fairly recent case in the US of HSBC, which got a multi billion dollar fine for openly laundering billions of drugs money cash in Mexico for decades. David Cameron made the ex-chairman of HSBC a Lord and appointed him as a trade minister, LOL! Trade Minister for what you may well ask.

etc. etc.

High crime rates also provide the excuse for the government to introduce more draconian laws and also to militarize the Police with e.g. more swat teams. Useful for when protests, e.g. against the government's ""austerity"" measures, turn into riots. Boris Johnson wanted to buy water cannons for the streets of London but this was ""swatted"" down after a public outcry. 

The government still uses ""fighting crime"" as an excuse to put more surveillance cameras on the street and to put surveillance drones in the sky, while wasting even more taxpayer money on things like GCHQ Mass Surveillance on everyone and developing facial recognition software after hyping the terrorist threat that David Cameron has himself very deliberately helped to create.

I don't think you realise what a problem this has been. The struggle is not caused by thoughts of sustainability, but a case of limiting British fishing success in favour of other EU countries. The fishing industry has suffered the same fate as the farming industry (see Common Fisheries Policy, CFP). Dutch controlled vessels still turn up in ""British waters"" with a mammoth fishing quota in comparison to a given British equivalent. It's easy for you to brush this off in passing, but communities and local industry have silently been devastated by it. 

Here is why I'd vote to leave. I think the EU's vision is to create an equal Europe, with collectively fixed economies. As a result, the EU will continue repressing the British economy using CAP, CFP and any other mechanism to suppress and cost our economy to support others.

And how did we do defensively this past season?  Of course, we can't give the lack of a proper DM *all* the blame for the fact that only four other teams in the league conceded more goals than Spurs last season, but it's pretty hard to ignore.  No team that finished below us scored more goals, so it stands to reason that avoiding a few of those concessions could have meant the difference between fifth place and a CL spot.  Admittedly, the case is likely not that simple: it could probably be argued that several of the goals we scored were scored because we had two more offensively minded CMs, and that the two factors even each other out.  To tip the balance further in our favour, I would be perfectly fine with a transfer like this if, as has been suggested elsewhere, Bentaleb put on some muscle and got a more defensive role while still being the one to steer the play from behind with his impeccable passing.

null,false,Ilioischio,null,null,null,"Ok here's the long explanation :

In a normal canopy formation dock to build a stack the low canopy is flown so that the very middle of the canopy strikes the back of the higher jumper. The higher jumper then reaches down and grabs the top skin of the low canopy and hooks his feet around the centre two lines at the front of the canopy. He is then in charge of flying the stack. The low jumper is no longer in control of the flight path at that stage. The following is a picture of the positioning I mean although the high jumper has taken their feet out of the lines and the low jumper is controlling his canopy because they're landing the stack.

http://www.bkpc.co.uk/ImageGen.ashx?image=/media/3995/278898_2271815674287_6615281_o.jpg&amp;width=1000&amp;constrain=true

If you approach the higher jumper too quickly as the low jumper in order to dock, your canopy will start to bow around them as the centre stops but the lateral edges continue on a bit. Canopies are fairly rigid when inflated so there's some room for manouveur with that where below a certain speed of approach the lateral edges will correct back in line with the centre. If you approach reeeeally fast or at a bad angle (i.e. not directly from behind) though they don't correct in time before they fold all the way around wrapping the high jumper in the canopy and / or lines. See this video for an example

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncxSnRpjWpA

Now the following is a good quality picture of the jump in the article :

http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/06/20/09/29CD3E1100000578-3132425-image-m-60_1434789444988.jpg

What has happened here is that the low jumper has either approached too quickly or at an angle or impacted the high jumper at the wrong point and their canopy has wrapped around the high jumper. See how the white fabric of the low canopy passes all the way around the lines just above the high jumper. The low jumper has probably impacted the high jumper above their head rather than at their lower back. The point of impact is narrower, the canopy is able to fold more easily around, and it wraps. In addition the white section of the canopy isn't the centre. The canopy is divided into 7 sections lengthwise. He should have struck with the black centre ()()()(x)()()() at that point. He has instead struck with a point to the left of that ()()(x)()()()() and the load isn't evenly spread. The low jumper is now facing backwards as a result.

It is possible that the reason the low jumper didn't cut away is because if he were to do so his canopy would possibly wrap around the entire body of the high jumper and as a result blocking their vision and potentially wrapping lines around vital parts of them. Personally I would have told the lower man to cut away but I can't tell if other factors were in play.

It's also important to remember that this is a pretty common occurrence in the Canopy Formation discipline and isn't considered particularly newsworthy by anyone who participates in it.

Edit : And a comment in the guardian article supports my explanation further :

""Volunteer Dianne Richardson said it seemed the parachute opened initially, but that something happened as they were manoeuvring in to a stack position.

“To be honest everybody thought they had been tangled up, but it was only afterwards that they found out that one of the guys managed to manoeuvre to safety,” she said.

“There was an audible sigh of relief on the harbour when [the organisers] put the announcement out that they were safe.”""",null,0,null,1434798497,null,0,1434801742,0,cscsyb6,null,t3_3ahn33,null,t1_cscsyb6,null,t1_cscsn3g,null,null,null,1437211800,null,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

Arsenal have been through seasons where we've been stomped by the top teams and still finish top 4. Why? Well we grab most points against lower teams. 

**Transfers**

Liverpool also need to be much much smarter in the transfer market. Liverpool need to go for players who are under the radar. For example we got Santi Cazorla for 14m and it was out of no where, he did not cost much and has done a great amount for us. Why was he so cheap ? His club malaga needed the money. Koscielny is another one that we bought for 9m. I bring this up because every player liverpool is linked with is some hyped up the kid... for example, Kovacic , Benteke, Etc. They're great players but they cost way to much. Liverpool need to be much much smarter with their money. Our highest transfer fee paid was like 16m until 2 seasons ago where we finally were in a position to spend big ( Ozil ). If Liverpool are looking for a centre back.. Bartra from Barcelona had his transfer release clause go down to 15m until the end of june because of a stepulation in his contract of how many games he played. Those are the signings you should be trying to get. Not 30m Benteke. 17m Balotelli. Arsenal who are in deep need for a striker are not trying to go for those two and they've been available to us for a while, it just shows you we dont want to spend high sums of money. 

**Manager**

You also need a manager who can keep consistency , and defend players in the public and have a relationship with them. Hate to say this, but most of you guys want a manager who had amazing tactics and what not but that's not what you need right now.  Arsenal don't have a tactically genius manager, they have a consistent , well respected one.

null,false,d4rti,eng-Surrey,Surrey,null,"&gt; TL;DR British woman's partner was out of the UK for more than two years and was denied a visa to re-enter the UK; but the article makes no mention of the Australian's existing right of entry nor the type of visa applied for.

From the other details it is 'family of a settled person' visa. https://www.gov.uk/remain-in-uk-family - It's the only option for most couples.

&gt; This was dire reporting by The Guardian.
&gt; On what basis was the partner, Matt, in the UK before leaving for over two years? Working holiday? Permanent residency?

I'm not sure why this is relevant? The fact is they currently reside as a family in Australia, and want to reside as a family in the UK. 3 members of the family are UK citizens.

&gt; But The Guardian doesn't publish that. They just attack the Home Office with anger and hate - but no facts.

The visa system for spouses of UK citizens is pretty bad.

You later say no details are published, but they do publish the facts:

&gt; The family could get around the problem by proving that they have £62,500 of cash savings, but they do not possess that kind of money. Alternatively Cassie would have to fly over to the UK, work there and prove that she could earn £18,600 a year, and then Matt could follow some time at least six months later. 

&gt; For all we know the Home Office have done the right thing here.

Why are you spending so many hours on Reddit trying to promote the interests of the likes of Goldman Sachs, drugs companies and frackers, by posting comments that are disinformation at best and pure lies at worst, for deals that will actively harm over 99% of people if these deals are passed?

EVERY HONEST commentator that has researched the subject and that is not dependent directly or indirectly for their income or career on large crony Corporations, is virulently opposed to these Corporate Power Grab deals.

This includes people from the right (e.g. Pat Buchanan, Paul Roberts, UKIP), people in the middle (e.g. the Independent) and people on the left (e.g. Geraint Davies, Caroline Lucas, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Democracy Now, Common Dreams etc. etc. etc.). 

I linked to a selection of articles at the bottom of my piece so people could see just how broad based and how strong the opposition is to these disastrous deals. ALL of the above people are saying very similar things to my article.

The primary Corporations we are talking about (the ones who will benefit the most) are:- 

Big banks

Big pharma

GMO's

Frackers and other miners

Direct or indirect income dependency includes (but is not limited to):-

Political campaign donations to politicians or political parties (bribes) from one or more of the above

Working for a media agency that derives a substantial proportion of advertising revenue from the groups above

Being paid by a lobbying firm or other agency on behalf of one of the above companies

Industry lobbying groups for one of the above and authors of reports sponsored by them

Working for a company in one of the above groups (particular execs or senior managers)

Working for a media agency whose controlling board is dependent on political largesse and comprises a major proportion of these Corporate interests, e.g. such as BBC Governor Marcus Agius, ex Chairman of Barclays Bank and married to Lady Rothschild http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9368632/Who-is-Marcus-Agius.html

The main issue I have with this is the disrespect that comes with it.

Fine, let me quote for you what I've written elsewhere;

EU Trade/Trade negotiation is kind of my area of expertise, having written one of my masters theses on the topic, studied it intensively at masters level, and continue to keep informed about it to this day. I don't write about the TTIP because I'm for the treaty, I write about the TTIP because I'm against the bad arguments people use to oppose it. Plus it's nice to put what I spent so much time and effort learning into use.

So it's not just TTIP I'm interested in, I've written about other EU-US trade issues as well [such as here](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ztbsz/the_french_train_company_sncf_has_been_told_it/cfwsy7z), and from the knowledge I acquired I also comment on matters of ISDS or international negotiation practice in /r/australia when it's relevant and the TPP comes up (kinda like an Australian-US-Pacific TTIP). I also live in Europe, so TTIP is likely to affect me more.

It really isn't because that is not how projects work in the real world. Flying to the moon does not happen in a 'big bang' at the end of a 15 year project.

Nor should students be expected to memorise specific formulae but to instead understand concepts and know how to apply them. Looking things up, knowing *how* to look things up as well as *what* to look up are all skills in themselves. Open book tests are much better for this exact reason. If you want people to understand the topic, you let them have reference material.

---

Look, here's the deal with pitbulls - they're huge, they're strong, they're pure muscle, they're bred to fight, they have a high pain threshold, and they're scary-looking. To both people and to other dogs. Are their personalities a ""tabula rasa"" in the sense that they can they be just as harmless as any other dog if raised in the right environment? Yes, probably often-to-most of the time.
There are a couple of problems with this though. One, many pit bulls are not raised in ""the right environment."" A lot of the ones who are rescued from crappy environments, sadly, have either been abused or have at least ""seen some shit"" and are broken, and are beyond rehabilitation - they are ticking time bombs. They won't necessarily attack a person or other dog at any given time, but the odds that they will attack someone at some point are definitely elevated. It's not that they haven't attacked anyone, it's that they haven't attacked anyone yet. And it only happens once - they have to get put down after the first time.
On top of all this, because they are so strong and scary and intimidating, if they DO get into a fight, the likelihood that they will injure or kill the person or animal they are fighting with, is much higher. They will stay in the fight longer, they will probably win, and it is much harder to get them to STOP fighting. I have had Jack Russells most of my life. Every once in a while they get into a fight, and sometimes it gets pretty bad, maybe one will grab the other by the scruff and there is squeaking and I have to separate them, and maybe a dog starts bleeding a bit or gets hurt from being slammed on the ground. But that's usually the worst of it. Now if one of them were fighting with a pit bull, and the pit grabbed a jack (or god forbid a child) by the scruff and started jerking him around, the little jack is fucking dead with the first snap of the jaws. That isn't a prejudice thing, it's a body mass and strength thing.
Add to this the fact that other dogs are naturally intimidated by pit bulls' size and appearance and they are more likely to interpret an ambiguous behavior as aggressive, and therefore to start a fight to defend themselves. Again, this supersedes any human ""prejudice,"" this is a phenomenon that other species can see too.
So yes, given all this, I am very wary of pit bulls. If someone I know and trust has raised a pit from 8 weeks, and I know it to be a well-trained, friendly dog, then I am unreservedly fine letting my dog play with the pit. But if someone I think is kind of irresponsible, or who adopted an adult pit from an abusive or unknown background, I don't want my dogs around it, even more so than most other breeds. It's just common sense.

As far as im concerned, school and a-levels (pre university) should be about giving you a practical grounding in a specific subject. If you have very little practical application for something you are taught and tested on then it is fundamentally useless for the majority of people. Sure, at degree level it's enough to study something for the inherent beauty of it but before then i'd argue no, it's a pointless exercise. At A-Level, most people aren't even studying subjects they particularly like, but the more prestigious subjects which land them a better chance at a university of their choice. Bloating the curriculum with theory with little practical application does more damage than good in my opinion.

It's why I drew the comparison to Arsenal really since there's a lot of similarities between us right now and Arsenal a couple years back.  I've said to my friends for years that all it takes to get top 4 is to consistently beat the lower teams.  Sure it sucks to get top 4 that way but if it's getting you consistent champions league you will eventually start to attract the bigger players you need to start challenging for titles and trophies as Arsenal has started to do.

On the transfers I agree 1000%.  We always seem to go for the player everyone is already going for which drives the price up or the next ""wonderkid"".  We need to sign more Coutinho's, Can's and players like that.  I think there is some serious issues going on behind the scenes when it comes to transfers with us.  Rodgers is getting stuck with players he never wanted sometimes and we're going for too many over priced players just because they have ""premier league experience"".  You know there's got to be an issue when it comes to transfers when Rodgers says in an interview that Balotelli will never be a Liverpool player and then we sign him right at the end of the window in what is obviously a panic buy.

  My biggest annoyance right now is that a lot of Liverpool supporters seem to think that we can instantly be right back up there in a season or two when realistically it will take at least 5 years of good management and transfers to get us to that point.  Last season was almost a bad thing(not really bad as in I wouldn't want it to happen again) in that it made a lot of fans think we are a lot closer to that point than we are.  Even last season though it was painfully obvious we didn't have the depth in our squad needed.  

That is exactly what I think we need in a manager and it's been my one problem with Rodgers.  He is such a young inexperienced manager that it was always going to be hard for him to have consistent results without hiccups throughout the season.  He shows flashes of brilliance but then his stubbornness with formations betrays him a lot of the time.  What Wenger has done with Arsenal for all the shit he has gotten from some Arsenal fans at times is amazing in my opinion.

It does.

&gt; Time the switching of the account well, wait till all your direct debits have been paid that month from your old account and then start the switching process. Everything should all be ready for the next month in the new account.

You don't need to worry about timing, but in general it takes 7 days and you can choose specifically which day to swap.

&gt; YOU WILL need to notify your employer. Take your new bank account number and sort code to HR. You will also need to notify any other company / person that DEPOSITS money into the account.

You do, but not straight away. All payments are redirected for the next three years automatically.

&gt; Before you switch, log into your account and make a list of all the direct debits, standing orders, and card payments that come out your account. Once the new account is open, go over the list and make sure all your payments are there.

Definitely good advice.

If anything messes up and that costs you money, it's the new banks responsibility to cover that cost iirc.

Respected by who exactly?

Paid for by who exactly? Large international law firms derive most of their income by representing the interests of large, often multinational, Corporations (and some comes from crooked politicians and Oligarchs).

As you quite rightly say, these are the type of crooked Corporate lawyers that will be appointed to the transnational anti-democratic arbitration panels and will pass judgements in the interests of their crooked Corporate sponsors and against the interests of ordinary people. A very lucrative career can be expected out of sitting on these panels, given the amount of money that will be at stake on a lot of the rulings. Both during their stint and the lucrative post(s) or assignments they will get after their stint (its called being paid off).

The more crooked the large Corporation and the more it infringes on the rights of ordinary people the higher it's legal fees are likely to be and the more it will hire people from a firm of ""international lawyers"".

I don't think it's an unquestionable fact that physical harm is worse than upsetting a few people, simply because there are cases where most will agree that it's justifiable to harm someone despite it upsetting others.

For example, many would agree that it's justifiable to harm e.g. ISIS members who've murdered, in spite of the fact that it will upset other ISIS members. So there's one instance where the fact ""physical harm is worse than upsetting a few people"" is either untrue, or not the best policy decision for a civil society.

It is fact that everyone is different - even identical twins have differing opinions - and therefore there will be some people who value their own happiness over the health of others (evident by the number of supporters of the current drugs policy). For those people, physical harm of others as a result of current drug policy is *not* worse than themselves and their peers being upset by seeing drugs widely available (or even, more sinisterly, their peers profiting from drugs being illegal). Although it could just be that those people aren't actually aware of the harm the current policy causes.... hmmmm..... What were we talking about again?

Don't get me wrong, I disagree with the current policy, and agree personally that physical harm is generally worse than upsetting a few people. But that's mine and your personal view. Fact is, the current policy makers obviously don't think that way, for whatever reason. They're clearly acting upon their own set of facts (such as ""I probably wont get the votes of a certain demographic if I legalise drugs"").

That's 63.1% that didn't vote for this government, assuming you ignore the 33.9% of the population that were eligible to vote but chose not to.  If they wanted their opinions known, they should have voted and it's impossible to say who they would have voted for had they bothered to do it.  But this is about supporters of austerity, not who voted for this government.

Add to that 36.9% the UKIP's 12.6% of the vote, [because UKIP did support austerity and I don't think they've come out against it since](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-31656700), and you're left with 50.4% (not 50.5% due to rounding) that did not support the Conservative's austerity measures.

The Lib Dems also supported austerity, though they claimed before the election that they would [cut £38bn less than the Conservatives, while borrowing £70b less than Labour](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/05/lib-dems-end-austerity-nick-clegg).  One could say that they support austerity in some form, but not in the form that the Conservatives are currently enacting.  They received 7.9% of the vote.  How many of those 7.9% would support the Conservative's austerity measures?  Again, it's impossible to say, but you only need a slither over 0.4% to push supporters of austerity into the majority with regards to those who voted, that's just over 5.5% of those that voted Lib Dem.

So, while the majority of the country didn't vote for the current government, to therefore say that the majority of UK voters oppose austerity isn't exactly true seeing as over 57% of voters, that is the majority of voters, voted for parties that they knew favoured austerity and 49.6% of voters voted for parties that supported the Conservative party's austerity measures.

The insurance industry has outsourcing down to an art form you wouldn't believe. By the time all the outsourcers are paid, there's probably no profit at all in your car insurance. 

So where's the money then? How come we haven't heard of them all going bust overnight?

Simple. They hide where the profit comes from, same way Ryanair hide their costs:

 - Direct debit payments. Insurers love these; the customer pays a third-party company like Premium Credit the equivalent of £20 in interest and ""arrangement fees"" to take direct debits, Premium Credit keeps £10 and gives £10 to your insurance company. Hint: Take out a credit card that's interest free for 12 months, pay for your insurance on the card and pay off the card over the 12 month period. It'll cost you less.
 - Add-ons like legal cover. A £30 legal expenses policy probably costs more like £2 for your insurer to buy; the other £28 is profit to them. Not to mention, if the customer's on Direct Debit, you can add the legal cover onto that and suddenly you're not asking the customer to pay £30 extra all at once - you're asking them to pay £3/month. Much easier sale.
 - Renewals. You don't have to pay the meerkat for a customer who renews, but you sure as hell do for the new customer who buys through their site. And the meerkat charges like a wounded rhinoceros. If you can offer a policy for within 5% of what you charged last year, chances are the customer will stay on - in which case, bump it up by 5%, hope the majority of customers stay on and to hell with them if insurance rates have actually gone down in the last 12 months!
 - Cutting costs down to the bone. There is a reason so many of them have call centres in India. This can lead to unintentionally absurd processes, and is precisely why your insurance company don't seem to be able to organise a piss up in a brewery. They can't; it'd be too expensive.

Who did Eric Holder work for before he worked for the US government? He worked for a major law firm that derived most of it's income from major crony Corporations. Goldman Sachs was a major client.

The Corporations buy the politicians that form the government. The government and the bought politicians act in the interests of the Corporations. They are on the SAME TEAM.

Okay. It's quite simple. Aged 8 I was held down and force fed bacon to send me to ""hell"". I was Hindu. I could have eaten Bacon if I chose to. I didn't because I was vegetarian. Many Hindus are for religious reasons. 

I don't rate bacon highly when I swapped to a non-vegetarian diet. I have faced racism over and over again. Both overt and unconscious. Anti-Muslim and Anti-Asian bigotry exists. 

Now you can spin this as ""Maybe they wanted to introduce you to something you don't normally eat"" but I am half khmer. If I fed you the food that Khmer Cuisine is most famous by holding you down and cramming it down your mouth you would call me a wanker for doing that.

I'm gonna need proof of that. It sounds like bullshit. Have some cited facts I found:

According to the ONS there are [791 thousand](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-31938368) people on Jobseekers Allowance.

As of February 2013 there was [3.3 million](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statistical-update-disability-living-allowance-claims) people on Disability Living Allowance.

There are also 10% of full-time workers who are earning less than [£7.28/hour](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-25759780) and that isn't even the living wage (aka the minimum you can be expected to live on) which is £7.45/hour.

There are [six million](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-25287068) people in employment who live in poverty.

&gt;However, I think anyone who gets up off their arse and does a hard days honest work deserves to not be taxed to fuck to support those who are too lazy and get a free ride.

The fact is that there are millions of people working on low pay who will never be able to afford a house and buy to let landlords are just making the problem worse. Therefore, the aforementioned landlords should be taxed to discourage it. It's essentially the same as taxing cigarettes heavily, it is an undesirable habit and the best way to get people to change their behaviour is to hit them where it hurts &amp;mdash; in the wallet.

&gt;However, I think anyone who gets up off their arse and does a hard days honest work deserves to not be taxed to fuck to support those who are too lazy and get a free ride.

How exactly is getting mortgaged out of your arse and buying up a bunch of houses and then living off the rent doing a hard days work? That's what a lot of buy to let landlords do.

I spent a few years there training computer programmers for the office my company opened there. Some of them were great, couldn't ask for better programmers. A lot of them just blew my mind with their complete lack of programming skills. There was one bloke, apparently had a first class degree in computing, and he couldn't even understand if statements, which are taught in the first lesson!

Of every batch of 20 new-starters I taught, you'd be lucky to get 3 or 4 who were up to the standard you'd expect of UK graduates. I know the reason they're emplyed is because they get something like £4-600 a month instead of the £2-3000 a month the same grade programmer gets, but you need twice as many, and waste a load of managers time and senior programmer time reviewing and re-reviewing their work to try to get it right. It's a massive headache. Out of the 170 programmers we've got in India, there are only 15 I would fight to keep, and maybe another 30 I'm happy to work with. The rest of them, I might as well just write the code for them - it would be quicker than reviewing it and sending it back for corrections 6-7 times! I'd certainly do less overtime that way.

Then again, most of the Indian HR department was fired last week because it was found they were taking bribes to employ people and shift their test scores.

null,false,86legacy,null,null,null,"I agree, the Arsenal approach is probably the best model for us to take, but hindsight is also a lot easier to fallback on then actually putting in place a plan for the future. Not to say that I don't think we should be, or that we aren't already, tacking this approach, but it shouldn't be the be-all-end-all plan. To be cliche, we need to find the ""Liverpool way,"" what ever that may come to mean--history will define it if we are successful. 

However, lets consider what positives we do have.

*Financials:*

Without a doubt FSG are taking an approach that is geared at increasing our revenue (already one of the largest in the world), building the infrastructure for future (stadium/facility expansion, wage restructuring, internal reorganization, etc), and bringing in youth to revitalize the team (which has its issues with the lack of experience in  the team, but see Milner as step in the right direction on that topic). 

So like you have mentioned:

&gt;we don't have the same amount of money as Chelsea, United, City, and Arsenal

I think we have made progress on that front. It may take time, but we are certainly moving in the correct direction. A positive sign that we are gaining ground (albeit probably a small step forward)

*Transfers:* 

I know a lot of people around here like to write off the transfer committee, and I see their reasoning, but the theory behind it is still a promising idea. The way I see it, the transfer committee is an attempt to implement consistency in the long run. A DoF can have great success, but they could also be highly inconsistent year to year. Without a doubt the transfer committee needs to be refined, but the premise and goal are still admirable, in my opinion at least. 

In terms of the actual transfers, I think we have made some mistakes (see balo), but it is still too early to right off the investments that we have made in players like Can, Markovic, Origi, Moreno, Manquillo, Lovren, Ibe, Ings, Lallana, etc...Some a clearly young players with potential, others (lallana, lovern) are still in their prime who could still be consistent and stable players for the team. Personally, I don't put much thought into any player brought in before this past year, some have been great, but most were just stop gaps to fix a team that was in a troubling state. 

Rodgers, well, time will tell if he is the future. He has shown success, and deserves one last chance to prove why we brought him here.

&gt;

&gt;__Dolwyddelan Castle__ ([Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language): *Castell Dolwyddelan*) is a Welsh [castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle) located near [Dolwyddelan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolwyddelan) in [Conwy County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conwy_county_borough) in [North Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales). It is thought to have been built in the early 13th century by [Llywelyn the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llywelyn_the_Great), Prince of Gwynedd and North Wales. Though the castle was then only one tower with two floors, a second tower was built in the late 13th century and a third floor was added to the first during the late 15th century repairs.

[Hate crimes against Muslims in Britain spike after 'jihadi' attacks, study finds](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/17/hate-crimes-against-muslims-britain-spike-jihadi-attacks-study)

['People grab our veils, call us terrorists and want us dead': What it's really like to be a Muslim woman in Britain](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-politics/10804880/Islamophobia-People-grab-our-veils-call-us-terrorists-and-want-us-dead-What-its-really-like-to-be-a-Muslim-woman-in-Britain.html)

&gt;How about showing me the police escorted match of the EDF holding up signs saying all Muslims will die and the middle east will burn in hell. 

Go go to any white supremacist website, you'll find a lot of incitement to violence against Muslims.

&gt; Show me where the right wing has taken over parts of two diffrent countries and are killing innocent people left right and centre for not believing in the same thing as they do.

Is that what all Muslims are doing, or just a small politically motivated group? What percentage of British Muslims are involved in this war? You don't know mate, stop going around making sweeping statements without the empirical evidence to back it up. 

&gt; Like I said comparing the right wing to Muslim extremists is like comparing apples to oranges.

They are two sides of the same coin -- Islamists are just more widely scrutinised and feared. 

Let me ask you something -- what do you know about the history of this conflict? How extensively have you studied the religious ideology used to justify it? Your views are lacking nuance, they are lacking context, and most importantly, they are lacking humanity. Muslims are human beings too, and the kind of views you espouse seeks to dehumanise them, which in turn makes racial / xenophobic hatred more justified. There will be more violent attacks against Muslims if views like yours are allowed to take root.

""The economics of austerity are no different in Britain from what they are in the rest of the advanced world. Harsh austerity in depressed economies isn’t necessary, and does major damage when it is imposed."" - Paul Krugman said this - he won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. He wrote about it extensively in his debates with the European Central Bank, the IMF’s chief economist, Olivier Blanchard and his take down of political scientist Henry Farrell, writing with the economist John Quiggin. He has been along with MANY other anti-austerians since 2009.

&gt; All there is is ""Austerity = bad"" 

No actually, leading nobel economists and thinkers, such as Krugman, and anyone who shares a keynesian viewpoint have been arguing this for a hundred years. It's filled thousands of column inches in hundreds of papers worldwide since 2009 and is one of the most debated subjects in economics right now. You couldn't be more wrong if you tried.

People who like to be reductionist and say shit like ""Austerity = bad"" are not only being ignorant they're actively ignoring the debate. Read a book.

&gt; Basically what I said is accurate though.

No it's not. People aren't asking for 'more money' by saying 'don't cut funding'. Can't you see how ridiculous that statement is. The arts are being CUT. It's a net positive industry. You put in £400m you get out £1.2bn. Cutting it is stupid. By NOT cutting it and keeping it the SAME what they're asking for is 'the same' not 'more'.

 Of course the Tory party have not said 'we explicitly want poor people to go to a charity and get their food', it's just that at the core of conservatism is the ideology that the state should not provide - I'm literally harking back to David Cameron's 'big society' policy. This is what he wanted - he wanted private enterprise and charities to step in and take over. This is what's happened. That was my point. 

To debate the rest of your post:

Raising the minimum tax threshold is not a good move (And FYI the policy is based on 30hrs/week, so full time workers on the minimum wage will still be paying tax). It looks like a good move, sure, but people at the lower end of society are disproportionately dependent on the services those taxes fund. A better move would have been to raise the minimum wage highly enough to bring those working full time away from any kind of working tax credit - bingo you've just saved the state a hell of a lot of money and improved the quality of life of 1.4million people (plus the knock on rises for those who were above the old minimum but are below the new, incalcuable right now). There are economic arguments for and against raises of minimum wage but there's a body of evidence that with more money available at the bottom end of society (where people tend to much more immediately spend money that comes in, rather than saving or investing) this would offset the cost to business of a higher minimum wage.

I'm a bit bored of the 'anti-business' rhetoric. Almost nobody with any sense is anti-business, but I personally am anti-inequality. People with certain skillsets and who have done well for themselves deserve to be rewarded but not at the expense of those who provide the foundation for their success. I'd quite like a 60% tax - on those who earn more than £500,000 a year. It makes no sense for someone who earns £190,000 a year to be paying the same tax on a portion of their earnings as an oligarch earning £1.9m a year.

Honestly though, I'm not sure how true that argument is, but neither is anyone else.

Same argument applies to the 2nd section on demand. Also, it depends on where the tax breaks are being offered. Sure, there's been an increase in personal allowance, but there's been (AFAIK) financially far greater cuts for the top ends. Savings for the top ends only benefit society (increase demand properly), I think, if you accept the trickle down economic model, which many economists agree isn't valid.

Surely you know that both are included in profitability calculations. They are expenses. Those are just the obvious ones.

Profit comes from two places: cutting costs and increasing profitable income. 

The aggregators are an important example because I can go onto Compare the Market right now, punch in details and get half-a-dozen near identical prices.

They're nearly identical because in many cases, the brokers are quoting the same policy from the same underwriter. The difference comes from the brokers intentionally cutting their margin slightly in the hope of appearing higher up the list - and then flogging an add-on like legal cover later on in the process.

Ten years ago, the model was simple: the broker sold the policy and took a 25% (or thereabouts) commission. That commission was his to do what he liked with, but he had to cover his own costs before he could put anything in his own pocket.

Today it's a little different - usually the broker is buying the policy at one price and is free to sell it at any price he likes. And those quotes on Compare the Market? Many of them are the exact amount that the underwriting insurer is charging - some are even slightly less. Never mind how much it costs to operate the brokerage itself!

Therefore the broker is not making money on the policy itself, therefore the broker is finding somewhere else to make the money. Those places are not immediately obvious to the customer, hence they are hidden.


&gt;&gt; They hide where the profit comes from,

I don't think expecting students of a subject to do their own work is being 'idealistic'. Others may have different views on why to care about university, but if you're paying £27'000+ and sinking 3+years of your life into something, I think there should be a better incentive than simply a job.

Luckily, this was a good ten years or so ago when police practically outnumbered the public on Weekend Nights in Stockport so a passing squad car stopped and they scooped him straight up with the canister in his hand.

I gave my victim statement and made sure to play up the impact the incident had had on me, how I didn't feel safe leaving the house, was having flashbacks etc. (In truth, although it hurt like a bastard, it didn't seem like the worst thing that could've happened to me for having the temerity to venture into stockport after dark with my family to watch a gig).

What the copper said next though has troubled me to this day: 'Don't worry he sustained *several injuries* as he *violently resisted arrest*. I don't remember if he actually winked, but he didn't have to. The lad gave up straight away and let himself get cuffed and stuffed in the car.

On the one hand. He was a vicious bastard who'd attacked me unprovoked and there was no chance of mistaken identity. On the other hand I now knew that the GMP did still engage in police brutality. I think I'd rather not have known about that.

When it came to the video line-up I had no idea. It all happened so quickly that I was blinded and incapacitated before I even knew what had happened.

Luckily the presence of the weapon, my families eye witness accounts, CCTV and the coppers catching him 30 seconds after the incident fleeing the scene was more than enough to convict.

Rural vets are far better and seem more interested in treating the animal than your wallet. Without checking with SWMBO who is in charge of all things animal in our house I think its the wormer the vet recommended we have for our dogs is actually one for horses but is infinitely cheaper and does the same job. Its a similar story with the medication for one of our dogs which is epileptic. The tablets he takes are for something else but they're £10 a month instead of £50. Animal pharma companies are very good at racking up the price several hundred percent if the animal is a ""pet"" variety.",null,0,null,1434811643,null,0,1434812061,0,cscwu9r,null,t3_3aao1c,null,t1_cscwu9r,null,t1_csb5ry1,null,null,null,1437214053,null,0,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,0,null

No, 'more money' is not the same as 'some money'. 'More money' is 'some money' and a 'some more money' on top.

Morality is malleable.

&gt; Why not just lie and cheat at your job, then?

Usually people don't do it because of the risk or because they're simply too unaccustomed to playing dirty. Of course, others aren't and they end up coasting because of that. It's the age old free-rider problem.

&gt; but it basically implies that we shouldn't even think or care about the morality of something

My point isn't that you shouldn't care about morality but rather that it can be useless to try and frame the solution by relying on it. How did the moral case for abstinence work for sex education? How did it work for political organisation? The point is simple, rather than relying on the morality and hoping that will do the work you want it to instead focus on what people do regardless of moral concerns and seek to limit those possibilities. After all, separation of powers isn't done because we put faith in morality. So why would we do that in any other case?

null,false,DRBB22,null,null,null,"&gt; his ""midfield presence"" isn't much of a presence, seeing as how he only played there because his center back play was so atrocious that he couldn't be trusted to play in defense.

And he was quite serviceable in midfield, too. His deficiencies were less amplified alongside Matic, and they looked great as a pairing. His ball winning capabilities further forward with a proper shield next to him is commendable, and it'd be disingenuous to discard that based on his ineptitude in a back 4.

&gt; his ""midfield presence"" is neither employed by his national team nor his current league winning side

Do you not remember when PSG played him in central midfield during the first leg and he played a blinder along with Verratti and Matuidi?

&gt; his ""midfield presence"", that being a defensive midfielder, was replaced by nemaja matic who is arguably the best defensive midfielder in the world and clearly the best DM in the EPL

Not really. Matic may have become first choice, but in bigger games when we needed 2 to screen the back 4, he was important, and not replaced when he left. My original post referred explicitly to his partnership with Matic before he was sold. They offered an effective screen against City, Arsenal and Liverpool; nobody filled his void when he left for PSG.

&gt; His ""midfield presence"" was actually left-bench, as the starting central midfield role you are referring to went either to Lampard or Ramires last year

That makes no sense. I clearly meant his midfield presence in bigger games, when Mourinho wanted a more solid defensive pairing ahead of the back 4 and him and Matic were his option. Tell me, in spite of Luiz's occasional brain-dead moments, who was more capable there? Him, Ramires who has looked overrun in the majority of the big games he's played as of late, or Lampard who was closer to 40 than 30 by then? Did the starting central midfield role in big games against PSG, Atletico, Arsenal, or Manchester City go to Luiz or them?

&gt; His ""midfield presence"" in terms of roster spots was replaced by Cesc Fabergas who played the other central midfield role beside Matic for most of the season

Again, I meant his ability to play alongside Matic in bigger games. Does Cesc offer that at all, especially in Europe? Hardly. 

&gt; So his ""midfield presence"" was born out of the lack of consistency at his natural position

Expect he's quite good in defensive midfield, your attempts to put him down because he struggles at centre back are pretty invalid

&gt; was occupied by two roster players ahead of him on the pecking order

By ""roster players"", I'd guess you're referring to Ramires and Lampard. They weren't ahead of him in the big game scenario I was talking about; the lineups from those games will corroborate that.


&gt; and isn't used by any of his other teams

PSG did the exact same thing in the Champions League - a big game - against us, and it worked wonders.

&gt; I don't think expecting students of a subject to do their own work is being 'idealistic'.

That's not what I was referring to as idealistic, but rather this reliance on morality.

&gt; I think there should be a better incentive than simply a job

The issue is you're ignoring the fact that other people see things *vastly* differently than you.

&gt; the player doesn't have to play the game

Sure he doesn't. And I don't have to pay taxes or breathe.

&gt; regarding the meds I mentioned; staying up all night in order to get coursework in 1 minute before the deadline is still better than cheating

Again, because you somehow rationalize it to be like that, but one could just as easily make the case for cheating. Sure, both cases would collapse under scrutiny - but that's the point. You're being just as selecting in your reasoning as the people who justify cheating.

&gt; Or what about if we did a piece on one of the professors? Could we publish an article that featured a (publicly available) picture of him and name him or must we seek permission to use those things?

You generally don't need someone's permission to write about them or to publish photographs of them.  However you generally do need the permission of the owner of a photograph's copyright to reuse that photograph.  Just because a photo is available on line doesn't mean you have the right to take it and use it in your own work.  This is widely ignored online, even by large organisations that should know better, but that doesn't make it legal.

The first batch of programmers we employed, we had 300 people applying for each of the positions. In the end, I interviewed about 100 people, but that was after HR cut through the rest with a couple of rounds of interviews and tests.

Remembering raw data and not thinking does match with some things we've noticed. We have a lot of checklists and guides for the standard code bases we use, and these are generally followed well enough. But where a project needs something a bit different, quite a few of them struggle to work out how to fix it, so I spend a lot of time writing pseudo code they can use as a basis. It's a bit of a problem, as coding is creative, and needs to be thought through and experimented with. No guide can cover every possible scenario, particularly on our more bespoke systems.

My big complaint now is trying to keep the really good programmers from the first few batches I trained. Now their training bonds are running out, a lot are going back to their natives to get married or be with their families. I'm running out of incentives I can offer to keep them!

On the plus side, if you come out of uni knowing how to program, once you're in a job, you'll stand out a mile from the rest of the programmers who don't have a clue, so with a bit of luck you'll be promoted quickly.

null,false,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,null,"&gt; *In The Establishment Owen Jones, author of the international bestseller Chavs, offers a biting critique of the British Establishment and a passionate plea for democracy. Behind our democracy lurks a powerful but unaccountable network of people who wield massive power and reap huge profits in the process. In exposing this shadowy and complex system that dominates our lives, Owen Jones sets out on a journey into the heart of our Establishment, from the lobbies of Westminster to the newsrooms, boardrooms and trading rooms of Fleet Street and the City. Exposing the revolving doors that link these worlds, and the vested interests that bind them together, Jones shows how, in claiming to work on our behalf, the people at the top are doing precisely the opposite. In fact, they represent the biggest threat to our democracy today - and it is time they were challenged.

&gt; Praise for Owen Jones' Chavs: ""A passionate and well-documented denunciation of the upper-class contempt for the probes that has recently become so visible in the British class system"". (Eric Hobsbawm, Guardian Books of 2011). ""As with all the best polemics, a luminous anger backlights his prose"". (Economist). ""A bold attempt to rewind political orthodoxies; to reintroduce class as a political variable ...It moves in and out of postwar British history with great agility, weaving together complex questions of class, culture and identity with a lightness of touch. Jones torches the political class to great effect"". (Jon Cruddas, Independent). Owen Jones was born in Sheffield, grew up in Stockport, and studied history at Oxford. His first book, the international bestseller Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class, was long-listed for the Guardian First Book Award and chosen as one of The New York Times top 10 non-fiction books of 2011. In 2013 he received the Young Writer of the Year prize at the Political Book Award. He is a columnist for the Guardian and a frequent broadcaster.*",null,0,null,1434816261,null,0,false,0,cscyubu,null,t3_3ahvy6,null,t1_cscyubu,null,t1_cscy2u1,null,null,null,1437215361,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

I inferred it from what you wrote, that's why didn't quote you. 


I guess I should restate my view on this; if the student does their own work, that's not cheating. They may have questionable methods, but if they manage to write every sentence from their own thoughts, *they* have done the work. If the student pays someone else, or copies without understanding the content they're meant to be studying, then they don't deserve whatever grade they get. Sure, you could argue that they used initiative or resourcefulness or whatever, but they probably couldn't replicate that knowledge in a controlled setting. ie without whatever resource they used. The aim of most academics is to pass on what they know to the next generation of students. If the student is not taking in this knowledge, or simply ticking the right boxes, they aren't fully committed to what they're doing

it should go without saying that this is my opinion, I'm not saying that this is *the* way, the *only* way. Obviously other people will do whatever they feel is appropriate in order to achieve their goals. I don't believe cheating is a legitimate way to achieve anything.

null,false,CheeseMakerThing,null,null,null,"Firstly, it is Warwick University. Warwick University is located in the city of Coventry, with half of the halls of residence lying in in the county of Warwickshire, is fed by Tile Hill train station, a suburb of Coventry, and Coventry train station, has bus routes by Stagecoach Coventry and Warwickshire and National Express Coventry and has nothing to do with Birmingham.

Secondly, how the fuck is Warwickshire not associated with Coventry? That is bullshit. We share radio stations, police and fire services until recently, part of Coventry City lies outside the Coventry Metropolitan Borough and in the county of Warwickshire. It is a 5 minute drive to the admin HQ in Warwickshire, Warwick, from Coventry. The closest hospital for some people living in Coventry is Warwick Hospital. The local airport and national rail station is in Coventry in both cases. Coventry was the largest city in the county from 1066 to 1812, and Birmingham left the county way before Coventry did. There was even talk of creating a Warwickshire T20 cricket team when they renamed the Warwickshire Bears cricket team. The new team would be based in Rugby and Coventry. The new region of Warwickshire after the collapse of the West Midlands Council is devolved into Coventry **and** Warwickshire for fucks sakes. No mention of Birmingham at all which is, conveniently, devolved into Birmingham and the Black Country. The Postal Code for the entire county of Warwickshire is CV for Coventry, not B for Birmingham or Black Country depending on whether you are my Granddad or not.

Coventry wasn't helped by Birmingham in the industrial revolution whatsoever and the industry of Coventry and Birmingham was completely different until the collapse of the weaving industry in England, the canals of each city were only linked in the 20th century shows there was no transfer of goods. The logistics of getting from Coventry to Birmingham without the M6 and A45 are a nightmare, they aren't linked in anyway directly despite being only 15 miles away.

Thirdly, nobody wants to live in Wolverhampton and Coventry. Why would they? They are both shitholes. Hence why people work in Coventry and earn a good amount of money live in Kenilworth, Southam, Rugby, Stratford, Leamington, Warwick, Stoneleigh, Bubbenhall and at a stretch, Solihull.

Finally, the reason they built the Solihull plant is that is like 2 minutes away from Whitley, a part of Coventry. Do you know what else is in Whitley?

Its constantly failed. The UK decided on a road based transport system generations ago and we are all reaping the benefits and drawbacks of it.  
Rail works for bulk transportation between rail heads (eg DIRFT) and over long distances but for over 90% of freight it is better by road.  
I have a lot of sympathy for the guys who get stuck and in most cases I blame the company rather than the driver. 20 years ago I was given an address and either a hand drawn map or a list of directions, today I get an address and if I am lucky a screen print of google which shows nothing. Of course we use satnavs, I use the one built into my phone, but we don't follow it blindly and if you use a bit of common sense then you don't get stuck. Friday I was going up the A1 and they shut J36-J37, the poorly signed diversion was through Doncaster city center and I used a satnav to help me through it.  
.  
As for the foreign drivers who get stuck, reverse the situation. how many of you could find an address in eastern Europe without a satnav? And I know you think a driver should be able to spot a dead end before he gets into it but you be surprised how many delivery/collection points are down country lanes. Also once you are on a road its not easy to turn around.  
Finally, I get tons of abuse from other motorists if I stop before a junction and walk to check if I fit down a road, and if I dare ask in a shop or garage for directions I get more insults about how a proper driver would know where he is going than I do help.",null,0,null,1434818520,null,0,false,0,csczw3f,null,t3_3ai7jb,null,t1_csczw3f,null,t3_3ai7jb,null,null,null,1437215686,null,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

I went to a grammar school and everyone either cheated on the mocks, scived or failed them despite the fact that you'd expect us to be more serious than some standard schools.

Why? Because no-one really cared about the mocks when we had controlled assessments and other stuff going on throughout the year, plus the fact that, for anyone who can organise and stick to a revision timetable from Easter onwards, what they get in the mocks has no bearing on what they get in their final exam.

Expenses plus claims exceed premiums for the private car industry most years. The link I provided in the first place pointed out that out. So you can't go saying that cut costs means that they're actually making profit - cut costs are already included in the figures.

Then, as the main storyline comes to a head in the last two episodes and it *finally* looks like the Doctor's eked out a win, suddenly, the Daleks show up to **fuck shit up**.

And fuck suit up they do: they utterly annihilate all of Planet Earth. They win. Completely and inarguably. 

The next season is the Doctor and any humans he managed to get on the TARDIS before D-Day coping with the **massive** loss they just suffered. The Doctor is in shock, he just shuts down. The humans have to figure out their place in the universe now. Fucked up, tragic shit and the coping that must follow. 

The next season, the Doctor slowly works out some workaround. Maybe, as much as there are ""Fixed Moments"" there are also ""Fixed Societies"" whose importance supersede the Fixed Moments. Maybe the *Daleks* broke the rules of Fixed Moments, and the universe must be put back to rights. After all, the Doctor brought Rose to the final destruction of Earth, so this is clearly not how it was supposed to work out. 

You'd see the Daleks' true power. You'd see them win, and not against some weird alien race — against us.

I was addressing the last line of your comment:

&gt; Also, cheating on mocks is a really effective way to get entered for higher tier and come out with a U.

In case you didn't know, not every school bases higher/lower tier placements on mock results. In fact, there are a numerous schools (like mine) who don't place anyone in the foundation tier.

&gt; If you truly don't care about the results of your mocks, why go to the trouble of cheating? Why not just fail?

Because in the case of my school, they would send grade slips home to your parents, along with a useless scaremongering letter about how your A-Level mocks were very concerning and, in many cases, put you through a 'supervised study' scheme which involved sitting in our school hall silently 'studying' during all of your free periods. It was a huge and unnecessary pain in the arse.

null,false,severedfragile,lfc68,,null,"I cannot describe Skrtel as ""solid"", and PL experience itself means nothing, it's shorthand for the reading and adaptability and comfort with the game, which he hasn't really shown. He still hasn't adapted to the open, relatively-unshielded (which is something Rodgers has failed to address, but that's another conversation) high-ish line we've played the last 3 seasons, so much that Carragher fit in more comfortably than he did, despite Skrtel's superior passing ability. He's  back-foot defender in a team that's built around front-foot football. The only time he's consistently been part of a strong defence was at the middle of a back 3, where his role was specialised to his abilities; he's very good when it comes to late tackles, blocks and dealing with long balls in the air, but not with players dribbling at/around him, passing in front of him, making runs or pretty much any situation leading up to chances. In a back 4 - and we're probably going to be starting off with a 4-3-3 again next season - I have much more confidence in Ilori than Skrtel. He anticipates and deals with danger much quicker and more cleanly, he uses his pace extremely well and is actually comfortable defending on the front foot. He'd fit in much better and already looks a better defender. A Sakho-Ilori partnership is the kind of basis for a whole team, the way Subotic-Hummels or Masch-Busquets-Pique have been for theirs or Hyypia-Carragher was for us - they fit their teams' styles, play to their strengths and dictate the pace and space in a way that fits their team. Skrtel stands out as a player who's suited to the kind of football we were playing 5 years ago, not the kind we're trying to play now.

Here's some highlights:

&gt; an indicative breakdown (2011) from official figures reveals that of
those where the victim’s religion was ‘known’ (n. 1,216), 52 per cent (632) were recorded as religious
hate crimes against Muslims (compared to 26 per cent against people of Jewish faith; and 14 per cent
against people of Christian faith). When it comes to religious hate crime, most victims are Muslim. 

&gt; Figures provided by the CPS from the year 2011-12 reveal that the majority of defendants in
both racist and religiously motivated hate crimes are men (83 per cent), White British (73.6 per cent),
and aged 25-59 (54.2 per cent). Of the principal offence category for racial and religious hate crime,
49.6 per cent involved offences against the person, and 32.5 per cent involved various public order offences

Gifts are definitely given. Traditionally they're keepsakes in silver--rattles, bowls, photo frames etc.--which you'll find in most good jewellers in the UK or department stores like John Lewis, if you're buying the gift after you land in the UK.

In the Church of England as a Godparent, you're expected to be actively involved in bringing up the child in the Christian faith.

In practical terms, unless the childs parents are strict adherents, it's largely symbolic these days - though it would be bad form not to have any future contact with the child whatsoever!  But do bear in mind that you will be taking an active part in the ceremony, rather than being an observer.

It's traditional to offer a gift.  As a Godparent, it's appropriate for this to have religious significance.  A bible, prayer or grace book, or religious symbol such as a crucifix necklace would be suitable; there's nothing wrong with giving a 'childrens bible' as opposed to the full tome if you choose to do so.

Except, his attitude sucks and he disappears in those big games you're talking about, namely the Barca CL games and the entire World Cup. He gets carded for petulant nonsense. He gets within 50 yards of the goal and he rears back and punts it into outer space. He can't follow a single marking assignment. So yes, he has talent. Yes, someone with his skills should be a great fit. But his head is pureed mush inside. So his skills are to waste. This is why he was sold. This is why the press laughed at PSG for the transfer fee they raised. He had a nice game against Chelsea, but in his last season with them he was 1st off the bench as a CB, and whatever name you want to assign the 2 guys that play in front of the defense, Lampard, Ramires and Matic were all preferred, and when the game was tight and in the final third, so was Mikel.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"I think the real story here is actually that 20% of voters are undecided just off that bat. That alone suggests big swings are possible. It's also so far off the actual day, with an unclear question and an uncertain campaign strategy that its hard to really see where people will vote come the day. For example it probably isn't going to be like the Scottish independence referendum where battle lines were already fairly well entrenched.

What this poll suggests is that the vote could ultimately go either way, and nobody is betting on a sure thing. If some big name respected politicians, celebrities and professionals come out in support of an EU exit it could tip things with those margins. If certain [EU officials](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2916123/I-won-t-grovel-Britain-EU-European-Commission-president-compares-UK-s-membership-doomed-love-affair.html), with an [axe to grind](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/27/david-cameron-loses-jean-claude-juncker-vote-eu), don't learn to keep their mouths shut at inopportune times, that could also tip things in favor of a surge of anti-EU British nationalism, especially where repeated perceived insults could produce an unexpected vote with middle-England.

My feeling is this vote is the EU's (and by extension in the government and opposition parties) vote to lose. All the EU really needs to do to secure a UK vote to stay in is;

* Acknowledge in its written constitution at some future date (requiring treaty change) that the UK does not have to integrate with every single aspect of ever-closer-union (without actually going into any specifics).
* Make some tokenistic gesture of reforming some of the EU's inefficiencies like the common agricultural and fisheries policies.
* The real winner is immigration reform. If they allowed a migrant cap I suspect that the EU would be looking at a victory in the 70-85% range, since really that is most rational peoples main concern. Failing that Camerons proposed welfare reforms or some watered down version, coupled with an emergency lock and opt-outs from future nations joining might go some way.
* Sad as it sounds, but a little bit of groveling about how important the UK is, and how central it is to the EU would probably go a long way. We are after all the 7th largest economy in the world, half of the EU's nuclear deterrent, it's main defense spender and our capital is the EUs largest financial centre. We're also set to become the blocs most populous nation in the next 2-3 decades. The reality is they have to acknowledge that losing the UK would be a monumental blow to its credibility. Being rejected by a monolithic bastion of democracy like the UK would send shock waves around the world (and probably wouldn't do either the EU or the UK any favors).

The danger is the EU reads too much into these 60% support numbers. My feeling is if they do that and cruise through to referendum day without having made some significant concessions, they'll end up looking at a surprise result.

Having said all the above, the EU will play it like Westminster played the Scottish independence referendum - you don't go in on day 1 offering your best give-aways. You keep them in reserve, and as a bad outcome looks more likely you offer them. I.e. when the UK looks like it might vote to leave, then you start offering up major immigration reform, in the same way that further fiscal devolution was offered to Scots in the closing days of the independence referendum.",null,0,null,1434823672,null,0,1434824396,0,csd2e7u,null,t3_3ai7jj,null,t1_csd2e7u,null,t3_3ai7jj,null,null,null,1437217184,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

Like is there a tradition of some sorts that everyone in the UK knows about but I wouldn't? (like the Godfather always buys pink petunias for the girl on the day of her christening)

You will be chiefly responsible for the traditional goat sacrifice that’s a key part of any  Church of England Christening.

In fact, as the Godfather, it’s likely that you'll be expected to provide the goat itself.

Unfortunately, due to the period of prolonged austerity that the UK is currently undergoing the price of these creatures has skyrocketed in recent years. 

If you’re particularly religious yourself then you’ll obviously be concerned about appeasing the correct deity. In order to do this you really have no choice but to use an *actual* goat. 

If I were you I’d consider looking into buying one in America and [flying it here](http://www.wikihow.com/Ship-a-Pet-to-the-UK). This is obviously a bit more hassle but will potentially save you a fair bit of money overall. [[Here’s a handy guide to keeping your goat healthy during the trip](http://www.allgoats.com/health.htm)]

However, if you’re not into all of this superstitious mumbo jumbo (and are only really in it to keep the natives happy) then you may be able to sneakily substitute the goat for a far cheaper animal.

As you’re a mod of /r/ethicaldilemmas you may find this to be immoral at first but I feel I should point out that the cost of a sheep + novelty horns + superglue can still be more than half the cost of a mature goat.

Although a horned sheep can make a passable goat I recommend getting your friend quite drunk before the big event (lest he or she suspect something’s amiss).


&gt; Do people generally give gifts (financial or otherwise) for this occasion? If so, any direction here would be helpful.

Nah, the goat/horned sheep will be more than enough.

&gt; Any other info you might provide that would help me not look like an idiot would be much appreciated.

Dyer, Routledge, Montero, Ayew and Barrow all competing for those wing positions. I'm sure Barrow will get loaned out, but still absolutely fierce competition for those positions. 

Monk has said several times he wants competition for each position and signing Mitrovic add just that. Who is fighting for the striker position other than Gomis? Sure and Oliveira loan would be nice, but lets be realistic that doesn't create any 'competition' for the spot.

Well no shit. It obviously makes things harder. But that not always a bad thing. Good competition helps players growth. We have a young team the more they can play top teams the better for their development. It's more than just winning the league. Winning the premier league is always going to be difficult. And the harder it is the better the PL looks. I would rather have a league with 4 or 5 teams competing for the championship than just 1. 

&gt;&gt;That's because you lack a brain that's capable of comprehending how good competition is for players. I'm going to chop that up to you never playing a highly competitive sport. You improve more when people can test your skills.

&gt;i realize that competition helps the league overall but in what fucking world is giving cech to a direct rival HELPING us, its just not and i strongly suggest you either think about it without desperately hammering home your point about taking points away from rivals (when we are also arsenals rival who in giving cech to arsenal will have a harder time defeating arsenal) and come to the same conclusion or go and check in to your nearest mental health institute. 

You keep saying direct rival but it means nothing. Obviously it will be more difficult to beat them but it will be more difficult for everyone in the league. This can result in other opponents dropping points just like us. Yes it makes Arsenal a little better but that can help us just as much as hurt us. Say we end up beating them both games and Cech makes a few great saves against United and United end up dropping points. To think it can only harm the PL table for us is silly and a joke.
&gt;&gt;Not really

&gt;yeah i mean that szczesny bloke is a young buffon, how can you honestly say that they have had a world class keeper in recent years, you're deluded - the downvotes on this thread should honestly help you arrive to that conclusion.

He isn't a bad keeper. He has done quite well their. Not as good as Cech but he isn't mediocre.

What does that mean? Are the species out there that aren't looking to survive?

You don't even need sentience to be selfish, let alone a sense of self. Selfish can simply describe behaviour which benefits one to the detriment of others (even if the case is only one of not opting for the behaviour that maximizes total welfare).

&gt; Humans, being sentient, are able to reason and empathise.

Yes, because it benefits us. Us being each and every individual.

&gt;  It is a clear choice to be selfish or not.

Not clear at all. Some people lack the necessary prerequisites to be selfless (if there even is such a thing), e.g. psychopaths. Not to mention the whole issue of whether or not people have a choice at all, that age old trouble with free will &amp; determinism.

&gt; It does not reflect well on your character when to try to justify selfishness because

It does not reflect well on you to try and veil insults, at least have the balls to say what you want. As for justifying, I'm not, I'm merely describing.

And if you really believe people aren't selfish then how do you explain people's actions? What motivates them into being if not to improve their situation?

It's a cliche that player's development stagnates unless they're getting regular football, but some of the areas that need improvement - positioning, awareness, and the general reading of the game - are improved much more easily by playing regular football than by training alone. There's no guarantee he'll stagnate, of course, or that he won't. But it is a risk that we wouldn't take with Song.

We can't guarantee him regular games at this point: He may get them but equally he may not. This is why it's so hard for young players to integrate into the top squads generally. Until we feel like he's ready to start somewhat regularly (which, for us, means starting above the likes of Matic or Fabregas) or until we feel his reading of the game is as good as it's going to get, an experienced player who has peaked will lose nothing by sitting on the bench; RLC can't say the same.

&gt;In the New Testament (NT) there are at least three passages that may refer to homosexual activity: Romans 1:26–27, 1 Corinthians 6:9–10, and 1 Timothy 1:9–10. A fourth passage, Jude 1:7, is often interpreted as referring to homosexuality. None of the four gospels mentions the subject directly, and there is nothing about homosexuality in the Book of Acts, in Hebrews, in Revelation, or in the letters attributed to James, Peter, and John. Jesus may be restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples when he cites Genesis during a discussion of marriage (Matthew 19:4-6 and Mark 10:6-9).



&gt;The presumed references to 'homosexuality' itself in the New Testament hinge on the interpretation of three specific Greek words, arsenokoitēs (ἀρσενοκοίτης), malakos (μαλακός), and porneia.[1][2] While it is not disputed that the three Greek words concern sexual relations between men (and possibly between women), some academics interpret the relevant passages as a prohibition against pederasty or prostitution rather than homosexuality per se, while other scholars have presented counter arguments.[3][4][5] The historical context of the passages has also been a subject of debate.

He's too stuck in the past imo to win. More people are self-employed than ever and don't belong to unions, and with so many having small businesses we need someone who will champion small wealth creators while keeping the 50p tax rate etc, like Burnham and Cooper.

I watched the hustings with my Dad, who's voted for the winning party in every election since he could vote. Out of all them, he said only Yvette was PM material. We both liked the way she defended the welfare state and talked about the need for discussion and gradual reduction in nuclear weapons in a dangerous world like today's. She was also the only one who talked about the jobs of the future that will require a more skilled workforce, but also didn't forget the need for a strong vocational education.

Kendall both struck us as a wannabe Blair but without the talent and speaking skills, while Burnham is currently struggling to make a mark on where he stands (apart from working class out of Westminster bubble football down t'pub lad).

I'm probably going with Yvette 1st, Corbyn 2nd or 3rd, Burnham 2/3, Kendall 4th.

null,false,DocOccupant,null,null,null,"I think you're wrong about the Daleks.  I think the reason you don't think they're scary is that you're too familiar with them.  But I think you've missed some critical concepts and, as a result, don't see them as threatening.  There are a couple of things I've noticed that might make you look at them differently.

1: THEY NEVER RUN AWAY.
The Daleks always seem to move forward.  Every time we see them, they're heading right for us and they never stop.  They're relentless.  In the Classic series, you could drive them off or make them pause.  Not any more.  Whatever upgrade they got from the Time War, they're still using it.  So all the Daleks we see are the same model as the ones that beat Gallifrey to its knees.

2: EVERYONE IS SCARED OF THEM.
Even Jack ""Functionally Immortal"" Harkness wet himself when he knew he was facing the Daleks.  All of the people we meet, when they hear about Daleks, get a look of panic in their eyes.  Everyone knows they're bad news.

This was pretty much the case in the classic series, too, where there were alliances against the Daleks.

3: THEY'RE MANIPULATIVE  
The Class of '63 had emotions.  Go watch the story.  The Daleks are intelligent, cunning, manipulative and terrified for their own survival.  They aspire.  The Daleks we see later go down the emotionless route because they get written as robots for a while.  They're actually returning to where they were, and right now even a disarmed Dalek is dangerous.  They can talk you into making mistakes.

Just like The Doctor.

4: The Doctor is scared of them.  He's more scared, these days, of being like them.  But then, he's been through hundreds of years of fighting them so I imagine a lot of the fear has worn off.  He knows them too well now for real fear.  That's why the writers have to create new ways for them to threaten him.

null,false,Iainfletcher,null,null,null,"OK some basic economics. 

If you want to reduce the debt, there are three ways it's done (spoiler: none of them are run a surplus):

1) Grow your GDP. This increases tax income but most importantly, as long as growth is higher than the interest on your debt, it shrinks debt as a proportion of GDP.

2) Let inflation do it for you. Again as long as inflation is above interest rates your debt is effectively worth less each year. 

3) Use windfall money like mobile network licence auctions or similar to pay bits off as you go. 

Our debt is somewhere in the region of £1.5 TRILLION (that's a thousand billion). Even if we ran a surplus of £15bn a year (highly unlikely if not impossible) it'd take us 100 years to pay it off from surplus alone. Of course you don't want the current deficit getting above the rate of growth so obviously you can't spend as much as you like no one is suggesting that. 

What you want to do is borrow when it's cheap. Currently it's cheap as chips. Think of it as if mortgages were at 1% and everyone would give you as many mortgages as you want. Wouldn't you buy a few houses, knowing that house prices will rise at more than 1%?

Our current debt to GDP rations about 80%. That's not huge, the IMF says we could sustain it indefinitely. If you have a mortgage your debt to income ratio I'd wager would be significantly worse. 

Another point to consider is that, unlike you or I who will die one day, a government can literally be in debt forever with no consequence. We are no more ""leaving debt for our children"" than you are paying off World War 2 or any other government spending. 

Finally, not all spending is created equal. Some government spending can have returns many multiples of the outlay. There should be scrutiny of spending but not an automatic assumption that spending is bad. 

Here's the kicker: you need the growth and all the evidence suggests that reducing government spending shrinks the economy. By not spending to invest you choke off growth and income further down the line. And as I've shown you need that to pay off the debt.

Well, Kudos for admitting/acknowledging it, but there's a place to call leadership into contest, or an avenue, and feeding into media-witch-hunts isn't it.  

I recognise what you're saying, just saying there's a better time, timing, and place - and even avenue.

Because, one way actually works more like Lupus, where it's the system's own autoimmune system attacking itself.  Even if Lupus wins, the system it inhabits loses.  The other way is a more generic approach within the party protocol.  Which again means I'm more inclined to the 'watch and wait' approach.

&gt;I'm not against Farage as leader because of Bloom at any stretch, I think Bloom being forced out of UKIP was a very good thing.

For the record I was actually a Bloom defender right until the last straw.  Not because I believed in Bloom, rather when Bloom was good he was very, very good (and on form he really was).  It was more that Bloom forgot that media ran outside a pure-Yorkshire 'call a spade a spade' mindset, and often forgot media savvy.  That in itself made him a hazard.

The hazard became too much.

&gt;I mean, for me personally I've been against Farage leading the campaign and such since the result of the election really, however there are a lot of others which are coming with this opinion since the interview.

American Kennel club recognises 157 dog breeds

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States#Fatalities_reported_in_2015 

2015 - 5 reported U.S. fatalities - 2 by Pit Bulls:

&gt;The man died after suffering bites to his head and left arm from his son's dog. He was taking down a Christmas tree when the dog attacked him.

&gt;This man was killed while trying to resuscitate the dog's owner from a heart attack. The pit bull was not registered with the city, despite ordinance requiring all pit bulls in the city be registered. Both men were pronounced dead at a local hospital

2014 – 32 reported U.S. fatalities – 20 (62%) were Pit Bulls – all other by 6 breeds

2013 – 32 Reported – 26 (81%) were Pit Bulls – all other by 5 breeds

2012 – 35 reported – 19 (54%) were Pit Bulls – all other by 5 breeds

2011 – 33 reported – 20 (60%) were Pit bulls – all other by 4 breeds

A nine-year (1979–88) study of fatal dog attacks in the United States
found that dogs characterized as pit bulls were implicated in 42 of the
101 attacks where the breed was known

A 1991 study found that 94% of attacks on children by pit bulls were unprovoked, compared to 43% for other breeds.

A 5-year (1989–94) review of fatal dog attacks in the U.S. determined that pit bulls and pit bull mixed breeds were implicated in 24 (29%) of the 84 deaths in which breed was recorded.

null,false,BraveSirRobin,null,null,null,"&gt; You can't pick the government cuts you like as ""good housekeeping"" and lump the ones you don't like into ""austerity"".

I'm not talking about ""cuts"", everything should be always done efficiently and should be constantly measured on how successful it is. This is a constant, regardless of the wider state of the economy. 

Government's try to avoid such metrics as it's a constant source of criticism for them. 

&gt; Reducing government spending can improve the economy by allocating resources in a more efficient manner.

Again, that should be a constant, not strictly linked to ""cuts"". 

&gt; If by trickle-down theory you mean supply-side economics, then no, the IMF have not admitted one of the major macroeconomic schools of thought is nonsense

Are you saying that it's *not* nonsense? The inherent flaw is that giving the rich tax cuts only leads to larger savings accounts. The money does not go straight back into buying goods and services; an equivalent tax cut given to the lesser paid results in far greater direct benefit. 

You could argue that those saving accounts drive new ventures but it's so indirect and a non-exclusive choice for business cash injections that it might as well be meaningless. And that's assuming the money is even invested within the UK. And if funding business is the goal, why not just do so directly via government grants?

""Austerity"" is simply a scam to pillage the public coffers. Did you view the google trends link I posted? The whole movement is entirely manufactured as a PR exercise.

I think we paid Song quite a bit and it could be higher in the editor then it is now. I know people wont know this exactly, but maybe have a good guesstimate.

I bombed A-level bio and chem because I couldn't remember the exact phrasing required for the exams at the end of the term. 

Turns out I'm better at essay subjects, redid my first year at college with new subjects, and am now about to go into my third year at university, where I'm achieving 2:1s and 1sts. I probably wouldn't have been able to do this if I did A-levels now. I'm watching my brother go through it and I'm really astounded. 

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, it's not just about 'lacking work ethic', the system is inherently putting disabled students at a disadvantage.

null,false,esau1,null,null,null,"Not every central midfielder is the same and not every role in central midfield is the same either.

Coutinho is a natural attacking midfielder who performed well in a handful of games as the shuttler in a diamond midfield. You wouldn't put him as the deepest man in a midfield three and expect things to work out. I'm fairly certain that Lucas was never tried at attacking midfield and was bought in with a view to develop him as a DM. He played attacking midfield in Brazil but has never done that since because he doesn't have the skill set to succeed there at a high level. I reject your usage of Gerrard because he's one of the most complete players of all time. Not every player has that versatility.

Rodgers has shown that he will shoehorn young players into positions they're not familiar with. Sometimes this is good, because the young player rounds out his tactical knowledge through experiencing another role. Sometimes it's bad, because the young player doesn't adjust to the role and his performances suffer because of it. This seemed to be what was happening to Can in the latter stage of the season - stuck at wing-back or right back and constantly being beaten because he isn't a natural full back.

With Can and Sahin I see parallels, not least because they're both German-Turkish central midfielders. If Rodgers persists with Can in defence, especially at full back or wingback, then I am very worried about his future development and his desire to stay at a club where he isn't given a chance in his natural position.

Yeah we signed Cesc who does really well at breaking up the play against the smaller teams who play defensive against us and yeah him and Matic were the best midfield duo in England. That doesn't diminish the fact that we had a ridiculously good record against the top teams last season party due to having someone do that role. This season however we've still done good but worse against the top teams because we didn't have someone playing that role. 

Luiz or a Luiz type player offers more in the holding role alongside Matic than Cesc does against a team like City. That's not saying Luiz is better. Just different games require different players and since selling Luiz we haven't replaced that role.

If you go down the road from Moseley there's a rock climbing place and as someone else mentioned, there's the Oort cafe. There's also a sort of community/meeting place behind the post office which has a lot of stuff on.

If you like gaming, try the video game society at the University of Birmingham, Aston or BCU (they tend to meet up together).  There is also a gaming place in town, although I've not been there yet.   The Unis also have a lot of other societies, you can join as an external person fine, although normally you can just turn up, no-one cares in the slightest.

The music stuff is almost too much to go into - the Hare and Hounds up in Kings Heath has a lot of live music, I'd recommend trying out a few bands there. I'd also check out the parks nearby, Highbury park is good and Cannon Hill park, which also has an arts center and bar. It also has the Nature Centre, which is like a nifty little miniature zoo.

There's a whole shitload of clubs and bars in town, including rock nights, live music and other stuff. 

I've also found political groups a good way to meet people, but it depends if you're interested in politics at all.

&gt; Most people think of inflammation as a small red painful itchy lump, or a swollen knee or ankle. They think of it as local. A real flu gives a hint at how it can be a whole body response.

&gt; You won’t hear about this in relation to air pollution from the newspapers, TV, parliament or government bodies. Plausible deniability is one of the reasons for “not knowing” why the body’s rhythms of inflammation make a nonsense of the way averages of pollution, and the general numbers game, are played out in London. Self-amplifying cascades are the order of the day. A single peak episode will trigger an unstoppable, uncontrollable immune reaction leaving the whole body more sensitive to the next lot of pollution and awash with activated cells, new cells breeding fast and swamped with little known hormones, some of which stay around for 24 hours or longer.

&gt; When this pollution becomes long term, or when we have a long heat wave this gets really serious and leads to permanent scarring and damage. If a child has lived long enough in such conditions the lungs never grow properly, the wounded lungs scarring, if it is in the womb its development is affected.Low birth weight,preterm delivery and therefore infant mortality all rise in frequency.

I can't say I've watched more than a two episodes of The Fan Show, so be prepared for **Potentially Uninformed Opinions**^TM


Firstly, while a great many different personalities do indeed inhabit this fandom, I feel like the Fan Show is targeted at a specific set of fans whose opinion is similar to that of the host's. Which is no bad thing, that's just the way things work, really. They could have had a bland News at 10 presenter (No offense News at 10) that simply relates the latest Doctor Who news and that would have been easily watched by everyone but it's unlikely anyone would actually like it. But with a person that has a distinct personality it keeps a good portion of those fans around to keep watching. And of course, not everyone is going to connect with the host but there are always other people on YouTube doing the same thing that you can go and find and watch.


As for using a famous internet celebrity, well... 
I spend quite a lot of time on YouTube, I'm not going to lie. And, as you might suspect I watch quite a lot of Doctor Who related videos.  However, I've never heard of Danisonfire. 
Or AmazingPhil.
Or thatcherjoe.
Or Zoella.
Or Pointlessblog.
Or Marcus butler.

So you see, it wouldn't really matter in terms of YouTube celebrity because there is always going to be a chunk of people who have never heard of that presenter outside of the people who watch them on their channel.

Moreover, I'm assuming that as you've said that they are fans of the show that they have talked about Doctor Who in their own videos, which would lead me to believe that their audience already watch it and if they don't then I doubt that would be likely to change. 
And I wouldn't expect that the famous YouTube personality wouldn't bring in viewers from outside their own viewers. 


However, moving into the question in the title, I don't think that the BBC are re-enforcing the Whovian stereotype all that much. They are catering to a specific set of fans, but wouldn't say that they were re-enforcing a stereotype or forcing that stereotype on the fans. 
But even if they were re-enforcing the stereotype, would it matter all that much? I personally don't really care what other people or fandoms think of Doctor Who fans, and I'd be surprised if other fans did too.

Many white anglo-saxon christians use such arguments as a pretext to excuse racially motivated behaviour. The majority of muslims in the UK are from the middle east, hence people of a middle-eastern heritage tend to be viewed with greater suspicion than white europeans, regardless of religion. It's easy enough to go to /pol/ or /r/european and see someone complaining about turban-wearing terrorists, regardless of the fact that the turban has a closer association with sikhs than muslims. Anecdotal of course, I can't be bothered to look for a source but spend any time in either group and you'll see the sentiment crop up regularly. In essence: ""you're a muslim and therefore you don't fit into my culture"" actually means ""you're from a part of the world I don't like and therefore you don't fit into my culture"" to many of the people that frequent /pol/ and /r/european. For many it's not about religion (although they can claim otherwise), it's about race.

And furher to that, if you stage a public burning of books *in general*, be it the Quran, bible or 50 Shades Of Grey then people will take offence no matter of the content. The symbolism of book burning has a strong association with atrocities committed throughout history and if you even limited it to the yellow pages then people will still view it as inflammatory because, you know, nazis did it. And while I doubt you personally served in a certain war that ended in 1945, you possibly have relatives that did. You could always ask them what significance book-burning might have. It's better to go to the source after all.

Finally, even Katie Price acknowledges that she didn't write her books.

null,false,steefen7,null,null,null,"I agree with you, actually. On second thought I think my issue isn't as much with signing these filler-type players, but more with Jose's lack of rotation which has cost us very quality bench players and kept out guys like Lukaku (not that I'm saying I want him anymore). 

We played brilliant football in the first half of the season, but then it all seemed to run dry in the second half partially due to injuries to key players, but also down to drop in form in certain players which you could argue was due to fatigue. This is why I think we need another player similar to Fabregas in the midfield and of similar quality if we're not going to promote youth. When some players tire, another one of almost the same quality can step.

The problem we have right now is that when Matic and Fabregas are tired or suspended, we have to rely on Ramires and Mikel, which are layovers from a very different Chelsea team that played a very different style. I guess what I'm saying is, we need to rotate more so we can support a strong bench that will allow us to compete in the CL and the league simultaneously. An added benefit of rotating even without adding more top notch players is that it allows to blood the youth more often.

If we don't start rotating more we'll find ourselves in the same position every season where we can't support as strong a bench as we'd like and when a key player goes down we risk dropping points.",null,0,null,1434838174,null,0,false,0,csd9cm2,null,t3_3aik5w,null,t1_csd9cm2,null,t1_csd4k9p,null,null,null,1437221141,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

&gt;__Railway time__ was the standardised time arrangement first applied by the [Great Western Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Western_Railway) in England in November 1840, the first recorded occasion when different [local times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_mean_time) were synchronised and a single [standard time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_time) applied. Railway time was progressively taken up by all railway companies in Great Britain over the following two to three years. The schedules by which trains were organised and the times [station clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_clock) displayed was brought in line with the local time for London or ""London Time"", the time set at [Greenwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich) by the [Royal Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Observatory,_Greenwich), which was already widely known as [Greenwich Mean Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time) (GMT).

You know how when you learn to drive a car, you kinda get it and it makes sense, but you still have to think about adding some accelerator when you let the clutch out. For me, just getting the muscle memory sorted meant I could properly get comfortable with riding the bike. Then, when it comes to the ""how to be a road user"" side of things, I was already confident from being a confident and assertive driver. 

When I drive, I make my decisions and I follow through with them, and in a car after 7 years its easy enough to do. But doing that on a bike took a bit of practice. 

**I'm not saying don't take your DAS course and go straight onto a big bike asap**, but if you're not the most comfortable of riders already then take a few months on a smaller bike out on your own and just get comfortable with doing the riding. 

I really think I passed my DAS course and tests first time around because I was comfortable and confident as a motorcyclist *and* as a road user. The DAS training just helped me think about modifying my car driving skills and morphing and applying it to motorcycle handling; things like braking distances, shoulder checks, lane discipline and so on. 

I did my course with an organization called lightning pass in Cowley, near Oxford. They have a section on their website about ""[How to fail your test](http://www.lightningpass.com/how-fail-your-test-1)"" - have a read ... it was very helpful for me. One tip? Squeeze your legs when you do slow manoeuvers, you'll find you have so much more balance on the bike when you do. 

Its entirely up to you. I found riding around on a 125 for a bit extremely useful and I passed both tests first time round with 2 minors. But people go straight onto big bikes with no previous training and pass their tests so different strokes for different folks.

I didn't say Coventry isn't associated with Warwickshire, I said it was more closely associated with Birmingham because Birmingham is the power house in the region, and as you said large parts of Birmingham were in Warwickshire, hence Warwickshire Cricket Club being based in Birmingham, not Coventry.

My point wasn't that JLR weren't based in Coventry, I didn't doubt that it did, my point was the Coventry is insignificant so they don't shout about it like companies based on London, Manchester and Birmingham do. In fact I would argue that JLR are more closely associated with the Castle Bromwich site in Birmingham rather than their head office. 

The simple fact is that outside of Birmingham none of the West Midlands matters, take Birmingham away and Carillon wouldn't be in Wolverhampton, JLR wouldn't be in Coventry.

null,false,sjampen,lfc99,,null,"I would sign almost anyone over Llorente and Benteke. I cannot fathom why people want to see Benteke in Liverpool. Not because he isn't a good player, because he is a good player, but because he is not a very good fit in our squad. Llorente who is far more stationary like Rickie Lambert is even worse, and Benteke does have decent movement, but his strength is being a target man to play the ball up on, before he moves into the box. Those strengths doesn't match very well with out key players Henderson, Coutinho and Sturridge, who need someone who is able to get the ball and drive it forward or pass it quickly and move into another passable position. Quick movement and powerfull drives, that gives our strikers an opportunity to run behind our opponents. Thats what brought us succes throughout BRs tenure, its what almost brought us a title and its the main strength of Sturridge and Henderson, and partly of Coutinhos. Carlos Bacca is a brilliant fit for that style, Luis Suarez was the perfect fit. 

Who do I want? Its a difficult question and i'm no scout. The best possible opportunity was not to sell Suarez, which wasn't gonna happen. I would welcome Bacca, dont take my post as anything else. Bacca just has several flaws that scares me. Who else? My dream signing would be Carlos Tevez, but he is apparently off to Boca and why would he join us from Juve? From Italy Higuain has also been mention, and he is a very clinical striker who would fit well with us, although he doesn't provide the same as Tevez when it comes to pressuring the opposition. Inter won't sell us Icardi(or Kovacic for that matter) right after he extended, but he is the Benteke style striker who we would fit into our system, more movement and better in the passing build up game, not as strong, but similar-ish. Lacazette is a brilliant fit, but he is in a special situation like Tevez. Its not that we cannot buy him, the problem is that he has a special connection to Lyon, meaning that even if we unlikely end up as the winner of the war fom him against PSG, Bayern etc, he STILL might not be interested in leaving Lyon. Lacazette reminds me of Daniel Sturridge, he would be a perfect fit next to him in front of Coutinho. After those rumored players, we're leaving discussing and hoping and speculating but: Vietto(Is he better and more accomplished than Bacca), Aubameyang(performs inconsistently and plays for Dortmund), Griezmann(plays for Atletico), Cavani(has been up and down since leaving Napoli), Jovetic(Injured, never really performed THAT well in the BPL, plays for City), Jackson Martinez(Apparently went to AC Milan, i personally isn't as impressed with him), Benzema? 

Nobody is saying its easy, but why would we sign players like Benteke or Llorente when they cannot contribute to what makes us play the best? Again, im not against Bacca, i'm just scared of a player who played 2 season in a strong league and 4 in Europe, because we absolutely NEED a superb striker. Its the most crucial thing in this transfer window, and I had hoped that signing free transfer players who honestly doesn't impress me one bit, would mean that would splash the saved money, both in regards to wages and transferfees, and improve the most crucial need we have: Make Tevez and Lacazette decide against us, give Napoli and offer they cannot refuse, pay Atletico for Griezmann.

Besides there is nothing stopping people doing AS exams. They will still exist but if you chose to continue with the A-Level those AS exams just don't count any more.

I think you may have misunderstood.  The police in this country have very wide-ranging powers to force entry without a warrant - it's not the ""always necessary"" protection you might have seen on TV or heard about from the US.  However, a belief that there is evidence of a crime on the property is insufficient.  I don't see why the police would lie about it when it would be so easy to force entry using their legitimate legal powers.

&gt;When I told my dad what had happened he was shocked. The motorbike has an immobiliser that only my dad has the key too and is locked in a garage. There's no way my brother could have used the bike without his dads permission.

The law has changed - it's now illegal to keep a vehicle without insurance, even if you never drive it on a public road, unless you've made a Statutory Off-Road Notification to the DVLA.  So unless there is a SORN in effect in relation to the vehicle, you may still be committing an offence.  A sure way to tell is if it has a number plate - if so then it's a motor vehicle and must be either insured or SORNed.  However, the police cannot seize the vehicle unless they have required its driver to produce his license or proof of insurance and he has failed to do so, or unless they have attempted to stop the vehicle and the driver has failed to stop for long enough.

With relation to the driving of uninsured vehicles, the police may seize vehicles which are driven or have been driven by drivers who have failed to produce their driving license or proof of insurance for examination, if the officer has reason to believe that the driver does not have an appropriate license or the vehicle is uninsured.  They may force entry to any premises (other than a private dwelling - this means they can force entry to your garage as long as there is no internal door connecting it to your house) in order to seize the vehicle.

They can also seize a vehicle (and force entry for the purpose of seizing it) if the driver failed to stop when directed to do so, any time in the 24 hours following the direction to stop.

Police powers to seize vehicles are listed under [Section 165A of the Road Traffic Act 1988](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/165A).

Is it possible that your brother was using the vehicle without your dad's permission and then failed to stop for the police?

Unfortunately the only legal advice which can be offered at this stage is that if he was driving and the concentration of the chemical in his blood exceeded that limit, however tiny, then he is breaking the law.

You don't need to be ""intoxicated"" to commit the offence.  Driving while unfit through drugs (i.e. driving while intoxicated by drugs), and driving while the concentration of drugs in your bloodstream exceeds the prescribed limit, are two completely different offences.

The law has changed; there are now maximum limits for certain chemicals in the blood stream, and driving while the amount of that chemical in your bloodstream exceeds the prescribed limit is an offence in itself.  Its effect on your driving is immaterial to the offence.  If the law says driving while the level in your blood is 2ug/100ml is a crime, and you are driving with 2ug/100ml in your blood, then you're committing an offence.

It's like, imagine if instead of alcohol and drugs, the law banned driving in high heels.  It doesn't matter if your driving is objectively unaffected by your footwear - the law says driving in high heels is illegal, and its actual effect on your driving is immaterial to whether or not you commit the offence.

- If you are going to register for VAT, consider opting for the Flat Rate scheme, if your non-reclaimable expenses are likely to be small.

- Do consider setting yourself up as a limited company (see above) rather than as self-employed. There are many benefits, not including the tax advantages.

- Find a good small business accountant, who will do the (monthly) real-time earnings reporting to HMRC for you. I don't use an umbrella company. My accountant charges me £200pa for real-time reporting and about £900pa for doing company accounts and reporting. VAT is payable on top of these figures.

- For each invoice you send, deduct the NI and Corporation Tax due immediately and put it in a savings account. That way, when the VAT and CT are payable, the money will be there ready. Don't spend what you owe!

Attacking wise, I agree. Defensively, he was poor.

I'm fully aware Song wasn't just passing to one player, it's just that most of his successful passes/assists were towards RVP. They developed a really good understanding between each other, got to the point where all Song had to do was just do a little chip over the defence and RVP was in all the time.

You will have to push your pistons back into the calipers though, if you can't do this by hand then try and get some leverage with your old pads and a screwdriver or similar.

Global life expectancy now stands at a new high of 71.5 years, up six years since 1990. In India, life expectancy is up seven years for men, and 10 for women. It’s rising faster in the impoverished east of Africa than anywhere else on the planet. In Rwanda and Ethiopia, life expectancy has risen by 15 years.

The World Bank’s rate of extreme poverty (those living on less than $1.25 a day) has more than halved since 1990. The number of malnourished children in developing regions has fallen as a percentage from 23.6% to 11.8% 

Average per capita incomes grew by 3.7 per cent per year in low-income countries between 2000 and 2010, and by only 0.5 per cent per year in high-income countries. The poor countries are getting richer quicker than the rich countries at the moment.

Also, selfishly for us, in the last winter the figure for elderly people dying from the cold had fallen to 18,200 - the lowest ever recorded.

Things are a lot better for the poor now than they were just twenty years ago. We've seen massive changes in where wealth is in the world and a fundamental shift in economic power towards India and China where previously poor individuals have moved upwards into the middle and upper classes.

b/c he's a genius ;)

And for Alonso &gt; Scholes. Any one with a brain could tell you. Absolutely. You must be with out one tho, b/c even **him and his own teammates** disagree. You're more delusional than Rodgers. 



*Cesc Fabregas*: “He is the one whose level I aspire to. He is the best player in the Premier League.”






**Xabi Alonso: “I’ve still got Paul Scholes’ shirt at home which I swapped with him once. When I was at Liverpool he was one of the players I liked most. Maybe he’s not valued as much as he should be in England because of the style of football there and because he keeps a low profile. Perhaps he would have been more valued in Spain, where midfielders like him form part of the ‘ideal.’ Fans in Spain rate him very highly and I admire him a huge amount.”**



*Andres Iniesta*: “Rooney is one of the best players in the world and I love watching him play. But if you had to pick out only one, then for their history and for all that they have achieved it would have to be Paul Scholes. He's a shining example for any player.”

*Xavi Hernandez*: “In the last 15 to 20 years the best central midfielder that I have seen — the most complete — is Scholes. I have spoken with Xabi Alonso about this many times. Scholes is a spectacular player who has everything. He can play the final pass, he can score, he is strong, he never gets knocked off the ball and he doesn’t give possession away. If he had been Spanish then maybe he would have been valued more.”

I said he effected big games well but as has been said many of times it was the role that effected the games so well, not the player himself, which is why somebody should have been brought in to do that role when he left. 

We did draw or win all our games against the top teams yeah, but drew a lot more than we won compared to last season. Take City and Lampard's goal for example. That would have been less likely had we had a player in that role next to Matic. United can be another example,  Van Persie scored in the 90th minute and it's fair to say Zouma was at fault for it. At this point in the season Zouma hadn't played that role yet and he'd barely played any minutes so again, having a specific player to do that job could have stopped us dropping 2 points. Maybe we wouldn't have been destroyed 5-3 by Spurs(which is 100% a big game) if we had that type of player. Another thing that's for sure is David Luiz wouldn't have let Sterling bobble through our team and score the equalizer in the Liverpool game. That's just a couple of examples though.

Oh and btw, we didn't even lose in the second leg of the Champs League. 

It was more about the teams game plan and ethos? No because we still tried it with Ramires, the odd time with Mikel and a few times with Cesc, it just didn't work.

Actually... that's been around a lot longer than Moffat. In fact Robert Shearman introduced the concept into the new series in Dalek and RTD then used it in several other stories. He even had to lampshade that the Daleks in the Series 4 finale were actually one of the only times the Doctor has fought proper Daleks in his era. Moffat has only used proper Daleks using Daleks with emotions only twice:

* Asylum of the Daleks - Oswin is an insane Dalek that was converted from a human. Introduced as an anomaly. All the other Daleks are portrayed as proper Daleks.  

* Into The Dalek - Rusty witnesses a star exploding which damages him and enables him to think freely. Again, introduced as an anomaly and all other Daleks are proper Daleks. 

Moffat has only used the idea twice and in wildly different scenarios. Moffat also uses the Daleks less than RTD. 

RTD era Dalek appearances: 

* Dalek

* Bad Wolf/Parting of the Ways

* Army of Ghosts/Doomsday

* Daleks in Manhattan/Evolution of the Daleks

* The Stolen Earth/Journey's End

* The Waters of Mars

Total episodes: 10 episodes over 5 years

Moffat Era appearances: 

* Victory of the Daleks

* The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang

* The Wedding of River Song

* Asylum of the Daleks

* The Day of the Doctor

* The Time of the Doctor

* Into The Dalek

Total epsiodes: 8 episodes over 5 years. 

So technically Moffat is actually using the Daleks less than RTD. 

Also we don't need to see the Doctor afraid of them, because remember each Doctor has a wildly different personality and a wildly different approach to the Daleks. 9 had anger, 10 had sorrow (""They always survive, while I lose everything""), 11 had bravado and 12 apparently showed utter hatred (with only one encounter we need another episode to know his true reaction). Having the Doctor afraid is something that the writers know they have to use sparingly and when it is used it's to great effect (see: Midnight and Hide). Having the Doctor afraid of the Daleks would be a mistake as it would just get old very quickly. Honestly, the Doctor's initial reaction with a ""Oh Crap"" face is enough.

The history of the Labour party is firmly placed on the left. Labour voters are thoroughly unhappy with the Labour party as it stands, and as it has done so for several years. Blair briefly gave hope to a revival but that support ebbed away as his motives became clear. Now people don't know what the hell they want. Now they vote for the party with the firmest affirmation, regardless of what that affirmation is.

It's not helped by a predominantly ~~Tory~~ conservative (small c) press, but essentially the public go for the people with the clearest message. That's why nearly 4M people voted UKIP; the Tories didn't win because they were the most popular party. The Tories won because it suited powerful people to enable it. Tinfoil hat or not, you have to admit that a tory victory suits Big Business better than the general populace.

A Left Wing Labour can win if they can a) select a clear message and b) select a candidate that represents those views adequately. The last leader to do so was John Smith. The last labour PM to do so was a soft-in-the-head Wilson. His first term was fine, his second extremely questionable, though YMMV.

I'm still very much at odds with your opposition to Corbyn. He will appeal to the grassroots in a way that they've not felt since Smith's party victory in 1992 (Don't forget that a large part of Blair's support post-Smith was still lefties) and so has the potential to win a great deal of support. Labour grassroots will always be suspicious of Blairite candidates (of which there are three) and don't forget that at the Commons level that the majority of MPs are Blairites still, and hardly representative of Joe Average. Blair was very much a man for the time, but I think anyone who wasn't Tory could have won in 1997. Fucking David Icke could have won in 1997. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that grassroots Labour is Blairite. Grassroots Labour will vote for the person that represents Grassroots Labour best, and let me assure you that's not Cooper, Kendall or Burnham. Put another way, if grassroots LibDem honestly felt that Clegg represented them properly then perhaps a few more seats would have remained yellow.

The only thing that's holding back ""leftist"" Labour is the media.",null,0,null,1434844480,null,0,false,0,csdc9dv,null,t3_3aiquj,null,t1_csdc9dv,null,t3_3aiquj,null,null,null,1437222963,null,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3,null

1) I don't really mind all that much, I tend to skip past most links and really only want to read self posts because that's what I come to reddit to see. I don't really know how effective upvoting and downvoting content on reddit is because I always sort by new but I imagine that it must be effective to some degree. I'm not really qualified to say.

2) I wouldn't have done anything with this story, I would have just skipped past it. As for as I'm concerned, the private life of Jenna Coleman, and any actor for that matter, can stay private. It's not that I wouldn't be interested but it's that I don't think that I should be reading gossip about someone's personal life. 

3) I suppose you could. Maybe it would be helpful to see if the rules are indeed in need of revision.

I liked what he offered in midfield, so did Jose (he started in big games over Mikel, Lampard, and Ramires; despite your delusions otherwise), and his ability to play in midfield shield alongside Matic was not replaced; that's indisputable. He was picked ahead of Mikel and Ramires when they were both available, and our only new midfield addition was Fabregas; by no means a similar player.

I genuinely don't understand why you're so incensed by all of this. At no point did I want him back - I was absolutely ecstatic with the fee received - I just want an addition to the squad in the form of a defensive midfielder that is more dynamic than Mikel.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"I recently had this issue with a tenant of mine. Turned out the dippit was drying towels and clothes in his bedroom, while never opening his curtains.  There would have been condensation there around the clock, so it's no wonder it turned into black mould. I cleaned it off and lubed up his window to make it easier to and encourage him to open it. It's been fine since.

As for you, the issue presumably is condensation based, so your best action is to reduce the amount of moisture.  You don't mention any sort of mechanical extraction.  Do you have any? If you don't, ask your landlord to invest.  It will cost him about £500 all-in, so you'll need to be persuasive. If you do, make sure you use it. Passive ventilation is better than nothing, but not very effective, especially if your building's in an area where there isn't much wind or sunlight. 

Something else to consider is how much moisture you introduce to the environment. Are you having long showers, boiling up lots of pasta, or drying things indoors? These activities all introduce lots of moisture, which can have a serious impact on humidity.  Watch what you're doing there.

Some things you could do that might help improve matters is to wipe any moisture off windows or whatever else when it accumulates, change your curtain strategy (basically, have them open when there's light out or when there's soon to be light out, and closed only when it's dark), and maybe invest in a  cheap dehumidifier. They're only around £50 for small ones. Your landlord, if he's worth his salt, shouldn't balk at that.

&gt;He will appeal to the grassroots in a way that they've not felt since Smith's party victory in 1992

What Hodges, along with countless others, has been saying for years is that that kind of sentiment isn't the same as this: 

&gt;A Left Wing Labour can win

""Grassroots Labour"", realistically speaking, encompasses the people that are *active* Labour supporters or likely to become such. That simply isn't a significant enough portion of the electorate to swing an election where it matters- in Southern England. 

Most of the people Labour needs to attract and hold onto next time are either passive, habitual Labour voters *who will not get involved in any grassroots activism* and get most of their political engagement via the media, and soft-c Conservatives- who  make up the majority of the vote that Labour *need* to win back. 

Labour's heartland isn't under any threat from the left significant enough to outweigh how utterly apocalyptic its situation is in Tory-leaning areas- areas that *absolutely, indisputably will not be won* unless Labour can present a credibly centrist candidate. 

The **only** thing that matters for Labour right now is winning the next election. It doesn't matter a damn how happy ideological purity might make the party left feel- that kind of self-destructive vanity's fine in a political system where dissent can be managed, but a two-party FPTP system *forces* a party to tack to the centre if it actually wants to ever win an election. 

It's just thrown away the best chance it's had since 1992 by making the same mistakes as it did back then- it risks doing exactly the same thing *yet again* thanks to the upcoming boundary changes unless it deals with the hard truth that Miliband's Labour lost the economic competence battle that matters in the swing seats it's lost.

A Labour retreat in the direction of its comfort zone, *again*, would be an unmitigated catastrophe. 

&gt;Blair was very much a man for the time, but I think anyone who wasn't Tory could have won in 1997.

The cards were in Labour's hands in 1992, as well. The shy Tory effect is real, and effective- had it not been for Black Wednesday, there's every reason to expect that the Tories would have pulled over the line in 1997 as well. 

Sitting on its hands waiting for another conveniently timed financial collapse to blame on the government isn't a viable electoral strategy to rely on if Labour want to win next time. The boundary changes will strip Labour of a huge number of seats over and above what they've already lost for good in Scotland- if they want to actually *win*, they have to pull back support from people who voted for Blair, but not for Miliband. 

Corbyn represents the wing of the party that's perfectly happy to shove its head in the sand as the world burns around it, repeatedly chanting the same tired mantras to itself- ""Britain is a left-wing country!"", and so on. Labour haven't won on a left-wing platform for pushing forty years, and the country has shifted *right* since then- the media's primarily centre-right leaning, the middle class will only vote for a party that can guarantee them at worst a continuation of the status quo, and Labour's too dependent on winning in the South to risk rocking the boat ever being a viable strategy.",null,0,null,1434853155,null,0,1434853447,0,csdg2m7,null,t3_3aiquj,null,t1_csdg2m7,null,t1_csdc9dv,null,null,null,1437225338,null,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3,null

null,false,aenor,null,null,null,"It's a good idea to think about how the candidates will be attacked - but the author was too kind and ""comradely"" (his word!) in his attempt.

Here's my more brutal attempt at spotting weaknesses and lines of attack. I'll start with the one most easily attacked:

**Andy Burnham**

Scouser. It's unfortunate, but Scousers don't have a good reputation in the rest of Britain. The northerners everyone in the south likes are Geordies, but sadly there arn't any Geordies in this contest.

Also his expenses are horrendous. In the 2008 expenses scandal, Burnham according to the Mail, ""submitted a claim for £16,644 for obtaining and renovating the flat, including £1,845 for a new kitchen. During lengthy negotiations with the fees office, the Labour MP — who later tried to reclaim the cost of a £19.99 bath robe from Ikea — even joked in a letter in December 2005 that he 'might be in line for a divorce' if the expenses were not paid."" It appears that his wife was writing letters to the fees office too (!) 

The fees office relented and finally paid him. But instead of learning from the experience of all these details going public, he's offended again.

In 2012 the expenses office changed the rules so that you couldn't claim on a house you had a mortgage on. Yvette Cooper, Mary Creagh simply shrugged and remained in the (mortgaged) houses they were in without claiming.

Burnham rented his mortgaged flat out (the one the taxpayer paid to renovate) for £1449 per month and moved to rented accommodation, and claimed rent on that to the tune of £17,000.

The worst thing was his spokesman's response to this:

""""Mr Burnham was **forced into this arrangement** by a change in the rules. He has received no public subsidy in respect of his flat and the rent he receives only covers his costs. If parliament changed the rules, he would return to his own flat. Any suggestion that he has made money with the help of the public purse is utterly false.""""

Forced? *Forced?* I doubt any voter would think that (given that Burnham would be earning at least the MP's salary of £65k.

This is not someone who appears to care much about conserving taxpayers hard earned money - which makes it easy to mock anything he says about deficits and cuts (and he's in favour of cuts that fall on *other people* apparently).

Then there's Mid Staffs. No minister of health is responsible for what goes on in any hospital because none can micromanage to that degree - but he was slow to order an enquiry. It will get brought up any time the NHS is in the news.

**Liz Kendall**

She's a single woman in her forties. This is an age when people get married - gay marriage, straight marriage, whatever. *Just get married!* But she hasn't, so what's wrong with her? Too difficult to live with? Too cold? 

She isn't even co-habiting with someone of either sex. If she'd been living with someone for the last fifteen years, she'd get a pass (lots of left wing people do that). If she was a single mother she'd get a pass (lots of single mothers in the country nodding along about what cads men are leaving you holding the baby). If she was divorced she'd get a pass too, lots of people in the same situation.

But she's single in her forties with no children. Not many people like that.  *What's wrong with her?*

Then there's the question of whether she can relate to what people with families go through - it's a cliche but true that no-one really understands this fully till they produce a sprog of their own.

**Jeremy Corbyn**

Lefty looney who sympathises with nut-jobs in the middle east who want to kill us. Enough said. He's a more likeable George Galloway with as much chance of being Prime Minister

**Yvette Cooper**

She suffered from ME in her twenties, and this illness tends to recur. So there's a health question over her.

She has managed to have three children and a career as an MP and minister at the same time though, so it appears she's managing her illness. But a bit of Googling reveals that Ed Balls does all the cooking and cleaning in that household. According to Balls, Yvette is a bit ""lastminute.com"" while he's the organised one! (He'd make a great First Dude, but voters might worry he was making other decisions too). 

******

Of all these problems, Yvette's are the easiest to get round. There are literally *millions* of women in the country who are struggling with illness but trying to hold it together and keep working and looking after their families. If she manages to always put forward a competent face, she'll get a lot of points from women admiring how she's doing it.",null,0,null,1434855506,null,0,1434856114,0,csdh3kd,null,t3_3ajxyn,null,t1_csdh3kd,null,t3_3ajxyn,null,null,null,1437225966,null,6,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,6,null

Pogba may be a pipe dream but to say that they're just throwing money at Englishmen is a bit harsh, especially if it means they'll end with Wilshere as a fourth option or Delph. Surely either of them can be as serviceable as someone like Jovetic or Fernando was this season (different positions, I understand, but disappointing performances). 

There aren't too many world class players available - now, if ever. Maybe ""serviceable"" is the wrong word, because I sure as hell believe guys like Wilshere or Delph are much more than serviceable and would be wonderful to have as rotational players, if not more. It's not going to put City in a position to win the Champions League, I agree, but neither of those options would make them worse than they currently are. It's going to be extremely hard to get to a RM or Barca level. I definitely agree we can't just hope players pass up other opportunities. Unfortunately, I also believe the only way to do that at the moment is to give up the outrageous money that people think City shouldn't give.

They've known all along they were going to shuck at least that much out.  They are trying to make Liverpool feel like they are ripping us off when in reality we thought Sterling could go for 60 or 70 mil according to peligrinis interview earlier this year. 

Sterling may be seen as a risk but in reality we know he had the talent.  The risk is all on our side as to how well we develop him once he's here.  If we make the right moves and train him right there is no doubt he will be world class. 

We are paying 50 million for possibly the best English player over the next decade.  50 million for 10 years of world class play is not bad.  

Pogba is a whole different ordeal that I don't understand.  Nobody really does because nobody actually knows what pogba wants, only pogba does.  

As far as the window being tragic so far.  It hasn't even begun.  Id be encouraged by the fact we are willing to spend a lot on Sterling because that means we are starting off the window with serious intention.  

The plans are all there, we just don't know them in their entirety yet.  Txiki has been feeling out players for the past 9 months.  They know what they are doing.

null,false,whistdrive,null,null,null,"&gt;No they were white people's community leaders at the time. That's why they got away with it. 

The Catholic clergy aren't white people's community leaders in the sense that a grooming gangs phenomenon amongst whites, Catholic and non-Catholic, isn't something they know about and discuss and try to resolve internally. It wasn't the imams committing the abuse; rather, they weren't reporting members of their community. It's a false analogy.

If the likes of the Muslim Council of Britain wants to call it a 'racist myth' perpetrated by violent BNP racists then it can't be said that if the police asked the community 'is investigating this racist?' like you wanted they'dve definitely got a 'no' in reply. 'These crimes were widely discussed between Muslim leaders who, ""talked in Mosques, but not to the police"" while they were privately ""trying to resolve the problem"".' I wonder why they did such a shitty job of resolving it?

There's a BBC debate video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7JmVwMNq4c. White guy says that the grooming gang members have been mostly of Kashmiri Pakistani origin. Then the Asian journalist interrupts to call him a *liar*. In *2014*. And to say that whites commit the most abuse by the numbers. Well of course they do, they're 90% of the population. It's a point so stupid I cannot fathom how she could utter it, let alone how it could be applauded--it's just denial. She could've brought some balance instead of lashing out.

&gt;I have faced racism over and over again. Both overt and unconscious. Anti-Muslim and Anti-Asian bigotry exists. 

I never said there isn't racism, and getting abused like that would make me really bitter too.

But accusations of racism have been weaponised, and that just plays into racists' hands, because then they can say that 'racism' is a bullshit scare-word. The groomers would pull kids away from their parents by saying that their parents were racist and just didn't understand. Luftur Rahman got away with his corruption for so long partly because he called anyone who opposed him 'racist'. A Guardian columnist went to bat for him (http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/30/lutfur-rahman-tower-hamlets-mayor-smear-campaign).

Asian abusers of whites and of Asians will carry on as long as they know the police won't do anything. If they see someone even beginning to talk about *them* being shouted down on TV, if they know the MCB can call it a 'racist myth', if they know there's a lot out there (the identity politics branch of the left-wing; I definitely identify with this: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/11/mainstream-left-silencing-sympathetic-voices) ready to angrily suppress *all* discussion with accusations of racism, they can easily have the perception that those accusations will keep the police off their backs. The abusers' perception of the police and justice system counts:

http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/leader-of-rochdale-sex-grooming-gang-689929

&gt;He also repeatedly accused the judge, the jury, and the police of being part of a racist conspiracy against Muslims.

&gt;All the defendants were Asian and all the five young victims who gave evidence during the trial were white.

&gt;""It's all white lies,"" he said.

&gt;But it can now be revealed he repeatedly raped an Asian girl over many years.

Racism isn't a one-way street either:

http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/leader-of-rochdale-sex-grooming-gang-689929

&gt;'We are a civilised society. We are the supreme race, not these white b******s (pointing to police officers in court)'

http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/oxford-child-sex-grooming-gang-1889867

&gt;On one occasion Umar Razaq tried to pull the clothes off one of the 13-year-olds.

&gt;When she resisted he pulled her hair and called her a ‘white bitch’.

http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/14/oxford-gang-guilty-grooming-girls

&gt;The Guardian has been told by one victim, known as Girl C, in an interview after she gave her evidence, that the men exclusively wanted white girls to abuse.

Whites are called white when they commit racist offenses so there's no reason others shouldn't get their ethnicity named when they do it.

Illara would be an awesome signing. But I think it all depends on whether Rodgers is willing enough to spend money on a player like him - cause, based off last season, he seemed to hate using a true DM (though I do admit we were short in depth for DM). He would be a great signing, though.

Don't know how to feel about Bacca. Just gut feeling says he won't work out if we do get him. That said, he has all the qualities needed to be successful in our system. Just wish there were more options to choose from to buy strikers - the only possible option, in terms of both money and quality, seems to be Bacca right now. 

Volland is unrealistic right now, Aubameyang too. Higuain doesnt look possible either, while I don't think targetmen like Llorente or Benteke would be good for us.

I would love some south American flair.
