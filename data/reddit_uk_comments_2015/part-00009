My understanding is that NFL is a highly tactical sport, and you need to invest some time to begin to understand the plays and tactics. My personal barrier to putting the effort in, lies in the sheer amount of time that a single game takes, and the short amount of actual game play in that time. I have tried watching the Superbowl with friends a few times, but we always ended up getting a bit bored within the first couple of hours and heading to a pub.

Ice Hockey is a great sport, but I struggle to cope with the incredible volume of flashing lights, music and everything else that America/Canada seems to feel is necessary for a sporting event. For comparison, I prefer ice hockey at the Winter Olympics where it's stripped down and more focused on the sport.

I find baseball very dull, like cricket. I've attended one cricket match, I assume baseball is the same, as in most people seem to be there to get drunk, whilst half-heartedly watching sport in the sun.

Nascar seems so limited. I kinda assume it's also there to get drunk at, whilst watching the occasional bit of drama.

""Cunt"", on the other hand (...and if you thought that, you have a dirty mind...), is absolutely definitely an ancient English word. For a start, it's blatantly Germanic (compare Old Norse ""kunta"", Middle Low German ""kunte"", etc), and was present in Middle English.

Meanwhile ""bum"" is assuredly NOT of ""unknown origin"" - it is almost certainly an onomatopœic word, comparable with various other ""round-sounding"" words. Again, it was present in Middle English, and is quite likely older than that. At least ""twat"" is of unknown origin and a relatively recent word, probably from ~C16th.

If the NFL want a London team they can find space for a new stadium, build it, pay for it and take on all the risk themselves.

Obviously a hung parliament is possible and that seems to be what all the parties are orienting themselves towards - but a small outright majority from either main party is still on the table.

6-12 months ago it was looking pretty rosy for Ed Miliband, but with the parties collapse in Scotland, general voter dislike for Miliband in England and his relative inexperience vs Cameron (i.e. gaff prone) it's hard to call. A serious implosion of the NHS could play into Labours hands, and if Jim Murphy can regain at least *some* of the ground they lost in Scotland then they could be in with a shot. A major conservative scandal or two might seal the deal for them as well. The more the economy improves, ironically the more voters will want a labour government (since I think deep down we all know that even when austerity ends, things like the public sector pain restraints aren't going to be lifted because the reason is ideological as much as it is financial). 

Personally my guess is the opposite is more likely... UKIP hurt the conservatives proportionally less than was expected (taking a relatively equal share from both Labour and the Conservatives instead). Also, the demise of the Lib Dems benefits Labour less than was expected and benefits the Tories more (there are several key LD:Tory marginal seats).  The NHS issues over winter fail to gain traction in May when the situation calms.

Nowhere in a major UK city (particularly one with good digital infrastructure like Cambridge!) should you be getting speeds slower than 5mbps down. 15mbps is more common... sounds like there is actually a problem here. I don't think 4G is the solution either... 

* Make sure you aren't on a package that limits you to what you're getting. 

* I don't think rushing out and buying 4G internet is the solution to your problems - you certainly won't get speeds much faster than what you are already getting. 0.5-1 mpbs is probably roughly what you'll get on 4G and its incredibly expensive. It's also very dependent on getting signal which is by no means widespread yet. 

* If that doesn't work phone the ISP. They are required to advertise in advance the sort of speeds you are likely to get. I doubt very much you were advertised speeds of just 0.5mbps... its more likely you have a problem somewhere.

* Sometimes when you have a line problem (either between your router and the exchange, or at the exchange) the software that handles the connection (at the ISPs end) automatically reduces speed to stabilize the connection.  

Basically phone the ISP and ask them about it. I can tell you that the last time my internet was 0.5mpbs was around 2003... the UK has excellent broadband and fibreoptic infrastructure and average speeds are usually between 5 and 15mbps. If this doesn't work think about swapping from telephone based internet to a fibreoptic service (these are much faster but more expensive). BT's fibreoptic is sold as ""Infinity"" and the cable network fibreoptic service is provided by Virginmedia. These usually offer speeds closer to 50-100mbps.

null,false,lobbmaster,null,null,null,"Yes we could have signed another striker than Balotelli, OR we could have played with different tactics from August to December.. During that period is the worst formations and tactics I've seen from a Liverpool-side in many years compared to the squad available to the manager, yes worse than Hodgson. 

Players that played good and contributed going forward got benched the next 2-4 games, players that played bad in that same game but are favourites of Rodgers started the next 2-4 games.

Our main tactic for 4 months was to keep posession infront of our own goalie, while playing with a lone striker, and that lone striker being either Balotelli that has never played as a lone striker and don't like to get into the box, or Lambert that is very slow.. 

We have a squad consisting of players like Can, Markovic, Lallana, Balotelli, Coutinho - all players that like to bring the ball forward, have abilities to create goal scoring chances etc - yet many of them have been benched alot, specially against Basel when we HAD to win.. When we started Lucas, Henderson, Allen, Gerrard, Sterling, Lambert.. that is one immobile and non-dangerous team if I ever saw one. 

In several games (4-6?) we have had the lead at 60-80 minutes and Rodgers have tried to close the game out by parking the bus.. with our defense.. at every single attempt at this the other team have scored before full time.. 

Almost EVERY time the opposition has a corner we have 11 players in our box.. not ONE player ready to start a counter-attack, even against teams like Burnley or Leicester.. 

I could probably come up with over 20 other reasons like this.. 

Edit: Forgot to mention things like Lucas being dropped away to United after having started 3 games where we conceded 1 goal in total, 100% illogical decision that backfired directly.

&gt; I know; it's weird. Most people are used to religion only working if death is threatened; why else would one want to follow a bunch of restrictive rules if there isn't any danger that you'll be cut to pieces? Apparently, Christianity uses this whole ""salvation"" thing to attract people - the carrot instead of the stick. So, if I get things right, I can sin and blaspheme all I want - swearing, doing drugs, and fornicating - and no one will murder me.
&gt;
 SarahK informed me that this was incorrect, as she would murder me, but she herself would be sinning. So, not only is murder in support of Christianity not encouraged, it itself is a sin. This wasn't always well known, though, and some people long long ago murdered people for not being Christians. That causes problems today, as people will say, ""While other religions murder people now, some people a hundred million years ago murdered people in the name of Christianity, so Christianity is just the same.""
&gt;
 And you might respond, ""But that was very long ago and went against the principles of Christianity and thus is condemned.""
&gt;
 And the person will rebut, ""Yes, but I'm a moral retard who equivocates everything. As far as I'm concerned, A is the same as Z.""

If you've got a lazy setup (chuck money in monthly, leave and ignore) then the usability isn't really costing you much in time.

For a comparison, at ~30k, HL would cost about £50 a year more. If you want to pay £50 for a shiny website (this number will grow each year, too) then go for it, but that's part of what the money goes to (as well as newsletters and the like).

&gt; I have been advised to stick to vanguard and keep index fund investments in specific sectors under 10%, would everyone agree with this statement? 

That seems pretty sensible.

&gt; Also your FAQ section is pretty damn good, though my wallet disliked the book purchases!

Yay for reading the FAQ!

If the books cost £100, then if you save 0.3% on fees because you've gone with Vanguard rather than a more expensive actively managed fund, they'll pay for themselves in a year. With a 10 year horizon, starting with 27k and saving 500/mo, then you just need to boost your investment return from 4% to 4.031% for it to pay off (including the opportunity cost of not investing the £100 straight away).

I think the 24-year-old Henderson is the ideal captain for Liverpool. He is young and ambitious. He has been the captain for the England U21 squad. He isn't flashy and he has yet to possess a sort of talismanic quality that Gerrard has but Henderson embodies a strong, down-to-earth, working-class ethic that, I think, we have all grown to appreciate. And there is little controversy that surrounds Henderson, he hardly says anything controversial, he is almost boring in that respect but I think that sort of steady personality is what will endear him to supporters and the city of Liverpool as well.

And again, he is only 24-years-old and he still has a few more years to grow into his full potential. Not that he is required to be a steady source of goals but I think that he will also develop into a player who can provide a decent amount of goals as well.

And to think that Henderson was regularly criticised for not being 'good enough.' I know evaluating players and their potential is quite difficult but Henderson should remind us that sometimes we need to try our best to avoid the knee-jerk reaction and think of the long-term and not the short term.

Actually - it is a widely held view by pretty much everybody who understands the subject.

There's nothing substantially different about dutch people - dutch visitors don't cycle in the UK (dutch people moving to the UK cycle less than natives as the UK facilities are so poor), while immigrants to the netherlands cycle a lot when they move there.

There's nothing unique about the dutch geography - denmark, belgium, and much of  england are as flat as holland (but without the wind).

There's nothing unique about dutch weather, it's not as favorable as british weather, and countries both hotter &amp; colder, flatter &amp; hillier still get the same benefits from installing the high quality provision you see in the netherlands.

Everyone was well insured against it and charge backs are easy to make so there was little perceived benefit to chip and pin. The USA uses credit cards a lot more than Europe, there are loads of benefits of swiping, for example taxis can just impression the card they don't need to have an internet connection. You go into a Starbucks in the USA, they take your card, swipe it and hand it back, no signing, they're just insured against all fraud so don't care. 

Now CC fraud in the UK is virtually zero and CC fraud in the US has increased particularly online so they're planning on bringing it in.  

NFC is entirely different it doesn't require any infrastructure changes you just add it on to cards and people get it when they want if they want it at all, chip and pin limits the way CCs can be used and to be worth the effort you have to stop swiping from working. 

Also before we start feeling all brilliant about ourselves for having chip and pin remember that France had it for something like 20 years before we did.... We weren't exactly trail blazers.

The Saudis could restrict supply right now and push the price back up but they won't for two reasons:

1. The lower the price goes the more chance there is of US shale companies pulling out of the now non profitable sites.  

2. If they restrict supply they may lose some of their market share to the US with the oil importing countries they supply. 

FTR the US is knocking out nearly the same rate of Barrels per day as the Saudi's are with shale oil which is pretty incredible to be honest.

Last season it was Fabregas, at various times it's been Pique, especially since Puyol retired and his form dipped. Alex Song got a lot of heat there, Busquets catches it a lot as well because the defending behind him is poor. 

The chat I've seen from a lot of Barca supporters is that Suarez is being blamed for a lot of their struggles largely because they feel the money that was spent on him should have been invested elsewhere. Honestly, they're right. Masch is now playing at CB in some of their games, once Alves and Montoya leave their sole RB will be Douglas, Rakitic has replaced Fabregas, there's no holding mid apart from Busquets and Messi hates the manager. They've now got elections coming up at the end of the year, the sporting director has been sacked and Puyol has wisely stepped away from it all. They're an absolute mess at the moment. 

Jettisoning good players during tough times is a Barcelona mainstay so all I would say is that it's not beyond the realm of possibility that Suarez could leave.

Buy a cheap ADSL connection if you can. There are some deals out there which roll on monthly and can be cancelled at any time, are relatively cheap to get installed and don't involve changing anything other than plugging in a pre-supplied router into your phone socket and mains.

Failing that, ask around neighbours. They may be willing to let you piggy back off their WiFi for a few quid a month.

If you want a cheap option, you can get a mobile/wifi bridge off amazon for about £20 and use GiffGaff's service with it. That's got the lowest up front cost but the latency is horrible.

Obviously many people would say a nurse - but a web developer is equally important as if websites were so awful that online shopping was impossible then we would lose out, we are only able to communicate like this because of web developers.

Even the oft-demonised bankers are useful as they allow unused resources to be utilised elsewhere while managing the risk of such an enterprise ultimately allowing far more to get done than in societies without an advanced finance system and making everyone better off.

That's not to say the current system is perfect - I really dislike how some people can simply live off of the work of others ('rentier capitalism' in the sense of Ricardo and Smith) and the fact that some can accrue so much wealth that it can distort the market - even Adam Smith lamented that: 
&gt;A great stock, though with small profits, generally increases faster than a small stock with great profits. Money, says the proverb, makes money. When you have a little, it is often easier to get more. The great difficulty is to get that little.

This can make it hard for competition to survive even with regulations and when you have fewer agents in the market making decisions with vast amounts of wealth the idea that the law of large numbers will result in efficiency begins to seem tenuous.

I think we have to find a way to democratise the ownership of assets such as stocks and bonds even the membership of the more sophisticated asset management schemes like hedge funds. This would allow the average person to realise the power of our modern financial system and what it can do for them. Also it seems the right thing to do in a democratic society just as democratising the ownership of homes was.

Tesco buys bread from a supplier for £1.00 and sells it for £1.20 making a 20p profit.

Next day, everyone else is selling bread for £0.80. Tesco have to sell bread for £0.80 to actually shift their stock. Tesco lose 20p per loaf then.

Tesco then says they'll only pay 60p for the next batch of loaves from the supplier. Supplier is down 40p a loaf.

The manufacturer and Tesco cut costs where possible to maintain sales (cash flow).

Quality declines, people get replaced with machines (not an overly bad thing TBH) and some companies disappear after saying ""no we can't sell loaves to you for 60p as it costs us 62p to make them"".

The whole financial system relies on increasing value (inflation) to avoid these scenarios as they usually cascade pretty rapidly and entire supply chains get destroyed.

null,false,BaBaFiCo,null,null,null,"If you have a goatee, white socks with khaki shorts and a windbreaker on we'll spot you a mile off. Shorts seem to be hugely popular with American tourists but unless it is that one hot day in July they're much less common here. Casual wear you'll fit in more wearing a nice pair of jeans or coloured chinos with a polo shirt or casual shirt. If you're a woman the same probably still applies. 

As others have said, don't make a habit of loudly comparing everything back home to here, unless someone else has already started that conversation. Also we tend to be a lot more self depreciating and modest compared to our American cousins. We don't tend to boast about anything new or exciting, especially not with strangers. You'll find a lot of people will tell you about their lives and moan about it. We're not all miserable it's just not normal to be proud. Our adjectives are a little different too. ""It's alright"" is much less positive here than in the US and ""quite good"" means its just above average, not great. 

Religion isn't as important here as it is in the US and you'll probably find most people are non-practicing Christians (probably Anglican Church but no one really knows), agnostic or atheist. The service will probably have a lot of religious aspects but it's more for show and tradition than belief. Don't expect to get anyone involved in a discussion on Christianity and bringing up any other religion will only help you find Uncle Racist who wants to tell you how we should ""deal with all the foreigners"". 

The wedding dress code will almost certainly be suits and cocktail dresses. You can't go wrong with just a classic black suit, white shirt and coloured tie but don't be afraid of showing a bit of colour, a lot of younger people do these days. Blue suits are quite the rage at the minute. A lot of guests change after the service and wedding breakfast (if they're having one) for the evening reception. That'll be just a nice shirt and trousers, no tie. I'm guessing the bar is buy your own unless they've said otherwise. I know free bar is popular in America but it's just not the done thing here particularly. There might be a "" bit of money"" behind the bar which might mean your first drink or two is free, but they'll tell you that. Tipping the bar staff isn't a thing (though I'm sure they wouldn't say no!) but if you're feeling generous then offer ""and get yourself one"". They'll usually bill you for a drink and have it when their shift is finished as many can't drink on the job. We usually buy drinks in rounds. Some Americans are used to this, some aren't. So basically expect to be offered a drink by someone sitting at your table or stood talking with you. Feel free to accept and you don't need to offer them money in return. The expectation is that at some point in the evening you will offer the same. Brits have an inbuilt sense of when it is "" their round"" so they'll know when to offer again as everyone else has bought a round since they last did. You might be exempt from buying a round since you're foreign but if you want to fit in: if the person who bought the first round offers again, interject with ""no, no, it's my round, I'm getting this one"". You'll then be included in the rota. Also don't expect everyone to pay equally since some drinks are more than others and don't order anything over £5/6 when asked otherwise it'll look like you're taking the piss. The average pint down there is £3.50 so expect to pay that multiplied by the number of people for a round (a little more for ladies drinks).

Not so much tricked as naive and stupidly tried to do the right thing because he hadn't done anything wrong.

&gt;  He did the right thing, would a lawyer instruct him to say ""no comment""?

Yes! If he hadn't spoken to the police the case would have been dropped. It's only because he told the truth, that she'd consented to sex, that he was able to be successfully prosecuted for rape. If he'd have said nothing he'd have avoided all of this but when you are innocent you want to *prove* that you are innocent and so end up saying things that ""can and will be used against you"".

&gt; I doubt anything will come of the website being in ""contempt of court"" or anything else, but I still find it pretty sickening all round.

If he'd have raped her I would have expected that on conviction he'd have shut up about this and wanted it all to go away as soon as possible. It's only because he didn't that he can't let it go.

&gt; Whatever your thoughts on the case, it is a website by a convicted rapist showing tweets of their victim and a video of them. It is humiliating in the extreme.

Much as I support the idea of victims of rape being protected from harassment by their attackers, it is also painfully obvious to anyone who reads the case reports that there is no way it is possible to conclude that there is no reasonable doubt in the case of his conviction. With that in mind if he believes he is innocent (and who wouldn't in his shoes?) then he needs to retain the right to say so.

&gt; Good luck to him and Oldham. Things are bad now, I wonder what will happen if he ever plays?

Hopefully it doesn't go any further than crowd chants.

3) Killing someone who's laughing at you will stop that particular person. To get everyone to stop laughing at you you'd have to kill everyone. Good luck with that, morons.  
  
4) Killing someone because they've upset you reveals your weak spot. So now we know which button to press. And we also get a good laugh at your expense.  
  
5) Don't like humour aimed at your favourite religious person? My that's a shame. Say, do you know the one about Mohammed and the goat ...?  

6) You don't resist a bunch of humourless cunts by becoming serious. You do it by laughing at them.

I don't have a problem with ""the dole"". In fact I don't expect everyone to have a job. There have been so many advances in automation that we require less people to do work now and spend a lot of time making sure people don't need to work. Because we're obsessed with ""job stats"" as a measure of success for a society, this is turned into a big issue politically but we need to expect that less people are required to run things. In fact many jobs are created to artificially provide work for people.

Unfortunately these are usually highly skilled.

For reference, I gladly pay my £2400 a month in tax and NI as I've stated before to support others, their healthcare and hell I live next to a massive council estate and help people with their IT problems and fix their cars for nothing.

What are the costs of spooks looking at our emails? 

I mean there is the difficulty of ensuring they don't abuse the information they find - but many jobs deal with sensitive data and have managed fine. 

Then there is the monetary cost - but I presume the Government has analysed this and found it to be worth the investment. 

Finally there is the cost to our liberty - would I have to use my email differently if I knew GCHQ were spying on it? For me, at least, the answer is no.

Therefore logically it follows that if it can prevent any terrorist acts then it is a worthwhile policy.

I somewhat doubt it will prevent terrorist acts as I doubt people would email their plots to one another and I doubt the technical side as to whether blanket surveillance of email contents would even be feasible as the vast amounts of data would mean one would have to resort to data mining algorithms which are rather crude.

But I don't really think it'd effect me either way - so I think people do tend to overreact to surveillance.

Yes. You must have good credit to be on the mortgage and you must have proof of stable income showing that you can afford it. 

If you jointly owned it with your dad, and he died, then his share would pass to you and your sister (subject to appropriate legal arrangements over the separation, will, etc.) in that case you would own a large share and your sister a smaller share.

This is a difficult matter with huge consequences if you get the planning wrong. I'd suggest getting a financial adviser and specifically putting these questions  to him, as well as making sure that there are no hidden traps.

My personal experience is that one half of a relationship 
(particularly a fairly new one) living rent free can end up causing issues. Personally, I think that she should pay at least something towards the mortgage in the form of rent (doesn't have to be half.. maybe something slightly less than market rate). 

The other point to make from a financial point of view is that if her boyfriend is able to afford the mortgage payments on his own then they could make use of the additional rent/savings as overpayments instead of putting it into a savings account - typically the interest on the mortgage will be more than any interest you might earn in a savings account so it actually saves money to overpay the mortgage rather than save the money.

If it were me in her situation I would ask to pay something towards the mortgage as rent... it would give her some feeling of ownership of the house and independence - having a simple tenancy agreement (there are plenty available online.. just adjust the wording) is a good idea.

The [""degree of importance, with the aim of determining what action of life is best to do or live (Deontology), or to describe the significance of different actions""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_%28ethics%29).  
Something can have high ethical value and low monetary value because the means by which something's price is determined is not the same mechanism that determines whether that something is considered ethically desirable.  
  
  
&gt; I believe the two are the same.  
  
  
They are related, but not equivalent.  
  
  
&gt; Monetary value is value  
  
    
Ethical and monetary value are both types of value (they share some things in common), but aren't equivalent (they don't share everything in common).  
""Value"" is a superset of all kinds of related concepts: Monetary values, ethical values, data type values, ...  
  
  
&gt; the market reflects the value we place on things and money  
  
To some extent. The worldwide economy (or even just the national economy) isn't just a mirror of what we think is valuable (in a general sense), it's also a place where people bet on whether stocks will go down or up, where people deliberately store or release stock in order to generate a certain effect (deBeers, OPEC), and there are countless other similar activities related to the market all of which go to make up the final value of a wage. So sure, the regard that something is held in may determine the financial value that's assigned to it, but many other factors besides will also go towards affecting that value.  
  
  
&gt; If people think something is good but aren't willing to pay for it - then you have to wonder how much they really think it is good?

No, although I am looking around to change, I think I'll be crossing some of the breakeven points this year.

&gt; I can work out the costs now before investing, with iWeb, it seems you need to create an account first which is a shame.

It's not obvious, but I think this is what you want. There's a £5/trade fee, and then fund charges, which you need to dig out from here:

http://www.iweb-sharedealing.co.uk/market-information/Market-Information-Service.asp

Specifically here:

https://halifaxiweb.digitallook.com/funds

For example, the Vanguard LS 80% ACC https://halifaxiweb.digitallook.com/security.cgi?username=&amp;ac=&amp;csi=2569225&amp;record_search=1&amp;search_phrase=vanguard

Then you can see the charges on the right, and you also want to check out the KIID (key investor information document) which has various bits of information you need to know, like any upfront charges (in this case, 0.1% upfront, 0.24% annual). Always check this document before investing :) 


&gt; My only debt is a student loan which I'm letting my paycheques eat up as the interest gained on investments will be more valuable. Though it still sucks seeing the interest add up! 

Grand. If your student debt is one of the older types (by that I mean you didn't graduate in 2014 / aren't still at uni, and graduated after 1998 [I think it's 1998]) then you're paying 1.5% which means that your debt is shrinking in real terms (lower than inflation). It's also guaranteed to track the lower of two measures, inflation and the BoE base rate + 1%. You can beat this in a standard account, you should definitely be beating this in the long term with investing!

&gt; I'll keep accessible cash in some high interest current accounts, probably about £10k

Great, that'll smooth over various bumps in life.

null,false,doom_halo,null,null,null,"Honestly, I would say that it's not worth the hassle of doing this. There are a number of very tricky complications that could come into it, I can only tell you how tricky my situation is now.
My Mum passed away in 2010. Before she died, her and my Dad were joint tenants on the property, which means that no share of the property is apportioned, and if one person dies, the property is left to the other person. However, she notified my Dad of a change to tenants in common, which apportioned the property 50% each way. This is because in the first case, you cannot leave property to anyone else other than the other property owner. This was so that she could leave her share in trust for my me and my sister. This was done and has a couple of consequences - my Dad has the ability to live in the property for however long he goes on for, and also, he cannot sell the property without both mine and my sister's written permission.
Move a few years down the line, and my Dad has met someone else (who me and my sister are both on good terms with). I'm just about to graduate, and my sister still has a few years left at University. His new partner still has a (small) mortgage, and after my sister graduates they're thinking of buying a property together. This becomes very complicated, as the terms of my mum's will only allows him to do so if my sister and I are named on the property. If they therefore wanted to take out a small mortgage on the property they are seeking to buy, there could possibly be implications in that way on me and my sister.

So, there's a few things you should think about. 

a) If your dad meets someone else, and she moves into the property, he has every right to say in his will that she can continue to live there after his death, if he predeceases her - or at least, she could continue to do so until it was taken to court. 

b) How would you divide the house if you were to go on the mortgage right now? You say you're planning to buy your mum out of it - but who is fronting the cash to do so? Or are you and your father planning to take out another mortgage divided equally?

c) You mention that it's possible your Dad loses his job, but equally have you thought about your own situation? 

d) Have you thought about the implications of wanting to buy your own property later down the line? Some of the government house schemes are only for first time buyers, and if you have a share on a property like this, it might impact your situation wrt the current schemes and any future ones. 

e) Normally with a mortgage you have some kind of insurance that pays it off if someone who is a payee dies on it. This was certainly what happened when my mum passed away. You need to find out about this though.
Basically there are many many complications you've not thought about, and you need to see a solicitor, no matter how expensive. You said you're in your early twenties, and that suggests to me that you might change your mind later on about paying into this - if you need a mortgage of your own when you meet someone and want to buy a house, this could prove to be a big financial barrier to that, no matter how you feel about it now.",null,0,null,1420717810,null,0,false,0,cniadnu,null,t3_2rqckt,null,t1_cniadnu,null,t3_2rqckt,null,null,null,1424993831,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

Yes, but these tend to be subject to slightly better oversight than the intelligence services.

""Government"" and ""analysis"" are two words that are strangers to each other.

&gt; Finally there is the cost to our liberty - would I have to use my email differently if I knew GCHQ were spying on it? For me, at least, the answer is no.

What if you're a journalist investigating abuse of RIPA? The problem is that although the intelligence services are ostensibly in the service of the state, lately they have been seen mainly to be serving the themselves and attempting to avoid the kind of oversight required to make this sort of thing seem democratic. Can't say that makes me feel terribly happy about what they're doing.

&gt;There's a £5/trade fee, and then fund charges, which you need to dig out 

I'm trying to digest all the information, this basically means, any time I choose a fund, it will cost £5 for me to put any money into it?  Is this the case for adding more cash to a fund you already have a stake in?

Yup, my total student debt is alarmingly large at 25k or so but it is indeed an older style loan, all money I have in various accounts is beating 1.5%

Yes I invest in my company pension scheme as its matched up to 6%, so I max that out.  I'm not yet a higher rate tax payer but I have looked a little at SIPP's for future.

 [**Designated Player Rule**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated%20Player%20Rule): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __Designated Player Rule__, nicknamed __the Beckham Rule__,  was adopted as part of the [salary cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap) regulations of [Major League Soccer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer) for the 2007 season. The rule allows each MLS franchise to sign players that would be considered outside of the team's salary cap (either by offering the player higher wages or by paying a transfer fee for the player), allowing MLS teams to compete for star players in the international soccer market.

&gt;The rule is informally named after soccer star [David Beckham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham), in anticipation of MLS teams signing lucrative deals with internationally recognized players of Beckham's caliber.   Beckham was the first player signed under this rule, signing a five-year contract with the [Los Angeles Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Galaxy) with guaranteed annual salary of $6.5 million.

It's 979/999 according to Experian/Credit Expert:

&gt; The number of credit accounts you are using is low

&gt; You have no recent searches on your credit report

&gt; The balance of your unsecured lending indicates a lower risk

&gt; The age of your accounts indicates lenders are likely to view you as lower risk

I'm kind of surprised it's that high, to be honest. 

&gt; what sort of credit agreements do you have at the moment? 

I have two overdrafts and I previously had a store card that I applied for by accident. Paid that off immediately but left it open and they cancelled it after about a year of me not using it. 

&gt; My suggestion would be to apply for the Santander card (one application won't really impair your creditworthiness). 

I have an account with Santander already, and they tell me whenever I go in to a branch that I'm eligible for a credit card, which is why I thought this would be a good one. Looking at it now, though, it's probably not that great - I don't have a car, don't travel often by train and don't spend much in department stores. Realistically I'd be getting 1% on supermarkets (probably around £1-2 a month) and the very rare train journey home (£1.20 every couple of months). That's not going to take me far over the £2/month fee. 

I'll think about applying for one of those other two you linked. Thanks for your help.

Llandudno would be an excellent place to stay, given that the start and end of one stage takes place there. It's also fairly convenient for Snowdonia's mountains and walks etc. 

Further south I'd suggest perhaps staying in Welshpool or Bala. I have no specific info on these places nor their accommodation offerings. I would say though when choosing a place, to check drive times to where you want to go. Wales is a mountainous country and there are no straight roads from A to B. 

Here's some info from the Daily Post (the north's regional newspaper) on [last year's rally](http://www.dailypost.co.uk/all-about/wales-rally-gb). There may be something there. 

I'd also recommend searching for UK rally forums for people with interest.

---
&gt;
&gt;After his regeneration following the events on Androzani Major and Minor (TV: *The Caves of Androzani*), the new Doctor starts behaving erratically. Peri is still shocked by the Doctor's change and has him look at his reflection in her compact mirror. The Doctor is happy with his new features and decides that he must change out of his predecessor's clothing and find a new outfit fitting his new persona. He goes to the wardrobe and starts looking for a new outfit, finding a glaring, mismatched, brightly coloured coat, to which he immediately takes a shine. Peri tells him that he could not possibly go outside wearing such an awful garb, to which the Doctor takes offence.
&gt;The two twins, Romulus and Remus Sylvest, receive a visitation from a mysterious old man called Professor Edgeworth. They question how he managed to get inside their house; he tells them he will return when their father is there, then proceeds to take control of their minds, and the trio disappear. They arrive on a spacecraft in deep space. Edgeworth then communicates with his superior, a slug-like creature called Mestor, who instructs Edgeworth to take the twins to Titan III.

It isn't an either/or matter though. He can think he deserves to be innocent whilst also *actually being innocent*.

&gt; This is what a lot of people are falling for, they think... ""well it wasn't rape rape was it?"". 

It *wasn't* real rape if she gave meaningful consent as he claims and she claims not to remember. On that basis a conviction is unsound. It has nothing to do with whether he attacked her with a knife in a dark alley being ""real"" rape or not. The only thing that matters is consent.

&gt; If he is genuinely completely innocent he will still be thought badly of even if it is purely for his beaviour that night and since. 

Even if he'd have behaved exactly as you think he should have there would still be people that would think badly of him regardless of whether he was found innocent or not. But assuming he is innocent (as I do based on the evidence presented in the court reports), why should he say anything about the woman responsible for him being in prison for two and a half years and losing his contract with Sheffield United when it is her who is responsible for his suffering?

&gt; It looks like he is being bankrolled by his girlfriend's rich Dad, I wonder what part he is playing in all this.

The only butchers and greengrocers I know of now are good ones that go the extra mile for example. Their prices and quality beat supermarkets every time too.

The problem I find is that years ago if you wanted a coffee or a sandwich and were passing through somewhere, you went to a local one. Some were good, some were bad. Now people see a brand they have heard of and go there. Hence a brilliant little cafe will get overlooked for a Starbucks or a mediocre pre-packed sandwich from somewhere like Tesco. 

It is why I haven't been too concerned with the amount of pubs closing. I know of none, not a single one springs to mind, in my city that was an excellent pub and has closed due to supermarket booze or the smoking ban. If anything, more good ones have opened. The ones that have closed are the ones with a miserable barman, a clique of hardened drinkers who scowl at any non-locals, and don't do food or decent beer.

Hopefully some happy medium will sort itself out so that the only independent cafes, pubs and shops are the decent ones, they continue to thrive, and if not the supermarkets are there as a backup.

If dethroned they'd get nothing they didn't own privately and they'd become a normal citizen. The crown estate would no longer be theirs. 

The fact that *they wouldn't even want to take it* is by the by.
This ""complex relationship"" you talk about is not complex at all, the crown estate website makes it quiet clear: **The Monarch owns the property by right of their position.** Not by right of any private ownership.

**If you're not the Monarch, you're not the owner.** Monarch is a legal position that will have been transferred to the Republic during the hypothetical transformation and writing of the new constitution.

Also, I keep having to look things up to answer questions, so I get to learn more about these things as I go.

&gt; I'm trying to digest all the information, this basically means, any time I choose a fund, it will cost £5 for me to put any money into it? Is this the case for adding more cash to a fund you already have a stake in?

That's my understanding, yeah. I think that will also apply to selling as well. You can always give them a call too / tweet at them if you want to be sure about these things: http://www.iweb-sharedealing.co.uk/about-iweb/contact-us.asp

&gt; That's exactly what I was failing to find, thank you!

Heh, no worries. I knew I'd seen it before but it's really not well surfaced at all.

&gt; Yes I invest in my company pension scheme as its matched up to 6%, so I max that out. I'm not yet a higher rate tax payer but I have looked a little at SIPP's for future. To be honest I've parked it for now as I want to get my s&amp;s isa index funds knowledge up to scratch and stop losing potential earnings by investing.

Awesome. Maxing the match is great, when you become a higher rate taxpayer you can always move money from the ISA into a SIPP / divert more funds there. Also, even if you don't open a SIPP you'll be able to claim back 25% of the amount you invest in your work pension*. A quick call / letter to HMRC will get your tax code adjusted so you can have the money immediately &amp; without hassle.

\* Everything you put into a pension is pre-tax. For 20% rate payers, this is automatically added onto the pension, for 40% you need to claim it back. So £80 in from your paycheque becomes £100 in the pension, then you claim £20 back so it costs £60 for £100 in the pension (gets taxed on withdrawal though, but nowhere near as much).

Lose your job = no sympathy. (i.e working for a living). Computers can do it better. Your living in the past.

Being on the dole = Perfectly fine cause computers(robots?) are able to stack shelves now and talk to customers etc?

I'd get the automation argument if we were talking about a factory or something but these are stores. Apart from the fact it's a basic human emotion for you to have sympathy for someone who has lost their job (even if it's inevitable that they will lose their job for reasons outside their control).

&gt;Deflation prevents any stabilisation during a recession as interest rates cannot be lowered enough due to the zero lower bound, and greatly increases unemployment because nominal wages cannot be cut. It also increases the real value of debt, meaning that debtors cut their spending, reducing other people's income, causing them to cut their spending, and creating a vicious cycle of economic depression. Similarly, if people expect prices to fall they'll delay some spending to when prices do fall, which will reduce other people's income and spending, creating a second vicious cycle.

&gt;CPI takes account of changes in size. If you have to buy 10% more toilet paper over the course of a year that's recorded as a 10% price increase for toilet paper.

&gt;The independent Billion Prices Project tracks CPI data very closely.. There is simply no evidence that inflation is a hell of a lot higher than 2-3%. (Shadowstats is bullshit.)

&gt;Weimar hyperinflation was due to the German money supply increasing from 115,000,000 marks in January 1922 to 497,000,000,000,000,000,000 marks in December 1923 - an annual rate of about 2,000,000%. Independent modern central banks will never print money at that rate, because they know it would cause hyperinflation and devastate the economy. The highest annual rate of growth of the monetary base (in the US) since 1984 was 113%, in 2009, and the M2 money stock (the type of money supply that actually causes inflation) has not grown at more than 10% a year over this period. Because of this, there is no reason for the markets to suddenly lose all confidence in the currency. It's utterly incomparable to Weimar Germany.

&gt;*(Sorry that a lot of this stuff is US-focused - most of you inflation truthers are American, so I already know of US data sources, but the facts are basically the same for the UK)*

His 91.2% failure rate that he quotes right at the very top assumes that any player who does not become, quote: ""superstars, world beaters, or sold for £millions of profit"" is a failure. No place for squad players. No place for impact subs. No. Every member of the squad must be a superstar or they are a failure. That is bullshit. 

The 45 players that he drew his 91.2% failure stat from includes the likes of Henderson, Sakho, Coutinho, Allen, and Enrique as well as all of our transfers from the most recent summer. The latter category have not had nearly long enough to prove themselves (especially Lallana and Markovic).And yet all are considered failures by his metric despite being, at worst, great squad players and, at best, Jordan fucking Henderson. However only Suarez and Sturridge are successes (and that's ""being generous""). Actually, that is bullshit.

Additionally, on that list we have 11 players who are 23 or younger (Ibe, Yesil, Coutinho, Teixeira, Alberto, Ilori, Can, Markovic, Origi, Manquillo, and Moreno). I'm glad he has the prescience to know that these youngsters will never make it at the club because I certainly don't. And who ever considered Yesil a first team buy? He was always a player with potential that we got on the cheap. He writes him off as a failure when he hasn't made an appearance at the age of 20. That is Bullshit.

And what the fuck is Origi doing on that list? The kid hasn't even been ours to select yet, and he's a failure? Bullshit!

Adding all of the senior players we have bought under FSG including all the youngsters I mention on my list above takes the total to 35. I counted. And yet he quotes us as having bought 45. The unnamed 10 (he never actually provided a full list, you will see) must be youth players for our u21 team or below. It's either that or he has straight faced lied. Are we really writing off U21s as well now? If so, that is Bullshit.

How am I supposed to take an article seriously when they start with bullshit stats made from a bullshit premise on a subjective bullshit whim?

I repeat.

This is Bullshit.

EDIT: So I just had a thought and decided to check his maths. I usually don't do this, but crap of this magnitude demands skepticism of even the most basic statements.

&gt;If you can find 2 more it’s pretty slim pickings out of 45 players right? That would make a transfer success rate of 8.8%, or another way of looking at it a 91.2% failure rate.

Their website says this isn't so:

&gt;Who owns The Crown Estate?
&gt;The Crown Estate belongs to the reigning monarch 'in right of The Crown', that is, it is owned by the monarch for the duration of their reign, by virtue of their accession to the throne. **But it is not the private property of the monarch** - it cannot be sold by the monarch, nor do revenues from it belong to the monarch.

This does not refer to the sovereign grant arrangement, which is the Monarch's ongoing deal with parliament that sacrifices the revenues of the crown estate to the treasury in return for an income. 

The website confirms:

&gt;How does the Sovereign Grant Act affect The Crown Estate?
&gt;The Act does not affect the managerial or operational functions of The Crown Estate or the way they are performed. We will continue to give our entire annual surplus (net profit) to the Treasury. **The Act simply provides a mechanism that will be used by the Treasury to determine the amount of Government funding for the Monarch by reference to the amount of our annual surplus.**

The sovereign grant act does not shift ownership of the crown estate in any way. You are incorrect to state otherwise.

In legal terms: The crown estate belongs to the Monarch by right of their position - if you are not the Monarch, *even if you were at one point*, you do not own the crown estate.

&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;As a result of the moves, there will be a slight reduction in overall force levels. However, Germany and Italy are expected to gain troops through the Pentagon’s moves.

&gt;It is expected to take several years for all of the Pentagon’s basing decisions to be implemented.

&gt;In all, the Pentagon expects to save about $500 million annually from the consolidations, which have been under review for more than a year.

&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------

&gt;In the case of the Army, most of the announced consolidations target small outposts and support infrastructure rather than key operational hubs.

&gt;For the past decade, the U.S. Army in Europe has been steadily drawing down and consolidating its network of garrisons around Europe.

&gt;----------------------------------------------------------

&gt;The pending closure of Mildenhall, however is the first major Air Force base elimination in Europe in years.

&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;The consolidations come as the U.S. and its allies in Europe attempt to bolster their presence in eastern Europe as part of an effort to reassure allies and deter Russian aggression in the region.

&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------

&gt;Plans to increase troop rotations throughout the region will continue, according to the Pentagon.

Clegg outright lies and says that Farage is attacking ""British Muslims who I know feel fervently British"" and saying that they are ""part of the problem.""

It's a pantomime by Clegg.  Any attack on multiculturalism, any call for more and better integration, is, according to Clegg, an attack on ordinary British Muslims.

You can stop a man with a knife with your hands, if you know what you're doing. You can't do the same with a man with a gun. 

This sort of attack, gods forbid it should happen, were to happen over here? Everyone within close distance of them opening fire is dead, without a chance of fighting back. People further out are going to run, and get shot in the back.

null,false,icStatic,null,null,null,"The main arguments against nuclear power are as follows:
* Cost - and this one is not easily argued against by the pro-nuclear crowd as history has shown cost skyrocketing over the last decade or so (possibly due to increased safety systems and regulation), however these high costs are mostly due to high pressure systems. Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) are significantly cheaper to deploy as they do not need high pressure components, and thus this will be a non issue with future technologies.


* Safety - Track record of safest technology aside, when nuclear goes wrong it goes catastrophically wrong. The best example of this is Chernobyl. Fukushima was bad but nobody has (yet) died as a result of radiation from the disaster to my knowledge. There was one (I think?) death at the plant but that was due to drowning during the tsunami itself when one of the basements of the building flooded. Again, if you only look at the newer technologies, MSR is passively safe.


* Waste - I'm running out of room to reply so its worth doing your own research on this, but the quantity is normally massively overstated with people confusing low grade (of which there is a lot, and its not a big deal) and high grade waste (which is crazy dangerous and there is a tiny tiny amount of).


* Centralisation - this is pretty much the 'we should build power plants closer to where we need them' argument. This partially makes sense, except that efficient power generation is always done on a larger scale. Again newer technologies can be built on a smaller scale, so this even fits that requirement.


* Industrial practices - they've got this one nailed though, the existing nuclear industry needs to be dismantled as its riddled with 'razor blade' models of expensive fuel, rigged pricing, broken trade agreements. I don't think profit has a place in energy production. But it gets lumped in with the technological issues as well. If we could separate them, we could address them.


* Proliferation - by pulling nuclear weapons into the argument they muddy the waters. Please keep the discussion of weapons out of the discussion of nuclear power. They are two separate topics these days, there is no longer an implicit link between the two as there was when it was first developed. Again, newer technologies CANNOT be proliferated and in some reactor types the fissile material from the weapons can be used as fuel, which the US is actively doing at the moment. If we had more of these reactor types we could increase destruction of our weapons stockpile.


There are probably other arguments as well but I think those are the main ones. I'll let somebody who is actually anti-nuclear tell me I've got it all wrong. Otherwise I'd suggest you do your own research and fact check all arguments yourself. If you see any argument made by Helen Caldicott, run a mile - she's a proven liar and nothing she says can be trusted.

BTW I realize now I wasn't clear about the use of MSRs, but molten salt technologies are relatively old, and unfortunately are not yet actively deployed in commercial situations. I've just got quite sick of the green groups tarring all 'nuclear' technologies with the same brush so that their stances blanket target all technologies in the same field, not specific problem technologies (for example water based reactor designs specifically, which is where most of the issues like).

null,false,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,null,"&gt; I am just wondering about the motivations of a rich father of the girlfriend he cheated on by raping (or even just having casual sex with) a drunk woman is?

Surely to clear the name of someone he believes to be innocent? Otherwise he'd not be spending the money, surely?

&gt; Who knows, it doesn't go as deep as... to improve rape conviction rate stats

There is certainly political pressure to improve rape conviction statistics and that's almost certainly what the police thought when they realised that Evans was prepared to say what actually happened.

&gt; his behaviour was despicable however you look at it.

Asking a girl id she wants to have sex with him, her saying ""yes"" and then the two of them having sex? Doesn't sound despicable to me. Or do you mean afterwards where she has been responsible for him spending two and a half years in prison him casting aspersions on her character? If he believes he is innocent then that seems entirely appropriate as well, nothing despicable there.

&gt; Allowing a witch hunt is not the way to deal with someone who has wronged you I'm afraid, the line has to stop somewhere, what else would he allow to continue?

He is hardly allowing a witch hunt by highlighting the facts of the case and relevant issues surrounding her behaviour. He hasn't threatened her and hasn't encouraged others to threaten her either.

&gt; People have been sending death threats, rape threats and hounding her out of her home several times remember

And these people might listen to Evans if he said not to, but if he is telling the truth then he doesn't owe her even that courtesy.

&gt; She is not responsible, his own actions are by raping her!

Only *IF* he did rape her and the evidence from the trial suggest otherwise (which is why people are so angry they are taking matters into their own hands).

&gt; What is she supposed to do if she can't remember the night in question, just lie to court about it?

No, she certainly shouldn't perjure herself in court and it is unfortunate that she cannot remember what happened (I have no reason to believe she is lying about that) but this reasonable doubt as a result of her lack of memory shouldn't have been enough for her to agree to give evidence against someone she didn't know was guilty or innocent but she chose to give evidence because she felt she would be considered a slut if she didn't (or so it appears).

&gt; It sends a dangerous message this - get raped by someone famous and you can kiss your life goodbye unless you say it was consensual.

The message is don't falsely accuse people of rape. I think everyone would agree that that is a good message, even if the way it is being delivered is open to criticism.

&gt; We wouldn't even be having this discussion if he apologised for his actions while maintaining his innocence

How can someone apologise for something they haven't done?

In Dier's case, not playing means that his development is basically stalled, and this is shaping up to be a wasted season for him.

All that said, we obviously need someone in the lineup who can back up Fazio and Vertonghen. Those two cannot continue to play every minute as they have recently. I'm fine with that being Eric Dier, but I'd much prefer to buy another reliable central defender and then have Dier as our fourth choice. In that case, if he goes out on loan to a lower Premiership or even upper Championship side, he could come back next season and give us two reliable pairings.

I think we will end up sticking to one stage for both runs of the stage. Seems to be the easiest logistic wise and from my experience with Rally events here in the US, unless you are working the stages and can drive through them go help marshal the next one, it is tough to drive from place to place then hike in. Even with our relatively small crowds for events.

I also think we'll follow the stages north each day and stay in an area close to each days events. I would like to see and stay in a few different parts of the country and explore it as much as possible for a few days before we head off for the remainder of our trip.

Now for most of them you would say they have done well , apart from maybe Agger , Reina and Suarez which people will debate .

The only debatable one in the above 3 for me is Agger , we should have held on to him .. Everyone was OK when Reina left , now that people see Migs having bad season they use hindsight to criticize that decision.

For me the FSG story is also more about getting dead wood out and putting a philosophy of playing at Liverpool again.. 

Another major positive for me is they have not been afraid to put there wrongs right.. Carrol , Downing etc.

Yes offcourse they have committed mistakes and yes Transfers is one of the areas they have been very weak in ... but its in no way a complete failure , the fact is that we have this tag of ""Liverpool the 5 time champions"" hanging over us while we have the quality of at most a top 10 side on an average for the last 5 years now .

FSG has shed that image and has started building from the bottom , I have no doubt that they will get the formula right and we will start seeing results soon...

There is a big grey area as you note, but the law is such that somebody can be extremely drunk before they are unable to give consent. If somebody is unable to move without assistance or talk clearly then you should probably not fuck them.

The legal requirement is that you're *unable to make a choice*, not that alcohol causes you to make a bad one. 

We're not talking about making a bad purchase while drunk. We're talking about stumbling into a shop so drunk you think it's your mate's house, when a salesman gives you a pen and gets you to sign some paper you don't understand and sells you a £20,000 TV that you never even considered buying.

Edit to your edit: if you hit somebody you made an active choice to do so and had a level of control over your body.

No it isn't. The laws of our land are a singular entity. They evolve, e.g. racism laws, as the diversity of our country changes, but you can't have two legal systems, e.g. Sharia law protected in staute, and hence we don't. So it encourages multiple groups to live under one system but to respect each other. 

&gt;Farage wants more integration of Muslims into our society. Helping them understand our values more, so that the few that wish to destroy us, don't.

So, at the extreme he advocates them not being Muslim any more, which is ridiculous. The 'few' are by definition extremists. Basis statistics would probably show extremists evolve no matter what safeguards you put in place.

I really don't think this is about integration though. Britain and France have a lot to answer for having reached beyond their borders, going back centuries. It's just plain politics for Farage to play up a popular feeling of resentment under guise of being anti multicultural.

There it is - two people say otherwise, but one person that *can't remember* says it must have been different. On top of that, if she was *that* drunk, the friend can't have had consent either *even if she gave it* - I don't remember more alcohol being mentioned after she went back to the hotel, and that's before we get to the apparently enthusiastic sex - so we're into consent when drunk = OK, consent when drunk = not OK.

&gt;I don't really get your point on gender. If the same situation happened to a man he could claim he was sexually assaulted or raped.

How likely do you think these events would lead to prosecution?

&gt;Also the fact that Evans' friend was found not guilty goes against your viewpoint.

Actually, it goes against the prosecutions' take. If she was *that* drunk, both men are guilty.

Off the top of my head, there's a few things you may not have considered:

* There will be rental fees and the like to deal with when you first start renting, as well as the deposit of course. These could come from your savings.

* You haven't got anything there for transport (how will she commute? If it's an existing vehicle it still needs fuel, insurance, servicing, taxing etc. If it's public transport, that'll incur a cost).

* No buffer for savings or inevitable rent increases over time.

Coutinho often times completely drags his shot past the left stick as i feel he struggles to get enough power on his shots which in turn affects his accuracy. Sterling is a little better when it comes to accuracy but he has an even bigger issue when it comes to putting his foot through the ball, his light weightedness and small frame restricts him from hitting the ball as true as he would like. Both players are extremely good when it comes to simple finishes and 1 on 1's with the keeper but these chances aren't being created when you have lambert up top who constantly comes to the ball and holds up play, never making runs.

Plenty of wing players have moved centrally with success, and Shaqiri has the skill set to do so. You know who else used to play the majority of games on the wing? Alexis Sanchez.

To me, Liverpool not even bidding on Shaqiri mixed with rubbish news about Milner/Delph shows that the team utterly lacks ambition to be a ""big team"". Time and time again the club passes on players with recognizable names from abroad and looks at either overpriced English talent, one season wonders from mid-table teams, or hits the bargain bin while also selling off developed talent.

That she was too drunk to have consented is subjective since they are going solely on CCTV evidence (i.e. ""she wobbled a bit there she must be shitfaced!"") and there was actually no alcohol left in her system by the time they ran blood tests the next day.

We have good CL Level qualification players for (at a glance) 6 starting positions (Coleman, Baines, Jags, McCarthy, Mirallas, Lukaku) and serviceable CL qualification players in another 3.5 (Naismith/Eto'o, Stones and Besic)... So we only really need 2 top players, plus a fair few depthies to be one of the real, genuine contenders year on year for CL (NB: This is providing we are in a tactical blip, and Martinez isn't a charlatan).

Essentially we need a really good left mid and a really good keeper to have a seriously fucking strong first 11- £30m could do that easily, and that gives us another £20m for the 3-4 or so depthies, and maybe another middling top player.

It is a young side we have, and all the players (minus Eto'o and maybe Baines) I mentioned above have a fair few years of top football left in them, and many of them are some years off peaking. Whilst £50m isn't a case of 'signed sealed delivered to the top 4', it gives us a realistic chance of getting it on a number of occasions over the next 6 years or so.

 Took me ages to properly 'get into' vaping and eliminate fags.  
  
  What I'd probably say is most important for people to think about it if they spend 20 quid on a kit that will allow them, even over the course of a week to save them smoking 40 fags the kit's already paid for itself.  
  
  If you get any more mileage out of it, it's free.  
  
  I've been through heaps of kits, starters and more advanced stuff - I've still got a vivid in my bits box for times that my other kits run out of battery, it's actually a good one to fall back on should you need it, but I find their juices pretty horrid.     
   
  I think for me what helped wasn't just thinking of it as 'a quitting tool' but starting to enjoy it once I found what sort of flavours worked for me, once of my favourites recently has to have been Dekang's Blackberry flavour which tasted like Vimto, and combining some odds and end together and ending up with something that tasted like a cheery bakewell :-D
 
  ***
   
  For juices, Hangsen and Dekang provide great value for money.  
  
  If you're looking to treat yourself, there are dozens of sites offering 'gourmet' flavours but I think the best collection you can find all in the same place is the following:  
  
  http://www.vapeclub.co.uk/  
  
 All their juices come with a tasting guide, but *these fuckers are seriously expensive*. If you're looking for something to treat yourself with though, you'll find it here.

 My kit - I mostly use my [Innokin MVP2] (http://www.amazon.co.uk/INNOKIN-itaste-MVP2-0-BLACK-Advance-Electronic/dp/4498744470) with a series of iClear30Bs. I've found that out of all the kits I've used, the MVP2 is the best value, has some nice unique features and is an absolute work horse, and cheap as fuck.  
  
 The iclear30bs, I just like the shape and rotatable mouth piece. Good airflow too, so they draw nicely. You can find them all over the place. The reviews on that product should pretty much speak for themselves, it *is* chunky and heavy but it'll serve you well, it'll charge your bloody phone (!) acting as a battery bank and has a cool light up display, with blue LEDs. Fuck yeah. http://i.imgur.com/Lm3C7nN.jpg and counts your puffs since you last charged it or since you last turned it off. That's largely useless but, cool none-the-less.

 One of the stupiest decisions I ever made was to start smoking, and it's taken me a lot of years to get to the point where I have something that I can honestly say not only helped me, but something that I also enjoy using.  
  
  I realise that I've swapped one thing for another, but I've lowered my nicotine levels steadily (back in my early 20s I could go through 40-60 a day!) and now I don't even miss fags. It's cheaper, I feel a hell of a lot better, and when I shop for new things I feel like a kid in a candy shop. 
 
 I love vaping.

Again such semantics avoid the reality of the big fat elephant in the room, what if its 5% or 15% or even 15%?? Does that justify the still vast, vast majority of abortions that are carried out for reasons other than those originally intended.

It may be hard to admit it but you should be honest with yourself and do so, abortion IS a form of birth control. It is, and that stats show it.

The whole issue really comes down to one question....

Either its permissible to terminate a pregnancy for ANY reason or its not.

If your happy with ""Right to choose"" fine but don't complain though when far eastern people in the UK are aborting girls in their thousands purely because of their sex or if the girl down the street is aborting her pregnancy because her boyfriend is a ginger and she doesn't want to risk it. Thats what you will inevitably get.

On the other hand if you believe abortion is NOT acceptable under certain circumstances........what do YOU determine those circumstances to be?

Evans and his friend both admitted to having sex with her, that is not in doubt. And as the court deemed she was too drunk to consent, that sex therefore must have been non-consensual.

The verdict doesn't imply she consented at all, it says that Evans' friend had reasonable belief of consent whereas Evans himself did not.  You should know that if you've read the case report you've linked.

You'd also know that the alcohol in her system from the night before was deemed to have left her system as she urinated in the bed whilst she was asleep.

The fact that Evans and his friend were drunk or not has no baring on the case.

The evidence is there, they admitted to having sex with her and the court ruled she was too drunk to consent to that sex.

If you're seriously suggesting that England lack technical players I think you're wrong. A more accurate argument would be that technical English players were previously overlooked in favour of more athletic players (For instance LeTissier who was snubbed by England and more old school type players picked instead).

We have plenty of players with technical ability coming through right now. For instance Sterling, Barkley, and Kane are all very young and demonstrating strong technical abilities. There are many other English players with great technique, dribbling, touch, volleys, skills etc and to claim otherwise is ignorant. 

What I'm getting at, is that the physical emphasis in English football meant that players with power and stamina as their main strengths were chosen in favour of technical players who are often smaller.

I got about 5 spots in one night on my forehead, so I decided to change my routine to:

AM:

* Wash face with water

* Simple Kind to Skin Toner

* Stridex in the Red Box (bha)

* Moisturise with Oilatum Natural Repair Face Cream

PM:

* Boots Simply Sensitive Foaming Cleansing Wash

* Olay Regenerist Night Renewal Elixir (aha)

* Put Neutrogena Visibly Clear Rapid Clear Treatment on spots

* Moisturise with Oilatum Natural Repair Face Cream

Could be hormonal, but all in one night seemed strange. I had just washed my hair, so I started to wonder if my hair conditioner (which contains fatty alcohols like most other things) could be affecting my forehead, even though I wash my hair over the bath to avoid contact with my face/back (and never in the shower).

I also used some of my coconut oil on my neck, and I'm really saddened because I have about 3 spots there now too. I like using coconut oil on my legs as it seems to get rid of the keratosis pilaris I get, in combination with using a Salux cloth. I'm going to run out of Oilatum moisturiser soon so I don't really want to use it on my neck. Therefore, any ideas for a body lotion that I can use around neck/décolletage?

I'm not suffering from any redness problems anymore which is good, but I'm fed up of all these spots. My skin was at its least spotty back in the day when I used the full Neutrogena Visibly Clear range, but my skin was always really dry feeling (I do still own a full bottle of Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control 3-in-1 Daily Cleansing Lotion which I might switch back to when my Stridex runs out, even though it contains drying - not fatty - alcohol). 

Last time I posted I was looking for an antioxidant but going to postpone that until I get a basic routine going that does not give me spots. I also got told I should go see a GP about getting a niacinamide prescription.

How do you figure this?  let me help you - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10613201  - Then take into account that any gains to our economy have almost exclusively gone to the top 10% only!

&gt; business environment

Yes, big business and banking are doing much better with such low taxes and can screw us over more.  Small/Med Business are not doing better though!

&gt; Long term plan to tackle deficit and debt

The same plan that was suppose to erase it by now.  Look, every economist of worth says you should work on deficit in good times, not bad.  I agree that labour over spent, but the facts are against Tory plans...

&gt; More credible government for foreign investment and debt

?!  our (consumer) interest rate is .5% and been that way a long, long time.  Not sure how you figure this one.

&gt; Lower taxes

For some the rich, yes.  oh, and corps :(

&gt; Gay marriage

I absolutely agree and congratulate Cameron for pushing this through to everyone's surprise.  But it surely would have happened under Labour.

&gt; Slowly fixing the university bubble

lol..  this is where I realize I am trying to reason with someone who can't be reasoned with.  Education is not, nor ever should be considered a problem.

null,false,Girlwithnousername,null,null,null,"- You'll pay more for a unit with 24 hour access than 8am-6pm access. The last one I had also opened on Saturday and Sunday, had a late evening (8pm) night and even for a few hours on bank holidays, and when 8am was too late for me, the manager said 'call me from 7.30am, I'll probably be here.' Access was therefore never a problem for me. 

- There are videos showing how much you can fit inside a typical unit on some of their websites. Look them up. You don't want to arrive having booked a 25sq ft only to find you need 40sq ft and they have none available, which is very nearly what I did. 

- You'll probably need to show ID and sign a contract. 

- Totally outdoor units exist, they look like shipping carriers, they'll be no good for amps and other band kit. They're a lot cheaper. Make sure you're getting an indoor unit.

- I had to sign in and sign out, and if there with a vehicle, write down the registration number. They kept an eagle eye on visitors from the office, but the gates were always open.

- My last place made me buy the lock from them, and insurance at around £5 a month.

- Signing up for a year gives you a LOT of bargaining power. Call many, get many quotes (in writing) and play them off against one another. They're all used to it and will be expecting it. One company refused to give it to me in writing for this purpose... yeah, I didn't go with them.

- You'll need to give a deposit which is refundable. I found the amount to be negotiable. 

- They're usually in old office buildings or warehouses. My unit didn't have any light in it... but it was close enough to other lights to be able to see inside. Sometimes, the lifts break down. So if you're banking on getting ALL your gear in or out on a particular day, I'd recommend calling them to make sure the lifts are working first thing (if your unit is above ground floor). They have huge trolleys on site for you to move your stuff from the vehicle to the unit.

- Don't store any food in your unit, not even rice. Okay, perhaps rice if it's in a metal tin, but not a bag of rice in a black sack.

No one is saying that women are discriminated against in the criminal justice system.   They do indeed already get shorter sentences for the same crimes.   This would effectively make it policy....


Now, taking that into account let's move to the point.  To make easy I will copy in the part from policy site

CJ381 Recognising the nature of the female prison population, with high levels of mental illness, experience of being a victim of crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence, and caring responsibilities for children, the only women who should be in custody are those very few that commit serious and violent crimes and who present a threat to the public.

CJ382 For the vast majority of women in the criminal justice system, solutions in the community are more appropriate. Community sentences must be designed to take account of women’s particular vulnerabilities and domestic and childcare commitments. The restrictions placed on sentencers around breaches of community orders must be made more flexible.

CJ383 Existing women’s prisons should be replaced with suitable geographically dispersed, small, multi-functional custodial centres. More supported accommodation should be provided for women on release to break the cycle of repeat offending and custody.

CJ384 Pregnant women in prison are particularly vulnerable and the scheme provided by the charity Birth Companions, which visits pregnant prisoners once a week, stays with them through birth and gives them support afterwards, should be extended to all women who wish to use it, with government funding.

Possibly unlike many, as disappointed as I am that he's leaving, I think it may be good for the club. His ageing legs couldn't fit our high pressing tactics and it was catching us out, whether he played in front of the defence, in a midfield two, or in the '10' position. The last few months many people have moaned when he's played in the defensive midfield role - because of his defensive capabilities. Then many people complained when he was left out. Then others complained that he was playing the 10 role. No matter what BR done with Gerrard he was always scrutinised. The best thing for BR is that Gerrard is leaving of (seemingly) his own accord.

You exist in a world where you will never be truly penniless.  You will always have employment for as long as you want it, you literally just have to ask a friend for a position and have a substantial reserve of cash and investments to tide you through interesting times.  You have access to the best medical care money can buy, the best education that your parents could afford was also supplied. 

In this world racism, bigotry and discrimination and indeed depression (or other mental illnesses) are words they are something you will, probably, never encounter or have to deal with.  It's something you have little to no understanding of. 

You were born in to this world, it's all you know.  So from that perspective why, exactly, are the unemployed as such and how believable is it when someone tells you that a sanction on their JSA means they can't eat or pay bills?

null,false,Digital_Pigeon,null,null,null,"I'm a centrist - I like the free market generally, but think there are situations where it's not appropriate, like health, railways, water etc. But I am in favour of a strong military and since you've asked nicely and seem to be genuinely interested in why, rather than just looking to start an ill tempered argument, I'll explain my position. 

I think we need a strong military for 2 reasons - 1) the simple fact that we can't predict whether or not we'll be at war with a powerful enemy in a decade or so (people who think that war is an entirely western invention should read more history), and if we were to scrap the military and then build it up again later it would lose its effectiveness. 

2) Believe it or not, I'm in favour of intervention in foreign conflicts if there is a clear democratic alternative to an oppressive authoritarian regime. Obviously this is very rare, and does not mean I was in favour of intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq. It does mean that I was in favour of intervention in Libya, and would be in Syria if there was a clear democratic alternative to support. 

I understand that this kind of intervention leads to power vacuums and more violence, but throughout history this kind of violent transitional period has been necessary in order for any country to become free and democratic. 

Lots of people like to suggest that the alternative to intervention is peace, but I think Syria illustrates that this is not the case. 

I think we have a moral duty as a rich, free country to assist democratic oppositions in their efforts to become rich free countries themselves. This assumes, of course, that the democratic opposition is capable of forming a new government and is in favour of the assistance, which I accept is very rare.

How do you quantify that saving of a life? 

Obviously if it's your life then the value is massive, but it's really hard to compare the two. I didn't mean to pick banker because of moral issues, but more because of the massive difference in pay to a nurse, and a web designer is sort of a neutral between the two. 

I think my weakness of thought is I sometimes see it as 'if the economy collapsed, who would actually have useful skills?' to which my answer is usually plumbers, nurses, teachers, doctors, builders etc - while a banker or a web designer or an SEO guy is no doubt skilled and economically valuable work, what actual use is it if you take away the economy?

Leaving out the likes of Ibe, Alberto, Teixeira.

For starters, that's a full fucking 6 players, two of which are leaving, the rest are younger and just potential players.

That leaves you with 4 starters in Sterling Coutinho Markovic Lallana.

3 of those 4 are better in central roles (Sterling, Cou, Lallana)

2 of those 4 are effective, or will be effective out-wide (Sterling, Marko(Who's on his way to being 'effective out-wide'))

IMO Shaqiri would've added quality into the starting eleven, whether we play with wingers or not. By not adding the quality when it's available it says to me that committee are massively prioritising the areas we need players in (Understandable) if they're willing to let a talent like this slip

If we had funds available surely we'd be atleast bidding for players like this when they're available despite having a few other similar players

Also: If you take the whole ""He isn't all that wonderful seeing as his current club dont want him"" attitude throughout all our transfers you're saying you wouldn't have signed Sturridge or Coutinho, two players on a short list of successful transfers from recent time, and that's considering Cou's intermittent form",null,0,null,1420733526,null,0,false,0,cnige80,null,t3_2rqqzn,null,t1_cnige80,null,t1_cnifbhl,null,null,null,1424990906,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Well, your opinion and the professional opinions of the current best club in Europe differ. They don't think he is that great after all.

&gt;Also: If you take the whole ""He isn't all that wonderful seeing as his current club dont want him"" attitude throughout all our transfers you're saying you wouldn't have signed Sturridge or Coutinho, two players on a short list of successful transfers from recent time, and that's considering Cou's intermittent form

Neither of those players were touted on here (or anywhere else) as wonder kids when we were signing them. Shaqiri is talked about on here like he is the new Ronaldo.

In addition, would you like me to list the players we've signed that were supposed to be ""wonder boys"" and turned out not to be?

Di Maria and Robben were proven players. Clubs could actually look at what they had done and judge their actual ability. Not so with Shaqiri. The only club that knows whether he is any good is the one that just decided to sell him.

Sturridge and Coutinho were both being sold at a time when nobody was calling them wonder boys... and the prices paid for them were not high. Not so with Shaqiri.

Not really. Hitler's theological inspiration, such as it was, stemmed from 'positive christianity' and indeed that's where a lot of the early moral weight came from in Nazi rhetoric. This happened around the same time as the Deutches Christian movement began to become more prominent. Basically it married idealised German history and national characteristics (stressing, for example, the German origin of the Reformation) and promoting an interpretation of christianity that stemmed larging from the writings of Paul on living a healthy, athletic life. There was a similar movement in Britain during the 19th century called 'muscular christianity' which took the same sort of approach; a chauvanistic, nationalistic, traditionalist interpretation. There were also, during the Nazi era, considerable attempts to dejudify the Bible, particularly removing the Old Testament influences.

That's not to say that the OT god wasn't a complete tyrant in the way only a particularly brutal human mind could conjure one up to be, but I don't think he was Hitler's inspiration.

null,false,PsyAndSnoop,,armchair revolutionary,null,"I agree with digital pigeon that some kind of military force is required to protect what Britain has built over the centuries. Now as much as it ever was it is necessary to protect ourselves from the threats posed by other nation states who themselves seek to project their power and influence in ways which threaten the sovereignty of other states and ourselves, Russia being the main example here.

I'm a pacifist and reject war in pretty much every circumstance, war is a human tragedy. Military spending, whilst important in furthering research and development in technological areas, also forms an important symbol of government funding a military industrial complex which is self perpetuating, protecting the interests of massive corporations and wealthy elites who's function is to provide the tools to wreak havoc and misery on poor and disenfranchised people the world over.

That said, I think it is unrealistic to go full Costa Rica and disband our military forces, it would leave us dependant on other states for our security, notably the USA, and we would be unable to independently pursue our own foreign policy or protect our people or interests in the face of threats to national security or public order.

We live in a changed world and the Cold War order I feel is no longer relevant. I feel we should reform our armed forces into a self defense force, tasked with protecting these isles and our outposts abroad like Gibraltar and the Falklands, and nothing more. We should scrap our nuclear programme and take a lead on nuclear disarmament (joethepro argued against this to me last week but I'm still not convinced it is necessary for us to project our power in such a way in the modern age). We should have a well trained and well equipped land army purposed with territorial defence, and a navy that serves the purpose of protecting our waters but which works with the navies of other nations to protect international waters and keep trade routes open. We should foster a spirit of international co-operation in defence matters, especially when dealing with rogue actors like Russia and North Korea, but not have international security rely on concepts like mutually assured destruction. In world of assymetric warfare, terrorism and cyber warfare, having a competent military is only one aspect of ensuring national defence in any case.

So I have wandered a bit, but the crux of the argument is that without some kind of defence force, in a world of numerous and uncertain threats, a country like the UK stands to lose a lot if we cannot defend what we have. In the same way I don't like that the police represent the monopoly of state force against the people, I acknowledge that without the police things can quickly go to shit like in the 2011 summer riots. Having an army doesn't mean however that we can't take a lead in trying to have a more peaceful world and fostering good and constructive relations with as many nations as possible.",null,0,null,1420735613,null,0,false,0,cnihlr1,null,t3_2rqv9v,null,t1_cnihlr1,null,t3_2rqv9v,null,null,null,1424990341,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

I haven't read any of that either - so I think it's just that you missed the subtext which other people (correctly it seems) inferred from his post.

&gt;I thought the tiers were just meant in general terms. As in if you put military power of countries, or best footballers, or most influential pop artists or whatever into tiers. I don't know how he menat it, maybe you are right, but to me it seemed just an easy way of talking about the rough levels of power.

Even if he were, putting bankers at the top is absurd, and it's obviously going to put people in mind of the classic anti-semitic world view of the world being secretly controlled by a cabal of bankers manipulating everything to their own nefarious ends.  Perhaps you're not aware of the history behind this; it might be worth looking into.

&gt;Are you saying this makes it any less of a problem? Or that the impact is neglible? If so I'd have to disagree.

I certainly don't like the idea of people like the Koch brothers interfering with democracy by using their fortunes to fund political campaigns and lobbying, but yes, it's absolutely less of a problem than the idea that there is deliberate conspiracy of secret rulers of the world to manipulate the populace and politicians into creating wars and deciding their outcomes for their own profiteering.  

One is undemocratic and outrageous, the other is positively dystopian.

null,false,Byfie,lfc12,,null,"&gt; £15m on yet another young AM would be a waste. We do not need to strengthen AM when there are at least 4 other positions where we don't even have A SINGLE satisfactory starter right now (GK, LB, DM, ST).

Fair point, but to me that only becomes valid when we actually sign replacements in those areas. Which is why my original point was that to me it hints at either a lack of funds or a lack of interest in Shaqiri. The latter IMO being a bad decision, but we'll see how it goes. I suppose less attention goes onto those 'wonderkids' who don't develop when we don't sign them compared to when they're hated on for not being instantly ready, with Markovic being an example of 20mil wanting to be an instant addition to the team, which is fair but pretty short term thought

&gt;Well, your opinion and the professional opinions of the current best club in Europe differ. They don't think he is that great after all.

Do I think he's good enough for Bayern right now? Of course not. But he's also been sought after by a number of clubs. Bayern also turned down bids in the summer (http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11669/9458200/transfer-news-liverpool-failed-with-bid-for-xherdan-shaqiri) and I highly doubt his ability suddenly dropped in those 6 months. He's forced a move as he isn't *currently* at their standard. You could comment on why those clubs are now no longer interested, but to me it seemed like a risk worthy of taking

&gt;Neither of those players were touted on here (or anywhere else) as wonder kids when we were signing them. Shaqiri is talked about on here like he is the new Ronaldo.
In addition, would you like me to list the players we've signed that were supposed to be ""wonder boys"" and turned out not to be? The list is much longer than 2, which further illustrates that when a ""wonder boy"" is being sold by a club (especially a big club), they probably aren't all that wonderful in reality.

If that's the general opinion on here then it's massively exaggerated, as it can be with young players. To me a lot of the time it's a player pushing for more playtime as they reach their 20's, which at a top team isn't easy to come by. 

We as a club have hardly gone after any of these 'wonderkids' though, I'd love to see the list that you mention. 

I think I'd just rather see us either make a gamble like this on a bigger name who's after some game time, or actually come out and sign the players we need in the positions we need. Again it's early in the window and it's only january, but as I've said a few times I'll be disappointed if we've missed out on this and still don't sign replacements in those areas",null,0,null,1420735956,null,0,false,0,cniht4q,null,t3_2rqqzn,null,t1_cniht4q,null,t1_cnigr3h,null,null,null,1424990246,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

&gt; We are a sick society, we deny our nature, we run from the consequences of our actions and come up with terms like ""forced birth"". We cull our offspring to feed our appetite for consequence(less) sexual liberty. Never in history has a society controlled it's own population and called it freedom in quite the same way.

Romans and Greeks were close personal friends with the word abortion, especially lower classes. Also, child mortality was higher than too which also bred some of the sentimentality out of having young kids die, which is something much more recent in history (I can cite some sources from contemporary Victorian sources that couldn't understand Queen Victoria's grief over stillbirths etc). So, you're wrong on this count.

&gt; Abortion is the unfortunate consequence to a bad decision. Contrary to popular belief there is no such thing as free love, sex always has consequences, it's great fun, I love it BUT you gotta be a big boy (or girl) and man up to the consequences of your actions, not take it out on the next generation.

You complete fucking moron. What decision? ""Oh, I feel like being raped tonight!"". ""I sincerely hope this condom breaks!"". ""I hope my pill fails tonight!"". Know what else is an unfortunate consequence to a bad decision? Saying completely fucking moronic shit like this.

&gt; And as a citizen of this country I am just as entitled to express my well thought out view as anyone else, I'm happy to explain it and defend it and at this point in my life I'm not to fussed if it's not popular or doesn't improve my karma on reddit

Now let's look at a poll on the constituency in November 2014.

&gt;Tories 13%

&gt;Labour 54%

&gt;UKIP 25%

&gt;LibDems 4%

This shows that UKIP is much more of a challenger to Ed Miliband's seat than any other. Another northern seat, Keighley, has UKIP on 23%, tories on 31 and Labour on 37%. If they tories didn't stand UKIP would probably win the seat from labour.

Sorry, don't agree at all. Reality aside, why would a footballer be held to a higher moral standard than a policeman, a judge, an attorney or a psychiatrist? If you were to ask me this question cold in a multiple choice format including those other professions I mention, I'd never choose a footballer as a first choice, and I'd suspect much nobody else would.

That said, I think it's difficult for critical Muslims to display affinity towards any existing outcry while people continue to push offensive images as a means of expressing solidarity.

null,false,Zoneghost,null,null,null,"So you've highlighted the biggest issue: ""men need to report when they get taken advantage of by women"". Many men, including myself, take the attitude that even when I am absolutely shitfaced (and I have been) then if I consent to sex it is my own lookout. In fact I'd go so far as to say that I have almost certainly, in the strict sense of the word, been raped. I sure as hell don't believe that is true, I don't remember it and I do regret it (and she should have known better) but I don't really care. Maybe I should care on a grand moral level but in reality I just chalk it up to experience of being an idiot.  
  
This difference in attitude is a major factor here and many people simply can't reconcile to the fact that you can be too drunk to consent as a guy. Interestingly, because you are too drunk to consent, whether you think you were raped or not is something of a moot point and largely nothing to do with you. You therefore end up in a situation where the law is applied extremeley one-sidedly and can't really be called fair. Fairness of the law would probably include a provision that meant that where the victim let actively opted not to pursue for a sufficient period then it dropped off - a provision which I recognise has *serious* problems but would avoid that odd situation where a person is said to ""not realise they were raped"" (and no I am not talking about not remembering). The idea of not realising is all well and good when you are too young but I can see problems when you are an adult who chose to get shitfaced. That would, I guess, make the point that if you don't consider it rape then it probably isn't - thus probably bringing more parity to the whole situation and eliminating the gender disparity.  
  
Finally, you say they need to stop taking advantage to eliminate the disparity. That's redundant: they should be doing that anyway. ",null,0,null,1420737474,null,0,false,0,cniipup,null,t3_2rqk79,null,t1_cniipup,null,t1_cniff0p,null,null,null,1424989823,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

I'm not sure I've seen people ""blindly shout[ing] ""rape is rape"""". You have? More so than just the far fringes of the bell curve, I mean? That area will always be populated. The wording of your comment implies that you see those people as sort of frothing at the mouth and can't be reasoned with. Personally the people I see making that kind of point have come to that conclusion by careful thought and consideration of the issue. Also I'd say that the people who try and discuss the 'different types of rape' aren't women, I don't think. (Disclaimer: I'm a man).

I'll use the recent example of Dawkins (mainly because I can't think of another overt example). He tweeted (after some initial comments &amp; response): [""Date rape is bad. Stranger rape at knifepoint is worse. If you think that's an endorsement of date rape, go away and learn how to think.""](https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/494012678432894976)

Leaving aside the whole discussion surrounding that, my response such comments that try and draw distinctions is: ""So what?"" 

If we phrase it slightly differently: 

1 - This type of rape is bad.
2 - This type of rape is bad as well, but worse.

Leaving aside the subjective aspects - that some people will be traumatised worse than others given the same or different situations - and ignoring that there will be different issues in either case: consider that someone is very likely to be devastated that a friend could do X to them etc... we're left with what I think is a pointless statement. It's something that doesn't need to be said. I can't think of one good reason why. Someone might, but really I'm stuck for one. Why do we need the metric? Other than for the courts, perhaps, and sentencing but the law exists. Dawkins' point was what?

The only outcome I can see from comments like that, though I don't think that's anyone's intention necessarily, is victim dismissal or downplaying the crime perpetrated against them: ""You were raped in way 1? Well that's not as bad as way 2. Some people have suffered more than you."" which effectively leads people to being told to shush and go away.

Comment like that help no-one and means nothing, so far as I can see.

I've seen similar on here several times. One in particular was following Dave Lee Travis' conviction. Admittedly the guy complaining on the thread had previously commented that the court case was a waste of time etc. but he was adamant that DLT's conviction was ""for the most minor [assault] he could have committed."" In essence: ""It wasn't as bad as what could have been done... [so let him off/this is a waste of everyone's time and money/what's she complaining for?].""

Your point about robbery &amp; murder/manslaughter: Yes indeed. Are either of those two treated in a similar fashion to rape and sexual assaults? The crime of rape has, probably for good reason, some sort of 'special' status and while murder is abhorrent it's generally far more clear cut than rape. For starters it's highly likely most people will immediately empathise: ""Obviously the person dying didn't want to be killed."" How often does that sort of thing get said about sexual assaults? ""We don't know that she didn't want to have sex."" rather than ""Obviously that person didn't want to be raped.""

&gt; there are varying circumstances around everything.

Indeed though when someone's killed in a way that implies non-accident, I doubt many people will initially think to dismiss the notion that a murderer might be involved because the dead person migjt have been suicidal. Nor when someone's mugged for their wallet do people question whether or not they were a willing participant because of how often they give to charity, or whether or not they are really a victim because they were walking down a dark street in a 'bad' part of town.

As a final thought, just to possible confuse your view of me: I'd very much like to see the law changed in the UK to allow the criteria for women to be rapists as well as men. Currently the rape definition stands as ""penetration by the penis"". There will likely be for and against arguments for that, so I suppose I should look into it more really.

_______

**TL;DR** - Rape and sexual assault are somewhat unique in how they are viewed by society and how they are dealt with, or not, by the authorities. Consequently I'm not sure the comparison to murder/theft or to anything else can be made. Certainly those people who ""blindly shout"" (they don't do that - they've thought about it) that ""rape is rape"" are, I think, coming at it from the angle that rapes are so poorly reported, charged &amp; convicted etc. that getting the general idea out regarding what is and isn't a rape (e.g. if you don't want to &amp; there's no reason for someone to take consent as implicit, then it's rape) is far more important than discussing the nuances of whether one 'type of rape' is worse than another. That 'discussion' helps no-one and probably does both direct and indirect damage to others: ""Well you weren't *raped* raped.""

By the by: ""fucking murder"" could be initially consensual, but is likely to be either rape or necrophilia depending on the sequence of events.

Everything else is just lost deposits. 

But that aside, what you say is not true 

&gt;This is an election to run the entire country not just a region. The SNP simply aren't contesting enough seats.

The next parliament is likely to be hung, the number of seats does not need to be that high to be important enough when it comes to coalition or confidence and supply agreements. 

In practice the SNP are likely to hold far more seats than UKIP and going to be far more important when it comes to the balance of power.

Too often on Reddit, when the Greens come up people pick over some of the Green party policies (which is easier than trying to pick over the non-existent UKIP policies)

The Green party is the only party that lets members vote on their manifesto. So if a bunch of people were to join and get involved, then extreme policies could be changed.

In fact, there are people in the Green party who are trying to do this. See this thread here: http://www.reddit.com/r/UKGreens/comments/2rdcbc/nuclear_power_is_the_greenest_option_say_top/

User /u/icStatic points out that there are members of the Green party who are trying to change the policy on nuclear energy but are battling against older, longer standing members. More details on this here: http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/2fxl9p/green_party_a_nuclear_debate/

An influx of younger educated people as members could be exactly what the Greens need, and would be a far more constructive protest vote than voting for UKIP

I'll first pull out what was, in my opinion, the most interesting declaration made:

&gt; In some respects [Harry] mirrors Tottenham Hotspur as a football club and that’s why I think we love him so much.

This statement is interesting enough that it could be a thesis of a decent article, but there simply isn't enough substance to back it up.  There are a number of similarly empty statements, which could be of interest, but there simply aren't the details to back up your opinions.  Don't **tell** us the way something is; **show** us.  And do it in a focused way, rather than jumping around so much.

Additionally, the quality of the actual writing is a bit...first-draft-like.  Some of the writing includes actual grammatical errors while elsewhere it simply comes off as a bit clunky.  Switching verb tenses a number of times, for instance, can be jarring to the reader.  Adverbs which don't add anything or are redundant would be better off omitted.  Beginning a paragraph with a conjunction is generally frowned upon. Etcetera.

I think you would benefit in the short term by having someone you trust run through and edit your work to nip some of these issues in the bud prior to sharing it with the world.

TL;DR:  Trim fat.  Add meat.  Good luck.


EDIT: I included an example of an edited paragraph, to illustrate my points.

&gt; ~~However,~~ for me ~~and a number of other Spurs fans~~**,** the affection for Harry Kane runs much deeper than that [ED: this is an ambiguious pronoun at this point. reiterate what ""that"" is.]. A part of it [ED: Again, ambiguous pronoun. What is ""it""?] is that he’s one of our own. He grew up nearby, [ED: Consider separating list into multiple sentences and adding substance to each point.]  he was a product of our youth system and he’s very, very [ED: one ""very"" would be superfluous here.  Instead of ""very, very"", consider a phrase such as ""the epitome of"" or ""a prime example of"".  Also back this up with what makes him such.]  English. He’s also goofy, humble, a bit daft and egoless [ED: Does this sentence back up your thesis?  These attributes are not related to the prior clauses, so I would suggest either omitting or adding a transition.  If kept, add concrete examples of when he has shown that he is goofy or humble or daft or egoless to drive it home.]. He genuinely seems like ~~just~~ a normal guy, [ED: clunky transition.  Consider separating into two sentences] who has worked hard to get where he is now [ED: all of these declarations would be driven home with some concrete examples]. In some respects this [ED: ambiguous pronoun.  What is ""this""?] mirrors Tottenham Hotspur as a football club and that’s why I think we love him so much. [ED: OK, so show how Harry exemplifies these things with examples, and show how THFC exemplifies these things to build this case.  Consider pushing this higher up the paragraph if it is the thesis of the paragraph, and check all details to ensure they support this thesis.  Omit those that don't, or move them elsewhere in the article.]

null,false,Zoneghost,null,null,null,"You seem to have missed my point.  
  
Not caring is **irrelevant** to whether an offence was committed. The mens rea of the victim is only a component of the crime insofar as their consent (or lack thereof) is concerned. It is therefore only relevant to consider whether a person commits a crime in the circumstance where a victim chooses to pursue the matter or not.  
  
As to the ""strawman"".  
  
First: please inform me where I am misrepresenting the point that was made by /u/mejogid (the key component of a straw man fallacy)? I was making the point that a law is only as good as it's application. Ultimately, if society feels it is less likely for a man who is so drunk he can't consent to have been raped than a woman then the law is not working properly. The effect is to prejudice - even if not the intention. This is a simple response to his (her?) argument - not a fallacy.  
   
Second: The point I was making was that whilst /u/mejogid was saying that men should report the crime more I don't think that the same action is viewed in the same light. I was also intentionally ambiguous in how I phrased it because I can only back my evidence up by largely circumstantial evidence and the overwhelming consensus of the reputable studies I've read.  
  
On the other hand, saying that ""the facts are"" to refute my argument is extremely interesting. You are correct: women are more likely to report a crime, consider a crime as having been committed and are more likely to proceed to trial. However, given that the fact that the crime has occurred regardless of the opinion of the person against whom it was committed, but is not likely to be reported because it is not socially acceptable to consider it a crime, then you cannot possibly know whether a man is more or less likely to have been attacked (strictly in the context of too drunk to consent). There is no reliable data. So no, it is not a fact, it is an inference.  
  
Third: ""you have the same rights and protections as women"" is only correct in the strict senses of those words. Given that society at large has problems recognising men as victimes of sexual assault then those rights and protections are clearly inadequate since they are not enforced appropriately. A right is only as good as its application.

-other parties follow suit

-by diluting the debates, Cameron takes pressure off of his own lacklustre debating skills, while simultaneously reducing the legitimacy of UKIP (much less impressive if UKIP is one of 5 or 6 than one of 4)

*Greens excluded*

-Cameron can refuse to do debates, taking pressure off of his own lacklustre debating skills

-as a byproduct this also defuses some UKIP legitimacy

null,false,canard_glasgow,null,null,null,"&gt;Last time I checked UKIP have a scottish MEP (and a Welsh one). Keep pretending you're a world apart from the English though.

The Ofcom recommendations suggest that UKIP is only given major party status in England and Wales. If you think one Scottish MEP is enough to give them UK status despite their abysmal Scottish polling the I suggest you respond to the Ofcom consultation. If UKIP are not given major party status in the UK then it stands to reason that they should not be included in UK wide debates unless the same concessions are made to other regional parties. 

&gt;If the SNP are included then you have no case against the DUP et al.

There is no fair argument that includes UKIP but excludes the SNP (in many the SNP is included before UKIP). If you want to also include DUP and Plaid you get to the point where a debate becomes unworkable and you would be best to exclude the second option I gave above. Leaving 

1) A UK wide debate between Labour and Conservatives (potentially also the Lib Dems).

2) Regional debates between the major parties for those regions.

It says much more about the Tories. It shows some of them see UKIP as appealing, because to them, the Tories aren't suitable. The fact is, UKIP are offering something that a considerable amount of people find appealing. The fact that the furthest (and largest) to the right main party has had MPs defect to, well, an even more right-wing party, shouldn't be a surprise.

&gt;I think that people are talking at cross purpose when they argue about whether UKIP is raging Tory or cross party appeal

I'd say they could possibly have policies that people right or left see desirable. Farage has said he wants out of the EU, many people agree with this. Removal of tax on the minimum wage, somewhat left wing but it's a good policy. 


&gt; but I think that they are mostly single issue voters who have been conned by right wing populism blaming all of their problems on the EU. 

I disagree. The EU and immigration are a big part of UKIP, but there are other reasons, such as they like the policies they seen in the EU elections.

&gt;UKIP's actual candidates and central party are painfully obviously right wingers who would sit on the far right wing of the Tory party if UKIP did not exist.

In addition, Green policy advocates increased bonus taxes for financial services workers and an FTT (or financial transaction tax), which would arguably be extremely damaging to the City of London and all the companies within it.

&gt;The quality of a debate (which is normally low as it is) is inversely proportional to the number of participants. You can't have debaters properly cross-examining each other's policies when there are too many people to do that with in the time you're given. What's more, you have less time to make your points the more participants there are. It means you quickly approach a cap on the number of participants before the debate is rendered entirely pointless - and a series of interviews would be more informative. So with each participant added, you have less time to make your points and more points to make... You can't take an ""as many as possible"" approach, though it would be nice if the debate format realistically allowed it.

&gt;If there is to be a solid criteria, it should be on the basis of a combination of factors. Labour and the Conservatives should be included as the only guarantee about the next Government is that it will involve at least one of those parties. The Lib Dems have a substantial number of MPs and are part of the current Government, and deserve to defend their record. UKIP poll higher than the Lib Dems and have come second in every(?) by-election for the past couple of years, with the exception of that one [two now] that they won, as well as the European Parliament elections where they topped the poll.

&gt;The fifth party (if we exclude regional parties and consider the Greens of E&amp;W and the Scottish Greens to be the same party), is the Green Party. While they do occasionally poll higher than the Lib Dems, they don't on a consistent basis like UKIP which polls a multiple of the LD support. While they do have an MP, that's pretty much all they have, and a bit like ""Respect"", it's due to concentrated support in a single constituency, not a nation-wide trend like UKIP. The Lib Dems have just under 60.

&gt;[...]

&gt;Let's put some numbers on this. Suppose a debate is 90 minutes long. With 12 debaters as is the result of your proposal [that having a single MP should qualify you for a national debate], each speaker gets a mere seven and a half minutes. Less, really, because that's not taking into account that the moderator will also be speaking, as well as probably members of the audience. You can't have a meaningful debate like that. The public can't possibly take anything from it. Put it up to two hours - that's still only a theoretical ten minutes each.

&gt;It does not follow [from the idea that democracy is healthiest at its most diverse] that a debate is the best way to go forward with this. In my opinion, they are not compatible with a parliamentary democracy. [...] It puts too much focus on a presidential style and you rarely get anything of much substance out of them.

&gt;A series of major interviews broadcast at prime time would do better. Doorstep campaigning would do better. Debates are one of those things which sound like a good idea, but they really aren't. And worse still, when we increase the number of participants beyond the capabilities of the format.

It goes without saying, Cameron is doing this either as a way of getting out the debates (there were years and years between the USA's first and second presidential debate rounds), or as a ploy to try and split the left vote and dilute the coverage UKIP gets from them. 

In my opinion, if we are to have debates at all (which we shouldn't), the Green party have no claim whatsoever to a place on them, and indeed it would be damaging for them to do so.",null,0,null,1420743002,null,0,1420743877,0,cnim5b7,null,t3_2rra4y,null,t1_cnim5b7,null,t3_2rra4y,null,null,null,1424988222,null,9,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,9,null

 [**Designated Player Rule**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated%20Player%20Rule): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __Designated Player Rule__, nicknamed __the Beckham Rule__,  was adopted as part of the [salary cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap) regulations of [Major League Soccer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer) for the 2007 season. The rule allows each MLS franchise to sign players that would be considered outside of the team's salary cap (either by offering the player higher wages or by paying a transfer fee for the player), allowing MLS teams to compete for star players in the international soccer market.

&gt;The rule is informally named after soccer star [David Beckham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham), in anticipation of MLS teams signing lucrative deals with internationally recognized players of Beckham's caliber.   Beckham was the first player signed under this rule, signing a five-year contract with the [Los Angeles Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Galaxy) with guaranteed annual salary of $6.5 million.

WARNING: WALL OF OPINION/TEXT BELOW

     Okay, so I've looked at our squad (admittedly mainly the first team) and I think that we may be aiming in the wrong places as far as transfers are concerned. Everyone is clamoring for a robust, ball winning, tyrant of a defensive midfielder.. I think we've got one in Emre Çan. He's an absolute physical specimen, he has great ball skills, an eye for a pass, and isn't at all afraid to get stuck in (think Balotelli). Furthermore, he's shown the tactical awareness and discipline to play in the back. While he could certainly go on to have a decent career for us there, I can't help but believe that he could develop into a world beater of a central midfielder. Now I know that the whole Gerrard thing is still raw, but let's look at (prime)Stevie's main attributes:

Leadership
Passing range/set piece delivery
Long shots
Driving runs
Physique/Athleticism/Stamina
Versatility

   When I look at Hendo, Allen, Çan, Coutinho, and Lucas, the only two players coming near that constellation of ability are Henderson and Emre. For me, Hendo has better stamina than Çan, but everything else is either really close or maybe even in Çan's favor. I firmly believe that Emre Çan has the leadership ability (captain of German youth sides), technique, athleticism, and versatility to dominate the midfield in a way that I'm afraid Jordan Henderson is simply too limited to do. Now, if Hendo somehow developed a cannon of a shot overnight, this changes a bit. For now, he passes up/shanks a few too many opportunities for me.  I say we sign a defensive coach or maybe a veteran, ball playing, organizer to hold down the back and let the beast loose in the middle of the park.


As far as attacking options go, I'm wary of signing anyone, really. The inflated prices of the January window aren't very attractive to me, and I think we've really found something in our new formation with all the attacking talent we have. I would have certainly welcomed Shaqiri, but to be honest I'm still hoping for Markovic, Sterling, and Coutinho to continue their development. That said, one name that we've been linked with, however reliably, that throws up a red flag is Alexandre Lacazette. His skill set, age, and prolific scoring record remind me of targets we lost out on in the past. Namely, I wonder what could have been had we signed Aguero from Atletico or Lavezzi from Napoli. Both of those players were fast, skilled dribblers with the kind of directness and vision that is highly valued under Rodgers. I think that of we let him slip into a rival's squad, we'll come to regret it.

In conclusion, I know that I don't know that much, nor do any of us for that matter, but I do believe that it doesn't take an expert transfer committee to identify needs in the side. So, here are my recommended buys/transfers for this window:


Forwards: Lacazette. That's it. Do not go wasting money on Berahino when we have other needs.

Midfielders: Move Çan into the midfield and let him grow. Commit to giving him playing time. Other than that, I would welcome a move for a clever, but deep lying playmaker. The likes of Pjanic, Kovacic, and that Belgian lad for Roma come to mind.

Defense: This is a tricky one because it's hard for me to just wrote off Lovren, but someone like Hummels, Pique, Varane, koscielny, etc.. A center half that can do a bit of everything, but dominates set pieces especially. Not saying we could get any of them, but that's the mould of player I'd look for. 

GK: ... Christ I'll sign up at this point. Anyone is better than Migs. Seems a decent enough lad, but his confidence is shot and we don't have the time to let him get back on his feet. Unfortunate, but the game's not based on sympathy; it's based on production.

null,false,TheConnivingPedant,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"The main problem with deflation isn't about consumer spending, but about investment. While consumption represents the majority of GDP (about 80%), it changes very little from year to year. The business cycle is driven almost entirely by changes in investment which can fluctuate wildly from year to year; a recession is largely a sudden stop in investment rather than a sudden stop in consumer spending (though this also plays a part). So the question becomes, what drives investment decisions?

To put it simply, a business in make new investments if they think they will make money off of those investments. More specifically, if they think they have a better chance of making money from an investment than from putting that money in the bank and earning the risk-free rate of interest. So on one side of the equation you have a prediction of the likelihood of making a profit (i.e. ""confidence"") on the other you have the interest rate, and the former has to be higher than the latter. The interest rate in question is the ""real interest rate"", after inflation.

Now, when the interest rate is low, it makes sense to make more investments because you get nothing from keeping your money in the bank. This is why central banks cut interest rates in a slowing economy; to stimulate investment by making the alternative unappealing. Likewise if you raise interest rates you slow down the economy and can even create a recession.

If inflation is positive then the central bank simply set a higher nominal rate to compensate, i.e. if inflation is 2%, the bank wants a 3% real rate, it sets nominal rates at 5% because 5-2=3. If you have deflation then that minus sign becomes a plus and the bank has to set its nominal rate lower; if inflation is -2% then nominal rates have to be 1% to make a 3% real rate, 1--2=3.

The problem today is that nominal rates are 0% and cannot get any lower. If deflation set in then *real* interest rates are suddenly being pushed up, which discourages investment and can push us into recession, which is something we don't want. That's pretty much why deflation is bad, it makes investment unprofitable, stifling growth while taking away one of the two main tools for encouraging growth.",null,0,null,1420746243,null,0,false,0,cnio59z,null,t3_2rqby6,null,t1_cnio59z,null,t3_2rqby6,null,null,null,1424987262,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

So, for us, Bentaleb (Algerian international) will always count as home grown because he spent three years at our academy, while Dier (English) will never count as home grown.

That's my understanding though; perhaps I'm wrong. I've never actually looked through the regulations.

EDIT: I checked it out. Here's the rule.

&gt; A Home Grown player will be defined as one who, irrespective of his nationality or age, has been registered with any club affiliated to the Football Association or the Football Association of Wales for a period, continuous or not, of three entire seasons or 36 months prior to his 21st birthday (or the end of the season during which he turns 21). [source](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2137974-premier-league-home-grown-rules-explaining-epl-player-quotas)

So, assuming that Ings was registered with a club in England--almost certainly, since he's English--for the three years prior to being 21, he's home grown no matter what club he later plays for. So it looks like you're absolutely right, he would be a home grown player for us.

Rangers' place in the league was bought by the same people who bought out the name and stadium and decided to form a new club, much in the way that Aerdrie United were formed after Airdrieonians stadium was bought out, and Clydebank's place in the league was bought out following their liquidation. They've now changed their name to Airdrieonians. So are Airdrie actually Airdrie, or are they Clydebank, or are they a wholly new entity? I would argue that they are a whole new entity.

The only reason that the league ""allowed"" the new Rangers to retain trophies etc was that their best bud, the inept Neil Doncaster, went greeting to FIFA to get them to say that they were the same club so that Scottish football wouldn't have to face ""armageddon"". The SPFL's corruption, utter incompetence, and complete willingness to ignore the rules to Celtic and Rangers benefit, is the only reason the circus that is The Rangers is allowed to continue.

All the rest have their strong suit but offer little in terms of completeness. Schurrle doesn't have a particularly great defensive head but is incredibly clever going forward. And can't really cross that well. Willian is similar but much better defensively. And then Salah, I don't know what you'd call his strength. His pace? Without the ball?

Shaqiri has the potential to be a more complete player imo. In terms of stature he reminds me of Aguero. In that he's short and built. Leagues apart at the moment but Aguero has got 3 years on him. At the same time Salah is only 22. So I'm probably being harsh. But when we're mooting Salah for the boot and Johnson in?

Here's a few snippets I've just pulled from their site:

- Tackle climate change faster and more effectively by moving Europe from a fossil fuelled economy to one powered by renewable energy.

- Stop the privatisation of our National Health Service and where possible reverse public service sell offs. Bring the railways back into public ownership and build new local lines and trams.

- Turn the national minimum wage into a genuine living wage. (They have also endorsed a basic income, which will be needed sooner than later because of automation advances)

- Scrap the welfare cap to ensure that we can truly help the poorest and most vulnerable in our society. 

- Enforce a cap on bankers’ bonuses and reduce the pay gap between those at the top and those at the bottom.

Why not?  The carer services are PROFITING! take ALL that money back and I'm betting it would make up more than the difference to care for everyone who needs it, it just won't make rich shareholders richer is all.

I agree with you that this seems to be the case and it may very likely be true (that she didn't consent to Evans) but I just think it is too subjective to convict someone on.  Whether she was too drunk to consent is subjective (whether it be from a kebab shop owner or a taxi driver) and whether he had reasonable belief of consent is subjective (presumably his reasonable belief is dependent on her ability to consent?). It's just my belief that there is too much doubt for anyone to say with much confidence that he raped her. And when you consider how many people have consensual drunken sexual encounters like this up and down the breadth of the country every weekend it's scary to think you could go to jail and it be seemingly impossible to clear your name.

I think I made my point clearly above but to reiterate I'm not saying I believe he didn't rape her and I know there can be a certain amount of doubt in any conviction I'm just saying that in my opinion given all the evidence of what happened before they entered that hotel room their story sounds as plausible as the notion that she was too drunk to consent and was raped. And I think a lot of people would agree with me if they read through the info.

So it's a bit rich for The Guardian to demand ""freedom of expression"" in mocking Muslims when The Guardian would bay for blood of anybody who mocked blacks or Asians.

The truth is we're in an awful mess in Europe - where we've encourage mass immigration from incompatible cultures and then forbidden any dissent or mocking. We don't have freedom of expression.

The south in the 1980s compared to now is a very different country with (mostly) a good infrastructure and less reliance on the state. People down south are better paid than we are by a significant amount; IT people are much better paid, even people working in charities are on double the wage we are for the same job (often from the same cross border employer). The welfare safety net is sometimes better than ours, sometimes worse, depending on the specific issue - as far as I'm aware their dole is better than ours yet the cost of living outside Dublin is not massively higher than we have for every-day things. The big problem in the south is housing prices and additional taxes, moreso than anything else. Its economy became unstable because of the lack of regulation and lending culture, this is less of a problem in NI.

null,false,KuzStuna,null,null,null,"I will start us off. We play chelsea as our 3rd last match away.

Chelsea are in a tight title chase with man city and are a  2 points ahead and in form to beat their last few opponents.  John Terry,  the sweetheart captain of chelsea, says before the match that chelsea will not slip up like Liverpool last season and will beat man city.

Chelsea get an early lead in our match from a corner (obligatory) and sit back to defend their lead. They earn another corner but this time mignolet punches it out and the ball lands to matic. Henderson presses matic into passing the ball back to Terry who stayed behind on the corner but the pass is too heavy.  It floats over John's head who tries to stretch a leg at it but falls backwards.

Gerrard chases the ball back and becomes 1on1 with Courtois who runs out of his box only to be nutmegged by Stevie who puts the equaliser in.

Liverpool are now under orders from Brendan to park the bus and counter against a chelsea side that can only beat City on points not GD.

In the last minute of the game Liverpool have a corner and mighty skrtel headers the goal on target only to be saved by a lovely stretched arm...from who else but Terry again and the ref blows to the penalty spot.

Gerrard steps up knowing he can put the ball in not just for himself but for the honour of penaltypool. Gerrard blasts a shot in the top right which Courtois guesses right but just can't stop. 

2-1 to Liverpool.  Chelsea are about to kick and at this moment the camera switches to Rodgers who is shaking Jose's hand to leave early so he can tell his Miss the score.

No sooner do chelsea kick off does the final whistle blow and the Chelsea squad are brought down to tears.

Liverpool have now pushed chelsea down and a United loss and an arsenal draw means we rise to 3rd place and United are pushed out of the top 4 spot and seem unable to catch up this late on.",null,0,null,1420750869,null,0,false,0,cnir1jk,null,t3_2rs3x9,null,t1_cnir1jk,null,t3_2rs3x9,null,null,null,1424985895,null,31,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,31,null

&gt;

&gt;The __Glorious Revolution__,  also called the __Revolution of 1688__, was the overthrow of [King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom) [James II of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_II_of_England) (James VII of Scotland and James II of Ireland) by a union of English [Parliamentarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentarianism) with the [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic) [stadtholder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadtholder) [William III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_England) of [Orange-Nassau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Orange-Nassau) (William of Orange). William's successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his ascending of the English throne as [William III of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_England) jointly with his wife [Mary II of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_II_of_England).

&gt;King James's policies of [religious tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_tolerance) after 1685 met with increasing opposition by members of leading political circles, who were troubled by the king's [Catholicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church) and his close ties with France. The crisis facing the king came to a head in 1688, with the birth of the King's son, [James Francis Edward Stuart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Francis_Edward_Stuart), on 10 June (Julian calendar).  This changed the existing [line of succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_succession) by displacing the [heir presumptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heir_presumptive), his daughter Mary, a Protestant and the wife of William of Orange, with young James as [heir apparent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heir_apparent). The establishment of a Roman Catholic dynasty in the kingdoms now seemed likely. Some of the most influential leaders of the [Tories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory) united with members of the opposition [Whigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_(British_political_party\)) and set out to resolve the crisis by inviting William of Orange to England,  which the stadtholder, who feared an Anglo-French alliance, had indicated as a condition for a military intervention.

&gt;After consolidating political and financial support, William crossed the [North Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea) and [English Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Channel) with a large invasion fleet in November 1688, landing at [Torbay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torbay). After only two minor clashes between the two opposing armies in England, and [anti-Catholic riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Catholic_riots) in several towns, James's regime collapsed, largely because of a lack of resolve shown by the king. However, this was followed by the protracted [Williamite War in Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamite_War_in_Ireland) and [Dundee's rising in Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobite_Rising#Rising_in_Scotland).  In England's distant American colonies, the revolution led to the collapse of the [Dominion of New England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_of_New_England) and the overthrow of the [Province of Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Maryland)'s government. Following a defeat of his forces at the [Battle of Reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Reading_(1688\)) on 9 December, James and his wife fled England; James, however, returned to London for a two-week period that culminated in his final departure for France on 23 December. By threatening to withdraw his troops, William in February 1689 convinced a newly chosen [Convention Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_Parliament_(1689\)) to make him and his wife [joint monarchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_monarchs).

&gt;The Revolution permanently ended any chance of [Catholicism becoming re-established in England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_in_England_and_Wales). For British Catholics its effects were disastrous both socially and politically: Catholics were denied the right to vote and sit in the Westminster Parliament for over a century; they were also denied [commissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces\)) in the [army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_British_Army#Origins), and the monarch was [forbidden to be Catholic or to marry a Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Settlement_1701), this latter prohibition remaining in force until the UK's [Succession to the Crown Act 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_to_the_Crown_Act_2013) removes it once it comes into effect. The Revolution led to limited toleration for Nonconformist Protestants, although it would be some time before they had full [political rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_rights). It has been argued, mainly by [Whig historians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_history), that James's overthrow began modern English [parliamentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system) democracy: the [Bill of Rights of 1689](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689) has become one of the most important documents in the [political history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_history) of Britain and never since has the monarch held [absolute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy) power.

&gt;Internationally, the Revolution was related to the [War of the Grand Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Grand_Alliance) on [mainland Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Europe). It has been seen as the last successful invasion of England.  It ended all attempts by England in the [Anglo-Dutch Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Dutch_Wars) of the 17th century to subdue the [Dutch Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic) by military force. However, the resulting economic integration and military co-operation between the English and Dutch navies shifted the dominance in world trade from the Dutch Republic to England and later to [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain).

&gt;The expression ""Glorious Revolution"" was first used by [John Hampden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hampden_(1653-1696\)) in late 1689,  and is an expression that is still used by the [British Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom).  The Glorious Revolution is also occasionally termed the __Bloodless Revolution__, albeit inaccurately. The [English Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War) (also known as the Great Rebellion) was still within living memory for most of the major English participants in the events of 1688, and for them, in comparison to that war (or even the [Monmouth Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monmouth_Rebellion) of 1685) the deaths in the conflict of 1688 were mercifully few.

He had three previous convictions for blasphemy when he was prosecuted for publishing two pamphlets entitled Rib Ticklers, or Questions for Parsons and God and Gott. In these pamphlets Gott satirised the biblical story of Jesus entering Jerusalem (Matthew 21:2-7) comparing Jesus to a circus clown. He was sentenced to nine months' hard labour despite suffering from an incurable illness, and died shortly after he was released. The case became the subject of public outrage.

Also their bizarre complaint about PC language. Perhaps it's because their members keep on referring to ""negroes""?

So not necessarily a right wing move. 

Arguing against universalism (i.e. free school meals) isn't left wing: http://reidfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/The-Case-for-Universalism.pdf 

The SNP's support for universalism is probably their most redeeming characteristic: 

&gt;Moving from universalism to selectivity increases social and economic inequality and
diminishes rather than enhances the status of the poor 

On the living wage 
&gt;and who shot down Scottish Labour's attempt to have a commitment to the ""living wage"" as a requirement for landing any Scottish Government contracts.

Is pretty stupid way to put it, they were given legal advice that the Scottish Government would be likely breaking EU law by trying to enforce the policy:http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27386503

&gt;who are completely silent on the 50p tax band in Scotland after the Smith Commission
