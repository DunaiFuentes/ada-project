£222Bn spent on ""Social Protection"", which is basically the bulk of the Welfare State (£31Bn on social services and £140Bn on healthcare count as 'the welfare state' too I suppose).

Thus, as the argument goes, simply handing everyone £x per week without any means testing or bureaucracy surrounding it is more affordable than actually administrating a benefits system that grants you money based on actual need.

I'd assume the Greens plan for ""more to pensioners and less to kids"" is one in one out: pay 50% to kids and 150% to pensioners, or something. 

There are about 12 million people on a State Pension right now and about 10 million under the age of 18, so it roughly works out. Maybe 25% to kids (£18/week) and 150% to pensioners (£108.6, down from the current £113.1) .

More funds will come from higher corporation taxes. The idea is to force the wealth creators to share more out. Eventually, most people won't need to work because so much of creation will be automated, needing only a small number of people to run it.

If you're more interested there's /r/basicincome and /r/futurology, two subreddits that routinely discuss and explore ideas like this.

The oft-presented counter-argument is that with free healthcare already provided, two adults will get £7,529.6 a year tax free. The cheapest 1 bed flat I can find in my area is £325pcm, leaving them £302.5 a month. Some people would be happy either not working at all, or working part time studenty jobs and hours, for the rest of their life. £300 plus £400-800 from working 8-16hrs each on minimum wage would do two people who don't have much imagination for life. The argument is unconditional income gives the lazy the boost they need to slide by doing almost nothing. 2 people can live on £1,100 a month, but not so much on £800.",null,0,null,1421621629,null,0,1421622153,0,cnt7xmr,null,t3_2sucdt,null,t1_cnt7xmr,null,t3_2sucdt,null,null,null,1424804097,null,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10,null

You do realize stupid shit makes it to the front page of our sub daily.  Circle jerk ""upvote party"" threads, or ""Drunk Pre-math threads"".  They all suck and I can't believe people upvote them, so I usually always pipe in with a comment like mine. 

Just for the record, I do have the authority to remove stupid ass stuff from the subreddit, but luckily we have a pretty lax moderation policy in this subreddit.  So what users want, users get.  If you want stupid gooner karma whoring, you can post it without the mods getting all heavy handed, but I will pipe in talking about how stupid it is.

You're making the same sort of assumptions and judgements about me that you have a problem with me making about Steven Fry; why does your imprecation of basically, ""mind your own business"" not turn itself around and focus itself back on you?  It should, if you really believed it.  

If you really felt as though it were wrong or fruitless to ruminate over the inconsequential aspects of others' lives you'd similarly be unmoved by my musings and would ignore them.  Instead, fake moral outrage, which is silly.  

Why shouldn't I stop speculating about the private lives of someone on screen?  Because I'm a free person with a computer on a toy website where people say things of no consequence and because I have absolutely no reasonable expectation that the object of my speculation will read what I say and so I don't in the slightest worry that my words will mean anything to any concerned party and so I just say them because writing about various topics on the internet is a pass time and to write for writing sake.

Then, use your credit card instead of cash or your debit card. Keep close track if what you're spending (use online banking or their app). Do NOT go over the credit limit.

At the end of the month, your credit card provider will take everything it is owed from your bank via Direct Debit. You won't pay any fees or interest. 

DO NOT MISS A SINGLE PAYMENT. Otherwise you'll be stung by high interest, fees, and black marks on your credit report.

If a lorry passes underneath them, the excessive wind pushed infront of the cab results in an uncontrolled tumble into the body of the lorry, causing the ultimate demise of the bird.

null,false,grotesquelyuglyfreak,flair7,,null,"Most of those players were ones which we weren't able to fit into the first team, and half of them caused us more hassle than were worth. Only three of them actively improved our side, with two having a couple of successful years within our team before losing their way.

Comolli joined in 2005. In 2005/06 season we had a net spend of £17.8m, 2006/07 £23.8m, 2007/08 £34m. Leaving in 2008. During that period he brought in 3 players who would excell for us, and a load of others who would weigh down the wage bill for years never having any decent impact in our side. There was some talent coming in and out the doors, but his job isn't to scout (that's the scout's job) but to work with the manager to decide whether players will fit into the team. It's not like he spotted this unheard of talent modric and brought him to spurs, the guy had just rocked the euros, he was on a lot of radars and we were very fortunate to get him.

Many of the players he brought in were out a few years later because they couldn't fit into our side, had attitude issues or mentally incapable. This is because comolli is hugely into football statistics, using them to identify targets extremely heavily, and as a result players like Downing and Bentley appear good because of the number of crosses they deliver but the mental side of the game is ignored. Downing has confidence issues, Bentley too cocky and lazy, Dos Santos too much of a party animal, Taraabt poor work ethic, Gomes' mental state, KPB's arrogance.

Whilst there were a few diamonds, there was a fuck ton of rough, and the whole process cost us a net £70m+.

I am very surprised at the support for Comolli given the money spent during his years here, it's only after he left that the books began to be balanced. During his time as DoF our net spend was quite considerable.

This wasn't really meant as a post about DoF's, of which I haven't got a huge problem with, as long as they're the right man for the job.

&gt; I am of the opinion that Comolli was the best thing that happened to Spurs in recent history, firing him was the stupidest thing we did, and Baldini is a pale imitation.

They're starting to release village boundary land for housing use but only big companies can afford to buy the land. Individual plots of what little is left in and around my village go for £250,000 easily. 

My point being, if that land had even a slight chance of getting planning permission, then they'd have sold it for ten times the amount that it cost them to put up the illegal house. They obviously knew that there's no point even applying for any kind of permission, and just went for it anyway, hoping that no one reported them. Best case scenario, if they could have proved that they'd been living there for a number of years, they could have got retrospective permission. But seeing as we're hyper-nosy around here, that's hardly ever possible.

I don't blame them for trying. Absolutely everyone's at it. I live in a cabin (albeit a legal one) because there's absolutely no way I could afford to buy a house, or even rent one now. Housing has skyrocketed, the jobs are low-paying. Chronic shortage of housing whilst half of the county consists of second homes that are empty nine months of the year. In the summer, many people live in their gardens in a cabin/caravan and rent their houses out, too.

A family member worked in the planning department for many years. They have to enforce what they're told to enforce, but they won't touch 'gypsies' (not actual Roma, but the don't like paying tax, etc kind) so they're pretty much left to do what they want, which can be pretty infuriating. They can have a whole estate up (plus electricity and sewage lines) over a bank holiday weekend (when Planning is closed). 

Most of the dodgy shit comes at councillor level. Village councillors who are related to half of the people applying, etc. They can stir up an awful lot of shit and get Planning involved in no time. I wonder who these guys pissed off, because there'll be plenty who have gotten away with the same thing that they've tried.

Sometimes I get a bit disillusioned by players. We put up with some pure embarrassment yesterday, yet fans were still there for a good few minutes after the game signing at the top of their lungs in support and encouragement for the next game. These are the people who are paying % of their income per year to follow the club, while he has *already* had a good chunk of his wage for the contract paid out in the form of a sign-on fee in order to keep his weekly in line with our general wage structure.

He's mugging us right off here, never mind the football side of it. It's all good and well saying promises haven't been kept but how did he expect to break into the team over Bony and Sigurdsson in the form they were in? Now he's basically got his name embossed on the team sheet and he is still giving it out. It's not about football for him, it's either that he reckons he's due a bigger wage (again, never mind that sign-on fee!), or he wants the London lifestyle.

Basically, I'm not in the mood for it. Fuck him out the window if that's his attitude. I support the club but it seems there's never a lot of players who are actually a part of it. People like Dyer, Routledge and Rangel might not have been in top form in the last few weeks but at least they don't fuck us about.

 Losing Bony, dealing with injuries and being crushed by Chelsea is enough to contend with for our squad morale. We've played at our best when our squad chemistry and morale was highest. Gomis' being a diva isn't going to help anything.

How this completely inept, underperforming waste of potential thinks that he should EVER start over Bony is beyond me. Set the value at 10m and given the interest someone will bite. With 40m lets invest in some players with something to prove as has been so successful for us.

While it isn't ideal to lose our two best strikers in one window, I fear for team morale more than anything. Last season got dangerous for us near the end because in squad drama. I value squad harmony very highly and despite his obvious talent, Gomis' 2 goals (really only 1) in 16 league appearances has done nothing to warrant us putting up with this shit.

It needs clear set regulations which should effectively be as transparent as possible to the average road user. Without devolving into absurd levels of bureaucracy, the profits in relation to revenue gains, and where these profits go in relation to upkeep of the road network should be freely available and published to the public. 

In an age of privatization of previously nationalised services, the public should be able to choose and dictate the standards they wish to see, especially if they're going to be paying for it. ~~None of this silly bollocks about an agreement between the secretary of state and private companies for road investment strategies, the people who are using it should have a say in what they want to see in a manner that is reflected in correspondence throughout planning, development, and execution. Currently that isn't fully reflected in the Bill, and personally I doubt it ever will be. Until it is, I personally will not be supporting it.~~ Edit - read section 8 regarding the watchdog, however only time will tell its effectiveness. While I doubt it would stop tolling, it is at least a way of limiting anything that the SHCs put into play which may adversely affect the quality of highways and related aspects (e.g. economy/environment), however I would still like to see information in relation to profits and how it is reinvested into the promotion of the highways, given back to the public.

edit 2 - I'm also going to have to look further into the 'Petroleum and geothermal energy in deep-level land' section considering the impacts this has for fracking, and that on the surface it seems to give free reign to allow for fracking in the UK under the 1998 Petroleum Act. While current strategic environmental assessments should cover them as the primary tool of assessment, that tool in itself isn't perfect and thus the environmental impacts (revolving around everything from air quality, to water quality, to noise, vibrations, earthquake risk) may not be adequately considered to the degree that they should be, when consideration to internationally established impacts is given.

Essentially the basic problem is that the motorways are shit, they're inefficient, crowded, and what starts as major motorways will devolve into smaller areas, and smaller areas. Monitoring and control of local specific issues becomes to burdensome for the watchdog, corners are cut by the SHCs to save money, and no matter what happens the member of the public gets screwed.

It's a system based on the premise of honesty, co-operation, and corporate social responsibility that *should* look out for the consumer first, and filter profits back into the system for further growth. However, colour me jaded and pessimistic, in reality I don't see it happening, although I would love to be proved wrong.

At a guess, the reduction is probably close to pound for pound.  If you're receiving £80/week in Housing Benefit it's likely that you'd need a bit more than sixteen hours extra work per week to cut even.

A couple of things that you might want to consider:    

a.  If there's little to nothing in it you might be able to use the time looking for better or more stable work, or undertaking some training that might lead to something better.  This might be a better option than working for no net benefit.    

b.  Many employers have a zero hours mentality where if you're asked to work hours outside your scheduled hours (Thursday to Saturday as you suggest) and you refuse they might decide to punish you.  You should consider whether this is a risk to you.

null,false,TiocfaidhAllah,irish,Covent Garden,null,"The Irish as a whole voted for Ireland to be a free sovereign nation. The British divided the North, an area where they forcibly removed the native Irish and replaced it with planters from England and Scotland previously so it is no surprise that this area would had a large support for British Unionism given that the natives were either starved, killed or sold off into slavery. Have a look at 1916, 1918, 1921, 1922 on Wikipedia for some insight into Irish history. Indeed a very interesting time as the rebellions in Ireland were very seen as catastrophic for the British Empire, Ireland often seen as a thorn in the side of the British Empire which encouraged many political liberation movements worldwide to take off. 

No, I'm happy to have these discussions. Most Irish people don't even take this much of interest these days!

Yes that is the view that is put forward, and as explained above there is a reason for it. If you expel a native population and then replant it with a different nationality loyal to you, or indeed the same nationality as the one who is occupying then it is likely going to result in strongholds that are loyal. Today in the North there is a lot of division, much more than there was thirty years ago. There are now more 'Peace Walls' in the North than there ever has been before. It just goes to show how the so-called Peace Process has failed despite the British and Irish Free State government saying the opposite.

Yes, the liberation of Ireland is of utmost importance to me and all Irish Republicans. In recent years there has been some revisionism on the IRA and their campaign, some like to pretend the IRAs mission was to bring civil rights to the Irish population living in the North. This couldn't be further from the truth, the IRA are a liberation movement.

I don't believe a peaceful solution exists other than false sovereignty which is what we see in the Irish Republic (Free State) today. Yes, I believe there is no doubt armed conflict is inevitable - a lot now in British and Irish media are burying their heads in the sand saying that the Republican movement doesn't posses the capability. The numbers are still there, the weapons are still there, the support base is getting bigger, more and more people are becoming disillusioned with the so-called 1998 Peace Process, both sides Republican and Loyalist.

I'm not bloodthirsty, but I do believe armed struggle to be the only viable way in which Ireland can truly be liberated. The negotiation table as proven will result in nothing. The modern IRA, from the 70s onwards which what most know of the IRA did not set out for violence, their bombing campaign was not targeted towards British civilians, sure some got killed, but that was never the intention. It's 2015 now, times have changed and I'd say from my analysis that the next full scale armed struggle might very well be the most bloody of them all unfortunately.

I do feel it is important to mention that the Republican movement has many political ideologies under one umbrella, mostly though the groups have differing degrees of socialist beliefs. The liberation therefore in the eyes of most Irish Republicans does not cease with the removal of the British but is complete when the State itself is entirely sovereign and this means unshackled from the constraints of the banking cartels. 

Most Republicans will be followers of James Connolly, and a quote that is often used is this:

""If you remove the English army tomorrow and hoist the green flag over Dublin Castle, unless you set about the organisation of the Socialist Republic your efforts would be in vain.""

A favourite quote of mine, and that one that I believes captures the ideology of Irish Republicanism is:

""There can never be peace in Ireland until the foreign, oppressive British presence is removed, leaving all the Irish people as a unit to control their own affairs and determine their own destinies as a sovereign people, free in mind and body, separate and distinct physically, culturally and economically.""

I'd also like to briefly add the conflict in Ireland is not religious and never has been. All over the world conflicts are painted as sectarian too take away legitimacy for the actions of the movement. While many immediately think of Catholicism and Protestantism when you mention ""Northern Ireland"", Irish Republicanism has never been about this - most Irish Republicans are of course Catholic (although today, I'm sure many would only be ethically), but the founding fathers if you will of Irish Republicanism were Protestant.

Lets take this a step further though, a can of Coke is 355 ml. The most reliable figure I could find for amount of water a adult male should drink a day was 3 litres. So thats 14.08 (rounded) cans a day, if they drink nothing but coke and get no hydration from anything but coke. At that rate, assuming no variance in amoutn drunk per day, and rounding the cans per day to 14 (for simplicity's sake), it would take 493.71 days of consecutive, only coke drinking. Thats a bit of a tall order even for a American!

It's like the number of suicides that people never hear about, because that kind of stuff just doesn't make the news because it's not unusual.

I ran into this phenomenon while at work just over a year ago. Some drunk guy fell asleep with his legs hanging over the railway tracks right on the platform at the railway station, most likely thinking he was on a bench. Train came along and ploughed right through him.

Didn't even make the papers.

Middle aged person goes missing after a night out drinking? Not even news nowadays.

Salicylic Acid is a Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA) that works to unclog pores and shrink acne. With most skin types it's a good place to start acne busting.

We try not to be prescriptive in SCAUK (we're not doctors!), but we have a [Beginner's Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/beginners) to help you build a routine, and if you look in the sidebar you'll see our [AHA/BHA](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2lo783/the_aha_bha_reviews/) review topic of products posters here have reviewed. We've also got a wiki of [Beneficial Ingredients](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/ingredients) you might want to have a look at too!

For a product to be an exfoliator, it needs to be at the right pH and the right %, so for example my favourite BHA Neutrogena's Spot Stress Control is packaged as a matte moisturiser, but it's at the right pH and % to exfoliate. A product with a BHA in it that's at the wrong pH &amp; % can still provide positive benefits. 

For example, my Eucerin Toner has 2% Lactic Acid so it isn't at the right % to exfoliate. But, I can still benefit from it as when used at concentrations of 2% or less, Lactic Acid will perform;  pH regulating, antimicrobial, and moisture binding functions.

null,false,TiocfaidhAllah,irish,Covent Garden,null,"Definitely that is the issue today in Republic. With regards to British influence, it's certainly there, most Republicans would say the British have successfully breed a class of Irish people to take their place ensuring the Anglo-Saxon doctrine is enforced. There was a lot of concern Ireland could've turned into a European Cuba, right on the doorstep of Britain.

Of course. I regard the European Union to be an oppressive force which has ruined the lives of millions who are not essentially bonded labour travelling around Europe forced to work low paid jobs because the EU has caused industry in their countries to collapse.

With Warrington, while of course I view it as regrettable, a warning was given as was the case for most bombs. It was not the intention to kill innocents, if that was the case the IRA wouldn't phone warnings, they could've killed tens of thousands if that was the agenda.

What you view as criminality has always been prevalent in the Republican movement and the majority of worldwide liberation movements. Most funding came from those donating and bank robberies. Yes, business that were deemed to be exploiters of the working man paid a tax for this, beatings were given to anti-social people (in fact Belfast had one of the lowest crime rates in Europe due to the self policing in both communities at this period of time). Drugs were never part and parcel until recently, support of the community in the 70s/80s was very important and it just wouldn't have worked. Loyalist paramilitaries were actually given a free reign by the British intelligence services to drug deal, in fact it has been suggested that they encouraged them to flood Republican communities with them. I'm a realist and it wouldn't possible for the Republican movement to exist without the funding - and there aren't many ways to get it. Today, it has been claimed drugs are being sold by Republican groups, it really is more of a case that they extort drug dealers forcing them to give them a percentage (very high, sometimes all their cash). This has caused a war in Ireland in recent years with a lot of gangland style executions and feuding (look at Alan Ryan for an example).

I have no problem personally with the tactics of the IRA nor the ways in which they fund their activities. Today, there is a lot feuding, a lot of spies working within and pettiness which is only damaging the movement in a way that the British State would be rubbing their hands at. Just to prove how ridiculous it has got, you now so many groups I even struggle to keep up:

Sinn Fein
,Provo IRA (still active believe it or not)
,Official IRA
,Real IRA
,Continuity IRA
,Republican Sinn Fein
,Real Republican Sinn Fein
,Continuity Sinn Fein
,INLA
,RNU
,Eirigi
,The IRA
,Óglaigh na hÉireann
,32CSM
,RAAD (Republican Action Against Drugs)

I'm missing some off but that just shows how broken up the movement is today. There's weapons all over the country, from AK47s to extremely advanced RPG styled weapons.

Interestingly too which is something that may be of interest to you is the claims of the IRA in English organised crime. There's a lot of links to infamous English gangsters (Noonan family, Clerkenwell crime syndicate etc.) Some have claimed that the drug trade in Liverpool is now overseen by elements of the IRA. Some have suggested they get a free reign from the British security services in return for putting their political/military cause on hold. Much like the Corsicans in France, the FLNC is practically given immunity in return for this. For me, this is part and parcel of the struggle, without funding you cannot get anywhere. In all honesty the movement currently is a bit of a loose end, a lot of the factions now are headed by what would a decade ago be seen a middle men, a lot of those that possessed the leadership qualities have moved on either to crime (as can be seen all over Europe, including an ex-IRA gang assisting Cosa Nostra (Mafia) to Spain where they extort drug dealers alongside Russians) or they joined Sinn Fein for a nice cushy position. There's no doubt there are elements which are of course damaging in the sense that they are not contributing to the movement, instead lining their own pockets. But these types don't last long and often will be court marshalled and shot. That's the reality, probably won't even be court marshalled to tell you the truth.

That being said, if certain promises were made upon his signing, and they were not kept, I can understand him being upset. Granted, Bony and Siggy were in incredible form, and playing two up top doesn't fit our time tested system, which I genuinely believe he does understand. You may recall that, before signing, he was already in talks with Newcastle - if he had wanted to go to a bigger team for the money, he could have. And while money is certainly a factor, how do you get more money? Play more. And in terms of a career, the chance to start for a BPL team is invaluable.

Speculation aside, I'd like to remind everyone that several members of the squad and Monk have praised Gomis as the hardest worker in training, and someone they believe in. He hasn't had a whole lot of playtime, and the squad have yet to adapt to the type of link up play he likes. While I am unsure as to whether he is the franchise striker we're looking to replace Bony in leading our line, and I would still like to see us being some serious young talent, but I think we ought to give him until the summer, at the least.

Neck and forehead suggests haircare products as a culprit. Also read the ingredients on dental care products and shaving products if male - drop anything with drying alcohol, as well as the ingredients listed above. [And definitely no aqueous cream.] (http://www.eczema.org/aqeous)

The foaming surfactants I mention above are known to irritate thin and damage *even healthy skin* at concentrations as low as 1-2%. However my elbow patch was triggered by shampoo *bubbles* running down my arm; I have been free of almost all foaming cleansers and free of eczema nearly four years.

**Secondly what is your diet and lifestyle like?** Do you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle? Various nutrients can be linked to immune dysfunction/ allergies/ histamine intolerance/ skin barrier health. I work in lifestyle healthcare and I rarely see a new client who knows what all the guidelines are, let alone follows them.

Particularly consider the intake of oily fish (up to four servings a week), whole eggs, seeds like pumpkin and chia. Avoid or massively limit sugar, processed/ refined or high glycaemic index carbohydrates, alcohol, smoking.

**Find the causes/ triggers and root them out.** Moisturisers are an important part of self care in eczema and in sensitive skin but they are not a cure nor will they reverse the effects of something else in your skincare routine, life or diet that is a major trigger. Neither will most topicals a doctor can prescribe, even fairly strong corticosterolds. Even if you have some form of dermatitis and not atopic eczema they are all the same family of skin conditions so there is more commonality than differences. 

Products to consider far as moisturisers include CeraVe cream in the tub or regular pump lotion (Amazon), Flexitol hand balm or foot cream (can be used on body), the Eucerin urea products (face way nicer than body line IIRC). These supply ceramides, lanolin and/ or urea - all of which proven beneficial in dry and eczematous skin.",null,0,null,1421642442,null,0,1421643189,0,cntj3z1,null,t3_2sscr2,null,t1_cntj3z1,null,t3_2sscr2,null,null,null,1424798676,null,3,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,3,null

I just don't see us finishing fourth. To get 70 points, we'd need to earn 35 points out of 48 - and that is a big ask. That leaves room for three losses and two draws. I think the odds of us losing fewer than four games over the rest of the season are fairly long, and the chances of us drawing fewer than at least a few games (say three) are also fairly low. We still have to play Arsenal, Chelsea, Spurs, City, Southampton, and United, not to mention West Ham and Everton (who might be shit, but will turn up for the derby). I honestly think that a reasonable expectation for those eight games is 3 wins, 2 draws, and 3 losses. That's 13 dropped points right there, which caps our season total at 70 assuming we don't fuck up *at all* anywhere else.

I don't mean to be a killjoy, and I'd be over the moon if the team proves me wrong, but I just don't think some of the expectations in here are realistic. We should watch this season with (ugh) an eye to the future, given how young and unfamiliar our squad is. I'm as excited to watch Markovic, Can, Sterling (whom I hope to god we can keep around over the summer), Moreno, Sakho, and Balotelli (yes, I think he has a lot of room to grow) develop as I am to see the team win games.

So no, it absolutely isn't the way I want us to play, as I think we could fix this without spending much money at all. Players such as Chadli and Lamela are clearly talented players, but they just don't work for every game and that's okay, as few clubs have two wingers who work in every single game in every single scenario. But we just need one more option of pace, aggression, and confident dribbling trickery to open up some of these scenarios. I also think we need a midfield alternative to Mason, as not only are we extremely poor at getting the ball forward quickly enough when he's out, but we could use a more aggressive player there centrally there anyway to physically move the ball forward. I think Delph for cheap this January would be an excellent solution to this problem.

So small outlay, and I think we could improve tremendously in terms of our annual point haul to get *away* from this way we're forced to play because we lack the right tools, regardless of our quality.

It seems to me there are some players who are too ingrained into keeping possession to allow quick passing. Dembele springs immediately to mind. He is an excellent player, but he cant pass forward, ever. He will without fail, dribble through the middle while the opposition defence takes position, draw two midfielders off, then pass sideways or backwards. 

It seems we are often too afraid of losing possession to try the quick balls forward, but in the rare times when we do we can often get those magical 3-4 one touch passes and we seem much more dangerous in the final third. 

We have some very adept players who can run the ball through one line of defence, but not through two.

Its frustrating at times to watch 80 minutes of passing sideways in front of a parked bus.

null,false,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,null,"I have posted about Everton at length elsewhere, but it really is down to a number of factors:

Firstly, the most obvious one is injuries and general fitness levels. 

Since Moyes has gone we have lost our entire fitness team- most notable both our chief doctor (just gone) and Steve Tashjian, our head Fitness Coach (and head of Sports Science)- but a lot more than that. He was Moysies right hand man when it came to performance data and analysis, and he was just as at home on spreadsheets as he was on the training pitch and creating regimes. Allegedly he and Martinez have different views on fitness, so he went over the summer, and we have suffered because of it. 

If we look at the problem in isolation, you can see the issues. We came out of the block all guns blazing in the season opener against Leicester, only to die in the second half and get pegged back- then same story against Arsenal in the next game. Dominate, go 2 up, then blow it due to no fitness and poor concentration. 

This continued, and was expanded with us losing a number of really key players. If I gave a list of our top 10 first team outfield players in the second half of last year they would be (in order of importance) McCarthy, Baines, Coleman, Mirallas, Barkley, Lukaku, Stones, Jags, Barry, Naismith. 

All but Baines have had injuries that have kept them out for multiple games, and McCarthy, Mirallas, Barkley and Stones have had injuries keeping them out for more than a month. 

[Aside] - Our pre-season was a fucking mess. I said it at the time, and it has come true. We played 1 game at home all pre-season, and that was against Porto in a testimonial- the rest were away games, none of which we won- and a bit over a week before the start of the season included a sponsor funded trip to Thailand, to get beaten by Leicester who we were to play in the second game of the year. 

Whoever was responsible for that mess should be shot. 

---

So that covers fitness, which is a big issue- but perhaps an even bigger problem is how the players are mentally. As I say, we came flying out of the blocks, but got the wind knocked out of sails by better conditioning and better concentration, this seems to have knocked our confidence. 

We try to play a system where we keep the ball, fair enough- but last year players were doing that, whilst taking risks. If Baines is overlapping on the left, and McCarthy has it right middle- last year we would have seen a straightforward crossfield diagonal to his feet... This allowed Baines to run at the box or cross the ball early. Lovely, catches the defence off guard and was a move that got us 15+ goals.

This year, same situation- McCarthy (or whoever has it, I am not picking on him really... He has actually been one of our best players, just was the first name that came to mind) passes short to barry next to him, who passes short to Mirallas, who passes short to Baines, in this time the defence has their bank of 4 setup lovely and the cross hits the perfectly positioned centrebacks head.

Long story short- confidence (or the lack of) has stopped us from showing creativity. It seems like the lads are not willing to run the risk of ever losing the ball, and it leads us to losing the ball a hell of a lot more. As a Chelsea fan, you will know how effective risky 50% balls into dangerous areas can be, because you have destroyed teams time and again with them all year... We play none of them. 

This is clearly a system issue, I think Martinez might be overemphasising short ball and it has got into the players heads, but we are beginning to see some change. 

There was a story about Lukaku last week saying that the players have asked Martinez if they can play more direct at times, and he seems to have embraced it in our play. You see, Lukaku is an anomaly- he is much more of a Michael Owen than a Didier Drogba- he is a pacey striker who does his good work running at goal, he is just stuck in a target mans body. Not a problem in a fast breaking team, but with us he has been forced into a targetmans role, holding up the ball and distributing play... He just isn't very good at it, however he is improving (after working closely with Big Dunc since the summer), but it will take at least a year longer before he can really do it at a PL quality level.

With our slow build up, he would be making a run, and the time the ball gets into the final third he is in no mans land. Over the last 2 games though, it seems like we are playing a bit more direct, and he has actually been fantastic... At least as good as last season. 

The hope from fans is that this continues, we carry on putting hard pressure on and breaking quick when needed. We can have the slow, possession based philosophy, but without the quick moments- there is no spark (and no goals).

I think Martinez is a good manager, we have the odd doomsayer, as every club does- but there is absolutely no pressure from the true support of the club (and the board), and we have faith that he is the right man to take us forward.

Isn't that why watching Spurs trying to move the ball out of midfield about as painful as watching a homeless man with diarrhea cross the street? The lack of quality in the midfield is telling, really. I love our youth, but depending on a twenty year old that started out new last year and an injury prone twenty three year old to get anything done shows how horrendous our options are. 

I totally agree with your point about us having a choice, but beyond Mason and Bentaleb, Paulinho and Dembele seem to hold on to the ball too much. There's also a lack of wanting to ""kill off"" the opposition in the final third. Whenever we get high on the left flank (our most lethal part of the pitch, IMO) for example, Chadli, Eriksen and Rose (to some extent, Kane as well) all want to seem to pass it back and fourth to each other to try to create some space. *Just take the shot*.

The reality is that whilst you're saving a lot over a short term, the interest difference is going to be pretty meaningless.

Using [MSE's calculator](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/savings-accounts-best-interest#savingscalculator) and inputting a desired £20,000 final amount in two years, with a starting amount of £7,500 and an interest rate of 3% (assuming basic rate tax) you get this:

&gt; To have £20000 in savings after 2 years and 0 months, you should save £493.27 a month.

By opening a Lloyds club(4% on £5,000), TSB (5% up to £2,000) and Nationwide Flex Direct (5% up to £2,500) you would be earning 4.5% AER on that lump of £9,500, and 3% on the remainder if directed to a Santander 123 account.

The extra 1.5% AER on the £9,500 represents about £230 additional interest over just sticking it all in Santander. Certainly useful but significantly less than a month's additional saving.

Personally, in your shoes I would probably open a First Direct account (£125 opening bonus and 6% AER regular saver up to £300 per month), max out the regular saver, and deposit the rest (and your lump sum) in a Santander 123 account. Reasonable return for minimal effort.

edit: Seems he claims he took of an endowment mortgage and the bank flipped it to interest only. The bank says there is no record of any endowment mortgage. No idea as to the truth on either side, but it should be resolvable if Mr Crawford produced his original mortgage arrangement documentation showing the endowment.

* Method of replication (does the fund own the underlying securities, a representative sample of them, or just derivatives promising to pay the return of the index?)
* Stock lending policies (If the fund does own the stock, does it lend it out for a fee? If so, how much if any of this is returned to the investors?)
* Structure (is the fund UK-domiciled? Is it an OEIC or an ETF?)

Those are the main areas we consider when comparing trackers. I'm sure there are other things I've missed.

The publicly available data on lots of these areas is pretty opaque. Hargreaves Lansdown publish some research which is a good starting point for people who can't just call up the investment house and ask the questions.

**edit:**

[Hargreaves Lansdown explain some of the above here](http://www.hl.co.uk/funds/index-tracker-funds/knowledge-centre)

[Some of the information is available here too, in table form](http://www.hl.co.uk/funds/index-tracker-funds/view-index-tracker-funds)

Take their recommendations with a pinch of salt, but it's a good place to start.

To summarise my professional research; unless you're getting a great deal lower cost, Vanguard should be the default choice. Their stock lending policy is conservative and entirely benefits unit-holders, they have the lowest tracking error across the board and they aim for full replication.

They also have economies of scale, and are run as a not-for-profit entity, meaning that excess revenue results in lower costs for everyone.

A couple of days ago he said, """"But there is no history without titles so if we play fantastic and don't win cups no-one will remember this team."" after they had just beaten Swansea.

This to me was premeditated to both disarm the No History chant we sing and actually spin it as motivation for his team.

Then today he makes sure that everyone remembers the Gerrard slip. If he truly didn't like it and thought it was disrespectful then why bring it up on the eve of a big match against us? His only reason for doing so is to make sure that everyone remembers that slip and make that the pre-match focus.

Use the front brake for your main braking, ie slowing down from 40 to 0, and gradually release the brake as you get below about 10 or 5mph.

Do the same with the back brake but don't even bother engaging that until you're doing under 15mph.

Don't be afraid to use engine braking to help bring your speed down, personally I'll slow down that way and use the brakes just to stop me in the right place.

The idea quickly falls into trouble when the government can't afford to pay it, since it would ultimately be a commitment. Then we'd be stuck in a position where instead of being able to give *most* people that need help something, we can only give everyone that needs help too little. 

Personally I don't subscribe to the idea that mankind is headed toward a time when comparatively fewer people need to work. Infact, if you look at the trend over the last 100 years the opposite is true... more people as a proportion of those alive are in work now than was ever the case previously. My view is work has to pay, and the penalties for work-avoidance need to be relatively harsh to promote a good work ethic and an appropriate fear of unemployment. Clearly there are people who, because of their physical or mental health, will never be able to work. I have no issue with the state trying to provide them with a modest means to get by - and I feel that this should be set at something like 2 standard deviations below the mean or median wage... the product would be an amount of money that is at the lower end of what someone on an ""average"" income earns. Effectively it would mean if you were disabled you might not have the latest 40"" 4K resolution HDTV and surround sound, but you would have enough to eat, drink, have modest possessions and never have to work a day in your life.

You mention clothes but it's easy to underestimate the amount it would cost to replace them as-new.  Ditto books and the general detritus most of us amass. It all counts.

On the flip side given that total loss events are rare insurers do tend to give quite generous levels of cover so hunting around for lower levels of cover won't necessarily do much to reduce your premium.

It's important not to give incorrect information, so if you can't figure out what sort of lock you have then you should say so.

As for the desktop, I *think* you can probably include that.  To insure something you have to have what's called an insurable interest - essentially you have to be in a position where you would be out of pocket if the event you're insuring against occurred. So you can insure your landlord's furniture because you are liable to pay for it if it's damaged or destroyed.

Parent B is an utter and complete twat for invoicing parents A, which was a childish and pathetic act. If they were unhappy, which I think is fair in this case, about the situation they should have just spoken with parents A to tell them this was the case and give them an opportunity to apologise. If they then didn't apologise or even accept that they had failed to uphold their side of a social contract then parent B should have recognised their twattishness as it is and merely moved on with their life, maybe they could have even considered disregarding to invite them to further social events.

These concepts about humanity reaching abundance strike me as fanciful at best. If you actually look at the trend now compared to 200 years ago there are more people in work as a proportion of those alive now than there ever have been. Technological advances open up opportunities for new areas of employment. I really don't subscribe to this idea that one day we're all going to be put out of work by our own progress. Instead you're more likely to see a shift in the nature of employment.

Personally I think the next 20 years in the UK will be a time when benefit claimants look back at the 90s/00s as being a golden age.

Would you consider it perhaps a bit ironic to state that Belfast had a low crime rate during a period when people were being beaten, and armed struggle being funded by bank robberies etc.?

I suppose it depends on your definition of crime, as if you think banks are evil then you are less likely to see a bank robbery as such a terrible thing.

I am going to assume you see the gang stuff as a necessary evil, otherwise it just becomes a means to its own end. 

What I must admit I struggle with as regards Warrington is that the bomb was in a bin in a shopping area. I mean, there are so many targets to choose from and so I cannot quite get why the bomb was placed there. Not, at least, if you are concerned about ordinary people's lives.

Or is this again like the ""collateral damage"" that a lot of people accept in Iraq etc.? The intention was to cause terror, and the only way to do this is to put real bombs in places where they will cause people to die and if they do go off then bad luck?

It should be obvious by now that I would prefer all sides just stopped shooting and blowing each other up but I have long since come to view this as a lot to ask.

Its not just crime content insurance covers you for even as a tenant a landlord is only liable for so much that can go wrong i.e. you cause a fire by negligence it could be down to you to pay for the damage caused to the property or neighbours property and you would have to pay for all your personal effects damaged. So no contents or personal liability insurance it could be a very expensive bill you are looking at. 

Contact the landlord with regards to the door lock, Its a tricky area with security of rented premises as I believe their is no minimum standard for security a landlord has to adhere to.

How long do you think it'll take to instill in society a different ethos beyond ""Work to live""?  I'd say 30 years might be too short.  We can slowly and carefully build the framework for this system so we don't have a drastic change or huge civil unrest in the interim periods.

The main issue with the UK doing it right now is the free movement in the EU situation, but if you align it to only be provided to people with UK Passports etc that becomes manageable.

Steps in the right direction.

Its posturing, but its dumb posturing (is there any other kind? hurr hurr). The last four years has seen Cameron systematically strip away not only the welfare state but also the protections for employees in work. Its a move that can be easily torpedoed by any competent opponent (what I would give for some competent opposition!) who can simply point at his track record and say ""Really?""

&gt;I don't doubt, however, that one of Cameron's guiding stars (and I do believe he has some even if their not the same as everyone's) is a meritocratic one of 'every family working for a living'. It's one of mine if I'm honest. Honest work and productivity are good for a person's well-being. Maybe he's being sincere after all. We'll have to see.

Every family working for a living? Nepotism? ;) /s

Its a nice idea and one I'm broadly in favour of; but the employee deserves as much protection from unscrupulous employers as possible. So Cameron might well be trying to get everyone into work (for lots of reasons, like plugging the income tax hole) but whether its good work remain to be seen - we have a great problem with unskilled labour in this country and it is a problem that has needed to be addressed for the last twenty years.",null,0,null,1421665956,null,0,false,0,cntqal4,null,t3_2sx51z,null,t1_cntqal4,null,t1_cntq718,null,null,null,1424795324,null,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3,null

The thing is though, it isn't really convincing. The first argument is that Quantititive Easing didn't cause inflation so Basic Income won't either. But as has been stated elsewhere, these are two completely different things. QE didn't cause inflation because it *didn't* put extra money into people's hands. As you state, giving more money to one billionaire is not going to increase the demand for trousers, but BI is giving more money to millions of people.

Secondly the examples given for wheer a ""similar"" thing has been tried are not really on the same scale as BI. In the examples shown the income provided was nowhere near enough to live on. You can't really separate the effect of a small dividend paid to everyone from the other economic pressures on inflation. If you scale it up though the effect could well be more pronounced.

The claim that the effect on housing costs wouldn't be that great because ""there are five times more vacant homes than homeless people in the United States today"" might be relevant to the US but it certainly isn't the case in the UK.

There is also the claim that it will lead to higher wages because people will not be as dependant on their jobs with current wage levels. So if businesses are forced to pay higher wages for the same amount of labour, then where will they get the money to pay these wages? Obviously it will have to come from raising prices.

Then finally there is the claim that basic income will have to be index linked to inflation. That looks like a positive feedback situation which is only going to drive inflation even higher.

Forgive me, because there's no good sounding way in my mind to say this, but you wouldn't really know what you're talking about it here, then. If you were gay, you might've experienced the same homophobic bullying that many have. If you were gay, perhaps you'd think it's better to be bullied than segregated and othered. Wouldn't even need to be gay to see there are bullies from all genders and sexual orientations. All this would do is segregate the LGB students.

From the outside, it might be easy to say ""that will keep them away from harm"", but how would you feel if you were told because you were different, you would be taken away from your friends and placed somewhere else? It's as immutable as skin colour, would it be alright if we made ""Black schools"" to keep the blacks away from racist bullies? 

It's fortunate they only plan for support and not as they put it ""a full blown secondary school"".

Personally I think it's complete bullshit that has been [popularized on the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) but is not widely regarded elsewhere. Essentially they suggest that increases in computerization and mechanization will ultimately put people out of work to such a point that we simply have to accept that the notion of having 95% of people in work is undesirable and unachievable... and therefore have to provide for and accomodate people who do not work simply because they are alive (... blah blah blah utopia).

HOWEVER, if you actually look at the trend, more people (as a proportion of those alive) are in work now than ever before, it's simply the nature of the work that has changed. 100 years ago we wouldn't have expected women or the over 60s to work... but today we would. Certain areas may be better for machines in the long term but they might not necessarily ever be cheaper. My suspicion is we'll see people moving from industries that can be mechanised easily to those that can't... for example the days of taxi drivers might be numbered if cars ultimately go driverless... but we'll probably see more people in care-related industries which are intrinsically difficult to mechanize. Basically this whole green argument that people need a basic income is bullshit.

People need to work to eat. And if they don't work they don't eat. That is the reality of the world and that is the reality that will continue.

It's so far from the end of the world, first there's clearing which has some great courses in it. Don't just grab at anything though, if you don't know the uni would suit you you will need some speedy research skills. If you don't see anything that you are 100% on think about a year out, this may sound like the last thing you want to do but for lots of people that little gap helps lots. Get a job, doesn't matter what, if you can try to find an independent place to stay. Get out into the world and you will learn loads of the stuff that students do in their first year before you go. Loads of folk live away from home for the first time in their first year and don't cope well leading them to drop out. Giving yourself time to grow puts you at a far lower risk of this. 

Uni is the point when friends stop all being at the same stage in life. When they all graduate and hit up the daily grind that most go onto you'll have a year left of uni. They will be jealous of you not the other way around. 

Basically, relax and look at your options. There are lots of great ones out there. If you do apply for next year make sure your personal statement tells us you chose to do this (for all anyone knows you turned down offers).

I had similar issues until I did my CBT plus course, which my local council funds - I was pulling up to junctions too quickly, which meant my braking was more urgent and therefore a little bit jerky. 

Just give yourself more room to slow down with that rear brake, and as others have said, make sure you're really comfortable riding at slow speeds. You want to be able to ride at a walking pace or less with your feet up, ideally, which only comes with practice. I assume you know this, but if not, keeping the revs a little higher, holding the clutch on the biting point and using the rear brake to control speed will let you balance more easily at sub-5mph speeds. You want to hold the clutch in such a position that you're able to blip the throttle without your speed altering even slightly, because of the clutch slipping. NB: don't blip it too often because you'll hurt your clutch.

Slowing down earlier also gives you more time to check your mirrors, blind spots, sort out your road position and just to work out where you're going. The most significant change I noticed was that if you're good enough at really low-speed riding, you don't have to stop for red lights - just slow right down and you can often just keep on goin', as they'll turn green before you have to stop.

If you look at the statistics in the article, look at countries like Portugal, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Latvia, and Lithuania. There's no comparison between them and Germany and France. A guy called Del did the maths in the comments on the Facebook post and totaled it all up: ""it comes out as 29,025 UK citizens claiming benefits in these EU countries compared with 64,830 EU nationals claiming benefits in the UK."" And Ireland is surely a dodgy example because of the issues regarding citizenship and family ties in the recent past? The statistics are not proportional to the total population or total number of immigrants either.

And in it the author writes ""The figures for nationals of those 10 east European countries drawing jobseeker’s allowance in the UK remain modest, despite the periodical outcries about “benefits tourism”. There are only about 1,000 Romanians and 500 Bulgarians, for example, drawing jobseeker’s allowance in Britain, according to the Department for Work and Pensions."" But you didn't mention those from Poland or Slovakia did you? Bulgarian and Romania have not had the right to free movement of labour for even 12 months yet AFAIK! Cherry-picking to suit your own biases is undesirable whether it's in the Guardian or the Daily Fail. If you want to defeat UKIP then do it by honest means.

The article title reads that unemployed Britons in Europe take more in benefits from wealthier EU countries than their [wealthier EU countries'] nationals are in ours. Which may be true. But it ignores the wider picture of what those opposed to the current status quo are talking about, because I don't think there's any perceived problem with Germans abusing our welfare system. But, rightly or wrongly, there is a *perceived* problem with Eastern Europeans. This article is attempting to dispel that belief, but the statistics they're using *only support the case.* As I said, look at the Eastern European countries as well as Portugal.

How much of a market do you think there is for peoples creative works?  Currently its extremely small and a few make a vast quantity of money from it and the majority creating arts scrape by.

It's not just that automation is reducing the quantity of jobs, it's also putting an absolute dollar value on labor.  As soon as that value is lower for a system rather than a human, you'll see the human get replaced.

In jobs where there cannot be a replace they will work along side augmenting our skills (eg, what computers do now - allowing individual workers to be more productive)

We're both probably right to some extent.  I guess the difference is - where do you want to end up?

null,false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,null,"I have mentioned this in a previous post regarding Suso. In short, I stated that while Suso seduces us with this raw talent and potential, the fact that he is being allowed to move on suggests to me that he lacked a certain level of heart and desire that Brendan Rodgers requires.

Rodgers has always maintained that regardless of age, if you train hard you will be rewarded with the opportunity to prove yourself on matchday.

This is why the likes of Jordon Ibe has been recalled, why Raheem Sterling has been given the opportunity to play, why Jon Flanagan unexpectedly appeared in our side last season and proved himself to be a regular fixture in our side, why Markovic and Can have been given the opportunity to prove themselves, etc. etc.

Let's not forget that from the day Brendan Rodgers was brought on to lead Liverpool FC, he always maintained that he wants players who have the *mental toughness* to succeed.

Rodgers' tactical style and overall philosophy requires players to balance the idea of expressing themselves as individuals all the while working within the context of the *team*.

This is why this particular quote that I've made the title of this post is so intriguing to me. Rodgers is explicitly stating that if you work hard in training, if you have the belief, if you *want it bad enough*, you will be rewarded with playing time and given the opportunity to succeed.

Fabio Borini certainly proved that against Aston Villa.

Let's be honest here, Rodgers and the transfer committee wanted to sell Borini. They all thought Borini would be better off showcasing his talents elsewhere. And then Borini stubbornly refused to accept a transfer. As supporters it seemed as if we were divided:

* Borini isn't good enough and is a cunt for not leaving.
* Borini *is* good enough, let's give him a chance.

Frankly, Borini does not hold the potential the way Ibe or Sterling or Markovic does. It would be shocking if Borini reached the level of a Daniel Sturridge. Borini, I feel, probably *isn't* talented enough as a footballer.

However, it seems to me that Borini possesses far more mental toughness and far more heart that many players that are clearly more gifted than him.

I think a coach like Rodgers respects that.

And credit to the 23-year-old Fabio Borini; A player who has found himself at a new club, a new city pretty much every year of his career and forced to integrate himself into a new culture; A player who seems to be wanted and not wanted at the same time.

At any time, Borini could have said, 'Fuck it. I'm done' and hang up his boots or allow himself to play his part in a mid-level Serie A team in Italy.

... But he didn't.

Borini may never cement himself in LFC history. But I will always respect his heart.

Sometimes a football club isn't always about collecting the best talent money can buy. Often times you need a guy like Borini. He is a guy that realises that he will never be touted as the next so-and-so, a guy that realises that he will never be mentioned as a transfer target for Real Madrid, etc.

But from the way he plays, the way he works, the way he impressed Rodgers enough to get a game against Villa, the way he scored, the way he celebrated, you have to give Fabio Borini the utmost respect for never giving up.

And imagine his impact on the dressing room. Many other players are probably clearly aware that Borini is not as talented as them. But they certainly see how hard he works in spite of his limitations. I'd like to think that Borini's attitude encourages everyone to work as hard as Borini does.

And if Borini - and the likes of Borini - can show that inspiration then maybe mediocre players can be good, good players can be great, and great players can be legends.

Borini could have made more money and could have been more successful at a so-called 'smaller' club but he didn't. And that should serve as an inspiration for others.

Again, building a squad isn't necessarily about collecting the best talent money can buy. When you're building a squad organically the way ownership and Rodgers wants to do, sometimes you need lads like Borini, lads whose heart exceeds their talent, lads who can inspire gifted players who may have grown comfortable with their natural talent to work even harder to reach their full potential.

I've likely read too much into Borini. I likely have overestimated his heart. I have likely been seduced by Rodgers' over-optimistic mediaspeak. Hell, I still don't believe that Borini will ever be successful. However, I will believe that at the very least, Fabio Borini serves to show that sometimes raw talent isn't everything, that *persistence*, hard work, belief, can still be an inspiration for a team.

Whether Borini 'makes it' or not, he knows that his hard work has resulted in this moment.

And isn't that the sort of romanticism that makes us love football?

I think it is.

null,false,Rippsy,null,null,null,"&gt;The claim that the effect on housing costs wouldn't be that great because ""there are five times more vacant homes than homeless people in the United States today"" might be relevant to the US but it certainly isn't the case in the UK.

Yes that bit only refers to the US, but we could actually just build some more houses, and since Basic Income disconnects your life from your job, you'd probably see an exodus from the cities into smaller villages as people move to places they enjoy living rather than must live.  This will re-balance the housing market and allow building to take place in far more locations than the current city situation we have where people are forced into cities to find jobs and then forced to find housing near cities.

&gt;There is also the claim that it will lead to higher wages because people will not be as dependant on their jobs with current wage levels. So if businesses are forced to pay higher wages for the same amount of labour, then where will they get the money to pay these wages? Obviously it will have to come from raising prices.

The value of an individuals labor has been decreasing for a long time as productivity per worker increases and general skill levels decrease.  
Especially as systems exist to make jobs less complicated and require less training as well.

Once the service industry starts getting hit with the same thing (automated systems restocking shelves etc) these low skill individuals will have no where to work.

They will end up on welfare one way or the other.  The only question is in my opinion:

Do we proactively look at creating a system which provides the most benefit to society

or

Do we re-actively try and fix the situation with a piecemeal solution?

Good luck with that. We'll see how far that achieving attitude gets you. 

The reality is that in a world that already has too many people, the last thing you want to find is that you're the disposable person the world doesn't really need... far from times getting better for the out of work, disabled and ill the reality is times are about to get a lot harder. The squeeze on housing means there will be an expectation that is reflected on those out of work aswell. Whereas it might have been normal for our parents to own 3 or 4 bed detached/semi-detached or terraced housing, for our generation the norm will be 1-2 bedroom flats in apartment complexes. Standalone housing (especially detached housing of any sort) will come to be seen as a sign of considerable wealth in the years that come. Already we've seen a trend in social housing away from ""family homes"" towards shared
accommodation that is more reflective of the rental market. 

In addition, the squeezing of the middle class has meant that they are comparatively less generous than they were 15 years ago, and attitudes towards worklessness have changed considerably. There seems to be a concerted shift now towards 'in-work-benefits' which effectively subsidize those jobs that don't pay a living wage (because the market conditions and economics of that industry can't accommodate it). This is as opposed to simply supporting those out of work to sit on their arse and do nothing all day. 

I think in 5-10 years time we'll find ourselves in a position where benefits are primarily in-work only, or for those with serious and **demonstrable** disabilities (like missing limbs or severe learning difficulties). Gone will be the days of the ""hurty back"" and depression as socially acceptable causes for worklessness. I think we'll be seeing a shift from councils providing set-piece homes for families towards smaller flats or even dormitory-like accomodation for the under-25s.

And I'm not sure if either Borini or Balotelli have the versatility to succeed in Rodgers' system. Maybe they eventually can. Maybe they won't. They are somewhat mysteries to me.

However, what I can say is that I think there is an interesting *human* element that we should consider:

* Borini almost has nothing to lose: He isn't rated as highly as Balotelli, supporters aren't foolish enough to think he'd be another Sturridge or Suarez, LFC tried their best to get rid of Borini. There is far less pressure on an unassuming player like Borini. We *expect* very little from Borini and everything Borini does well is a cherry on top.
* All the while, Balotelli seemingly has *everything* to lose. A player only a year older than Borini yet because of Balotelli's raw talent he is saddled with the pressure and the *expectation* of being brilliant right away.

Think about that for a moment

* Fabio Borini is only 23-years-old (24 in March) and think about what we expect from him.

* Mario Balotelli is only 24-years-old (25 in August) and think about what we expect him to do on the pitch.

Sure, their raw ability and physical gifts are quite different, but in terms of maturity, they are quite the same.

But anyway, we've already got plenty of flooded glens here for hydro, but I reject the idea that we need to keep going the way we're going in the first place, it's not sustainable. More micro-renewables would be a good start, and a proper grid that could allow two-way transmission. There's also hydrogen fuel cells - they use a lot of energy to produce, but you can do that when there's excess capacity. There's also things like anaerobic digestion, where the gas can be stored. There's also improvements that can be made in energy storage solutions, batteries are rubbish right now, but we can improve them, and there have been a few promising steps made recently, but it needs more investment in the research. That's for dynamic. 

Also, we should be better at using all forms of energy, not just electricity. More district heating systems and the like. If you look at the way that nordic nations use their hot water, it's much more efficient than what we do. Don't let hot water cool without using it for something sensible.

For baseload, there's leaps forward in terms of tidal power for example, which is accurately predictable centuries in advance. the efficiency of solar and wind is constanlty moving onwards, and ground and air source heat pumps are slowly becoming more common.

If there _is_ money involved, we usually ask for it up-front, with a cut-off date. And we make sure that people can get in touch with us and that we can keep in touch with them, so that we don't have to resort to passing notes in our kids' bags.

For the Time Lords, this was cutting edge. Only the President was allowed full access and while minds could access it, there seemed to be no way of resurrecting the dead with it.

The Master on the other hand, is shown to have a natural proficiency for using the Matrix, accessing and altering it's systems remotely in a way neither the Doctor or the other Time Lords could manage.

- The political centre seemed unable to comprehend the idea of the welfare system being anything other than a brief respite to getting a job

- Lots of people, in the face of actual evidence, refused to believe people wouldn't just quit their jobs and sit around on the dole

&gt;Dear Chris Bryant MP,

&gt;You classist gimp. I happened to go to a boarding school. No one helped me at boarding school to get into the music business. I bought my first guitar with money I saved from holiday jobs (sandwich packing!). I was taught the only four chords I know by a friend. No one at school had ANY knowledge or contacts in the music business, and I was expected to become a soldier or a lawyer or perhaps a stockbroker. So alien was it, that people laughed at the idea of me going into the music business, and certainly no one was of any use.

&gt;In the army, again, people thought it was a mad idea. None of them knew anyone in the business either.

&gt;And when I left the army, going against everyone’s advice, EVERYONE I met in the British music industry told me there was no way it would work for me because I was too posh. One record company even asked if I could speak in a different accent. (I told them I could try Russian).

&gt;Every step of the way, my background has been AGAINST me succeeding in the music business. And when I have managed to break through, I was STILL scoffed at for being too posh for the industry.

&gt;And then you come along, looking for votes, telling working class people that posh people like me don’t deserve it, and that we must redress the balance. But it is your populist, envy-based, vote-hunting ideas which make our country crap, far more than me and my shit songs, and my plummy accent.

&gt;I got signed in America, where they don’t give a stuff about, or even understand what you mean by me and “my ilk”, you prejudiced wazzock, and I worked my arse off. What you teach is the politics of jealousy. Rather than celebrating success and figuring out how we can all exploit it further as the Americans do, you instead talk about how we can hobble that success and “level the playing field”. Perhaps what you’ve failed to realise is that the only head-start my school gave me in the music business, where the VAST majority of people are NOT from boarding school, is to tell me that I should aim high. Perhaps it protected me from your kind of narrow-minded, self-defeating, lead-us-to-a-dead-end, remove-the-‘G’-from-‘GB’ thinking, which is to look at others’ success and say, “it’s not fair.”

You'd have better luck either finding a full-time job in another sector and applying to be a Special Constable (A volunteer officer with all of the powers of a normal officer), and doing that for a while if you wanted to join any force outside of London.

For instance, a mate of mine has been a Special in the West Midlands Police for two years and hasn't been able to transfer to a full time Constable. Plus, a lot of forces have been making their entry requirements harder, and depending on your education level, more difficult to get into.

The Met is a lot easier to join compared to other forces, but the living costs of London might drag a little. Though one of the people I know online has just become a Special in the Met despite living in Cardiff.

I wish you the best of luck anyway, even if you are a little tapped for wanting to come and live here ;)

Capitalism drives progress very well, but it forgets social goals and goods entirely if they cannot be directly profitable.

BI takes this success and invests it to providing social goods which are outside the scope of capitalism.

I firmly believe one day capitalism will either wake up to the social goods delivering higher profit.  But it will have to come at the same time as understanding the requirement to not abuse the commons for individual gain.

However, while so many supporters are throwing toys out the pram because we finished second last season and are in so-called dire straits this season, I personally find encouragement in the fact that our players are still brimming with confidence even when I myself have thrown a toy or two out.

Sure, mathematically, we have a tough hill to climb.

However, I believe we have a squad of youngsters who are seemingly too naive to be negative, a boss - Brendan Rodgers - who is too stubborn and too romantic in his ways, a group of supporters who are often ridiculed by others for our smug - sometimes delusional - overconfidence.

But would I have it any other way? No.

Would I want to win titles because of a billionaire benefactor? No.

Whether Liverpool wins or loses, I'd like to think that we did it the right way. The Liverpool way. In that stubborn Northern England, working class sort of way.

I get it. We have historically been a top club and have had the benefits of global support, a strong brand, tangible success (trophies, titles, etc) and with all that comes the luxury of money. And the kind of money that is perhaps frowned upon by the likes of Everton or other so-called 'smaller' clubs.

But with all that being said, I'd like to think that while Liverpool accept and acknowledge their financial superiority, we can still strive to find a balance and do things the right way.

And doing things the so-called 'right way' is perhaps a source of why Liverpool are criticised for our sense of 'entitlement,' our seemingly annoying adherence to our 'history' and the way we manufacture folk heroes.

I always felt as if Liverpool retained a fiercely small-town culture while the city itself expanded steadily into an industrial and cultural hub of the world.

Therefore, as frustrating as recent seasons have been, isn't there some comfort in knowing that our multicultural squad embodies the spirit of this proud city? Isn't there some comfort in knowing that our American overlords with little 'soccer' knowledge still understand what football means to Liverpool? Isn't there comfort in knowing that as frustrating as Brendan Rodgers can be, he is a student of history and understands the cultural importance of being the boss of Liverpool Football Club?

I am just as frustrated as any other supporter for our position this season, our lack of regular Champions League play, our failure to secure the best of the best, etc.

But, y'know what? For the first time in a long time, I feel as if ownership *understands* what LFC is all about, I feel as if this somewhat inexperienced 41-year-old manager at the very least understands what LFC is all about, I feel as if this collection of young, raw but mentally tough players realize what it means to put on a red shirt.

This question pops up every so often on this sub: Would you rather have an oil baron own the team and pump unimaginable amounts of money into team?

Well... it'd be nice. But I don't think it would ever be as truly satisfying.

The results may not be as immediate as we want, perhaps we'll find that Rodgers isn't the right manager for us to take us to the next level, perhaps our ownership isn't right for us either... however, coming off the awful ownership of Hicks and Gillett, I'd like to think that with FSG, Rodgers and our core of young players, we have built a nice foundation going forward.

Anyway, James Blunt's hardly the real problem. The complete lack of money in the arts, apart from at the highest level, is what stops working class people fulfilling their talent and ambitions. Not to mention that there's a generally appalling level of nepotism in the arts anyway, so talent has much less to do with success than who you know/who your friends are. 

I actually think James Blunt is a likeable old sod in many ways, but he could barely be talking more bullshit if he tried: 

&gt; What you teach is the politics of jealousy. Rather than celebrating success and figuring out how we can all exploit it further as the Americans do, you instead talk about how we can hobble that success and “level the playing field”.

**Liverpool (A)** - they're on an upturn, and we've come of the back of a poor run. But we still have the capacity to hurt them. Also, their 'upturn' hasn't included any big games really. They beat burnley, swansea, drew at leicester, and beat sunderland and villa. Good, but not groundbreaking. Also, they have chelsea on tuesday, FA cup this weekend, chelsea again next mid-week THEN us. They should be feeling it - our only game in that period is Bristol City away. **DRAW** is very possible here. Would be gutted to lose.

**Man U (H)** - One of our bogey teams. The return fixture was pretty close and could see us snatching a draw (hey - we managed to break the Everton curse!), but the pessimist in me says Man U will come and beat us as usual. **LOSE**

**Southampton (A)** - This will be a massive game, could go either way depending how we both do between now and then.

**Spurs (A)** - shouldn't have lost to them on the first day, and that was before all our signings were starting. **WIN**

**Palace (H)** - should win this. Pardew's new manager glamour will have faded and these are the kinds of games the lads will now we HAVE to go grav the 3 points to keep a top 6 finish possible. **WIN**

**Chelsea (H)** - They will be rampaging towards the title at this point, and players like Costa and Hazard always open us up. **LOSE**

**Arsenal (A)** - depends if Arsenal do their usual imploding of the season at some point. Could go either way. Song with another spectacular disallowed goal?

Out of a possible 21 I can see us getting 10 potentially.

Or we don't win any of them and are sitting in the relegation zone with 9 games left?

HOWEVER... I am yet to see any statistics that actually firmly say they are less likely to claim JSA... lets assume however that you are right (and it probably does follow based on the above statistics).

Should we be surprised that fewer Poles claim benefits in the UK vs Britons?... not at all. The current wave of Polish migrants are economic migrants that came here specifically to work. Therefore they are predominantly young able-bodied working age adults (usually at the lower end of that age range). Our own population naturally contains an overhead of people who are out of work or seeking work due to ill health, disability etc. Obviously the Poles also have this... except that group are back in Poland. So you would naturally expect those statistics to be the case. It doesn't mean that they are a morally worthy group any more entitled to benefits than anyone else though.

&gt; Given they contribute more to the economy than they take out it's a non-issue then.

I don't agree with this commonly held misconception at all. The belief being that in pure numbers Poles receive less in ""welfare"" style handouts (pension, JSA, Disability allowance and UC) than they pay in as tax (NI and Income Tax). The situation isn't as simple as that... they cost money that cannot easily be counted; they cost the NHS considerable amounts - particularly in areas like maternity care, they cost schools (there are a staggering [1.3 million children](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2849618/The-hidden-impact-migration-Statistics-ignore-1-3-million-children-born-foreign-parents.html) in UK schools born to foreign parents), they cost money in Policing etc. Above all they have exacerbated a brutal housing shortage and displaced our own unskilled labour class out of their traditional areas of work. 

There is also a far darker aspect to this; which is that a lot of these people are paying into what will effectively be a UK pension but do not intend to ultimately retire here. So at the moment we pay our British retirees money to live off, which they dutifully spend domestically for food/services that gets reinvested into our own economy. In 25-35 years time when we start getting stung by these EU nationals pensions we'll be exporting our own money to other EU nations so they can retire there instead (and live a life of relative prosperity on our generous pension)... and that money will leave our own economy.",null,0,null,1421677624,null,0,false,0,cnttblt,null,t3_2sxafw,null,t1_cnttblt,null,t1_cnts1xy,null,null,null,1424793841,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

For far too long under the previous labour government the welfare state was expanded enormously and the package of welfare awarded to people was extremely generous. I think we are now seeing an appropriate adjustment to that. 

I genuinely believe that people who are out of work and could theoretically work ought to be penalised. The state should provide only the absolute minimum level of support needed to keep them alive in a life vaugely worth living. If they want anything better than that then they'll need to work... and if they lack the life skills to achieve that then its ultimately their own failing. The state shouldn't pick up the bill for it. It certainly shouldn't be the case that someone on benefits can approach the median average salary.

The banks can borrow in the wholesale market for rates below 1%, so the only reason they offer 3%, 4%, 5% on current accounts is to draw you into their ecosystem and hope to sell you an expensive product somewhere else.

You have to be diligent. A great example is the Lloyds account - they only pay the top rate if your balance is between £4,000 and £5,000. Any time it is below £4,000 and you receive 2%.

&gt; Dear James
&gt; 
&gt; Stop being so blooming precious. I’m not knocking your success. I even contributed to it by buying one of your albums. I’m not knocking Eddie Redmayne, either. He was the best Richard II I have ever seen.
&gt; 
&gt; If you’d read the whole of my interview, you’d have seen that I make the point that the people who subsidise the arts the most are artists themselves. Of course that includes you. But it is a statement of the blindingly obvious that that is far tougher if you come from a poor family where you have to hand over your holiday earnings to help pay the family bills.
&gt; 
&gt; I’m delighted you’ve done well for yourself. But it is really tough forging a career in the arts if you can’t afford the enormous fees for drama school, if you don’t know anybody who can give you a leg up, if your parents can’t subsidise you for a few years whilst you make your name and if you can’t afford to take on an unpaid internship.
&gt; 
&gt; You see the thing is I want everyone to take part in the arts. I don’t want any no-go areas for young people from less privileged backgrounds. And I’m convinced that we won’t be Great Britain if we waste great British talent in the arts. You seem to think talent will always out. My fear is that someone like Stanley Baker, the son of a disabled miner in the Rhondda, who rose to be one of Britain’s greatest film actors (Zulu), would have found it even harder to make it today.
&gt; 
&gt; That’s why we need more diversity at every level in the arts – in education, in training, on-screen, on stage and backstage – and we need to break down all the barriers to taking part so that every talent gets a chance.
&gt; 
&gt; Yours bluntly

I, like most blues on here I'd imagine, have actually been quite surprised when browsing other subs like /r/soccer and seen comments from other fans suggesting that Martinez is on the brink of leaving. As far as letting the manager get on with the job is concerned, we've got a great chairman who does exactly that, steps back and let's Roberto crack on. Unlike other trigger happy chairmen in the league Kenwright has faith that Martinez will turn a corner.

Injuries, poor refereeing, not having that bit of 'luck' needed to see some games out and the lack of a 'plan b' have been detrimental this season, but we've turned that around the past couple of games in two very spirited performances. The back four of Baines/Jagielka/Stones/Coleman seems a lot more solid now, we've got players like Mirallas and McCarthy still coming back from injury and we now seem to be applying a more direct 'plan b' when the passing game is ineffective.

Basically, I don't think he's in danger of being sacked.

I think this is the crux of our disagreement.  I forsee there to be a lack of jobs which provide a living wage in the future, we're already seeing it now with the devaluation of labor.

What if we see contraction of jobs in all sectors (as predicted) and a large portion of people are unable to get gainful employment simply because the jobs do not exist?

&gt; Dear James
&gt; 
&gt; Stop being so blooming precious. I’m not knocking your success. I even contributed to it by buying one of your albums. I’m not knocking Eddie Redmayne, either. He was the best Richard II I have ever seen.
&gt; 
&gt; If you’d read the whole of my interview, you’d have seen that I make the point that the people who subsidise the arts the most are artists themselves. Of course that includes you. But it is a statement of the blindingly obvious that that is far tougher if you come from a poor family where you have to hand over your holiday earnings to help pay the family bills.
&gt; 
&gt; I’m delighted you’ve done well for yourself. But it is really tough forging a career in the arts if you can’t afford the enormous fees for drama school, if you don’t know anybody who can give you a leg up, if your parents can’t subsidise you for a few years whilst you make your name and if you can’t afford to take on an unpaid internship.
&gt; 
&gt; You see the thing is I want everyone to take part in the arts. I don’t want any no-go areas for young people from less privileged backgrounds. And I’m convinced that we won’t be Great Britain if we waste great British talent in the arts. You seem to think talent will always out. My fear is that someone like Stanley Baker, the son of a disabled miner in the Rhondda, who rose to be one of Britain’s greatest film actors (Zulu), would have found it even harder to make it today.
&gt; 
&gt; That’s why we need more diversity at every level in the arts – in education, in training, on-screen, on stage and backstage – and we need to break down all the barriers to taking part so that every talent gets a chance.
&gt; 
&gt; Yours bluntly

But there are often not any movement around them and they have to play it sideways or backwards to keep the ball between our players. There are not many passing options avaliable to them.

A lot of the times when Eriksen is on the ball, i don't really think he is missing many opportunities. It's more like there aren't really any. How many times do we actually see a run like Chadli did a couple of times against Chelsea? Eriksen is our ""playmaker"" and he needs movement around him.

Our two CMs also offer close to nothing offensively. I think it says something about how little they offer when our best player is Mason and he is bang average. Looking at our competitors, they all have better CMs than us. Do we even have a goal or an assist from CM this season?

If we play like we did in Rome, with a similar tactical approach and defensive solidity, I think we have every chance of winning. 

Whatever there is to be said about how bad Navas was yesterday (I was there, I know), the reason he's played so much this season is that his defensive application has vastly improved.

no... it doesn't and no one ever has said this. 

Also it is clear cut that EU migrants pay in more than they receive in benefits... http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/11/05/immigration-immigrants-taxes-benefits_n_6101462.html

More people be definition means there will more need for infrastructure - (schools/NHS/Roads/Policing/housing/Etc).  This is absolutely the case but you are conflating issues.  **Given it is demonstratively proven that EU immigrations are net contributors it is a political decision to not use that money for these services, not the blame of the immigrants**.  If lack of infrastructure is a concern of yours, the solution is to vote for a party that will address this, rather than use immigrants as a scapegoat.  Hint, it's not the Tories and certainly not UKIP.  

Further, the reality is with them being net-contributors they are in fact paying for our current pensioners and without them we would have to make even further cuts to services or other costs.  Where someone retires is also separate issue, especially when you consider all the Brits in France/Spain.  You aren't about to stop their payments are you?

null,false,ir_h,flair8,,null,"Tottenham Hotspur have drawn up secret plans to build the biggest club stadium in London when they obtain a crucial piece of land that is the subject of an intense legal challenge, The Times can reveal.

In what will be seen as Tottenham trying to claim the capital's bragging rights, the club have had discussions about applying for planning permission for a 61,000-seat arena, which would be bigger than the Emirates Stadium, home to Arsenal, their rivals. It could also be used for pop concerts and American football matches.

The new design would generate considerably more income for the club and includes plans for supporters to be able to walk on the roof of the stadium and would require demolishing further historic properties, according to documents lodged at the High Court.

Tottenham were given permission to build a 56,000-seat stadium three years ago and have fought hard to keep their new plans while a fierce legal argument rages over a piece of land which is next to the Paxton Road end of White Hart Lane.

But the club were reluctantly forced to admit holding secret discussions with local government and transport authorities, which could help the owners of the land in their legal appeal against losing their site.

Archway Sheet Metal Works, the family-run business, will argue that the government's decision to issue a purchase order of their land was made on one basis, while the club had secret, different plans for the site. The High Court appeal hearing was adjourned at the 11th hour on Wednesday because the government wanted more time to consider the new information, which Tottenham were ordered to hand over.

The hearing has been set for next month, although Tottenham and the metal company were anxious to avoid further delay.

""We were happy for the appeal to go ahead on Thursday,"" a spokesman for the metal company said.

Police are still investigating the cause of a fire at the metal company in November.

Tottenham have been trying to arrange funding for a new stadium, likely to cost about £400 million, and to find a temporary home for at least one season from as early as 2016 during building works.

The club hope that it may be possible to use Wembley, the favoured choice of supporters, despite being told by the FA that its preference was to use the national stadium for additional American football matches.

Mauricio Pochettino, the Tottenham head coach, has said that Roberto Soldado's confidence will not be affected when, as expected, he is dropped today for the Barclays Premier League match against Sunderland at White Hart Lane.

The forward hit the bar from a few yards in the 4-2 victory over Burnley in the FA Cup third-round replay at White Hart Lane on Wednesday.

I remember the 1990 season when we beat Aston Villa to the title and thrashing Coventry 6-1 on the last day. Hard to believe it's been 25 years since then. I remember being in school and making fun of the Man Utd fans that hadn't won a title in 25 years (before '92 their previous title was 1967!).

When stuff like this comes up, it really highlights the dichotomy between history and the modern advances in technology, entertainment, and so forth.

The fact is, the planet is only so big and the population is expanding. As populations expand, so too do civilizations. This means that one of two things has to happen:

1. We can expand society into new areas that have not yet been urbanized/civilized, or

2. We have to build over the old and update it to the new

Granted, a football stadium is more toward the ""less important"" end of the spectrum, but still. The world, and the UK especially, is only so big. If you want to more forward as a society, you have to build over your history or lessen what precious little of nature is left.

Personally, I'd hate to see history damaged, too. But this is the stark reality.

BTW: I'm not gonna advocate for damaging history in the name of a new stadium. I'm just saying, in the grand scheme of things....well, it's gonna happen eventually.

&gt;Blunt had piano and violin lessons as a child, but his first significant exposure to popular music was at Harrow School. There, he was introduced to the guitar by a fellow student, and started playing the instrument and writing songs at age 14.[9][26] At University of Bristol, his undergraduate thesis was The Commodification of Image – Production of a Pop Idol; one of his main references for the thesis was Simon Frith, a sociologist and rock critic, and chair of the Mercury Music Prize panel of judges since 1992.[27][28] While still in the army Blunt would work on demos during his time off. **A backing vocalist and songwriting collaborator suggested he contact Elton John's manager Todd Interland, with whom she used to share a house.**[29] Interland told HitQuarters that he listened to Blunt's demo while driving home and after hearing the track 'Goodbye My Lover', pulled over and called the mobile number written on the CD to set up a meeting.[29]

But I mean, most successful people are helped by some form of nepotism.  I agree that the problems are more structural and it's kind of unfair of the labour guy to single people out, Calvin Harris did it better ages ago with his '[rich peoples kids](http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/14/calvin-harris-twitter-meltdown)' rant aswell. There is much less chance of less privileged people to enter arts industries with and most importantly (imo) not much in the way of pre training or opportunities to develop skills that a theatre/music club or even 'scene' provides and also that early entry into that type of career requires you to support yourself on little or no pay for an extended period of time and/or pay for expensive schools with a relatively slim chance of success. Also I think generally it seems to go with the general level of wealth inequality. 

But I think that (at least with music) the lack of music education is important, many of the artists from more modest backgrounds than blunt have come through 'the brit school' and even the x-factor type shows, maybe 'scenes' can be important aswell with bands coming from somewhat modest backgrounds like Ksabian and The Arctic Monkeys coming out of music scenes in their respective cities and the same is true of Dizzie Rascal, Wiley etc. ",null,0,null,1421682807,null,0,1421685757,0,cntvm7z,null,t3_2sxigz,null,t1_cntvm7z,null,t1_cntsmqq,null,null,null,1424792771,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

Strong, but often accurate one. 

Finding work, networking, accessing government information, free adult education, or even shopping for the best bargins/tariffs/money saving information are all difficult without access to the internet, for example. Those who can't afford a decent home connection are at a disadvantage, socially and politically. Some people, especially those way below the median income line, who might also not be the most technically minded, wouldn't be able to justify a decent home connection.

Other such activities, such as voting, political activism, involvement with local or national politics and charities are all generally seen as activities largely reserved for the middle-classes. Whereas the traditional working-class means of collective bargaining, the trade unions, are a shadow of their former selves. 

Of course, the JRF are known to make exaggerated claims, but it is still very true that there are very real educational, cultural or social barriers that would put poorer people off from being more socially active.

&gt;

&gt;The __European Free Alliance__ (__EFA__) is a [European political party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_political_party).

&gt;It consists of various [regionalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regionalism_(politics\))   political parties in Europe advocating either full political [independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence) ([statehood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state)), or some form of [devolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution) or [self-governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-governance) for their country or region.  The alliance has generally limited its membership to progressive parties,  and therefore, not all European regionalist parties are members of EFA.

&gt;Since 1999 the EFA and the [European Green Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Green_Party) (EGP) have joined forces within [The Greens–European Free Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens%E2%80%93European_Free_Alliance) (Greens/EFA) [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_groups_of_the_European_Parliament) in the [European Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament), albeit some EFA members have joined other groups from time to time.

Both Kone and Alcarez had track records with injury that Martinez assured us all would not be a problem - in Kone's case he's even said the Kone is like a younger player because he was out so long.  I sincerely question his wisdom in signing them.  He may have be familiar with them both, but there are other players he could have been using that money on - and in particular, younger players.  Let's not forget that he bought in 3 players from Wigan (and Robles was on loan there too) - a team that got relegated.  

As for Atsu - In terms of a ""step up"", how does the fact that he came to us straight from playing in the world cup do you?  For the record, as far as I see it, you don't ""get a decent chance"", you earn it, you prove yourself in training, in reserve games and in the cup.  He simply hasn't done that.

Analysis: Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent

It is all but impossible that Ms Lawrence will be able to recover the £15.95 party ""no show fee"".

Any claim would be on the basis that a contract had been created, which included a term that a ""no show"" fee would be charged.

However, for there to be a contract, there needs to be an intention to create legal relations. A child's party invitation would not create legal relations with either the child ""guest"" or its parents.

If it is being argued that the contract is with the child, it is inconceivable that a five-year-old would be seen by a court as capable of creating legal relations and entering into a contract with a ""no show"" charge.

It's amusing to imagine what a children's party invitation seeking to create a contract might say: ""I, the 'first party', hereinafter referred to as the 'birthday boy', cordially invite you the 'second party', hereinafter referred to as 'my best friend', to the party of 'the first party'.

However comics aren't just for gay people. They are for all outsiders. So also nerds. And racial minorities. Did you know that comic books are disproportionately popular, for example, amongst black people? That's why we're seeing more ethnic minorities in comic books these days (not only Nick Fury in the films. The new Captain America is also black, whilst the new Ms Marvel is a Muslim).

The bullying metaphor is quite straightforward. A small kid nicknamed ""runt"" stands up to a much larger bully who enjoys throwing his weight around. The small kid happens to be the most popular X-man ""Wolverine"" and the big fat bully is called alternately ""The Blob"", ""Sabretooth"" or ""The Juggernaut"".

The appeal to nerds can be seen in other comic books, where the nerdy guy can activate his powers and transform into a huge monster (the Hulk), or put on a costume and reveal himself as a superhero (Spider-man, Superman). Even Thor went through a stage of being a weedy looking doctor.

But yes, the gay things there. Northstar, Karma and Bling are all gay.

If you're being honest, Borini was utterly appalling against Villa. He's a disaster on the ball.

From a structural point of view, he fits in with the way we play. However, that's only half the job. If you only have 1 striker, they actually have to be half decent on the ball.

Balotelli is the opposite. He can actually do something with the ball at his feet - in fact he's one of the most skillful strikers in the world - but his style doesn't gel with those around him. He's not making the runs, pressing or tracking back as much.
We can handle him not working as hard in defence but we absolutely need him to be putting in a shift off the ball to create space and link play when we're on the attack.

I think there could be a spot for them at this level, in theory, but not in this system.
Borini needs to be doing almost all his work off the ball and Balotelli needs to be the one adding the quality on it.

The difference is to me though, that Balotelli could, theoretically, put more effort in. Borini can't will himself to be more intelligent or skillful.

Balotelli has had very little time playing in this new system.

Inform them of the circumstances and mention that you sent a letter last year. They have also responded to this letter, if they have provided a reference number then use that. In the letter tell them that they have failed to repair in their duty to maintain the road under Section 41 of the Highways Act 1980. Give a reasonable account of events and advise them that you would like damages for the glasses. If you had to visit a doctor then bring that up as well. Make it clear that you were injured and had destruction of property and odds are they will settle for the glasses to avoid an injury suit which would happen if you went for one of those awful no win no fee firms.

There is a chance they might refuse your claim under Section 58 of the highways act. Its unlikely given the injury component but possible. If they do then read this: http://www.ukroadsliaisongroup.org/en/UKRLG-and-boards/uk-roads-board/wellmaintained-highways.cfm. Then put in a Freedom of Information Request at www.whatdotheyknow.co.uk and request their policy on road maintenance. Their policy should mirror the previous one, your job is to prove that they did not abide by their policy.

These two documents will then allow you to see if their defense under S58 is reasonable. S58 basically allows them to discharge their duty by being unaware of the issue (you have proof they are aware and acknowledge danger) or were unable to repair in time between notification and accident (again unlikely due to you reporting last year).

Reply to their refusal letter outlining the facts again and stating that you do not accept their refusal under section 58. In this letter it is worth mentioning that if you do not receive recompense for the glasses you will engage legal counsel with respect of the accident and all injuries and damages suffered.

FWIW, I did not call them 'pathetic', I called to photograph of the father and son in the media pathetic as in:
Pathetic: An adjective causing or evoking pity, sympathetic sadness, sorrow, etc.; pitiful; pitiable and that is exactly the type of photo it is and exactly what they hoped to evoke. 
That poor kid. What the hell does the kid care about all this? The only reason I can see for the kids dour expression is that he's feeding of his dad's emotions and I find that terribly sad.
If his dad was reporting this from a. 'Aren't people and the world very funny sometimes and was laughing about it then I guarantee the boys face would look a lot different.

I did, though, call the action of contacting the press in the first place disgraceful as in: bringing or deserving disgrace; shameful; dishonorable; disreputable, and I think it is shameful that they thought that contacting the newspaper was the way to resolve this. 

Please tell me what possible benefit could they have imagined would be achieved by contacting the newspaper?

No. If I'm being honest I think Borini did fairly well against Villa especially in the first half. He got into some decent goal scoring postions in both halves actually. In the first half he scored and also setup Moreno for a goal that was disallowed for offside. The second half the whole team were pretty poor in honesty Villa were in control. Borini's hold up play could definitely be better, but he gets into the right places to score goals ie/ in and around the 6 yard box, something Balo rarely does. Balo will drop deep pick up the ball drive toward goal get toward the area and shoot, frustrating his team mates around him, when a clear and easy pass is on. It's frustrating to watch nevermind be on the same pitch. However all that said I do see some promise with him and Studge upfront. 

&gt; Balotelli is the opposite. He can actually do something with the ball at his feet - in fact he's one of the most skillful strikers in the world - but his style doesn't gel with those around him.

I'm yet to see any of that since he's been here really. He's done ok in tracking back and winning the ball back on the odd occasion. If he was so World Class he shouldnt have a problem with the current players around him. In fact by saying that I think you are doing a disservice to our players such as Sterling, Coutinho, Henderson, Lallana etc. They've all fed him in many times, provided assists yet he fails to score. At least with Borini he creates space and chances with his movement which our system is pretty reliant on.

It's all well and good for Murnaghan to suggest that Umunna can have thirty minutes to read it if he wants but frankly if he accepts then that's a route to pretty significantly losing face. Secondly, if I have to speak publicly, as I do relatively frequently, it takes me a while longer than 30 mins to properly consider and formulate my ideas and the words with which I want to present them. It's not even a question of 'not wanting to be honest,' it's a question of not wanting to look like a complete twat, and not inadvertently saying something slightly different than you mean. This is especially true of something which must necessarily be placed in a complex social context to which I am not in my daily life privy. 

Not wanting to talk off the cuff about something you haven't read is entirely sensible - and to say so outright is a credit to his integrity.

Not wanting to do so about a situation like this, when he may not be familiar with the broader context, is even more understandable. Especially when he has a position of influence such that he does, and the potential that brings for impacting on people's lives. 

The video however *does* seem to imply that he has a solid understanding of the context, but not of the specific document. In that case it's especially cheeky and unprofessional of Murnaghan  to suggest that the 'letter is the thing'. 

To be honest this boils down to what it usually boils down to. Sky News is and continues to be a cesspit of tabloid-grade journalism.

Comparing their records in Italy is tough because Serie A when Mourinho was at Inter was at the end of it's time at the top whereas Rafa has been managing in a poorer league with a ridiculously dominant Juve. Mourinho won two league titles, the Italian cup and the champions league and in his first season with Napoli Rafa won the Italian cup.


I have not counted Mourinho's time at Porto. The champions league in 04 was very weird. Porto came 2nd in there group and their run in was United, Lyon, Deportivo, Monaco... not taking anything away from the achievement but well it was a strange year.

Also it is worth taking into account the fact that Mourinho has managed clubs who were some of the most valuable in Europe and in their respective leagues at the time.

&gt;For many years the government claimed that immigration added £6 billion a year to GDP. *However, the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, reporting in April 2008, said that what mattered was GDP per head. They concluded that:*

&gt;“We have found no evidence for the argument, made by the government, business and many others, that net immigration generates significant economic benefits for the existing UK population”.
In January 2012 the Migration Advisory Committee went further. They said that even GDP per head exaggerated the benefit of immigration because:

I could do what he did, if I didn't care about accumulating fouls and cards. 

He got this hard-man reputation through that when he was just aggressively fouling much small/lighter people. Mascherano or Matic are skilled DM's; he was just a bullish knob. Because he's grown a tramp beard and fouled players during his time, apparently he's this hard-man warrior who should never be trifled with. He won a lot with them so people regularly forget how much of an absolute wanker he was. Viera did everything he did but with class and actual skill, and didn't rely on mind games and violence.

I think our biggest problem though was Pellegrini didn't adapt. Wenger clearly outsmarted him, but Pellegrini waited too long to change. The second half was just them hanging on for dear life at times, but that should have been the case from about 30 minutes in. Jovetic could and perhaps should have scored a brace, we found space because Coquelin took out Silva and Jovetic coming on basically doubled up Coquelin which was great for a while until dinho went off, which left Cazorla free to go after one of them.

&gt;There is a clear and urgent need to improve the data and information
about gross and net migration flows to and from the UK, and about
the size, geographical distribution and characteristics of the
immigrant stock. The inadequacies of the current data create a number of
problems. They reduce the efficiency of the allocation of government
resources to local councils that provide public services across the UK. The
Statistics Commission pointed out that “some £100 billion a year is being
distributed through formulae that are directly affected by migration
estimates”

And:

&gt;Although possible in theory, we found no systematic empirical
evidence to suggest that net immigration creates significant dynamic
benefits for the resident population in the UK. This does not
necessarily mean that such effects do not exist but that there is
currently no systematic evidence for them and it is possible that there
are also negative dynamic and wider welfare effects. 

And lastly:

interest of individual employers is not always in the best interest of
the economy as a whole. ",null,0,null,1421688726,null,0,false,0,cntywxf,null,t3_2sxafw,null,t1_cntywxf,null,t1_cntypcl,null,null,null,1424791172,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

null,false,lordsmitty,null,null,null,"I don't see how you can claim that his actions could not under any circumstances be considered a mistake. One may consider it to be a mistake as he obviously did not know what he was really getting himself into. In the same way that a driver may not realise that the street he is driving down is a one way street this individual may not have know the true severity of the situation that he was getting himself into. Is it not conceivable that a second generation Muslim living in Briton may not actually know much at all about what it would be like to live as a Muslim in Syria? And that the ideas that grew in his mind about what it would be like to go to Syria and fight in a religious war may not actually be anything like the reality of the situation? 

I would imagine that many who wish to go out to Syria and fight alongside ISIS probably have a very distorted and romanticised view about what they would be doing. They may see themselves as being a part of some revolution and creating a better life for other members of their religion and fighting against the 'oppressive regimes' of the west. If I were trying to recruit people living in an entirely different country to come and fight alongside me in a war-torn country I'd make it sound as attractive as possible wouldn't you? 

As others have said, to treat this individual with a little respect doesn't mean that we think what he did was somehow okay, if he is going to suffer from his experiences for the rest of his life (I don't know how severe it really is) then wouldn't that be punishment enough for what he did anyway? If we just leave him to suffer we hardly give much credence to the idea that as a modern civilised society we believe in treating all humans with some basic level of respect and believe that people should be given an opportunity to show that they can change. He may also have valuable information about fighting alongside ISIS and could help to show other that they may also be making a mistake by going out there and joining the fight.   

Even if you despise this individual for what he did you can hardly argue that not doing anything about him and other like him is a better alternative than an attempt at rehabilitation and further integration into our society.

&gt;We examine the impact on the UK economy of the flow of workers from ten East European countries
after their accession to the European Union. We find evidence that those most susceptible to
competition from these workers have seen weaker wage inflation.

&gt; We document that the presence of
these foreign workers has increased the fear of unemployment and helped to contain wage pressure.
We argue that this inflow of workers has increased supply by more than it has raised demand and,
thus, had the effect of reducing both inflationary pressures and the natural rate of unemployment.

""Contain wage pressure"" = keep wages low.

It may reduce unemployment, but it does so at the cost of wages.

[Their own figure](http://i.imgur.com/73mWjpo.png) shows the stagnation of wages which they admit is caused by immigration either directly due to labour competition or indirectly through an increased fear of unemployment.

He is also often far too timid to attack space when he does have it in these matches, and I've no idea why. We need more players like Townsend willing to run directly at the opposition's throats and take them on to cause disorganization, just as he did against Sunderland.

I agree forward is more important in general, but not given our specific squad needs. Yes we absolutely need better goalscoring options after Kane as our others aren't getting it done, but a more aggressive winger and/or central midfielder would be more conducive to opening up these smaller sides and securing those points.
