How you get drunk very much changes how you act while drunk. Aiming to get drunk is very different from drinking because you enjoy the drink. 

Drinking with a meal puts you in a very different mindset. 

I don't see an issue with ""casual"" drinking. I.e. Drinking because you enjoy the drink. You drink it like you would any other drink. But if you drink it over a long period of time you slowly become tipsy then drunk. It's a slower transition which very much changes your attitude. 

Drinking to get drunk involves drinking games, downing drinks, buying spirits (with or without mixers). Buying cheap alcohol because it's cheap (rather than enjoying it as drink). 

Your mentality going into a drunk state is so important in affecting what you're like when drunk. And that's the biggest difference between the UK and the rest of Europe. 

----

All that being said, I've never had an issue with feeling pressured to get drunk. I found a group of friends who would rarely play drinking games, but enjoyed chilling at home chatting with a few chilled beers. 

I actually think it's the concept of people drinking to get drunk that puts people off ever drinking alcohol. They see it as something bad, rather than a taste to enjoy in moderation. But I'm not going to change the way I interact with you if you choose that. It just feels illogical to me that you'd rule something out of your life because of potential consequences that can easily be avoided by not being an idiot.

In fact, I hate people who think that they aren't accountable for things they did while drunk.

I think it's about my mentality going into it though. I pretty much never drink to get drunk. Most of the time I drink it's going to be a single glass of wine with a meal. I like the flavour more than anything. It's just nice to have a flavoured drink that isn't 80% sugar or fruit juice. And alcohol is one of those that goes well with food. 

(Other amazing drinks include tea, coffee and chocolate milk). 

I guess when it comes down to it I find it illogical to avoid something which is safe (short term, not talking alcoholics here) and can be done in an environment in which you feel comfortable. Especially as it's something you can safely rack up. 

Take weed. I have never done weed, but not because I'm afraid of it. I've just never had an opportunity to do it in an environment in which I'm comfortable to try it (probably due to its legality). If it's legalised then one of the first things my family would do is try it out together.

That right there's the problem.

Not that you can have fun without drinking, but that automatic self-aggrandising, judgemental assumption that other people can't merely because they tend to have *even more* fun when they choose to drink.

Imagine that you're trying to relax with a bunch of people (could be friends, work colleagues or people you barely know), and are planning to have a precise variety of fun that necessarily impairs your judgement, makes you more vulnerable and lowers your inhibitions... and one of the reasons you aren't worried about getting into that state with your friends or strangers around you is because they'll all be in the same position, and none of *them* are going to be sat on one side, judging the shit out of you all night and carefully dissecting every moment of stupidity remind you all about it the following morning.

It's entirely possible to not drink and still be the kind of fun, awesome friend that joins in, *doesn't* judge the shit out of people who do, allows everyone to feel comfortable and doesn't make people feel uncomfortable by reminding them what idiots they were last night when they were all relaxed, sociable and their guard was down.

However, absolutely none of that starts with the bitter, critical attitude that people who drink *need* to do it merely in order to enjoy themselves, or that you're some sort of magical special snowflake just because you don't need to either.

I don't mean to be a dick, but I don't think you realise quite how twatty and obnoxious that attitude really is to people who do choose to drink socially.

If he were to become the next Ronaldo, I feel it would be a lot easier for him to do when he's guaranteed to be one of the first names on the team sheet than a very good prospect who won't necessarily start every game at City. I'd be a lot happier to let him go to Barca/Real on better terms in a couple of years rather than see him force a move to City at the moment.

Admittedly most of my opinion on this is coloured by a string of horrific experiences with drunk people and an alcoholic ex who would verbally abuse me until I cried whenever he was drunk (so all the fucking time), but still.

My next-door-neighbour invited me to a party one time. This consisted of watching her and her mates get shitfaced at her house (admittedly this was fun until too much drink was had), then moving on to the local pub where they tried to force me to dance and it was just generally awful and awkward.

They were all horifically sick both that night and the next morning. One didn't remember hooking up with her deadbeat on-again-off-again boyfriend. One had a screaming match in the street with her boyfriend at 3AM. One had her estranged ""husband"" banging on the door in a drunken stupor in the wee hours of the morning screaming for her to take him back until we called the police to get rid of him.

Being the only sober person in a crowd of drunks is horrific. But apparently nobody in the UK can do anything without getting off their face first.

!!!! 

There's a big saving to be had there. Are you regularly phoning abroad or premium rate numbers? A decent ""SIM only""  contract will be less than £20 for a huge amount of data, text, and voice. You can pick up a decent 2nd hand Android phone for £50 in CEX - or brand new ones for £150.

It might be worth investing in a cheap Laptop / Chromebook. Depending on where you're living you might want to pay for Internet access or make sure your phone contract allows tethering. 

Again, depending on where you live and how much stuff you have, it could be worth getting contents insurance. How much would it cost you to replace *everything*? 

Some people find it easier / safer to only spend using a credit/debit card. You can track all your purchases online and, if you lose your wallet, you won't have lost all the cash in it. I understand that you may be reticent to that idea, if so, withdraw small amounts of money from the ATM as and when you need it.

If you want the status quo you will vote for the party in power, not the opposition... It's just common sense, there's no point electing a new party just to continue the current governments work. The opposition needs to offer actual change to be electable, otherwise why bother to vote for them?

You only have to look at the Tories in 2000 and 2005 to see how utterly ridiculous it becomes when the opposition essentially copy the ruling party and try to campaign on just being a spineless copycat.

Labour cannot rely on maintaining the working class support forever. We've seen their base disintegrate in Scotland. Their base will disintegrate within a couple of decades in Wales for the same reasons. They neglect their constituents and spend too much time chasing Middle England voters who then vote Tory anyway.

Labour is becoming far too complacent. There is a real demand for a populist workers party that obviously would not have the seats to win an election, but it would end Labours chance of ever winning a majority again. As it stands now Labour will likely lose the support of its base, and the floating voters will simply favour the current party in power, as both parties will be utterly indistinguishable from each other in terms of policy.

A writer said the French commander: 'Came forth into the seas and arrived on the coast of Sussex before Brighthamstead (Brighton) and set certain of his soldiers on land to burn and spoil the country, but the beacons were lit (to warn people in the nearby villages and call on them to help) and the inhabitants thereabout came down so thick, that the Frenchmen were driven to fly with loss of diverse of their numbers so that they did little hurt there'.",null,0,null,1434272241,null,0,1434272730,0,cs614a6,null,t3_39qju9,null,t1_cs614a6,null,t3_39qju9,null,null,null,1436986380,null,8,false,brighton,t5_2qprp,8,null

null,false,spiz,null,null,null,"&gt; They neglect their constituents and spend too much time chasing Middle England voters who then vote Tory anyway.

This is really Labour's problem.  They can't seem to go after one without pissing off the other.  With Blair they could attract both, but then he went and did the Iraq thing, which made his brand of politics more toxic than Thatcher.

The rise of the SNP is huge a problem - mainly for the reasons you say, but also because the SNP's main rival is Labour, not the Conservatives.  The SNP care more about Holyrood and the Tories will never win there.  Now, Labour are fighting a war on two fronts in Westminster - vs. the Tories for England and vs. the SNP for Scotland.  It's unclear if they can come up with a common set of policies that will fend off both parties.  Even if they were to give up Scotland to fight the Tories for England (a bad idea in itself that **no one** has advocated), they'd still have the SNP kicking them for 5 years.

&gt; As it stands now Labour will likely lose the support of its base, and the floating voters will simply favour the current party in power, as both parties will be utterly indistinguishable from each other in terms of policy.

I don't think they'll become indistinguishable in terms of policy (I thought they certainly weren't in this election),  Labour will attack the centre from the centre-left and the Tories will attack it from the centre-right.  

The problem seems to be that left-wing voters think centrist policies are too right wing.  That leaves them upset with Labour.  If Labour have the SNP attacking from the left and UKIP/Tories attacking from the right, it's going to be difficult to keep everyone happy.

I certainly agree with you that they risk losing the support of their base - particularly if more ""SNP clones"" start appearing.

I am not saying D&amp;D is the best system, but the new incarnation is one of my favourites. The sort of rules lite and fun attitude to the game is pretty great at making for dynamic story telling, and the statistics used work for me personally, as no enemy is ever irrelevant.

They did have a very different design philosophy, as the whole game was built around playing in Dungeons that experienced, professional DM's had built. 3e and 3.5 moved away from that sort of game and became a much more free flowing experience, now the game is encouraged to take place outside of dungeons, and all the tools to build a campaign where made readily available. 5e has taken this further by improving how these systems work, and making a fantastic DM's guide teaching all the ins and outs of your own campaign.

Um, that's just a euphemism for punishment.

Which is exactly what people say about EVERY shaming.  'Oh well, if he/she didn't want their lives ruined then they shouldn't have said those things.  They should have known the reaction it would get.'

&gt;does the fact that he's a Nobel Prize winner give him a free pass to say what he likes?

You know what?  I think so, yes.  Nobel prize winners ought to be able to express any dumb opinion they want.  There's a long and proud history of Nobelists who lived out their post Nobel career making scandalous (and often hilarious) remarks and I'd like to see that tradition continue.

&gt;What if he said the Black people had no place in the lab? would you react the same?

First off - I don't think that Hunts' comments were tantamount to serious bigotry.  They were idle sexist remarks, and not a serious suggestion that we should really exclude women from the lab.  

OK, so what if a Nobelist made disparaging remarks about black people?  Well, exactly that happened with James Watson (co-discover of DNA) a couple of years ago, who said something to the effect that we all secretly know that black people are less intelligent.  And Watson's career was also destroyed.  

My opinion on the Watson affair?  I think that people had a right to be offended and that people were right to counter his remarks, but I also think that - even in that case - it was wrong to end his career.  Unless Watson could be shown to be actually discriminating against black people, then he should have had a right to his opinion and that it was wrong to fire him.

My point is solely that no media organisation the world over gives its content out for free. Somewhere someone is paying for it, and it is worthwhile considering who that is. If it is you, the consumer, that the organisation relies upon, or is it an advertiser who might push for popular programmes to get their message out to more people, or is it the government who might encourage or force the organisation to lean a certain way?

I'm not saying which way is better, just throwing that out there. 

Also, it is entirely possible to view content without paying the licence fee quite legally nowadays. You can stream content which isn't live from ITV, Channel 4, Five and yes, BBC.

null,false,unixbeard,newcr-1,,null,"Slovenia v England: Ross Barkley still learning says Wayne Rooney as Roy Hodgson resists starting him

Hodgson hails 'game-changer' Barkley, but Everton midfielder will likely be on the bench in Ljubljana

In the space of two minutes during England training at Stozice stadium on Saturday night, Ross Barkley nutmegged Jamie Vardy, played a pin-point pass to Phil Jagielka while lying on the floor and bamboozled Phil Jones with his touch as Ray Lewington bellowed his approval.
England love Barkley in training but do not yet trust the precocious Everton talent in games. Pity.

England have frequently been suspicious of those with gifts, preferring those who graft, a point that will not have been lost on Glenn Hoddle as he arrived in this wonderful Slovenian city on broadcasting duties. Hoddle represented England on 53 occasions but he was never fully appreciated.

Making comparisons between individuals and generations is a pursuit riddled with hazards but there are fears Barkley may head down the Hoddle route, admired for his abilities but not built around.

Like Hoddle, Barkley is tall but with a silky touch and an adventurous approach. The 21‑year-old player ran that Stozice session, holding off opponents with his strength, distributing the ball accurately with either foot. But it was training.
Barkley is passionate to do well with England and simply craves the chance in that central midfield three. Jack Wilshere, Jordan Henderson and Fabian Delph start ahead of him against Slovenia. Barkley’s impact will come, if at all, from the bench.

Roy Hodgson, the England manager, insisted he was not interested in “putting on a show”, simply collecting the points to take England closer to Euro 2016.
However, even Hodgson accepts that Barkley is a “fine player, a game-changer” and England have too few of those.

As so often, some sensible counsel was provided by Wayne Rooney. A man who knows plenty about being an Everton and England prodigy, Rooney made some significant observations about Barkley before stepping on to the pitch for training.
“Ross is a fantastic talent,” Rooney, the England captain, said. “He’s a big strong lad, quick and uses both feet.

“He’s obviously got a lot of learning to do in his game but he’s got such a bright future. Ability-wise it’s incredible really. Some of the things you see him do in training is fantastic. It’s on him now to go and do that in the games.
“What I’ve seen of him playing for Everton, training with England and the times he has come on for England, he is a fantastic player with a really bright future.”

“Learning to do”. The phrase leapt from Rooney’s otherwise eulogistic appraisal of Barkley. He does gamble with possession in dangerous areas, turning into traffic in his own half rather than keeping it simple, keeping the ball. “We all have things to learn,’’ Rooney said.
“Expressing himself around the box is not a problem. It is just in his own half really. Ross knows that. I’ve spoken to Ross over that. He’s a young lad, he’s going to learn that. He’s got a really bright future.”

First capped in September 2013 against Moldova, Barkley has appeared 13 times for England but started only twice, in the Ecuador friendly in Miami when he sparkled but was criticised by Hodgson for risking possession, and in the World Cup dead rubber against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte.

Hodgson was again forced to defend his sparing use of Barkley this week, the England manager arguing that “with the best will in the world you couldn’t say the reason I have chosen him is because he has been fantastic in the latter games of the season for Everton”.
At some point, Hodgson and Roberto Martinez, the Everton manager, must consider building around Barkley. The boy can play.

If England had a true holding midfielder then the other central midfielders would be able to express themselves.
If England are to demonstrate the touch, vision and boldness to live with the best, Barkley will be central to such ambition but he does need to acquire more game-craft.",null,0,null,1434277063,null,0,false,0,cs623kc,null,t3_39r2p5,null,t1_cs623kc,null,t1_cs5z20m,null,null,null,1436987207,null,5,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,5,null

Not an unfair question, but all the same, part of me objects to this line of approach.  Being called a racist or being seen to endorse racism is one of the biggest taboos in society.  Thus, any time people discuss bigotry, it seems a sure bet that someone will try to compare it to racism - in the hope that the STIGMA OF SHAME will wash off and the other person will be forced to back down.

[Article from businessinsider](http://uk.businessinsider.com/snowden-russia-china-and-nsa-files-2015-6?r=US). Relevant parts:

-

&gt;The 31-year-old told James Risen of The New York Times in October 2013 that there was “a zero percent chance the Russians or Chinese have received any documents.”

-

&gt;Risen also reported, citing an encrypted chat with Snowden, that the former CIA technician ""gave all of the classified documents he had obtained to journalists he met in Hong Kong.""

-

&gt;Two days after checking out of the Mira Hotel on June 10, Snowden showed The South China Morning Post (SCMP) an unknown number of documents revealing ""operational details of specific [NSA] attacks on [Chinese] computers, including internet protocol (IP) addresses, dates of attacks, and whether a computer was still being monitored remotely."" 


-

&gt;The cache given to Poitras and Greenwald allegedly included 58,000 ""highly classified UK intelligence documents,"" The Telegraph reported in August after the UK government detained David Miranda, Glenn Greenwald's partner, as he traveled through London's Heathrow Airport.

-

&gt;Authorities say they confiscated electronic devices in which classified documents were stored as well as a password.

-

&gt;“Much of the material is encrypted. **However, among the unencrypted documents ... was a piece of paper that included the password for decrypting one of the encrypted files on the external hard drive recovered from the claimant,""** the UK government stated to the court.

-

&gt;senior UK officals allege that Moscow gained access to more than 1 million classified files, and the journalists are believed to have received about 200,000. And it's still unclear what happened to the documents not given to journalists.

By the above Snowden is a traitor for releasing to the Chinese press (which is all controlled by the government) documents that show the offensive/defensive capabilities of his government.

[Article from businessinsider](http://uk.businessinsider.com/snowden-russia-china-and-nsa-files-2015-6?r=US). Relevant parts:

-

&gt;The 31-year-old told James Risen of The New York Times in October 2013 that there was “a zero percent chance the Russians or Chinese have received any documents.”

-

&gt;Risen also reported, citing an encrypted chat with Snowden, that the former CIA technician ""gave all of the classified documents he had obtained to journalists he met in Hong Kong.""

-

&gt;Two days after checking out of the Mira Hotel on June 10, Snowden showed The South China Morning Post (SCMP) an unknown number of documents revealing ""operational details of specific [NSA] attacks on [Chinese] computers, including internet protocol (IP) addresses, dates of attacks, and whether a computer was still being monitored remotely.""

-

&gt;The cache given to Poitras and Greenwald allegedly included 58,000 ""highly classified UK intelligence documents,"" The Telegraph reported in August after the UK government detained David Miranda, Glenn Greenwald's partner, as he traveled through London's Heathrow Airport.

-

&gt;Authorities say they confiscated electronic devices in which classified documents were stored as well as a password.

-

&gt;“Much of the material is encrypted. **However, among the unencrypted documents ... was a piece of paper that included the password for decrypting one of the encrypted files on the external hard drive recovered from the claimant,""** the UK government stated to the court.

-

&gt;senior UK officals allege that Moscow gained access to more than 1 million classified files, and the journalists are believed to have received about 200,000. And it's still unclear what happened to the documents not given to journalists.

This seems like a big reaction to one post by a complaining [user who has never submitted one thing to this subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/user/mansefson/submitted/)

Some of you will know that I think that the rules are too restrictive. I find that submissions I make, which tend to be a bit left-field, or funny, are at risk of removal

I just had another removal today. [See here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/39r5ud/led_waterslide_is_reminiscent_of_the_opening/cs5skme?context=3) The thing is, that material is well-intended, and it is the sort of thing I like to see as a DW fan. I found it in an FB group where it was popular among the DW fans there. If users here don't like something, they can just vote it down, and I am fine with that. I am just irritated when the users don't get that choice, because a mod decides to enforce the more damaging rules that day. I wonder what I am missing, submitted by others.

So, my suggestion for improving this subreddit is to relax the on-topic and off-topic definitions. In particular, I'd rescind [Disallowed content rule 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/wiki/policies/content) in its entirety, and allow the users to decide what they want.

I'd love to hear what others think about this. I'd be interested to see what happened if the rule were rescinded for a fixed trial period.

null,false,Bbrhuft,null,null,null,"Victim A: Police wrote to every household in the home town of the victim appealing for corroborating witnesses of Harris twice touching her inappropriately in front of her mother when she was about 9 years old after cueing to get his autograph. Police trawled council records and newspapers to find any support that the packed autograph singing event in her small Devon home town took place, it was, the victim claimed, attended by hundreds of towns folk. No one came forward and no written evidence was found the event took place. The council was clear that if their town hall was used, they would have a record of it. Before naming Harris, victim A was a member of a child abuse support group and she only named Harris after he was named in the media. 

Victim B said that Harris firmly touched her bottom at a charity sports event, on TV she changed her story to, he touched my breast. She couldn't remember where in Cambridge it happened, she mixed up the parks. She said was very surprised he was convicted of the assault on her and she was happy to help the other victims. 

Victim D was thousands of dollars in depth when she sold her story of Harris assaulting her in packed pub via her publicity agent and boyfriend. The event was attended by her chaperone and dance group, the first assault happened as she sat on his lap and he again sexually assaulted her after she ran to the pub toilets. She claimed the assault gave her an eating disorder and she could not get any acting parts. However, was shown she landed an acting part in a TV soap a month after returning to Australia. Her chaperone clearly remembered the night, that everyone had a good time, she didn't notice victim D getting upset. She became friends with Harris who she said was very generous and helpful. She at first didn't believe victim D until she met and talked to her in person.

Victim C, friend of the family. I leave this case til last, as it's her case that he appears clearly guilty of. The card he sent to her was daming, her story is credible. But there's some room for doubt.

Harris was in a consensual relationship with her for about 10 years until she was 29 years old. Then in the early 90s Harris claimed she phoned him and demanded £5000 for her boyfriend's bird sanctuary, Harris claimed it was blackmail. She has a different story, she asked him for £25,000 but it wasn't blackmail. I didn't think this undermined her story, but I later learnt that she broke up with Harris and started accusing him of child abuse in the same year she didn't get the money for her boyfriend's bird sanctuary. 

Edit: Victim C asked Harris for £30,000 in 1994. Harris thought is was £25,000. That's the year the affair ended, she was 29. So the abuse occurred between 1978-1984.

Also, Victim D sold her story for £33,000.

Edit 2: Harris sent victim C a vulgar card, it was one of the most daming pieces of evidence against him. Just found out, it was sent in 1994, when their relationship ended. The same year she asked him for £30,000 and began to accuse him of child abuse.

The press can't call her a dangerous kidnapper if the police are saying something completely different, it's confusing for the readers.

Based on the case history, it wouldn't be unwise for the police to assume that she has underlying mental health issues. The court has repeatedly ruled that she is a danger to the wellbeing of the child, and thus ordered supervised access only. So, it's not exactly a tenuous association to worry she is a physical danger to the child.

Fathers, it [depends](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-31737694) just as much as with the mother. In this much lower profile case, the father is believed to have absconded because the mother (his ex-partner) wanted to stop access. The police set the tone with the missing comments, and it has predominately continued.

However, if we get Falcao for free with a cheap buy-clause I'll give him the benefit of a doubt because he had his best time as lone striker at Porto and Atletico. A system similar to ours and far away from what United played last season.

 I think he can be a very good addition but I don't think he'll come as third striker nor do I think Remy will stay another year as third option.

To be honest, I'm not *reaaaaaally* that big a fan of Nick Frost. Or indeed, a fan of Nick Frost at all. Or Simon Pegg. Or any of their films. 


But, I did like the episode, and the series as a whole. Probably the best series so far, since 2005 at least. Each episode seemed really strong, and each episode seemed memorable, which is more than can be said fir some of the previous series.


The main point is of course Capaldi as the Doctor. Perfect, as I knew he would be. He was still finding his feet, settling his character as it were, during there series but I think he's nailed it down now. And his costume, I love it. But I am glad he has (And very small spoilers for series 9 folks) git a new coat to add a bit more colour to it. And it was the colour I had thought of when I spent a couple of hours messing about his image in photoshop. 


And Clara! Clara, Clara, Clara, only you, the Impossible Girl, could go from being a companion I wasn't particularly attached to to being one if my favourites. She developed, she became more complex and she was an interesting and flawed character. And that's why I now love her. 


Danny, and perhaps I'm in a minority, but I quite liked him. He collided with the Doctor because of their conflicting ideologies and it was great to watch. I found the seething hatred that was spat his way by some fans was completely underserved. 


Missy was a bit of a let down for me. I know, I know, I said it but let me explain. I like the way Gomez portrayed the Master; I do, it was quite interesting to watch. But I was hoping she was going to be someone, or something, other than the Master because it was, well, a bit predictable. Wasn't it so obvious? It was very early on the series when I clocked that that was the Master and I kept hoping for it to turn out to be someone else: the Rani, the Monk, the Valeyard, or, Rassilon forbid, someone new. That was the biggest gripe I had with the series as a whole. 


The tone and themes if the show I found to be very compelling. We had 3 or 4 years of a whimsical Doctor, a fairy tale really, which I hadn't really enjoyed that much, though I am beginning to appreciate parts of it now that era has ended. But now everything was, generally, much darker, much more real, in a sense. And the themes of the importance of being a good man, what it means to be one, it's limits; the importance of friendship and how strong they can be; what change can bring and it's problems; and the importance of heroes. 


Overall, I did really enjoy this series of Doctor Who.",null,0,null,1434283196,null,0,false,0,cs63dtf,null,t3_39sogq,null,t1_cs63dtf,null,t3_39sogq,null,null,null,1436988298,null,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4,null

Also, the digging down: does anyone even think about it before saying it? I'm not saying it's impossible, but there are historical problems related to that, but more to the point digging down doesn't solve the problem of needing more external space. Think about it. 

The stands are already very close to the pitch so digging down doesn't solve an immediate problem. 

The whole stadium will need to moved within the boundaries of Stamford Bridge and it will probably mean you'll have stands that are deeper at one end than they are the other. So the stadium could be much wider and deeper toward the South end by turning that end slightly West and removing the complexes to make it deeper.

If you're arguing from the dubious standpoint of 'sociology', I suppose they have redefined what racism is in that particular field which nobody can argue against because of sociologists want to redfine something in their field, nobody can stop them, just like if I as a chemist started a movement to change the meaning of a Lewis base into molecules that are strictly trigonal planar with an empty P orbital rather than the wider meaning of molecules that can accept a lone pair of electrons, as long as I got enough chemists to agree, I could.

In a wider context, in everyday speech, racism is discrimination based on race or belief in superiority or inferiority based on race. In this way, everyone can be racist. Institutional racism is something that whites in the west cannot experience, which is what I think you're referring to. That much is true - but a person cannot be institutionally racist. I can't be institutionally racist, but I can be racist on a personal level, just as much as the next person.

Bahar Mustafa clearly has a toxic, antagonistic personality and to be honest, the exact nature of her prejudice is neither here nor there; if you don't want to use the word racist that's fine but it doesn't excuse her unneeded provocation (from a position where she should be fostering good relations between everyone) of an entire (fairly large) demographic. It is unneeded and unbecoming of someone in her position.

OK I've done it for you - first result:

""At any rate, with 114 million subscribers worldwide""

We have 60 million people in the UK, thereabouts. With only 25 million licence fee payers:

""2013/14       25,419,296 "" (source:http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/foi-licences-facts-and-figures-AB18)

It utterly cannot even remotely compete in it's current format. Take away the licence fee and you'll get even less ""subscribers"", and you really think we could match for even one program, something that HBO makes? 

No. Not at all. So we'd be left with an organisation competing for ratings in exactly the same way ITV, C4, and the like do. You'll get plenty of ""The Boy Who Ate His Brain"" and not much Panorama. You'll be lucky if there's such stuff as Newsnight, or Radio 4's The Life Scientific, or Woman's Hour, or Question Time, or Planet Earth, Shark, or any number of high quality, cutting edge shows. Forget Radio really, it just couldn't be funded. It'd be extinct. How do you think blind people feel about losing Radio 4? 

You won't see ""Rome"" or ""Sherlock"" or ""Spooks"" or even ""Doctor Who"". You'll see acquisitions from the US, putting the BBC in a direct bidding war for shows like The Walking Dead, GoT, Breaking Bad and the like. And they'd be competing with Sky, Virgin, BT, and the like...and they already have an established subscriber base.

HBO's reach is worldwide, is utterly epic in terms of it's funding - and we'd have less than an eighth of it's reach, a fraction of it's budget and they would be competing with providers already on the market for exactly the same shows with no revenue to produce their own content. And what do they produce though? Huge budget dramas and TV shows...do they really take huge risks like the Beeb do though? No. They make money, first and foremost. That's not what the Beeb are focused on.",null,0,null,1434287544,null,0,1434287802,0,cs64k5g,null,t3_39rutb,null,t1_cs64k5g,null,t1_cs649q0,null,null,null,1436989188,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null
null,false,VettelS,null,null,null,"I don't particularly care how the BBC is funded - just that it continues to be funded to at least its current level. Whether that means carrying on with the existing model, funding through general taxation, or introducing a subscription model, I'm not concerned. Given the choice, I would probably prefer to see the BBC funded through general taxation, so as to spread the cost over the entire population.

The BBC's impartiality, when it comes to news and current affairs, is vital. BBC News is not beholden to the same vested interests as Sky News, CNN, Fox, NBC, etc. The BBC is just about the only place, along with Reuters, that you can get unbiased, English speaking, World news. I think that's worth protecting.

And because the BBC doesn't have to chase viewing figures like the commercial channels do, it broadcasts a lot of programs that, almost certainly, would never be made if it were left up to ITV, Channel 4 or Sky. The BBC has an excellent range of current affairs programs: Daily Politics, Sunday Politics, Newsnight, Panorama, This Week and Question Time. If weren't for the BBC, how many of those would ever have seen the light of day on any of the commercial channels? The only comparable program is Channel 4's Dispatches, but none of those other channels have anything similar. Of course, you can't say for sure that ITV wouldn't, if the BBC didn't exist, be broadcasting their own version of Daily Politics, but I doubt it somehow - the viewing figures would almost certainly be too low to justify it.

And then there's documentaries. The BBC's documentaries are excellent and cover a wide range of topics. Horizon springs immediately to mind, but there's a seemingly endless list of shorter-lived or one-off programmes. Of course, ITV and Channel 4 have their own selection of factual programming, but they're nowhere near as diverse and in-depth as the BBC's. The BBC especially excels are topics like science, geography and history; I don't know about you, but whenever we were showed a documentary at school, it was invariably one of the BBC's.

Finally, there's the BBC's drama series. Channel 4 is good at comedy-drama series aimed at a younger audience (think Skins, The Inbetweeners, Fresh Meat, etc.), but the BBC is good at the more serious, adult-oriented dramas: The Office, Like of Mars, Ashes to Ashes, Luther, Sherlock, Garrow's Law, The Thick of It, The Game. All of these are high-quality, British dramas; again, we don't know for sure tat wouldn't exist without the BBC, but it's unlikely. By UK standards, a lot of these are pretty high-budget productions that the commercial channels would be reluctant to take a gamble on. ITV has had excellent success with Downton Abbey - and that's certainly high-budget - but it's a one off. For every Downton Abbey episode, there's 1000 TOWIEs or IACGMOOHs, or whatever other detritus ITV pumps out. US dramas, whilst excellent and numerous, cater primarily for the US audience. This means that they're primarily made up of a US cast and many of them have significantly larger budgets than even the BBC could manage.",null,0,null,1434287554,null,0,false,0,cs64k9h,null,t3_39rutb,null,t1_cs64k9h,null,t3_39rutb,null,null,null,1436989189,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

null,false,whydoyouonlylie,null,null,null,"William Binney, Russ Tice, Thomas Tamm, Daniel Ellsberg. These are all government whistle blowers who went through the proper channels originally in an attempt to expose wrongdoing by government agencies. This included going to higher-ups in the organizations and contacting senate committees.

Where they had exhausted those avenues they then leaked their information to journalists. They leaked **only what was relevant to the wrongdoing**. Unlike Snowden and Manning they did not do a massive document dump of everything they could get their hands on. They specifically targeted certain programs.

I really can't fathom how people keep shouting about how the US has been locking away all whistleblowers when the vast majority of whistleblowers are still walking free and still openly criticizing the government from within the borders of the US. How is that in any way compatible with the narrative that the US is locking up and silencing all whistleblowers?

I think that if Snowden returned to the US he would be hit hard. But that is because he did not stop at whistleblowing on a specific program. He instigated a mass data dump of many programs, the majority of which had nothing to do with exposing potential wrongdoing. The majority was exposing international operations that he had a personal disagreement with but involved no wrongdoing in any way, shape or form.

Snowden's predicament was caused by nobody but himself. He could've released the documents on the domestic spying and stayed in the US.

I'd say it would be more down to transferrable skills. Kitchens want chefs with City &amp; Guilds as that's a guarantee that you're a skilled chef. An electrician has to have passed the book (IET Wiring Regulations) and generally will hold City &amp; Guilds. Plumbers likewise.

On the other hand, the much derided 'sandwich artist' post gets you a level 2 in Hospitality Services and a lot of that just won't be transferrable. Certain units are transferrable, but units like 'Prepare and Clear a service area for Takeaway Service' - not only is that a bobbins skill (oh look I can put some fucking napkins and cardboard boxes out), it's not really transferrable. Nor is it that impressive, honestly - every major quick service company has planograms for EVERYTHING so you don't need to know how to do it, just follow the planogram.

In comparison, a unit like 'prepare and cook meat and poultry' is a useful unit. It's transferrable, it covers the laws you need to follow when doing so, and it's not like there's a specifically Toby Carvery way of cooking a meat joint.

With or without the waiver you are indeed liable for injury you cause to others *to a certain extent*. That clause appears to be making it clear you cannot go to the organiser if you get sued for injuring someone.

Your opponant accepts the (frankly inevitable in boxing) risk of some injury and consents to that. The law recognises someone should find it hard to complain if the get injured in sport against someone playing the game. Liability could arise if you did something really left field - eg you dishonestly cheat in some way, or decided to jump out the ring and land on a spectator etc. 

It is always a good idea to look into third party liability insurance for these types of things - ask the organisers if they have a policy that can cover you, or look into your own.

null,false,whydoyouonlylie,null,null,null,"&gt;I believe that if you have signed an agreement between yourself and another nation which includes one or more sections about your operatives and what they can or can't do within your territory then you should be held to it.

Which agreement was signed that has this effect?

&gt; a long standing, friendly, diplomatic relationship

What is long standing? The majority of countries that are allies now have been so for less than a century in total, some even as little as a few decades. Is that ""long standing"" in the grand scheme of things given that some countries had been at war for centuries prior to that? (See France and the UK)

&gt;potentially other avenues exist for gathering this information.

Which avenues?

&gt;I also think on a deep psychological level, the majority of Germans don't pose much of a threat when it comes to ""not being an ally"" and are well aware that the rest of the world would take a dim view if they did decide to go it alone for a third time. The same applies to Japan.

So this is the hope and pray argument? Pretty sure that's also what a lot of people thought 1937-1939. ""Germany won't do it again. We just need to keep them satisfied and they won't try and go it alone again"" ... but they did. The Prime Minister of the UK came back from Germany in 1939 waving an ""agreement"" with the German government that was to avoid a war. They hoped that the Germans had learned their lesson from 1914-1918 that they couldn't go it alone and would co-operate. History tells us that didn't work out. Despite that are we still to operate on the hopes that we definitely know what the leadership of other countries must be thinking?",null,0,null,1434289072,null,0,false,0,cs65158,null,t3_39qx6i,null,t1_cs65158,null,t1_cs64rmc,null,null,null,1436989555,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

However, there are a few hidden Gatso cameras *behind* M25 gantries which *will* (and do) catch speeders.

The new HADECS3 gantry-mounted cameras are just one camera which can cover up to four lanes and DO NOT ~~HAVE~~ NEED ANY ROAD MARKINGS. *(Seems that lines are now being painted, perhaps for evidential reinforcement should they take a case to court.)* They're painted grey and are mounted on the left hand side of the gantry making them pretty much invisible. They're already live on the M1 and stretches of other motorways and will almost certainly rolled out elsewhere.

HADECS3 cameras are also Home Office Type Approved (HOTA) for enforcing the NSL __even if there are no gantry speed limits indicated.__

I'll give you a real world example this goes back to the 80s. 

My father belonged to a village golf club near the large town I grew up in. The golf club wasn't open to female members unless signed in by male players and there were no BME members despite the nearby town being highly diverse. It was in modern terms actually sexist and functionally racist even if the latter was only partially intentional.

My father was not wealthy, upper class, nor were the other club members, but his job involved the distribution of public money into building projects. All the work went to other club members, while deals were not done on the golf course the relationships that drove the decisions were made there and only there. The councillors who made decisions on projects were members too - all very cozy - not actually nor intentionally corrupt but functionally so.

Over 30 years that meant that enough public money to build around a quarter of a million housing units went to the denizens of one very small village golf club and seven or eight businesses located nearby. Those relationships persisted for more than a quarter of a century. That was just the way things were, and are, done. 

Basically there was a privileged power structure around the club which was both racist and sexist in some form and completely exclusionary.

This wasn't some well known gentlemen's club for the super rich, or a parliamentary cabal controlling the country, it was simply how things were done everywhere. The vestiges of that power structure remain - they are far less overt in the 21st century but they absolutely exist.

In short form all she did in a professional context was make a poor choice of words on a university twitter account 'white trash' which she admits was wrong, and ask white people not to attend a meeting specifically BME women. There were some additional tweets, but those were on a personal account, unconnected to her work and are indeed how that community expresses itself.

Copying and pasting this from a comment that I posted on a thread in r/soccer in reply to an Arsenal fan bashing Falcao. I think what I said then, and I'm sticking it to it now, explains why Man Utd fans and people in England in general are questioning Falcao's ability and are essentially declaring him to be declining: 

""Falcao has had ONE bad season after suffering a terrible knee injury. Not to mention he transferred to a new team that was in rebuilding mode on the last day of the transfer window, meaning he didn't have a chance to have a pre-season with Man Utd. He had to compete with RVP (I'm SURE you know who he is, since I see you're a gunner) and Wayne freaking Rooney for a spot. All while having to adapt to a league that is much more physical than other leagues he's played in before. Let's not forget he was playing in Ligue 1 for half a season.
2 years ago every single top team (including RM) was after Falcao and he was easily top 5 strikers in the world. Now all of a sudden people are saying he's shit and is a ""flop"".

Clearly everything that could've gone wrong for Falcao in the past year and a half, went wrong for him. To add to that mini-rant, he tried to rush back from the ACL injury to try and play in the WC, which hindered his play when he did start to train and play regularly once again. Let's also keep in mind that he was playing for LvG who is known for being strict tactically and having a very specific system. 

He is only 29 years old. His style of play was never about speed or skill, and those are the type of aspects that are affected by knee injuries. Falcao has always been the type of striker that had good positioning and had that ""goal-scorer's instinct"" if you will. If you watch him play with Man Utd, he was still making decent runs and was putting himself in the box when the midfield would bring the ball up. If anybody gets a chance, watch Colombia vs Venezuela later on today and pay attention to Falcao. He WILL get you goals when he play with players that actually look for him in the box and give him service. 

I think that with Mourinho's help he might not get back to his old self, but he will improve significantly. IMO he will be a better 3rd option than Drogba was last season (on the field, because Didier has no comparison in the dressing room). I'm thinking 10 goals or so in all competitions if he gets decent minutes.

I was never a Catherine Tait fan, I never have been.  her entire series, besides the Journey's End plot line, felt like she was hired to be on the show and no one told her it wasn't a sitcom.  She seemed like a charicature of a companion more suited to a Children In Need Doctor Who Spoof than the main show.  I just did not like her at ALL and Series 4 is the least re-watchable of the revived series (again besides the Journey's End/Stolen Earth plot which was awesome)

There's an acceptable, and perhaps not too unhealthy, middle ground though, right? Between not drinking at all and forcing people to dance and having screaming matches and throwing up? 

Consider a few good friends stopping off at local pubs. They might play a game of darts, join a pub quiz or, more likely, sit and talk about stuff. Family, jobs... they might make plans for the future or argue about politics. Whatever interests them.

After the first pint and maybe an hour, inhibitions are just *a bit* lower, everyone feels very comfortable and if the drinking is nice and slow, it stays like that for a while. Tipsy, if you like. They get chatting to a chap at the bar who tells a few interesting anecdotes.

By the end of the evening, walking home, maybe it's a bit difficult to stay in a straight line; maybe they are inclined to laugh at jokes that aren't really that funny.

I don't see that any great harm has been done there. I don't feel that our hypothetical group of friends should feel there's anything wrong with that. It might not be *healthy*, but then neither are any number of other things that people do. I tend not to worry about it too much.

&gt; costs for things like ink and textbooks and my phone bill shouldn't exceed £100 a month

Sorry if that read messily, I meant that anything that I'd have to buy, printer ink, printer paper, the odd textbook, my phone bill £21 a month, currently, toiletries, etc shouldn't exceed £100 a month.

I have an iPhone and my contract covers unlimited texts and calls, as well as 7GB of data, which I regularly use to tether to my laptop when out of reach of wifi.

I currently have a macbook pro that I got for free because my old one was dying and as a severely dyslexic student, my uni gave me a laptop with a lot of assistive software that helps me to read. It has amazingly helped me improve a lot.


I'm hoping to find a flatshare where bills are paid communally... I didn't even think about contents insurance, thank you for bringing that up. Oh man, being a grow up is terrifying. While in halls, my mum's insurance covered my laptop, I think. I'll see if hers can cover my stuff if I pay an additional portion.

&gt;Some people find it easier / safer to only spend using a credit/debit card. You can track all your purchases online and, if you lose your wallet, you won't have lost all the cash in it. I understand that you may be reticent to that idea, if so, withdraw small amounts of money from the ATM as and when you need it.

You're totally right, I never have more than £15 in cash on me at any time. I used to keep an emergency £10 in my phone case and £5 in coins in my purse should I need it, but all my spending is on my debit card, as it forces me to be accountable for everything that I spend, and helps me to track it. I also don't have to worry about losing loads of cash.


I find it a bit hard to treat myself, it is such an ingrained habit to order tapwater everywhere and the cheapest item on the menu when out, but I would rather end the year with slightly more than none of my savings left than none left and having enjoyed it a bit more. It is only a year, I guess.

I have a pretty active social life, and most of the time I'm hanging with my friends and it is free, so it is all good :)

I'm fairly sure the Government (especially the current one) would apply the same rules to EU migrants if they could.

But this income requirement is shutting out a lot of expats who've been living in cheaper countries on lower wages and want to return.

Even if someone meets the requirements, it costs thousands just to go through the whole process, to get to the point where after two or five years you're entitled to state funds like everyone else.

What I'm a little iffy on is cases where someone wants to die to preserve their own dignity. Even if I was crippled from the neck down I'd try to claw back as much quality of life as I could, and keep going. Same with old age. I don't think people should hit e.g. 90 and decide to die even if theres nothing wrong with them. But on the other hand there are cases where people do have such a severe drop in quality of life they want to end it on their own terms. I'd lean 'for' in these cases, but with serious reservations.

One thing I would also be very very wary of is people in end of life (or other) situations being pressurised or even just feeling like they have to choose the euthanasia option to stop being a burden to people. Good access to improved pallative care needs to be available and in place before we start allowing for euthanasia.

null,false,FinalEdit,null,null,null,"&gt; the BBC does have adverts, they just advertise the BBC, there's literally no fucking difference

Bull. Sorry but that's completely different. Promoing your own content is 100% different than advertising a product. For one, the content of the program that the advert is in front of won't be influenced by the promo. Do you really think Mercedes would pay £100k to advertise it's latest car off the back of an episode of Top Gear that has just rubbished it? No. When advertising funding becomes a huge part of the revenue stream, advertisers will demand content that produces the most viewers. Do you really think Blue Peter would show kids how to make stuff when advertisers want kids to buy their latest toys rather than entertain themselves? Do you think Newsround would exist on ITV? Because it hasn't. (OK so there was Art Attack, but it was cancelled years ago, so was How2)

Also your argument about quality of shows sounds valid but it falls apart when you realise that people will watch all manner of shite like Keeping Up With the Kardashians. This populist notion of ratings driven content simply forces out the vast majority of stuff that not only entertains but provides a valuable **public service.** How many exposes have there been by Panorama? Hundreds. How many Newsnight investigations have turned up issues which have affected the political landscape of this country? A shit ton. The arguments for the BBCs programming goes much deeper than just ratings and popularity. 

Name me one fucking channel aside from the BBC that exposed Scientology for the aggressive cult it is, for instance.

null,false,convertedtoradians,null,null,null,"&gt; He was convicted of a crime so there are victims

Well, no. That doesn't follow. That he was *convicted* of a crime means just that; that he was convicted. That the evidence was presented and a jury decided that he was guilty of the crimes he stood accused of. It doesn't mean that his guilt is an unquestionable, absolute truth of the universe like the law of gravity.

It's a subtle distinction, but an important one.

While I don't think it's particularly helpful to re-run trials in the papers (or on Twitter or reddit come to that) and while I'm certainly not advocating Harris' innocence, I think it's important to recognise that the legal system does have its failings, that innocent people *are* sometimes wrongly locked up.

Criminal trials sometimes *aren't* like the moon landings or climate change deniers or something, where there is an astonishingly large body of evidence universally accepted by experts. A lot of them boil down to eyewitness testimony and human memory which are perfectly fallible (e.g. [1](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4177082.stm) [2](http://agora.stanford.edu/sjls/Issue%20One/fisher&amp;tversky.htm) [3](http://www.simplypsychology.org/eyewitness-testimony.html) for some articles).

There are, statistically, some people in British prisons today who have been found guilty of committing a crime but who haven't actually broken any laws and who have no victims (edit:) and there are also certainly people who have never been found guilty of committing any crimes but who have victims whose lives have been ruined.

Harris was found guilty by the best system we have for determining such things. He should remain in prison until his sentence is up, or he is found to no longer pose a risk to society, or his conviction is no longer found to be valid, but I'm not sure that ""believing the truth"" plays a role here.",null,0,null,1434295552,null,0,false,0,cs67ldh,null,t3_39t1dw,null,t1_cs67ldh,null,t1_cs672i5,null,null,null,1436991493,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

On to some finer points, you called *Doctor Who* a children's show. Maybe I'm just sensitive about the programme and didn't like it to be labelled like that, but I would say that was unfair. It would be more accurately called a family show, since that is what's target audience is, and not just children. 
Also, calling David Tennant the fandom's favourite Doctor was... brave, to say the least. 


But it was good, even if I may not have totally agreed with most of your opinions, but that's okay.

... Michael's father, William, upon meeting with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, reported that talks were amicable, but no final decision had been made. ""Michael is a talented young man, but we are looking for a club that can match his ambitions,"" Schultz said. ""We need to know that Liverpool are ready to offer the highest level of competition by 2020.""

When Rodgers was asked about his meeting with the bright young talent, he showed clear excitement. ""He showed great character in our meeting today,"" Rodgers was quoted as saying. ""He is the kind of technical player you don't see every day coming from South Africa, a real technician of the ball. He has a tireless work ethic that would be a perfect fit for the club. Mpumalanga Black Aces is a wonderful club with a rich history, and I think Michael will feel right at home at Anfield.""

John Henry could not be reached for comment, but Tom Werner replied to the imminent signing of this hot young prospect. ""He's the kind of player we're looking to sign. That's what we're looking for -- players who fit into our philosophy, players who will help us build for the future.""

It is reported that contract negotiations are ongoing, but thought to be in the region of $40,000/week, to piss off Raheem Sterling.

I mean, let's be clear, the troubles were not simply about a united Ireland, they were about the atrocious treatment of Catholics in NI. That often goes hand in hand with republicanism, but the two are not so closely connected as all that. Rather, a united Ireland was the simplest and most obvious solution to the problem of British and loyalist mistreatment of Irish Catholics. There are plenty of folks that would be happy to be part of Ireland or the UK, as long as they were treated equally under the law, in society and in politics. They may prefer one or the other, of course.

It is my opinion that had the UK overridden the objections of the loyalist thugs and enacted home rule as promised, and supported that home rule government, we might today be in a united Ireland as a willing part of the Union, much as Scotland is. They didn't of course.

I think a bunch of that is just arguing over semantics and it's not really my primary concern. It'll piss some people off but as long as I can get my opinion across right and produce a fair review based on my own thoughts then I'm happy.

It makes me a better, more honest reviewer and I'm not one to shout down anyone else's opinion either. I'm glad you enjoyed it and didn't just shout me down because of that :)

EDIT: Oh yeah and about lumping all of the series into one review, I did it because it would take me a LONG time to get reviews done for every individual season.

When I was being processed in and having some of my clothes and other personal effects taken off me and booked in (they take everything except your bottom layer and pants); the officer saw my self harm cuts on my arm after I took off my hoodie. As soon as they saw that, I was taken for a strip search incase I had something I could use to harm myself hidden somewhere. Afterwards I was placed in a cell with a police officer sitting in the doorway telling me off and threatening me with restraints if I didn't stop picking at my cuts. 

The officer remained there until a nurse was happy that I wasn't suicidal, even after that the cell had CCTV in it, and I was physically checked every 30 mins (I think, I had no idea what time it was, and since I was trying to get some sleep it got annoying to have the hatch bang) 

I am not going to speculate about what happened, its the IPCC's job, it could be coincidental or anything. The custody officer will be going through hell at the moment, since they are responsible for detainees welfare.

Thats just my experience anyway, IMO they do everything they can to ensure the welfare of people in custody. Its an incredibly scary experience for your first time (I was 19), hearing a cell door shut and lock with you on the inside sends shivers down your spine...

null,false,Alunnite,,Flintshire,null,"Welsh are good at drinking. Just looked up some stats and apparantly 19% of Wales ""binge drink"". Unfortunately we don't make the best drinks Brains is our biggest international brand of beer and its a pile of shit. There are a few decent breweries (especially in Wrexham and the Valley/South Wales area) but I doubt there isn't much internal demand. So if you ever come around then just grab a local beer and see if you like it or not. If you like whisky then check out some of the Penderyn stuff. Unlike Brains its actually good. So just drink what ever you want, as long as its in excess. 

Food wise the Welsh don't really do much either. As North Walian currently living in South I have found people are much more about welsh cakes down south and I had more in my three years here than I have had in my life beofre hand. The only other food I can think of is Welsh Rarebit which may not even be welsh, leek soup, and laverbread which is all pretty homely food and nothing worth bragging about. I will give a shoutout to Snowdonia Chesse though, its good fucking cheese!

The most unifying part of wales of Wales is the rugby (even if south wales does take all the glory :P). Who doesn't love a good game of rugby union? And the songs we sing are great; bread of heaven, Delilah, and I geunally belive that the [Welsh national anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM4mIlYKG9s) is one of the bets in the world, probably in the top 5. 

In terms of nationalism I hardly ever refer to myself as British, and always say Welsh when I can. I don't really wanted to be lumped in the English and avoid it when I can. Plus has always a friendly rivalry  between the English and Welsh. 

According to Wikipedia USA was a 0.6% population of Welsh-American and a 10.5% Irish-american population, that's just not worth making a fuss about. Welsh cultural events include the Six Nations and that's pretty much it. In my experience very few people care about dydd gwyl dewi sant, the eisteddfod, or dydd santes dwynwen. Seen much more welsh people celebrate saint paddy's day.

Unfortunately welsh is a dying language so not many people speak it with  ~20% of the country being able to speak it. Most of it is around the [western edge of wales](http://www.electoralgeography.com/new/en/wp-content/gallery/wales1997/1997-wales-referendum5.png) so if you want to experience that then that's the place to go. Wales is smaller than New Jersey so if that seems small to you then you could easily visit the entire country over a relatively short period. It takes about 3.5 hours to go from north wales to south on the train so its not that big a place. It would like to highlight some places. Cardiff obviously being the capital city and one of the only places welsh money goes to, or more specifically Cardiff Bay. There should be plenty of stuff to look at online if you want to visit. Like /u/XUD9TE suggested Anglesy is a fabulas place to go. There are some [great places to visit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wales/comments/21b9s8/i_am_spending_a_week_in_anglesey_next_month_what/) but I don't know if it could keep anyone entertained for more than a day or two. I would recommend places like Llangollen, Llandudno, Harlech, Bala, and defo go take a trip to Snowdon. If you like castles then the ones that standout to me are Cardiff Castle,  Conwy Castle, and Caerphilly Castle which has a tower that leans twice as much as Pisa and I think its regularly ignored as being one of the largest castles in the world.",null,0,null,1434299508,null,0,false,0,cs69gts,null,t3_39plpy,null,t1_cs69gts,null,t3_39plpy,null,null,null,1436992921,null,1,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,1,null

The rason I ask is that there is a limit on how long you can leave things like this - depending on precisely how your MiL makes the claim, it could be 12 years (unlikely) or 6 years (much more likely)[1].

If it's been more than 6 years since any debt was acknowledged, the legally prudant thing to do would be to say something like ""without prejudice to our position as to the existance of the debt, we point out a) the last date any debt was acknowledged was on &lt;xxx&gt;, and b) the Limitation Act 1980"".  However, this is a legalise for ""fuck you""[2], which might make the relationship with your MiL rather tricky going forward.  I guess the real question is:  what do you want to happen?  How badly are you willing to damage the relationship with your MiL to get it?  How badly are you willing to damage the realtionship with your wife to get it?  These aren't legal questions, of course.

[1] pedantically it can be less, but I think it's pretty much impossible for those situations to apply here.

&gt;It may be interesting, then, to place before our readers the Socialist Republican conception of the functions and uses of physical force in a popular movement. We neither exalt it into a principle nor repudiate it as something not to be thought of. Our position towards it is that the use or non-use of force for the realisation of the ideas of progress always has been and always will be determined by the attitude, not of the party of progress, but of the governing class opposed to that party. **If the time should arrive when the party of progress finds its way to freedom barred by the stubborn greed of a possessing class entrenched behind the barriers of law and order; if the party of progress has indoctrinated the people at large with the new revolutionary conception of society and is therefore representative of the will of a majority of the nation, if it has exhausted all the peaceful means at its disposal for the purpose of demonstrating to the people and their enemies that the new revolutionary ideas do possess the suffrage of the majority; then, but not till then**, the party which represents the revolutionary idea is justified in taking steps to assume the powers of government, and in using the weapons of force to dislodge the usurping class or government in possession, and treating its members and supporters as usurpers and rebels against the constituted authorities always have been created. In other words, Socialists believe that the question of force is of very minor importance; the really important question is of the principles upon which is based the movement that may or may not need the use of force to realise its object.

&gt;**The ballot-box was given us by our masters for their purpose; let us use it for our own.** Let us demonstrate at that ballot-box the strength and intelligence of the revolutionary idea; let us make the hustings a rostrum from which to promulgate our principles; let us grasp the public powers in the interest of the disinherited class; let us emulate our fathers and, like the ‘true men of ’98,’ place ourselves in line with the most advanced thought of our age and drawing inspiration and hope from the spectacle presented by the world-wide revolt of the workers, prepare for the coming of the day when the Socialist working-class of Ireland will, through its elected representatives, present its demand for freedom from the yoke of a governing master class or nation – the day on which the question of moral or physical force shall be finally decided. - [James Connolly, *Physical Force in Irish Politics* (1899)](https://www.marxists.org/archive/connolly/1899/07/physforc.htm)",null,0,null,1434300312,null,0,false,0,cs69tav,null,t3_39se8q,null,t1_cs69tav,null,t3_39se8q,null,null,null,1436993164,null,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2,null

The Sunday Times article is [behind a paywall](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/National/article1568673.ece), but you can read it [here](http://pastebin.com/mgADBP9K).

The BBC also reported on this story, which is being discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/39qx6i/uk_agents_moved_over_snowden_files_bbc_news/).

Ryan Gallagher, who writes for The Intercept (and previously for The Guardian and Financial Times) and has had access to the files, has posted an interesting deconstruction of the claims made in the Sunday Times article [here](http://notes.rjgallagher.co.uk/2015/06/sunday-times-snowden-china-russia-questions.html).

Not surprisingly, The Intercept are very unhappy about the claims made in the Sunday Times article. They have posted a rebuttal [here](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/06/14/sunday-times-report-snowden-files-journalism-worst-also-filled-falsehoods/) (discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/39t2oi/the_sunday_times_snowden_story_is_journalism_at/)).

It looks like a Murdoch-owned newspaper is being used to propagate unsubstantiated (and from my point of view unrealistic) claims made by government officials about Snowden and his files. Aside from a lack of evidence and some factual errors in the Sunday Times article, the timing of these ""revelations"" seems to be particularly convenient given the [emerging story](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/13/snoopers-charter-theresa-may-refuse-to-share) about how the British Government is planning to ignore one of the major recommendations of the Anderson report (re. authorisation of surveillance operations by the judiciary as opposed to by government ministers), and the fact that Teresa May has been keeping the latest version of the draft text of the Snooper's Charter secret from law enforcement agencies.

The replies from Downing Street and the intelligence agencies contained in this article by The Guardian are laughable:

&gt; *A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “We don’t comment on leaks.” The intelligence agencies said: “Our longstanding policy is not to comment on intelligence matters.”*

Yet, strangely enough, The Sunday Times was, in the article linked above, able to obtain comments from ""senior officials in Downing Street, the Home Office and the security services"".

I wish the government would just be honest and say: ""Our longstanding policy is not to comment on intelligence matters, except when it is in our own interest to spread disinformation by making unsubstantiated comments to sections of the media with which we enjoy a cosy relationship.""

The Sunday Times article, and the statements made by anonymous Downing Street officials, look like nothing other than a childish attempt at propaganda and distraction from the Tories' plans to continue to ride roughshod over the civil liberties of British citizens.",null,0,null,1434300321,null,0,1434309327,0,cs69th9,null,t3_39tg0s,null,t1_cs69th9,null,t3_39tg0s,null,null,null,1436993171,null,42,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,42,null

With that being said: 

According to [the picture from the Wikipedia page you linked,](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia_law#/media/File:Use_of_Sharia_by_country.svg) there are eight countries where Sharia is applied in full; Marituana, Sudan, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Afganistan and Pakistan. [According to Wikipedia, these countries have a total Muslim population of less than 400 million, nowhere near a majoirty of the # of Muslims worldwide.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_by_country) The majority of Muslims don't live in countries where Sharia is applied in full. 

I couldn't find the number of people asked in the survey you posted from Policy Exchange, but I did see one number where they spoke to just over a thousand Muslims. ([This is the report that 61% was taken from, number I'm quoting is on page 20](http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/living%20apart%20together%20-%20jan%2007.pdf)) Page linked above says UK hads over 2.8m Muslims, so 1,000 is less than a tenth of a percent of the total population, so is nearly as unrepresentative of Muslims as a whole as all the fuckin articles that got us into this in the first place.

&gt;I can use ISIS because they exist for one reason, to spread Islam and create a caliphate while enforcing Sharia law without compromise, not to get rid of westerners like other terrorist groups did.

ISIS has been/is being supported by our own secret services, the CIA, the Turkish secret service and numerous others, as it is a massive thorn in the side of Assad's government, a proxy enemy of the aforementioned. There are many, many articles and reports that have proved this, I will gladly source them if you want. 

&gt;They have support because people believe in it, if it was about the war why didn't other terrorist groups have support like ISIS do?

What we called the Mujahideen had support, the Taliban had support, Al-Qaeda had support, it's splinter groups definitely have support. These are all groups set up with many different aims, not just the spread of Islam.

&gt;Islam is very clear on a lot of these bad things and it's set up in such a way that makes it seem like you have to believe it all or nothing and you can't question anything because that would be blasphemy and punishable by death...

I agree, fundamental Islam is very absolutist, and the fact the Quran is believed to be the literal word of God makes it very hard to challenge. I do, however, think that the majority of Muslims are not fundamentalists, and do not follow the word of the Quran to a T.

&gt;So the fact remains that Islam in it's current state is inherently bad and the good Muslims are still a tiny minority, it has a long way to go to be like Christianity.

I don't really want to get back into Islam vs Christianity but Islam is a good 600 years younger than Christianity, and it is far more prominent in more empovrished/wartorn sections of the world. At it's core, Christianity is still just as fucked up as any other religion, it's just that the people who call themselves Christians are actually massively more relaxed about their faith, if indeed they actually practice at all (which the majority don't).",null,0,null,1434300405,null,0,false,0,cs69uw5,null,t3_39kaqn,null,t1_cs69uw5,null,t1_cs56r1h,null,null,null,1436993186,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I don't respond to their letters and don't intend to entertain them on my doorstep.

I sold my TV, recycled my Sky box and made a blanking box for the aerial socket. I don't use iPlayer or NetFlix etc but I do watch video on Youtube.

BTW Sky got very upset when I called to cancel. I think the operatives are penalised if the customer cancels. I also ended up making one extra payment to them by cheque.

Immigration at these levels that haven't been seen before in history, has also placed stress on our healthcare, housing, welfare, and schooling (another 100K primary school pupils up from last year's number, for example).

Again, immigration of skilled workers, and not of hordes of people without money of skills, is what's good.

The reason immigration control *exists* in most countries, is because it is well documented that immigration when uncontrolled causes these problems, and also social unrest as the natives and foreigners experience rising social tensions.

Here's what he actually said:

&gt; Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday, Hunt apologised for any offence, saying he meant the remarks to be humorous – but added he “did mean the part about having trouble with girls”.

&gt;He said: “It is true … I have fallen in love with people in the lab and people in the lab have fallen in love with me and it’s very disruptive to the science because it’s terribly important that in a lab people are on a level playing field.

&gt;“I found that these emotional entanglements made life very difficult. I’m really, really sorry I caused any offence, that’s awful. I certainly didn’t mean that. **I just meant to be honest, actually.”**

You **can not** say that women are a hindrance in science labs because ""when you criticize them they cry"" and then defend yourself by saying you were just trying to be honest.

It was quite telling that people were glad to see the end of the Commonwealth once Richard Cromwell was in charge. Cromwell was more or less the only thing that kept the new state together, which is a testament to his skills as a leader and his dangerously violent nature.

I've been to germany, and have german friends. There are some parts of Berlin that you wouldn't even know were in germany by the looks of it there. Tons of immigrants. You bringing up 2 countries almost identical to Britain, and both in the EU, does not serve your point. Look at the problems France is having with Islam, and immigrants trying to sneak into Britain from Calais for example.

And the reason we don't see the media reporting on it there, is because they shy away from the issue even more than we do. Next, you'll try to tell me Sweden is ""just fine"" when that country has been ruined by immigration and ""progressive"" policy.

And Britain doesn't have an ageing population - Germany does. In fact, Germany just fell behind Japan as the country with the lowest birthrate in the world, and their progressive policies are to blame.

Sorry, but your argument doesn't stand up at all. Btw, the country I was talking about is India. No problem with birthrate or immigration there, no one complains that there isn't enough white people, and no one has this pro-immigration attitude, despite the student research exchange programmes (which again, are offered because well educated, skilled people are welcome to immigrate).

I'm sorry you drank the immigration kool-aid, but the fact is, multiculturalism doesn't work, and history has shown it has never worked. We can see with the rise of EDL marches, that even the uneducated, working class young people are starting to feel alienated in parts of their own nation

To be criticised and resign for making offensive comments has nothing to do with 1984. First point, 1984 was about *state* control of thought, firstly, the state had nothing to do with any of this, secondly this wasn't about thought this was about public speech. So let's just lay that aside, and pretend its not *monstrously* fucking stupid to bring up the spectre of 1984 over this when we have real issues of secret injunctions, mass surveillance and illegal prisons. 


The real unforgivable stupidity about this conservative woman is that she's got no fucking clue what she's going on about when it comes to science, or in fact any work environment. Women can and do work in offices all over the country, and you know what? They manage to get work done and contribute without being segregated into separate offices. The problem with his remarks aren't that *no women have ever cried* - it's that you can't generalise over the entire female gender and suggest they should be segregated for it. It's an abusively stupid comment - but what's worse is that we actually know this man has been in charge of recruiting scientists - so the next question is much worse. If this is what he thinks, then how many times has he passed over a woman because of his stupid personal views. 


It's one of the continuing, ongoing problems of the right, is that they simply don't get the mainstream logic. In this case, we have criticisized a man for expressing deeply sexist views and we've wondered whether having a sexist man in a position of power in an institution which already has a problem attracting female stupids. There's simply no relation to religious doctrine. There's simply no comparison, we're not adhering to pre-determined rules, we've not criticised him for something he can't control.

Immigrants try to sneak into britian because the UK benefits system is seen as a soft touch.

They need to stop being the party of whatever social justice cause is going and start addressing the actual problems with our economy with some policies.

Yup. And why do we need to resort to physical violence?

Have some creativity; since you think violence is the answer here are some alternatives; I have no idea how old your children are so here's a range.  

- Remove the power cable from their games console / TV.  

- Change the wifi password.   

- Replace their junk food and soda with celery and tap water.  

- Cut off their phone bill.  

- Make them do extra maths work, with an abacus instead of a calculator.  

- Make them read the most boring book you can find out loud.  

- Impose a curfew.   

- (for teenagers, partiularly boys) Turn on the ISP parental filters. Block all VPNs.

- Make them take the bus to school instead of driving.  

- Make them watch awful educational programming from the 1980s [The Wales Bank, for an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsDYcYzqKt0).  

- Make them write an essay on why what they did was wrong.  

- No TV or games until a book report on (insert classic here) has been given to you and marked.  


There are plenty of effective punishments that don't resort to the lowest form of human conflict resolution, which as you said, is against the law.

Unlike Arsenal fans, I am going to openly admit right now that some of players are injury prone (aka Remy and Costa) and we need to prepare for that. Drogba wound up playing a lot more than any of us probably expected. I don't want to throw 150k/wk at a charity case because he used to be good and Mourinho wants to make a point. Bringing back Drogba wasn't about reviving his career, it was about bringing in his leadership in the locker room to replace Lampard. Again, Falcao won't be providing that.

FYI: $1 = £0.64, so things will seem more expensive here than they do in the US. However, some things are priced different compared to the US and when you figure out the best places to shop then you'll do alright. 

Why are you moving to Edinburgh &amp;amp; what area are you moving to? 

I think you will find Edinburgh more advanced than most places in the US unless you're already from a major city. Cycling is fine but there are plenty of busses that will get you anywhere. There's also trams, and rail links to the rest if the country/UK. The city centre is pretty accessible by foot if you don't mind hills. 
Yes, yelp works here. Edinburgh is probably the most popular place it's used thanks to all the tourists. 
And yes there are plenty of non touristy places to visit. You can also drink the tap water no problem.

this is the mentality that needs to be changed.

From what you mentioned. I agree that few people change. The rest won't want to, and will definitely poke/coerce/force their mates to do something ""wrong"" with them at some point in their life. 

I don't want the country to be like those Muslim nations (correct me if i'm wrong) where punishment for crimes are extreme (chopping off hands or other body parts/pelting or lashes). I simply want kids to know that what ever they do, they will have to take it with them to their graves.

Say, if the kid in this case stabbed the teacher, the kid should be tried as an adult irrespective of age.

If kids are dealing drugs or take part in animal abuse, or elderly abuse, their IDs should be flagged in some kind of a national db, where their profile would be flagged by every government agency or job agency; making it extremely difficult to get social services, food, high security jobs, etc.

It does sound extreme, but if it strikes fear in the hearts of young, then I believe that there is a chance that the kids would think thrice before they act.",null,0,null,1434306157,null,0,false,0,cs6cswd,null,t3_39pwzo,null,t1_cs6cswd,null,t1_cs6c74t,null,null,null,1436995549,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

We're definitely inconsequential when it comes to transfers! Look at Alonso? He was worshipped here and he went because of Rafa.

&gt;  for instance if say raheem goes for x-million and that is then re-invested in questionable signings that don't pan out, the manager would once again be under huge pressure(and in this case, likely sacked because of fan outrage)

Torres money? Suarez money? Alonso money? People get over that sort of thing, he wouldn't be sacked as a result of it. He'd only be sacked if the team doesn't do well over the course of the season and if he doesn't hit the targets set by FSG.

&gt; As soon as we ""give up"" , and sheerly out of boredom at that, we definitely look worse off...

Stop it, Raheem is a mercenary, he's not interested in the club or football, it's clear that money is where his mind is at.

We have always moved on after losing players, heck Raheem isn't even at the top level yet, we have replaced genuinely world class players time and time again, Raheem isn't world class he's potential. We'll definitely be able to replace him and in a few years time nobody will give a fuck.

I think it blows the minds of Australasians the way European countries obviously encourage such lawlessness - and do so on almost a purely racial basis, e.g. one law for white natives, and another (almost absent) law for coloured people in large swarms.

Generally you can always divorce without jurisdictional concerns in the state/county they live in if they have been there at least 6 months or so-- depends on the state how long.

The Hague Convention may alter all of this (or a separate treaty with the UK), which is why I'm not totally sure if you can't just divorce her in the UK.

As far as your son, child custody and support are a bit different.  Probably New Jersey would consider itself to be the only proper jurisdiction if he was born there and never lived anywhere else.  (Again, a treaty may alter this though.)  So that's why I think handling it in NJ would likely be your best bet.

Gas prices in the US at one point can vary anywhere between 2-5 USD/ Gallon depending on local factors. Milk in California is far more expensive than other states that don't have the same requirement that dairy be in state. Corn in the Midwest is literally the least expensive thing--cheaper than water, flour, everything. A beer from a bar in NY will be much more than the same beer in Indy simply because NY bars can charge more.  All of this even though 1 USD= 1 USD. Local factors like agriculture, legislation, average income, culture, and tourism have an effect on prices too. 

I would like to know in at least *some* detail what changes in costs to expect.

My personal opinion is that £18,000 isn't actually too high a price to pay, British citizenship is a privilege and has been given away too cheaply for too long.

null,false,lfcsavolver,null,null,null,"&gt;We're definitely inconsequential when it comes to transfers! Look at Alonso? He was worshipped here and he went because of Rafa. 

Yes he went because of rafa but like suarez he'd been a loyal servant for a long time and thus there was a greater respect for those situations as opposed to this one amongst the fans. There would have been more backlash if not.  

&gt;Torres money? Suarez money? Alonso money? People get over that sort of thing, he wouldn't be sacked as a result of it. He'd only be sacked if the team doesn't do well over the course of the season and if he doesn't hit the targets set by FSG.

Sure, but he needs the players in the squad to be good enough to hit those targets. the suarez money was reinvested and we didn't hit those targets. now with even less money we're suddenly going to do it? there's absolutely no reason to feel **confident** that we will. We're not in a position to attract top talent right now. you might say raheem isnt there yet, and i'd agree, but he shows every sign that he could be. And so it's a case of one thing leads to another. One of our best players jumping ship will certainly have an effect on the rest of the squad, and not a positive one. No matter how you look at it, it translates to more pressure on rodgers who, many still feel isn't the right man for the job anyway.

&gt;we'll get a great fee for him and we'll move on

What would you consider to be a good fee? i'm not liking a lot of the numbers being thrown about. not to mention 20% goes straight to QPR. We have every right to bleed them dry...

&gt;Raheem going is not the be all and end all of LFC

Now **you** stop it. I never even suggested it was. But the public backlash of a **20 yr old** and his jackass of an agent getting away with doing this to us can in no way help us, it can only hurt. and i'd prefer not to dismiss those negative ramifications as part of a ""we'll cross that bridge when we come to it"" type strategy.

I've not heard them all myself - by any means. However a lot of folk recommend *Spare Parts* as one of the top stories altogether.

A popular place to start is with the Eighth Doctor, and you can either go for the stories in the main range, starting with [*Storm Warning*](http://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/storm-warning-641) - these are older, cheaper and more like Classic Who is style, or with the Eighth Doctor Adventures range, and start with [*Blood of the Daleks*](http://www.bigfinish.com/search_results?txtSearch=blood+of+the+daleks&amp;x=0&amp;y=0). These are more like NuWho and start a run with a new companion - Lucie Miller - that includes some of the best individual tales and one of most dramatic conclusions anywhere in DW.

Anyone who saw the children of the Westboro Baptist Church would be mad not to feel some overwhelming sympathy for those kids who were in an abusive and bigoted environment that they have been brought up in.

Sympathy becomes pity as soon as those people grow to adulthood...I mean there's a fine line between the two when you look at idiot racists and violent bigots. Meeting them back with a similar hate isn't exactly conducive to harmony though.

&gt;The trial heard that Munshi was desperate to go and fight and went by the online name of ""fidadee"", meaning a ""person ready to sacrifice himself"".

&gt;He also had a discussion with Khan, via an internet messaging service, about how someone might smuggle a sword through airport security.

&gt;When Munshi was arrested, two bags of ball-bearings – the shrapnel of choice for suicide bombers – were found in one of his pockets . 

&gt;As officers searched an empty house in Greenwood Street, which he claimed was his home address, a package containing hunting knives was delivered for him.

&gt;His wallet included the hand-written dimensions for a sub-machine gun, the illustration taken from a book called Expedient Home-made Firearms.

There's pretty clear rules about what you legally can and can't watch. The TV licencing site has a page on it. It's down atm, otherwise I'd link to it, but it basically boils down to ""you can't watch TV broadcast live on any channel or service"".

The reason we cancelled ours was, after moving house we discovered there was no aerial attached anywhere. Cabling was present as though there was an aerial, but - no aerial. We didn't have cable TV, and I'd just ordered a new tivo-like box, but after scratching my head for a while trying to get it working I finally went up in the loft and discovered the cables went nowhere.

We got threatening letters every couple of months, I think because I'd purchased the recorder box and they're obligated to report purchases of that kind of device to the TV licencing folks. After ignoring a few letters, we got someone come knock on the door. We let them in, explained that we didn't ever watch live TV, and the guy flicked though the TV channels (all static), dug around behind the box, realised there was no aerial cable plugged in, tried plugging it in and eventually came to the conclusion that we couldn't actually get broadcast TV.

We're back on licence now, as the kids go berko without their cbeebies (although iPlayer and Netflix are actually mostly enough to solve that problem). I could live without it fine, my other half likes watching broadcast TV for some reason.

Are you implying they are not human? Jesus Christ. They may not want to come to Britain for good reasons but they are still human beings.  

And if you looked up the stats (I'm not on my PC at the moment so I can't paste it over) you'd find that EU migrants have been a contribution overall. This has been repeatedly proven.  

But like I said; you obviously don't particularly like immigration, so vote UKIP whenever there are elections, vote ""no"" and pressure the government to reverse globalisation; promoting a more isolationist approach instead. It's the only way you're going to see the system you want.

Tricks used by the guy who took my day were interesting actually. Everything he did was geared towards getting me to invest more time/money and belief in the job (because then it is harder to recognise that its shit and give up, because you feel 'you've come this far'). 

He said, lets do a one day trial. Then as soon as we started, he completely stopped mentioning the day trial and started talking about doing a week trial because then I'd be able to see improvement. He said he wanted me to buy a diary the next day, and a better suit.

Then started talking about this offer he does on a 2 week trial where he offers £300 to people at the end of the two week trial to leave the job and none of them take it because they've realised the money making potential of this job.

At the end of the day when I said I wouldn't be coming back tomorrow, he tried for about 10 minutes to persuade me, increasingly aggressively.

null,false,VettelS,null,null,null,"&gt; The BBC could and should limit iPlayer access to licence fee payers. They could also limit access to the whole site if they liked.

The problem with this model is that it's expensive to implement and prone to error/misuse. Also, if you were to prevent people accessing the BBC News website, the BBC would arguably cease to be a ""public service"".

&gt; That the BBC is unwilling to enforce the licence system properly isn't much of a reason to force the costs onto everyone.

I think that currently, it is enforced properly, but it's out-of-date. The problem is that many people avoid paying it by only watching programmes on iPlayer after they've been broadcast - or at least, they claim to. The only reason that this is allowed is because the license fee has existed far longer than Internet video streaming has; if the BBC were being created today, you'd surely need a license in order to stream programmes. The number of people who use iPlayer for this purpose is going to continue to increase, so a way needs to be found to get those people to contribute.

And as I said, the number of people who don't consume any BBC content *whatsoever*, must absolutely tiny. This is why I think the BBC should be funded out of general taxation. It's cheap to ""administer"", doesn't require costly enforcement or a subscription model, and the contribution per person would be less than the current price of a TV license.",null,0,null,1434314859,null,0,false,0,cs6h7z8,null,t3_39rutb,null,t1_cs6h7z8,null,t1_cs69wst,null,null,null,1436999158,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Same with Australia: people who want to live there usually save up some money to support themselves, because the Australians are strict.

No I'm not? just because i acknowledged rafa had a big hand in xabi leaving does not mean i didn't address the fans role in all of it. I say again it was a very different situation to this one. 

&gt;How? Really, how will this hurt us in the long run? Every club in the prem has had similar issues with players, you're overreacting, you really shouldn't.

This isn't over reacting dude. It's discussing, and i'm not pulling my hair out over you or sterling i promise you. Anyway i didn't say anything about short term or long term(you did that). All i said was it can only hurt us. It would be yet another reason why top talents wouldn't want to come to us if we can't hold on to our players, even when they are 20 years of age. similarly it will set a bad example for the many other young players we have in our current squad. It sends a bad signal all around, i thought that was obvious... 

&gt;Welcome to /r/liverpoolfc[1] , where people see every issue as the end of the world. The club has been around for over 100 years, it has had thousands of players, many a hundred times better than Sterling ever will be. We'll move on.

Yes we will move on. But I think this line of reasoning doesn't really serve this particular situation very well. There isn't really a precedent for this. We've never had a kid this age do this to us, and sweeping it under the rug by referring to past glories is a comforting thought, but its just ignoring the problem. It suggests you feel we're too important or special for things to get worse than they currently are. we have to consider the future, not the past.    

&gt; It's people with views similar to yours that make the Sterling situation appear to be a lot worse than it is.

And it's people with views similar to yours which would apparently see our best players leave without raising a fuss at all? 

Come on dude don't make this personal. We're both entitled to our opinions and I'm merely discussing it, or at least i thought that's what this was... unfortunately you seem hell bent on focusing solely on anything you personally disagree with rather than trying to find any common ground, of which there could have been plenty. Neither of us wanted sterling to decide to jump ship, neither of us wanted to have this debate, both of us want the club to succeed, and both of us can draw a line in the sand here because neither of us gets to decide what happens next anyway. And once again - Do you have a figure you'd be happy with? Again bearing in mind the QPR clause...

The fact that he seemed very non-fussed by his verdict initially (I mean on his way to sentencing he had a nice trip down the Themes on a boat) and how there hasn't been much of an appeal as of yet. 

I don't know about you, but if I was being sentenced to a long time in prison for something I knew I didn't do, I would probably have to be dragged away kicking and screaming .

His victims were distraught, I followed the trial and he was another scumbag who used his fame to try and get away with it, he was another childhood TV star, was in favour with the Royals (he painted the queen) etc. , these only came out when the BBC was seen being ignorant to what Saville was up to and thus his fame was no longer a shield. 

If he is innocent then he has every right to appeal, bring in evidence that proves the prosecution evidence wrong, discredits a witness or anything, fact is his defense (I assume he used his wealth to get the best representation possible) wasn't enough to sway the jury.

Alot of peole are saying that his trial was unfair somehow, so why isn't there a move for a mistrial?

It's like forcing everyone to pay for a world class art gallery because ""you wouldn't go if we didn't make you, you'd go to something crass and low quality instead"".

The problem with this is that in order to operate a public service - broadcasting impartial and unbiased news, extensive and high-quality current affairs programming, varied and high-quality factual programming and documentaries, and free from advertising - requires a lot of money. And if you allowed people to opt-out - the people who are content with Sky News, TOWIE and IACGMOOH, and aren't interested in anything slightly informative or intellectually stimulating - the burden on those who are left to pay for it becomes to much. Unfortunately, there are a great deal people who are only interested in watching the sort of detritus that ITV and E4 pumps out, so it's economically viable for them to do so - unlike the service that the BBC provides.

There are many public services that I don't use, but my taxes still pay for. I don't use trains, but some of my taxes are spent on propping the rail industry up. I don't claim benefits, but some of my taxes are still spent on them. I can't remember the last time I used the NHS, but money from my taxes still goes to building new hospitals.

null,false,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,null,"&gt; The problem with this model is that it's expensive to implement

Is it? The BBC knows what licenses have been issued, it would be easy enough to have a ""BBC account"" and the ability to link four or five of them to a licence and thus to iPlayer content.

It's a problem others have already tackled with ease, namely Sky and Netflix - and Sky are probably the closest since they link accounts to viewing card numbers and thus Sky subscription. Replace ""viewing card number"" with licence number and ""Sky subscription"" with TV Licence and away we go

&gt; the BBC would arguably cease to be a ""public service"".

It's debatable if it ever was in the first place (when put into context with services that would result in the country literally crumbling if they were abolished)

&gt; The only reason that this is allowed is because the license fee has existed far longer than Internet video streaming has; if the BBC were being created today, you'd surely need a license in order to stream programmes. 

I am aware of this - but it's not terribly relevant. The BBC could still choose to limit access to streaming content.

&gt; . The number of people who use iPlayer for this purpose is going to continue to increase, so a way needs to be found to get those people to contribute.

Yes - this is what my idea would tackle, without the un-necessary burden of forcing everyone to pay.

&gt; And as I said, the number of people who don't consume any BBC content whatsoever, must absolutely tiny.

But still very easily possible

&gt;  It's cheap to ""administer"", doesn't require costly enforcement or a subscription model, and the contribution per person would be less than the current price of a TV license.

The BBC has already set the precedent that you can opt out of its services and the requirement to pay for them. Changing this would quite rightly result in uproar - especially at a time when taxes get frozen and unnecessary cuts made to real public services - people would wonder why the BBC's funding can be secured but their local x/y/z is closing.

It's debatable if the contribution would really change. Most households are TV licence holders, so the per person contribution from taxes is either going to be really low, or the BBC is going to get even more money to burn",null,0,null,1434316473,null,0,false,0,cs6i2vp,null,t3_39rutb,null,t1_cs6i2vp,null,t1_cs6h7z8,null,null,null,1436999942,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

If you can take a longer term view, there's a benefit to putting your money in an ISA wrapper (gains are tax free), but if you're taking a long term view you should probably be looking at stocks and shares rather than cash. On the 10, 20, 30 year timescales you're talking about, a decent chunk would ideally be in equities. Some low cost index funds in a stocks and shares ISA from an online broker would be a good start.

 the important thing is fit. If the fit is right and as bigflipper said, brand reputation you can't go wrong.

The helmet should fit snugly and may even feel a bit too tight until it is in place correctly. Be sure it sits squarely on your head. It shouldn't be tilted back on your head like a hat. Remember, if your helmet is too large, several things could happen: it will move around and up and down on your head when you least want it to; it can be noisy and let in wind; worst of all, it may come off in a crash!

Once the helmet is on your head, make a few other fit checks before fastening the straps.

The cheek pads should touch your cheeks without pressing uncomfortably.
There should be no gaps between your temples and the brow pads.
If the helmet has a neck roll, it shouldn't push the helmet away from the back of your neck.
On full-face helmets, press on the chin piece. The helmet or face shield should not touch your nose or chin. If it does, it will surely do so at speed from wind pressure.

With the helmet still on and the straps securely fastened, move it from side to side and up and down with your hands. If it fits right, your skin should move as the helmet is moved. You should feel as if a slight, even pressure is being exerted all over your head. Remember, too, that a helmet loosens up a bit as the comfort liner compresses through use. A new helmet should be as tight as you can comfortably wear it.

Now, with the chin strap still securely fastened and your head straight, try rolling the helmet forward off your head. You shouldn't be able to pull it off. If you can, the helmet is too big. Take off the helmet. Does your head feel sore anywhere? Are there any red spots on your forehead? Pressure points can be uncomfortable and can cause a headache after a long ride, so be sure your helmet isn't causing any. If it is, choose the next largest size or try a different brand of helmet. Human heads are not all the same shape, neither are helmets.

If you are still unsure about the helmet's fit, wear it around the store for a while to see if it remains comfortable. A helmet is an important investment, no matter what its price. Be sure the one you choose is right for you.

A nation is for its native citizens. Once you understand that, you'll see why Australia, Canada, and Switzerland have their controls.

And immigration comes in many forms, some of which aren't acceptable, such as illegal economic migrants coming from Africa to take advantage of the generous welfare here. We already have laws to stop them, but some still make it in.

And you can stop mentioning ukip for the 5th time, I didn't vote for them and i don't care about them, so I'm certainly not donating my money to them.

As someone who is active in teaching and research, I can tell you I know my fair share of skilled migrants. That doesn't make illegal economic immigration OK.

When you said ""Since the pound is worth more than the dollar, does that mean that standard things will cost less pounds than they would dollars"" - it made it seem like you didn't understand basic maths. Like I said, prices of things do vary compared to the US. Generally you will find things more expensive. Think of it like turning the dollar sign into the pound sign and you will get general prices. Some things here are actually cheaper though! Prices in the UK are generally the same across the country. 

Prices do vary depending on where you shop, so it does pay to go to several grocery stores and check prices. They change the prices every so often because they're always competing with each other. In the centre of Edinburgh all the supermarkets are 'express' versions - think the size of Trader Joes. Tesco and Sainsburys have a lot of shops around. There's some cheaper shops too such as Iceland, Aldi and but I don't think they have those near where you live. There is a farmfoods near the university though. It might be worth checking for branded products at cheaper prices than usual. 

Non tourist places - anything not directly on the royal mile or around princes street. I suggest checking Yelp because there's so many options and it would help narrow down what you're interested In. 
I also suggest searching around this sub reddit for pub/bars and food suggestions, there's a few threads that cover it better than I could I'm sure.

I was abused as a kid. Not sexually, but physically. Tell me, if my mother asked ""can i kick the shit out of you?"" and I said 'yes', would it be my fault for any injuries she caused? Of course not.  
Was it the right answer? Of course not.   
Was she going to respect my answer is it was 'no'? Of course not.  
Was 'no' the right answer? Of course it was.  
Would I blame myself if my answer was 'yes'? Of course not.  

So, if i wouldn't blame myself for giving the wrong answer to a question i shouldn't have been asked, which preceded abuse that was going to happen anyway, why would I then blame others for giving an equally wrong answer to a question they shouldn't have been asked which preceded abuse that was going to happen anyway?

It's a rhetorical question. Go fuck yourself.

null,false,VettelS,null,null,null,"&gt; Is it? The BBC knows what licenses have been issued, it would be easy enough to have a ""BBC account"" and the ability to link four or five of them to a licence and thus to iPlayer content.

&gt; It's a problem others have already tackled with ease, namely Sky and Netflix - and Sky are probably the closest since they link accounts to viewing card numbers and thus Sky subscription. Replace ""viewing card number"" with licence number and ""Sky subscription"" with TV Licence and away we go

Yes, a subscription model *could* be made to work and could be affordable to implement. But given the fact that almost everyone consumes some manner of the BBC's content anyway, funding through general taxation seems that it could be cheap*er* than a subscription model.

There's also the problem of misuse. People will try to share their license details with a friend to avoid paying twice, etc. Yes, there are ways to prevent this, but they frequently cause issues for innocent users as well. I'm not sure if you've used Sky's streaming service, but it's terrible in this regard - unreliable and inflexible. Yes, their implementation is poor and the BBC's needn't be, but all of these systems are intrinsic inflexible and prone to error.

But a subscription model has a more fundamental flaw that I've discussed in reply to someone else, here: http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/39rutb/jonathan_dimbleby_warns_of_powerful_vested/cs6hyvo.

&gt; The BBC has already set the precedent that you can opt out of its services and the requirement to pay for them. Changing this would quite rightly result in uproar - especially at a time when taxes get frozen and unnecessary cuts made to real public services - people would wonder why the BBC's funding can be secured but their local x/y/z is closing.

I'm not sure that it would cause uproar - you'd be relieving every household in the country of a £146 license fee.",null,0,null,1434317723,null,0,false,0,cs6iqy2,null,t3_39rutb,null,t1_cs6iqy2,null,t1_cs6i2vp,null,null,null,1437000431,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

But given the fact that almost everyone consumes some manner of the BBC's content anyway, funding through general taxation seems that it could be cheaper than a subscription model.

I don't why you are ranting about subscriptions. I am not suggesting the BBC goes subscription only, but that the BBC could adopt a Sky-like approach to locking down the iPlayer to its valid, paying users

&gt; There's also the problem of misuse. People will try to share their license details with a friend to avoid paying twice, etc. Yes, there are ways to prevent this, but they frequently cause issues for innocent users as well. 

That will always happen. The point is that it will cut down ""misuse"" (if ""misuse"" is really damaging the BBC - given that a very high percentage of eligible households have licences), if not eliminate it (which is not the expectation). 

&gt; I'm not sure if you've used Sky's streaming service, but it's terrible in this regard - unreliable and inflexible. 

Never really had a problem with it. Not that this is relevant here. The BBC doesn't have to have an identical system with identical restrictions - just that Sky's system is one example of dealing with internet viewing as an addon to an entrenched service

&gt; Yes, their implementation is poor and the BBC's needn't be, but all of these systems are intrinsic inflexible and prone to error.

I can't agree - and it's a pretty weak justification as to why ""everyone should pay""

&gt; I'm not sure that it would cause uproar - you'd be relieving every household in the country of a £146 license fee.

Yes, by giving them the burden of increased taxes or the lovely upsides of decreasing spending somewhere else to find £4bn+ for the Beeb, and without giving them the option to not pay at all, like they have now",null,0,null,1434318413,null,0,false,0,cs6j3xx,null,t3_39rutb,null,t1_cs6j3xx,null,t1_cs6iqy2,null,null,null,1437554167,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

My understanding is that they perform the tests on several iterations of the helmet, on store bought helmets to prevent ""gaming"" of the system (think it says this somewhere on the SHARP site).  

I have an IS-17 and an AGV K3 SV I much prefer the AGV for comfort and ventilation (the HJC has vents, but you can barely feel anything), the tradeoff is the impressive amount of wind noise that the AGV generates.  I'd still recommend it though, just get some cheap earplugs if you haven't got some already.  I think the HJC will probably be OK in winter, but it was starting to get too warm for me even in the fairly mild weather we've had so far!

And, as others have said, fit and comfort are super important.

Recently I had got one of mates back to riding. He is around 45, had been (illegally) riding 2 stroke 125cc's when he was a lad too. We managed to get him through CBT &amp; DAS in no trouble at all and now he's riding my old Bandit 600 and dreaming of his upgrade to an FJR1300. 

You are probably not rushing to it but make sure that you are well within your capabilities. Practice a lot, don't cut corners and don't take risks. 

Buying a YBR is a good idea, they are reliable and will get you back on the road. The problem is the old habits, riding alone on a YBR will not help you to get rid of them and might even make them settle down permanently. Getting rid of them and learning good habits is the important thing. That's what the DAS course is for. Make sure that you pay attention and have a good instructor. 

Don't forget that the power of a 600cc and the YBR is quite different, the weight and the handling is different too. Use the YBR to get used to the riding in the road sections but handling the bike, you have to learn that with the instructor and their bike.

My mate was passed through the CBT in about 2 hours. His DAS courses went smoothly, he managed to pass all the tests with minimal damage. He's still anxious. At the moment I'm at a business trip to US for three weeks and when I'm back in two week's time, we're planning for a good trip around. So my advice is to find some riding mates that are experienced enough, make sure that they observe and advice you all the time. Take the advice in, and have fun.

You will be fine. Good luck! ",null,0,null,1434319226,null,0,false,0,cs6jivc,null,t3_39snbu,null,t1_cs6jivc,null,t3_39snbu,null,null,null,1437001046,null,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2,null
