The nervous system on the wall?). Season 1 and 2 also had farting aliens and Love and Monsters. 

I think what you are maybe hitting on is that RTD's Who had a lot of ""heart"" and dramatic cheesy moments while Moffat's Who is *slick* and tries to feel more cerebral than dramatic. 

You might actually like a lot of Classic. The beginning of Tom Baker's era is really some of the best stuff the show has ever done if you can get used to the slower pacing. That period is a mix of corny special effects, great dialog, interesting sci fi and gothic horror with a dose of what I can only describe as ""charm"" that NuWho has never really managed to pull off. In fact, the writers ended up getting in a lot of trouble for making the show ""too dark"" as this parents organization threw a huge fit which lead to some of the staff changing and the introduction of K-9 to fit a lighter tone again. 

Anyway, if you watch one episode from Classic as a NuWho fan I recommend ""Genesis of the Daleks"" because it's super lore heavy, really shows what the Doc was like pre-time war, and is just a damn good story.

&gt;Your post makes the argument that there is no debate about ADHD and how to address it, even going as far to denigrate anybody who questions it, yet I've demonstrated that there is a huge difference of opinion on this topic from two well established authorities.

I said nothing of the sort.

&gt;Seriously, it's nigh on anti-vaccer levels of medical ignorance to dispute that some kids have this condition and require special assistance in order to manage properly at the same level as a neurotypical individual at their age.

That is the argument I made. Both of the experts you brought up acknowledge the existence of ADHD and recommend special treatment in response to it (albeit different treatments), so you haven't done anything to hurt my argument at all, on the contrary, thank you for the added validity to my argument by using expert opinions.

I'll stay out of any arguments regarding drugs, because I don't know enough about medicine to make a judgement as to what kind of treatment is best for ADHD symptoms. What I am saying is, ADHD is a legitimate condition, regardless of causes, that is not due to children being ""spoilt"" as one commenter put it, nor something that can be cured with ""a punch to the gob,"" as another so eloquently said. It's something that has to be taken seriously, not dismissed because things worked differently in the past. That's just what I wanted to get across, since it seems every time the topic of ADHD comes up, you get irritating people who don't believe that it's even a legitimate condition to begin with.

I love /r/unitedkingdom. Someone is talking about housing being too expensive and then wants to move to Canada to save money.

The average house price in Vancouver is higher than the average house price in London (go figure). 

Infact in most of Canada's biggest cities the houses are more expensive than the UK's. 

But that doesn't matter because this is /r/unitedkingdom, the home of facts don't matter unless they agree with our world view (tories bad, UK terrible, everywhere else amazing!)

Initially they came out in support of gay people's right to marry, then just last year 2 of their members voted against it. One of these being Judith Cochrane based in Ballyhackamore.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;The __Battle of Stamford Bridge__ took place at the village of [Stamford Bridge, East Riding of Yorkshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge,_East_Riding_of_Yorkshire) in England on 25 September 1066, between an English army under [King Harold Godwinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Godwinson) and an invading Norwegian force led by [King Harald Hardrada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_III_of_Norway) and the English king's brother [Tostig Godwinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tostig_Godwinson). After a bloody and horrific battle, both Hardrada and Tostig along with most of the Norwegians were killed. Although Harold Godwinson repelled the Norwegian invaders, his victory was short-lived: he was defeated and killed by the [Normans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normans) at [Hastings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hastings) less than three weeks later. The battle has traditionally been presented as symbolising the end of the [Viking Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Age), although major [Scandinavian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia) campaigns in Britain and Ireland occurred in the following decades, such as those of [King Sweyn Estrithson of Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweyn_II_of_Denmark) in 1069â70 and [King Magnus Barefoot of Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_III_of_Norway) in 1098 and 1102â03.

It's an advertising point because a Â£300 phone looks worse than a Â£300 phone with Â£50 cashback at a later date. Yes, it basically is you getting your own money back. With phones the cashback is sometimes in terms of credit on your bill, so it's not 'real' money, but it might still be the difference between you choosing one network over the other.

In addition to this, some people will buy the item on the premise of cashback because it looked like a better deal. They may then go on to forget to claim the cashback (especially if it's something like you need to do it 6 months later) or choose not to for whatever. There might be a lot of hoops to jump through, like sending in receipts, which might put people off. So in some cases the business won't even ever pay the cashback, despite it being used in promotions to sell the item in the first place, but still they make a sale.

The retailer or manufacturer can also gain information from a customer that they otherwise wouldn't get and can use for their own benefit.

As in what would a typical Liverpool goal look like? People seem to think it would be a smooth passing move but that is actually rare for us. Lately it seems to be simply moments of individual quality or nice play between the few players who have developed an understanding (Hendo and Coutinho yesterday). 

We certainly have a clear plan in building from the back, in pressing, but in the final third it really is hit and miss. In that way Suarez did make up for Rodgers or our squads lack of quality in chance creation. So many times you see Sterling going down the wing, and you just know there's no way we're going to score from here.

Similarly we rarely tip toe around the box with quick iinterchanges like Arsenal, though you'd think we have that ability with Coutinho, Lallana etc. 

We only really appear dangerous on the counter with space ahead of us. This is where I have an issue with our recruitment, we really don't seem to be targeting players who fit into a possession game. We're really a counter attacking side.

Arsenal have pretty much got top 4 for a decade by being able to easily beat those sides that just sit back and defend. They rarely won big games away from home, like us, but each game is worth 3 points so as long as you are consistent against the weaker teams you'll be up there.

Alba just bought 5% of Horse Hill for Â£240k yesterday. That's cheaper than the average UK house.

Reuters had this to say:

*The fact this story has received any attention says less about the prospect for oil production than the non-existent understanding of petroleum production among politicians, journalists and the public, and the country's neurosis about the potential for fracking across England's green and pleasant land.*

The CEO of Solo who have a stake in Horse Hill tries to set the record straight. No company has reported 10bnbbls OIP:

null,false,BenJoudarLFC,null,null,null,"&gt; Please don't throw whoscored scores and stats at me, I have very little time for people who believe that stats are the be all and end all of a players performance on the football pitch.

In your last post you literally just complained to me that I had no stats to back up my points. I also didn't just ""throw stats"" at you I used them, and other factors, to say why I prefer to have Lucas in our midfield than Allen in the 3-4-3 formation.

Not too happy about your point with Lucas' lack of mobility leading him to be a good DM. I think it's more impressive that he is a good DM considering his lack of mobility. You talk about Allen being tactically astute, I feel being able to read the opponents play is one of Lucas' strong points and statistically he uses this to his advantage very well. 3 at the back has 1 less defender in the side especially when we have Markovic and Moreno/Sterling on the wings. All players attack well and you usually see 2 of our CBs on the wings defending meaning Lucas (at times) has to cover with 1 CB.  

Allen is very versatile to be fair and he probably is the only midfielder that can play all 3 roles fairly well in the midfield 3 (Gerrard would be able to if he had the legs). Also, you have helped me see the value in Allen. I don't think he should be near the first 11 that much but seeing he has 13 starts in 31 games sounds about right now. 

Side note. When the 3 in midfield are set up, we do not have a NO.10 when we attack the player moving furthest forward may occupy space behind the striker or overtaking the striker, a lot of our attack is based off of midfield movement and supporting the loan striker. But even though they are in the same space doesn't mean a they are playing a NO.10 role. IMO

Great mpg and the only things that have cause any issues for me ( owned 18 months) on an 18 year old bike which I wouldn't consider standard maintanance is the sprocket carrier (Â£30) and one of the exhaust gaskets that has gone this week (Â£30 but that includes a whole new set of gaskets for both exhaust into heads and the gasket that blew and a new full set of studs).

For whatever reason Lambert, Balotelli and Borini  might as well not be at the club as Rodgers hasnât got any value out of them this season. His fault or not. That is around Â£25-30m we could have used better. Markovic and Lallana too have been peripheral.

A quick, clinical goalscorer to replace Suarez would have finished a lot of the chances we create. I think the club were expecting Sanchez and then panicked when he backed out. Iâm not sure he would have completely filled the Suarez hole, he wouldnât have hurt. Remy could have been useful. We do at times control possession well (think of the first Arsenal game), we need a finisher and dedicated central midfield presence, someone to sit next to Henderson and alternate with him in the centre, if we currently want to do much other than come fifth.

Curry Queen on Mill Rd, though they're slow as fuck due to popularity. 

Yim Wah on the catholic church corner. 

The Castle is pretty good for pub food - the one by the Council, not the one near the Regal.  

For new places to try, I can recommend The Grain Store. Went there last weekend and got a huge, delicious hunters chicken on the bone with chips and coleslaw for a tenner. 

Hmm. Where else? Well I really like GBK. 

Erm...I'd say avoid the tourist trap places - The Eagle/The Anchor are both kind of meh. 

Pint Shop does alright scotch eggs. 

The italian place opposite is good value for open sandwich bread things, the Sicilian one which always has queues out the door, can't remember the name.
 


That's all I can think of for now. Chop House is good for steak, as is the Riverbar Steak House. The latter does really good chateaubriand. 


For further afield eats, try both the Red Lion and the Green Man in Grantchester, the Shelford Deli, The Navigator in Little Shelford for Thai, The Wrestlers is also good I hear.

**Price of product:** Â£10.50 for 75ml/2.5 US Fl. Oz.

**Where did you purchase:** Boots

**Product claims:** *""Visibly younger. This super hydrating, easily absorbed, protecting and renewing formula has been created to target the signs of ageing and help your hands have a more youthful future. It intensively conditions with day long moisturisation for softer and smoother skin and works to reveal younger looking hands in 4 weeks. Fine lines are visibly reduced, skin feels more supple with improved elasticity and looks more even.""*

**About you:** Easily tanned hands, dried out by excessive paper handling due to work.

**Your opinion:** I'm not keen on the fragrance at all, it's very perfumey to me and definitely lingers but it's probably the best SPF hand cream I've tried texture-wise so far. It's not greasy once given a few minutes to absorb and leaves me with a slightly powdery finish, moisturisation is pretty good too, better than the Neutrogena offerings but still lacking the oomph the non-SPF counterparts offer.

Only downside would be the actual SPF, it's only 15, but it does have a 5 Star Boots rating. What does that mean? It means that the equivalent amoun of UVA rays it blocks is at least 90% of the UVB rating, so it roughly translates to something like UVA-PF 13 or PA+++ so regular use should help prevent your hands from ageing but you might still get sunburnt.

null,false,Theskian,null,null,null,"Was thinking the other day of most likely people we'd have a chance of getting. My initial list was Austin/ings/Benteke, but I was thnking some more today.

As I've said the last 2 seasons, I think nows the time we need a 20 goal a season striker, JRod could fill that role, assuming he stays, but he'll still need a decent back up, which I think Pelle could do too, but we'll see.

**Austin** - Bit of a no brainer, as many have said, his form has been great, his goal against us was amazing, and I think he would slot nicely into our side, my only worry is, I think if a ""bigger"" team comes sniffing, he doesn't appear to be the kind of guy who will choose us over them, even if choosing us gaurantees playing time and a likely England call up.

**Ings** - Like Austin, has been fairly decent, but not quite as good, but was injured at the start of the season, and doesn't have the best service like Austin, I feel they are both similar players in that respect, I think we'd be more likely to get Ings, if we pursued him, but I don't feel like there are enough ""rumours"" circulating, which you'd expect there to be if there was even a sniff.

**Benteke** - Not to sure on him, I think he'd be hot, cold, or injured, he can be magic and a complete beast, if he stays in form, but I think that could mostly be down to injuries/the team he plays in, I think he could fit qutie well with us, and I think he can do a lot better then Villa.

**Hernandez** - While I think it would be a good signing, I'm not sure if he'd have the incentive, he just feels lazy, if he didn't do it at United, I'm not overly confident he'd come here with great joy and produce, not to mention, he thinkss himself above us, and would demand a big cheque.

**Borini** - One who is rarely mentioned, but I feel given the right team, he can be a very good striker, he was fairly good at Sunderland, with their constant relegation scrap team, so I think he'd be pretty good here, and even at Liverpool if he was given the chance, I think he just needs someone to give him a chance.

**Vokes** - Partner to Ings, and still not a terrible striker, This is the one I'm least convinced on, he has been in jured half the season, but I think he does have the capacity to produce, but I don't think he's that 20 goal a season striker we need.

**Remy** - Just one I joked about in the Chelsea linked with Schneiderlin/Clyne thread, Don't see this one, don't think I want it either, he thinks himself better then anything not top 4, would be pricey, and is doing the job Chelsea bought him to do, so I don't even think that would be a possibility unless they bring in a replacement for Remy.

**Green** - I'm gonna throw it here in this, despite not being a Striker, he's still a forward and I want him. Julian Green. Right Winger for Munich at the moment, 19 years old, American/German descent, but chose America to play for. Think we could develop him into something amazing.

As for the rest you mentioned, I don't think any of the ones left would come to us, or if we'd even want them. Jovetic will go elsewhere, Ballotelli lol no, Falcao definitely not, too pricey, Adebayor lol no again, Lukaku will go elsewhere, Van Persie is dated and pricey.

Check out the sunscreen mega reviews, also the Sun Protection Wiki article - both linked to in the sidebar. Boots own brand products and some sold in their stores should have a star rating for UVA protection: that is a percentage of the UVB protection. You can also look up the suncreen filters to find out if they protect against UVA - lists are linked to in the mega review thread.

Where you are using international products you can Google for the US version and see if that has the same formulation and if it has a UVA rating (US use a different system tho).

All products undergo the same test for SPF, that includes a standardised density of applications - this means you can accurately compare one product to another. I have posted links to my blog series on sunscreen if you want to learn more about the recommendations and the science side, just scroll down the main page of SCA UK.

There are several of us here who think the Simple Kind to Skin+ Moisture Cream SPF 30 is a decent buy. It was recently on multibuy offers at both Tesco and Boots, so worked out under Â£4 for 50ml. Simple is pretty much permanently on offer somewhere so also check Superdrug, Wilko, Asda, Sainsbury.

I worry Ings is too much like Long and Jay Rod, and Koeman's system asks a lot out of strikers in the context of hold up play. Ings would be my vote if we were to play two pure strikers up top, but I worry he could end up a bit isolated all by himself the way Koeman likes to play.

null,false,seemylolface,lfc12,,null,"I want the diamond back.  Flooding the attack with bodies lets us play that sharp, short, quick, incisive passing we like so much.  I think the midfield we played the diamond with last season is what hurt us so much defensively too, we were relying on Gerrard to defend a lot, with Henderson and Coutinho beside him.  Hendo and Coutinho ran their asses off, but it was just a little too much to cover, especially for a player like Coutinho who's natural instincts don't tend towards defensive responsibilities.  Let's try a more stable 3 at the base of the diamond: Lucas holding with Can and Hendo to either side.  That midfield is a defensive beast, but Can and Hendo have the engines to get all about the pitch.  Can's got more attacking prowess in his game than he's been able to show from CB so far too.  Put these 3 behind Coutinho, give him freedom to roam and cause havoc, with Sterling and Sturridge in front of him.  Sterling and Sturridge together has all the pace and intelligence to pull defenses apart with their movement, and Sterling could/should eventually develop a bit more of a killer instinct in front of goal.  If we sign a beast of a striker or Origi hits the ground running then it can be Can at the base with Coutinho and Hendo to either side, Sterling at the tip, and Sturridge/Origi paired up top.

Defensively I think if we're going back to a 4 back formation then we need a new center back to pair with Sakho.  It just comes down to our tactics when we play 4 at the back.  I like Martin Skrtel a lot, he's been a tremendous servant to the club and he's been absolutely immense at times when we've really needed him, but with the way we like to set up when playing 4 at the back, we really expose his weaknesses.  He's not a very spacially aware player and struggles to keep track of players running around him, which is basically suicide in a back 4 that likes to push the fullbacks up the pitch and spread the CBs when in possession. There's just too much space for him to keep track of, he can't do it.  If we were defending deeper and a bit more compact in transitions it would suit him way better, but we can't do that without giving up some of the offensive potential that comes from our tactics.

2.  Look at the relationship between interest rates and mortgage payments: at low, low interest rates, people can afford to take on big mortgages.  

3. Walk through London and look around you: count the cranes.  There is a crazy building boom.  How many houses would need to be built to make a real difference to prices or rents?  

4.  The UK has very strict planning regulations, and a long history of policies and regulations that have tended to support house prices. Look at the fraction of people who are owner-occupiers in the UK versus other European countries, and consider why these regulations and policies have been politically popular.

Just tonight I was riding home after some laps of regents park (trying to get my BMI back to healthy after winter!) an M&amp;S lorry, at about 20:15 to 20:30, on the A1, northbound.  By my spedo I was doing 26, so I can appreciate his desire to pass me in the thirty, however, his relative speed was far more than 10mph.  He also was close enough that he buffeted me with enough force for me to wobble, I nearly ended up having an oscillatory response (think tank slapper).  Complete cunt, because what would you know, not even 30 seconds later he is in queueing traffic, he clearly wasn't thinking ahead.

This is the problem for many cyclists, just as much as many drivers remember the idiots who jump lights, make others take action to avoid hitting them, cyclists remember things like that M&amp;S HGV tonight, it shapes their views.

The fact is, if he had been an inch at most closer, I'd have been hurt, he wouldn't have been at all.  I also frequently drive in London, I own two cars, I'm pass plus and full member of the IAM (Advanced Driving).  So I appreciate what it's like.  But the issue is some drivers don't acknowledge that there might be a very valid reason why I'm riding 3 feet from the curb, and they decide to try and show their displeasure by forcing me closer.  This is completely un-acceptable, *The trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt.*

BTL, if we had enough supply of housing (ie, we built enough, or had population control) would only benefit us.  Owning a house is often not practical, sometimes people want to live in a place only a short time, owning and selling is expensive, it's far, far more expensive to move as a homeowner, than as a tenant.  So having a good supply of rental properties can just be a good thing, see Germany.

The problem is we've had population growth, in some places (such as London) rapid population growth unlike any other for a generation.  Meanwhile, we've not increased the supply for meet the demand.

BTL isn't a problem at all.  It's akin to blaming the pub for profiteering, when they are restricted on how many pints they can sell.

&gt;  I don't agree with eg CJ381 which believes women shouldnt go to prison unless it is a serious crime. And PD205 which wishes to pursue complete nuclear disarmanent

This is what I am talking about, it is irrelevant that you disagree or agree, because they are never going to get enough power to say ""this is what is going to happen"", what is going to happen is that the major parties are going to present policies then the greens are going to have to option to vote yes or no. Are they going to get the option to vote for nuclear disarmament, nope, neither the prison thing. They might get the option to raise or at least not lower the science budget, they might get the option to vote on energy infrastructure, but not make policy about it, they might get the option to vote on transport infrastructure and even create some policy in their demographics there as well, they also might get the option to vote to lower (but not remove) tuition fees. 

This is the thing, these crazy extreme views, they are pretty irrelevant as they have so little power that they can't be crazy, they can only vote in a left wing manner on the issues that are brought up. This is why I say their words are irrelevant, if the conservatives and Labour are pro-nuclear the greens are irrelevant, they could get twice the MP's they are predicted and they would still get nothing done on the nuclear issue.

The issue is, on the policies that come up how are they going to vote? That is why you have to agree with their ideology not there words, because that is all they can push.

That is why you would have to be an idiot to vote on their policies, because they are going to be as used as my policies or the drunks down the pub, the ideology is what matters. 

Maybe in 4 years time, or 8 years time, the greens have 10-20% of the vote and actually have to have serious policies, that will work, because they might have significant influence, but until then it doesn't matter.

Now that all sounds a bit harsh, so let me explain:

/u/Balf is a guy that recently asked to be verified via the /r/ukcigars subreddit.  One of the members stepped up to the plate and volunteered to do it but due to the new rules on verification's was ineligible.  So I thought, whats the harm, how bad can it be.  

In Pm's while working out the trade I tell the guy, send whatever you would like to send, you only get 1 verification so do what you want to do with it.  So he names the sticks he was going to send, a Tatuaje Tattoo, a Asylum 13 robusto and an Alec Bradley Black Market Torpedo.  He then says ""oh the box is full""

How is the box full with 3 cigars I hear you ask, because the son of a mother isn't just shipping 3 cigars is he!

Firstly, his [Duct-Taping skills are amazing!](http://i.imgur.com/e3XyIUB.jpg)

And so are his packing skills as well [because he fit all this in a fairly small box too...](http://i.imgur.com/QrPkPgD.jpg)

The 3 sticks he mentioned, above - The Tattoo I have wanted to try for a while, I have liked everything I have smoked by Asylum so I'm looking forward to that and the BM I like in the robusto so the torpedo looks good!

The other 3:

Montecristo Number 2 from September 14: I was really wanting one of these yesterday to the point that I was trying to fit some in the budget so thank you so much for this!

Montecristo Open Regata: I had one of these recently sent in another persons verification trade (/u/serpuissance) and I think they are great smokes 

Tatuaje Black Label Corona Gorda: Now I know there has been some stalking (not much I talk about them all the time) because he sent me my favorite stick of all time.  It does mean that I cant send him one in return so ill have to go a little bigger...

On top of that there is some Tomintoul (a single malt Speyside Scotch) whisky thats 16 years old and is described as his ""favorite tipple"" at the moment, some BarBar Belgian Honey beer - I was talking about this with him recently after what I am calling [Cooler-gate](http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/30b5hg/all_hyperbole_aside_i_was_hit_by_not_just_a_bomb/) so I am excited as all fuck to tuck into it.  Keeping up the flavored beer theme he also sent some Cherry laced Belgian Beer which I am going to have to keep away from my other half.

Great trade man, thanks a lot for what you sent I will enjoy every part of it (as long as I hide that cherry beer from Flick)

So how does this all come back to starting something that you shouldn't?  Because I was expecting a 3 stick trade, not this.  Its going to be like picking on that nerdy science guy and giving him a slap before you read ""Bruce Banner"" on his name tag.

Everyone wants to live in the South East therefore there isn't enough housing in the south east and especially London so because of supply and demand house prices have rocketed.

Meanwhile in much of the rest of the UK housing is perfectly affordable and there's plenty available.

Then there's expectations and the fact a lot of young people don't have realistic ones. Whereas my generation bought whatever you could afford to get on the ladder understanding it probably wasn't going to be in the first choice of area you wanted to be in and you expected you were going to have to do a bit of work on it, current young people seem to only want to buy a show house that doesn't even need carpets in the best areas in the country which, quelle surprise, command high prices.

Almost without fail every time someone has mentioned somewhere that is unaffordable I've been able to find affordable housing. The excuses of ""well its 1/2 mile from the railway station"" or ""but it needs redecorating"" and pretty much every excuse under the sun comes out.

Most parents to disabled children want to care for them at home, in the family unit and until either the parent or child dies.

The only person I have personally known to die in a car accident succumbed to the injuries he suffered after hitting his head on the A-pillar after he crashed into a telegraph pole (freak accident in both leaving the road and striking his head). In fact head injuries among motorists is not uncommon.

Now, how often do you see campaigns for drivers to wear helmets to save themselves from injury? It isn't an uncommon injury, I believe.  Pedestrians also suffer head injuries quite often. And so it makes sense for them to be encouraged to wear helmets when out and about too. Why isn't there a massive movement to bring this about?

Sounds ridiculous, of course. But wearing one on a push-bike is just 'common-sense'...

null,false,widgetas,null,null,null,"&gt; This isn't terribly different

There is a fundamental difference: vulnerability. In addition the group that blame the cyclist seem to be more vocal and/or are larger in number, but also have their view bolstered by the narrative in the media, police and the courts. How often do you see a story about a dead/injured cyclist and it's mentioned as to whether or not they were wearing a helmet? It might seem a small point but it's indicative of the attitude, or at least the constantly reported attitude.

A good deal of effort in increasing cyclist safety appears to be centred around getting cyclists to wear high-viz, cycle helmets etc. without much effort put into motorist education or holding bad drivers to account. There are cases seemingly every few weeks where a driver is either found not-guilty or barely given a ticking off for killing a cyclist, and in many cases the cyclist was entirely visible and not doing anything wrong. I could link any number of examples, but here are two from the last week or so: [Here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-31989287) (note: only reported by the driver that the cyclist was at fault) and [here](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/dead-cyclists-family-win-review-over-driver-who-killed-dad-on-regent-street-10105903.html) (though may yet result in criminal charges). I purposefully linked to two ""non-biased"" sources there, but if you read up on either case - particularly the 18 year old - you'll get a clearer idea as to how expendable cyclists appear to be.

The problem is that it's seen as a ""moral"" issue that only rich people can get away with tax dodging like this (and like [giving your 10 year old daughter shares in your company](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31w5vu/hi_im_jeremy_vine_the_bbcs_election_analyst/cq5igi5)), not the rest of us. 

If the taxman even suspects that a plumber puts the odd Â£20 in his pocket, they can reassess his earnings and tax him on whatever arbitrary amount they believe he might be capable of earning. They don't have to prove it, and I don't believe you can challenge it (or not realistically, anyway).

But close the non-dom loophole, and these guys will probably all set up companies in Antigua, and have themselves paid by this 3rd party, so they'll just be doing the same thing by a different avenue.

To me it's just lack of supply and high demand.  That's it.  Having lots of BTL landlords will drive rents down.  Hene the very low yields we see in London.  What will be interesting is how a decrease in prices will impact this, the trend changing could result in a heavy crash, even prices halving, wouldn't result in a good yield in many areas, if you consider a good yield to be 7% and include ground rent.

Having more landlords means lower rents, as you've increased the supply.  The problem is, when the assets are rising every year.  I doubt I could afford to rent my place, only because I bought it a decade back, can I afford to live alone, so I really do sympathise and think the situation is dangerously out of control.

So the issues with BTL is you can create a 'rent trap', where there are no houses to buy, only rent.  But that's a bit off an odd view.  I've got 120sqm to myself.  I used to have a flat mate, but I'm a cunt and difficult to live with, so the last 5 years I've lived alone, *mostly*.  As such I'm underutilising this space.  My mortgage is less than the rent would be, but I'm not going anywhere.  This respect, BTL is not any different to owner occupier, we are reducing the supply of buyable properties.

The solution isn't to attack BTL, but to increase supply.  A supply that reacts accordingly to demand is the best solution to speculative holders, and allowing people to be able to buy the home they want.

VAT is an absolute mess. We have three rates of VAT in this country (0%, 5% and 20%). Then you have the products that are exempt from VAT but have separate taxes on the sale of these goods that basically function the same as VAT to the consumer. 

An example would be insurance, which is VAT exempt but has a sales tax called IPT, charged at 6% (except travel insurance, of course, which has a special IPT rate of 20%).

So we have at least four sales tax rates: 0%, 5%, 6%, 20%, applied, as the article alludes to, in a way that makes not much sense to anyone.

Honestly, I try not to think about it most the time. It makes me very despondent about my future. 

The only things I have in the back of my head that gives me hope about the housing situation is that in 5 years time most of the population are going to be renting... and we aren't talking 21 year olds fresh outta' uni... oh no, we're talking 35-40 year olds with kids... living at the whims of their landlords. It's going to make the issue hugely political on a generational level - perhaps in the same way conscription made the Vietnam war a huge generational issue in the USA back in the 70s. 

I'm pretty convinced that whoever wins the 2020 election will probably do it on their housing and rental reform manifesto. Renting needs to become much more like owning, with draconian limits on what landlords can actually demand of tenants (all be it with greater financial protection for landlords to recoup money when tenants fail to pay or damage properties). There then needs to be a drastic move to constrain price growth in the housing market. 

Essentially;

* Renting needs to be much cheaper than buying (in terms of monthly payments), secure and flexible. This is the real trick... it's going to be very hard for any government coming in to suddenly magic a million homes into existence... but if they make renting more like owning in terms of what you can do then it won't be such a big issue for voters. 

* Buying needs to be more accessible to those who want to. It strikes me as absurd that as a 28 year old guy with a brilliant job and high income that I'm a higher risk than a 58 year old BTL wannabe simply because he can stump up a Â£15K deposit and I can't... even though I have 30 years more working life left in me than he does. The problem is the bank would rather lend money to him and have me pay him (so essentially the bank still get my money, all be it through the landlord) because the landlord has assets to act as collateral if it all goes tits up. Part of improving this situation might be to legislate to restrict the conditions banks can lend to prospective BTL landlords. i.e. maybe they have to be able to put down a minimum 30% deposit or something. That would instantly cut most of the current BTL'ers out.

I'm convinced that by 2020 the issue will be hugely political. The thing is, renting when you are 25-30 is annoying. Renting when you are 30-40 with kids is awful... imagine a landlord being able to evict you with 4 weeks notice and trying to desperately find somewhere new to live, with limited money (because you've been paying all your earnings to the C**T who just evicted you) - and moving could mean your kids changing schools/losing friends etc. 

I think the trick is probably going to be to attack the problem from every angle;

* Make renting more like owning - heavily regulate the market to control prices, prevent landlords dictating tenants lifestyle, introduce a german style ""tenure"" system where tenants are basically safe from eviction as long as they want a property and don't destroy it.

* Build more houses (the obvious one) 

* Restrict the expansion of BTL. Force the rental sector to professionalize into companies rather than BTL. ",null,0,null,1428618614,null,0,false,0,cq72o6e,null,t3_31zmc8,null,t1_cq72o6e,null,t1_cq6pm5y,null,null,null,1432298151,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

The very word land**lord** itself harks back to a time when tenants were illiterate peasant scum who were nothing and property owners were landed gentry who mattered in the eyes of the law. Our system of renting is based on an archaic class based system that has just clumsily fallen into 21st century use simply because no politician has gone to the trouble of really modernizing it. 

In Germany the word for someone who rents is *""Mieter""*. It means one who hires, and the word for renting *""Verleih""* means to lend. it speaks to a cultural difference between the UK and Europe. In the UK property is a status symbol. Those who have it are important, those who don't were considered scum (traditionally speaking). In Europe renting is a transaction between two mutual parties, each with their own responsibilities who are equals in the eyes of the law.

It staggers me that as a tenant it can take 6-12 months to try to force a landlord to make repairs to a property which is actually endangering your life... but the landlord can use a special online portal to obtain a rapid section 21 eviction order against you within 4 weeks if you fail to pay rent... it goes to show where the legal systems priorities lie.

Some of these factories sell the products they are making for the brands, without paying the brand name premium. They are basically running a black market business. Thats what Aliexpress mostly is, direct to consumer from factories.



If you search the actual brand name you'll run into knock offs, if you really were as used to the site or actually bought off it regularly you'd be able to find the cheat to buying authentic outsourced products. They are never listed under the correct name i.e ""Xxxx team jersey"" will never show the authentic ones, thats just common sense. Thats why its $14


These products are never listed under their true name. Even in the picture the brand name will be blurred but it comes 100% packaged and made like the branded product even the documentation. Its quite easy to spot fakes if you have half a brain as well as real one. You can even go to a dealership and confirm it. They basically will not list it as the branded product to hide it yet its easy to find if you know the dealers.


Whats your buyers rating on Alibaba and express? You sound like you are just talking cliches and don't actually use it much to know these inner circle deals.



It has all the knock offs and the authentic stuff you need if you know what to look for. If you end up buying fakes then blame yourself for not investigating properly. For most products though knock offs are more than good enough unless its important anyway.",null,0,null,1428620175,null,0,1428620546,0,cq73lgy,null,t3_31xtjg,null,t1_cq73lgy,null,t1_cq6f9pb,null,null,null,1432298587,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

An obvious attempt to claw for support from a demographic currently under-represented among their voter base? Certainly. And I imagine it wont really pay off. It is a policy that will have *a negligible* impact on the poorest women in the country (approximately Â£7 per year by my estimates), and will be viewed as patronising by most, given that UKIP don't campaign with a broader agenda of feminism (indeed, they have a history of rather embarrassing remarks regarding women) but are instead primarily focused on reduced immigration and EU withdrawal. 

Women who agree with UKIP's immigration policies will vote UKIP. Women who don't won't vote UKIP. Removing VAT on tampons will sway nobody, and may even be damaging to their image by portraying them as being out of touch with issues that actually are concerns for women.

*Edit: the VAT rate on tampons is actually 5%, and not the 20% I originally assumed. A pack of tampons costs [approximately Â£3](http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/browse/default.aspx?N=4294792363). 12 packs per year incurs a cost of Â£36, 5% of which is Â£1.80.

Regardless of speculators it is impossible for housing to continue if people cannot afford property. 95% of the demand is people wanting houses. If that falls then the speculators cannot make up the gap. So the most prices can get to is the absolute maximum debt that can be serviced by the public. After that demand will fall and foreign investment or not prices will fall with it.

Every measure taken so far has been to extent the absolute maximum amount of debt that can be serviced. With artificially low interest rates and special state subsidies of deposits for first time buyers. There remains a limit even with these changes.

I doubt there will be a sensible solution. There'll be 30 years of pricing chaos before the last person who sees housing as an unquestionably good investment ends up buried.

The most obvious and direct reasons were the introduction of ""Right to Buy"" for council tenants, a system that was quickly and effectively gamed by property speculators, and increasing centralised control of local council budgets, reducing their ability to spend on new council houses.

Indirectly, the large scale privatisation programmes had a significant impact. Prior to privatisation, *all* of the infrastructure necessary to support housing (water, electricity, gas, phones, public transport) was owned by the state. If a council wanted to build new homes they co-ordinated with what was essentially another government department to get everything done in the right order. Since this was the *only* way to get necessary infrastructure in place, well established practices were present on both sides.

Council housing is still subject to our restrictive planning laws, so councils would still find it hard to build what people want where they want, and would also suffer from the problem that it would be specified and planned by people with no stake in the outcome and less incentive to do a good job.

The reason for the lack of cheap (not affordable - cheap) housing is that there's a lack of housing. It's simple supply and demand. Demand is high, supply is low, therefore prices are high.

Because it has had  declining or stagnating population for much of its recent past so it might help justify why UK house prices are high because its population is growing? Why even compare with the EU when much of it has very different attitudes towards property tenure?

2) If low interest rates are helping mortgages, why is it that that we still have the problems with housing? Why aren't all the people stuck renting now able to buy a house given mortgage rates have now been at record lows for a number of years. What about the effect low interest rates are having on people who are trying to save up for a deposit but now have to wait longer and are put off from from saving?

What we have seen this year so far is an increase in buy-to-let mortgages (up 12% in a year). While first-time and homemoving mortgages are down 14% and 17% respectively  in the year up to January. The only increase in mortgages has been in landlords buying property in the last year.


3) Much of the building boom in London is (luxury) housing. 

4) I don't understand your point. How do planning regulations encourage ownership, which is what you seem to be suggesting? Is it not more that ownership more likely generates stronger NIMBYism manifesting itself in planning decisions?

5) I look at population density and find for example that London is less dense than many other big cities in Europe like Paris and Milan.

No one is claiming FSG is perfect and I don't like some of what they've done either, but blaming them for not spending enough on the club is a bit silly whilst simultaneously complaining about ticket prices and not wanting to spend your own money.  Why should the 'small time charlies', as the author puts it, be expected to supplement the incomes of the supporters at their own detriment?  If the investors in FSG were raking in the cash out of the club's coffers and using it to buy their 4th yacht, then fair enough, but that's hardly been the case has it?

It's stressful and demanding, and on occasion it just becomes too much, but it's more a feat of stamina than fortitude.

General Practice conversely is a mix between extraordinary tedium (MY HANG NAIL IS BACK AGAIN) and watching people you have time to develop a rapport with sicken and die. It was the most profoundly depressing experience I've ever had.

**Hernandez** - Even if we got him for a reasonable price on reasonable wages (which I doubt) he's so desperate for playing time he might kick up a fuss if he isn't first name on the sheet every week. Good striker but I'm just not sure he's the right fit for us

**Ings** - He seems decent, but he's pretty similar (but maybe better) to Shane Long and ManÃ© who we already have. Maybe if Long went the other way? Otherwise I feel like we'd be adding an extra man but without adding any extra options.

**RVP** - Injuries abound. Can't see him playing even half a schedule anywhere from this point on. Expensive too

**Jovetic** - Maybe, he seems like a more 10/9 type striker which could work really well with Pelle. But really I want us to get an *alternative* to Pelle, someone who can lead the line when Pelle needs a rest.

**Balotelli** - For the right price I'd have him, but I've always had a bit of a soft spot for him anyway for some reason. Seems like a player that needs to be loved to get the best out of him and this is a nice and friendly club so it could work. Realistically though I think he might be a bit of trouble and if he has one good season would leave again anyway. Another one with the wages issue too.

**Adebayor** - Fuck no.

**Lukaku** - I don't rate him so no. I'd prefer Benteke if it was a choice between the two of them.

**Benteke** - Had an excellent season his first year with Villa then was hot and cold. This was at a pretty poor side though. One to keep an eye on to see how he ends the season. Chances are he'd already be at a bigger club if it wasn't for a bad injury though, so he might not stay with us for long if he did well.

The magic number of seats is 360.

So, with Labour at 277 + Lib (+28) = 305. Hrm. Add in SNP (+55) = 360. AHA!! 

However, thats scraping the barrel. Its not a clear majority. They would need the support of possibly Green for the +1. Also, the SNP have stated that they dont really want to go into coalition with ed, they would be happier with a confidence and supply agreement, which means I believe that the SNP's seats dont get counted. 

What a mess. 

With the SNP refusing to deal, it becomes impossible to form a majority government, unless the Tories and Labour work together in a Grand Coalition. 

To be honest, these are roughly the figures that I personally believe are more realistic. If it does go this way, then we may not have a stable government for a very long time.

Yes, I have worked for Yodel, DHL, ANC, Interlink, City Link, and DPD. 

Want to know the fastest way to get your parcel?

Heres the secret. Not many people are told this, but you can actually arrange to have it dropped at a neighbours house. These days, you can even put a note on the parcel as to which house it should go to if you are not there (something like ""Please leave at no. 77 if not in""). Alternatively, if the parcel isnt high value, you can sometimes organise a dead drop point like a shed/garage/enclosed porch area.

And heres something else. Ask your boss beforehand, but its sometimes possible to have the parcel diverted to your work place, which almost guarantees delivery. 

If this fails, STOP THE PARCEL. This means ringing the depot asap and preventing it from being put back on the van the following day. Ring the actual depot (NOT the call centre......) before you go there to make sure the parcel is in fact there and did not find its way back into the drivers loading cage. 

Now, all of the above makes one presumption - that its being delivered by a Van Driver from a ""local"" (BWAHAHA!!!!) depot.

In the case of Yodel or Hermes, this might not be the case. Both companies also employ ""Home couriers"".  If a home courier has the parcel you might be in more luck as the courier is likely to live within a mile of you, and can normally take 5 minutes out to come to you at a later hour of the day after you get back from work. Some of my Home Couriers took 2nd or 3rd attempts out as late as 10PM. 

Hermes IS a home courier, as that is all they employ. However, yodel uses a combination of both depot drivers and home couriers. If its Yodel, look at the phone number. If its a mobile number, and the depot number is crossed out, its a home courier. Some of them have their own personal cards with their contact details printed on them as well. However, some of the home couriers are lazy and get the customer to call the depot anyway, which is stupid, and as a supervisor, I would tell them off for doing this. The depot has no idea of the parcels actual location in all reality if it is with a home courier.

&gt;direct to consumer from factories

Not legitimate, not authentic. Why? Because the money you pay does not go into supporting your football team. 

Aside from that, the material they use are exactly what real licensed products use, but that's not the issue. The products sold on Alibaba use the same materials and fabric as those that are produced in Thailand but like you said are produced in China. This is also why the non-authentic products sold in China still have ""Made in Thailand"" on their tags. The problem is, Chinese factories do not have the authentic and licensed machine to produce them, Thailand factories do. 

Items were once sneaked directly out of Thailand factories to sell for the $15 price. That was 5-10 years ago. The Chinese government has set extremely strict laws since then to outcompete products made in other countries when they can produce the same unlicensed merchandise for themselves. Your 'direct to consumer from factories' products are long gone. It is almost impossible to sneak thousands of products each day from Nike and Adidas factories in Thailand nowadays. Thai workers are not willing to take the risk of losing their jobs by sneaking one or two a day out to sell for 1/10 of the $15 price. Licensed factories are heavily monitored and regulated now. Those that you buy from Alibaba for ~$15 today, are actually made in Chinese factories and are trying to imitate your 'direct to consumer from factories' products for their own Chinese citizens. Chinese people, from buying decades of knock-off, we can tell the difference even when they use the same material. Again, the adidas and nike tags are exactly the same. But when you try to line up, say, Germany jersey's slanted lines to what you see on Adidas websites, they are almost ALWAYS off.  

&gt;Its quite easy to spot fakes if you have half a brain as well as real one.

You might be able to spot what you think is fake. But, what you don't know is, you're just picking the class A ""fake"" products from the class B ""fake"" products. None of the ones you see on Alibaba are 'water products', which is the term we use for items that flow directly out of licensed factories. By ""fake"" I mean non authentic. In the end, your brain is probably not as full as you think. Go ahead, confirm it, dealerships can't tell because the material is the exact same, and they're foreigners. But decades of actual experience with knockoff products will tell you the truth.

null,false,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,null,"It's a bit vague because the UK has no written constitution. All we've got to go on is what other prime ministers and the Queen (who appoints the prime minister) do when there's an election, and there's only been about three occasions in the last 100 years where there wasn't a majority (the interwar years, 1973, and 2010). 

The best example is what happened in 2010. Gordon Brown advised the Queen to appoint David Cameron as prime minister and he attempted to form a government. The thing which is troubling about this is that the Queen is really the one with the power in this situation, so we can't be sure if she was picking David Cameron because he was the democratic obvious choice (being the leader of the largest party) or because the sitting prime minister advised her to. Technically the PM is still the PM until new one is appointed (so Cameron is still PM right now, despite the fact Parliament has been dissolved and therefore MPs cease to be MPs until 7th of May, when they're get elected) and the Queen basically always does what the PM advises (for example, knighthoods, declarations of war, dissolution of Parliament, command of the public services, are all royal prerogatives that the Queen is in control of, but does whatever the PM asks her to do. 

So who knows. Maybe if Labour is the largest party Cameron will still get first dips on forming a coalition because he can, as the sitting prime minister, ask the Queen to appoint him as the next prime minister. Or maybe the Queen will consider herself duty bound to pick the leader of the largest party. We just don't know.

Costa Rica is good, but you're over-estimating their quality and underestimating Jamaica's a bit.

Keep in mind that Jamaica would not need to win in Costa Rica to qualify. A simple draw combined with a win at home would keep Jamaica competitive, and a strengthened Jamaica squad could manage that (Jamaica has gotten results before in arguably more challenging environments, i.e. the Azteca).

Housing prices are an absolute joke. I'm not paid badly, but it feels like putting together a deposit is an endless task; every time I think I have a plan, the prices go up again. Even the crappiest of houses in Cambridge seem to go for ridiculous prices. Surrounding villages used to be better, but even they seem to be following the same trend; with the added bonus of trying to commute through the ridiculous traffic during rush hour.

Local clubs all seem to be run by the same group, meaning that whilst there are about four main venues, their settings, drinks, prices, etc. seem to be much of a muchness, and in terms of my age group, culturally, Cambridge feels pretty shallow. This is more of an issue for people like me who prefer a more alternative scene, however there are reports of the only alternative club I know of, the Q Club, currently looking to sell, so we won't even have that soon. I also love my small rock-type gigs by small, local bands, but trying to find anything in that scene seems pretty impossible. I've seen a few bands at the Portland Arms, but that seems to have rebranded lately to be less of an alternative venue too.

Buses are, on average, ""every ten minutes"" during the daytime. Unfortunately that can mean one every ten minutes, or nothing turning up for half an hour, then three turning up at once, which is damned annoying if you're looking to get somewhere sharpish. The oddest part is that in Cherry Hinton, I'm not that far from the start/end of two bus routes, the number 1, and number 3. Taking a bus heading towards the city centre, there's been hardly any traffic for them to contend with between the start of their route and my local stops (outside of rush hour) - so why am I seeing three buses on the same route turn up at once?

Driving can be a huge pain; as others have mentioned, there are terrible pot holes in places. There are also some horrendous speed bumps around some of the school areas too. I get it, drive more slowly, but some of them seriously test my suspension even at slow speeds. Driving's also not easy due to areas of massive congestion at times, such as the bridge passing the Beehive Centre, heading towards Newmarket Road, or coming from the road between Fulbourn and passing Cherry Hinton during rush hour.

Oh, and hardly any hills, Cambridge is incredibly flat and pretty devoid of scenery. Not sure how anybody would fix that, mind you!",null,0,null,1428632798,null,0,false,0,cq7b2xg,null,t3_2x320z,null,t1_cq7b2xg,null,t3_2x320z,null,null,null,1432302185,null,1,false,cambridge,t5_2qh8u,1,null

null,false,AthloneRB,null,null,null,"Jamaica's potential for a World Cup appearance is decent, especially with the kind of quality that those stars would bring to the squad. 

Keep in mind that Jamaica has come pretty close to repeating its 1998 WC appearance WITHOUT many English stars. If you were to add said stars, those chances would most certainly increase.

CONCACAF is more competitive than people think. Jamaica with the addition of players like Puncheon, Gayle, Rose, Ravel, and a couple of others would be more than a match for the likes of Honduras, Costa Rica, or Panama. Had Jamaica only managed to climb above Honduras this last cycle (which would have been very plausible with the strengthened squad I mentioned), they would have been 3rd, qualifying automatically behind the USA and CR. That's a very realistic scenario.

If Jamaica could only get a few of these players to see this and commit, then the chances of qualification would be quite good every cycle - Jamaica would be able to field a starting XI that could match any other in CONCACAF on paper. Unfortunately, most English-Jamaican stars (like most English fans in general) tend to have an overly dire opinion of the state of football in Jamaica (and most of CONCACAF beyond the USA/Mexico), which leads to their underestimating the benefits of representing Jamaica and the actual capability of the Jamaican football team. The island is not a world beater, but it simply isn't nearly as dire as so many in the UK make it sound, and the prospects of a future WC appearance simply are not as bleak as they are made out to be. There certainly is no good business case to be made for choosing zero international football (in the case of a player like Rose who will likely never be an England regular, or another like Nathan Dyer who'll just never even get a call-up) over a lengthy international career with the Reggae Boyz. Jamaica isn't the Bahamas or San Marino.

This agreement hasn't been tested in the past (throughout the entire cold war I might add) &amp; I don't believe it will be in the future because simply put the risks are far too high for everyone involved. Also yes I do believe if there was an attack on Romania we'd get involved, and so would America &amp; every other country in NATO because if they didn't it would be a worthless piece of paper. You know what would happen if those pacts weren't followed? A massive worldwide increase in military spending &amp; armaments increases, isolationism, nationalism (not the good kind) &amp; reduction in trade &amp; prosperity. It wouldn't just have an effect on relations between the EU &amp; Romania this would have an affect on all government to government relations between all states. American sphere would be destroyed, we'd see Eastern European states align themselves with Russia &amp; SEA nations with China. Also it should be noted whether the people are happy or not doesn't even matter here, they're not the ones making the decision. We could have millions in the streets protesting &amp; we'd still go to war if the government thought it was the right thing to do. 

I mean do you believe without nuclear weapons we could be attacked by another nuclear nation? Do you honestly believe that? I ask you again, do you think Germany is less safe than the UK because they do not have a nuclear deterrent? Do you not think if we were for some reason attacked by nuclear weapons that actually having them ourselves would in some ways be worse because we'd have more retaliatory strikes &amp; more human loss of life?

Big games I think it has be a 4-3-3 because it offers much more balance.

Yes, top four was the goal (as it should be for a club of our stature) but it's harder than ever to achieve that with having to compete with massively talented clubs like Chelsea, City, Arsenal, United and even (to an extent) clubs like Spurs and Southampton for one of those four spots.

But Spurs work hard for the local area and give both money and time to schools and charities (they pick a different charity each year - I volunteered at Kith and Kids and the difference they made was huge, plus the kids got to have a kickabout with Lee Young-Pyo) as well as the trickle down funds for local businesses, the demand for improved infrastructure which has frustratingly slowly been met and will now finally break through. This is a massive coup. It's huge for the area and I'm delighted. I'm angry that it took ten years and that the riots happened in that time, but it's over. The government no longer has any excuse to look the other way because there are millions of pounds coming from private business to kick things along.",null,0,null,1428646766,null,0,1428693355,0,cq7hlr2,null,t3_321nb0,null,t1_cq7hlr2,null,t1_cq7e3o0,null,null,null,1432305329,null,16,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,16,null

null,false,breezehair,null,null,null,"&gt;1) Why compare with Germany in particular? Because it has had declining or stagnating population for much of its recent past so it might help justify why UK house prices are high because its population is growing? 

I compare with Germany exactly because its population has been declining and therefore it has no housing problem!

UK population is growing which causes increased demand for housing, which pushes up rents and prices unless very large numbers of new dwellings are built. 

&gt; 2) If low interest rates are helping mortgages, why is it that that we still have the problems with housing? 

Low mortgage rates mean people can afford to borrow more which causes the price of housing (which is in limited supply) to go up.  Low interest rates are a windfall for those who own assets of all types.  Not good!

Higher prices then cause more houses to be built - but this is a slower process with a substantial time lag. 

&gt; 3) Much of the building boom in London is (luxury) housing.

Worse than that, it is housing as a money-laundered fixed asset for wealthy foreign buyers.  
   Actually there is much housing all types being built - but it does not keep pace with the growth in demand. 

&gt; 4) I don't understand your point. How do planning regulations encourage ownership, which is what you seem to be suggesting? Is it not more that ownership more likely generates stronger NIMBYism manifesting itself in planning decisions?

That was exactly my point; I was not clear.  Like it or not, strict planning regulations - which one might call ""taking home-owners' and existing residents' views into account"" - has been how things are done in the UK.  

&gt; 5) I look at population density and find for example that London is less dense than many other big cities in Europe like Paris and Milan.

This is because they have apartment blocks, which planning authorities in the UK have discouraged, probably after bad experiences with blocks designed in the 1960s. Time for a rethink? 

&gt;The UK also isn't the most dense EU country, and has an extremely similar density to Germany (one of your examples to compare with). Why should density even effect housing availability, tenure type, or price?

As others have remarked, population in the UK is concentrated in the South East. Scotland and Wales are not densely populated and housing is pretty cheap there. 

Why should density affect price?  An interesting and deep question!

Housing is a positional good -- typically (but not always) your house becomes less desirable and less valuable if new housing developments are built next to it. If local residents are allowed to have a say on what is built near them, they will tend to be selective about what new housing development they allow.   

In densely populated areas, the process of finding new development sites and getting planning permission tends to be more difficult and slower than in sparsely populated areas. This is a very broad generalisation; in the the UK green belt, it is very hard to get planning permission for new developments because the residents want it to stay as a green belt. I can see their point. 

Hence in densely populated areas it is politically difficult to rapidly build lots more dwellings, because any new development affects existing residents, so planning consent is harder to get and takes longer .

However, when I travel past places in the South East that I was familiar with decades ago, I always see far more houses than there used to be.

This sounds to me like a really stretched argument. Going by that, Martha studied at university because they wanted more of the twenty-something to watch the show? No kid watches Doctor Who because there's a teacher, they watch it because it tells adventures.

&gt;The problem is, all of the things that they've made her into just seem to fall flat. With other companions, their personality traits challenged the Doctor, or even stood out as a problem (Rose's jealousy, Amy's tendency to be a little too forward, etc) - which was great. It gave them depth. With Clara, everything about her is just, ""well of course she's this, because that's what the plot needs.""

I find this debatable too. For Rose and Amy you listed side traits of their character. Rose's main trait was being in love with the Doctor, and Amy's was having waited for him for twelve years, both of which were *very* plot-related. Clara, apart from being in love with Danny, also has a *lot* of side traits, which are ""condensed"" in her wiki page (http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Clara_Oswin_Oswald#Personality). Some of them affect the plot more than in the case of other companions, but that's just because Series 8 focused on the characters more than any other season of NuWho.

&gt; Biggest example of all: we know that she's the impossible girl, but that... really doesn't tell us much except that it gives the Doctor something to solve.

Funnily enough, that's the answer I was expecting. You know, the situation in the States isn't too far removed from what happened here, just here it happened in a smaller area and earlier. The tribes who populated Britain prior to the Norman conquest in 1066 didn't leave written records. What we know about them comes from the writings of Monks, who took upon themselves the task of recording their history - albeit with their own spin on things.

It's a shame that more effort isn't put into Pre-Colombian history. I get that the evidence is hard to find, but there's definitely a sense that discovering what came before is somehow less important than making ""new"" history.

And, you know, while it wasn't the Post-Colombian's ancestors who made that history, it's still *yours*. I say this in a wide sense, but *you* are the native Americans now, just as the Vikings, Normans, Saxons, etc became native Britons when they settled here.

* Real Techniques Starter Kit
* Real Techniques Silicone Eyeliner brush (nib?) and Shader brush
* MAC 217 &amp; 219
* Loew-Cornell 270 Maxine's Mop 3/8 (this is a paintbrush but it's excellent)
* Urban Decay 24/7 Shadow Pencil Blending brush

The UD brush is discontinued but can be purchased for Â£10 currently at Beauty Bay: http://www.beautybay.com/accessories/urbandecay/247shadowpencilblenderbrush/

The RT brushes are always cheapest on Amazon, in my experience. There are also people who sell individual (new) brushes from the sets on eBay, which I have taken advantage of.

MAC brushes are never discounted so I tend to get them from Frasers or Debenhams purely for reward points. There are also deals on Top Cashback so worth checking out if you use that site.

Finally, the paintbrush-as-makeup-brush idea is one I got from my mum initially, fuelled by this video which is a godsend: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9lPfKzQAXE

There are other videos/resources on this topic but the gist of it is that same bristles + same shape = same brush. :) I have several Loew-Cornell brushes in my collection, all of which are used regularly. They wash very well and are comparably cheap.

How weighty is a Snickers normally? Sure a multipack Snickers might be a lot bigger than an equivalent Mars, but is it much closer to a separate one, or are separate Snickers about 65g or something? (Maybe cocoa/caramel has gone up in price a lot more than peanuts?).

They're still money-grubbing bastards, and i'd much rather they put the price up than shrunk the bar size, but sizing up against Snickers might not be a good comparison.

Pardon me for stepping in, but there are plenty of nice reds at a tenner a bottle. Also plenty of overpriced shite that ain't worth a fiver because the supermarkets are cynical twats with zero compunction about how they relieve you of your brown drinking voucher. Bastards. So, it *can* be done, but it can also be a bit of a lottery.

Personally I'd toddle off down to Majestic Wines, but they have a half case minimum sale so you'll need Â£60 at a tenner a bottle. But they really know their stuff, they make a virtue of finding what *you* want, and they're actually pretty good value if you plump for the offers - there's always 20% off any given country, plus lots of other offers, such as discounts for two of the same thing.

But if you just want to drop a brown one (&amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;) right now, try Aldi's Gigondas, Asda's Vacqueyras, or at nearer Â£12 a pop one of the Marques de Casa reds available in most large supermarkets.

BT get enormous tax breaks on their fibre per km, as do Virgin Media. [Source](https://br0kent3l3ph0n3.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/how-bt-scores-in-the-fibre-rates-wars/)

&gt;The current rateable value applied to Other Operators is Â£230 per fibre pair-kilometre. On a multiplier of 45.2% for 2012/3, this gives rise to a tax charge of Â£103.96 per pair, or Â£51.98 per fibre.

&gt;Other Operators therefore pay some 18.43 times the rate paid by Openreach for link fibre on a FAC, and some 49.98 times that on a LRIC basis. If BTâs measure of link fibre was per fibre pair, then the difference would be 37 times and 100 times respectively.

null,false,firekraker51,null,null,null,"For me, it wasn't the script that was an issue (the stories involved were mostly pretty strong, possibly with the exception of the Caretaker which wasn't about plot anyway), it was the characterization.

Clara? Genius. She evolved from having huge interest as a plot device and little interest as a person last season to this season, where the plot device part is now largely irrelevant and her personality really stepped up to the plate. She's now a strong character with her own opinions, desires, traits, and major quirks. I like that she's incredibly stubborn, is a control freak, and stupidly brave in the right circumstances. I love that we start to see this all right from the get-go in Deep Breath, and we continue to see it throughout the season.

Danny's characterization was not as well done. His function in the plot was an admirable attempt at showcasing the ""real life"" counterpart to Clara's decisions to go with the Doctor. Yet we don't get to see enough of what Clara sees in Danny to empathize with that conflict. Still though, I have all of two problems with his character: one is he needed more time. Two is that entire mess with the future Pink being revealed; it just felt like they were trying to set him up as something which we as viewers were entirely not emotionally ready for at the time, and that really put me off.

My main problem with this series though is the characterization of the Doctor. I love Capaldi as an actor, and I understand that he (and the character of the Doctor) is trying to figure out what he's like, and so the personality is fluid. I get that.

What I don't like is his apparent lessening of empathy. For example, though it was all a ploy, he did lead Clara to believe he'd abandoned her more than once. We got to see Clara shine through because of it, but it seemed detrimental to the Doctor's character. The problem is, the Doctor is (at least in his NuWho incarnations thus far) all about that empathy and connection with his companions, and I see it less here than ever before.

Also, his heightened dislike of soldiers (and therefore, immediately, Pink) seemed really forced for the sake of plot development with the aforementioned Clara/Danny conflict (and as we learn later, the series finale's big turnarounds).

Most of all, what I really don't like about series 8 is that, barring Deep Breath and the finale, I've gotten absolutely no emotional impact from the show at all. Nine, Ten, Eleven - they could all spur me to tear up with a few words, a facial expression, even just their deafening silence. I haven't felt that at all with Capaldi except briefly in his very first episode, though the cameo scene with Eleven still felt more emotionally satisfying.

Clara definitely made me feel something with the post-car crash scenes, and some others after that. I'm really hoping that'll continue, and Capaldi will get to tap into that a bit more, in series 9.",null,0,null,1428653867,null,0,false,0,cq7jk4g,null,t3_31yopj,null,t1_cq7jk4g,null,t3_31yopj,null,null,null,1432306250,null,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3,null

I disagree with a hell of a lot but the conservatives were restrained by the Lib Dems refusing to do a lot of things especially towards the end. We could've done with someone doing that when New Labour invaded Iraq, Introduced and Raised tuition fees, let Rail Fees rise, massively expanded PFI and a whole bunch of other stuff that were conservative wet dreams.

The trouble is, in London I learned to take that to the extreme of 'why take the risk at all?'.

I cycled from Orpington to Whitechapel and back every weekday over one summer (about six months) - and went over three bonnets. Each time, I could see even before it happened that the person simply didn't think to look in my direction when pulling out, and each of them jumped out full of apologies...but I realised that it was really a game of odds, eventually I'd lose and that I only had one set of legs. Since then, I don't really understand why it's so important to take the risk at all; it's not some leafy village, it's *Central London* - why, out of all the methods of transport, take the most vulnerable option?

null,false,bottomlines,null,null,null,"&gt;due to the way NATO is structured an attack on any NATO country is an attack on all

Again, just an agreement! You are totally correct that the risks of welching on the agreement are high, but if we are really in a situation where Russia invades Eastern Europe (or similar), we are already in a very risky situation and it has already escalated significantly. We can only presume that Russia (or whoever started it all) thought that they could get away with it, and they wouldn't be taking that step without either being desperate or having carefully calculated the move. In either case, our own nuclear weapons are a trump card to play which can quickly end their aggression, if needed. That alone is a significant deterrent.

&gt;You know what would happen if those pacts weren't followed? A massive worldwide increase in military spending &amp; armaments increases, isolationism, nationalism (not the good kind) &amp; reduction in trade &amp; prosperity. It wouldn't just have an effect on relations between the EU &amp; Romania this would have an affect on all government to government relations between all states.

Absolutely. WW3 would tend to do that! I'm not saying that countries would lightly give up on NATO etc. But think from the point of view of the UK - would sending troops, spending Â£BNs and risking getting nuked really be worth helping Romania, or preserving NATO? Even from the US point of view (arguably the guys with the most to lose), I still find it a hard sell that continued loyalty from the UK, Japan and others is worth THAT much cost.

&gt;Also it should be noted whether the people are happy or not doesn't even matter here, they're not the ones making the decision. We could have millions in the streets protesting &amp; we'd still go to war if the government thought it was the right thing to do.

Not strictly true. The protests you are referring to were really not that large in comparison to what would happen if we were going to fight on the Eastern front. With Afghanistan we were going to bomb some guys in caves and Toyota pickup trucks. In a proper war there would be a massive risk. I even think a huge proportion of politicians would refuse to support that.

&gt;I mean do you believe without nuclear weapons we could be attacked by another nuclear nation?

I think it's unlikely. But I also think it would be even LESS unlikely if we have our own nuclear weapons.

&gt;I ask you again, do you think Germany is less safe than the UK because they do not have a nuclear deterrent?

Again, Germany isn't ""unsafe"" as such. Part of their safety is also due to geographical location. But are they less safe than the US, UK and France who have nukes - yes, they are. Germany is protected by a small, relatively capable armed forces, and some agreements with other countries (and of course US troops in Germany too). But the UK is protected by a capable armed force, agreements with other countries AND ever-present submarines capable of obliterating you from 7000 miles away. I think it makes a difference ;) 

&gt;Do you not think if we were for some reason attacked by nuclear weapons that actually having them ourselves would in some ways be worse because we'd have more retaliatory strikes &amp; more human loss of life?

I appreciate the point. However, it's obvious that when the first people carry out the first strike and we decide to use ours, the system has failed already. The only thing to do would be act quickly and try to use our arsenal to stop the aggressor doing more damage - probably by targeting their launch facilities, runways and economic centres (such as pipelines, oil fields etc), rather than population centres, trying to minimise any further damage.

The point of Trident is to act as a deterrent. As I mentioned before, that doesn't mean revenge and tit-for-tat like ""you blast us, so we blast you"". It means to make the cost of aggression too high and to neuter any strategic advantage somebody hoped to gain. Russia wouldn't just attack us for lulz - it would be about money, resources, power etc... all of which we can fuck up using Trident. That essentially forces them to the debating table, rather than using force to achieve those goals.

Let me put a question to you. Would you be happy in a world where the US and France didn't have nukes? Personally I think the world would be much much worse if Russia, China, Pakistan etc had nukes and NATO allies didn't. I wouldn't be too thrilled if France was going to disarm, and I'd be very worried if the US was going to disarm. As such, I think we should play our part. NATO is only as strong as it's members, and most of us fail to even meet the spending threshold for our conventional forces. We aren't perfect but the UK is still surely one of the good guys in the world and so I think we should play our part. Trident also gives us a guaranteed seat at any debating table, and ensures that the voice of the UK will always be heard. I don't love nuclear weapons, but we can't un-invent the technology, and while our rivals are modernising their armies and increasing spending, we would be absolutely insane to not at least keep ours up to date!",null,0,null,1428655829,null,0,false,0,cq7k0c9,null,t3_31znuv,null,t1_cq7k0c9,null,t1_cq7cyx5,null,null,null,1432306462,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I will predict a Lab minority government with a confidence and support agreement using LD SNP PC. But the tories having a few more seats then Lab. 

I can see this being an interesting government with the 3 minor parties gaining a huge amount of clout as Lab will not be able to pass anything without support from one or more of them.

The guy did well on few occasions, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. While defending he can match the attacker's speed and strength but he's no defender. Preferrably we won't use Ibe, Markovic or Sterling as wingbacks that much anymore, because that gives our opponents another weakness to exploit, we already have Moreno's side which is currently quite weak. 

That is also the reason why I think Rodgers insists on playing Henderson, rather than Markovic, Sterling or Lallana, at wingback when we have other midfielders fit to fill the midfield two. It's fine for few games to have attacking players playacting as defenders but over time the opponents will exploit it more and more. Henderson is more conservative, has more stamina and is more athletic than the attacking players mentioned. While it's not ideal, it's about the best we can do without losing the link-up and exploiting us too much on the right wing.",null,0,null,1428657117,null,0,false,0,cq7kaoq,null,t3_3238sn,null,t1_cq7kaoq,null,t1_cq7jctj,null,null,null,1432306598,null,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7,null

Mutually assured destruction is debatably not a very sustainable long term solution to ""world peace"" so there is little point using this as an argument as too many people subscribe to the ""If we nuke them, they will nuke us back"" or ""There has been 70 years of world peace so its working"" philosophies. 

Basically, you can't prove this argument either way.  Its like the US/UK equivalent of gun control on a global scale.  Do you have a gun to protect yourself against nutters with guns, or do you have a society that doesn't have guns in the first place, and so much less chance of encountering a nutter with a gun?

My feeling is that although it maybe nice to have Trident, we can't afford it anyway so it negates any moral argument before it starts.  

If you believe that the UK has had to sort itself out with cost cutting, we certainly don't have the cash to spend on Trident.  Maybe when we have funded the NHS, looked after our disabled, educated our kids, built affordable housing and have invested in a sustainable long term economy we should have that moral debate, but at the moment we don't have the cash to spend on it anyway.",null,0,null,1428657144,null,0,1428657333,0,cq7kawj,null,t3_320yz3,null,t1_cq7kawj,null,t3_320yz3,null,null,null,1432306601,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null
