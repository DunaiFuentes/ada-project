* Slowing the rate of welfare cuts, probably by extending them from 2 years to 3 or even 4 years. A lot of the measures will probably be about adjusting who qualifies (i.e. removing housing benefits from under 25s) or removing some of the more generous subsidies to landlords.

* While pensioners are protected, pensions themselves won't be - and the pension tax thresholds will probably come down further.

* They may accelerate either the rise in the minimum wage (which would be a big thumbs up for their blue collar conservatism) OR they might raise the personal tax allowance further to push even more people out of income tax entirely.

* There probably won't be as many give-aways as there have been the recent pre-election budgets because he'll be keen to get as much of the ""pain"" of their economic reforms out the way now at the start. 

* If there are ""big give aways"" it's probably likely to be an expansion of their starter homes project which is yet to start even in earnest, and was a huge manifesto promise. If the conservatives fail to build those 200,000 homes in the next 5 years (and thats actually pretty tight turn-around for those sorts of projects) then it'll hurt them in the 2020 election - which increasingly looks set to be played out over the housing crisis.

So despite all the Guardianista hyperbole, unless you are actively receiving a large amount of housing benefit it's probably going to be a good budget for you. We certainly aren't expecting tax rises - as the governments plan seems to be to reduce the size of the state and reduce the amount people pay in tax.

I'm curious, for instance, about how much you've spoken to Muslim women about how they feel about gender segregation in mosques.

null,false,lewormhole,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,null,"I think it's a rather obvious trend in the media.

There's this odd tendency on reddit for user to passive-aggressively demand peer-reviewed journals and statistics even when we discuss things as nebulous and difficult to define as societal attitudes. The desire to discuss what we see in the media as around us critically is often dismissed as a failure to reach some equally nebulous standard of ""logic"" or ""reason."" If that is the way you are approaching this discussion, I encourage you to stop now because that is not what you will get from me.

There is a growing trend of evangelism amongst our politicians. There is an all party pro-life group currently trying to devolve abortion law in order to attack women's bodily autonomy and reproductive health. This receives wry little air time.

Compared to Muslim extremism (which is treate with widespread disdain and fear even when it is extreme traditionalism instead of violent extremism), Christians on what most of us would consider the ""extreme"" end of the spectrum hold rather a lot of power. They are a part of the political process. This is widely accepted. Their religious beliefs aren't widely criticised. Why not? You might argue that they don't threaten public safety, but as a woman, I feel far more afraid of evangelical MPs who want to remove my rights than I do of Muslim extremists, and I say that as someone who felt, in spit of myself, nervous on the subway yesterday.

If you are going to say something like this, atleast give some information regarding it.

I assume you're talking about Suarez, Sterling and either Borini or Torres.

Suarez was a long ordeal, but in the end he didn't force himself out we sold him for the right price to the right club. He wanted to win the Champions League, and we sent him there for a price we agreed upon in his contract the previous year.

Sterling wants to go but the club hold all the cards. He wants to leave because he wants more money and to win trophies. Some people place money above trophies, others trophies above money. Raheem wants both, so it's going to have to be a club like City who offer it to him.

Torres left cos he thought we bought Suarez to replace him, he kicked off and Chelsea offered us a huge amount of money (50m) on the last day of the Window. If that happens any other time during that January window, or at any time at all during the Summer he doesn't leave Liverpool. Miscommunication and lots of outside factors involved in this one. Not sure its a club underlying issue, but they could have done better.

Mascherano went from Liverpool to Barcelona. That's not him rage quitting Liverpool, that's him reaching Barcelona, a career-best moment for him.

So no, there's no underlying issue, for as long as there are players from clubs like Southampton, Burnley, Charlton and Bolton want to play for Liverpool. there will be Liverpool players will want to play for Barcelona.

They will not be pressured into doing something they don't want to do. 

If Man City do not offer the cash then Sterling will be kept and forced to train with the u21s or whatever until he apologises - just like Suarez. Then it will be water under the bridge and we can reopen negotiations on a contract with a release clause that satisfies both sides. 

If he rejects that then he can stay on his 40k per week salary and keep training with the reserves. We'll sell him on the next summer if someone meets our revised asking price.

FSG has no time for player power. They are the ones with the balls and they are in charge. That was made abundantly clear with Suarez. Raheem (and especially his agent) are a bit too thick to realise it.

Evangelical christians are most definitely a tiny minority in the UK now and are almost always met with opposition in the form of protests, liberal parties that out number them, feminist groups and so on. For an evangelical christian, the worst they get is anti-abortion and spread homophobia.

Yet the larger and arguably more dangerous trend of muslim extremism, where womens oppression is seen as a normality in the population, the extreme goes much further.

imagine comparing both forms of extremism on a scale, then compare then by number.

&gt; Christians on what most of us would consider the ""extreme"" end of the spectrum hold rather a lot of power. 

as do Muslim MPs who allow faith schools to flourish, suppress freedom of speech and hate preachers who aren't met with opposition like womens rights.

&gt; You might argue that they don't threaten public safety, but as a woman, I feel far more afraid of evangelical MPs who want to remove my rights than I do of Muslim extremists

and as ive just mention above, these types of Muslim extremists exist in our government too, imagine if 24% of british christians believed that violence was justified because you draw a picture of satiricle picture of Mary or a pro abortion cartoon.

Do you think your average woman wants to cover her face and feet, or other parts of her body? or is it because they were brought up in a society or family that encouraged those beliefs onto her from a young age.

You think people are imposing their views onto muslim women because they think they should have a choice of where they want to sit? if they really want to sit away from Men, sure they have the choice, but is that not a sexist choice too?

It's also unclear whether central government will want to take the extra money raised by these higher rents. If the council itself gains nothing from increasing its rent then it isn't going to do it. Simple as that. 

If your local council is Labour then I doubt they will even bother to implement the new guidelines. If not, it's likely there would still be a level of negotiation involved over what the new rental figure would be. Any councils that implement it would likely have some sort of sliding scale policy rather than immediately increasing to full market value at £40000 earnings.

If your entitlement was £180 PW under the new system, but your contracting out period accrued an assumed GMP of £70 PW you'd receive £110 PW from the state pension, due to a £70 offset.

In reality, and we have seen this borne through in pension statements received by clients, for the next ten or twenty years retirees will be due to receive from the state roughly what they were due under the old system. The changes will mostly affect those in their forties or younger.

Mephedrone is significantly safer to take regularly in terms of neurotoxicity (although by no means safe.) MDMA releases something like 10,000 times more serotonin than your brain is designed to process, and dosing frequently can permanently damage your brain.

Edit - if you took 200x a strong dose of MDMA like people were doing with mephedrone you would be seriously, life-threateningly ill.

It's hard to compare relative drug harms because each individual person has a brain chemistry which will be more susceptible to certain narcotics that they will be more likely to abuse. However, if you were addicted to MDMA and taking it in the doses people were/are taking mephedrone you should scientifically be in significantly more danger of long term damage.

I get why fans are pissed off and see his wanting to leave as a betrayal to the club (how the fuck did he get so good? Alongside whom did he have such a stunning season? He wouldn't be worth half as much had he not played next to guys like Suarez and Sturridge and had the opportunity to prosper from their talents, Suarez especially). I believe it's also in his own best interests to stay at Liverpool, especially at his age.

That being said, I totally get why he wants to leave, from his perspective at least. Even if he hadn't tasted success in 2013/14, he tasted the thrill of being in a team that was an absolute force to be reckoned. To come from that to the subsequent season, which saw us toothless, losing against sides like Aston Villa, Hull and Palace must have been like coming from the greatest narcotics high to the worst downer with extreme suddenness.

An older player, with the experience and perspective of years might look at that and say ""Fair enough, next season will doubtless show improvement"", but Sterling, for all his talents and maturity beyond his years, does not have that perspective and when he sees Utd turn their fortunes around in the space of a season, surely he must worry that a career at Liverpool won't bring him success or it'll be a long wait for it. Also, having played alongside the likes of Suarez, he must want to play with that kind of talent again, and he doesn't feel it's there at Liverpool, not while he can spy the likes of Aguero and Silva at City, especially not when following the exit of Suarez, we bring in the likes of Lambert and Balotelli. He must have wanted the same things fans wanted, a marquee signing, a star and like the fans, he must have been gutted looking around the dressing seeing what we got, again, especially in light of having played with Suarez.

Not helping things is a money grubbing agent whispering into his ear, telling him he is selling himself and his talents short being at a club that has come up trophy-less for the last 4 years. Also not helping is a fan-base calling him names and insulting him without knowing all the facts (and I say that having made several assumptions above).

In the end, I think it's for the best that he leaves. Dragging this saga out does nothing for us (outside of stalling for a better fee) and surely it must be a distraction for other members of the squad, especially new players.

I was finally through the final stage, and I was told that there would be a 12 hour training day that I wouldn't be paid for it. They told me to wear waterproofs and comfortable shoes. I told them I wasn't interested right then.

He said ""to read messages"" would require a warrant (but not one signed by a judge, that's another issue), but the proposals (what little we know of them) would require ISPs to collect all messages.  The metadata would be a free-for-all for the authorities receiving it.  It would only be those cases when a human wanted to read the content (which would be a tiny percentage anyway, for logistical reasons if nothing else) would a warrant be required.

Nothing Cameron has said rules that out.

The Snowden archives sheds a lot of light on this, the previous draft bill was released before the Snowden story broke, and contained a lot of confusing clauses about ""ability to track users across multiple services""; but when the Snowden archives began to be published, it became apparent that was exactly what GCHQ was already doing.  Similarly, the NSA got around American law by claiming that collecting and (much worse) algorithmic analysis of content were exempt because ""you had to get a warrant to see the results"".  But of course, if the system flashed up an alert based on content you could always get a warrant because the alert was grounds for suspicion.

It's a massive cliche to draw parallels with 1984, but this is classic double-think.  ""We won't spy on everyone's communication, the security services will need a warrant.""

That's not, I don't think, a particularly pleasant way to behave. At best it's pretty condescending.

But the argument was 'We should have a proper debate!' Now, I don't think having someone whose views are outdated, unpopular and have been repeatedly rejected by the electorate is what makes a debate 'proper', but, again, lets be charitable and say we should have a proper debate and Corbyn's views should be part of that.

But then the fact is, we already had the 'Should we be pro- or anti-austerity?' debate as a party: Diane Abbott and Ed Balls both ran on anti-austerity tickets and lost. The party voted for pro-austerity candidates to first *and* second place in that ballot. So, not only have we agreed, as a party, that we don't particularly want Corbyn's socialism, we also agreed that we don't want his anti-austerity. And yet, here we are, having the same debate again.

I haven't actually argued that Corbyn 'shouldn't' be on the ballot (although I'll certainly argue that he shouldn't win and that people shouldn't vote for him, as is my right). However, the rules we have in place are pretty clear about the PLP picking the candidates. What has instead happened is that a few members of the PLP have lent their support to a candidate who has no chance of winning anything and who, were he somehow elected leader, would almost certainly immediately face a vote of no confidence. So, instead of having a proper debate among the people the PLP are actually willing to back, we're having a silly, mock debate including three people the PLP might really support and one random dude we threw in there for some reason.

Then we have the whole additional thing where we have people who aren't in the Party at all deciding who our biggest affiliate backs for leader, and the fact that at least some of Corbyn's support comes from people, on the left or the right, who actively and openly want to destroy the Labour Party, and it should be apparent why I, /u/TrickyDickNixonbot and a lot of other people are pretty infuriated by this whole thing.",null,0,null,1436344672,null,0,false,0,csvzwsh,null,t3_3cf72b,null,t1_csvzwsh,null,t1_csveult,null,null,null,1437680471,null,1,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

It's a different view on the data which paints a different picture. We should try and look at all reasonable combinations to see how we feel about it. Both my statement and the headline are based on the same data, yet have a different feeling to them but *shouldn't*. Similarly, the headline could be around over 40's thinking it makes the country worse/makes no difference but under 40's think it makes the country better. Or about how political affiliation links to it, going from UKIP (77% worse), Con (44% worse), Lab (25% worse) and Lib Dem (21% worse). Or the difference in views between ""upper middle - lower middle class"" and ""skilled working class - non working"".

Or that the only two groups with &gt;=50% ""makes it worse"" were UKIP and the over 60's (the over 60's represent 28% of the weighted sample). However, &gt;= 50% ""makes it better"" covers Lib Dems, 18-39s, London and Scotland. 

All from the same data, yet paints different views. We should look at all of them to come to a more rounded understanding.

I simply wished to underline that ""More are against than for"" is not the same as ""most are against"".

A melting pot is the idea that all the culture blend into one. Everyone adopting each other's traditions and customs until everyone essentially has the same culture.

Meanwhile multiculturalism is everyone keeping their own traditions and customs whilst still integrating with the local community. A Chinese person celebrating different new year, or a Muslim person observing Ramadan, and just generally people wearing the clothing and observing the holidays of their home culture, shouldn't make any difference to how they interact with us.

 In fact, aren't melting pots only possible with multiculturalism? People end up adopting each other's customs only because they befriend people who have their own customs. Like, for example, how we've adopted the tradition of German markets as a result of German immigrants wishing to maintain their own traditions. Plus where I live in London (Elephant &amp; Castle) actually does have a multicultural vibe it - like you see everyone (mostly) getting along whilst still observing their own customs. Walking down the street, you can see a vibrant Afro-Caribbean influence, but then you also see a vibrant middle eastern influence on the same street, as well as a Chinese/Vietnamese influence, as well as a Spanish influence, as well as a Polish influence.

Prepping, and continuing to prep nutritious, healthy food on an ongoing basis requires an investment of time and resources (more than you might imagine) that some people simply don't have.

And it's not so much that there's no time for making healthy food, it's that it requires genuine mental effort and dedication to continue eating healthily. You need to ensure that you have a good run of days where you have healthy food available to start getting into the habit. I read somewhere it takes at least a month of dedication to get into a regular habit, or break an existing one.

There's a vicious circle involved here too. Unhealthy food leads to depression and lack of motivation.

In the Lacazette case, we've no way to pressure Lyon; they're in the CL group stages, there's other (more attractive) suitors, he's got time on his contract, and Lacazette isn't cunting up the place wanting to leave. 

So we'll only submit a bid if we think we've talked him/his agent and Lyon around. Which honestly seems unlikely.

&gt;The Provisional IRA also carried out attacks in other countries such as West Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, where British soldiers were based.[75] Between 1979 and 1990, eight unarmed soldiers and six civilians died in these attacks, including the British Ambassador to the Netherlands Sir Richard Sykes.[76] On one occasion, the IRA shot dead two Australian tourists in the Netherlands, claiming its members mistook them for off-duty British soldiers.[77] On another occasion an IRA gunman wearing a British Army uniform shot dead Heidi Hazell, a German woman, as she sat alone in her car[78] She was waiting near a British Army married quarter in Unna. They claimed she had been shot ""in the belief that she was a member of the British Army garrison at Dortmund"". Her husband was a British Army staff sergeant.

When I left 14 months employment, I was not paid any accrued holiday money in lieu of taking a holiday. My contract stated nothing about Holiday or payment in lieu, and my employers kept it secret in the hope that employee's would be ignorant to the fact that they are owed holiday and ergo, lose their entitlement as the year rolled over (This was then money the company could keep)

Once I threatened Small Claims Court, my employer got in touch with me (on the very last day of the 7 days I gave them to reply) saying he was sorting it.

Fast forward 2 months later and I was paid less than I was owed to the tune of £500. I was paid £950 in total, being informed that work I did from June 2013 - Dec 31st 2013 is forfeit as I did not claim holiday in that period and the new year has rolled over.

I think this new law is a terrible idea, and I'm all for a liberal drugs policy, but I don't think the above statement is entirely true.

Synthetic cannabinoids don't have exactly the same effect as cannabis. They're similar, but not the same. They're also a hell of a lot cheaper than cannabis, and I mean, orders of magnitudes cheaper. I've not looked at this stuff in the past 5 years, but when the JWH* cannabinoids were popular, you could get 1g of some of the JWHs for sometimes less than a fiver online, and an effective dosage was in the range of 10 - 50mg. Basically, they were a lot LOT cheaper and one apparently got a lot lot more intoxicated than cannabis (not always in a good way though).

I do think use of synthetic cannabinoids would probably drop if they legalised cannabis, but I think it's an overstatement to say that there'd be no market at all for them. I agree with most of what else you're saying though.

You are dead right that correlation does not equal cause, lots of factors could affect it, but it is interesting to note that meph does not have the same cardiotoxicity and was cheaper and more available - it seems likely that it would have been a contributing factor.

&gt;There were 169 deaths involving cocaine in 2013, an increase of 22% from 139 deaths in 2012. However, the number of deaths involving cocaine have been variable over the last few years, with a peak in 2008 of 235 and a low of 112 in 2011. The male mortality rate declined significantly between 2008 and 2011 by over a half, but has since increased to 4.8 deaths per million population in 2013. The equivalent rate in females has continued to be significantly lower than for males despite a 57% rise (from 0.7 to 1.2 deaths per million population in 2012 and 2013 respectively).

Then there are the buildings I couldn't even recognise, which I can guess the probable location of, but they're not there now. Also the rowing club's old building was basically a hangar, possibly a relic of the war.

In the 1974 footage of my town, there's one street that appears a couple of times, a street I'm very familiar with. It became one-way about 6 years ago, and the car in the footage went the ""wrong way"" when of course it was two way at the time. A later shot of the same street revealed the cinema - utterly unchanged in the interim 41 years - and a pub called the Carpenter's Arms, which shut a few years ago after repeatedly getting caught serving minors, and is now a couple of flats, but externally looks the same. Meanwhile in the same video, there's a livestock market occupying a prime location in the middle of town, with shots that appear to be from the top of the church tower at the other end of town, houses around as they are now, cricket field behind as it still is, but the livestock market is long gone, and there's a supermarket and lots of car parking there now.

It's kinda weird seeing how things are different - and how things are the same. The cinema shocked me, a little. Compared to the rest of town, it's new. But it's older than 1974 by a fair few decades - opened 1937 according to their website.

They offer their customers discounts and/or outright payments if they agree to be part of a Demand Response scheme that gives Company C the ability to do certain things with their power draw (eg turn off/down their heating or air conditioning, turn off their fridge for up to an hour at a time, etc...). Company C then markets itself as a *provider* of power generation not because it *creates* megawatts, but because it can *reduce* them (which is almost the same thing and is allowed).

Energy Company D is actually a community bargaining cooperative: they operate in a few local villages and have got most of the people in those villages signed up: the ""company"" is one guy that lives locally. They bypass traditional energy companies entirely and, because they're a big enough segment of demand, can contract on the wholesale market and buy power direct from generation providers at wholesale cost.

Energy Companies E-G are bog standard ""Big Six"" types.

All these companies exist, in fact multiple companies exist doing the exact same thing per letter of the alphabet, all you have to do is spend 10 minutes on compare the market to find them.

I don't know who wrote these reports saying competition isn't possible in the energy market, because they evidently don't really understand the energy market. By your standards competition within the automobile market isn't possible either because every car is still a car.

You're mistaking what's actually a natural monopoly here. The electricity *network* is a natural monopoly, and that's why the companies that run them can't fart without Ofgem agreeing that it's value for money. Energy retail and energy generation have plenty of room for creativity and competition.

The problem is people are lethargic. Despite being more than willing to bitch and moan about how the big bad companies are ripping them off, they make excuses when it comes to sitting down in front of their computer and switching. So fucking what if it takes 2 hours to do: for 2 hours work you're saving yourself hundreds of pounds. What job pays hundreds of pounds an hour? Very few. Switching your provider pays that, but so few will actually sit down and do it!

What do you define as British culture and explain why Chinatown and Rusholme are okay but not Bradford?The problem is a huge chunk of British culture is influenced by colonialism. From the fact that there is pepper on your dinner table to the fact that chintz is considered really British (both are Indian).The thing is there are people who haven't mixed all that much. They are considered okay because they are quiet and rich. Muslims are mainly British Bangladeshi and Pakistanis and are much poorer than British Indians or Turks who follow the same faith. This has to do with how they immigrated BTW, all the major Asian areas are industrial towns. These are factory workers who lost their jobs. No retrainable skills and they don't have the same hunger for education as the more insular Sikhs, Hindus And Chinese. So they stay poor and have lower social mobility.These minorities are okay because they are seen in a more positive light. Their kids study really hard, they don't break the law and they often produce extremely skilled labour. So they are considered as integrated.Put it this way, had my parents adopted the culture of people around them we would be poorly educated. When I got a B at my gcse in French my parents were furious. I had A*s in everything else. White kids parents were happy they passed, mine were furious cause I didn't pass as expertly. That's a bit over the top but that sort of thing shows the level of value on education from the Asian community. I fear that asians and Muslims are a handy scapegoat. Remember black people are often held up as an example of non integration when they integrated way more than that. They gave up clothes, food, literature, language and even their faith and names to be more acceptable t British sensibility and that's still not enough. Hell the only reason I think Indians, East asians and Jews don't face the claims of being against integration is because the argument looks daft since it demands we study less and work less....No ones able to tell me what traditional art form and culture of the UK they help protect while decrying Asians and their lack of interest in British culture.",null,0,null,1436346490,null,0,false,0,csw0cpp,null,t3_3cit2x,null,t1_csw0cpp,null,t1_csvxum6,null,null,null,1437680848,null,41,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,41,null

Firstly, for the away kit, on Eden Hazard there is a [red band around his arm](http://i.gyazo.com/65ef15f3483e777a93a3e095450ab48f.png), which is in all of the [leaks](https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/chelsea-away-1.jpg) for the away kit, and it is [listed as white](http://i.gyazo.com/a736478b034c6abc26d36c45c76b90c8.png).

Secondly, on the home kit you can see the [red and white just where the sleeve stops](http://i.gyazo.com/39ccc5bf6875bbd0cb2396e7ecdbbac0.png), just like the [leaks](http://i.gyazo.com/3647d955d57ecff6112e6db561ac142d.png) show. Also in [this image](http://i.gyazo.com/39ccc5bf6875bbd0cb2396e7ecdbbac0.png) you can see (very feintly, you might need to have a look on the page yourself at this) the Y of the yokohama logo in red. 

Finally, we can see [it has a crew neck](http://i.gyazo.com/932567e1de0dd18a4be125b1fd22f484.png) rather than a collar or anything whacky, also seen in the [leaks](http://i.gyazo.com/3647d955d57ecff6112e6db561ac142d.png)

I find it very odd that these leaks were out at Christmas if you remember, and that is the final design (probably) of the shirt. 

Detective /u/gingersawr over and out. 

**EDIT :** But wait there's more! The goalkeeper kit will be [green](http://i.gyazo.com/dd0afc665598bc6d099efd5f20464818.png), and Courtois has [retained number 13](http://i.gyazo.com/37989dfe3c50e28aea797f6a044149b5.png). Also interesting to notice no Falcao on the list. 

**EDIT 2 :** Not done just yet, the [home socks will be white](http://www.chelseamegastore.com/stores/chelsea/en/products/kitselector/chelsea-home-kit-2015-16/chelsea-home-socks-2015-16-white/160319) and the [away socks will be blue](http://www.chelseamegastore.com/stores/chelsea/en/products/kitselector/chelsea-away-kit-2015-16/chelsea-away-socks-2015-16-blue/160309)

Also thanks to /u/iceytoa1 who [lightened the photo up](http://i.imgur.com/x5dWCEW.png), we can see the dark pinstripes down the middle of the shirt, also seen in the [leaks](http://talksport.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/201502/chelsea-15-16-home-kit_0.jpg?itok=3Z6gsYGo).

The ""British culture"" tends to be about keeping to ourselves, we just simply won't interact with people if we don't want to. That combined with nationalistic media/government rhetoric makes immigrants feel isolated, as we won't interact with them, they feel like we are hostile to them. So instead they seek out others from their home country who share their experience, to stick together in solidarity.

Tl;dr multiculturalism would probably involve less ghettos if we didn't effectively ""ghettoise"" ourselves.

EDIT: in fact, the reason I believe elephant and castle has been relatively successful in this respect is that the council has given many successful opportunities for the community to get together with various community outreach programs. Get people from different cultures together for one community event and you already have the recipe for more successful multiculturalism. It turns out a lot of immigrants would love to share their culture, and partake in ours, we just got to give them opportunities to do so where they don't feel threatened. I know we tend to be cynical about the idea of organising sober events to get strangers to interact with each other in a wholesome fashion, but these community events are more successful than you think.",null,0,null,1436346908,null,0,1436348437,0,csw0g8q,null,t3_3cit2x,null,t1_csw0g8q,null,t1_csw06ms,null,null,null,1437680904,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

Just thinking about this, I wonder if it's because of a) the greater shock factor after 9/11, which was a lot of people's introduction to the likes of al-Qaeda as a terrorist force in the west. Whereas by 2005, it wasn't out of the blue to see London be attacked after Madrid and 9/11, and the UK had experienced decades of city bombings by the IRA as well.

But I almost think the main thing was that immediately after 7/7, you had profile after profile of the 52 victims, and a bunch of them (as you'd expect from a crowd of Londoners) were Muslims. Girls who wore the hijab, dads, people who'd been born here or moved here and raised their children here. And they were just all normal people leaving devastated families. It's hard to demonise an ethnicity when the four terrorists are outnumbered in the deaths by the other Muslims they killed.

I think there was an element of this with Charlie Hebdo too (although not as much as there should have been). I mean those attacks killed three Muslims - the atheist raised-Muslim guy who worked at the magazine, the poor cop everyone saw get shot, and the Muslim guy who worked at the Jewish grocery store and helped the Jewish customers hide from the attackers.

I'm Brtish and I've lived all over Europe, only in non-Enlish speaking countries.

Assimilation is unbelievably difficult when their language is not your first. You never fully understand a culture or society as you do your own and you never really feel a part of it no matter how fluent you are in the language. People will always find a way to remind you you're not one of them, you will always find a way to remind yourself of the same thing.

That isn't unbearable. You end up with a mixed social group don't her immigrants and locals, usually ones who've lived abroad, and you participate in most aspects of culture but you quite often make a faux pas because you don't understand something or get frustrated because things are just a bit different there and it doesn't make sense to you.

The weirdest bit is when you move back to your ""home"" country and you kinda feel the same way. You've lost that deep connection to your prion all culture. It's a weird experience and you end up with a weird sense of self.

Most of my friends are people like me who've moved nomadic ally between cultures throughout their lives. People gravitate towards people with similar cultural experiences. It's why immigrants stick together.

I hope you move abroad because it's an amazing experience but I'd caution you against the idea you have about it right now. I used to think that's how I'd do it too, then you do it and you understand why immigrants behave the way they do.",null,0,null,1436347133,null,0,false,0,csw0i78,null,t3_3cit2x,null,t1_csw0i78,null,t1_csw08rn,null,null,null,1437680935,null,196,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,196,null

I'm in no way saying that mephedrone is some kind of 'goldilocks' party drug where addiction can be marginalised because of its relative safety in terms of cardio and neuro-toxicty compared to its alternatives. As I've said it's hard to quantify danger between drugs because people react to them differently in different ways but it appears as though it is around as dangerous as street amphetamine, which is also a Class B drug in the UK.

If you were determined to use a party drug regularly (i.e. more than every 2 or 3 months,) mephedrone will always be healthier than using cocaine and would be a healthier option in most cases than MDMA.

Of course the above is assuming rational and responsible use. Your entire argument is based off of the antecedent belief that mephedrone is so addictive that it cannot be used responsibly. However there has been no significant evidence to suggest that mephedrone cannot be used responsibly by most rational adults. As stated previously despite its incredibly widespread use 7 or 8 years ago, those who have developed dependency issues using mephedrone have been in the extreme minority.",null,0,null,1436347147,null,0,false,0,csw0ibb,null,t3_3cgl7u,null,t1_csw0ibb,null,t1_csw05x2,null,null,null,1437680936,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

you are right, but its the religious belief who tells them who to target

correct, they estimate that only 1 third of homophobic hate crimes are actually reported but is increasing, I wonder how many people are actually targeted. Sorry to hear about your situation, the police should be someone you can rely on.

My point is not that people shouldnt think these things or people wont do these things, its that when people react and criticise them, they are not brushed to the side as islamophobia, which is a fallacy for debate.

Like I said before, I think the issue is free schools. There's loads of them down south teaching ducking mental stuff and it repulsed me that your government has done that.

Yup so we've got this combination of traditional religious beliefs and disenfranchisement and it's potent. How are we going to fix that?

I'm obviously biased here because I'm a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a white man but it does shock me that we're all focused on te crimes by Muslims the police have ignored. I'm not sure that the polices issue is ignoring Muslims crimes, I think the problem is that they just ignore sex crimes most of the time. There's a deep seted sexism in te police force that allows these perpetrators away with what they do, and I'm worried that this is getting brushed to the side. I often see people on this sub wanting to talk about why so many of te perpetrators seem to be Muslims but if I mention that I want to talk about why so many of the perpetrators are men, that's unacceptable.

Wherever I live in Europe, I see immigrants along cues from local culture. In Belgium, street harassment is much more tolerated so I saw immigrants engaging in street harassment to a much huger degree than they do here.

In the UK, sex offenders rarely face justice and I think people coming into this country have seen that and taken advantage of it as locals hae for a long time.

Look, you are essentially going for what I like to refer to as...Shit jobs
Jobs that they would probably get monkeys to do if monkeys could speak english and didn't have a predesposition to flinging shit at moody customers.

When you are looking to hire people to these positions, the golden candidate is someone who. Has energy, has work ethic, Is outgoing, sociable/gets on well with others, team player.
You are also hoping that the person you hire is going to take their job seriously.

So I would change the opening statement. be a bit more upbeat in it, highlight your social skills. don't talk about retirement or your life plan, I don't care, and it makes you seem boring.

Also, You have written a LOT about being a fed, 
and here you need to tread carefully....and this might be whats fucking up your CV.....
the jobs you are going for...shit jobs.... your collegues will be taking drugs, probably your manager and his boss too.
How are you gonna re-asure your new boss that you will fit into the team, and not get funny because chloe sometimes has a spliff at lunch and does the afternoon a little stoned once a week... (because the boss probably knows and turns a blind eye as long as she is not taking the piss.... Because that keeps her happy hardworking...are you gonna rock that boat?)

Don't tell us what you did as a copper, we all know, we've all seen the bill and the news and documentaries etc.
Merge thames valley and met in one, and pretend shifting to the met was kinda a promotion (it was, you got paid more)

WHY did you join the police?
(answer is..help people, help comunity... drop in some skills...how you are really good at comunicating to people of all levels, and really good at conflict resolution, or explaining situations to people, and you wanted to do something that could put those skills to use to benefit your community...blah blah blah)
Why did you leave the police?
(answer... Because you got sick and tired of enforcing bullshit laws, like arresting teenagers for possesion...which you really didn't see as helping the community.... you saw that the met was focused more on the low level poverty related crime, but does very little if anything about the criminals who are wealthy and actually make a real negative impact on communities and society....

You also left because you did not like the fact that many of your collegues were generally cunty people who got into the job for all the wrong reasons, and clearly take pleasure in those moments when they get to be complete wankers to people.... (and if you didn't work with anyone from TSG, just say yousaw them in the canteen a lot :P )
because some coppers are cunts, and those people have fucked you, and you will need to reasure who ever you want to hire you...that you are NOT one of those cunt coppers..

In fact...if you left, because you were tired of your boss having a go at you for not hitting arrest targets, and didn't agree to doing what the other officers did which was find vulnerable poor people and arrest them for things like possesion...which meant that the atmosphere around collegues got a little bit strained etc....turns out when you went to the Met, the culture was very different, and you didn't agree with the way they did things...and didn't want to be part of something that ruins young peoples lives etc..so you left.

Then you have become someone of interest..
You took a job that required you to be amoral...but left because you have a good concience... and if that person is friendly, outgoing, etc.. I'd hire them.

I'm not talking about the drug laws, I'm talking specifically about the claim that the Conservatives are doing this 'because it's what the majority of the population want'.

If the majority of the country want strict drug laws (although I'd be interested in seeing those figures if you have them), that's arguably 'fine', but it isn't the point I'm concerned about. A more representative electoral system would force governments to act more proportionately, rather than simply claim 'majority mandate' in order to ram through whatever legislation they want.

UKIP aren't and won't focus on the creation of new industries in Wales, they're too focused on wealth creation and asset management in large urban centres. They'll also focus on scrapping the Barnett formula, and leaving Europe, both of which would absolutely beggar Wales. Wales gets far more money from England and the EU than it could ever raise through tax - even if it had the power to change taxation - which it doesn't.  

On top of that, UKIP would remove subsidies from a lot of industries that are some of the only ones left in Wales (for example Green Energy). 

If you live in the South of England, which has a developed and strong economy that could benefit from leaving the EU and focus on wealth creation in urban centres then voting UKIP makes sense (assuming you're extremely short-sighted and selfish). 

Not only this but let's not forget that UKIP has - at the very least - some very questionable policies (i.e being against gay marriage) as well as councillors that have said openly homophobic and racist remarks, as well as having several people suspended from the party for saying things that may not reflect party policy, but definitely belies the personal politics of the kind of people it attracts.

But it adds up though, doesn't it? Nowadays broadcast and computer technology are such that you can move country and still have access to the same films, TV programmes, music, books, sports, celebrities etc. that you had before. Logistics and globalisation is such that you can keep cooking and eating the same food and drink, and celebrate the same festival, events and customs that you did before.

With all of that, it's a lot harder for migrants to go to the effort of adopting something alien when they can retain all their home comforts.

But if they don't, then what do they interact about with people in the country they've moved to? Getting along and communicating requires *some* shared cultural understanding, but in today's world it's quite possible to move geographically without changing much culturally, and if there are enough other people from a similar culture, you may not even feel that cut off from society.

Throughout his career he has actively campaigned for equality and his political attitude towards social housing, living wages, renationalisation of the railways and no more foreign interventions are popular with the elctorate, even with more centre-tories, SNP and UKIP. 

I will agree the way he got into the contest wasn't the best, but he only chimed in a week before the leadership ended and in that week garnered a massive grassroots movement from supporters. No other candidate had it and if that sort of backing from the longest standing MP in the elections currently can't allow them to have a say then I believe the system needs to be better. You say candidates felt they had to break their own code, which shows the system is flawed.

If he were to get in today and then like you believe (which again I disagree), recieve a vote of no-confidence, it would destroy the Labour party who wouldn't even support a nominated leader. I doubt that would happen at all.

You say the left comes to destroy the party and so does the right. Well no, there is no real evidence to suggest that a significant number of right-wing folk are coming to take over the elections aside from the scaremongering #. I mean you argue for Liz Kendall and she is by far the most conservative apologist in the elections. And regarding the 'left' aspect - they are coming back to the party to evolve Labour not destroy it. I don't think you should feel the need to think 'your' party is under threat when it was founded as a party for the people and shall be moulded by popular movement. 

The trade unions can see the appeal and are all starting to back Corbyn, which actually might benefit Burnham as it will keep him out of the Tory union-bashing if Burnham gets elected.

I mean you want to stay with the current paradigm and continue New Labour and neoliberalism from what I can see, but look at the electoral votes since New Labour got into power. the proportion of people voting for Labour has continually dropped until Ed Miliband came along with an increase, and even then the massive majority missing to secure an electoral win were the poorest voters. The poorest demographics have been hit the worst by this government, and will be hit EVEN harder today and for the next five years. They will be searching for an alternative and is what UKIP and the SNP have been offering.

Ed unfortunately didn't offer a real alternative which is why he couldn't attract the voters, and in Scotland siding with the tories was their seppaku. If Corbyn was elected he would do better than the others at reclaiming the Scottish heartlands, and also voters who are disenfranchised with the current paradigm.

Balthazar - A Jewish scholar from Yemen, popularised in the Canonical gospels as an Eastern Magi although the name itself could be a miss-spelling of Belshazzar, a Babylonian Coregent Emperor  mentioned in the Nabonidus Chronicles and Qumran Scrolls. Belshazzar himself died after Babylon fell to the Persians in 539 BCE.  This is corroborated both in the Book of Daniel and the Qumran Scrolls as well as a historical romance called Cyropaedia which was written in the early 4th century BCE by Xenophon.

Coincidentally, its also the name of a great water front restaurant in Cape Town which serves the best Steak and wine in the whole of Africa.

In this case, a precedent would not be set because the caution was given by the police on the condition that further court action would be dropped and as far as I am aware only court decisions can set a legal precedent.

Now disregarding this fact, I am not a legal expert, so this might not be completely correct, but still - As I understand it when it comes to sentencing, precedent tends to take a backseat to sentencing guidelines and judicial discretion, because there are many aggravating and mitigating factors as well as other individual circumstances which prevent two cases ever being identical the majority of the time, so the system is designed to be flexible enough for the judge to consider each case individually without being hampered by strict guidelines. Another reason why putting forward such an argument may not work is that precedent is only binding on a court if it comes from a higher court in the heirarchy - say, a court of appeal, the supreme court, etc. So a case where a sentence was judged to be too harsh by a higher court of appeal would be accepted as precedent and taken into consideration during sentencing if the case before the court is sufficiently similiar, but a sentence handed down in an equivalent court may not - although it may still be taken into account. I think however that due to many sentences being decided largely based upon the individual circumstances of the case and the sentencing guidelines for many years now, it may practically have little effect on the outcome of the sentencing.

As long as we're in a union where you can locate in one member state and do business in another state and then transfer the profits via a ""royalty payment"", we won't collect a penny on this.

The only people who'll be forced to pay are small businesses. Which would put them at a disadvantage against larger businesses. Think a small independent coffee shop paying full corporation tax, competing against Starbucks paying dip-squat. The whole burden would fall on hairdressers, mechanics and so on, while big corporations (BMW, Google, Microsoft and so on) would pay nothing.

Notice also that NAFTA does not have this corporate tax shopping thing, which is why federal US corporate tax is 35% (and you are correct, when the state corporate tax is added it's 39% in total). Some American businesses have relocated to Mexico for the cheaper labour, but none to do corporate tax evasion because that's not allowed on the NAFTA rules.

This is why I think Labour has been asleep at the wheel over this whole EU re-negotiation and referendum thing. 

Instead of us saying ""we think everything in the EU is luverly"" and leaving it to Cameron to come up with his list of things to be renegotiated, we should have been out there saying ""This is a list of things *we* want changed in the EU"" and should have been pushing hard for it. Cameron will try to renegotiate social stuff, but he won't touch corporate tax because his donors would lynch him if he did.

How have we got into a situation where we are arguing against our own interests in the EU? Because some in the party do a knee-jerk ""if Farage is for it, we're against it, sight unseen"", instead of taking a hard look at the facts and looking at what is working and what is not.

P.S. See the following for how the tax evasion works in the EU:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement

&gt;Typically, the company arranges for the rights to exploit intellectual property outside the United States to be owned by an offshore company. This is achieved by entering into a cost sharing agreement between the US parent and the offshore company, written strictly in terms of US transfer pricing rules. The offshore company continues to receive all of the profits from exploitation of the rights outside the US, but without paying US tax on the profits unless and until they are remitted to the US.[6]

&gt;It is called double Irish because it requires two Irish companies to complete the structure. One of these companies is tax resident in a tax haven, such as the Cayman Islands or Bermuda. Irish tax law currently provides that a company is tax resident where its central management and control is located, not where it is incorporated, so that it is possible for the first Irish company not to be tax resident in Ireland. This company is the offshore entity which owns the valuable non US rights that are then licensed to a second Irish company (and this one is tax resident in Ireland) in return for substantial royalties or other fees. The second Irish company receives income from the use of the asset in countries outside the US, but its taxable profits are low because the royalties or fees paid to the first Irish company are tax-deductible expenses. The remaining profits are taxed at the Irish rate of 12.5%.

&gt;For companies whose ultimate ownership is located in the United States, the payments between the two related Irish companies might be non-tax-deferrable and subject to current taxation as Subpart F income under the Internal Revenue Service's Controlled Foreign Corporation regulations if the structure is not set up properly. This is avoided by organizing the second Irish company as a fully owned subsidiary of the first Irish company resident in the tax haven, and then making an entity classification election for the second Irish company to be disregarded as a separate entity from its owner, the first Irish company. The payments between the two Irish companies are then ignored for US tax purposes.[1]

&gt;Ireland does not levy withholding tax on certain receipts from European Union member States. Revenues from sales of the products shipped by the second Irish company (the second in the double Irish) are first booked by a shell company in the Netherlands, taking advantage of generous tax laws there. Overcoming[clarification needed] the Irish tax system, the remaining profits are transferred directly to Cayman Islands or Bermuda. This entire scheme is referred to as the ""Dutch sandwich"".[7][8] The Irish authorities never see the full revenues and hence cannot tax them, even at the low Irish corporate tax rates.

&gt;Jeremy's attitudes aren't outdated nor unpopular.

Corbyn supports nuclear disarmament and thinks Iran and North Korea should be allowed nuclear weapons. These are *wildly* unpopular positions. His views on nationalisation are also deeply outdated. There are valid criticisms to be made of capitalism and our current system and valid ways we could improve things, but nationalisation of everything is not among them, which is why no serious economist supports them any more.

&gt;No other candidate had [grassroots support]

All the candidates had plenty of grassroots support; they just didn't need it to get on the ballot.

&gt;If he were to get in today and then like you believe (which again I disagree), recieve a vote of no-confidence, it would destroy the Labour party who wouldn't even support a nominated leader.

The Labour Party wouldn't be *able* to support him as leader. He could not lead the party, because he does not have the support of the PLP, and so the party could not function.

&gt;You say the left comes to destroy the party and so does the right. Well no, there is no real evidence to suggest that a significant number of right-wing folk are coming to take over the elections

I didn't say it was a significant number, I said it was real, and that it was happening, even if only in small numbers. Some of his supporters, maybe only a very small number, but including people on the Executive Council of Unite, actually want to destroy the Labour Party. I think this is a problem. I think if you support someone who is also supported by people who want to destroy the Party, you need to seriously think about your support. 

&gt;I mean you argue for Liz Kendall and she is by far the most conservative apologist in the elections

Actually, I support Yvette. I just think Kendall has some good ideas, like increasing worker ownership of companies and trade union membership in the private sector (wow, how right wing!) and should be taken seriously.

&gt;conservative apologist

Or, actually, she just points out that we absolutely will not get elected if we are perceived as X, Y or Z and therefore we should not be perceived as X, Y or Z.

&gt;And regarding the 'left' aspect - they are coming back to the party to evolve Labour not destroy it.

No. See above. The Communist Party and the Socialist Workers Party actually want to destroy the party.

&gt;The poorest demographics have been hit the worst by this government, and will be hit EVEN harder today and for the next five years

I know, that's why we need to win, not to elect someone who cannot win.

&gt;They will be searching for an alternative and is what UKIP and the SNP have been offering.

&gt;Ed unfortunately didn't offer a real alternative which is why he couldn't attract the voter

This is the factual inaccuracy I was referring to. The SNP and Ukip were not wildly different from existing parties. Labour's manifesto was as different from the Tories as it has been in a long, long time. I'm not just saying this, either; this is based on what the IFS said about them before the election. The people had a 'real alternative' and decided to vote for the Tories in even greater numbers than previously, which shows you exactly what they thought of our 'real alternative'.

By the way, even if we had won every vote cast for the SNP, we still would've lost.

&gt;Scotland

More factual inaccuracies. What happened in Scotland is that it became apparent that 45% of the population supports nationalism, and there was one party that could easily sweep up that whole vote. It had nothing to do with being left-wing or siding with Tories, and by saying that it did, you're buying into the SNP's bullshit.

By the way, the SNP are the most evil, duplicitous bastards in UK politics at the moment. Frankly, the electorate's fear that we would go into coalition with them was justified, albeit not for the exact reasons people gave.

null,false,mastican42,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,null,"The whole point behind means tested grants is to encourage the poor the go to university in the first place. The middle class and rich are able to send their children to uni (and often, fund them as well) no matter what their level of intelligence or choice of course. The poor don't necessarily have that option, university is expensive and if the poor can get in with less debt at the end than the middle or rich then they are able to become more educate and elevate themselves out of poverty/low income.

The theory vs. what actually happens is always different. Invariably students don't all study academic courses with high chance of a good income, plenty study courses they will rarely use once they graduate and get a job that bares no resemblance to what they spent 3-4 years studying and occasionally people find that once they have a degree, suddenly that become overqualified for certain menial jobs which would otherwise supplement their income. However, the theory holds that there are a good number of students at uni who otherwise would not be able to afford it and either way, they've gained valuable experience and they are less likely to default back to the lifestyle they came from.

Take grants out the picture and now, the poor students are forced to loan all their money whereas middle income and high income students may not even have to take a loan in the first place and where they do, it will be less money than the poor will need to take out. Student loans have always been essentially a tax on the poor for this reason. A higher loan amount is repaid for longer over the course of the students life and therefore that individual has less disposable income (assuming the lack of a high income family to subsidise them), making them poorer. Supplementing some of their loan with a grant, aids in cutting the amount of loan they need to take.

As an example: A student from a 'poor' family earning less than say £12,000 per year goes to university, takes out the maximum in all student loans/grants because their parents have no spare cash to fund them. With a maximum grant at around £3,500 then that again in loan they only have to pay back £10,500 plus the £9000 per year tuition. With scrapped grants, that same student would have to pay back over £20,000 plus the £9,000 per year tuition loan. S/he leaves university with a degree which their parents never had and a good shot at a better paying job, even if it's only office work for example, it still pays higher than what their parents got paid. If they took out more loan, they pay more money back on the same wage. 

tl;dr Middle and high income families would be sending their kids to university anyway most likely and they will require less financial aid than poorer students. What happens after uni means you pay back what you took out but if you took out little to no money, you pay back little no money. You only pay back what you took. So your situation before you went to uni is what dictates your disposable income after assuming a the same income once you graduate. Grants mean less loan so the poor have to pay less back in the end. Removing grants punishes poorer families.",null,0,null,1436351418,null,0,1436351618,0,csw1jki,null,t3_3cj6ql,null,t1_csw1jki,null,t1_csw179p,null,null,null,1437681133,null,39,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,39,null

Unfortunately, the answer to your question is not very often. So far, we have just three confirmed televised games this season. Our first game V Wolves, on the 8th August; our derby against Bolton on the 28th August; and a game against Fulham on the 13th September. These will be on Sky Sports here, so you can almost certainly guarantee you'll get a stream somehow. I don't know why they are all so close together, but after that it's unlikely we'll be *officially* televised again unless we go on a cup run like last season.

Now, occasionally games somehow find themselves being streamed online, often without commentary. I don't know how this happens, but I'm guessing it's either a Betting stream or it's just a bloke with a camera who turns up and streams it by himself. However, I haven't found a lot of these streams for Rovers matches recently so maybe there has been a crackdown on them.

So my advice would be to check online every match, though, you're unlikely to find much. This is just one of many many reasons why we need to get back in to the premier league!

If the majority of the country want strict drug laws (although I'd be interested in seeing those figures if you have them), that's arguably 'fine', but it isn't the point I'm concerned about.

As soon as you start using phrases like 'majority of the country', you're talking electoral process and therefore inviting discussion around electoral reform. You can't talk about opinions whilst ignoring the validity of opinions.

&gt; I doubt it. As the saying goes: A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Just look at popular opinion on this subreddit vs scientific evidence for fracking, or the hysterical nature of discussions around TTIP for evidence of this.

I'm not going to go into detail about either of those things since we'd end up talking about them all day, but I will say that there are nuances to the debate around both fracking and TTIP / trade agreements in general, and that to simply dismiss the discussion as 'hysterical' misses the point. There are very valid arguments to be made, but it is easier to simply align yourself with one viewpoint and stick to it dogmatically. This is not an attack on you personally, by the way - I'm just trying to highlight that the fundamental problem is this tendency to view politics left vs right / black &amp; white. Fracking is a tool that we as a society *may use* if we *choose to*. The problem with our electoral system is that's it's usually all or nothing. There's no room for subtlety or nuance.

&gt; If anything, it's likely that foolish people who think they know a thing or two about drugs because of an article they read in the Daily Mail that have led to our insane drugs laws in the first place.

Ludicrous idea. Firstly most of the children will not understand a thing about computers let alone an actual circuit board. Most boys are too busy fighting and the girls are too busy with boys or drugs or both.

What parent will be able to assist with their child's toy? Sure - they got a circuit board with some components on it. But what about the other bits - a keyboard, a monitor... let alone the batteries! Give away? No, it's a get-this-free-you-must-buy-the-rest old gag.

From what I've street markets, world food fairs and getting the entire community to contribute to decorating any new community hub (like asking people to bring along ornaments and plants to add to a new park for example) works quite well. There are two things shared by every culture, even if they don't realise it: the desire to contribute something to the world around them, and food. Food often being oddly the biggest bonding experience - for whatever reason, even if people aren't chefs by trade, they love having the opportunity to share their personal cuisine with people around them. 

Radical preachers didn't win the hearts of minds of muslim communities by just standing on the streets yelling about how evil the west is and how they should support ISIS, no they first reeled people in with community projects, like charity events, helping to restore local parks, and organising community centres. Once they made people feel part of a community, was when they were able to penetrate the community with extremist ideas.

On the other extreme, this is also how Britain First works, they share facebook images and organise events that everyone can agree with and then sneak their ideology in.

This is a slight issue currently. We as a nation are funding students to study things they won't actually use. However it's difficult to deny the value of a university education. I studied Biomedical Science and I was from a poor background so obviously I needed to attend university in order to progress my career in the direction I wanted to go. *You can't go into science research without a degree in a relevant field*. It's that simple. 

However, there are plenty of students who study other degrees (I won't point fingers because that isn't fair and I'm probably biased anyway) that they will never use. The repetoire of transferable skills gained at uni is valuable but does one really need to attend university at great expense to get those? My opinion is no but that's just me. I feel like the transferable, non course specific skills I learned at uni could be gained in a 1-2 year college course at a vastly lower price.

However, who are we to deny someone a university education if they want it? It's obvious to say that all potential doctors must study medicine so it's only fair they are funded but where do cut off the artists? Or the novelists? Only the good ones? Who and what defines good?

Students don't pay back until they earn over £21k, repayments are small and it gets written off after 30 years. I'm never paying my loan back fully probably as I'm under no obligation under the t&amp;amp;amp;Cs. If the gov only get back half of my loan doesn't that create a problem for their balance sheet in the future?

It's like the government are using it to keep idiots who don't read the small print out of uni, while the rich who don't need loans and the people who understand the terms and conditions go. It's like an additional uni entrance exam. Am I right or do I just look like someone in a tin foil hat? 

Or worse yet will the gov just change the terms of the loans forcing graduates into a crisis of how they have to pay back the loan in the future?

Sorry mate. Perhaps you can help me understabd: why can't you or wont you understand the nuance?

I clearly mentioned cyclists goign through a red light at an empty pedestrian crossing.

Not a junction. Not a main road - a pedestrian crossing. So that means a straight road - and in this case one - as I described - with no pedestrians waiting to cross.

Can you imagine that situation? Can you imagine a situation - maybe not in London - but in another town, say Bristol, on a much smaller road, say, not during rush hour, and say, with hardly any traffic.

People will still shout at a bike for running a red light -  a red light that has served it's purpose for that moment.

I am flabbergasted - when people respond like.

I would say that multiculturalism is where migrants in a new community *blend* their existing culture with the new culture. That is where the real benefit and vibrancy comes from. It's the social equivalent to chicken tikka masala.

Sadly, in many cases it's cheaper to throw immigrants, and particularly asylum seekers who have little other choice, into the cheapest suburbs they can, which tend to already be struggling (hence being the cheapest). This puts further pressure on the existing communities and on the immigrants, and leads to ghettoisation.

That's why I said **most likely**. They have higher incomes so can more likely afford it than poorer families who almost explicitly can't. It doesn't count for much at all but I had friends at uni who came from richer backgrounds, they often said their parents paid for at least their accommodation or some combination of tuition fees and what not. I can't imagine this was a situation unique to my university and I didn't even attend one renowned for affluent students either.

&gt;On the other hand, by turning it into a loan, everyone is able to take advantage of this.

You're missing the point slightly. Poor families invariably can't afford it at all so grants benefit them massively. The current grants system has a sliding scale that means middle income families can also get grants if they need it. Making it a flat loan for all incomes or restricting the grants to only the poorest means you're meddling with a huge chunk of people who will be just missing cutoffs. The current system is blamed for being too simple and punishing middle income families, imagine if it gets simpler?

Like I said, the point of grants/loans university isn't to benefit everyone equally regardless of income. That is quite literally pointless, you're giving things to people who probably don't need it. The point is almost exclusively to get those into university who couldn't otherwise afford it.

In times of economic strife, people do not accept complex answers. In 1930 Germany, people didn't blame an unfair treaty signed at the end of WW I that pretty much crippled any German recovery. They blamed Jews. Why? Cause ""It's the Jews Fault"" is much easier to chant than ""It's a complex sociological and political issue and the fault lies in people far away"". 

It's the same in Greece. Things like this (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22198699) are common enough that I have had to rule out Greece from my Honeymoon plans. Sad, I wanted to go to Santorini. Yep. I know. Indian + Doctor Money = Still Not Going to Risk It. 

This is the same in the USA. When the great depression was on we saw massive lynch mobs target Asians, Mexicans and the Irish. Why? No fucking clue really. Honestly, everyone was shafted but it became EASIER to blame people who couldn't fight back rather than the people who were safe from criticism. 

AKA in the UK people blame ""Asians"".

Yet they are lumped in with the mainly poverty stricken Muslims who basically got shafted hard by de-industrialisation leaving them without the skills to pay any bills and with a major handicap in speaking English. It takes a while for a culture of education to be created so Muslims are only seeing their uni boom now.

How to lift a hammer was more useful in laying rail road tracks than Shakespeare. But the world changed and they didn't change as fast. Hell?

At the moment, it does mean that all the tickets have been allocated yes - however, the people that have season tickets are able to effectively sell individual match tickets back to the club if they don't want to go to that game, and these are then sold on members and as a general sale. 

This means that the amount of tickets that go on general sale is pretty variable, but for a team with no big rivalry like Swansea, and what is likely to be played on a Sunday/Monday evening (games played then are returned more often than Saturday ones), I would guess it is fairly likely that a decent number will go on general sale. Off the top of my head, I can't remember the official policy for when general sales take place, but its within 2/3 weeks of the match taking place, the date will be announced ahead of time, so you would have to check the page I linked above and see the status of the Swansea game for when it takes place.

&gt; more likely  
&gt; probably  
&gt; perhaps

Shedload of assumptions you've got going there, but there's little point arguing those really.

&gt;It doesn't count for much at all but I had friends at uni who came from richer backgrounds, they often said their parents paid for at least their accommodation or some combination of tuition fees and what not. I can't imagine this was a situation unique to my university and I didn't even attend one renowned for affluent students either. 

I could fire off with the opposite, saying that I knew people who's parents were rich who got little to no support from them and had to take up a job to support themselves, whilst I got by on my maintenance grants job free.

&gt; Making it a flat loan for all incomes or restricting the grants to only the poorest means you're meddling with a huge chunk of people who will be just missing cutoffs. The current system is blamed for being too simple and punishing middle income families, imagine if it gets simpler?

It's better off, because it doesn't punish middle income families? From the article the grant starts to fall from £30,000 earnings (not sure if pre or post tax), whilst the Institute for Financial Studies claims that [""a family with two children is now earning on average £31,000 after tax""](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11447587/Average-incomes-return-to-pre-recession-levels.html). Already the parents have to make up the gap from between £946 and £1,893 depending on how they calculate the cutoffs. That is a lot of money to be wanting parents to be able to provide. If both their children go to university, then that's double.

&gt; Everyone taking advantage of a system means that the ones who need it are afforded less advantage than they perhaps need.

But why do they need to be awarded this advantage? Should everyone not have equal opportunity to attend university? Why should an adult (a lot of starters will be 18, so legally an adult) be beholden to their parent's incomes for further education. Yes, there will be those who will have their way paid for them, but equally there will be those that suffered under the previous schemes and will now have a more equal ground.

I think employers are becoming more wise to that nowadays. It was certainly true 20-30 years ago but nowadays, I'm not so sure.

It was always more about academic excellence and demonstrations/applications of intelligence and critical thinking. So in that respect I feel like I can't comment too much. I do think it would be a good idea if there was a national drive to install transferable skills into the arsenal of young people through a college medium or something like that.

Injuries do happen over the course of a season and it's no secret that we always struggle massively in december and january when the fixtures are piling up and depth is running thin. 

We don't have the kind of funds to build that sort of depth either, you need to pay much higher wages to have quality players come be second choice for your club. 

The best we can hope for IMO is an EL place, and even that will become more difficult as other teams lower in the table are beginning to outspend us. 

IMO as long as the current board is in charge Everton will never win the PL, and furthermore I highly doubt we will ever make top four. ",null,0,null,1436355550,null,0,false,0,csw2q3t,null,t3_3c2ag0,null,t1_csw2q3t,null,t3_3c2ag0,null,null,null,1440492139,null,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1,null

null,false,Anandya,null,null,null,"I am British Indian. If you read the stats? Lower Crime Rate, Higher Education Rate, Higher Income, Higher Taxation and pretty much the model minority. 

Now here is the problem. We didn't integrate. I still have an Indian Name. I don't follow any Western Religion. I may enjoy Western Music but most of it isn't Music of White Origin. Even the rock gods of the Rolling Stones owe their origins to people like Sister Rosetta Tharpe. We still eat our food. Sure it may have adopted local ingredients like salmon but we aren't boiling the life out of vegetables or using Bisto in anything. 

We aren't regarded as a problem unless racists show up. We still put up with racism. I got told I speak with a foreign accent once. I speak with a Edinburgh accent. I sometimes slip into Mancunian. I was born in the UK, why would I speak like I was from India. Accents aren't genetic. 

And the thing is? Indians rarely adopt parent cultures. Why should we? Our culture is pretty rich and considering the centuries of being told it was the inferior culture of pagans and barbarians, we are finally seeing people being proud of things within it. Why should we give up our names and our faith and our ideas (Hell? I am an atheist from a Hindu background and even my atheism has its roots in people like Siddarth rather than Hitchens) when they are unique. We don't like the idea that we should be embarassed for being Indian when white people can do things we are shamed for with no problem. Do you know that in the UK most people who do yoga are white? Why? Because Indians were often shamed into being ""less Indian"". To fit in. Your kids and wife can wear a bindi or pottu as a fashion accessory. It's not for fashion. Hell? I was bullied at school for having Indian food. I used to tell my mum to stop making lunch for me. The same people who made fun of my food went to eat cheap rip offs on the Friday. When (finally) the real thing came to the UK, white people still take me to those places as if they discovered it first. 

And then we see Black people. As an Indian, you cannot convince me to integrate because black people did it and it wasn't enough. They picked White Names, changed their gods and left a huge part of who they are out to fit in. And they never did well. They still are treated as outsiders. No, I am afraid the metric of ""integration"" has more to do with how middle class your ethnicity is rather than what integration actually occurs. 

You aren't going to see any integration as long as you demonise people for issues that came about due to politics as if it were a personal failing of that ethnicity or group. 

And note, if my parents had integrated with the people around them. They would never have gone to Medical School. Neither would I. I was the only one in my neighbourhood to go to a Grammar School. I was the only one to go to Uni.

null,false,mastican42,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,null,"&gt; Shedload of assumptions you've got going there, but there's little point arguing those really.

Perhaps. Yes I assumed but I would be surprised if  actual values exist for that. I was simply applying my own common sense, if you disagree then that's fair enough. Like you say, no point in arguing.

&gt;I could fire off with the opposite, saying that I knew people who's parents were rich who got little to no support from them and had to take up a job to support themselves, whilst I got by on my maintenance grants job free.

Indeed you could, it's a valid point. But like I said before, the point of loans/grants is to incentivise an uneducated poor population to go to university when without the system, they'd never have a chance full stop. If your parents are rich and they aren't supporting your education you can't blame the system for that. You need to look closer to home. If your parents are rich enough to supply at least some support to you but they choose not to and burden the tax payer unnecessarily instead, how is that the fault of the system?

&gt;It's better off, because it doesn't punish middle income families?

Right. But now with this new system we're punishing the poor instead. We're cutting off the right hand to spite the left. Giving to one echelon and taking from another less likely to be able to pay. Yet on average, the middle class is likely to be more able to afford a better education without aid. Not everytime, but far, far more likely than the poor. Yeah sure that's an opinion but disagreeing with it simply because I don't have a source is disingenuous and missing the point entirely. The poor are poor for the very reason that they can't afford things. The middle incomes are middle income because they can afford more.

&gt;But why do they need to be awarded this advantage? Should everyone not have equal opportunity to attend university?

Everyone should be given an equal opportunity. But equal opportunity doesn't mean giving everyone in a line £5 and calling it done - all you've done is keep the gap exactly the same, nothing ha been achieved except you've devalued money because now everyone has more but the gap between richest and poorest is still the same. Equal opportunity is unbalancing the starting conditions to favour those in most need. Someone at the start of the line who already has £5 doesn't need more but someone at the end of the line who only has 50p needs £4.50. How they spend that money is up to them. But they've all been given the same starting conditions to begin with. This is the point of student loans/grants system. In a sprint race, everyone starts from the same line. The winner is who makes best use of the space between start and finish but they were all given the same starting conditions.

Think of it as a football match or a motor race. You are standing behind a wall with a mesh fence on top with your older brother and father. Your father is tall enough to see over the brick wall and mesh fence. Your older brother is just tall enough to see over the wall if he jumps but not the mesh fence so his vision is obscured but still he can see something. You on the other hand are too short to see over the wall at all.

Someone comes along with three boxes and gives one to each of you to stand on. Your father, already tall enough now has additional height he didn't need in the first place. Your brother is fine, he can see perfectly but you on the other hand now are barely able to see over the wall. You've all been given the same. But there is a noticeable problem. This isn't equality.

So, the person takes away the box from your father and gives it to you. Your father, still able to see is fine. Your brother with one box is now fine and you with your two boxes can now see over the wall and fence. Everyone has an equal opportunity, they were given what they needed to achieve it but that wasn't the same as giving the same to everyone and calling it done.

This is what the system is about.

Extra funds for HMRC to chase tax evaders. Strengthening of GAAR.

I think I heard him say £8Bn extra for the NHS too

edit: changes to vehicle excise duty - quite complicated, but basically there will be new taxes on brand new cars. New cars now have such low emissions that they avoid tax - which is actually regressive, since only rich people buy brand new cars.

Scrapping maintenance grants. Now replaced with loans on the same terms as student loans. No repayment until earning over £21K/yr. Also increasing the maximum size of grants.

Holy shit. Clamping down on buy-to-let mortgages. Cutting the tax exemptions for people offsetting mortgage interest against tax.

Inheritance tax threshold up to £1M. But not for people with houses worth £2M. Seems fair IMO.

Changing dividend tax too, so that company owners can't dodge so much income tax. I don't remember all, but he's adding 7.5% one threshold. Also cutting corporation tax to 19% then 18% in the future.

Welfare now. No cuts or taxes applied to disability benefits.

Free childcare for 3-4yr olds up to 30 hours a week.

ESA will be adjusted to JSA rates for new applicant. No effect on existing claiming. I'm not sure about this one.

Changes to tax credits, so that they no longer subsidise businesses paying low wages. Tax credits will freeze for 4 years. Disability excluded from the freeze. 

Rents in social housing sectors cut by 1% per year for the next 4 years.

Halving the allowance when you can claim tax credits. I don't understand this one.

Benefits cap being reduced from £26,000 down to £23,000 in London and £20,000 outside London.

Those on higher incomes (&gt;£40K London, &gt;£30K elsewhere) in social housing will pay market rates.

Tax credits limited to 2 children. Same for housing benefits. With provisions for multiple births. No families see a cash loss.

Tax free allowance going up to £11,000 (final target is £12,500). Will rise in line with minimum wage. Raising 40% threshold to £43,000 (final target is £50,000).

Yes it was harder in terms of work given, difficulty and standard. I noticed that they seem to mark more harshly, so the level of effort that got you a 1st in 1st/2nd year won't cut it anymore. 

But for what it's worth it's absolutely nothing like the jump between GCSE and A level in terms of difficulty. The first two years are supposed to build you up to this point, and while it is more difficult you should be perfectly well equipped. Frankly I didn't think it was as hard as others have told me in the past though. Even the dissertation isn't hard in terms of work, it's more of a keeping the passion for the subject going over an entire year...

I actually found second year more of a struggle. Less freedom in terms of what I was studying, similar workload but a whole lot less passion for the subjects I was studying.

You'll be fine, don't worry about it too much.

As a consequence of the sectoral balances equation, attempting to cut the deficit means that it is harder for the private sector to net save and accumulate financial assets (in this case government bonds).  However the private sector *wants* to net save because leading into the financial crisis it was heavily indebted, and needed to improve its balance sheet (you can see this in the sectoral balances chart [here](http://www.3spoken.co.uk/2015/06/uk-sectoral-balances-q1-2015.html).  The government tried to counter this a few years ago with the first austerity drive, and it nearly tanked the economy again.  This is because running a government surplus with an entrenched trade deficit is stupid, as it forces the private sector to draw down savings and go into debt.  They're now trying it again, and the OBR have made some quite frankly [worrying](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-F9ybV_8Xcgw/VQ2jpI0_azI/AAAAAAAABNM/V1pdWlnHQKA/s1600/UK%2Bhousehold%2Bdebt%2Bto%2Bincome%2BOBR%2BMar%2B15.jpg) charts about what they think household debt would end up doing.

A report by the Economist found as technology develops, however, it seems increasingly likely that the 20th-century construct of people trooping across a city to sit next to each other simply to do their job will come increasingly under question, as more flexible approaches emerge. As such, eight in ten executives agree that the working environment will become “virtual” thanks to more secure mobile technologies and cloud computing. The workforce will become decentralised  and full of freelance contractors, employees will accessible to companies in any location in a hyper connected world  

 In 2013, 67 per cent of employees worldwide were working in more actively collaborative ways, while 57 per cent reported an increase in their number of coworkers who work from different geographical locations. Jobs and organisations are becoming increasingly flexible in response to the shift towards a 24 hour society. 50 per cent of businesses say that flexible working (including flexible hours and offsite working) is now standard practice.



The credo of the politician today is: “Why are you not hiring more people here?” The credo of the C.E.O. today is: “You only hire someone — anywhere — if you absolutely have to,” if a smarter machine, robot or computer program is not available. Yes, this is a simplification, but the trend is accurate. The trend is that for more and more jobs, average is over. Thanks to the merger of, and advances in, globalization and the information technology revolution, every boss now has cheaper, easier access to more above-average software, automation, robotics, cheap labor and cheap genius than ever before. So just doing a job in an average way will not return an average lifestyle any longer. - Thomas L. Friedman

""There is a global race for STEM skills and other countries are heavily investing and increasing the supply of STEM students, 41% of all degrees awarded by Chinese institutions in 2011 were in a STEM subject, almost twice the proportion of STEM degrees awarded in the UK and three times the rate in the US. China now stands behind only the United States in the number of science and technology journals published annually, and is expected to overtake the US in scientific output within few years, according to a recent study by the Royal Society. By 2020, China expects to have nearly 195 million community college and university graduates — compared with no more than 120 million in the United States. Accenture predicts that Brazil will increase its engineering graduates by 68% by 2015 and will produce more PhD engineers than the US by 2016."" 

Thomas Friedman on the Globalization of Higher Education - ""In the past, workers with average skills, doing an average job, could earn an average lifestyle. But, today, average is officially over. Being average just won’t earn you what it used to. It can’t when so many more employers have so much more access to so much more above average cheap foreign labor, cheap robotics, cheap software, cheap automation and cheap genius. Therefore, everyone needs to find their extra — their unique value contribution that makes them stand out in whatever is their field of employment. Average is over.""

Free university only worked when a fraction of the population went to university and the rest either went straight to work, into apprenticeships, or onto 1-2 year vocational courses.

Increasing the number of university places by an order of magnitude either requires tax hikes, public spending cuts elsewhere or for the students to make a contribution (whether direct or via a loan).

I didn't explain myself very well...I was talking about over the 30 years, not strict monthly payments. So the net effect over time will be harsher on the person who borrowed more. Sounds fair enough until you realise that the person who borrowed more did so because they couldn't afford to borrow less. The person who borrowed less already had money to begin with so it's essentially punishing the people who need to borrow more by charging them loan repayments for longer. The folk who borrow less, pay back less and get more disposable income for longer - increasing their wealth disproportionately.

You pay back 9% of the difference between your earnings and the cutoff yes but if you borrowed half what someone else borrowed, you are burdened less. The individual who borrowed half (on the assumed account that they were subsidised by their family) will pay be paying for a shorter amount of time thus lessening the burden. Over 30 years, they have paid on average, less per month. 

**EDIT**: To clarify, both pay back £5 per month for example. But Person A who borrowed more will be paying that for longer, lessening their disposable income for 30 years. Person B who borrowed less will be paying the money for a shorter amount of time, meaning he has more disposable income once he's finished paying.",null,0,null,1436357976,null,0,1436432445,0,csw3k9j,null,t3_3cj6ql,null,t1_csw3k9j,null,t1_csw38vd,null,null,null,1437681737,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

I see no reason whatsoever for his agent to leak that, so surely it was the club to make everyone look at Sterling as a money whore - and it worked, do you remember the games after that? every time Sterling did something bad there'd always be comments about ""LOL £150K"" and his twitter was bombed with it.

I agree no player should run off to the media and cry, but I also think that contract negotiations should never be leaked by the club.

I doubt Sterling even wanted to leave the club back in January, he just wanted to play and get a new contract.. but his agent was in his ear about £150k and then the club leaked it giving Sterling a bad name which made him want to leave the club.

Rodgers gave him his debut, showed patience after his average first year, let him flourish in the title run, and asked him to play a key role in the team this year (which includes playing in positions other than his most preferred role, something nearly all elite players have to do at some point to develop). Not to mention giving him a holiday in January, which would have backfired massively on Rodgers had we lost the game Sterling was missing for.

I'd even be more understanding if he'd achieved anything. People have already mentioned Agger commenting on Rodgers, at least he'd been a top quality player for us for years, forming part of our best team under Rafa challenging for the title. Or even when the likes of Keane had issues with Ferguson, or Ramos and Casillas with Mourinho, they'd all achieved things which gave them a bit of credibility. Sterling has done fuck all. I'd take Suarez' praise of Rodgers over any criticism from Sterling as a judgement of Brendan as a manager.

Whatever the issue he has with Rodgers is, Sterling and his agent should have kept it between themselves and the club. That's how professionals act. Because all this is is a PR move to try and make out that Rodgers is the problem, not Sterling's terrible attitude and greed.

null,false,Firefox7275,null,null,null,"There is no evidence that eye creams are necessary, it is just skin at the end of the day and can benefit from most of the same anti ageing actives that the rest of your face/ neck/ decollete can. Most eye creams are just teeny tiny tubes of expensive moisturiser.

After broad spectrum sunscreen (and sunglasses) the 'holy trinity' of anti ageing actives is arguably a retinoid, vitamin C and niacinamide. These are all covered in our ingredients Wiki and mega reviews (see sidebar). Anti ageing is a long slow process, expect results over months rather than weeks.

For dark circles that are related to lifestyle do what you can to adjust that: clean up and balance out your diet (meet or exceed ALL the guidelines), be physically active (at least 10,000 steps every day), practice stress management, minimise alcohol and caffeine so the sleep you do get is restful/ high quality. Healthy living/ antioxidant rich diet also supports skin (anti) ageing.

Actives that published research suggests may be effective on dark circles include [vitamin K] (http://skinactives.websitetoolbox.com/post/vitamin-k-2052672) and [chrysin,] (http://stores.skinessentialactives.com/chrysin-98-5-grams-9-85/) and these also have anti ageing properties. Unfortunately I don't know of any UK product that includes both of these. Options include

- [Active Formulas] (http://www.activeformulas.com/products/bright-i-eye-cream) or [Skin Actives] (http://www.skinactives.com/Bright-I-Cream.html) Bright-I Cream. I don't know what the percentage of chrysin is tho, you might e-mail Skin Actives to ask because they have been forthcoming in the past. You cannot easily add vitamin K to the UK one because it looks to be an airless pump bottle.

- Una Brennan Superfacialist [Vitamin C+ Dark Circles Eye Cream] (http://www.boots.com/en/Superfacialist-Vitamin-C-Dark-Circles-Eye-Cream-15ml_1361782/) The vitamin C and the chrysin are way down the ingredients list so may not be much present. Reviews are decent tho.

- [SEA Chrysalis eye serum DIY recipe] (http://skinessentialactives.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/chrysalis-eye-serum.html). Skin Actives (US), Skin Essential Actives (US citizen in China) and Actives Formulas (UK) all sell the key active ingredients. /r/DIYbeauty/ can help you simplify a recipe.

- [Fawnie Skincare eye serum.] (http://www.myfawnie.bigcartel.com/product/fawnie-firming-and-lightening-eye-serum) Her products are handmade for each customer, LOVELY to use,  and always use the percentages backed by published research. But not exactly cheap when you factor in shipping and possible customs (Fawnie may be able to help with that, I 'know' her virtually from skincare forums).

- Korean high end brand [su:m37 Flawless Regenerating eye cream.] (http://asianskincareblog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/sum37-flawless-regenerating-eye-cream.html) The full size product is eye-wateringly (ha ha) expensive, but there are packs of ten samples for cheap on eBay.

Whilst it is generally considered regressive, it's an edge case as it depends strongly on spending habits.

And it's why there are exemptions on essentials.

Someone only buying essentials will pay no VAT. Someone buying essentials plus a new telly will pay VAT on the telly.

It's considered regressive because the well off tend to save more.
If you're spending all your income on stuff (a mix of VAT and VAT-free products), then you will pay a higher proportion of tax on your income than someone who is saving their money (and thus not being charged VAT).

But those people who are saving - they'll spend those savings one day on something, and they'll get stung then (whether that's VAT, Stamp Duty, etc).

If I save £40k and you spend £40k, then you will be taxed and I won't. But sooner or later I'll probably want to do something with those savings, and I'll most likely get stung at that point.

So, simply comparing someone's annual income vs annual taxation isn't entirely fair, because you get deferred spending and other such complexities.

It's not heavily regressive like a tax cap of £1m or something where you're considered to have paid your fair share once your tax bill hits £1m and everything after that is tax-free, or fuel excise duty (since demand for petrol is fairly inelastic - people pay what they have to in order to get where they're going).

I wanted to support a large number of merchants in Cambridge but after hours walking the streets and trying to convince people that accepting Bitcoin is good for them, I only managed to convince the butcher. I also want to support the Bitcoin economy, that's why I did this. Having only one merchant, I check the status of this quite infrequently. 

Where did you have to travel in from? How much did you want to spend? Did you end up paying with cash or card? I can see why he was hesitant. My fault, not his. I'll give him a call and ask him about this.

I'm setting up a weekly reminder so that this never happens again. I initially wanted to clear these payments daily, but with just one merchant this is too time consuming.

Cheers
Daniel

Currently dividends are paid with a notional basic rate tax credit of 10%. 

A company pays a dividend of £10,000, say, from its balance sheet, and £10,000 is received by the investor, but for tax purposes the company is deemed to have paid £11,111.

If the recipient is a non-taxpayer (or an ISA/pension) this credit can't be reclaimed.

If the recipient is a basic rate taxpayer, there is no further tax to pay.

If the recipient is a Higher rate or additional taxpayer, an additional 22.5/27.5% is payable, based on the notional gross figure.

~~It looks like this 0%/22.5%/27.5% regime is being replaced with a 7.5%/32.5%/38.1% regime, but with the actual dividend paid being the gross amount used (making the current system effectively 10%/32.5%/37.5%), and a £5,000 dividend-specific tax-free allowance being included.~~

The presumption that people can just walk into jobs. As if every town has a surplus of jobs that young people are just refusing to fill. The Apprenticeship scheme may take care of some of the learning aspect, but it doesn't pay well and young people will still need financial support on it.

The Guardian says that:

From wiki ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass_Eye ):

""In the opening scene of the second episode, ""Drugs"", a voiceover tells viewers that there are so many drugs on the streets of Britain that ""not even the dealers know them all"". An undercover reporter (Morris) asks a purportedly real-life drug dealer in London for various fictitious drugs, including ""Triple-sod"", ""Yellow Bentines"" and ""Clarky Cat"", leaving the dealer puzzled and increasingly irritated until he tells the reporter to leave. He also explained that possession of drugs without physical contact and the exchange of drugs through a mandrill were perfectly legal in English law. David Amess, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Basildon, was fooled into filming an elaborate video warning against the dangers of a fictional Eastern European drug called Cake, and went as far as to ask a question about it in Parliament.[1] The drug purportedly affected an area of the brain called ""Shatner's Bassoon"" (altering your perception of time), can give you a bloated neck due to ""massive water retention"" and was frequently referred to as ""a made-up drug"". Other celebrities such as Sir Bernard Ingham, Noel Edmonds, and Rolf Harris were shown holding the bright-yellow cake-sized pill as they talked, with Bernard Manning telling viewers that ""One kiddy on Cake cried all the water out of his body.

Turns out Liverpool was owned by the same guy that owned my favorite team of all time, the Texas Rangers. Little did I know at the time he was a shite owner, but I at least saw it as a connection that was meant to be.
I started following the team, waking up for games early on the weekends and eventually found myself obsessed.
When Torres put in his transfer request, I was devastated. I had to ""choose"" a side. This tested my true fandom, if I found myself cheering for him then I wasn't an LFC supporter, but a Torres supporter instead.

&gt; Before 1 July 2006 a child could only obtain citizenship through his or her father if the parents were married.

I've seen online that people have sort of twisted the bit at the end ""according to law"" to mean that you're not really swearing allegiance to the Queen, just to the system of government as it exists today, and pledging not to reform it by violent means. I'd be happy to pledge that - I don't want a violent revolution! But I honestly don't think that's a correct interpretation. I think the oath is asking people to swear they support the monarchy. I think it's bizarre, because millions of natural-born British citizens are republicans, and being republican is not exactly a wacky point of view. And I just don't want to do it.

Incidentally, MPs have to swear something much the same.

I work at a University and I know lots of students who are not getting grants who supplement their maintenance loan with paid work in term time and holidays. Students on grants are less likely to need to  work because they're able to borrow/receive more money.

* No Jeremy does not support North Korea or Iran and even said less than 6 weeks ago how it is a worry North Korea is arming itself. Personally Iran is a overwhelmingly defensive state and if you believe in nuclear deterrants then it could provide some more stability to the region (which is personal opinion)

* The public don't fully support Jeremy with disarmament, but the majority do support *either* no renewing trident (around 24%) or renewing trident with a smaller cost fleet and less weapons (around 36% IIRC with these percentages).

* Nationalising of the railways has it's pros and cons, and the public want them nationalised and he is the only candidate that supports that (over 60%). 

* Yes they would suport him as it would destroy Labour if the electorate voted him in and then they voted him out. They would find a middle ground between his views and theirs.

* You implied that people were from the left and right actively trying to destroy Labour but the way you phrased it indicated that it was not a small number.

* You misunderstood me with Liz. I didn't think you were voting for her but that you were defending her against people hating on her, whilst you do that with Jeremy. I do believe that she has Labour values and has some good policies that she wants to introduce, but she is the furthest right in the leadership campaign whilst the others occupy the centre (apart from Jeremy) and my opinion is that if she comes 4th or even behind Jeremy then it indicates that Labours position should be further to the left. 

* no it is not a factual innacuracy. With UKIP a lot of votes are disenfranchised voters who seek an alternative, and in times of economic hardship nationalistic parties rise. UKIP has some progressive policies amidst the crud and even if they do not differ from the equilibrium, it is the fact that they are an *alternative vote*. SNP was due to the fanning of nationalism by the government, labours apathy in scotland and working with the conservatives, and socialist policies. That is what caused the massive rise of the SNP, not just nationalism like you indicate. It was a multitude of factors and pinning it on solely nationalism is more naive than 'buying into the SNP'. People who voted No also voted SNP in the election. 

* Ed miliband stated he was the only labour leader to say that he would continue cutting public spending, and gave *no real alternative to asuterity*. This is the point I am making. Across Europe anti-austerity movements are becoming massive and when it is offered (like SNP) it is popular. This is where Ed went wrong, no *clear alternative* advertised.

* Conservatives mainly rose due to liberal democrats being destroyed and the majority of conservative gains were in seats where liberal democrats were 1st and conservatives second e.g. Cornwall and the South.

* Your hate for the SNP is way above any sort of wild innaccuracies and speculation you claim I have, so I would like you to provide some actual evidence how you can claim them to be so terrible. Yes they want independance but they are not as terrible as you imply.

1) Edinburgh is, I would say, a slightly better city than Cardiff in many ways. More to see and do, much prettier. That's not to say Cardiff is bad at all- quite the contrary, it's a very friendly and easy city and I love living there. Better nightlife too if that matters to you. 

Also worth noting that the HW campus is a ways out of the city centre, so you'd be taking a lot of buses if you want to experience Edinburgh properly. Cardiff uni is central and entirely walkable. 

2) Cardiff is *much* cheaper, especially when it comes to rent. Seriously half the cost; Edinburgh is beaten only by London when it comes to the 'expensive city' stakes. 

3) How important is reputation/prestige to you? I don't know anything about your specific course, but overall Cardiff is considered a better university than HW and the Russell Group status may matter to you even if it's irrelevant to your actual education. HW justifiably or not suffers from the unfortunate 'second fiddle' label next to the more famous Edinburgh Uni, similar to Oxford Brookes next to Oxford or indeed Cardiff Metropolitan next to Cardiff. How much of an impact the prestige gap would have on your future employment prospects I have no idea. 

I would pick Cardiff based solely on what I know, but my information is incomplete as I've never studied at HW and I'm not an urban planner.

Art is very high in supply and very low in demand. As such, most people are not able to make use of the degree that well and will earn less. And as such a lot of people will not pay back more than they have borrowed.


So the money I pay back extra is used to fill the gaps where money has not been repaid.

Silence, and then the next reason is not money or trophies, but that he doesn't want to work with Rodgers, not that he doesn't want to play for Liverpool. 

They're all excuses made by Ward in order to move his client so he can collect some easy money. Now he's offering Sterling 50% of that to definitely get him to move (who knows, maybe contract talks with us were actually getting somewhere?). 

I'm not saying that Sterling is entirely blameless (he's not) but it's definitely a case of him being led by his agent rather than desperately wanting out himself. And to those saying who are still unconvinced? Look at how similar this is to the Berahino problems last year -- almost identical.

--------

Here is more about how the new national living wage (NLW) will work.

 * The NLW will be a new premium on top of the minimum wage, starting at £7.20 when it comes in in April next year. That is 70p higher than the minimum wage now, or 50p above the rate that will come in in October.

 * The NLW will only apply to workers over 25. Effectively, it is just a new national minimum wage rate for the over-25. 
The government will give the Low Pay Commission a new remit, so that it recommends increases in the NLW, as well as the minimum wage, and the government will ask it to ensure that the NLW reaches 60% of median earnings by 2020. That would take it to over £9.


 * The Treasury says that 2.7m people will receive a pay rise as a direct result, and that 3.25m in total could get an increase when you take into account the knock-on effect on other workers. It says that by 2020 someone working 35 hours a week previously on the minimum wage will have seen their gross pay rise by a third, or £5,200 a year, compared to 2015.

 * The Treasury says that the idea for the NLW pegged at 60% of median earnings was taken from a report by Professor Sir George Bain for the (left-leaning) Resolution Foundation thinktank.

Incidentally? She's the same race as me. Tamil. 

There are Zimbabweans who are my skin colour. The term is used to reference British Black people who are generally from the Carribean or are from ex-Colonies like Nigeria and Zimbabwe where the adoption of British ""Culture"" was a lot more thorough. 

And I am afraid we are quite happy to categorise all Asians and indeed All Muslims under a single group. Now you are pulling up a double standard? I repeat. Black people in the UK have the same sociological problem. They were also working class industrial workers from the fag end of the UK's industrial era. When the heavy goods manufacture of the UK closed down they were out of jobs. Hence similar problems of crime and poverty. 

If you are capable of the nuance of telling the difference between different Black people then surely you can tell the difference between a Sardar from Punjab and an Iyyer from Chennai? Or did you think India was a country without diversity too? Incidentally? There are Indians in places like Jamaica and Fiji too. I get your argument, it's just that it's the same argument that I have used time and time again that no one would listen to. 

The point is we are discussing Black People in the UK who are one off the most integrated groups within the nation and who still suffer institutional bias and deprivation despite doing so.

I had lots of friends from the countries I lived in, and learned as much as I could about the culture, getting involved as much as possible, but you are still an outsider. Sometimes you feel like a novelty, or like a child that has to have everything explained. So you are friends with other expats too, with whom you speak only English, eat food you are used to, and talk about the cultural reference points you all are happy with. 

Then you move back to the UK and realise that most people who hate immigrants do so for the exact same traits that you exemplified when you were abroad. You find that most people aren't genuinely interested in other cultures or in moving abroad. You end up with two perspectives, and insights into lots of different cultures, but your original identity is eroded somehow. Not diluted, but just a bit faded because of the more recent vivid experiences you have had in another country.

I've felt a little disconnected ever since coming back to the UK after a few years in various different countries, and sympathise heavily with people. I latch onto the contact I can get with other cultures - I loved learning about Islam when I lived in Egypt and take the chance to learn more from Muslims at work and outside. I walk up to Dutch and French people when I hear them speaking their language to have a chat about where I lived and exercise my limited language in both. That's a bit weird I suppose. 

I feel sorry for people who have no understanding or interest in other cultures. But then, they are also lucky in a way to feel so set into one singular culture, certain in their knowledge of where they belong.

http://missionsharingknowledge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Sonia-Gandhi_18.jpg

She's Sonia Gandhi. 

Used to be Edvige Antonia Albina Màino. An Italian. She changed her Surname when she married into the Nehru family and adopted the Surname Gandhi. She was very close to becoming the actual Prime Minister of India. See? India is made up of different cultures. She's arguably one of the most powerful people in the world and THE most powerful woman in India. 

I take pride in the fact my family had made it through the Indian Education System and this drove them to demand excellence from their children. In order to survive they got smart. They had to study in horrific conditions. Remember that 40C Wimbledon 
match? My mum's done 12 hours of surgery in those conditions. 

Education is the Asian Rap Music. Growing up our heroes were not just the usual musicians and sportsmen but also doctors and engineers. 

If it wasn't for the fact my family refused to adopt the local custom of letting kids do ""what they want"" I would probably have not gotten all that much education. All my friends growing up were not that well educated or driven to education. To get a Mega Drive I had to ""earn"" it. Other kids got it for Christmas. Other kids rarely read, my parents would actively take time out from work (as doctors mind you) to go to the Library. Whatever I wanted if it was to do with education I got. My peers did not. They got luxuries. I got things that were important for an education. As a child I did not understand why my family once spent 9 months without a TV while they didn't care about the cost of an actual encyclopedia (moore pricey than a TV) or a microscope. 

My cousin's family ""integrated"". He doesn't speak a single Asian Language. Goes by a shortened form of his first name and doesn't eat anything ""Indian"". He spent most of his life struggling for a job. His older brother was given a more traditional upbringing. Lawyer and Millionaire. 

Now, I am not rich. In fact charity pays poorly but I got to do what I wanted to do. My parents exposed me to a life of Medicine and a drive to excel that others did not have. 

So to say that Indian culture played no role in my upbringing is foolish. Being a mix of both cultures allowed us to take in the best of both. I don't have the sexism problem of Indian Culture. I am more independent and adventurous due to the British influences on my life. However I am much more prudent due to my Indian upbringing. 

I am far less isolated than you think. I don't simply ditch my Indian culture simply because there is another around that others follow. 

And yeah I Indulged in the traditional passtimes of inner city youth. Weed, Alcohol and hell? I was a bit partial to LSD when I was younger. However the difference between me and the people I grew up around was that I did those things on Friday/Saturday. And I did them after I had done reading and never when I had work. That's the difference. My parents culture taught me enough about doing the damn job to do it properly then relax. 

And you don't seem to understand what I meant. Segregation? It just meant I got to go out to play at 6 PM not at 4 PM. It meant I couldn't go to my friend's place on a week night to play Mortal Kombat. It meant that i didn't eat meat growing up because my old religion expected me to be veggie. It didn't mean you didn't talk to white people. It just meant you didn't do things just like everyone else around you if you saw that something was clearly dumb.

You clearly don't understand what that means.

 No. That's not even slightly what I'm saying. That isn't even partially related to what I'm saying.

Normally I'd start arguing at this point - but it's clear you have a profound inability to understand information put to you.

Right. OK - obvious troll.

&gt; Bottom line: laws are not optional. They are not supposed to be flexible. That's why they are called 'laws' and not 'suggestions' or 'guidelines'.

Notwithstanding there are entire groups of people dedicated to understanding and interpreting law (literal law, golden rule, letter of the law, spirit of the law. etc) - the fact is laws are broad and difficult to write and they don't apply to every situation equally.

If you're at a junction in the middle of the night and you can see for miles all round - but the ""law"" says you have to stop at a red light. Fine. Except that red light is controlled by a timer, and it's purpose is to keep you safe and avoid collisions.

including any implied conditions, warranties or other terms as

So unless you can prove something illegal has happened, then they are absolved of most liability.

Your claim for wasted time/productivity is set aside by 22.3:

(including negligence) or otherwise for:

&gt; i. any loss (whether direct or indirect) of profit,
business, contract, use, anticipated saving or
revenue, goodwill, production, business interruption,
wasted expenditure

22.6 then covers their right to contact you:

&gt; The Customer agrees to EE and/or its service
providers keeping it and its Users informed about EE, EE
Group and third party products, services and offers.

So unless you can prove something illegal happened I don't think you have any grounds for a civil suit.

The reasons you gave are you are ""propping up"" people who made ""bad decisions"" who are going to get a ""decent"" job because they arent ""employable"" due to ""supply and demand"". Is teaching not deemed a neccessary, decent job anymore? Have I made a bad decision? I can easily get the job afterwards because there is more demand than supply, I wont however have my pay increased because of this demand, im stuck at 33k. To me it doesnt matter because money is not a priority to me. 

 Honestly if you manage to pay back all of the money you owe, you are very lucky. Many people wont get the chance to earn anywhere near enough to pay it all back, and subsequently wont earn a lot of a money in thier lifetime. I understand your frustration at the system, however I do not understand you attacking the arts students. They choose thier degree at 17. If you disagree with the system then take it up with the people who make the system not the young people who are forced to use it. Do I think the system is entirely fair, of course not. Do I think it the students fault? No, I dont. If I left with 9k debt like it used to be and pay it all I would rather, but alas no I owe 27k that I cant even afford to pay. But if I wanted to teacher then I had to bite the bullet.

This is why quite often a range is given with how much banks will lend (e.g. 3 to 5 times salary maximum). Someone with a lot of financial obligations or bad financial habits will be at the lower end, whereas someone more frugal who is capable of saving a lot will be able to borrow more because they are more confident you can make the repayments.

Assuming a £25k salary you might not have an issue borrowing up to £75k - but borrowing £125k would require a serious show of being able to afford it. As you start getting towards the limits of what a bank might lend you it becomes more important.

Like I said there there is also some distinction between discretionary spending (which the bank will assume you would cut back if you had to) and mandatory spending (which you wouldn't be able to cut back). It might also be worth having a look at what value property you want.

 Barcelona is the club he dreamt of playing for as a child and where his girlfriend's family lives. He gave us absolutely everything, 110% while he was here.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
CEOP thematic assessment

Breaking down the barriers to understanding child sexual exploitation

http://ceop.police.uk/Documents/ceopdocs/ceop_thematic_assessment_executive_summary.pdf

&gt;For groups one and two 
combined, the ethnicity of 38% of the offenders was unknown, 30% were white, 28% asian, 3% Black and 0.16% Chinese.

Now let me remind you that white people are currently 87% of our population and Asians are around about 7%. Comparing these numbers to the child explotation percentage based on race clearly shows that asians perform an extraordinary amount of child sexual explotation, when compared to whites they are almost on par even when there's a whopping 80% difference in population.

There's clearly a problem here with the asian community, this needs to be addressed. ",null,0,null,1436366034,null,0,false,0,csw7ezb,null,t3_3cit2x,null,t1_csw7ezb,null,t1_csw1ulh,null,null,null,1437684711,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

You pay back 9% of your salary above £17,335. So, if you're from a poor background and took out all the loans and are now earning £25k a year, you pay £689.85/year. 

Conversely, if you're from a rich background and took out one of the loans and are now earning £25k a year, you pay £689.85/year. You pay the same. 

If both hypothetical people carried on for 30 years like this, at £25k the rich person may have paid off all their one loan, just about, the poor person will have anything left at this point written off completely, with no penalty. So they have maybe 50-80% of their loan just forgotten about in good faith.

I'm excited to have signed a player with such a history despite being so young, but I am just not feeling how many defenders we have and how much wages they're taking up. Players who *could* play 1st team defense now include: Walker, Trippier, Yedline, Vert, Alder, Kaboul, Chiriches, Dier, Wimmer, Rose, Davies, plus the youth players we currently have that I don't even know their names. 

Now, depth is great, in that we have 3+ players who can truly play any defensive position, but if not for injuries, Poch really wouldn't have changed the defense too frequently (even when we had mid week games IIRC). 

Basically, I'm torn between us having a defense last year that cost us a lot of goals, and buying 3 new players this summer who *could* be starting defenders this season. And with those 3 new signings, if we don't sell/put out on loan a few other defenders, from a financial perspective, we're wasting a lot of money on players who wouldn't even make the bench.

This means that contractors that are paying themselves via a limited company will be slapped with a tax hike of up to 10% depending on income.

This makes sense as it more or less covers the amount of tax that is being lost via employers NI in these arrangements.

EDIT: I've done the calculations and due to the higher rate threshold being moved to 43k, the effects are actually minimal (compared to this year) unless they make 140K+ as states in the summer budget document. However, due to the higher rate threshold change, it may be more beneficial for these people to pay themselves more salary. Interesting.

The way this works in Arizona and Gelsenkirchen (assuming that we'll do something similar) is that the natural pitch is grown in a sort of ""tray"" that is on a track system-- it can be literally driven out of the end of the stadium and parked outdoors.  This is done in these two stadiums out of necessity-- they're domes, so the grass won't get any light to grow otherwise, but in our case, it's done more out of form than function, allowing us to cultivate a world class football pitch on top of a fieldturf American football field, which will be complete with the hardware necessary (mounting holes for uprights in the endzones, etc.) at no detriment to the natural grass pitch.

For perspective, here's a picture of the Arizona field getting some rest and recuperation [outdoors](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/University_of_Phoenix_Stadium_field_01.jpg).

This is going to make the new stadium the most versatile sporting venue in the country, and one of the top flight venues for field sport in the world, in my personal opinion.  The amount of revenue that a savvy business person like Levy will be able to make off of a deal like this is almost inconceivable, and all of that revenue comes without any harm to the primary purpose of the building as a home to Spurs (and the pitch that they will play on).",null,0,null,1436367561,null,0,false,0,csw8byn,null,t3_3cjdhu,null,t1_csw8byn,null,t3_3cjdhu,null,null,null,1437685209,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

I could use some clarification on this new National Living Wage (that isn't the living wage or apparently the NMW until you're 25). I'm over 25 though so it sounds good, if I wasn't I'd feel more inclined to start flipping tables.

The phasing out (or just reduction?) of Tax Credits is confusing. It sounds like income for a NMW worker will be 100% paid by the business paying increased wages rather than a 75/25% split with low wages propped up by the govt. I think that's great for low paid workers as it will be a pretty big increase in income; and for the treasury having to pay out less.

Those being paid just over the new NLW will see a fall in income, is that right? I'd probably be pretty unhappy about that, too. The tax free earnings increases were expected... I'm not sure Tax Credit reduction and a big NMW increase was.

I don't know much about what'll happen to the higher earners (which I consider to be 24k+). It sounds like they're losing out on WTC and low cost social housing (at above 40k). Why anyone earning over 40k was getting financial help I'll never know. They sound like the true benefit scroungers.

I think we'll hear a lot about disability benefit being cut to equal JSA but it's important to remember the benefit for the more severe cases haven't been cut nor frozen.

One of the big changes regarding the WTC is how it will affect the people that were pushed into self employment from JSA, and generally those that are struggling with self employment.

On the other hand the landlord has moved in possibly before they were supposed to (even if by hours). With no final inspection they also can't prove some of the damage/mess was yours. For example the landlord could have moved items around when he moved in. Depending on the professional advice I would also consider disputing any deductions made to the deposit with your deposit protection scheme (details of how to do this should have been given to you shortly after moving in, they are probably with your copy of the letting agreement).

Edit: Also do a Google search along the line of ""what can be deducted from my deposit"" or ""unfair deposit deductions"".

I didn't go for the sole benefit of getting 'a good job', I went for the sake of learning. It's why I spent £10k of my own money getting an MA after I graduated. I now work a decent job and it's not bad paying the loan back but others aren't so lucky.

All I did was point out that after 9/11, things went from bad to worse. Before 2001, you saw the flag, yes, but nowhere near as... fetishized and commercialized as it is today. In my hometown, for example, you'd see a flag on.. I don't know, maybe 2-3 houses a street and government buildings. It'd come out on the 4th of July, Memorial Day, and Veteran's Day (what we call 11 November). If you saw it on someone's car, which was rare, the operating assumption was that they were probably a vet (I grew up near the Norfolk navy base). 

Now, you see the damn thing everywhere. Since 9/11/2001, there's an ugly strain of borderline fascism that's cropped up in this country that didn't used to be there. Bush's ""You're with us or against us"" rhetoric, the knee-jerk ""patriotism"" of people who feel a need to plaster the flag on everything from paper plates to underwear, all of that grew out of 9/11. The way I was raised, that kind of thing just wasn't done. It was... demeaning, tacky, and thoroughly low-class. 

What we're seeing now isn't actual patriotism. It's creeping fascism. Thus my ""what passes for patriotism"" in my original comment.

The exact same thing goes for the vast majority of jobs that actually benefit society. 

In most cases, the wealthy are not wealthy through pure hard work.

Oh shut up, please.

Yes the more you earn the more you pay. Because your income is not solely yours to be proud of. 

No business succeeds without customers or a bottom line, therefore you are indebted to those people for your earnings, because without those people you have no earnings to speak of.

On top of that, the rate at which you pay does not increase at nearly the same level as the rate at which your earnings increase as your career progresses.

&gt;I'm much more in favour of flat tax rates. Say a flat 15-20% across the board so you can actually be rewarded for doing better; and still pay low taxes if you're in a low paying job. 

The fallacy that you are solely responsible for your success, you pay more because without the wider society you would have no income, there for you pay more and get more.

As previously stated, you gain more quicker than you lose, so you are still always rewarded for progressing.

The American political system is a mess, bought and paid for by the highest bidder with the choice between the right and the right with added Jesus. We should not be aiming for it, nor should we be putting it on a pedestal.

I dont really think the American system is as corrupt as people make it out to be. Its virtually impossible to do anything major in that country without cross-party bipartisan support, something that honestly has more positives than negatives. I also think its incredibly unfair to call the Democrats right-wing, Obama rejuvenated Keynesian economic policies and introduced some of the toughest banking regulations post-crash, far tougher than us. Look up the Fiscal Stimulus Act 2008 and the Dodd-Frank Act. The Republicans are also having an added Jesus content backlash lately, the moderates will probably take over the party in the primaries and if they dont, the Democrats will wipe them out in 2016 guaranteed. I'd also like to clarify that my admiration of the American political system is not their consensus political opinions, but the structure of the system that encourages bipartisan and consensus politics. If we had a similar system in the UK, no doubt it'd produce different policies, we are not Americans after all.

&gt; Closer alliance with the USA inevitably means more war. No one wants that.

Eh. I wasn't opposed to Iraq or Afghanistan, and I think we need to be taking much tougher action against the Iranians and their nuclear program, but I see your point from the British public's perspective. My other suggestion about a Britain-Canada-New Zealand-Australia union still stands though, a sort of Anglo Union.

Also, I suspect that there may be a psychological effect of burdening people with debt in much the same way that when people are tired a hill can seem higher than it is. Outside factors that overburden the individual with debt (when you factor in mortgages) could create stress, depression, and lead to psychological exhaustion.

http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/06/luis-suarez-liverpool-arsenal-transfer

He did that interview without the clubs permission and publicly criticised the club over something that wasn't true. 

&gt;""There were no promises made – categorically none – and no promises broken,"" Rodgers said on Wednesday night. ""The club and his representatives had several conversations and he knew exactly where he was at.

&gt;""There has been total disrespect of the club – this is a lack of respect of a club that has given him everything, absolutely everything. I don't believe there is a clause in his contract that says he can leave for any sort of price.""

The manager believes it was disrespectful, and I'd agree.

&gt;Barcelona is the club he dreamt of playing for as a child

That's fair enough, but why was he was trying to force a move to Arsenal so?

After that interview there was a huge backlash toward him, people (and I don't exclude myself) were saying he should be thrown out, made rot in the reserves, we could use the money to get a better replacement, how disrespectful he was after the club defended him after his incidents, basically the same shite that's been thrown toward Sterling now. But once he agreed to stay, peoples tune about him changed and couldn't wait to see him after his suspension. If Sterling stays it'll be the same thing I bet.

&gt;Meanwhile Sterling clearly has a lot of potential but he was virtually nonexistent for large parts of the second half of the season yet acted like a diva.

The season before Suarez did that interview he was a very poor finisher and was missing a lot of chances, after the interview people were saying we should sell him to Madrid and buy a proper finisher with the money. Suarez was not one of the top 3 players in the world when he did that interview, he was an extremely good player yes, but it was the following season he hit that peak that turned him into an elite player. We knew he was good, but during his last season here he was something else, up until that season people were still debating whether Torres or Suarez was better. 

&gt;On top of that, he has shown blatant disrespect towards the fans and his teammates, and let his fuckwit of an agent drag the club's name through the mud.

Again, the interview with the Guardian showed exactly that. Suarez and his agent weren't exactly saints either, why do you think Arsenal knew to bid exactly 1 pound over his supposed release clause? A figure that Suarez and his agent believed was the release clause hmmmm??

&gt;He is nowhere near and I strongly believe, will never come close to Suarez's level and he has no right to act like it

Suarez had no right to act the way he did either. Sterling more than likely won't be as good as Suarez is, but how many 20 year olds are there in the world better than him? Not many, and none we'd have a chance of getting. Suarez acted like a dick but once he agreed to stay, people's opinion changed, it'll happen again if Sterling stays.

I don't like the idea that it should be tax-payer funded, because I like the fact that the current system makes students fund their own education in a fair and indiscriminate manner.

If you're not interested in the Ninth Doctor, the best place to start with the Tenth is often considered to be ""The Girl in the Fireplace"" (Series 2, Episode 4 or 5).  His earlier episodes either are best if you have knowledge of previous events (""Christmas Invasion"", and ""School Reunion"") or just not that good (""New Earth"", and ""Tooth and Claw"").  ""Girl in the Fireplace"" has him introducing himself to the titular character, and explains most things you need to know.

For completeness, another good place to start is ""The Eleventh Hour"", (Series 5, Episode 1) which is the Eleventh Doctor's first episode. (That's the one with the bow-tie).  It was also when the current showrunner took over.

It builds on and wraps up a lot of things from the post-relaunch Doctor Who. You probably know that the curator was Tom Baker. He was the Fourth Doctor, the longest (in terms of actual TV stories) serving Doctor and the one a number of Americans of a certain age associate with the image of the time lord.

Day of the Doctor draws upon the Time War, which weighs heavy on the Doctor's soul in his later regenerations, the guilt of what the War Doctor remembered having done, but didn't do: the genocide of his own people to save all of time and space. And Queen Elizabeth wasn't picked for Ten's part of the story for no reason: she plays a part in one of Ten's stories at later points in her life, and Ten references the marriage in his final story. Elizabeth X references The Doctor's relationship in one of Eleven's first adventures.

You might also want to learn about Sarah Jane, the Doctor's quintessential companion, played by the late Elisabeth Sladen. She traveled with Three and Four until Four dropped her off in West Croydon and we didn't see her again until Series 2's School Reunion with the Tenth Doctor. She made a few other appearances in nu-Who and even got her own spinoff, which lasted for three seasons on CBBC and was a pretty decent hit. It also featured a couple appearances from the Dcctor and old friends Jo Grant (Third Doctor companion) and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. He's Kate Stewart's dad and, since actor Nicholas Courtney passed, he's been reverently mentioned in two episodes since.

I think invoking previously failed wars is a bit of a fallacy, since all those wars were fought with vastly different contexts and motivations. Need I remind you that Afghanistan hasn't exactly been a total failure, the Afghan National Army is actually independently annihilating the Taliban, and the country has overall had a net gain from the regime change. Although not fully-functioning, its elections have been fairly democratic, although there still have to be huge compromises. Its short-sighted and misplaced, IMO, to condemn Afghanistan as a giant failure. 

Iraq's legality is honestly fairly irrelevant to me, sometimes international law has to be broken for the sake of protecting stability and a populace. It'd also have been illegal to intervene in Rwanda for instance, but I think such an intervention would've been 100% justified and necessary. Saddam was known for previously attempting to develop WMDs, he had refused to disclose the status of WMDs in his country, he had refused UN inspectors, and he was engaging in a massive military buildup where his army surpassed pre-Gulf War levels. With this information presented to you, would you have taken action? I certainly would against a dictator known to use chemical weapons on his own people and invade sovereign countries in attempts to annex them. 

&gt; You can't fight guerrilla fighters in the modern age, arguably the only defeat of true guerrilla warfare was the Boer war, which if it took place today, all our leaders would be tried for war crimes.

See above. Its also worth noting that some of the iconic guerilla wars of our age, I.E. Vietnam, probably could've been won if different strategies were used. Theres a wealth of military historical analysis of this stuff but thats irrelevant. We're a politics board lol 

&gt; Lobbying is legal in America and it takes billions to win the presidency.

America is a much larger country with an infinitely larger population, not to mention third parties (Ross Perot's Reform Party in 1992 and 1996) have actually managed to claim significant portions of the popular vote, almost 20% in Perot's case. The Reform Party also got the governorship of Minnesota in 1998 with a crowd-funded campaign, a third party candidate stood two-terms as Connecticut's governor in the late 90s and early 2000s, an Independent currently stands as Alaska's Governor and has implemented a sort of basic income on a state level, and a Constitution Party candidate almost won the Colorado gubernatorials in 2012, losing by a margin of less than 3% of the vote. The simple reason is that for the most part, the Democrats and Republicans have become immense big tent parties, with the GOP containing everything from Libertarians to Paleocons to Distributists, and the Democrats containing everything from Centrists to Liberals to Social-Democrats. 

&gt; Isn't in universally accepted Bush didn't win his first election too?

Until we have some sort of harmonisation either globally or on an EU level we have to compete or will end up losing out to other countries. I'm not really sold on the greatness of Corp tax as the profits get taxed in better ways when they are taken out anyways through dividend (which was raised today), income or capital gains.  It's also pretty unfair that small companies are lumbered with big tax bills and multinationals can easily base themselves elsewhere, which puts them at at disadvantage.

&gt;The Spanish branch of the Habsburg royal family was noted for extreme consanguinity. Well aware that they owed their power to fortunate marriages, they married between themselves to protect their gains. Philip and Mariana were actually uncle and niece.

The show is over 50 years old and has multiple starting points. Each new Doctor can be a jumping on point. Usually, there is only one Doctor per episode. You saw a ""multi-Doctor special""-- awesome, but not the norm.

Most of the new series is on Netflix. If we disregard the Classic series for now (ran from 1963-1989 and featured all the Doctors who briefly showed up at the end of Day of the Doctor), there are a few good starting points. 

1. You could start with ""Rose"" from 2005, which leaves you with 8 series/seasons plus specials to watch if you want to get caught up to watch the next season live. You would see all New Series Doctors (2005-present) this way.

2. You could start with ""The Eleventh Hour,"" Series 5, Episode 1. This introduces the Doctor with the bow tie from Day of the Doctor. This method means you only have 4 seasons to watch before you're caught up. You can go back and watch the rest at your leisure.

3. You could start from Series 8, Episode 1, ""Deep Breath."" This introduces the current Doctor, played by Peter Capaldi. He's the one who shows up briefly at the end of Day of the Doctor and wiggles his eyebrows. With this method you only have one season to watch before you're caught up. 

4. You could jump around and watch some highlights from each Doctor. This is a perfectly valid way to get the feel of the show.

null,false,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,null,"***Danny Ings today gave his first interview as a Liverpool player after making a switch to Anfield from Burnley – read on to get the striker's thoughts in full, while the whole chat can be watched on LFCTV GO.***

**Welcome to Liverpool FC - how does it feel to officially be here?**

*It feels fantastic. Obviously I had a summer away but at the same time I was really looking forward to getting in and meeting everyone.*

**When you heard of the interest, how quickly did you want it done, with the intent that Liverpool had shown to get you here?**

*Straight away really - as soon as I knew that Liverpool were interested, it was a no-brainer. It was the only club on my mind, to be fair. And now that it has happened, it's fantastic for me and my family.*

**The manager will have played a big part in getting you here. What has he said to you about the kind of player that he thinks you can become?**

*He's fantastic at developing young players. For a player like me, I think it will be perfect to work with him; I'm really looking forward to getting that relationship with him and the rest of the coaches and the players as well. It's something I'm really excited to do.*

**What has he said to you about where he can take you in the future?**

*First of all, he wants me to come in, settle in and get used to the lads and enjoy training. Then we're going to do some tactical stuff, which he does with every player, as you do coming in. Then obviously I'll see how his team plays and how I can adapt to the way that Liverpool play. It's definitely going to be a challenge but it's a challenge that I'm looking forward to. I just can't wait to get started.*


**What about coming into Melwood and seeing the place? There's a magic about Liverpool, isn't there?**

*It's a special club, everybody knows it. With all the history that's here. Everybody knows about Melwood. Today, to come in and see everyone and all the staff, it's definitely a massive step in my career and I'm over the moon.*

**When you look around, are there quite a few faces that you know? Because that helps the settling-in process if you know a couple of the lads here already...**

*It does. Playing against them, you sort of have an understanding of each other, so you sort of half know each other. I know a few of the lads anyway so I'm sure they're going to help me settle in and help me be part of the team.*

**You mention the manager - he has played a big part in giving young players a chance. Does that give you confidence that he can help you get onto the next level?**

*Of course, there's nothing better for a young player like me than to be working for a manager like that, who loves to bring all these young boys in and give them a chance. With the development that he has for young players, it suits me down to the ground and hopefully we can have a great relationship for the future.*

**It is a young squad when you look around, but there is also massive experience that you can learn from - players that have played in World Cups and different countries too. Is that something you're looking forward to?**

*Yes, definitely. You need young, hungry, developing players in your team, but you also need that experience to level things out and get hold of some of the youngsters when they need advice in certain areas of the pitch. I think there's a great mixture here and that was also one of the big reasons why I wanted to come here - to learn from other players, learn different styles of football and different opinions to make myself better.*

**The club has added strength elsewhere as well - Roberto Firmino adds that bit of excitement, James Milner offers great experience too...**

*It's always a massive sign when a club brings in quite a few players during the window - it shows that you mean business. The standard of the players that are coming in is fantastic. The players will definitely add to the team and really make it stronger.*

***Watch Ings on tour with the Reds this summer - click here for ticket details, or watch on LFCTV and LFCTV GO.***

**Strikers gravitate to strikers and you need to look no further than the likes of Daniel Sturridge for players that are proven in the Premier League, and perhaps his best football is still to come here?**

*Of course, he's an unbelievable striker. He is one of those players who has come through the ranks, he has not had it easy. Now he's here and he's established; he's a fantastic, talented football player I can learn from.*

**You've played at Anfield before, with Burnley. What was the experience like? How did it feel to play at Anfield as an opposition player?**

*To be honest, I didn't enjoy that night because I didn't really get a kick. I felt that every time I had the ball, there was a lot of pressure on me. With the atmosphere from the fans as well, it can feel a little bit intimidating. I wasn't intimidated on the night, I was just frustrated that I couldn't show everyone what I was capable of that night.*

**The atmosphere is a very special one when you become a Liverpool player - are you looking forward to that?**

*That was also a massive reason why I wanted to come here, because the fanbase is massive - you go anywhere in the world and there are Liverpool fans. The night was unbelievable and the atmosphere was unbelievable. Obviously Liverpool beat us that night and played extremely well, but to get a feel of what it's actually like - because I'd never played at Anfield before - it really showed me how strong the atmosphere is and how much the crowd do get behind the team. It's fantastic.*

**You're No.28 - what was the thinking behind the shirt number you've taken?**

*I had a chat with my agent and a few friends and we thought that moving to such a big club like this, you need to take all the pressure off yourself. Taking one of the low numbers does make a difference, because some of the players that have worn those shirts have been superstars and world-class players. So it was important to start with a high number and my reason is to work my way down. When I achieve success here, that's when I'll take a shirt like that; until then, I'll keep No.28, keep my head down and work hard.*

**Finally, what's your message to Liverpool fans and what they can expect?**

*Hopefully we can have a fantastic relationship. On the pitch, hopefully they get behind me and I can do extremely well for them, for myself and for everyone at Liverpool Football Club.*

There are also a lot of reasonably priced hardware add-ons to teach low level programming. Some things like that might appear for the MicroBit, but RPi is available to everybody, worldwide, not just UK year 7s, so there is going to be much more choice.

And the RPi is already established and here to stay. The MicroBit could have bugs (I think the Pi did at first) and we don't even know if the BBC will make another batch next year.

However, haven't the rules about spam come about because those providing the service throttle those who look like they are trying to abuse it. For instance, it you try sending 100,000 emails you will find they soon get tagged as spam and your mail server gets blocked. In other words those responsible for delivering the messages are not only able to block undesirable messages but also have the will to do so.

The problem with phone calls is the service provider gets paid to deliver the calls, they have no interest in blocking revenue. In other words the network providers have the capability to block undesirable phone calls they don't have the will to do so. 
There is one exception to that I heard of. Back in the 1990's internet access was often made via dial-up phone lines (remember aol?). Some crooks spread a virus that infected windows and internet explorer so that instead of the computer dialling the user's internet provider, eg aol, it used a premium rate number to dial up some servers in Tuvalu, who then connected the hapless user to their normal internet provider. The average user was thus unaware they were accessing the internet using a premium rate line... Until they got a bill for hundreds or thousands of pounds. 
BT, who ran practically everything, refused to do anything to help these unfortunates and demanded full payment. 
The Irish telecom, being unwilling to assist a criminal enterprise, simply switched off auto dial from Eire to Tuvalu.

You can. They could scrap council tax &amp; create a land value tax which is progressive. They could remove the upper limit on NI contributions so that it is more progressive. They could cut or remove VAT so the tax system becomes progressive, as they did in America for instance (sales taxes are very low). 

You see you talk like they have a choice, like they can choose not to eat, or choose not to rent a home. These are not choices these are essential realities to the situation. Do you think we should have a regressive, flat, or progressive tax system? If you think the middle or latter then the tax system is unfair &amp; needs changing. Most people think it should be progressive, and most think that it is, even though it's actually not.

If this makes students think twice about going to University, it might be a good thing. There's so many courses at University which are basically not needed in todays job market and as a result there's thousands of graduates who come out of University perhaps worse off than not going to University because they're now ""over qualified"" for a lot of positions, not to mention they've got a lot of debt too.

That's because it IS unfair. Arts (as in ""creative media"") are economically viable now - to a degree, and make up a huge part of the economy, from film, advertising and in other areas.

And yet arts funding is cut. 

&gt;A £50,000 loan to fund an aspiring amateur athlete reach his personal best is just as legitimate a cause as someone who wants to read Nietzsche.

Ditto sports funding. We produce fantastic sports people despite this, and it's hailed as a success of the system rather than a success in spite of it.

None of what you say is wrong. At all. But to suggest then that studying anything at university is a waste, even if you need to do some less than fulfilling work to get to where you want to. I'm several years behind my peers in my career because I chose to study the British left for 5 years at uni, and I'll never make that back or earn as much as them, because it was from a remote East-Welsh uni which is of decreasing repute. I have friends who left school at 18 and are successful business owners (tree surgeon and lighting tech respectively), and I expect I'll never be any better off than them because of my university 'career'. 

I'll pay back my loan, like I pay my NHI and my vehicle excise and I'll hope that one day my taxes might be a bit higher to allow more people to achieve what they want. Be it academic, business or athleticism. Problem is, until people take a less selfish view of the world it's unlikely to happen - wealth will remain at the top (lower business taxes and trickle-down is a horrid myth), and chances are, until people know what they're missing, tradesmen will continue to go undervalued.

Fuck this is depressing.

If my grant is replaced with a loan my debt will effectively double for every year I'm in education. It really does seem like they don't want the poor to go to uni or come out with a good education. The only saving grace I have is that I'm Welsh and the Welsh government is far kinder than the English. Hopefully the assembly can mitigate this blatant attack on the poor. 

The threshold of £21k only does so much. Anyone in STEM, in uni for a career is going to earn more than the threshold but not enough to be comfortably above it. Buying a house will be much more difficult with double the debt over your head. Most notably repayments are highest between £25k to £30k. After that interest and such decreases substantially. The people who pay the most are those who come out of uni into an okay but not exceptional job. The upper class as always get an easy ride.

Its £9k for tuition, about £7.5k for living costs under the current system a year. Assuming that's all loans then its £16.5k a year or £49.5k debt for a three year degree.

50 fucking grand of debt for a degree while the current crop of politicians paid bugger all in their days. An attack on the poor and nothing less.

Countries that rely on a deregulated, low tax economy are typically a lot smaller than the UK and have a lot less expenditure on things like aircraft carriers, submarines, olympics, bloated health services etc. The same argument has been made for years about how beneficial deregulation was in the 80s, even though it (and its partner policies in the US) lead to one of the worst economic depressions since the Great one. I haven't seen any evidence that a large country with little industry can survive on being a tax haven. 

One example of when it goes badly wrong is Liberia. There are probably more brass-plate shipping companies in Monrovia, and more registered ships, than any country in the world. However, these companies bring little revenue into the country, as the reason they are all located there is the hilariously low tax rate.

I'm not some nutter saying if we lower corporation tax we'll end up like Liberia (it's got a few other problems going on...) but I don't think it's as clear as ""lower tax, more companies paying less therefore higher net revenue"".

&gt; My understanding is when the fourth new signing is announced, the Club will turn their attentions to signing another striker/goalscorer.

The government (and not just this government but all governments going back to Blairs 1997 Labour government that brought in national minimum wage) thinking has been that offering an equal minimum wage creates a disincentive for employers to take on youngsters. Put yourself in the shoes of an employer... you can pick Person A who is 18, has no previous work history and his references are actually a school teacher and a mate of his mums. Person B is 29, has a 10 year work history and exemplary references citing how few sick days he took and his dedication to the company. Who are you going to employ? It means person A can't get on the job ladder - which then has a knock on effect because by the time he's 20 he still has no references and no job history. 

The Reason I think it is unfair is that 25 seems like an arbitrary age cut-off, and by age 25 most people are 'as employable' as someone older. Certainly by 25 most people who have degrees will already have them. 21 seems like a fairer age to me, since that has a legal basis in adulthood, whereas 25 is just a number plucked out of thin air.

&gt;My understanding is that he was one of the best defenders in Europe last season and will be an exciting new addition to the West Ham United squad.

Think this is still Ogbonna. Abdennour's price is high and Ogbonna is still a ""great defender"", but the two in front of him (Chiellini and Bonucci) are the best pairing on the planet right now.

&gt;My understanding is when the fourth new signing is announced, the Club will turn their attentions to signing another striker/goalscorer.

We've been linked to a bevy of them. This isn't surprising.

&gt;The Club are also looking to bring in another highly rated midfielder **and** hope a loan move will **also** be finalised by end of the month.

 In my opinion I see the student debt as more of an investment. In the sense that if you are doing well and can afford it your money gets paid back in, but if you are not doing well/canr afford it then your let off until you are/can. 

 My gripe with the debt is that in terms of a lot of degrees, I do not think 9k a year is fair. If i'm honest, and you may disagree, I feel STEM degrees should cost more for the student than mosrt arts. If you think about the costs of the technology and labs needed to complete these degrees, we are talking about tens of millions if not more. In a subject like English or history or philosophy, the only cost is the lecturers and lecture space, and a few books. It costs a lot more to educate a STEM student than an arts student.

So people like NOI are a laughable fringe while ""dangerous black men"" was what the show Cops was built on. The fact I know that the show exists is indicative of how popular the show was and how far reaching its consequences were in creating the notion that Black Guy = Crime. Now the people who think this aren't racists like that guy who shot up that Church. They are ordinary people who have an unconscious bias. 

I once got reported for ""unintelligible accent"". My accent's scottish. I am Indian in ethnicity. The joke was that the guy who had to go listen to the complaint has the same Edinburgh accent. That's the sort of bullshit abnormal crap I have to put up with at the most harmless level.

Again, poor education (sincce they were going to work the factories) meant they often were in the situation where there were more guys than women and their parents who saw nothing wrong with it encouraged them to get married to someone in thee family. Now we see the third generation fighting back against that. This sort of mirrors the general trend within Pakistan against the practice. 

There is a joke in charity, it's only a problem if white people talk about it. There has been education programs to encourage marriage to reduce incest for decades. It's only a problem NOW.

Liverpool on the other hand, at least their fans, have this attitude that it's time to go unless they don't get everything we want for the player, in which case the player should be thankful to bask in their istoree while his career gets derailed.

If you loan less money, the total amount you have to pay back is lower, true, but you are also way more likely to pay it all back, if you have £100k of debt, you're really unlikely to pay it all back, and you ALSO PAY at 9% above threshold.

2. Russian hockey and the North American game are completely different. The style, physicality, tactics, etc. are streets apart. Even the rinks are different sizes. I feel like these differences in play and development are much more pronounced in hockey than European football.  
3. After only 6 games, the Thrashers fired their coach, Bob Hartley, who, funny enough, is French-Canadian and is pretty famous for struggling with English, as French is his first language (read up on the 2000-2001 Avalanche).  
4. While both Hossa and Kovalchuk put up a point a game (Kovy had 87 in 79), the defense was atrocius, and Kari Lehtonen sat for half a season behind the woeful Johan Hedberg in goal. Slava Kozlov was a consistent point producer, but was 35 and declining. 
5. Hossa was traded to the Pens midseason for a smattering of prospects.  
  
I love the hockey reference, but the 07 Thrashers aren't the best example of an ethnically-divided locker room hurting a team. As any Thrashers fan can attest to, they hurt themselves in a variety of ways.

Don't agree, them excelling on their loans isn't how loans should be judged and I would hope the world class coaches that we have at Chelsea are fully aware of that.

null,false,Suchthefool_UK,eng-GreaterLondon,Graaata Laandan,null,"&gt;just because you earn 20 times more than someone else you don't consume 20 times more.

That's true, but the value of the products people buy differs. I could just be tight as hell and be rich but rich people tend to buy more luxurious items which increases with VAT. As someone who was earning a normal wage, I could buy a car to get around for £7000 (1400 in VAT). Or if I was earning 20x more, I won't buy 20 £7000 cars and I probably won't be buying a Bugatti either but I will probably try to buy a nice car at around the £40,000 mark (8000 in VAT). Rich people don't buy more stuff, they just tend to buy more *expensive* stuff.

&gt;They could scrap council tax &amp; create a land value tax.

Council tax already takes some things into consideration; it's not a perfect system and could for sure use and overhaul but the land value tax is not a solution. Let's use London for an example. You lived in Hoxton 30 years ago, bad area to live but you got by. Bought a house under the right to buy that thatcher brought in. Skip forward 30 years, you're earning a decent wage (Say £39k) but by no means rich. However, the land you're sitting on is now worth a shit tonne of money due to rapidly rising property prices. This money isn't currently liquid but the government wants to tax you according to how much your property is worth. This could cause all sorts of financial problems and *force* you to sell just so you can afford to pay the tax. This will create an even bigger property bubble as not only can the rich be able to buy but only the rich can afford to rent. Do you think this is progressive?

&gt;They could remove the upper limit on NI contributions

You complained about people in higher tax bands having to pay less than the people at the bottom. So your idea to sort this is to create more strain on the lower tax bands to pay as the rich get away with paying less?

&gt;They could cut or remove VAT so the tax system becomes progressive, as they did in America for instance (sales taxes are very low)

So what would replace it? More income tax? Plus, America isn't quite the shining beacon for offering governmental social services to the population. 

&gt;You see you talk like they have a choice, like they can choose not to eat, or choose not to rent a home.

You don't pay VAT on food and rent.

&gt;Most people think it should be progressive, and most think that it is, even though it's actually not. This is the report.

I haven't read the report yet but that's from June 2014. There's been 3 budgets since. Although a lot may still apply, saying many think it's progressive but it's not means that there are people and at least some of them are qualified to think that it is progressive.

He stole the Tardis, his time/spaceship that looks like a Police Box on the outside, and ran away. We still don't know the specifics about why he left.

He wanders, seeing the universe, but he gets lonely so he travels with a ""companion."" This is usually a woman from Earth, but there have been men and aliens, too. The basic premise is that he shows the companion the universe. In Day of the Doctor Clara was the companion.

He runs into a lot of trouble as he travels, and has made many enemies over the years because he often takes sides in conflicts he comes across. He stops wars, alien invasions, oppression, tyranny and slavery. He has the skill set to handle these situations and feels obliged to help out rather than simply observe. 

Each Doctor has different adventures and a slightly different personality. Some of the new series has plot arcs running through each Doctor's episodes, but many of the stories are stand-alone. The Doctor ""regenerates"" when he's near death, which means transforming into a new body. This happens when the actor wants to move on to other roles.

I'll take a side.

Really?

They have three different manifestos and are deeply authoritarian. Finances were neither internally or externally reviewed or explained (whereas UKIP's were). They, for example, wanted to make if legal to join/fund/support ISIS; they gave little concern for security. How could you prefer them?

&gt;*I simply can't support UKIP, I agree with the greens before UKIP. **The members of UKIP are mostly idiots** and there are far too many 'bad eggs'. They are nationalist idiots that support populist policies that they cannot realistically implement.*

Play the ball. Not the player. Poke policy before people and people before party. I'll not accept this avenue of attack.

&gt;*I simply can't support UKIP, I agree with the greens before UKIP. The members of UKIP are mostly idiots **and there are far too many 'bad eggs'.** They are nationalist idiots that support populist policies that they cannot realistically implement.*

They've had their bad apples, but so has every party (and I think whataboutery is fine to use by the way). The undesirables stretch across the spectrum and some just end up in UKIP. Some act out and bring the party disrepute. The practice of contextomy is famous throughout our opposition. Look, for example, when demographics are mentioned (Rotherham, Romanians etc). When someone is genuinely racist they are expelled and condemned for it. Such attitudes are even against their constitution, yet UKIP *still* receive the slurs. They also get unfair coverage (for example, after immigration, the rest of their manifesto was ignored). The so called bad eggs only make up a few percent (out of 600+ of them) and then when a foot man (not even a candidate) say something intolerant, such as a councillor, it makes front page news. Unlike the rest of the parties. The reds and blues even employ ex BNP in which we forbid and we still get accused of affiliation. I call it unfair to complain considering such circumstances. Wouldn't you agree?

&gt;*I simply can't support UKIP, I agree with the greens before UKIP. The members of UKIP are mostly idiots and there are far too many 'bad eggs'. **They are nationalist idiots** that support populist policies that they cannot realistically implement.*

They are patriotic. They support, believe in and defend our country. That's not nationalistic. Nationalism is about supremacy. In which defending culture and sovereignty apparently is, but really is not. Our current immigration policy is though. It puts several European nationalities above the rest of the world. That's ignored, and ironically, we get slandered for trying to fix that. The parties which support ""positive"" discrimination (which we oppose and get smeared for) promote nationalism by giving more, not equal, ""rights"" ^privileges and outcome ^not ^opportunity to certain minorities. Again, I won't accept the abuse hurled here. I find it understandable though with how good the spin doctors of Britain are.

&gt;*I simply can't support UKIP, I agree with the greens before UKIP. The members of UKIP are mostly idiots and there are far too many 'bad eggs'. They are nationalist idiots **that support populist policies that they cannot realistically implement.***

They do support such policies in which, however, I believe they can implement. Obviously not with one MP, but with either becoming the opposition, majority or by calling referenda, I think it's entirely plausible. It is all explained in their manifesto in which I am yet to find an error of. You can find it [here (online magazine)](http://issuu.com/ukip/docs/theukipmanifesto2015?e=16718137/12380620) or [here (pdf)](ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/wmatrix/ukmanifestos2015/localpdf/UKIP.pdf).

As for your suggestion that population should be redistributed such that every area is essentially a microcosm of the national demographic, how on earth do you propose that would work? Like you can't reasonably just relocated everyone just so every area has the same demographic...

EDIT: Like seriously, suggesting that the regional makeup of an area should reflect the national race makeup is perhaps the most absurd idea I have ever heard. I mean let alone that you can't possibly balance the demography of every region without restricting everyone's (including the white British) freedom of movement, it works both ways. 0.001% of the population are Cornish (it's a recognised minority ethnicity in the UK, and I picked this as its also the ethnicity with the least members), are you suggesting that therefore the population of say Edinburgh should have 0.001% Cornish people. How would you even distribute 0.001% Cornish people across the entire country such that 0.001% is the percentage of cornish people in every region. There's not even enough Cornish people in existence.

null,false,w0ss4g3,cnty-wales,Not Welsh but I live here,null,"Ok, let's say you have a £45k debt leaving uni. That means you've been given £45k, probably spent £27k on fees. That leaves £18k to cover your living expenses for 3 years - costs which you'd probably have had to cover whether you chose to go to uni or not.

Now let's say you earn £22k (i.e. £1000 over the threshold to enter repayment) for the entire 30 years. This is unrealistic, as you'll probably earn more as you go on, but let's keep it nice and simple.

At that point, over the 30 years, you will pay 9% ""tax"" out of your salary servicing the £45k debt. That works out a little over £2.5k. So even if you hadn't been paying the £9k fees, just your living expenses, then you're way ahead. Now factor in that inflation over those 30 years is going to make that £2.5k worth less as time goes on than it was when you original took the original loan.

That's a fucking unbelievable deal, and if your earnings drop then you simply don't pay, without any penalty. Even better, if you lose your job half way through the year and end up earning less than the £21k, you just have to ask and they will refund you the payments for that tax year. It's literally the best loan you will ever get in your life.

EDIT: Let's assume your salary (starting at £22k) increases at a rate of 2.5% per year and they don't move the payment threshold with inflation (which they will, so the actual amount would be less than this).. you still only pay back around £30k over the 30 years.. again with inflation you're still way ahead.

Benitez agreed but said they had to get Barry first because if they couldn't sign him, he wouldn't want Keane. He'd formulated a system in his head and without Barry, Keane wouldn't fit into it.

&gt; According to Benitez, Parry said he had to do the Keane deal straight away but told him not to worry as there would be enough left in the kitty to buy Barry. Once Keane was signed the Americans refused to match Aston Villa's valuation and Benitez was told to forget Barry...they had decided he Barry was too old for the price Villa were asking.

Orlando's fans aren't making a great impression so far. They show up in numbers but are getting a reputation for hooliganism.

See my response to the other guy:

Poor person can't afford a £400 sofa, they buy it on credit, pay £40 a month for 18 months, end up paying nearly double the price of the sofa. They're poor, they can't afford to spend that £400 up front, they've got no savings. Not having a sofa means they've got nowhere to sit in the evenings after work to relax, and a bare lounge, and an unwelcoming feeling for guests. Or an oven, or a fridge, or any number of everyday household items that require a large upfront cost that some people simply cannot afford. So they end up paying a lot more for the same items, because they're too poor to pay for them in one go.

I'm not sure if changing maintenance grants to loans for the poorest counts quite in the same vein. But it does put another deterrent in the way of poor kids going to university. Social mobility is hard - which is why it's been supported in the past with maintenance grants and bursaries. Most poor people had poor parents. Most people who didn't go to university have parents who didn't go to university. Giving them financial leg-ups like grants and bursaries meant it became a real option, without being trapped in debt forever after. Removing those grants now makes that debt a deterrent and a barrier - even if it might never get repaid - because in their experience, debt means suffering. It means constant money worry, living hand to mouth, month to month. The same experiences are likely not true for middle class people, and so the student loan isn't such a deterrent to them.",null,0,null,1436379311,null,0,false,0,cswg6pq,null,t3_3cj6ql,null,t1_cswg6pq,null,t1_csw353b,null,null,null,1437690904,null,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10,null

I like marquee signings as much as the next guy, but I hope Parish and Co have considered both the recent injuries and his age, plus what his attitude maybe like if Pardiola implodes this season and weighed that up against Kebab's potential impact as a match winner, converting shitty draws into wins and zero point losses into draws, which will keep us away from the relegation battle.

Regarding the squad, say we have 5-10 injuries for a 4-10 week window, our relative paucity of top class prem players is really housed in our first XI - certainly our top defenders and match winners are not sat on our bench. So for me i hope we manage to sign a marquee guy like Cabaye or (and!)

First off:  Imagine if you earned £20,000 in a year pre-tax and were deducted £2,000 in tax.  If I wrote an article saying ""Mr/Ms Redditor receives £18,000 in government subsidies and tax breaks"" you'd tell me to fuck off; that's your cash.  The majority of the £93bn is tax credits, not subsidies.  Taxing a business less is not really a subsidy.

Second:  Yes these tax credits are generally handed out to big multinationals. Boo big business!  But guess what, Nissan can build a car factory wherever it fucking likes in Europe.  You know what I really hate?  Poor, marginalised people in Sunderland getting jobs and having the right to improve their quality of life.  Grrrr!!  Cos that's what the vast majority of tax credits and subsidies to businesses go to; encouraging companies to open big projects in areas where the area is crumbling and a surge of employment is needed.

Here's the best bit:  whenever stories like this grab public attention it makes it harder for the government to alter market incentives in a social way, hence more jobs go to London and Munich, and the poor, run-down people get inadvertently fucked over.

To preface my argument: unemployment is highest amongst the young because we have far less experience and fewer skills than our contemporaries in their late 20s / 30s.  As such, an employer will rarely chose a 20 yr old over a 30 yr old to fill a position.

The government announced plans for legislation that will HELP 20 year olds get a job because if it's a position that requires training they can now justify hiring the 20 yr old person over the 30 yr old because it costs the employer less.

This same legislation also means that when this 20 yr old hits 25 he/she also gets a big pay rise if still on minimum wage.  Not only that, because they could get a job out of school / uni they can actually enjoy the raised minimum wage which they may not have otherwise because they wouldn't have a job.

The government just announced that young people will find it easier to get a job and when they hit 25 they'll get a higher minimum wage and people are fucking angry about this?!?

Just to clarify, with my comment I wasn't trying to convey that the Greens are my favourite party, just that I support them before UKIP.

I dislike the green's views on Nuclear Energy, GM crops and many of their economic views.

I like the greens views on cycling infrastructure, it would relieve our health service as many people would chose a healthy lifestyle and reduce pollution and carbon emissions. They are also the only party to take climate change seriously - no other party truly cares.

&gt;deeply authoritarian

I'd disagree, the current policy from *all* other parties towards extremism are authoritarian, we're seeing our civil liberties degraded because of these and the greens have always been strongly against things like Snooper's Charter and Mass Surveillance. This respect towards the civil liberties that other parties don't often have is one of the main reasons I like the greens.

The current policy towards extremism/terrorism is flawed, we've seen countries like Denmark take a more relaxed approach - lots of the time these ""extremists"" are just normal people that have become pissed off for whatever reason and are looking for an alternative. There was a post on reddit about how the Danish police asked a suspected extremist planning to join ISIS for a cup of coffee and a chat, and then had them talk to a Muslim anti-extremist councillor and that was enough to sway him away. Our policy of shutting out these people once they leave/plan to leave is aggressive, and a lot of the time they are on the fence and that policy forces them onto the extremist side.

I think Natalie Bennett wasn't trying to sympathise with ISIS, but promote a more logical approach to our foreign policy and policy towards extremism to tackle it. It's clearly not working.




And even if the reasons I provided for my dislike of UKIP are wrong, I'm still more left winged and UKIP tends to have right winged policies.

&lt;$30,000 = 15% tax rate

.&gt;$30,001 = 60% tax rate

Let's imagine Dr.Jones makes $50,000 a year. How will he be taxed?

His $50,000 won't be taxes at 60%. If that was true, he would make more money by earning $30,000, right? That would discourage people from working hard and making more money, right? Who would do $50,000 worth of work when they will earn less than someone doing $30,000 worth of work?

So, what they do is this: 

Dr.Jones total income = $50,000

The first $30,000 made by Dr.Jones will be taxed at 15%

Then, subtract $50,000-$30,000 and you get $20,000.

That means that after his first $30,000 being taxed 15%, he still has $20,000 left to be taxed.

So, then they tax his $20,000 by 60%.

See, it's separately taxed so that you will never LOSE money by earning more gross salary.

There are recurring characters, and many of these develop over the show's run and eventually leave or come back (for example, Sarah Jane Smith, one of the OldWho Companions, returned for a bit in her spinoff show I have yet to watch), but there's nothing particularly important enough to watch in any order.  
Heck, I grew up watching OldWho repeats, which were in a nonsensical chaos in order, episodes of Pertwee intertwined with Baker episodes in no particular order beyond the individual stories.


There's a few classic episodes that set the tone for a few characters, like Genesis of the Daleks laying out the Dalek backstory... The first episode with the Master and his plan with plastic that eats people gets you an idea of his capabilities...

&gt;the Living Wage Foundation’s figures were set under the assumption that tax credits will be available to top up low pay. With dramatic reductions in these forming the centrepiece of Osborne’s swingeing £12bn welfare cuts, hourly pay would have to rise sharply to compensate. Osborne’s National Living Wage will not achieve this.

&gt;Osborne’s new measures are likely to worsen levels of UK inequality.

&gt;The graph below is from the OBR’s analysis. It’s clear the bulk of the gain flows disproportionately to wealthy households.

Not for student loans, current student loan interest rates are 1.5% APR which is as low as a mortgage. Student loans are also not required to be paid until you hit a certain income bracket which means they have absoloutely no effect on the poor. 

&gt; Giving them financial leg-ups like grants and bursaries meant it became a real option, without being trapped in debt forever after.

University is still a real option. Student loans aren't required to be paid until you hit a certain income which means the debt might as well not exist until you're no longer on low income. Maintenance grants didn't make university more of an option than a loan would, the money is still present you just have to pay it back when you're earning a reasonable amount instead of getting to keep it just because you have poor parents.

&gt; Removing those grants now makes that debt a deterrent and a barrier - even if it might never get repaid - because in their experience, debt means suffering.

Citation needed. After the raise in tuition fees to almost three-fold previous levels university administration still went up and it didn't cause a surge in equality.

I was geared up to be unhappy based on the reporting and I am now conflicted. I find myself less &amp; less identifying as ""Left"" but also am finding more disdain for the Right (I think I like facts which apparently have little to no place in modern British politics). 

For the longest time I have thought in-work benefits were a form of corporate welfare as well (basically subsidizing poverty wages), but based on early reports it was thought this Budget would be all Stick (Cut the Benefits) and no Carrot (somehow raise wages). In the end I am curious to see what seems to be quite a large raise in the minimum wage (re-branded as well for whatever reason) since a lot of commentators would have us believe that this kind of increase would result in fire raining from the Sky &amp; the Beast walking among us.

And yet there already are. I went to university at 18 and dropped out halfway through the resit of my second year. I had to pay back the grant I was awarded that year as a result of dropping out. So far, so fair.

Then I went back to university when I was 25. I couldn't get any funding whatsoever for the first two years of my course because I had already been at university for 3 years (although back when I dropped out they told me it would only count as two years. Of course, 5 years had passed and Student Finance England had become the Student Loans Company). 

It would make sense if you couldn't get funding for having taken out loans before - and in my case, I had - but that isn't the criteria. The criteria is based on *whether you've attended university*.

If my interpretation is correct, then its horrendous. Chancellor gets cash up front, on the promise that we pay no tax upon retirement (A hell of a lot of pensioners pay little to no tax on their pension anyway, median pension figure in 12/13 was around £18k after a quick google), so you lose out on 20%/40% benefit when you are paying in, and gain 0%/20% that you would have paid on the way out. 

In fact it is worse than that, since as you are not saving any tax up front, a pension essentially becomes a stocks and shares ISA, and you would only pay tax on the gain, not the full amount, so you lose 20%/40% on the total, and gain a saving of 0%/20% tax on the gain element when you draw it as a pension. 

Almost makes putting money into a pension a complete waste of time, Might as well save/invest it where you have much more control over it. 

I am hoping I have completely misunderstood it, or it will never get any further than the green paper, but since it is a brilliant wheeze, Gov't now gets increased cash flow, Gov't in 30-40 years time has to pay the bill. 

Thats the other problem with it, what if the Gov't in 30-40 years time decides they need a bit of money and starts taxing pensions again, so I will pay on the way in and pay on the way out?

This is a fairer system (from one that is already very fair and very cheap) because it still means that the poorest students can get a university education, however if they benefit (quite significantly) from it then they may have to pay more back.

Whilst technically a poorer student will have a higher student debt, in reality they are no different than any other graduate who earns the same money as them. If you take two students from the same course at the same university in the same graduating class with the same class of degree and they enter the workforce and earn equal money for the 30 years that they are required to pay off loans before the remaining balance is written off then they will both have paid the same amount for their education although the 'rich' student had a smaller maintenance loan whilst the 'poor' student had a higher one.

This can only 'negatively' affect the poorer students if they will earn enough money to pay back the whole loan in under 30 years [average student debt is ~£45k post-grad which is £1.5k/year if paid across all 30 years, which equates to a mean average wage of ~£37.5k/year based on the loan being interest-free, which it isn't, which will mean the required wage level to pay it all back will be higher, I believe was estimated to be £50k/year when they upped the fees], in which case they've benefitted a lot from this system and would surely be able to pay back more until the 30 years is up.

So assuming these loans were interest-free, which they aren't, the 'poor' student would have to earn over an average of ~£37.5k/year over the 30 years post-graduation to be in a position to face paying back the extra money which they may have received. We effectively have a graduate-tax system in place, but there's an earnings threshold before you start paying and a 30-year period in which you'll be charged.

Edit: The total earnings for someone to pay back the 'average' debt over the whole 30-year period is ~£1.13million, just incase you wanted to do some calculations based on a wage that would vary across that period, since many people start off below that and then progress to earn more.",null,0,null,1436382671,null,0,false,0,cswikqy,null,t3_3cj6ql,null,t1_cswikqy,null,t1_csw1jki,null,null,null,1437692802,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

But how can they base a campaign on something they have no control over? Sinn Fein, being in the North, are actively fighting for a United. Sinn Fein down South use it as a campaign tool because they can do something about it in the North. What are Fianna Fail going to say? They both have stated their support to unite Ireland, but why bother talk about it all the time when they have no political influence? Any politician you have heard using popular themes to get votes have been when those themes affect the people. For example, Obama went to great lengths to secure the American-Irish vote which is exceptionally supporting of a United Ireland, but Obama never mentioned a United Ireland because what is he going to say he's going to do?

I think, this being very generalised of course, the feeling towards loans is that unless you're earning extremely good money early out of university you just can't expect to pay back the entire thing and so therefore it's not really worth thinking about. I remember using the gov.uk website which has a tool to calculate repayment and interest on the loan. I will have, when I graduate, roughly £40,000 of debt - I fiddled with the government tool and even earning £70,000 per annum it would take me 10 years to fully pay it off. Even paying off more than the interest would add to the debt is something like £30,000 per annum which is a figure most post-grads aren't going straight into. Any politician is delusional if they expect a majority of students to pay back loans.

I mean you're flat out wrong here: 

&gt;Student loans aren't required to be paid until you hit a certain income which means the debt might as well not exist until you're no longer on low income.

The loan gets written off 25 years after you are eligible to start the repayments(2007 onwards) so there's no chance a student would sit under £21,000 and never pay it back.

I oppose IHT cuts in general, and I don't like this change. The only thing I do like about it is that it's restricted to the main residence only. There should be a significant wealth tax on death rather than earnings/regressive taxes.

The rest I agree with OP.


As for what the LibDem response was to BBC news....

&gt;Lib Dem leadership contender Tim Farron:
For all its talk about striving, aspiration and creating a Northern Powerhouse, this budget has delivered none of it. It shows that the Conservatives, devoid of fresh ideas, have simply rehashed old ones that were rejected over the last few years.

I feel it's important to state agreement when something is there you agree with. First of all to be honest and constructive but secondly to defeat the ridiculous populism that few people actually fall for any more.

I hope Farron was partially quoted by the BBC and they only went for the negative stuff.

Those saying that this prevents access to higher education for people are wrong - if anything it improves it by increasing the amount of money available for living costs (albeit not as a grant but as a loan, but either way its something they will not have to pay back until they earn over a certain threshold) 

I know it sounds like they are taking money away from the poor (its yes and no I guess) but overall they ARE making more money available to poorer students, but its just not ""free money"" if that makes sense

null,false,Silhouette,null,null,null,"The trouble with this one is that it's a populist measure (look at all those nasty contractors dodging NI!) but as with so many headline-grabbers it conveniently ignores the reality of working that way.

For example, you can go the freelancer/contractor route without forming a limited company at all. Many people do, and as self-employed people they'll pay certain rates of NI. They are likely to pay significantly lower contributions overall than what they would pay as an employee. They will pay *much* lower contributions than if they paid everything out via salary from a limited company and therefore took a hit on both employers' and employees' NI. This is a direct result of separate NI classes that are set up explicitly to be different for self-employed people, and these rates don't seem to have changed from what I've seen so far.

Now, you can take your own view on whether this reduction in NI contributions is justified. The self-employed are contributing at lower NI rates, pure and simple. On the other hand, they also get no paid time off, they do have to pay for any resources they need for their job, they don't have the job security and other employment rights of a regular employee, and in terms of the national economy they provide a big advantage over a purely static workforce. Anyone who actually works that way will probably tell you that a modest saving in NI contributions is nowhere near making up for the other overheads, but any way you look at it, this economic and ethical issue has nothing to do with being paid via a limited company, because there is no limited company involved.

On the other hand, if you have enough skills and willingness to work independently and you also want to grow your business beyond yourself or maybe your immediate family, you do realistically need to form a limited company in most cases. Otherwise it's difficult to go after larger deals, take on larger numbers of employees, file proper accounts, and generally run a normal business. After this budget, doing that means you are immediately going to be double-taxed on any income you receive via the company instead of personally. (The previous position was that technically you were double-taxed, but in practice you automatically received a tax credit that exactly or very closely cancelled out the doubled-up portion.)  It's a totally unexpected change that is going to dramatically increase taxation for hundreds of thousands, possibly even millions, of the people most likely to actually help the national economy grow by starting or developing small businesses.

How that makes any sense, even if you don't like the NI implications of working independently, I don't really know. If the Chancellor wanted to bypass all the debate about things like IR35 and disguised employment by treating everyone as an employee for tax purposes, it seems to me it would have made more sense to straight-up merge income tax and NI, declare all income including from dividends to be part of the same total, and then drop corporation tax rates significantly to compensate. If your customer pays you the same amount for the same job, you would wind up with the same bottom line in your bank account after all taxes are applied, whether you receive the money via a limited company or directly. This seems like quite a Tory-style policy: small businesses roughly break even out of it, but it encourages more investment from larger firms given the favourable tax environment it creates in the UK.",null,0,null,1436384285,null,0,false,0,cswjpre,null,t3_3cj69e,null,t1_cswjpre,null,t1_csw86zp,null,null,null,1437693407,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

If it's self-employed (and paying self-employed NI) vs. limited company (and now being double-taxed to a degree on dividends) then maybe they work out quite similar.

If it's the previous system for limited companies (where you probably wouldn't pay as much NI but you also wouldn't be double-taxed in many cases) vs. the new one (where you're always double-taxed unless you have very low dividend levels) then rates now appear to be 7.5% higher for almost everyone (edit: though to be fair the £5k allowance presumably cancels out part of that loss).

Of course the theory might be that limited companies will just factor that increased overhead into what they charge their clients, but the economic implications of making that sort of change across such a large sector of the economy aren't obvious.

This absolutely disgusts me.  
I get that they don't want people to go straight into claiming benefits and get used to it, but I think it's down-right prejudice.  

I was in care, and left ""home"" at 16. Even then, the benefits I could claim were almost non-existent. I got a job almost immediately, but through no fault of my own, I lost my job.
Luckily, I got some housing benefit, but not much else, without that, I would have had no hope.   

They say that people should stay at home with their parents.  
There are lots of people that can't stay at home, or really don't want to for a variety of reasons, they may not have the support that those in a nuclear family might. Do they really think that everyone has a solid family background???  

I am now 30 odd years older, but think the situation is only gettting worse for young people.

No politician expects that, and you're severely misguided about the student loans system if you think so. Student loans end up being a tax on the highest-earning graduates rather than the poorest most disadvantaged children.

&gt; The loan gets written off 25 years after you are eligible to start the repayments(2007 onwards) so there's no chance a student would sit under £21,000 and never pay it back.

I'm not flat out wrong there at all. You aren't required to start paying your student loan until you reach a certain income, then it's paid like PAYE.

Yes, no paperwork is required for a tenancy to exist.

&gt; Can we not terminate the contract for this reason?

If you've moved in, the only way to terminate the tenancy is either a court order, mutual agreement between you and the landlord or either party serving correct notice.

If you sign the tenancy agreement and move in a tenancy will have been created. If one of the guarantors has not responded by the time the tenancy starts then they will not be a guarantor for the duration of the tenancy. If the letting agent is pushing you to sign even if the guarantor is not in place, that's on them.

If you sign the tenancy agreement and do not move in no tenancy will exist but you will have created a contract with the intention of creating a tenancy, if you subsequently don't take this up through your own action/inaction then the agent would be able to take you to court for costs (very unlikely though) If you don't move in because they don't let you as they're not happy with the guarantor paperwork, then they're possibly liable - it would possibly depend on if their guarantor checks and referencing was deliberately vague.

Once you've actually moved in and signed a tenancy agreement you can safely ignore anything else they might throw at you.

That is racism. Plain and simple. That is where these policies largely come from UKIP. Whether or not their policies make sense, their rhetoric is based around their fear of other cultures.

Also note the Guardian has been rather quiet on all the huge strides the government has done on tax evasion, avoidance and aggressive tax planning. It simply doesn't fit their narrative of ""evil rich Tory's scratching each others backs"".

Not to mention the new 8% tax on bank profits.

To quote George Osborn:

&gt; ...""I turn now to combating to tax evasion, avoidance and aggressive tax planning ... we inherited a system where bankers boasted about paying lower tax rates than their cleaners and some multinationals shifted all of their profits offshore... we have stopped these blantent abuses ... but we promised the people we would do more and find a further £5 billion a year, and we have done so. 

&gt; We are boosting HMRC's capacity with a further £750 million investment to go after tax fraud, offshore trusts and the businesses of the hidden economy, tripling the number of wealthy evaders they pursue for prosecution and raising £7.2 billion in extra tax ... we will change the law to stop the use of losses [offsetting tax against them] which abuse our controlled foreign companies regime and ensure that investment fund managers pay the full capital gains tax rate on their carried interest ...

&gt; We will stop corporates artificially increasing the value of stock for tax purposes and to focus the employment allowance on employment, we're restricting it so that companies where the director is the sole employee will no longer be able to claim ... 

&gt; We're consulting on new rules to curb the abuse around disguised employment when working through a personal service company and we are going to add tough new penalties to our General Anti-Abuse Rule as well as name and shame serial users of failed avoidance schemes ...

&gt; these people should have nowhere to hide""

&gt; There are some fundamental unfairnesses in the non-dom regime that I am putting a stop to, today ... I am today abolishing permanent Non dom tax status ... anyone resident in the UK for 15 in the last 20 years will pay full UK taxes on their worldwide income.

Ask the chancellor. Almost certainly because too many people would want to take out the full loan. I'd much rather him keep it as is though than cut the amount of money going to the poorest students to make it equal for everyone for some ideological point.


&gt;And why the fuck would you want to do that, it doesn't matter if their parents are fucking millionaires, the last thing you want to be doing is encouraging people to go to university, because those are the people who go because they want to party and get a degree in potato studies (or whatever), because fuck it, why not?


That is entirely not the case. Taking on a university course really limits your ability to work by virtue of having a massive chunk of your time taken out by your studies. This means (if you can find a job that will adapt to your crazy schedule at all) you need to weigh up if you can actually survive on the money you will earn. This is where the grant comes in. It is **meant** to encourage poorer students to go to university, because although it is a strangely unpopular view in this sub, getting a degree makes you hugely more employable and is a financially smart move when you consider around 3k a year for three or four years is infinitely smaller than the tax lost of future earnings.

null,false,googlyeyespy,null,null,null,"&gt;Osborne's ""living wage"" is instead pegged to the level at which he was until recently measuring child poverty. It's literally a poverty wage.

Firstly, poverty used to be a relative term rather than actually describing living below a basic standard. The poverty line is set as 60% of median income, i.e. £12,480 annually. So that seems like quite a rhetorical term to use, I don't know if you were it's bad that some people have to live on that amount of money (I mean it probably is to be fair, it's not exactly what people think of when they hear 'poverty').

Secondly, the annual living wage in full-time employment at £7.20 is around £15,000. And at £9.00, £19,000. These are both substantially above the old markers for the poverty wage. I don't know all the tax credits that have been removed (can you give more info on this?), but they must be some pretty massive cuts, especially given that the personal allowance is being progressively increased as well as minimum wage.

Edit: just came across this and thought you'd be interested by it - whilst individuals on the living wage come off better than before after tax credits, it seems households with multiple children need to be earning around £32,000 before they see a benefit, and below that will see a loss.

If I went under this system, I'd have £8k a year, that's not a lot, but it's enough to live and lets you concentrate on studying.

Realistically, we can bitch and moan about getting loans instead of free stuff all day, and yes I think the way it was handeled was incredibly unfair, and we obviously CAN afford free tuition, what we mean is that we would rather spend the money on other stuff. But if you want to go to university, not being able to actually afford to live whilst you are there is a MUCH bigger deterrent than making some small repayments when you can afford it.

The maybe most important player who was to improve the first XI was Adam Lallana, and he immediately got injured and didn't get a good run of games until far into the season. This, together with the fact that all our strikers were underperforming/ bad, and that there were a lot of new players, made it hard for Rodgers to find a formation and an XI. It isn't just about having the best players, you have to find a way to get them to play well together as well.

Everyone is going to be talking about the good because we already knew about the bad. 

This is why I am disappointed in Farron and the main Lib Dem website for immediately attacking the budget. While the public will be focusing on the minimum wage increase and personal allowance increase, our party will be attacking the budget as a bad thing, there will be a massive disconnect and it will damage us. 

Osborne has taken away our easy PR attack, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be vocal about the utterly terrible bits of the budget. We should be clear we support the progressive parts such as the dividends tax and clear we oppose the parts which hurt the vulnerable.

My point however is that the majority of under 25's who complain that the living wage doesn't apply to them should take more interest in politics to have influence, and are actually more likely to be employed given the choice of under and over 25's where the living wage applies and money is the deciding factor.

For the first time in recent history the skills and qualifications of the under 25's do not exceed those of the over 50's.  The nation is aging, degrees hold less real world value than ever, the lower wage for under 25's offers an advantage to under 25's where currently one doesn't exist.

Many low skilled jobs would prefer to hire young people because it's cheaper for them and age/skill level is irrelevant to the job. If you were suddenly to remove this young age advantage to the employer, then they could be indifferent to who they employ. But in reality, they would probably hire older people who have had at least some experience.

But this is the reality for a lot of people who use loans and do not get grants! Basically means testing is stupid, it makes too many assumptions about people's situations and free cash. Additionally a lot of people I know who not grants did so because their parent's wealth was entirely in businesses and so their wages were low, either that or they were retired. Compare those people to a family earning £50k with two kids at uni a mortgage on a house in the south east and 2 cars to run and an elderly relative to support (and that's assuming the parents ever *want* to give their money to their kids education) and its obvious this a terrible way to judge how grants are distributed.

If we are going to have grants, they should be based on academic achievement, not some arbitrary metric about your parent's supposed wealth.

I don't think you understand that practically every country in the world has some sort of grading in this way for financial assistance. It is essential to ensure the poorest students get the most help, having a universally equal system would inevitably cut the amount of aid given to the poorest students.


Of course there are examples of why it doesn't work in every case, nothing ever does, it doesn't mean you cut off your nose to spite your face. You should still prioritise those we can factually prove are the poorest because we can actually guarantee that they cannot afford university and by doing that we are helping far, far more people than by removing the banding of financial aid.

&gt; A pejorative term for an individual who repeatedly and vehemently engages in arguments on social justice on the Internet, often in a shallow or not well-thought-out way, for the purpose of raising their own personal reputation. 

Which broadly fits my own definition of the issue here: individuals who engage in critical debates on issues where there need not be an issue. The solution in this case is ridiculously simple and both bus driver and woman (no matter how wrong she was, yes I agree she shouldn't have parked there) could have gone happily about their days without any need for shitty filmed-on-a-mobile slanging matches. 

How happier both would most likely have been. 

But here everyone is, up on their high horses about the issue like she stamps on kittens or something. She parked in a dumb spot - so easy to fix so that everyone can get on with their days.
