null,false,wherearemyfeet,null,null,null,"If the contracts were a whole shiny pound more than what had been contracted for the past 20 years, it'd technically be ""the biggest in history"". However in reality, it represents a WHOPPING 0.6% of the NHS budget. So not even a square 1%.

So to suggest this is indicative of privatisation and that we're teetering on the edge of private companies running the health service is hyperbolic nonsense. 

As to *why* that's ok? Well frankly you've not explained why it *isn't* ok. As far as I'm concerned, I want the NHS to execute projects as effectively and efficiently as possible. That criteria may apply to timescale, it may apply to overall cost, it may apply to ownership of maintenance. Whatever it is, I want to see the *best use* of taxpayer money. If that means giving sporadic yet essential projects to private companies so the NHS can deal with its core mission, then that's the best deal for everyone. 

Insisting the NHS diverts resources away and tries to juggle these projects itself internally because of some ideological outlook of keeping NHS money internal regardless of whether it would be more costly, whether they even have the expertise to do it in the first place (it's more costly to hire, train and retain a full project management team to do occasional projects than to hire a firm as-and-when), or whether doing so will damage their core work of healthcare is short-sighted, to put it mildly.

&gt;If one person loses their job for a silly comment, that's censorship. If another person loses their job for a different silly comment, that's not censorship, because it's hate speech.

They are not both ""silly comments"". Tim Hunt's quip was a silly comment, I agree with you that far. Bahar's actions were not just a silly remark though. You're lying by omission there. Look at these two scenarios, for illustration:

1. Bahar actually, physically separated white men from an event she organised. Sure, the hashtag tweet might be a satirical joke, on some level, but when she is actually judging, managing, *affecting peoples lives* with her racism and sexism, when she's supposed to be the *very officer discouraging that*, she absolutely does not deserve her position. She hasn't just made a joke, she has actually caused racial and sexual segregation and oppression, directly, with her actions. Has Tim done this? Have women *really* been driven out of science with his quip?

2. Ask yourself this, how would a Stormfront-backed #killallniggers go? *""Apparently, everyone thinks we're racist so we're going to satirise that with a new hashtag. #killallniggers!""*. Funny joke, huh? Good satire? Because, you see, the joke is that they aren't *actually* racist, that's just a joke, and when they organise events, and exclude black people, well, forget about that, because the twitter hashtag is just a joke! Tim Hunt though, right? He also sets up events where he explicitly excludes women. Right?

A person being taught means another person needs to spend their time teaching them. They need to use up resources, *stuff*,  to teach them as well. Whilst that person is learning, and not working, they are not using their labour to produce or serve things that people want.

If that person dies before being able to work, it is an inescapable cost of time and stuff, which are real things. It is an economic cost regardless of political, economic, fiscal, or monetary allegiance. 

If the value of time and stuff saved by letting them die is less than the value that would be produced by keeping them alive, it is a systemic failure in real terms. Again regardless of money system.

The monetary system is a different thing to the economic system, and the economic system is a different thing to the real economy, and to society.

For a peace of mind, an equity release plan will generally only be repayable on death or when your gran moves out into long term care, i.e. she can no longer live in the property. So there is no immediate worries that it will impact on her ability to remain in the property. 

* How have they managed to take out an equity release plan without informing your gran? Is your Gran the outright / sole  owner of the property? 

* Does it have a no negative equity guarantee? Most new equity plans will now offer this, especially if they are part of the [Safe Home Income Plans (Equity Release Council)](http://www.hodgelifetime.com/equity_release_safeguards.html). If so if the debt exceeds the value of the house, there will be no liability to pay beyond the value of the house. 

&gt; I'm very angry that my Mum and Auntie seemed to have sold the house to the bank for about £20,000

Depending on the extent of the repairs, it may have been a necessity if your family had no other options to raise capital and wanted for your gran to remain in her home.

Van Ginkel is also vastly better than Ake.

A handful of 1995 born central defenders are way better than Ake, namely Niklas Süle and Tin Jedvaj.

James Nursey always used to be reliable, but the Mirror have dropped a few clangers with their Villa stories in the past year or so. A lot of the national papers rely on their locally-based reporters, so stories that tend to come from club sources would be reported across a few of them. The Birmingham Mail you would expect to be best positioned for exclusives, but they have a hot/cold relationship with the club and these days most of their transfer stories tend to be quoting their 'sister paper' the Daily Mirror, or just reporting other transfer rumours from elsewhere. Same goes for the Express &amp; Star really, not seen them pull an exclusive out of the bag for a while. The Mail does do a good job of confirming or dismissing some stories though. 


There have been some changes behind the scenes media wise at the club, so don't know if that's affected where the local media are getting their information, but it seems Sky Sports generally are the first to report done deals.

&gt; It isn't irrelevant. Even an academy as good as Barcelona's, one that produced Xavi, Iniesta, Messi, Busquets, etc. has been unable to produce a player good enough for their first team since 2008.

You talk about dislodging 4 of the best players in the world. Your argument holds no weight when you see players like Thiago leave, because they can't cement themselves.

That said, I'd be over the fucking moon if we produced just one of those, let alone a bunch.

&gt; We are striving to have players as good as those players, and expecting them to frequently come through our academy is unrealistic.

I did not say I expect them to frequently come through, or be world beaters. I said I'd prefer to see youth being given a chance over players like Salah, who are brought in as backups and shipped out the following summer.

&gt; The fact of the matter is that our youth simply aren't good enough in most cases to even be backup to the first team.

That is your opinion.

&gt;  but if we're talking about saying that we shouldn't sign a player like Remy or Falcao for backup because we should rely on Solanke or Bamford (although he isn't an academy product) is farcical.

I did not say this.

you said: ""I said I'd prefer to give our youth a chance over signing back up players""

I said: ""You always hear about title winning teams having ""strength in depth"", and having a bench full of kids is the opposite of that, however good they are at youth level.""

you said: ""Our youth is brilliant, and probably the best in the country.""

I said that that's probably true, but being the best young players in the country doesn't mean you are good enough to be backup for Chelsea. 

&gt;You talk about dislodging 4 of the best players in the world. Your argument holds no weight when you see players like Thiago leave, because they can't cement themselves.
That said, I'd be over the fucking moon if we produced just one of those, let alone a bunch.

I'm not talking about dislodging those players, I'm talking about producing them, and how incredibly rare it is, and how even the very very best academies in the world rarely produce top class talent good enough for Barcelona and Chelsea. 

You mention Thiago, and fair enough that is an example of a player who has graduated form La Masia since 2008 that would be good enough to play for Chelsea, now [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Masia#Alumni) is a list of their other Alumni - try and find the other players that are good enough for Chelsea since 2008. I count only Icardi.

&gt;I did not say I expect them to frequently come through, or be world beaters. I said I'd prefer to see youth being given a chance over players like Salah, who are brought in as backups and shipped out the following summer.

That's a reasonable enough opinion to have, I just feel like you're asking too much. If young players as good as Salah (a player being coveted by the top Italian teams with Champions League experience) cannot succeed at Chelsea, then what chance does Izzy Brown? I would say not all that much. I would be a lot more confident with Salash coming off the bench in a big game to try and make an impact than Izzy Brown or another youth player like him. 

&gt;That is your opinion.

Yeah it's my opinion, but it is founded by looking at other academies and the lack of players they produce good enough to be backup at a top club. United's top prospects in recent years are Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and D. Welbz - I do not believe that those players are good enough for our bench. 

So what youth players are you talking about? you said you don't want us to buy short-term backup and to promote youth instead, so where are these players you want to promote? you said that our youth are the best in the country, so which players specifically do you want as backup over Falcao who will was brought in as backup and will be shipped out the following summer. (notice me quoting things you have said, so do not accuse me of ignoring your points entirely).

We sold Sturridge because we wanted to play him as a winger and he wanted to be a striker. in all honestly i'll admit that selling Sturridge was a mistake and we should have kept faith and told Torres to fuck off. Rooney probably would, yeah. 

&gt;I did not say this. 

What else does:
&gt;""*but only if they're actually good enough*
&gt;&gt;Our youth is brilliant, and probably the best in the country."" 

mean?

Me: ""If we [integrate] an academy player every year or 2 then great, but only if they're actually good enough [For Chelsea]""

You: ""Our youth is brilliant, and probably the best in the country.""

Me: ""Being one of the best young players in England doesn't mean you are good enough for Chelsea""

A hydraulic press can't repair itself, that takes knowledge which only a human can acquire. We replace our muscles with machines, and in turn create more jobs for our brains. 

But computers are different, because they replace our brains. We make a computer to replace the jobs our brains were previously doing. These computers lead to the creation of new jobs, just as before. Except now there's a difference, because these new jobs don't necessarily have to be done by humans either. Why have humans fixing bugs in the code when we have software that can write itself, find bugs in other software and fix them? 

The coming revolution is not going to create jobs for humans. It's going to create lots of new work that we never would've thought of before. Entire industries will be created that we couldn't dream of. But when we have machines to replace our muscle, and computers to replace our brains, why on earth would humans get the new jobs? 

Humans aren't special, that is the top and bottom of it. Given enough time, we will find a way to replicate everything our brains are capable of through computers. And when that happens, there will be no more reason to employ humans in anything.

So cast your mind back to that night. Marr is commenting on one thing only - that there had been a widespread predictions  that Iraq's well trained disciplined army would defend Baghdad adamantly,   inflicting large scale casualties.

I very much dislike the use of the word patriarchy in conversations such as these.

Nowadays, it's the remains of that and there are in my eyes, in the west, no large attempts to prevent women from positions of power. Rather, there are attempts to prevent *anyone* else from positions of wealth and power as naturally those who have power seek to maintain and extend it.

I agree that in theory, a better squad should help maximise your points return. But that wasn't the case in 2013-14 for us, or in 2009-10 for Spurs, or in 2011-12 for Spurs (and almost Newcastle). 

Even this past season - we buy Remy or Bony instead of Balotelli, we finish top four, no doubt. Suddenly United are wondering how a squad with such high-profile attacking talents as Rooney, Di Maria, Van Persie, Falcao, and Mata - who, collectively, let's be honest, underperformed last season - can't pick up points against the teams they're meant to beat.

He kept things intentionally vague with the TA saga and alluded to Kono being the target and even had another friend chime in and flat out call Kono to Spurs (Muzzi giving a vague but positive response to it)....with TA he called it publicly after Sky and the papers started saying we were close to completing it.

I personally think he is a essentially a paid WUM who will back up his vague calling of TA and Payet deals being to give some credence to what he is doing while at the same time putting a fair amount of crap out there as well.

Di Marzio himself can be reliable....but ever since he launched his own website there is a fair amount of shit that comes out that is linked to his name by the other writers for his site.  Di Marzio seems to now sit back a bit and only comment on deals when they are much closer and less likely to have fallen apart.

I personally think paying attention to some of the trends of the stories is a better indication of what is going to happen.

So basically what you're doing is calling someone who sucks at arguing a point a mansplainer. If I think you suck at this (I don't, just a hypothetical) can I call you a womansplainer? What about when it's about men's rights? Do you see how extremely inflammatory and counter-productive that is? There's no need to come up with a gendered insult. Ironically that is the sort of thing that is sexist - by definition - and directly contributing towards enhancing the gap between the sexes.

&gt;he dismissed emotionality as worthless, that's mansplaining

Emotions are important but should not play a part in serious discourse. That's a fallacy called the appeal to emotion.

&gt;It's patronising

As is the word mansplaining. I haven't had it levelled at me and yet I already feel that feminists feel my opinion to be worth less than theirs.

&gt;It is a product of, and fuel for, unexamined patriarchy. Any man who engages in mansplaining in a feminist setting in particular has failed to examine the biases he has started with. He has assumed he's above all that and thus better than other people (since they all have biases) - included biases given to him as a result of **patriarchal background noise in society**.

Please be *very* specific about the bit I've bolded. I'm curious.

&gt;By the way, lots of terms are used in a derogatory manner. That doesn't mean they're not useful when used correctly.

Sure. But when was the last time you ever accepted a derogatory term that was gender-biased? Oh right, because it's about a man and not a woman it's okay.

null,false,SuperSeriousUserName,null,null,null,"&gt;Thanks for the reply. I'm gathering you work for the NHS in some capacity?

Indeed, I'm one of those much-hated NHS managers :) even in Dorset a little while ago!

&gt;The communication problems I can appreciate are an enormous undertaking, the scale of such a project is unimaginable. I just cannot believe it wasn't implemented decades ago to allow it to grow organically with the organisation.

It's mostly that the NHS is really heavily silo'ed. Departments within hospitals don't communicate well, and organisations are even worse at it (eg hospital -&gt; GP). Part of this is because the NHS is quite slow to adopt new technology outside of the treatments themselves, so channels of communication are pretty unsophisticated. That's not an excuse, though.

&gt;As I said I have had many more problem experiences with the NHS, some of them ridiculously ""grass roots""; for example I had a test at my local GP surgery on Friday and was promised a call back from the nurse after she saw the doctor... Nope, she went home instead.

Yeah that sucks. My advice would be to politely complain via the PALS service at your local CCG. Patient feedback is taken super seriously, both at hospitals and CCGs.

&gt;And likewise my girlfriend has had about 9 blood tests in the last year and not once did she receive a phone call from anyone explaining why, just calls from the receptionists telling her to have another. 

Again, that sucks, and again, I'd suggest PALS. 

&gt;Anyway, I'm ranting now and I'm making my family sound like the most unwell group of people in the UK!

He's lost his drive going forward and his ability to get back to recover from opposition counter attacks that he had 2 seasons ago. He got exposed time and time again against pace last season. His touch is still good, along with positioning and overall defending, but against a skillful, quick winger he's lost his edge. 

Clyne obviously doesn't have his experience, but his touch is as good, younger and fresher means he has a higher ceiling and you're playing him for both now and the future, along with the fact that he offers more going forward in any team bar City, who are re-known for sitting on the edge of the opponents box keeping possession, with slow probing attacks into the penalty box. This covers up Zabaletta's declining agility.

For me personally I think City'd start Clyne. Younger, hungry, English.

****

So if I'm honest, I think Rodgers has the potential to be better than all but Mourinho in the PL. Managers get better from their experiences as a player, then usually as a coach, until they become a manager. They absorb all their experiences and it makes them a better manager over time. 

Rodgers hasnt done this. He still doesn't do this. Things clearly don't work, and he continues to do it. He's made severely bad tactically decisions at severely un-opportune times. The decision to start Lallana as a lone forward against Stoke is legitimately impossible to defend.

My point is that he's coping a lot of stick at the moment, but he's a young manager who's achieved alot very quickly. It's important that, just like a young player, we allow him to become better, and not put pressure on him as soon as he stumbles.

I know its unpopular, but he's the best shot we've had of a long term British manager in many seasons. We hired potential in him, not instant results. The club clearly see him as the manager going forward.

So I think he might prove better than the other managers bar Mourinho, but hopefully for his sake he starts to show that soon, or else I feel the fan pressure will be too much on FSG to keep him.

(sorry bout the essay, couldn't stop typing till I'd finished)

**TL;DR** Zaba's getting on. Lost his legs last season. Clyne's younger, a better option for the future, and is English. Clyne gets the nod for me if he were at City.

Rodgers had the potential to be better than all but Mourinho imo. Needs to gain some more experience and actually apply that experience to his management going forward.

&gt;*Yeah, exactly but if a multinational can just have one set of European laws to abide by and not 27 different ones that will be easier.*

That's the problem. The EU only serves to lobby big business. They push competition out for monopoly, give them tax breaks of their choosing and regulate allowing only one line of industry. What about our small business?

&gt;&gt;*That isn't really a barrier. It provides a market in both education and translation.*

&gt;*That's the broken window fallacy. The resources wasted on an unnecessary communication problem could be better spent elsewhere.*

It isn't wasted though. If people like spending money on learning a language, they should, it goes into the economy.

&gt;I understand the cultural attraction of languages, but I think the education in and use of English (which is _de facto_ the language of modern business) should be greatly improved throughout Europe.

I wouldn't go to France if it was just a hairier England. Cultures shouldn't be watered. They're *the* sexy that creates tourism. English is already taught greatly on a global basis anyway. Being in the EU in no way helps that.

&gt;&gt;*How? 0.o*

&gt;*Freedom of movement makes us wealthier for the same reason that free trade does (indeed one would argue that it is a vital part of free trade) - **it allows the market to allocate labour resource efficiently.***

No it doesn't. It isn't like we're in shortage. It displaces labour, compresses wages, drains skill and stresses public services. Unless controlled. We shouldn't take bullets till our limbs fall off. We should tackle what's sending people away. Improve education and infrastructure without infringing on our citizen's welfare. The unrestricted movement of labour is really quite, unknowingly, selfish.

&gt;*Basically it means if you can get a better job somewhere - you are free to do so, without the heavy hand of government and protectionists preventing you.*

Any consequences to that? Maybe not so much being a Brit going to other places.

&gt;*It is very difficult to harmonise regulations without political union*

It isn't. Why not just a free market?

&gt;*as legislation is inevitably a political matter*

No it isn't. Economic agreements and/or regulation (which should be minimal and just about security) doesn't need to dictate how we run our courts, spend our money or do, or more appropriately not do, business elsewhere. Being in the EU locks our trade inside a minority.

But seriously though, right now if I were to make a premier league side I would take Zabaletta. But if you asked me to make a purchase, I would take Clyne because the season after next he will be better.

That's a pretty bold claim on Rodgers btw, Mourinho (in my eyes anyway) is the best manager on the planet in terms of winning trophies. I would like Rodgers to be as good but I'm not sure if he has the charisma and mind games to compete in that sense. Tactically he is still experimenting as there are a lot of new players coming in from different systems and he may find the perfect system for everyone. But I don't think he'll ever win as much as Mourinho.

- Go to GP - ""i'm going to kill myself if you let me leave"" - given prescription of prozac - month's worth - and sent on my way.

- In the next two days I see my GP once more and A&amp;E twice more, saying the same thing. Both times am not taken seriously and told to contact my GP. My GP told me to go to A&amp;E.

- After being sent home from A&amp;E the second time - obviously take the prozac all at once with other things. Taken to hospital, discharged from all MH services. 

- After 9 months of waiting for a referral to therapy - try it again. Discharged that day with promise of speedy referral.

- 5 MONTHS later, given 6 sessions of CBT, then go back to the bottom of the list again.

How is - 4 A&amp;E visits, countless GP visits, treatment for poisons, other treatment, 2 overnight stays, 2 Ambulances and 6 sessions of CBT a cost effective way of dealing with an illness. 

This is in total opposition to when I was diagnosed with a serious heart condition - from ""my heart feels weird can you listen"" to open heart surgery in no time! But I hate all this circlejerking in the UK about the NHS. Almost any health system in europe would have done exactly the same with the heart thing, and probably it would have cost me next to nothing. As for the mental health services, I would gladly pay £150 out of my wages per month like in Germany to actually get healthcare. I've used my EHIC over here and the service I received - not for mental health services, my ear was bleeding all over the place - was shockingly good. I thought living in a country without the NHS would make a lower standard of care but: the hospital was clean, I was seen at the (non-emergency) clinic in less than an hour, the magazines were up to date, the doctor was helpful, I paid about £3 for the prescription, and got seen later the same week. For free. Paid for by the NHS but the same standard of care as someone with German Health Insurance.

Sorry for the massive post, guess I had more to say than I thought!

Big business is successful small business. I choose to shop from Amazon because it is an excellent company, if a small company wants to compete they need to deliver a comparable service. SME's get far more tax breaks than the 'big business' scapegoats.

The language issue is the broken window fallacy. If I have to spend resources ensuring my staff learn languages in order to be able to do business then that is resource that I can't spend on other areas. I'm not saying we should ban people from learning languages, but we should foster a common language in the EU (and English is _de facto_ the language of international business) in order to make commerce easier and thus everyone wealthier. The EU provides a means to encourage this to happen much faster.

The free movement of labour means people can move where the demand is - so if there is a shortage of programmers in London then Eastern European programmers can move there to get a higher wage and vice versa (there are tech hubs throughout Europe). 

The only people that get hurt are those who are not economically viable in the labour market (usually due to poor skills) but the alternative is to make everyone's goods and services artifically more expensive to protect these people - it is pure protectionism.

The EU gives us better bargaining power as a larger bloc has more clout in any agreement because if we walk away then they lose a huge market.

The EU is by no means perfect though and some aspects of it do harm free trade (you highlighted a lack of free trade agreements with other zones) but treaties like TTIP etc. are fixing this.

BBC as an international entity sell British television abroad, that includes tv not made by the BBC. The British Broadcasting Corporation is funded by a mandatory (if you own a television) TV license that pays for various radio, tv and internet services. The BBC's two 'flagship' channels BBC1 and BBC2 were available on terrestrial (analogue signal sent by air received by antenna and recently switched off in most places) BBC3 and BBC4, CBBC and CBeebies were added when the digital service 'freeview' a set of approx 60-80 free to watch channels  depending on where you are.

We did have 'big 4 (or 5 after about 1999)' channels (BBC1, BBC2, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5) Which were all transmitted via analogue signal, although many people could not watch channel five without a strange man coming to their house to do some witchcraft to their video player. ITV (or Independent Television,) is funded by advertising as is Channel 4 although they have very different ethoses and both now have a large range of other channels available on the digital freeview service. (ITV2, ITV3, ITVBe, CITV, More4, E4, etc etc) This would be the most direct comparison to your ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC competition. 

Withing the Beeb- BBC1 historically has the programming made by the BBC with the biggest budgets or the biggest fanbases, programmes that have done particularly well graduate from the subsidiary channels to BBC1, i.e the great british bakeoff did so well it was moved to BBC1 from BBC2, which tends to have a bigger audience share. The different BBc channels will also commision different types of programming BBC3 was aimed at the 17-24 demographic I believe, so they obtained the licensing for Family Guy, American Dad and a few other imports and make lots and lots of reality TV focussing on issues like relationships, body image, sex and parents. BBC3  mainly competes with E4- the channel four's 'youth' channel. BBC4 commision arts/ culture programming. BBC2 is an odd mix of music, sport and comedy, programmes that could be found on the other channels but have enough of a market to be shown on one of the original channels (and more familiar to the pre digital TV market)

null,false,AnalyticContinuation,null,null,null,"The whole concept of a ""job"" is fairly new though. Go back a few centuries and most people would have a trade, probably passed down the family line. They would expect to have to look for business rather than just turn up and be told what to do. The idea of a ""job"" with a guaranteed weekly wage regardless of the current success of the company you worked for, and the idea of being ""unemployed"" if you can't find a job is quite new.

However the shift away again has already started. In the mid-20th-century you could get a ""job for life"". You'd join after school or university and work your way up working for the same company for your whole working life. Now that is quite rare. People either actively switch jobs to build a ""career"" or they find that they are made redundant and possibly the company they worked for ceases to even exist quite frequently.

What seems to be happening is that people are developing more than one source of income - perhaps through Ebay. If the unskilled are going to be pushed towards ""zero hour contracts"" then the next reasonable development is that in return they should have the right to hold multiple such jobs simultaneously and be able to accept or decline hours offered on a daily or weekly basis. That would give them back some negotiating power but would be a major shift in thinking for many people.

Maybe it won't happen like that. Perhaps something different will emerge. But a ""job"" or ""employment"" for people is the whole point of existing at all. I don't mean that people should expect to spend their lives doing drudge work for someone else, but that the reason to exist is to contribute (in the loosest possible sense) and interact with others. It is a mutual virtuous circle. You can't take some large fraction of the population out of the equation by replacing their ""jobs"" with machines. Those ""jobs"" are not what defines those people. The ""job"" does not exist in isolation as a thing available to be done by person or machine. Machines do not get paid a salary. So they do not do jobs. If previous roles for people cease to exist then those people now need a new role. If we live in a 'society' then we should (by definition) find new roles for everyone in society. And we do. But sometimes it takes time for things to adjust.

- Cech is better than Migs

- Debuchy and Clyne are similar level, Clyne will likely be better in the future though
- Kosceilny and Mertesacker are just as inconsistent as our own defenders
- Moreno is better attacking wise, Gibbs better defensively, so pretty much the same 

- in midfield, Hendo and Milner vs Cazorla and Wilshere(?). The arsenal pair are more likely to win games but Hendo and Milner are solid players in their own right. So all four are about the same level imo. Meanwhile Ramsey has more influence than Allen. Lucas is probably better than Coquelin, but Coquelin is young.
- Ozil and Sanchez are better than Coutinho and Firmino and in their prime, while Coutinho and Firmino are young and have time to improve. 
- Sterling/Ibe vs Walcott/Ox, I dunno. Pretty even.

- Studge over Giroud probably.

Overall I think Arsenal have a great squad and could surprise the league and mount a challenge for the title, particularly if City don't make some signings soon. The addition of Cech is huge and if they manage to get a prolific striker and keep their players fit for a change, they'll finish at least 2nd imo.

I don't care one way or the other because I don't see that position as our biggest need. I also think people are going overboard with how good the player is. He's good, don't get me wrong, and the partnership with Jan would make them better than the sum of their abilities, but he is not Mats Hummels or some shit. 

I mean none of us have a copy of the contract in our hands, none of us are in the boardrooms listening to how negotiations are going so I don't truly know any more than you. Something about this just seemed fishy to me with the clause in his contract to go to Southampton, and I felt it wouldn't be as easy as everyone was making it. I think Atletico stirred up all this shit to get a bidding war going, but if there's an option to buy in his contract it kind of complicates things.

Take the SNP - they cut NHS spending by a round 2% over the same time that the Tories increased it by 4.4%.  We don't let that get in the way of criticising the Tories for cutting spending that hasn't actually been cut and that isn't targeted at NHS Scotland anyway.  Anecdotally, almost all doctors I ask here can't even name the Scottish Health Secretary, but know who Jeremy Hunt is, so he gets a fair bit of stick for stuff he has no control over.

Then there's the SNP's plan for Scottish independence that involved cutting corporation tax to 3% lower than England's.  They've also slashed council funding (IIRC more than in England) and won't allow councils to raise council tax to make up for the shortfall. As you can see, I'm as centre-right as they come and I can certainly pick quite a few policies I like.  In fact, I've voted for them before.  Then they've got this authoritarian, Labour-like thing going that I hate (like centralising the police to make Police Scotland) and of course their independence thing that I like even less.

In a nutshell, I think the ""Red Tories"" label is emotive and that a charismatic leader (think new Tony Blair) could've stemmed it and pre-empted the disaster up here.

&gt;__Firdaus Square__ ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language): ساحة الفردوس‎; [transliterated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_transliteration): Sahat al-Firdaus), is a public open space in [Baghdad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad), [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq). It is named after the [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language) word *Firdows*, which literally means ""paradise"". The 14th of Ramadan Mosque and two of the best-known hotels in Baghdad, the [Palestine Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Hotel) and the [Sheraton Ishtar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheraton_Ishtar) are located on the square.. The [roundabout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout) in the center of Firdos Square has been the site of several monuments beginning with the completion of the monumental arch *The Unknown Soldier* in 1959. It was subsequently replaced by the statue of [Saddam Hussein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein) [that was torn down by U.S. coalition forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firdos_Square_statue_destruction) during the [invasion of Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq) in 2003. A green, abstract [sculpture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture) by [Bassem Hamad al-Dawiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassem_Hamad_al-Dawiri) was commissioned replace the Saddam statue. In 2009, the architect of the Monument to the Unknown Soldier [Rifat Chadirji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifat_Chadirji) expressed interest in rebuilding the monument on its original site.  As of 2013, the al-Dawiri statue and the surrounding columns have been removed from Firdos Square.

null,false,kopking08,null,null,null,"FFS. Rodgers is, one hundred percent, behind why we were so good. Did he get Luis firing? Yes. Did he have players like Coutinho, bred in the slow as fuck Italian league, pressing? YES.

Everything that made us so scary started with Rodgers. We wouldn't have had half the opportunities on goal that we did without him orchestrating the tactics.

As for our losing the title? I honestly think, as awful as this sounds, that Gerrard's slip both literally and figuratively put us on the nose dive. Then Hendo got a pretty harsh red that had him out the final three games. And after Luis, Hendo was our most important player that season. Not having him there was absolutely, in my mind, the reason we couldn't hang on. We got overrun the rest of the season. 

I think it's tough on Gerrard, but in a lot of moments later in his career with us he succumbed to the weight of the pressure. As a younger lad, certainly he could come in and just by sheer will turn a game. But so much of that bravado was his ability and his energy. Mentally, I think some of us might be able to agree that Carragher was probably the take charge guy in the dressing room. He certainly was on the pitch. 

The only time I've ever seen Stevie be instructive with other players on the field is when he's yelling at a player for a particularly woeful failure. Otherwise it was mostly lead by example.

End of, Rodgers got us within inches of a title. I think you have to expect, on some level, the players to push that extra inch. The idea that we could have beaten Chelsea at their own game of sit back and defend is crazy. You do not change the tactics that had you whooping other top 4 sides just because you know Chelsea will go Iron Curtain. No one is better at Iron Curtain than Mourinho. 

We went for it and, to borrow an American phrase, went down swinging. I give everyone in the club, from Rodgers to Suarez to Gerrard (his quarterback role changed our season) to Hendo to Studge to Coutinho, and on and on, a tremendous amount of credit. They made us dream. We were, by far, the most exciting football club on the planet. 

If you can even think of blaming Rodgers for anything, you are a knob amongst knobs.

Failing to act to distribute money in a timely manner would on the face of it seem to count as a failure in that duty, especially if the money was just sitting around in the meantime uninvested (i.e. if you got the same sum in 2014 that you should've received in 2006).

So it's at least possible that you have a case.  I'm not sure how a court would assess damages but they would probably consider the likely use you would've put the money to.  On the other hand the fact that you took no action for 8 years to force the issue may count against you, but I'd say it's at least worth seeking some specialist advice given the possible sums involved.

This assumes that your mother actually has assets which could be used to pay any judgement - there's no point winning a judgement there's no realistic prospect of collecting.

I was referred to a clinic for treatment last June, and I am still waiting for a first appointment. I asked to be referred to a clinic that was not the nearest to me as that one had a waiting list of over two years, the one I asked for *only* had a waiting list at the time of 12 months. On the downside, it'll be at least a 2 hour journey by train each way when I do get appointments, but I'm fine with that if it shaves a year off my waiting time.

But, people with gender dysphoria are classified as mental health, as due to how NHS time frames work (to my understanding), the same expectations do not apply. It doesn't matter that people with my condition have one of, if not the highest, risk of self-harm and suicide (I believe attempted suicide is around 34% of people with gender dysphoria in the UK). 

Instead, we are asked to wait our turn for clinics that have hardly had an increase in funding even when the number of patients has gone up a lot due to increased awareness.

That said, I still think the NHS does a fantastic job on the whole, especially for people classified as physical health rather than mental.

And for the sake of the argument, let's say you and the other user talking to me right now are right. She's not the companions throughout history but another separate character constantly reborn in each era meant to grow up and eventually save The Doctor at a key moment or watching over him.

That *still* undermines the other companions because now you can look at almost every story that takes place on Earth and sometimes other planets I suppose as one where Clara more than likely influenced the occurrences in The Doctor's favor when he seemingly got ""lucky"" or needed something important at a time to help him.

Moffat made Clara far too important for her own good and all for the sake of one of his creations being ""the most important"" for no reason.

It invalidates a lot of what Tennant and Smith did with the character and pretty much everything Eccleston did.

Anyway, The TARDIS exists across all space and time, and can even archive rooms within itself that haven't been created yet (The Doctor's Wife). I wouldn't be surprised if after Clara Prime gained the TARDIS' trust, that she would be seen as a benevolent entity, not causing alarms. It isn't as though Clara is teleporting onto the TARDIS, but rather becoming part of the facts of those events. Due to the nature of the TARDIS, after the Clara Prime was met, further incarnations were treated the same, even in The Doctor's relative past.

One could even assume that the Clara-manipulated time-stream is manipulated by default (the manipulation is a fact of history, as a fixed point in time), since The First Doctor chose the right TARDIS initially and after Clara's manipulation.

As 12s companion? I mean it's not that they're not good together, but she's just not the companion type anymore. She's focused on settling down, and the doctor just gets in the way of her real goals.

And that's not the bad thing either. It's that she isn't being portrayed that way. They have this mold that companions seem to be fitted into even when they're poor fits for the role. Amy and Rory barely fit the mold, but they shone for a while because they were still committed to it when the time came round. They had lives, but occasionally went with the doctor and loved it. 

What I would have liked better: focus more on Clara's role as a companion, and how THAT role is compromised, as opposed to her regular everyday one. She really isn't clever enough that the doctor can't be in control of his... Pet human at all times. She's no Donna. She's no Martha.

I also don't think Clara took Susan's place.

I simply pointed out that, whether 65dos like it or not, the fact that they applied for and received funding from a government scheme designed to support music and the arts does *precisely* mean that they can be held up as evidence that the government supports music and the arts. That's surely not particularly controversial.

I note now that that quote doesn't seem to appear in the article any longer, so make of that what you will.

In any case, I didn't think much of the article. If they had simply said, ""this funding is helpful but we think the real issue is that arts funding is under attack"", then fine; but instead they wrote a meandering diatribe that seemed to distance themselves from the process (other people applied for it, not us), minimise the value of the funding (apparently the fact it will cover their travel means it's not going towards their tour it's going to oil companies and airlines), indulge in some histrionics about the evil Tories (Dickensian villains or some such slur, ripping the heart out of the country through austerity), and conclude with precisely zero ideas as to what arts funding they would like to see introduced or protected (with the vague exception of keeping community centres open and protecting the welfare state so the arts don't become the preserve of rich kids, something that I don't think has ever happened ever in the history of rock and/or roll).

If all they're saying is that they are grateful for the limited government funding that is on offer and that they've been lucky enough to receive but that they think that more is needed and they want to make that clear, then fine. But they could have done so with far less words and a few more facts.

I know that most companions end up being a big deal.

Rose: Bad Wolf

Donna: The Doctor/Donner

Amy: time/space crack powers and mother of The Doctor's wife(?)

But with Clara, the fact that she's ""special"" has been front and center from the beginning, rather than a end of season development, and it's just been getting worse and worse.

In her first appearance, she's so brilliant that INSANE DALEKS are compelled to make her into a Dalek. Not only that, but this single Dalek is able to erase THE DOCTOR from the memories of all the Daleks in existence. THE DOCTOR!

Then, she's the only person able to break The Doctor out of his post-Amy funk, by saying the word pond. Then, we find out she's two people in different time periods. She's a big mystery, and the Doctor wants to know the answer to her.

Then she shows up again, and her first episode as a real companion is ""The Rings of Akhaten,"" where on the surface it looks like her leaf is more powerful than all of The Doctor's memories. Maybe she could have been the straw that broke the camel's back, but her going on and on about ""infinity possibilities"" it just looks like her leaf is gamebreaking, pretty much because it's her story and she's special.

Then the reveal of the mystery happens and she's retroactively placed into every adventure, making her the super duper, extra special companion, who not only saved the day, but has saved every day in every adventure since forever.

Then, we get her go back to Gallifrey, to when The Doctor was a child. She tells him philosophies of The Doctor, meaning she's pretty much the reason The Doctor IS The Doctor.

It just feels so forced. The companion is supposed to be the audience surrogate, a human friend who is wondered by what she sees and keeps The Doctor grounded to reality.

Instead, I don't see her as a person. I see her as a plot device. I don't like her because I feel like I'm not being allowed to get invested in her at my own pace, but am instead being forced to care about her because ""isn't she so special and mysterious? Don't you want to know what's happening?"" I feel as though I'm being manipulated, and once I recognized that, I had real trouble caring about her.

Her romantic arc with Pink was boring at best and cringy at worst. She lies to The Doctor, for no real reason. She's pulls that shit with the volcano, for a guy she's only known for.. what? A term? 

And her ""control freak"" characterization seems incredibly shallow. Rather than giving her depth, explaining how she became controlling, what events in her life lead her to this personality, instead we get characters saying VERY CLEARLY, VERY OFTEN ""control freak."" It's like they're trying to make it a core part of her personality, and we're supposed to just accept that it is because they tell us.

Did we ever learn WHY she's a control freak? Did she suffer from a childhood trauma where she felt an intense lack of control? Were her childhood friends very relaxed, forcing her to take responsibility and organism things? Were her parents controlling, so it's just how she's been raised? 

Nope, we'll just say it loudly and often and you'll just accept it as part of her character rather than a flaw we pulled out of a hat so people don't call her a Mary Sue.

It's hardly surprising. In a capitalist society, with a right-wing government, people are naturally going to doubt that any official or media criticism of the NHS is being done in good faith, and that any changes are truly being made in the public interest, no matter what arguments are given. Everything that can be presented as a flaw can potentially be used as a justification for anything the government wants to do, and we know that what this government wants is to brutally cut public services.

null,false,BNIUK,null,null,null,"&gt; Turnout is higher in nationalist areas because unionists in nationalist areas are more likely to vote than nationalists in unionist areas.

Whats your source. Do nationalists have a secret agreement?


&gt;Turnout patterns among the age groups also favours unionists at the moment, since the groups over 40 are majority Protestant, and it's a well known fact that the elderly are more likely to vote, but every age group under that is majority Catholic. Eventually we're going to get to the point where the majority of every age group is from a Catholic or nationalist background.


That doesn't explain that since the 90s the unionist vote has been stagnant. It would of changed at least a little  if catholic=nationalist but it has stayed the same. Are you saying 40 year olds don't vote. Between 2001 and 2011 the non roman catholic population went from 45.6% to 41.6%. Yet the unionist vote in 2001 westminster elections was 51.9 and in 2015 it was 50.6%. In 2001 westminster election the nationalist vote was 41.7% yet it fell to 38.4% despite the catholic population increasing its share by .6%. Wheres this demographic change? Whys my united Ireland not here yet?. 


Northern Ireland is becoming more secular and diverse so relying on protestant population=unionist vote and catholic population=nationalist vote meme is useless. The latest census has something much more valuable when it comes to estimating elections. The national identity question. 45% of 0 to 15 year olds call themselves british. Or their parents do but identitiy is more or less inherited here. 31.4% of 0 to 15 year olds call themselves irish. A higher rate of 16 to 24 year olds call themselves irish than 0 to 15 year olds. Ethnic minorities are much more likely to consider themselves british than irish. The same goes for people of no religion. Immigration also needs to be taken into account. 88.7% of catholics are born here compared to 92.9% of protestants being born here. 4.9% of catholics come from outside the uk or roi compared to 1.7% of protestants. How many polish republicans do you know? 

People of protestant heritage are more likely to have no religion than people catholic heritage but they also keep their British identity. [In this map you can see that people of ""no religion"" almost perfectly correlates with people with a british identity. Look at the white mark in west belfast for example](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_Northern_Ireland#/media/File:People_of_no_religion_in_northern_ireland.png) .  [Heres the british identity map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_Northern_Ireland#/media/File:Map_of_predominant_national_identity_in_the_2011_census_in_Northern_Ireland.png). Like i said before. Correlating the protestant/catholic population with elections is useless nowadays and the elections have proven so.

Also it should be remembered, people who hold equity release products are generally old so I can't see them being able to successfully acquiring PPI at a reasonably cheap rate. 

The below is a bit more complicated than the above situation, but you may find it interesting - I'm almost certain OPs case is #1. The below are specifically 'lifetime mortgages', as in OPs case, but there is also a variant of equity release called 'home revision plans'. 

1. Roll up interest, i.e. no repayments at all. No PPI should have been offered. 

2. Interest only repayment, similar to an interest only mortgage. Debt is not repaid, there will be no intention to repay the capital. The provider will then recover the capital debt through property sale proceeds. Possible that PPI may have been offered at one point, but again not relevant in OPs case. 

3. Capital and interest repayment. So the person who takes out the equity release will purchase an annuity that will be enough to cover any regular repayments. Not really that common for equity release products. Again possible PPI taken out.

4. Shared appreciation mortgages. No repayments required, but the provider of the equity release product may offer say 20% of the properties current value, in return for say, 30% of its future value. So the provider will be entitled to a gain 10% of the property value when the lifetime mortgage is eventually sold, plus a further 30% of any property value increase. These are quite rare now, as unsurprisingly, providers have realised that property isn't guaranteed to increase in value! No PPI would be offered here.

Your refusal to accept the difference between a sexist quip, and actual desire for sexist/racist exclusion, are really putting me in a difficult position. I mean, it's like you refuse to accept the logic; the literal, discernible difference between what they did.

What's established is that she wants to stop white men going to certain places, based entirely on their gender and race. Tim clearly doesn't want that with women. Or at least, he hasn't explicitly asked for it, unlike Bahar. If you want to assume the worst in Tim, that's up to you, but guilty until proven innocent is not fair.

How about I pose this question: How far would Bahar have to go beyond what she did in order for you to be convinced that she is on another level to Tim; that she's actually a racist, and a sexist? Or is it that you believe Tim is a sexist, too? Let's say you're right, for a second. Is he a sexist on the same level as Bahar is racist and sexist?

He himself has admitted that he has made mistakes, as everyone does. I still believe he has done a good job, especially considering the circumstances of the past season. 

I still want him to be our manager going forwards, as I believe he is the best man for the job, but that does not mean that we can't criticize his mistakes just as we praise his successes.

All I can say is at least they gave her some kind of actual character arc in the last season, rather than just a mystery that was only a mystery because we didn't have all the pieces of the puzzle until the mystery was revealed. 

The whole about her being selfish - frankly, if I loved someone I would do everything I possibly could to stop them from dying, her actions were a testament to her love for Danny, yes they were selfish but if I was her I would have done the exact same thing, well maybe some things a little differently but the same basic principle. Also, the Doctor's kind of self centered too, he tricked Clara into a situation that he knew was life threatening just because he wanted to have fun. (Mummy on the Orient Express, which was a great episode and not written by Moffat). 

Also like to note, only one of these characters has sacrificed themselves to save the other, and it's Clara in Name of the Doctor, and actually that was her whole arc is that she's saved him a bijillion times and he didn't even realise, so how are you calling her selfish? I'm sorry, it's just the Clara hate is always so bloody one sided, people seem to willfully ignore stuff in order to maintain their hatred of her.

I do agree however that we would have been better off with Oswin, simply because it would be really nice to have the Doctor have a companion who's as smart as him. The closest we've really had to that was Captain Jack and that was 10 YEARS AGO.

Before I had that job, I had the ""Obamacare"" marketplace insurance, the premium was about $240. That insurance was HORRIFIC. They refused to cover almost any prescription (had to order them from Canada, though not much cheaper), refused to give me extra birth control, etc. I also had a deductible of like $6k, so I had to pay out of pocket for so much stuff. I even had to put off surgery, which I still haven't gotten. I have to wait until I get a job that has stable insurance in order to get this necessary procedure. Part of it was because I chose a way cheaper plan, and didn't do my research. But IMO that plan is so terrible it shouldn't even exist.

1. He forms a big part of dispossessing players high up the pitch, ensuring that we're closer to the opposition's goal.
2. He's a very astute passer of the ball, rarely giving it away and almost always making sure it's a positive pass.
3. The lad puts in a fucking SHIFT. He works so so hard to close players down, and either nick the ball or ensure it has to get passed back/sideways.

That being said, I would like him (especially if there is a holding player behind him) to attack the box more consistently, as he does for Wales, and get his goals and assists tally higher. Either that, or I believe that he could actually perform very well as a deep-lying playmaker/defensive midfielder.

&gt; In the spring of 2011, Ms., the Feminist Majority Foundation, and the Women’s Law Project initiated a campaign to change the over-80-year-old definition of “forcible rape” to a broader definition. Using online resources, feminists bombarded the Department of Justice and the FBI with thousands of emails demanding a definition that reflects the realities of rape – vaginal, anal and oral rape, including rape of men – and does not limit lack of consent to physical resistance.

Look; to be honest, I'm not really interested debating the virtues of feminism on Reddit. It's been done. If you have a confirmation bias against it, there's not a lot a discussion will achieve.

If you do sincerely want to learn more about feminism Germaine Greer's done a couple of good lectures at the Sidney opera House which you can find on YouTube [https://youtu.be/H-sXtMZ1xjc]. The interesting thing about Germain Greer is that very few people agree with 100% of what she says and very few people disagree with 100% of what she says so you can find yourself critically evaluating what she says in a very constructive way. Not to mention that even when she speaks on an issue you might not agree with, she explains her position in a way you can easily feel empathic towards her thoughts.

My source is comparing the census with election results, and yes:

&gt;[Religion is still the prime indicator of voting intention.](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/debateni/liam-clarke/message-of-belfast-telegraph-poll-northern-ireland-needs-a-change-in-politics-29595871.html)

Even among the young, educated demographic we have here on reddit, [the overwhelming majority of Catholics are nationalist and the overwhelming majority of Protestants are unionist](http://i.imgur.com/N9Uvjnh.png). And those that don't follow the pattern aren't crossing to the other side, they're voting for the 'non-sectarian' parties.

Also, I wouldn't pin your hopes on the non-religious, if I were you. They split about 50/50 [here](http://i.imgur.com/2lDhZMb.png), and 36/28 (in favour of reunification) in the [Belfast Telegraph's poll](http://www.lucidtalk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BTPollAugust2013-DataReport-130923-PDF.pdf).

The problem unionism has is that it thinks its special. Yes, there are an increasing number of people voting for non-sectarian parties, yes there are people who identify as Northern Irish, yes people are abandoning religion, and yes there are voters crossing the divide and voting for 'the other side'. 

But unionism doesn't have a monopoly on any of those groups. Those people are swing voters. There aren't enough of them to overcome the 'core unionist' vote that would never vote for reunification no matter what, but that core vote is going to shrink over the next few decades to the point where the swing voters have the deciding vote. 

Then it'll come down to who makes the better argument: do we stay in the UK as 'Northern Ireland', a failed state that hasn't had a functioning economy since WW2 and whose budget is subject to the ideological whims of a parliament we have 3% of the vote in; or do we join what is now the fastest growing economy in Europe, where we'd have a third of the vote, and focus on growing an economy so we can pay our own way rather than being reliant on subsidies.",null,0,null,1436130704,null,0,false,0,cst5emh,null,t3_3c3z9p,null,t1_cst5emh,null,t1_cst3ewb,null,null,null,1437612065,null,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3,null

Absolutely consult your family doctor, you are not being silly at all and prescription treatments are the best option for rosacea. Early diagnosis and treatment are links to less severe and less frequent rosacea flares over the lifetime.

There are a few of us here who are rosaceans so you are not alone if you do get a diagnosis, and we will help you as much as we can. Another good sub to subscribe to is /r/rosaceahelp/

I have very recently seen an NHS hospital dermatologist, when nine months ago all I thought I had was a few pimples on the end of my nose and some light flushing! He is doing various blood and urine tests to rule out other conditions that can cause my flushing or sweating issues. So obviously the dermatologist does not think I am being silly and is taking the health of my skin seriously.

Things you can do for yourself in the short term:

- use broad spectrum sunscreen every day even when cloudy or rainy, NICE recommends SPF 30+

- SUPER gentle skincare routine (I have recently posted links to [my blog] (https://onwrinklesandrosacea.wordpress.com/) post on this) 

- clean up your diet and lifestyle. Ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy living, also plenty of foods rich in magnesium and long chain omega-3s. These are oily fish, seeds such as pumpkin and chia, walnuts, bran, cocoa, more oily fish (UK experts recommend up to four servings a week).

It's not a new idea that technology, which has always created more jobs than it destroyed, is now reaching a critical mass and is now destroying more jobs than it creates.

The simple reason is technology, until now, has only ever made physical work easier, it has never been able to replace a thinking human. Now technology is reaching the stage where it viably *can* replace a thinking human, which means no new jobs are created from the destroyed ones.

One idea is that basic income can be funded by taxing companies more. Consider that companies these days spend a lot of revenue paying people to work, but in future computers will do the work and won't be paid.

That money is still coming in, it just isn't going to people as a salary. So we can tax that money and distribute it to people instead.

All you're doing really is making companies pay payroll expenses as tax instead, and giving people benefits from that money. The government is just a middle-man in this transaction, the amount of money moving from company accounts to personal accounts stays the same.

To do it this way you need to tax companies on revenue and not profits, though.

The far-left, of which Corbyn is a long standing figurehead, is heavily tied up in Pro-Palestine, Anti-Israel, Anti-Racism, Anti-Islamophobia causes.

This is the point where they actively campaign for Islamic causes (i.e Respect party) and involve themselves in anti-West Islamic media, i.e. Iran's Press TV. ""Stop The War"" is a coalition of various groups at the heart of this. Corbyn is a founder member and current board member. 

""Uncle Toms"" - ok, not a phrase used other than by the far left on Twitter, but often phrased as ""native informant"" in more formal circumstances.

http://mrpeacemeal.com/yes-ex-muslims-are-native-informants-you-racist/

https://homoeconomicusnet.wordpress.com/2015/06/11/mccarthyism-muslims-and-ex-muslims/

http://i.imgur.com/75c8Z1N.png

The slide shown? That from a talk by Deepa Kumar (shown), Max Blumenthal (remember this name), and Lindsey German, Convenor of Stop the War Coalition. So, Stop The War have no problem saying that ex-Muslims are working with Zionists and White Supremacists to attack Islam and style them all as ""New McCarthyites, a loaded phrase. CAGE were also prominent at that conference (Bath University - IPR - Understanding Conflict) and you may know CAGE from their vocal support of ISIS beheader, Jihadi John.

Many ex-Muslims, Ayran Ali Hirsi, Maryam Namazie or even moderate anti-extremists (Maajid Nawaz) are attacked by members of the far left due to speaking out against Islam. These attacks often come from supporters or even directly within the above organisations and are couched in the same language of the identity politics warriors around the world. Racist. Islamophobe. etc. It is highly notable that the principle authors of the attacks against the two feminist, ex-Muslim women I mentioned are white males.

Max Blumenthal came to my attention due to his [rabid verbal assaults on Ayaan Hirsi Ali](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=max%20blumenthal%20ayaan%20hirsi%20ali). He is the son of Hilary Clintons advisor Sidney Blumenthal, and is known for his anti-Israel/anti-Zionist) writing. 

Max spoke at an anti-Israel event at Westminster sponsored by Corbyn, also present at that event was a chap called James Thring, who is a vocal supporter of David Irving and Lady Michèle Renouf, the intellectual arm of Holocaust Denial.

http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/189172/max-blumenthal-and-anti-zionists

So not only is Corbyn linked to anti-apostate organisations, he is actively supporting anti-Israel advocates, included those in the Holocaust denial factions, and he works for Iran's media unit Press TV.

So, outside of Corbyns social/economic policies (which as a socialist I dont have an issue with) his involvement in other causes is much more of an issue, and its those causes and their supporters I am very much opposed to. The far left is caught up in an extreme version of postmodernist identity politics and if you are in category they oppose they won't hold back in attacking you.",null,1,null,1436131998,null,0,false,0,cst63ff,null,t3_3c716g,null,t1_cst63ff,null,t1_cst02oc,null,null,null,1437612723,null,4,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,4,null

Some higher ups wanted to change the name of one of the wards from A2 to A8, because historically A2 was a certain type of ward and now it wasn't, so for some reason it seemed like a great idea to give it a new name with its new purpose. The wards are all in order on the different floors, it goes top to bottom, so you have A1 and A2 on Level 1, then A3 and A4 on the floor below etc. So with the name change, you'd have A1, A8, A3, A4 etc, which is just confusing as fuck for everyone. It's always been known as A2, why randomly change it to A8 for the sake of it? 

Not only this, but to change all the signs and everything else, it would have cost £15,000. *£15,000* to unnecessarily change one letter in a wards name. And the icing on the cake is they've just forked out £50,000 to have brand new signs put up everywhere in the hospital (mum says that was kinda needed), so they'd be bollocking it all up and adding further expenses onto an already expensive upgrade. All the ward managers (or someone, I can't remember what their roles were but they worked on the wards) in the hospital actually protested and said how fucking stupid it was, and they eventually agreed not to do it. But it just goes to show how these few odd people swanning about at the top can just chime in with a load of expensive bollocks for the hell of it. £15k is pence in the NHS bucket, but it makes you wonder what other shite they're blowing precious resources on, it all adds up.

You didn't ask for a complete history of Anglo-Irish relations - you asked how much anti-Irish sentiment there is in the UK. Aside from the off-hand comment made by my grandpa ages ago, I can honestly say that it's never been an issue I've witnessed either first or second hand. It's never been an issue when I've been with my Irish friends, and it's not something I've encountered in non-Irish company.

Given that you don't actually live here, perhaps you shouldn't make assumptions about what the situation is actually like.

&gt; Maybe you could go outside more instead of spending all your time online? Look in your cities for fuck's sake, and see how badly Irish people are treated. Half of your fucking homeless people are Irish or have Irish heritage! And you have the gall to say there's no Anti-Irish sentiment?

Well that's a little creepy. I didn't realise that you were monitoring how much time I spend online.

My family have dedicated time and energy to helping homeless people and the underprivileged in '[our] cities' so I find it extremely fucking disrespectful for you to ride in here on a moral high-horse and make false accusations about me personally.

I never said that there is no anti-Irish sentiment anywhere in the UK. Perhaps if you had the capacity to comprehend what people are saying here then you've have recognised that fact.

&gt; I'm from the united states btw, where we treat Irish people with respect and allow them to be proud of their heritage whereas to do something like that in the UK would mean government-endorsed bombings.

Because, as we all know, no British person ever allows an Irish person to be proud of their heritage. If we did, we have to bomb them amirite?

Notts is full of great pubs and bars, a quick google will throw up a lot of good suggestions, or just take a wander around. I'm partial to the Organ Grinder, Lincolnshire Poacher (vast selection of whisky), Canal House (nice beer selection, old boathouse, still has longboat inside bar). Also near little mini-pubs like Doctors Orders and erm... that place up Hurt's Yard that I can't remember the name of.

Some great restaurants for eating too if you can afford to treat yourself. Google's your friend there as it's down to taste. If Canada is much like my experience in America though, then you won't have much in the way of proper Indian cuisine available. Get some down ya.

Lots of sports going on, two great historic football teams (though there's none happening as it's summer), an ice hockey team, Trent Bridge for cricket, national watersports centre.

Nottingham Castle is more of a manor than a castle after the original castle got torn to bits in the civil war, but worth a poke around for a tourist. Wollaton Hall has lovely grounds surrounding it and again is a good place to visit for someone who's not from here. Those of us who've spent nearly 30 years here are pretty bloody fed up of spending summer Saturday afternoons staring at that taxidermied bear though. It's also Wayne Manor in the Batman films. Beware of the deer.

Sherwood Forest is better described as Sherwood Patch of Trees nowadays but there are outdoor activities held there.

Galleries of Justice.

Nottingham Contemporary for art.

Have a wander around the Lace Market and Hockley for a small but growing creative quarter.

If you have or can get use of a car, Peak District is a short drive away and is very good if you're into hiking and very Englishy countryside.

And generally being in the Midlands places you slap bang in the middle of the country. You're no more than two or three hours drive / train journey from most of England (excluding rush hour / bank holiday traffic). If you want to get somewhere you can do it without having to set aside a four day weekend to do it. Though if you want to see London properly, you'll need more than a weekend to see what's there. It's much bigger than any city in Canada (going off the top of my head).

Enjoy your stay, hope Notts treats ya well.

Edit - obligatory /r/nottingham plug. It's a bit quiet but something interesting might pop up.

So they tried to push them in to a corner where they would lose domestic support, get forced out, and get replaced.

So Syrzia called their bluff, put the vote to the people, and now it's clear they won't be turfed out any time soon. They managed this even while pensioners are crying outside of banks. It's an amazing win for Tspiras - in the face of EU politicians openly interfering with the internal politics of a sovereign nation.

I think that's a mindset more than just stupid and irresponsible. I just don't think that at the age of 16, most people have it in them to support atrocities like this. Maybe if you are brainwashed from a very young age, but in a lot of cases of people going over it seems to be recent changes. 

This isn't to say we should just abandon them, and even from  a practical point of view, they are also a recruiting tool for ISIS in terms of getting male fighters, but I do think they should be facing some sort of criminal charges when they get back.

In comparison to Gloucester Road or
 st nick's market where some of the shops have so much going on you can spend all day mooching in and out, North street is a bit more convenience based. I often hear people saying they have no need to come to north street because everything they can find here can be found elsewhere so I assume most of the visitors are locals going there for a purpose- to pick up some lunch or something..

What are you cleansing with? I am more wondering if it is not the moisturisers making your skin greasy but rather dehydration or irritation. With a gentler cleanser you might find the Superdrug serum is enough after all.

Eucerin face cream (5% urea) or CeraVe PM lotion (4% niacinamide, ceramides) come to mind. Neither are super cheap but plenty of active ingredients proven useful in dehydrated skin, lightweight lotion-y texture yet a little goes a long way, the CeraVe is a 90ml pack size too.

Another way to stretch the budget is to combine two steps into one, so moisturiser with sunscreen or moisturiser with make up (BB cream or tinted moisturiser).

Those people would be able to use technology to encrypt their communications and so protect themselves. The government is now seeking to undermine that.

Also it's much more difficult to do such things when there is a system in place that requires a judge to review evidence, conclude that surveillance is justified, and issue a warrant. For years we have had mass spying without review by an independent body and without even the knowledge of the public.

&gt;The government using the powers they have to spy on people they suspect of terrorism, is a logical response.

Not when it hasn't prevented a single attack or saved a single life in the more than a decade it has been used. This kind of warrantless mass spying is absolutely useless for such purposes.

The Quran does call for death for apostates, so for a 15 year old Muslim to be convinced by a groomer that what ISIS does is legitimate doesn't seem such a stretch to me.

You're absolutely right that it feeds their egos and influences others to join them. Terrorism is theatre, and theatre needs an audience. If the media stopped covering it, terrorists would not succeed. Thatcher suggested this approach 30 years ago, http://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/16/world/thatcher-urges-the-press-to-help-starve-terrorists.html 

Stopping coverage isn't so simple however. The media could stop reporting on it, but today there's nothing to prevent a smaller blog from spreading the news and going viral. Here's an interesting way to look at this as game theory: http://mironline.ca/?p=3127

Stopping coverage would amount to censorship, and this makes it difficult for people to be well informed. If we stopped hearing about it, would that mean that the problem is over or that we're just not being told any more? Toning it down is a good idea, but it won't happen. Terrorism brings in the viewers, and when there's a new detail, people like to hear about it. If you're not telling them, your competitor will. The game theory applies here too.

The public's demand to know about terrorism, especially when there is a link that is close to home, is great enough that somebody is going to supply that information.

&gt; the political or economic principles of Leon Trotsky, especially the theory that socialism should be established throughout the world by continuing revolution.

Anarchism:

&gt; belief in the abolition of all government and the organisation of society on a voluntary, cooperative basis without recourse to force or compulsion.

Syndicalism:

&gt; a movement for transferring the ownership and control of the means of production and distribution to workers' unions. Influenced by Proudhon and by the French social philosopher Georges Sorel (1847–1922), syndicalism developed in French trade unions during the late 19th century and was at its most vigorous between 1900 and 1914, particularly in France, Italy, Spain, and the US.

Marxism:

&gt; the system of economic and political thought developed by Karl Marx, along with Friedrich Engels, especially the doctrine that the state throughout history has been a device for the exploitation of the masses by a dominant class, that class struggle has been the main agency of historical change, and that the capitalist system, containing from the first the seeds of its own decay, will inevitably, after the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, be superseded by a socialist order and a classless society.

Whats the flaws in that though? Election votes are a pretty clear gauge along with what national identity people base themselves on and the location of the atheists is very important. All my figures are based on ethier the census or election resluts. I would guess a census of 1.8 million people is more accurate than that 1000 or 1500. 


&gt;Catholics, atheists, people of other religions and younger age groups are all more likely to be in favour of reunification than unionism, and the power of every single one of those groups to sway a referendum on the matter is only going to increase as time goes on.

Despite the fact the younger ages define themselves as british more than irish. Actually in the youngest age more people define themselves as british at a higher rate than the age above it. Only 9.4% of atheist call themselves irish. I cant see that as a majority in favour of unification.

It is prohibited from producing its own television so must provide work for the independent sector.

CH4's public-facing function is to provide voices for the minority interests in the country. This means that most of its programming isn't exactly commercially viable. It makes a profit on a select few shows and passes that on to subsidise less commercial content. It doesn't cost the taxpayer any money, as it is forced to work on a commercial basis with the safety net of its own cash reserves for lean years. All profits are reinvested in the channel's operations.

If Channel 4 had to satisfy shareholders, it would have to rebuild itself as a more profitable commercial entity with less distinctive programming, and would then commission fewer shows from a smaller base of SMEs, many of which depend on the channel for their continued existence.",null,0,null,1436136733,null,0,false,0,cst8hpa,null,t3_3c4kcx,null,t1_cst8hpa,null,t1_csse9fs,null,null,null,1437614633,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Well tough shit on them, austerity is not popular in Greece.

Birmingham is a bigger city than Nottingham and you can find loads of great things to do. It's about an hour and 20 mins away on the train from Nottingham. I between the two you have the Derbyshire Peak District which is beautiful. Matlock is pretty easy to get to and offers beautiful views. Tamworth near Birmingham has a castle. Further north of Nottingham you have Sherwood Forest which is lovely. West Yorkshire countryside is stunning. I recommend Harrogate, likely, Saltaire. They're my favourite places in Yorkshire outside of cities like Leeds and York.  

All of these places shouldn't take you long to get to. York is the furthest and will take about 3 hours. 

As far as Nottingham goes itself I love the city and regularly go back to see friends. Given your age I would say the kind of places you want would be the orange tree, spanky van dykes, pit and pendulum, tilt (if you fancy cocktails), das kino is a pretty nice bar too.

I show up and the guy was hungover and kept constantly swearing, like every sentence contained the word fuck and when he explained the theory he kept being like ""Well I could explain it in detail but I don't really give a fuck,"" when we practiced the slow control and I did doing fairly well but the practice area was incredibly small, my 600 square foot flat is bigger so it gave very little opportunity to actually practice, most people had been on a bike before so the instructors kept rushing people along. It gets to lunch and the instructors seperate the groups into 2 and basically says ""sorry guys, you aren't good enough, come back another time"" without explaining anything, they did say we could practice while the others were out in the road and we had the admin person who took bookings to basically watch over us. I was depressed and really gutted, I didn't quite grasp the turning while changing gears while breaking due to the small practice area so I ended up riding the bike into a metal fence...at this point I was like ""fuck it, biking just isn't for me"" and I would have quit if I hadn't just purchased £500 of motorbike gear due to not many places offering equipment while doing the CBT.

Due to embarrassment and not taking a liking to the instructors I changed CBT place and paid another £120, due to the previous issue with changing gears I did the CBT on a moped, went fairly well and I passed second time round.

If they had agreed to the EUs terms, they would probably have loads of defections from the far left of the party, would have to call a new election, and would have been obliterated in the polls (just like PASOK were, going from a 160 seat majority in 2009 to 13 seats in 2015). 

If they'd said no to the terms without a referendum, then the party would have been slated for being non-representative, and the EU would probably keep trying to stonewall them.

However, with the referendum, they've not only shown that Syriza are against austerity, but a significant majority of the Greek people are. It severely weakens the EUs position in negotiations, and may push them towards actually offering debt relief. 

And, like you said, outside realpolitik, not only has Syriza won, but democracy has won. Hopefully we'll see the EU have a real think about the merits of austerity economics, and maybe that'll effect how people in the UK think about it as well (especially seeing that 'you don't want to do a Greece' is often used as the spearhead for austerity in the UK, despite Greece running a surplus).

If they vocally oppose the Troika's treatment of Greece, they are, in essence, tacitly supporting Greece's anti-austerity fight, or at least not emphasising austerity as an imperative. If austerity is so important, why would our politicians disagree with an EU which is willing to do anything to impose it?

However, I can see Greece becoming a focal point of anti-EU arguments as it 'shows why the EU doesn't work', which I've seen vaguely put forward before.

Bamford and Solanke will get there but we are too big of a club to throw them in just yet. So we need to sign a decent/proven striker.

Can we really consider what was politically relevant *fifty years ago* representative of today? It must say something about the left wing in Britain that that's how far back we have to go.

&gt; If you want to abandon working class support, [...] and the support of the North, Liz Kendall is ideal.

Why is that? She's still a left-wing candidate. As long as she is able to show what she can prioritize. She's what Labour needs to appear to be - economically credible (even though the whole ""overspending"" thing is a myth; we lost that argument) and socially conscientious. [This article](http://labourlist.org/2015/06/kendall-pledges-to-combat-tory-welfare-privatisation-with-devolution/) was linked a few days ago:

&gt;Kendall will make the argument for a more competitive banking sector; to ensure that small businesses are able to invest in training and technology; for greater opportunity for employees to own shares in the companies they work for; and for greater trade union membership in the private sector, saying that this “can help raise productivity” by building “more constructive dialogue in companies between management and staff”.

This is the ideal way to promote left-wing policy: by talking about how it will boost productivity. Facilitating owning shares in the company you own is a cornerstone apirational policy; one that benefits working people. The trade union thing is a way of looking to reduce strikes without bizarre laws like a minimum turnout on the ballot, which is popular, but by boosting trade union power rather than reducing it.

&gt;After another 5 years of Tory austerity, NHS mismanagement and increasing wage inequality, people may actually start supporting the socialist ideals that were prevalent in post war Britain.

Didn't we say that five years ago? Is this the answer? To wait another five years, with another Ed Miliband? Is this the best the Labour left can do? Wait for the Tories to become an *even worse* option to most people?

&gt;strong backing of the left-wing media

The what media?

&gt;we may starting winning back votes from the SNP, Lib Dems and Greens.

Honestly, I think it's more likely that those votes would move back to Labour under Tory rule, than Tory votes. It won't win a majority without the Tory votes too, and moving to the left won't get them back.

It only works if the defender coaches a defensive setup that matches our attacking play.

That's a valid style of defending, and it's the one where Carra flourished for Rafa &amp; Houllier. But defending that way compromises your expansive attacking play - which is why Rafa &amp; Houllier built good counter-attacking teams, but also suffered from drawing games they ""should've"" won. 

It doesn't work for Rodgers' style, where the fullbacks need to push on otherwise you have no width, so the CB's need to split to cover the space left by the fullbacks, so every defender has to cover more space.

- Skrtel's positioning isn't great for Rodgers' defensive setup - his natural tendency is to drop deep.

Hopefully we can break a few of our own records this coming season, but the title and champions league are worth more then records imo. We need to once again prove we are the best of the top 4/5 clubs and win 90% of the games against other contenders, a home/away against united would be great.

I want to see more of our academy players step up for cup games, and a few of the youngsters who deserve it should get minutes in the prem. Maybe 4-5 academy players for each cup game, 2-3 start, the rest on the bench?

Also i don't see a lot about our U-Age squads, but i feel it's important they continue to dominate, and i would like to see a sticky thread here devoted to them possibly mods? For the players who go out on loan, we need to start specifying required starts in the contract, to much wasted talent.

With all this being said, we also need to continue our global expansion, and let people around the world see the man in the magic hat, our leader legend, JT, and of course the brilliance of Hazard. I think Chelsea can continue to expand globally and being from Canada,want Roman to buy the MLE ( Toronto Fc, Maple Leafs, Raptors, Marleys ) and re-brand as Chelsea TFC, i can have dreams right?

To address your criticism of the Doctor's origin, that was actually written by someone else (the OP), but it's not supposed to be contradictory. It's supposed to be the reason why the Doctor is chased in the first episode. The Doctor sees the TARDIS station at the end of this episodes flashback, and then we see him start to enter the place in the Pilot episode (because back then we don't actually know why he's being chased at that moment, when it's only now revealed it's because he foolishly was merciful to Daleks).

The writer for that part and I may not have conveyed it that well for someone who doesn't know about this reboots' canon so I can understand the confusion.

The theories about how pain work also heavily involve perception so that people who think they are in pain, then feel in pain etc. 

A fantastic medical historian Roy Porter described it as the generation whose never felt worse but never been better. Certainly doesn't mean that any or all these people 'make it up', it's far to complex to even consider it like that, but it's certainly true that in a way people can 'learn' to be ill and then can easily be diagnosed into conditions which are effectively just groups of people with unexplained vague pain, tiredness like CFS etc. Also, for anyone here who is a sufferer of these conditions, I'm certainly not attacking you or saying that these conditions aren't real, but that as they are effectively just a group of subjective symptoms there could be many people in this grouping with an underlying pathology we just haven't identified yet, as well as many people with nothing wrong except an inactive/unhealthy lifestyle etc that then makes them feel shit (quite self perpetuating as you can imagine). 

Anyway, this is certainly not the way to deal with this anyhow, but think it is important to note that we are very much aware that there are people, who do claim disability, who almost certainly don't have anything actually wrong with them and have sort of self generated a state of illness.

Downing and Henderson lacked the confidence to offer the end product you need from wide players in a 4-4-2, we had two strikers that both wanted to lead the line but who required very different types of service, and when Lucas got injured our central midfield became woefully imbalanced. 

There was a lot of bad luck with the woodwork, but there was also a lot of camping in the opposition's half without posing a real threat. The fact that we scored more league goals with Rodgers, despite losing and not replacing most of the previous season's attacking players in Maxi, Kuyt, Bellamy and Carroll, shows that there was some real underperformance under Kenny, not just 'bad luck'.

I'm also not sure that Sterling, Flanagan and Henderson develop under Kenny to the extent that they have under Rodgers.

But for a more in-depth answer - Rodgers has praised the style of play O'Driscoll tries to implement in the past, and it's similar to his own. That's good and important, because an assistant who's on a completely different page to you is worse than not having one at all.

&gt;

&gt;The __Kingdom of Mercia__ ([Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_language): *Miercna rīce*), usually referred to as __Mercia__ /ˈmɜrsiə, ˈmɜrʃə/, was one of the kingdoms of the [Anglo-Saxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons) [Heptarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptarchy). The name is a [Latinisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinisation_(literature\)) of the [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English) ___Mierce___ or ___Myrce___, meaning ""border people"" (see [March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_(territory\))).

&gt;The kingdom was centred on the valley of the [River Trent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Trent) and its tributaries, in the region now known as the [English Midlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midlands,_England).  The kingdom's ""capital"" was the town of [Tamworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamworth,_Staffordshire), which was the seat of the Mercian Kings from at least around AD 584, when [King Creoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creoda_of_Mercia) built a fortress at the town.

&gt;For 300 years (between AD 600 and 900), having annexed or gained submissions from five of the other six kingdoms of the Heptarchy (East Anglia, Essex, Kent, Sussex and Wessex), Mercia dominated England south of the [River Humber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Humber): this period is known as the [Mercian Supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercian_Supremacy). The reign of [King Offa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offa_of_Mercia), who is best remembered for [his Dyke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offa%27s_Dyke) which designated the boundary between Mercia and the Welsh kingdoms, is sometimes known as the ""Golden Age of Mercia"". [Nicholas Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Brooks) noted that ""the Mercians stand out as by far the most successful of the various early Anglo-Saxon peoples until the later ninth century"",  and some historians, such as [Sir Frank Stenton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Frank_Stenton), believe the unification of [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) south of the [Humber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humber) estuary was achieved during the reign of Offa.

I struggled for some minutes, clicking both the previous links, and only realised as I closed the window what case it referred to - the cyclist who was run over by a car driver who was texting at the time.

Strictly speaking, and if I remember the details right, the car driver claimed that he wasn't texting at the time - the last txt message was send a couple of minutes before the collision, and he said he had stopped by the time the cyclist ""just came out in front of me"".

Otherwise City would be doing far better than us right now judging by the amount of money they've spent over the last 5 or so years. We've spent our money very wisely over the last few years especially unlike Liverpool who did terrible business with their money last season. These teams aren't without money. United spent a metric fuck ton of money in the summer. Our champions league win was with a team that wasn't exactly all superstars. We've been a bigger threat in Europe over the last 10 years than Madrid who've spent far more money than we have.

Look at that suicidal dive down the Williams on the restart - he's still hungry and still willing to take risks. That makes for good F1 when he's in a position to race. And let's not forget he's consistently faster than Rosberg, himself no slouch.

Merc came up with the package, and I include the drivers as a component of that. F1 is big business and money talks. Whilst I would.love to see closer racing, more varied podiums and more competitive teams, I also firmly believe that it should be at the bleeding edge of technology in motorsports. 

I think what F1 needs is consistency in regulation. Every time you change the rules, you hand an advantage to the best equipped (I.e. Richest) teams. They can respond fastest and develop the cars best. 

I also think the money should be shared fairly across the board. Not equally, but fairly. The Ferrari advantage is ridiculous, Ferrari need F1 as much as F1 needs ferrari so stop paying them off.

null,false,Chilton_Squid,,I don't have a bike,null,"First up, it needs an MOT; I don't believe it's currently possible to tax a vehicle without an MOT. An MOT lasts for a year, so hopefully the bike already has one. 

Assuming the bike has an MOT, you can now apply for tax. The law recently changed on this, so the current owner needs to cancel the existing tax and you need to take out your own. This part is easy though - all you need is the reference number from the V5C (the green part of the V5 registration document you MUST get from the previous owner), then go to [the online system](https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-tax) and buy a tax. As soon as you've bought it, the vehicle is okay to ride on the road - you no longer get a tax disc in the post. 

The previous owner should then send off their V5 to the DVLA to say that you're the new owner. You keep the small green V5C part to prove that's the case if he either doesn't bother or it gets lost, which happens a lot. So make sure you get that. 

There is one important thing people forget or don't realise though - the V5 only says who's the registered keeper; it actually has no bearing whatsoever on who the owner is. Make sure you get the seller to just make up a receipt on a piece of paper giving the date, bike details, their details, your details, and signed by both of you. Get two copies. 

That way, if you get stopped on the way home, you can prove to the police that you've bought it. Likewise if you go caning through speed cameras before the V5 has been changed, he can prove it wasn't him riding it - it's for both of your benefits, so get it done. 

However first you'll need insurance. You can sort this out in advance, it's just a case of shopping around online for the best deal. Make sure the start date (and time, sometimes don't start until noon) is obviously before you pick up the bike. 

As for the stolen/money part - you need to do an [HPI Check](https://www.hpicheck.com/) online. Make sure it comes back clear before you go anywhere near buying a second-hand vehicle. 

The whole process is infinitely easier if you have a mate with a van who can help you collect the thing, but I know that's not always possible. 

I'll let someone else comment on checking the bike itself over, that's not really my speciality. Mine is more being dull and filling in paperwork.

A Blood test? why?  I told him to refer me to a specialist and within 4 months I got diagnosed with sleep apnea (I stopped breathing on average 45 times an hour).

Same goes for being allergic to gluten.  For years I had complained about this but did nothing.  After finally agreeing with him to send me to a specialist I found I was very allergic to gluten and had been all my life.

THis issues I have with the GP's is that they dont appear to care.  A quick in and out and done.  I Know they do not posses all the knowledge of what is wrong with a person but if they took their time and actually diagnosed the issues, I would feel like they were actually doing their job.
