null,false,strifeblood,null,null,null,"That's not how it usually works under Jose, though. Mourinho is a strong believer of putting the best lineup in almost every situation except for obvious reasons like necessary rotation against weaker opposition or injuries. He's shown in his managerial career that he will always give a player a fair run of games over his competition if he's doing well. Cahill is in poor form (and has been for the past few matches prior to Spurs too, it's not just the subreddit overreacting after one game because he's been making mistakes for a while but we've been winning in spite of it) and Zouma looked solid last game against Newcastle and didn't make any noticeable mistakes, so I see no reason why Mourinho would give the start to Cahill so soon when Zouma had a good game.

If you want some examples, just look at this year. Schurrle doesn't get any important starts over Willian even though he might benefit by regaining his form by playing a lot more. Luis rarely starts because Jose doesn't like messing with the fullbacks. Last year, he never gave David Luiz the starting CB spot in hopes he'd get better. At Real Madrid, he never gave Casillas his position back after Lopez was in great form. Jose will never give a player in poor form the start in hopes they'll improve over a player who's been solid at a position. So that's why I think Zouma starts. 

People are quick to pull the trigger here, like with Schurrle the past few games he's played and Filipe Luis after that bad game against Southampton. However, it's entirely justified in this case. Cahill has not been anywhere near as good this season compared to last year. This might be due to him just being in a stretch of poor form or being more exposed with Ivanovic's pushing ahead and not getting back in time for counters, but it is what it is.

I'm not really sure if he's ""young"" since strikers these days seem to be peaking at 25-27, especially ones built like Borini.. and in 2 months he's going to be 24 which means he pretty much has 6 seasons left at the top of his game.

I don't think he has shown the potential to be a first team player really. Sterling didn't really break through via sub appearances did he? he just suddenly joined the first team when we were in pretty bad times and I don't think anyone would have said Sturridge would be seen as ""world class"" 3 years ago when he was on the bench for Chelsea.

Forwards breaking through via sub appearances just rarely ever happens, if they break through it's because they get a run of games.. which like I said before - Borini has not received as of yet.

I find it interesting how almost everyone cries about player loyalty yet now when Borini is trying to show loyalty to the club and showing up in the few appearances he's having he's getting shit on by ""fans"" of the club.. sure the £14m would have been nice but after our transfer dealings over the past 18 months we would have probably wasted it anyway.

I got that, I understand. That said, football is also a game of few chances and even fewer goals. I, for one, feel like every time Mario is out there he's probing and testing the defenders. Every time he gets the ball, the other team has something to worry about. FFS last game he came on and totally outclassed the entire defense, unlucky not to have assisted or scored a goal. If not for De Gea, who is in the form of his life, he would have probably bagged a brace against the scum. I say we give him a real run out- his resume speaks for itself IMO. Attitude and talent are both there, it's just the end product for him that needs to show up.

Lovren, in contrast, looks totally lost. As Carra and Gary Neville pointed out on MNF, he has spacing issues that date back to his time in Southampton. He's passionate and seems a good lad, but it looks as if his level is what we're seeing now and what he did at Lyon.

The driver is a prick and shouldn't be on the road, but whilst the cyclist's actions **no way justified what happened**, he isn't guilt free. He was a bit gobby (a lot of people are, but when in a car no one can hear you), and cycled up the inside of the van when there was no need to do so. He has probably also been told by the police to simmer down as well.

In short, I doubt the van man would get any more punishment than a driver re-education course (look up cycling incidents, a depressingly high number involving cyclist deaths are ""resolved"" with the driver's being able to carry on driving), but they have had a lot of public shaming already, so there's that.",null,0,null,1421484038,null,0,false,0,cnrsk4m,null,t3_2smgvn,null,t1_cnrsk4m,null,t1_cnr0dwi,null,null,null,1424828587,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

null,false,theYword,null,null,null,"The theory is that if the matches were televised it would affect attendances. Therefore only a select number of games are broadcast. Its the same for the EPL and FA Cup. The reason you don't notice with the EPL so much is that due to the sale of foreign broadcast rights, all matches are now broadcast live somewhere (as there are no restrictions on them being shown abroad). 

However the FA cup has been less commercially successful/savy than the EPL and hasn't sold the rights quite as extensively overseas. Therefore for the Burnley game there was not broadcast by any channel.

Also you cannot underestimate how much English fans value 'the romance' of the FA cup. On the night we played Burnley there was a game between AFC wimbledon and Liverpool. In case you don't know, Wimbledon came up from amateur status in the 70's and 80's and won the cup in '89 by beating Liverpool (who were probably the best team in Europe at the time). Since then Wimbledon was sold out from under their fans and relocated to Milton Keynes which is miles away. So the fans set up their own club from nothing and after about 7 promotions they actually got into the Football league (four levels below the EPL) which is pretty miraculous. So even if they had shown Spurs v Burnley, not even I would have watched it. 

In the fourth round, there is no way that us v Leicester is a big match up. You have to remember that below the top 8 teams in the EPL, the fan base of English clubs is much more evenly spread amongst the lower leagues. For example, teams like Leeds, Nottingham Forest, Birmingham etc all have pretty big followings. So if Leeds got Sheffield United in the cup it might well be the biggest tie of the round given their fan bases and the local derby element.

The BBC have picked Bristol City and Cambridge because they have the biggest potential Romance factor (and I basically agree with them). No matter what happens in Spurs v Leicster, it will likely not be romance.

* Hope that the GP agrees with you -- if not s/he might recommend some other course of treatment.
* If the GP agrees with you, and there is a chiropractor registered with the local NHS, you can be referred for treatment.
* Wait until your treatment date arrives -- depending on supply and demand the wait for non-urgent specialist consultations can be anything from a couple of weeks to several months
* Get your free NHS chiropratice work done

 - firstly there was a lot of pressure to get to your next lesson as fast as possible. There was also pressure to vacate the changing rooms in case another class had to come in and get changed. Having pe/swimming run into break times or the end of school and you have a bunch of kids who do not want to spend their free time in school having a proper wash.

Sometimes you had a teacher after pe who was more lax but it seemed as though most people would rather mill about doing fuck all and waste lesson time if they chose to exploit that.

 - after getting out if the pool you'd run through a small corridor where some shower heads spray cold water at you. Because it was cold water and swimming was mostly for those ~13 and under, nobody was really all that keen on standing under the water for a while and scrubbing off or anything. It wasn ice cold water, just a little chilly.

 - for pe lessons we were never told to bring towels, we were never instructed how to turn the showers on etc. We sometimes used the pe changing rooms for rugby fixtures so as we got older, some would take the time post match to shower. Especially during my time playing for the first XV a lot of people would have showers after training and games, they were a lot more mature at this point  about communal showering.

 - when we were in primary school, after our longer pe sessions, we were all required to wash in the communal showers. As you might imagine, 40 nude &lt;12 year old boys are very concerned with not showing their dicks to everyone, not looking as though they are checking other people out, and anxious to get clothed and away from the ""perv"" teachers. After primary school we weren't required to shower after sports sessions.

Tl;dr: pressure to get changed quickly and get to next lesson/break time, young boys don't generally give a shit about hygiene, young boys don't want to be accused of being gay. 

I can't speak for girls'' experiences of course. I stopped taking compulsory pe/swimming lessons in 2011, although I still took the longer games sessions on Wednesday afternoons.

Seriously, though, I like what I'm starting to see in our side.

Now, I'm not naive, I get it. Rodgers and footballers will always say media-friendly stuff. After all, what are they *really* supposed to say? God knows that ironically while honesty is always craved by supporters, it is rarely welcome when it actually happens. Haha.

But, that being said, take a step back and start thinking about the quotes from Rodgers and the players throughout the season.

* After our early-season stumbles, there was a lot of talk about how much we missed Suarez and Sturridge, how there were all these new transfers figuring out their place in the side, etc.

* Then Rodgers shifts the formation and then we hear more positive quotes praising the new formation and the comfort everyone feels from that change.

* Then you start to see the likes of Lallana, Moreno, Manquillo, Markovic, Can, etc. starting to make more of an impact on games.

* Around the same time Gerrard announces his departure for the MLS and LA Galaxy.

* That seemed to create a sense from the younger players that *their time is NOW* and it is time to not only give a legend like Gerrard the proper send-off, but also start staking their claim for the future as well because of the stark realization that they *are* the future.

* Now we're seeing more quotes about confidence, focus, etc. The *belief* is there.

Due to the modern economic landscape of European football these days, I believe that consistent Champions League qualification is crucial to our future success and that is what we must strive for this season and we're currently only 5 points off of 4th place.

Now, I get it. It's still a tough climb. It won't be easy. I realize we probably have to play near-perfect football to overtake West Ham, Tottenham, Arsenal, Man Utd. The 5 points from 4th place is not daunting, however, what *is* daunting is that we have to leap-frog *four* clubs.

But... positive signs are there:

* The young players and new transfers are starting to emerge.
* Sterling will be back.
* Sturridge will be back.
* Our confidence is growing.

And if the likes of Henderson and Coutinho can chip in a timely goal here and there and if our defence tightens up even just a wee bit more?

We might be able to get there!

Even so, I still find it to be quite frustrating, at the least, that fans of a club can't watch their team play save for going to the match themselves - while rules out just about every foreign fan plus the fans of the away side, save for a small percentage. This seems unfair.

And while I agree that watching Cambridge vs United would probably be more interesting than Spurs vs Leicester, I feel that as a fan, I should have that choice. 

To expand upon that a bit, I live in Taiwan. Over the past three years, we expats here have gotten quite a few advancements that make watching sports abroad quite convenient (and hardly any of it is on the  TV). The following are just an example (prices are in US $ for full pass, i.e. all games shown):

NFL (American football) - nfl.com/gamepass ($179.99)

MLB (American Baseball) - mlb.tv ($119.99)

NHL (American Hockey) - gamecenter.nhl.com ($109.99)

NBA (American Basketball) - nba.com/leaguepass ($129.99)

NCAA (American college sports) - espnplayer.com ($24.99/month) (I only use it from Sep - April)

MLS (American soccer/football) mlssoccer.com/mlslive ($65.99) (Need a VPN or Proxy because MLS doesn't want foreigners to watch their league for some reason)

Champions League/FA Cup/MLS/+some others - foxsoccer2go.com ($24.99/month) (I use for Champions League + Europa, and FA Cup if available)

Premier League - premierleaguepass.com  ($34.99 for the whole season, all clubs, I shit you not)

So there you have it. For American sports leagues (save for the MLS), you can watch just about ***any*** match, legally, while living abroad, if you're willing to pay. This includes just about any event aired on ESPN as that ESPNplayer website has additional subscription options for poker, tennis, bowling, etc.

We didn't have this 2 years ago. This is the first year for both ESPNplayer and PremierLeaguePass (at least in TW; it's been in NZ for a while). The rest have been around longer but have made great strides. 

Anyway, I'm getting a bit off-topic here, but the point is that all of those listed above, save for NFL game pass, are also available in the US, sometimes under different names. So it baffles me that English football, which is arguable the best in the world in terms of competition, draw, and parity, is still miles behind. 

I just saw an article today that says the PL will open up rights for next year for websites to host every match on their servers, which is a huge step forward. But in 2015, it should already exist.

Sure. I get it. I understand that.

I think I just wanted to make a point about the idea of *expectation.*

Ya, you know what? Our worst fears came true. We did kinda pull a Spurs. All the new transfers came in and it didn't all come together all at once. Then Sturridge got injured and it made everything worse.

That's what happened then. But hopefully we can take some solace in what is happening *now* and adjust our attitudes and expectations of young and/or foreign players joining a big club like Liverpool FC.

Therefore, as much criticism as new transfers get for not showing their worth quickly enough, I think we should express the same amount of praise when footballers start to grow and adjust and succeed instead of just saying, 'Well, this is what we *expected* from the beginning, Markovic.' I think that's a bit unfair.

Listen, I'm not happy with the way this season has gone. And even though I certainly knew the new transfers (young or not; English or not) would struggle getting to know each other as a *team* but I didn't think we'd struggle this much.

However... I'm glad that we're seeing improvements, growth, evolution, confidence sooner rather than later.

null,false,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"&gt;The article mentions 200 accidents in that period of time. A year. I'd expect a higher figure than that without weed being involved.

It actually says 200 deaths per year may be caused by drug users driving, with around 1700 deaths per year on the roads in total, that is significant. 

&gt;Look at the number of weed-smokers in the UK, then consider how many may be driving every day and night over the course of a year.

Not sure what your point is. The whole point of this article is that generally the police do not test for drugs. 

&gt; In 2009-10 police carried out 223,423 breathalyser tests for alcohol but just 489 field impairment tests. 

So its impossible to get a clear image of how many accidents are caused by drug users from official statistics.

In terms of how you might go about forcing change. To prove that it is a significant problem, you need to get a group of parents together. As I said, one or two parents are unlikely to be able to demonstrate that there is a significant problem.

Once you've got the group, you can start by speaking to your local MP...getting him on board is important. Once he is aware of the problem, ask him to write to the Department for Education.

Alternatives; You could also write to Ofsted, they have a lot of powers in that area as well.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Billie-Jo_Jenkins#Legal_proceedings_against_Sion_Jenkins

&gt; The basis for the referral outlined in the Commission's Statement of Reasons was that: 'There is evidence, not before the jury, that suggests Mr Jenkins could not have committed the murder' [2] The second appeal in August 2004 was successful: the Court of Appeal quashed his original conviction as unsafe and ordered a retrial, with Jenkins being released on bail.

&gt;At the retrial, some experts stated that the 158 blood spots could have come from Billie-Jo's airways as Jenkins tended to Billie-Jo.[3] The jury was unable to come to a majority verdict after 39 hours of deliberating. A second retrial was likewise unable to reach a majority verdict, and at the Old Bailey in London, on 9 February 2006 Siôn Jenkins was officially declared not guilty. The Crown Prosecution Service indicated that no further retrials of Jenkins would be sought, and he was formally acquitted.[4]",null,0,null,1421490427,null,0,false,0,cnrtrx7,null,t3_2spq2u,null,t1_cnrtrx7,null,t1_cnrt402,null,null,null,1424827964,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null
null,false,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,null,"&gt;It actually says 200 deaths per year may be caused by drug users driving, with around 1700 deaths per year on the roads in total, that is significant.

That's even worse - 200 deaths *may* be caused by drug users driving.

&gt;Not sure what your point is.

My point is that the number of stoned drivers out there *right now* should be causing a lot more deaths if it affects ones' driving to the extent of, say, alcohol.

&gt;The whole point of this article is that generally the police do not test for drugs.

They do, but via a capability test - walk the line, etc....that seems to be a much better way of doing it.

&gt;So its impossible to get a clear image of how many accidents are caused by drug users from official statistics.

Unless you consider how many weed-smokers drive, and why there aren't a lot, lot more deaths on the road already if the risk is so much greater.

TBF, I'm really only talking about weed, rather than all drugs - but actually, adding all drugs into the equation and I'm actually dumbfounded as to why the numbers aren't higher, considering the amount of drug-driving that's gone on since 1988 and the birth of the whole rave scene.

If that's the case then there's no real need to have the water heater on at all. All it does it keep a small amount of water warm so when it comes out of the tap you don't have to wait for it to heat up. If it only takes a few seconds for the water to come through hot anyway, then there's little point in using the water heater.

You're quite correct that the water heater won't affect the shower, in fact I'd be surprised if the shower unit had a hot water input at all. It's more likely that it has a cold water supply that's heated quickly in a small tank by the shower unit. (This does appear to be the case- the tank is [*item 11 on page 5 of the manual*](http://www.tritonshowers.co.uk/media/924270/jade_ii_satin.pdf) and on page 8 the water requirements mention it should be connected directly to the mains.)

Most efficient use of central heating would depend on when you are actually in the property- little point heating a property if there's nobody at home. I used to set mine to switch on about an hour before I would get up and switch off just before I usually left the house for work, then switch back on for a few hours in the evening until when I usually went to bed. That way it wasn't on for more than about five hours a day but would keep the house reasonably warm when I was likely to be around. You should be able to set different schedules for each day of the week as well as switch it on/off manually if you want.

Yes. Absolutely yes.

I could write pages on the arguments and counter arguments I've had with people about this.

The most common one is ""Why should I be forced to vote?""

My answer is: In Australia's democracy, you are only required to do two things: vote and jury duty. That's it. Voting is only every few years, and jury duty might never happen. It's hardly that onerous and, if you ever complain about any politician, then you have the opportunity to cast your vote and help to make a difference.

The alternative to compulsory voting is far worse:  organised voting. You get entire religious groups urging their congregation to vote for their preferred candidate, and various other self interest groups who will vote for their own interests. If their interests don't align with yours, then your life could get a little more miserable.

There's no excuse for violence on either side. If a situation is dangerous enough to damage you, the responsible parties are going to be pretty sheepish or can be made to feel ashamed if you get the chance. If it's all slow stuff like filtering the worst that can happen is generally cosmetic and only if one party really isn't paying attention or cocks up.

Blaming Muslims for grooming gangs = Was an instance yes, but not a primary muslim problem, so a blanket prejudice statement.  Recent Paedophile ring in the heart of government is far more of a concern.

So mass immigration is a Muslim problem now? Thought that other european countries where at fault. Prejudice for political spin, woo great!

Allowed big ghettos to develop, not an isolated Muslim problem, its more of a wealth problem.

Shira courts, sorry what. Clearly bullshit, because Shira courts only deal with domestic Muslim grievances among the Muslim community, thought UKIPers would love this, would help reduce costs from civil courts. To re-iterate, Shira courts do not deal with criminal justice and never will.

Allowing Muslims to 'create' they own independent state within Britain... sounds like bullshit to me.

Genital mutilations among women, not isolated to Muslim communities.

Farage agrees with Sean sentiments entirely, if you know anything about Sean Hannity, you'll know to that is totally toxic as this guy has proven him self to be a total liar and bigot.

Yes, with only 1700 road deaths in total each year 200 is a significant proportion. Or do you think 200 isn't worth worrying about? 

&gt;My point is that the number of stoned drivers out there right now should be causing a lot more deaths if it affects ones' driving to the extent of, say, alcohol.

I've been over this several times in the posts above. There are a lot more people drink driving on the roads right now than there are deaths by drink driving. That does not mean those people who don't get in an accident are ""ok to drive"" while drunk. It means they were lucky. 

In the same way, there are a lot of people who drive high who don’t get into any accidents, but that is not because driving high is safe for most people, it is simply luck. Almost everyone who ever drove while drunk or high and got in an accident thought they were ok to drive, your ability to drive while high or drunk is absolutely no different to anyone else’s. 

&gt;They do, but via a capability test - walk the line, etc....that seems to be a much better way of doing it.

Testing for for the residue  of a drug in someone’s system is a much more accurate way of determining whether or not they have ingested drugs. 

&gt;TBF, I'm really only talking about weed, rather than all drugs - but actually, adding all drugs into the equation and I'm actually dumbfounded as to why the numbers aren't higher, considering the amount of drug-driving that's gone on since 1988 and the birth of the whole rave scene.

As I have already said, You wont get into an accident every time you drive high or drunk, that’s not what anyone is saying. But the reason we have deaths and accidents on the road each year due to drink and drugs is that people THINK they can drive intoxicated on the roads. They think they are better drivers than all those people who get in accidents, because they have never been in a accident before. Well most people who are in a serious accidence are only in one their whole lives. It has noting to do with the skill of the driver, it is all down to luck.

* Polling happens in May during exam time. Yes it only takes 15-20 minutes to walk to the local polling station and vote but that's a chunk of time out of crucial revision for tomorrow's exam.

* FPTP + living in a safe seat = your opinion is completely disregarded because it's not shared with the majority of other people who just happen to live in your local area. There's also the suspicion that boundaries are gerrymandered.

* None of the parties actually offer what you want. The one or two that do offer a significant chunk of favourable policies have next to no chance of winning because of FPTP.

Moving to PR would address half the problems. Young people will be encouraged to actually get out and vote, and smaller parties would be encouraged to canvass in what are otherwise safe seats to get the attention of the minority's opinions.

It is - but consider the number of deaths on the road and how that figure has gone down over the years, due to legislation and road-side checks - why hasn't the number of drug-related incidents gone up, considering it's rarely truly checked for?

&gt;Or do you think 200 isn't worth worrying about?

More people die from alcohol. Why aren't you banning drinking? That's where oh-the-humanity gets us.

&gt;That does not mean those people who don't get in an accident are ""ok to drive"" while drunk. It means they were lucky.

This would be true if the drug-driving wasn't already happening in such huge numbers - that changes the burden of proof, because if the effects were that significant, a lot more people would have had accidents by now (note how alcohol is almost opposite to this).

&gt;You wont get into an accident every time you drive high or drunk, that’s not what anyone is saying.

And that's not what I was saying, either. I was asking why *so many* unchecked drivers *don't* get into trouble when, going by alcohol, the figures should be a lot more apparent - and your repeat-reply isn't enough; you can't really dismiss the point by saying the other 98.8% of stoned drivers 'were lucky'.

The issues are significant and at the moment have the support and are being addressed by the governing body as they unfold - so its more than just a gripe about a minor issue like uniform policy.

There are several issues however I'm going to be quite vague about them as they are ongoing.  The overall gripe is that since the school has been taken over at the start of May last year, the school has suffered from a lack of direction and leadership resulting in an overall drop in standards and transparency (at governor level).  The academy reshuffled the governors so that half the existing governors were sacked and standards committees etc no longer had any 3rd party members (ie - only school / academy staff)  Meetings are now only scheduled once a term for a couple of hours rather than every half term for as long as necessary with additional meetings to cover additional ground if required.  

So at the last governor meeting figures presented to the governors as part of the terms data-drop to assess standards and progress were done so as an overview which it has now come to light a few months later as being fairly inaccurate and misleading. There are also other serious issues that (hygiene, safeguarding, special needs) ave been brought to light that the school / academy have been neglecting to address or quite frankly hiding.  Members of staff are resigning and parents are thinking seriously of removing their kids from the school.

My personal gripe is that if the academy can fuck up quite so badly in 6 months, I don't think they are fit to run the school.

From my POV the game is all about knowing the strengths and weaknesses of all teams including your rivals, and being able to select  the right players based on this rather than how you feel about them. And my support of fantasy football comes second, behind the actual premier league, by the way. So for example I *might* set up a fantasy team where some of my players actually profit from a spurs loss, if this is what I think is likely to happen on a purely statistical basis, but come the actual match I'm right there with everyone else cheering on Spurs with all my heart to fight the odds and win the game. Fuck fantasy football, I want Spurs to win.

Same goes for Sanchez. I'm certainly not rooting for Sanchez to score, for example, but I'm recognising that in all likelihood he probably will get points- and then using that against him! Sanchez, the arsenal player, is contributing towards the success of a spurs fan in FF. Take that Arse!

1. Form a parent's group
2. Arrange meeting between MP and parent's group
3. Get MP to write to DoE
4. Parent's group write to Ofstead
5. Contact local media perhaps?
6. Take some legal advice to see if there are any legal avenues

An age-restricted bond is a neat way of artificially raising rates for the target demographic without having much impact on the wider economy (working age people would mostly be worse off after a rate rise). It's also easier to stop than other subsidies to the elderly like winter fuel payments, bus passes, cancer drugs fund etc - just don't issue more bonds. Assuming £10bn of 3 year bonds are sold at 4% and yields on equivalent gilts are about 1%, that's a total subsidy of about £300m a year, which isn't that huge as far as these things go - the winter fuel payment costs about £2bn a year.

It's worth noting that money can be withdrawn early subject to a 90 day interest penalty, hence the effective yield on the 3 year bond with withdrawal after 1 year is higher than that on the 1 year bond (3.01% after 1 year, 3.5% after 2), so they're pretty flexible and generally much better than any savings account.

How can you say it has not, ""considering it's rarely truly checked for"". That’s the point of introducing this legislation. The article states that 200 is the estimated number of deaths caused by drugs, but we don't test for drugs, so we actually don't know. Introducing this legislation would give us some actual facts about how many deaths and accidents are caused by drug use, and that can only be a good thing. At the moment we are just guessing. 

&gt;More people die from alcohol. Why aren't you banning drinking? That's where oh-the-humanity gets us.

Who's talking about banning anything? As I said in my first comment. You can be for the legalisation or decriminalisation of drugs and still think its a bad idea for people to drive while high on them. 

&gt;This would be true if the drug-driving wasn't already happening in such huge numbers

But as I said, we don't test for drugs at the roadside at the moment, so we don't have any figures. You can't say2its safer to smoke and drive than drink and drive"" because you do not have any figures to back that up.  

&gt;I was asking why so many unchecked drivers don't get into trouble when, going by alcohol, the figures should be a lot more apparent

Again unless im missing something I’ve already answered this. MOST people who drink and drive wont get into an accident. Only a small number will, but that’s not because they are bad drivers, its because of luck. Of those, the number of people killed by drink drivers is quite small. That does not mean that we make drink driving legal, because most people won't cause an accident. It might only make driving 10% more dangerous, but if that leads to a few hundred deaths on the road each year, it should be banned.

&gt;you can't really dismiss the point by saying the other 98.8% of stoned drivers 'were lucky'.

But the figure is the same for drunk drivers. Most intoxicated journeys will end in nothing bad happening, say 99%. But that means that 1 in every 100 journeys with the driver drunk or high WILL end in an accident. of those, maybe only 1% will end in a death, but that is all just down to luck, not the skill of the driver.

I know the police armed with handguns in Paris didn't fare so well but at least they put up a fight and maybe helped the attackers decide to retreat. The whole point of terrorism is to make your target afraid - I wouldn't ever want the regular police to be armed in this country but I definitely think we should have more of an armed police force. We saw what happened in Northumbria's area when Moat went on the run, they weren't capable of finding and capturing a single, untrained person armed with a shotgun. It was a major national operation to secure Rothbury and the surrounding area with armed officers from loads of other forces being drafted in. The same thing happened in France last week, I read that at least 40,000 armed officers from the various police forces and specialist units were mobilised. There are only around 7000 armed officers in Britain. I don't think we could cope with a properly organised and coordinated terrorist attack (or attacks).

null,false,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,null,"&gt; How can you say it has not, ""considering it's rarely truly checked for"".

Because it would be more prevalent in accidents attended by medical staff or police where people *do* get tested if it's apparent - sure, if someone smokes weed and drives with no issues, they 'may get away with it' - but if the effects were actually that bad, there would already be a lot more accidents involving stoned drivers. Hence my point about alcohol not following this pattern (and hence it's silly to class them as the same in terms of impairment).

&gt;Who's talking about banning anything?

You are - because if 200 deaths a year from drugs (*all* drugs) means we're prepared to criminalise a great many people, it's not a great leap to ban drinking completely (and not just for driving) because of the obvious effects and trouble it causes. Hence oh-the-humanity - there has to be balance, or we ban everything because one person didn't read the label.

&gt;You can be for the legalisation or decriminalisation of drugs and still think its a bad idea for people to drive while high on them.

Correct - so if you think it's bad, compare it to the currently-legal drugs we can take and how we drive on them, provide statistics, a breakdown, and why something that has a lot, lot less effect on the figures is worthy of a more extreme reaction (which is what this legislation is without figures that show more problems than, say, alcohol).

&gt;But as I said, we don't test for drugs at the roadside at the moment, so we don't have any figures.

You're asserting that nobody's doing it because you can't prove as such? That they're all using the lack of testing to get away with it and therefore *should* be contributing to much higher road-death figures?

&gt;You can't say2its safer to smoke and drive than drink and drive"" because you do not have any figures to back that up.

200 *drug* related deaths. Now look at the weed-alone deaths, if possible - even if it were all 200, that's still lower than alcohol and *a lot* lower than alcohol-related incidents were back when drinking and driving wasn't as legislated against.

&gt;Again unless im missing something I’ve already answered this.

You are :-)

&gt; MOST people who drink and drive wont get into an accident.

But it's not happening in anywhere near the same numbers. Most (if not all) weed-smokers would acknowledge that drinking is a different kettle of driving.

&gt;It might only make driving 10% more dangerous, but if that leads to a few hundred deaths on the road each year, it should be banned.

Hence we're now into the fallacy of blaming 200 drug-deaths on weed. Cocaine? sure, aggression-tastic. Speed? Same thing, and so on. So why aren't we separating everything, preferring to base legislation on 'drugs'? It's not 1982.

&gt;But the figure is the same for drunk drivers.

It is? In which case, why are the drug-related accidents not higher, considering being stoned (for example) won't usually be an issue *even if you are* stopped by the police, which isn't something you can say about alcohol. If police ceased stopping drivers for drinking, accidents would go up. Why has the same not happened with weed, considering they've never *begun* stopping people for it?

There's a reason why he's played every single PL minute this season and we've only seen the Luis/Dave pairing once in a CL match I believe. Jose seems to love his physical presence a bit too much in my opinion. 

I really wanted a Luis/Dave pairing as our main fullback pairing too, but it doesn't look like it'll happen unlike Iva gets injured because he should have been benched at least one or two games to try the Luis/Dave combo. I just think it's a much better pairing. It's still that typical Mourinho balance of a defensive minded fullback and an offensive minded one, but Luis is better than Iva going forward, knowing when to go forward and tracking back due to his pace. Dave also gets to play his natural RB position. Only real issue is that a Willian and Dave pair on the right side is a bit too defensive minded and forces the attack to the center or left because Willian isn't great going forward.

I think Luis is our best fullback when it comes to offense, Azpi our second best. I think Azpi has better defensive discipline as well, compared to Iva.

I don't think we've seen enough of Dave/Willian on the same side to fairly judge them though. Who knows, with a more defensively disciplined fullback behind him, Willian might excel and focus more on his offensive game, seeing as he won't need to cover in behind as much?

And when Dave actually does go forward, I think he can offer more than Ivanovic.

If you are only testing people once they reach the hospital then you are missing out on the thousands of accidents that take place when no one ends up in a hospital. Regardless, you are using a different system for measuring drugs and alcohol, roadside vs hospital, so you are obviously going to get vastly different results. 

&gt;if someone smokes weed and drives with no issues, they 'may get away with it' - but if the effects were actually that bad, there would already be a lot more accidents involving stoned drivers.

If someone smokes weed and drives  they almost certainly WILL get away with it, same for drinking, because the vast majority of those journeys will not end in an accident. But a significant proportion WILL, and that why it's illegal.

&gt;You are - because if 200 deaths a year from drugs (all drugs) means we're prepared to criminalise a great many people, it's not a great leap to ban drinking completely (and not just for driving) because of the obvious effects and trouble it causes.

No, I really don't follow your logic there. I haven’t suggested banning anything, and no one else has. 

&gt;Hence oh-the-humanity - there has to be balance, or we ban everything because one person didn't read the label.

We're not talking about someone spilling hot coffee on themselves, we are talking about people driving heavy machinery into innocent bystanders. 

&gt;Correct - so if you think it's bad, compare it to the currently-legal drugs we can take and how we drive on them, provide statistics, a breakdown, and why something that has a lot, lot less effect on the figures is worthy of a more extreme reaction

There are many legal drugs that you are told not to drive on, and would be held responsible for if you did drive on them, Also, you keep asking for evidence, but that’s exactly what this legislation will provide, evidence on how many accidents  are drug related. 

&gt;You're asserting that nobody's doing it because you can't prove as such?

How do you gather evidence without testing for drug use? 

&gt;200 drug related deaths. Now look at the weed-alone deaths, if possible - even if it were all 200, that's still lower than alcohol and a lot lower than alcohol-related incidents were back when drinking and driving wasn't as legislated against.

There around 300 directly drink related deaths each year, and drink driving prevalence is much, much higher than driving after smoking weed, so there is a good chance the figure are similar, but without testing we will not know. 

&gt;But it's not happening in anywhere near the same numbers.

How do you gather numbers without testing for drug use? 

&gt;Hence we're now into the fallacy of blaming 200 drug-deaths on weed. Cocaine? sure, aggression-tastic. Speed? Same thing, and so on. So why aren't we separating everything, preferring to base legislation on 'drugs'? It's not 1982.

Again,im saying that weed related deaths have a similar proportion to drink driving, considering the respective prevalence. 

&gt;?It is? In which case, why are the drug-related accidents not higher, considering being stoned (for example) won't usually be an issue even if you are stopped by the police

How do you gather numbers without testing for drug use?

Blaming the SNP for this just indicates a lack of your understanding of where powers and competencies lie in the UK's constitution.

Incidentally, the SNP negotiated that cuts should fall later in Scotland than in rUK (a more stimulus-based policy), directed as much to capital investment as possible, acted to stave off the worst of the spare room subsidy (bedroom tax) cuts, and pursued and apprencticeship education policy for youth unemployment with the result that, actually, Scotland weathered the recession quite well despite being finance heavy. 

Scotland entered recession later, had a less-deep recession, and passed pre-preak more quickly, has higher economic activity, lower unemployment, lower youth unemployment, and GDP growth not far behind the UK average, despite slower population growth.

You turned me into a downvoter with that remark.

As for Suso: We have better players in his position already. When Sterling first started getting time, Suso got an equal amount. Sterling did really well while Suso looked a step behind. Sterling continued to get games. Suso bitched about not getting games.

IMO Suso is a slower, less flairy, less creative, less technical Coutinho with a bit of an attitude problem. He would have been great to keep for rotation and future potential, but he wanted first team football ahead of better players.

I'm not all that sorry he's gone (even if I wish him all the best and do think he'll be a good player in the future) but I am sorry that he left for so little (although I'd happily take the rumoured 4.5m).

As for the point of the Academy: It has a twofold purpose - Producing first team players and generating transfer revenue. United's academy is a great example. Football Manager reckons there are currently 32 United graduates playing in the top 5 leagues, and yet their first team uses one fringe player and that's about it (the Brazillian twins joined at 18, so they don't count).

I would say he is more consistent than Coutinho while probably slightly less talented. I am well aware that selling Academy players is good business but surely this is one player that could've been given more of an opportunity.

I have complained on this subreddit before about the end and I will do so again. The fucking directors fucked up with the ending and destroyed all the fans. As /u/ASausageInTheMouth said, it's like Merlin's destiny was never fulfilled. We didn't get the grand Golden Age we were promised. The damn writers needed to have paced the last season better. If they had done that, then maybe we wouldn't be a wreck. 

I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/merlinbbc/comments/1tj7yk/spoilers_if_there_had_been_just_one_more_season/) about a year ago with ideas about if there had been one more season, but lets be honest, the writers could have satisfyingly wrapped up Merlin in the last season if a) there weren't so many filler episodes and b) they weren't fucking idiots.

(TV: Daleks in Manhattan) They were cephalopod, being large brained creatures with tentacles, though young mutants were globular, soft and shapeless with tendrils. Although usually dependent on their travel machines for offence/defence, the bare mutant could be dangerous; even the young were quite lethal and capable of strangulation with their tentacles, and, in this way, attacked the Fourth Doctor. (TV: Genesis of the Daleks) The Doctor once said that they had a deadly sting, and during a 1984 incursion into London, one of these creatures, separated from its casing, attacked and injured a human soldier without difficulty. (TV: Resurrection of the Daleks) 

The mutants on occasion demonstrated an accelerated healing ability in response to localised wounds. One Dalek mutant in particular, while being tortured by Commander Farrow, began to repair its damaged body, its flesh growing over Farrow's hand and burning it. (AUDIO: Jubilee) 

The voice of a Dalek was electronic as the actual vocalisations from the mutants amount to little more than squeaking sounds. Without the assistance of their casing, they were unable to produce speech as they do not possess tongues or vocal chords. (TV: Resurrection of the Daleks, AUDIO: Jubilee) 

Kaled mutants were quite possibly fatal to a Time Lord when eaten. (PROSE: The Scarlet Empress) However, their ""Dalek juice"" could be ingested with no apparent ill-effect. (AUDIO: Jubilee) 

 Variations edit

Dalek Mutant 2 
 
Another Kaled mutant. (TV: The Five Doctors)

Dalek human mutant 
 
A Dalek created from a mutated human. (TV: The Parting of the Ways)

Kaled mutants often varied in appearance, as the Daleks continuously altered their DNA, (TV: Victory of the Daleks) though kept the same basic structure of a relatively-octopoid species with a comparatively large brain. 

Davros's original mutants were yellowish-green globs with tendrils able to lash out and choke someone. (TV: Genesis of the Daleks) Thousands of years later, there were mutants in the Skarosian wilds. These appeared as gurgling pink blobs that could stretch and be handled, but had no apparent tentacles, brain, or eyes. Whatever reason they were not in Dalek casings is unknown. (TV: Destiny of the Daleks) 

Other mutant variations included one that possessed a clawed ""hand"", during a time when the Thals believed the Daleks' mutation had not come ""full-circle"" and that they had not reached their final form. (TV: The Daleks) Other mutations were green blobs with tendrils that were ""scooped"" into their casings. (TV: The Power of the Daleks, The Evil of the Daleks) 

During the Imperial-Renegade Dalek Civil War, the mutants were eyeless and green with whip-like tentacles. (TV: The Five Doctors, Resurrection of the Daleks) The Imperial Daleks commanded by Davros were surgically altered, with their appendages physically grafted into their machines, which the Renegade Daleks saw as impure. (TV: Remembrance of the Daleks) 

Others, after the Last Great Time War, were pale blue-green or green-brown with one large functioning eyeball and a small vestigial socket. The remnants of a face could be seen, more clearly on some mutants than on others; as well as the functioning eye and the sealed-up eye, a nose and mouth were vaguely discernible. (TV: Dalek, The Parting of the Ways) The mutants created using human cells produced small, blue-green creatures, apparently consisting purely of a head, with two eyes and an overall clearer ""face"". (TV: The Parting of the Ways) 

Dalek Sec had lower tentacles that were long enough to grab hold of an adult human and had an unusual, trunk-like appendage that could envelop and carry a whole adult human. (TV: Daleks in Manhattan) 

Mutants of the New Dalek Paradigm had pure Dalek DNA, but still maintained the appearance of other post-Time War mutants.

The problem is you need to consider perspective. People being killed and dying is a bad thing.

However consider this:

Stairs kill 1000 people a year and seriously injure 100,000 people a year. 2000 figure but lets run with it for now.

Citation: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/790609.stm

UK terrorists in London killed 52 people and injured 700.

Lets keep a score from 2005 ok?

50,000 people have been killed by stairs since 2005, 500,000 people have been injured by stairs since 2005 (I too fell down the stairs a few years ago)

Terrorists 52people and 700 injuries.

Stairs are vastly more dangerous than the terrorist threat. Hell if terrorists changed tactics to installing stairs they would be much more effective.

Since you are so afraid of the miniscule terrorism risk and stairs are so much more dangerous will you remove stairs from your home? 

Even when the IRA bombed us we didn't have all this fear mongering and they were getting 100s killed every year.



**Secondly**

If these alerts are for the security and emergency services only. Then why are they publicizing it if not to scare people?  Why publicise it at all? why not just inform the police and security services instead of giving press releases to the main stream media?

Many organisations intentionally euphamise things or have code names in order to prevent panic and fear. For instance in 2005 they called it a 'power surge' to prevent panic. 

This is a list for hospitals:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_emergency_codes#.22Doctor.22_Codes

Dr Armstrong for instance if there is an assault in a hospital.

I think it's a theoretical problem but not a practical one, there don't seem to be large levels of voter fraud in general, and this is one reason that it doesn't often come up as an issue.

One reason for this is maybe that it's quite hard (though obviously still possible) to disrupt things on a large scale with physical votes, you need a concerted effort across a large physical area with a lot of people involved.

 &gt; The highlight of the Holywell week of course, is a trip to the ‘Vic’ hotel, at the top of the high street. There are more lifeforms in there than Mos Eisely cantina, in Star Wars. If you look carefully, you will see that there are two main types- those in wellies and those without. All the local Pubwatch and ASBO celebrities are there; the boys with freshly shaven heads and sporting their best jeans, comparing electronic tags. Similarly, with fewer shaven heads but with numerous boxers’ noses, the girls gather in the shortest skirts, barely disguising the puppy fat and cellulite, dancing round their knock-off handbags and eyeing up the opposition, in a bid to catch the eye of anyone who they havent already shagged in the bus stop/smoking area outside, or anyone who theyre not already related to. 

The entire article is pretty hilarious, but maybe [more accurate than people give it credit](http://www.leaderlive.co.uk/news/103515/-disgracefully-drunk-men-attacked-man-outside-flintshire-pub.aspx). Also, if you look at the comments on the satirical page, lots of people from Holywell just don't get the joke. There are also some possibly informative comments about the quaint town of Holywell::

 &gt; The main problem with Holywell is the strand which is far to close to the High School, I remember kids in my year boasting about having hot knives for breakfast and taking acid tabs at lunch time by the strand shop, this was in 1993 god knows what it is like now. 

 &gt; The men go on a Saturday afternoon to pick up the working girls that have set up there. Every day, in front of the staff, the local drug dealers bring in the custom and sell their good. Wetherspoons love it because it brings in people to their pubs.

Here's an article about it getting re-opened after it was ""forced to shut after outbreaks of violence"" in March 2010. It was actually [voted **Britain's worst pub**](http://leaderlive.co.uk/news/90412/all-change-at-flintshire-club-once-voted-britain-s-worst-pub.aspx).

Even Lampard discussed the situation saying he wanted to play more regularly and whatnot. Sure, he later came out and said he would have accepted an official extension, but he didn't deny that he wanted to be in the starting 11 and frankly, in a club as big as Chelsea, you don't command shit unless you're the best choice in the best form for playing 90 minutes in a given position, and even then you don't have to command anything - you'll play. 

TL;DR: Lamps and Chelsea were in talks for months, he didn't want to be a sub, he didn't get an official extension offer, later he said he would have actually accepted the extension regardless, nobody at the club is a mind-reader, Lamps is still a legend, and this charade will be over in a few months.",null,0,null,1421506389,null,0,false,0,cnrxb2n,null,t3_2snd3f,null,t1_cnrxb2n,null,t1_cnrwy5z,null,null,null,1424826317,null,-1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,-1,null

They weren't politically aware, and often just voted for the one party time and time again.


What we would have with compulsory voting is a similar situation. People simply wouldn't do the research, and their vote would depend on things like family loyalty or peer pressure. Why would you want to re-introduce a system that encourages the 'vote for life' mentality that, thankfully, is now dying out?


Compulsory voting has been tried in many countries, including Italy, Spain, Holland and Austria, and it isn't even enforced in most of the countries where it's still a law.

LOL. I never understood why everyone was spreading rumours about one of our PE teachers. She was a lot older, but she was quite nice and understanding (at least to me anyway, she actually understood the kids that weren't the popular amazing at sports ones). Obviously, the popular ones weren't fond of her really because she didn't pander to them like the keen PE teachers. 

Boys had working showers at my school, the girls didn't - although it was a big communal bit rather than cubicles so maybe they figured it wasn't worth the effort of getting them working again because we'd never use them. Still, i'm glad, I don't think I could've dealt with the potential showering issue. Getting changed was bad enough already!

null,false,chub79,eu,Brittany,null,"In France, the green party ([EELV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe_Ecology_%E2%80%93_The_Greens)) is in an odd position:

* the party is often considered as a sub-group of the Parti Socialist. As they both value social issues, it's quite a natural opinion. However, EELV has become a full fledged party for years now, with its own agenda and policies. 
* there are way to many currents and egos in that party. They keep shooting themselves in the foot over and over again. It doesn't help them and it doesn't help the country. I expect a lot from their new secretary, [Emmanuelle Cosse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuelle_Cosse), though. She is smart and not power-hungry it seems.
* their message is mixed at best. 

Unfortunately, due to this, lots of people don't take them seriously (specially folks above the age of 55 or so).

With that being said, their voice have become more and more heard over the years as people have realised our climate is going to hell. People (well a certain category) also seem to realise over consuming isn't making them that happy no more.

Overall, there is a weird schizophrenia in Europe. People understand we need greener policies as well as make sure the EU provides for its citizens rather than large companies. Yet, they laugh at green parties and keep voting for the same old parties that have screwed us and our climate for decades now. What gives? I mean most policies have massively failed for years and yet we constantly make sure sell out like Cameron are in power.

The green parties are against [TTIP](http://greenparty.org.uk/news/2014/07/11/green-party-ttip-trade-deal-is-a-corporate-power-grab,-that-must-be-stopped/) for instance.

Objectively, Borini has still been pretty bad. 

Not to say he's not playing somewhat of a role in it, but he's looked better than usual as a result of the rest of the side.  

He scored a good goal as a result of a ridiculous pass, but it was not a factor of his famed ""movement"". It was an opportunity served on a silver platter that any good striker would put away. 

He got other opportunities and wasted them. Which is understandable, human after all, but not really on the same page as the rest of the guys,  more like a few chapters back. 

His hustle has won us possession a few times, but what good is that when you just lose the ball immediately after?






He's dug himself such a hole the past few months because of how shit he's been that he needs good consistent performances for the better part of 2 months to even see daylight.

I don't think it's necessarily bad but apprenticeships are just a stopgap measure to keep people out of NEET, off benefits while not having them get paid the minimum wage that might be seen as untenable for the market. Similar efforts can be seen with the governments willingness to pay half an employee's wage for the first year if they've been out of employment for over one year. 

In a similar way to squeezing the working class by having more young people live at home for longer, where the parents usually pay more than their fair share of bills. The young aspiring middle class are being ladened down with more debt than ever. Debt that balances the books very nicely but will have to be payed back at some point causing a real squeeze on people. 

I don't think apprenticeships are a bad idea but when there are obvious political and economic benefits to be had I think there is a pressure to have a large amount of apprenticeships and this can easily be achieved by widening the criteria of what can be an apprenticeship. What's clear whenever stuff like this comes up that there is a broad range of experiences people have had with apprenticeships and I think  this supports a lowering of standards by those in charge of setting those standards even if it doesn't necessarily mean a lowering of standards by those actually hiring apprentices. 

In an ideal world people would just say no to these bad apprenticeships but I think there are many people who's situation doesn't give them that choice.

- 2-3 goals were scored off of really stupid lapses in concentration.

- Chelsea has been ridiculously clinical, even for them.

- Oliveira IS NOT a midfielder. 

- Poor Carroll was expected to be the only shield for our midfield.

Shower hour is immediately after getting your bed turned upside down to get you out of it. You can have extra showers during free time in the evening as well.

At school you're there for 6 hours and you have approximately 10 minutes in which to get changed. Shower time doesn't factor in, because by the time the water's warm you should be fully dressed and out of PE.

I miss cadets, I really do. It's all different now, though. No swearing, no smoking.

He has been linked with many clubs, rumours are a few verbal offers have been made in the past few years, nothing worthwhile. So we allowed his contract to run down instead of forcing a sale by reducing the price. We tried to keep him with an improved deal, he refused, he moved on.

We have no bank-debt, so we can afford to ""over-price"" our players, considering we paid fuck-all for the ones we've sold on.

If you are so correct at this, name some other big examples for us? Russell went for £750k with less than a year left. Robbo went for ~£3m. Gauld £3m+.

We have to overprice players or you lot will keep making pointless derogatory offers for them, much like Rangers did when we were selling Goodwillie, complaining at us rejecting a £1m offer when Blackburn made one of £2.8m, because he ""wanted to play for Rangers"".

Basic economics, it's a buyers market out there, we are a selling club, we want value for money. We have no quibbles with players moving for free, considering they came for free.

Maybe a party that didn't put a candidate there before, or a new party entirely - the thing is they'd very easily get the seat if they properly represented what those people wanted, so it's well worth it.

If all the people who didn't vote due to not feeling any candidate represents them, went out and spoiled their ballots - then we'd have a totally new form of government in this country within an election cycle.

The only reason we keep the status quo is because the main parties *don't* have to pander to the will of the populace *simply because* it is already the case where most people can't be bothered voting.

It's a sad thing, though, that idiots like Russell Brand tell people to *not vote* - when the people who do this are the ones who'd support non-mainstream parties/spoil ballots if they did. He should be telling people to spoil their ballots and thus make their discontent heard and thus result in new parties and candidates to fill in the gap. That's the political revolution he wants, but his method of getting it will never work. If he doesn't want that *or* violent revolution then there's not really an option c anyway.

Oh look, this bill is over £500, we should probably contact the person and see what's going on) - At least either price the data unit reasonably or put a cap on, but don't charge people thousands and expect them to 'pay up'.

It used to be a perfectly respectable way into fairly high levels of the profession. In fact it still is: if you're recruiting for a mechanical engineer, a lot of the time you'd be grateful for a candidate who is also a time-served toolmaker or some such. But like I said there's a cut-off; at some point in time we just stopped creating these people. (There are still apprenticeships, but in smaller quantities, and fewer really good people do them).

It probably coincides with the university expansion, and it's not clearly an awful thing - a moderately bright young lad with an interest these days might go straight into an engineering degree, which is better than being forced into being a shipmaker's apprentice or whatever on grounds of the social class he comes from. But it means he isn't getting the hands-on technical education which the apprenticeship system used to provide, instead getting an (often watered-down) version of highly academic engineering studies.

Almost entertaining that he demonises Farage, mind you;
&gt; In 1993, Sked stood in two parliamentary by-elections, one at Newbury, where he shared a platform with Enoch Powell, who spoke in his support

As for the party's success, well...
&gt; Sked, however, resigned the leadership shortly after the 1997 general election, citing party factionalism and the growing influence of radical, far-right opinion in the party's ranks, saying that it was ""doomed to remain on the political fringes""

Some would say that UKIP have progressed somewhat beyond the political fringes they were on when Sked was their leader.

* We are far too uncomfortable at 1-0 up. Plenty of other teams could easily have converted some of the chances that Villa had today, and we need to keep control of the game in order to survive the inevitable onslaught that follows our first goal.

* For a 5 minute showing, Ibe's looking like he fits well into our system, and I think he'll do well with a few appearances this season.

Tiendalli can fuck off, and we need to bring in two proper full backs and let Jazz go. Get another central midfielder too, if we play another game without Leon and Ki I might just die inside. All this patronising crap about ""oh Bony's leaving, they're in crisis now!"" is just the usual media bullshit surrounding Swansea, the problem today is ridiculous tactics and lack of squad depth.

Markovic did well defensively, he looked really timid when attacking though, I always get the feeling that he'd rather pass the ball instead of taking his man on. Probably a confidence thing, not sure.

Our attacking setup was pretty bad, we played right into their hands. Our front four were too narrow and got crowded out really easily. Of all our attacking players, Chadli was the one who stayed out in the wing the most, which wasn't even a whole lot because he likes to cut in so much. Eriksen's influence on the game was negated by 1)being forced wide, 2) when he did come in, the center was much too crowded. The game was crying out for Townsend in for Soldado - giving Kane and Eriksen space as he would stretch the line. 

Poch's subs were very weird, almost worrisome. He put in Ade when our crossing quality was complete shit. He brought on Townsend, who is emerging as our best crosser of the ball, very late.

Stambouli did so well on the ball and stopped so many attacks. Unsung hero IMO. Can't help but think he'll keep getting better and better. 

Rose stopped everything and was very dangerous going forward. Has definitely made the case to be put back into the first 11. I think a proper rotation will be made for him and Davies to each get good time.

Probably the cheapest and easiest thing to make is turbo cider. 

* Get yourself a 2l bottle of el-cheapo sparkling water and drink it/pour it away, whatever, you want the bottle, not the water.
* Get 2 liters of supermarket basic brand apple juice.
* Pour 1 liter and a half into the 2l bottle, shake a bit, and add some bakers yeast and a tablespoon of sugar. 
* put a balloon over the end of the bottle, be sure to prick the balloon. This will let the CO2 out without letting air in.

There are limited ways of doing that:

1. Get the keys or data from the company
2. Get the keys or data from the customer
3. Enforce an encryption algorithm which can be broken in reasonable time (a weak encryption algorithm or one with backdoors) and let no other algorithm be used. ^edit Arrest anyone who transmits anything else (strong encryption is not discernible from complete garbage).

Ways 1 and 2 don't exist if it's peer to peer.

From someone who isn't even a judge? The home or foreign secretaries?

If there was not a ban, then there would be a safe place.

There would need to be supervision to ensure bullying doesn't happen, and there would need to be enough supervision so that the teachers supervising are well supervised themselves.

Then if there's a great big orgy, bullying, paedophile teachers, or a rash of self-esteem issues with showering by year 10, then the experiment has failed dramatically. I'm betting on kids growing up comfortable with their bodies and those of others, and the only potential issue would be the paedophile teachers, hence the monitoring of them as well.

Even getting changed for swimming was an ordeal as you had to make sure nobody would see anything and watch out for the one twat who would always try and rip peoples boxers off. 

On a few occasions someone got caught naked and that was it they would get bullied ruthlessly for weeks afterwards.

I know one guy who got his shorts pulled down and after that everyone would just hiss at him saying he had a snake. Shit thing is that still happens to him in the pub nine years later.

And then obviously if someone got bullied anyway the changing rooms just allowed the bullies to use their physical appearance as more ammunition. 

Honestly my experience of school changing rooms was toxic where a slip of the towel would resort in you being bullied for a couple of weeks if not more.

*The UK housing crisis is part of wider asset transfer from the state to the rich, writes Will Self*

The statistics bear this out somewhat: we have hit a 25-year low for home ownership. Only 65 per cent of Britons were propertarians in 2012-13, against a giddy peak of 70 per cent in 2003. Meanwhile, the number of people privately renting has doubled in a decade, and landlords have profited by £177bn from capital growth in the past five years.

Where I live, I can see the evidence all around in the form of tower cranes and garish billboards displaying hideously enlarged photographs of gym-toned young people drinking cappuccinos and folding fluffy bath towels. But then I am in the heart of the quartier estate agents have dubbed “Vaux-Ho” (pronounced “Vo-Ho”, to rhyme with Soho): a sliver of south London between the Wandsworth Road and the Thames that in the next 15 years is set to have about 20,000 new apartments land on it, together with the new US embassy and the entire Battersea power station gallimaufry.


These “luxury apartments” will be owned largely by absentee landlords, many of them foreign, who will rent them out to . . . well, possibly to you, dear reader, if you work in the City. Because that is how it works: there can be no renter without a rentier. The idea that we can make a smooth transition from a society in which the homeowner is seen as the metaphoric as well as the literal pillar of the community to one in which everyone rents presupposes we are happy to regard our homes as not only non-fungible but not even transferable; which in turn implies a shift in a range of other cultural values. And I believe cultural values, rather than the mechanical drivers of economic theory, are the operative factors here.


The giveaway of the nation’s council stock under the Thatcher government of the early 1980s was a classic example of the law of unintended consequences. The tinder-dry Hayekians who propped up her own half-timbered façade believed Britons would become thrifty Wemmicks, not only pulling up their miniature drawbridges but spending the long evenings counting and then wisely investing their money. The reality was that most ex-council houses and flats were flipped by those who bought them at a discount; and the network of small-scale rentiers was augmented by those whose income derived from the increased housing benefit the government had to pay ex-council tenants so they could afford to pay higher private-sector rents. The entire exercise consisted in a transfer of capital assets from the state — not to an expanding property owning middle class but to an existing rentier class and its new members.


Meanwhile the bill for social housing continued to mount; it just came in the different form of subsidies to the burgeoning housing associations and the aforementioned benefits. To be blunt: in the past 30 years the prosperity and growth of Britain’s rentier class has been achieved, for the most part, at the direct cost of the least well-off.


Moreover, people have become comfortable with financial and social arrangements that would have struck my parents’ generation as bizarre. Visiting my son at his rented ex-council flat in the heart of London’s hipster district of Hoxton, I was astounded at how sanguine he was about sharing it with his landlord, a close childhood friend who just happened to have won out early in the inheritance lottery and put his capital into concrete and granolithic rendering. My son and the other tenants were working; his friend, at least in the short term, was living off their rent.


My son’s insouciance reflects a change in the underlying dynamic of the British economy. The current housing crisis is not so much emblematic of a transmogrification from a social market economy to a neoliberal one. It is constitutive of that process: the asset transfer from the state to the rich; the pump-priming of the value of those assets; the forcing of the poor into more expensive private rental accommodation — all of which measures are underpinned by a financial system heavily dependent on mortgage lending. Of all British bank loans, 76 per cent are for property, and 64 per cent for residential property alone. Any radical reform of the system entailing a fall in land and house prices would, ipso facto, result in a fundamental destabilisation of the banking system.


It would, in a way, be comforting to see this parlous state of affairs as unprecedented. But, of course, it is not the rack-renting of slum landlords that is a novelty, nor the willingness of capital-rich Britons to happily sit on their rentier backsides while their less well-off fellow citizens go to hell in a wonky handcart knocked up out of rotting MDF. On the contrary: it turns out it was the unprecedented postwar housebuilding boom that was an anomaly. The consuming irony of the entire situation is that our image of ourselves as a nation of Wemmicks — although formed over centuries; blazoned forth by Dickens; and, by the interwar period, apparently embodied in Stanley Baldwin-voting, pipe-smoking paterfamiliases Pooterishly pruning their roses — was in fact achieved only under the postwar council-house-building governments. Yes: in order for a Briton’s home to be his castle, it was necessary that he had an affordable and secure home at all.


The culture of urban living embraced on the continent, whether in the neoclassical appartements of Paris or Berlin’s Mietskasernen (“barracks blocks”), took form in an economy more rooted in mutualism than ours. The stereotype of the nosy Parisian concierge, who knows all the tenants’ business, is in fact a symbol of a style of “urban village” living deeply ingrained in these cultures.


Here in Britain — where demand for new homes means that, if we carry on building at the current rate, every ex­tant house might have to last forever if the population is to be housed — mutualism is, to mix my Dickensian analogies, like Marley’s ghost: rattling the keys for a new dwelling that, paradoxically, exists only in an imaginary past.

Westwood looked ok (not special but let him get back on form), Sanchez was solid, niggling, doing his job. Cleverley uninspired as always. Now, everyone is talking about how shit Delph was, sell him etc. but I think he looked good going forward. Nothing worked for him, but, until the mistake with the goal, his net worth for the team was good. Gil provided the spark that Grealish had been giving the team, but also seemed more in control.

Gabby tried, but hard work can't always make up for a lack of creativity. Benteke looked good. Winning balls in the air and taking shots all over.

I can explain any of my numbers if you're curious why I chose them.

Looking forward, I would love to see a new playmaker coming in to midfield (if we are going to spend more money). 

I think the bast squad we could have would be:

    Hutton-Vlaar-Okore-Cissokho 

            Sanchez

    Delph-Westwood-Cleverley

              Gil

            Benteke

However, I would love it if someone else could fit in to the squad where Cleverley is now. Of course Vlaar is injured so he isn't in now.
Another option would be to move Gil back to where Cleverley is and bring Weimann, N'Zogbia or Agbonglahor in to CF.

There are some independent candidates who do well, but none have the power to change the system.

There is a further problem in expecting all those who spoilt their ballots to suddenly back a single new candidate. Within that 39% (from my earlier example) would be left and right wing, green and non green, UKIP and non UKIP. To think that all those different interests could or would be catered for by a single candidate is not realistic. It would just be a further sub division of the current vote for the least hated.

It would reinforce societal roles; the strong, athletic kids would be singled out and glorified by the teachers while the weaker, disinterested kids (guess which group I was in) would be reminded of their lower social ranking by being picked last week after week. The teachers would spend far more time praising the capable kids rather than working with the kids who struggled and needed something other than negative reinforcement . Spare kit was kept unwashed and if there was none left you were sometimes made to perform in your underwear. There were 8 shower cubicles for 20 male students to use in less than 10 minutes, so they were never used. 

Just everything about it was the worst part of the week. My main P. E. teacher eventually moved to Nashville from Manchester to become a professional country and western songwriter. Up to that point she seemed to direct her creative energy into being a dick in every interaction I ever saw her have with people. She never taught me anything other than how the bleep test worked and the rules of the dumb, made up ball games we had to play. 

It's not that hard to imagine how someone in that role could be a positive presence in a kids life. Bolstering confidence rather than letting 80% of the class resent athleticism.

You will hear many arguments. Some say to leave it on to keep the house at a constant temperature to lower the bills, others say to have it come on only when you're there. In the end a lot of research was done into this and only having it on when you're there is the winner. There is a caveat to that in that you need to have the house at least warm enough to ensure the pipes don't freeze.

null,false,Peli-cant,null,null,null,"We can't expect to win that game, but we can't expect to lose like that.

Our biggest issue today was the lack of a defensive midfielder.  We allowed 165 passes from Chelsea in our attacking third, at least half of those were in front of the centrebacks.  Almost 10 chances created were received or passed from this area.  We can't rely on Carroll or Sigurdsson (who won't defend anyway) to fill this void.  I know we need fullbacks, but we need a defensive midfielder over both of those positions.  This player needs to be able to sit in front of the defense and be able to facilitate the transfer from defense to offense, which is where we lost the ball throughout the game.  I feel that if we had closed down this space, we wouldn't be in the situation that we are.

Secondly, our fullbacks are awful.  This should be Tiendalli's last league game as a Swan.  The fact that we went into this game thinking that Dwight Tiendalli could handle Eden Hazard is somewhat ridiculous.  Hazard had 6 key passes and 2 shots on target today.  I don't think that Kyle Naughton is necessarily the answer either, but we need to act quickly.

Thirdly, Oliveira isn't an attacking midfielder.  I don't know if Garry intended a 4-4-2 or a 4-2-3-1, but I would much rather have had Gylfi in the 10 and Amat sat in front of the CB's.

He bought one of those townhouses on the government's 20% equity loans. So a £500K 3br townhouse ""only"" cost him £400K. That's somewhat out of my reach but, if you can afford it, it doesn't look like a bad place to live and I reckon it's a reasonable investment in the long run.

I had a good feeling about the place and the chances are your neighbours will be some fairly wealthy and well-connected people. Not a bad place if you're in to social networking.

First, from a cold-hearted view, you would need to prove that obesity related diseases and deaths cost more than old-age related care.

I have a suspicion that people who die of heart attacks and other avoidable illnesses through poor lifestyle choices probably cost us less than the care they would use for the extra 15 - 20 years they could have lived if it had been avoided (Assuming we actually funded this sort of care properly). If this is so, then making people healthier arguably will cost us more in the long term rather than letting people make mistakes. 

Second - how would you consider someone 'fat'? If someone has heart disease but is only just over your defined threshold, do you just say 'sod it anyway' and go all in on the taxes? At what point does something even become medical and not of your own choice? There are way too many variables in that earlier lifestyle choices you opted out of could have ramifications down the line.

Third - The largest issue I see with the NHS is structural. We don't have the staffing or the funding provided to cover the staffing we would need to look after 100% of the population.

The fundamental flaw is the presumption that all the weight gain is personal choice to consume luxuries. Let's say for example that a business decides to use an additive in a product that can cause weight gain in many people, but it's cheap. So the end result is cheaper food but with increased health costs to the consumer. Those people on a tighter budget who want this product are more likely to fit the less healthy option into their budget, in turn making them more likely to be obese and then would in turn be charged for 'lifestyle choices'.

Excise duties on things like cigarettes are there to ensure that when a smoker has surgery that they have essentially already essentially paid so it doesn't put the burden on the rest of society. It also ensures that being done this way they won't have to pay at the same time they are having their surgery so the NHS is still free at the point of use.

With obesity it isn't so simple. You can't just put a tax on high sugar or high fat food because it's a matter of ""calories in &gt; calories out"". You can be obese even if you eat nothing but lean chicken breast and whole-wheat bread as long as you eat more than you're burning. So what's left, a tax per calorie?!?

The Gallup Organization took an opinion poll at the end of April and found that 74 per cent agreed with what Powell had said in his speech; 15 per cent disagreed. 69 per cent felt Heath was wrong to sack Powell and 20 per cent believed Heath was right. Before his speech Powell was favoured to replace Heath as Conservative leader by 1 per cent, with Reginald Maudling favoured by 20 per cent; after his speech 24 per cent favoured Powell and 18 per cent Maudling. 83 per cent now felt immigration should be restricted (75 per cent before the speech) and 65 per cent favoured anti-discrimination legislation.[24]



The day after the speech Powell went to Sunday Communion at his local church and when he emerged there was a crowd of journalists and a local plasterer (Sidney Miller) said to Powell: ""Well done, sir! It needed to be said.


1,000 London dockers had gone on strike in protest at Powell's sacking and marched from the East End to the Palace of Westminster carrying placards saying ""Don't knock Enoch"" and ""Back Britain, not Black Britain"". 300 of them went into the Palace, 100 to lobby the MP for Stepney, Peter Shore, and 200 to lobby the MP for Poplar, Ian Mikardo. Shore and Mikardo were shouted down and some dockers kicked Mikardo. Lady Gaitskell shouted: ""You will have your remedy at the next election."" The dockers replied: ""We won't forget.""[19] The organiser of the strike, Harry Pearman, headed a delegation to meet Powell and said after: ""I have just met Enoch Powell and it made me feel proud to be an Englishman. He told me that he felt that if this matter was swept under the rug he would lift the rug and do the same again. We are representatives of the working man. We are not racialists.""[20]



On 24 April 600 dockers at St Katharine's Docks voted to strike and numerous smaller factories across the country followed. 600 Smithfield meat porters struck and marched to Westminster and handed Powell a 92-page petition supporting him. Powell advised against strike action and asked them to write to Harold Wilson, Heath or their MP. However, strikes continued, reaching Tilbury by 25 April and he allegedly received his 30,000th letter supporting him, with 30 protesting against his speech. By 27 April, 4,500 dockers were on strike. On 28 April, 1,500 people marched to Downing Street chanting ""Arrest Enoch Powell"".[21] Powell claimed to have received 43,000 letters and 700 telegrams supporting him by early May, with 800 letters and four telegrams against.[22] On 2 May, the Attorney-General, Sir Elwyn Jones, announced he would not prosecute Powell after consulting the Director of Public Prosecutions.

null,false,whitepalms85,null,null,null,"&gt; you can be an apprentice for anything

If this is true, then the UK total misunderstands how apprenticeship works in e.g. Germany or Switzerland. Most people there start an apprenticeship with 16, it's usually three years and includes 1-2 days of school. There are tests in school but also practical tests (e.g. a cook apprentice is tested whether he/she can cook certain meals). You can just hire anyone and call everything an apprenticeship. It's a regulated education. You need a 'master craftsmen' certificate to even be allowed to hire apprentice and a business has to guarantee certain standards (e.g. that the apprentice can work in different departments, learn different skills... ). Also the whole schooling aspect is organized by the government. They decided (in agreement with the businesses) what type of apprenticeships exists. E.g. there's a 'restaurant apprenticeship' but there's certainly no 'dishwasher apprenticeship' and you wouldn't be allowed to make someone wash dishes for three years.

Some apprenticeships seem a bit silly (e.g. there's a retail apprenticeship in Switzerland, but every student can work their after 2 hours of training or so) but their purpose is that those people get some formal job education so that they still have the possibility to work their way up in better jobs where you actually need some skills (e.g. being in charge of a branch).

&gt; **How and why the fortunes of England’s two ancient university towns diverged**

&gt; THEIR rivalry is most vividly expressed each spring, when two boats splash up the River Thames. They compete for brilliant academics and for the aura of intellectual superiority that draws the cleverest students to their colleges. But Cambridge and Oxford also compete in more prosaic ways—as cities and as economies, as places to live and to set up businesses. And here there is no real competition.



&gt; Over the past few years Cambridge has added many more workers, highly educated residents and well-paid jobs than Oxford (see chart). Last October 40 Oxford councillors, academics and business leaders went to Cambridge to see how it handles urban problems such as housing and transport. That provoked joshing from the Cambridge local press about its rival going “back to school”, but also a frank acknowledgment of how far the cities’ fortunes have diverged. “Cambridge is at least 20 years ahead of Oxford,” admits Bob Price, the leader of Oxford City Council.

&gt; Both cities are wealthy and pretty. They are both about 60 miles from London, along fairly good train lines. Both are constrained by large “green belts” in which it is almost impossible to build houses. Both have Labour-led city councils. But there are big differences between Oxford and Cambridge, too—in topography, regional politics and priorities—and these help to explain the gap in performance.

&gt; Whereas the land around Cambridge is flat and boring, much of Oxfordshire is rolling and gorgeous. It attracts wealthy, powerful residents who want to keep it that way. Oxford is surrounded by four different districts, run by Conservative politicians who do not all want to see an expansion of the city onto their land. Nor do they regard Oxford’s economic growth as their priority. Cambridge is surrounded by just one district, Tory-led South Cambridgeshire, whose councillors know on which side their bread is buttered.

&gt; In 2014 an assessment commissioned by the city council from URS, a consultancy, found that Oxford needed to build up to 32,000 new houses by 2031. The city says it has space for only about 10,200 of these, so the rest should be spread among the four rural districts. They question the numbers and say Oxford has not done enough to build in the city. They cannot see that Oxford’s unmet housing need holds back the prosperity of the whole county, laments Mr Price.

&gt; Companies complain that the exorbitant cost of housing is making it hard to hold onto workers. In 2014 the average Oxford home cost 11.3 times average local earnings. That is the biggest discrepancy in Britain: the average is 5.8 times. Each day 46,000 people commute into the city, which has a population of 150,000. And yet local businesses have not managed to persuade local politicians to deal with their problems.

&gt; Cambridge, with 125,000 people, is quite different. Decades ago a few visionary academics proposed that the city should convert its boffinry (and especially its comparative strength in the sciences) into wider regional prosperity. In the 1970s Trinity College opened the Cambridge Science Park; the St John’s Innovation Centre followed in 1987. A whole ecosystem emerged, combining local government and business and then investors, all driven by the university. This success has also created housing and transport pressures, and property is expensive in Cambridge, too. But Cambridge built 1,020 homes in 2014—three times as many as in 2009. Oxford built just 60 last year.

&gt; Cambridge’s most recent housing plan, published in conjunction with South Cambridgeshire council, is for 14,000 new homes in the city and 19,000 in the county. There is some opposition to this—but, says Lewis Herbert, head of Cambridge City Council, because only 3% of the new houses will be in the green belt, so far most parties have signed on. “The key to preserving the green belt is getting the other stuff right,” he says. He is pouring money into improving transport links and other infrastructure for the surrounding area, assisted by a “city deal”, a central-government scheme that gives large dollops of cash to local authorities that boost growth.

&gt; The University of Oxford has not been as forward-looking as its ancient rival, although Mr Price says he has seen a change under the current vice-chancellor, Andrew Hamilton. The university is now much more involved in decision-making, he says. Like local businesses, it has realised, belatedly, that the housing shortage affects its ability to attract world-class academics as well as technicians and cleaners.

&gt; What the city, and the county, now need is someone to provide a strategic overview and then to bang heads together to push it through. None of the districts in Oxfordshire is big or powerful enough to do so. Some politicians point to the example of Manchester, where 10 local councils have joined together, creating efficiencies financially and in urban planning. But they are all part of a single metropolis.

&gt; It is just possible that, if the councils cannot work out a solution, Westminster might intervene and merge the city, district and county levels to form a unitary regional government. “Working better together now will build a strategic defence against being forced into unitary government,” argues Keith Mitchell, a retired head of Oxfordshire County Council.

&gt; More broadly, Oxford’s travails go to the heart of the problems with England’s planning system. “Development is seen as a bad thing in this country and planning is there to stop it,” says David Rudlin, a planner whose design for solving Britain’s housing woes won the Wolfson prize, a prestigious economics award. He says Cambridge is doing much better, though even it could learn from a place like Freiburg, a German university town that has used town extensions and trams to solve similar problems. What is needed is an overhaul of both the planning system and the green belt policy. But it does not require a DPhil from the University of Oxford to see how difficult that is going to be.",null,0,null,1421524165,null,0,false,0,cns5c2f,null,t3_2srd0c,null,t1_cns5c2f,null,t3_2srd0c,null,null,null,1424822439,null,7,false,oxford,t5_2rc7b,7,null

And the government can't try and keep it secret because of the obvious ""secret government terror levels revealed!""-style headlines it would generate.

They also have to prove that they advertised the vacancy for a set period of time and were unable to find any workers within the UK and EU that could fulfil the requirement before they hired you instead, so it's an administrative pain for them.

Most UK employers will ask on the application if you have the right to work in the UK, and as you don't I'm afraid many of them will have to turn you down.

To apply for work in the UK, an employer needs to advertise the position to *everyone* in the UK and the EU first. That's a huge amount of people that you are competing with. And even so, the border agency only gives out 20,000 VIAS's per year, and prioritise jobs that are on the [shortage occupation list](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tier-2-shortage-occupation-list-from-6-april-2013).

The other option is to get a job with a US firm which has a UK office, and apply for a transfer. The company will have to sponsor you, but it is a lot easier than getting in the former way. 

Theres simply no other way to work in the UK. If you come over on a holiday VISA (a working-holiday VISA is not available to US citizens) you **are not permitted to work**, and if you do and are caught you are deported and banned from entering the UK for ten years. Even on this VISA, you need to absolutely prove to the UK Border Agency you have enough savings to support yourself, and can only stay here for a few months maximum.  

If you have UK citizenship through a parent, then moving is a lot easier. But without it, your chances are slim-to-none.

I've never bought into the economic arguments for legislating for the Irish language.

There are Shinners sitting in pretty much every community organisation and social enterprise in west Belfast anyway. Thats not the fault of the Irish language, its a language not a person.

Secondly, for me, its not about economic impact. A society is not a true society if it cannot protect its heritage, culture and history (and yeah, that goes for orange culture too). The Irish language is integral to our culture and our rich history going back centuries. To be against it because of a perceived lack of economic incentive is ignorant and backward, considering we spend a fortune on other things that are economically worthless in defence of cultural capital and rights - I'll point you in the direction of the Ulster orchestra, or in an extreme example, that protest camp near Ardoyne.

The DUP are against it for one reason and one reason only; they dont like Irish culture and want nothing to do with it in their wee country. Arguing about the economics of it is pure fluff.

 * Possible damage to ecosystems when other species are contaminated.  
 * Possible damage to biodiversity.
 * Herbicide resistance.
 * Contamination of non-GM crops.

It is highly dubious to label an entire agricultural practice as good or bad.  You are using science to make personal attacks against people you disagree with.  It is like saying that someone is antu-Christian because they support abortion.

Taking a cautionary approach to a complicated matter is not anti-scientific.  Using science as a prop in your argument is distinctly unscientific.

&gt;EN261 We will cancel construction of new nuclear stations and nuclear power will not be eligible for government subsidy; the Green Party opposes all nuclear power generation and is particularly opposed to the construction of new nuclear power stations


That to me is beyond belief.

Nuclear power is THE closest thing to clean power we can get, it's energy dense, all the benefits of traditional fossil fuel burning power stations.  Wind, tidal, hydro, solar whatever, it doesn't matter because they are not mature enough to deliver power on a whim and at sufficient levels.  For Wind Power you would need somewhere in the reigion of 10,000 wind turbines to equal one nuclear power station (providing there is enough wind 100% of the time) If the wind slows down by half, your energy output decreases by 8 times, so 10-30% is the industry real life average.  Meaning you would need 100,000-70,000 Wind Turbines to equal one nuclear power plant.


Don't listen to me, listen to those pesky scientists who say Nuclear is the best form of energy available right now.

Also you numbers on wind turbines are a bit fishy.  London Array makes 630MW with 175 turbines which at 40% capacity is roughly 700 turbines for a one 1 GW nuclear station.  New models could achieve 15MW which would give 1GW @ 40% for just 175 turbines.  

Current nuclear power stations are not a good replacement for gas turbines.  We need a source of power that can turn on very quickly and nuclear station tend to take a while to start up.  You could run them as spinning reserve of course.

I can't think of many issues that could be neatly boiled down to yes/no statements; a question like ""Do you support immigration into Britain"" or ""do prisoners have too many rights"" are way too broad and loaded to be useful, most people and politicians have more complicated solutions and stances for these.

Also the issue of which questions are asked, how many are asked, the wording, and who decides which party gets a +1 for each answer? Also, I reckon this would also have all the same issues that comes with [range voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_voting). What about voters who just want to vote for one party regardless?

I do agree that *some* rental market is a positive thing. Encouraging a mobile work-force to a point has benefits for the state. Sparing **low** earners from the burden of mortgage debt is also good. 

Property ownership is however essential to provide the security youngsters need to have children. And there, my dinosaur, is the problem. Renting **isn't** about your income or your personal needs... It's about your age. And the simple fact is, short of parents willing to gift you a deposit, it's extremely difficult to buy a house if you're under 35. The harsh reality is if you're renting in you're late 20s it feels like you've missed the bandwagon. To my mind that has to be redressed.

A German style tenant favouring legal reform would establish the right of the tenant more clearly. Personally I think compulsory landlord registration is also needed. Furthermore, archaic principles (like the right of landlords to prohibit pets, or redecorating) should be legislated against if the industry can't modernise. Most importantly, landlords need to pay more tax. Lots more tax. The idea being to cut the obscene profit margins you scum are making and force the market to ""professionalise""... By which I mean effect a shift from one-man, one property BTLers that make up the bulk of the current market towards companies, owning dozens or hundreds of properties and acting as both an agent, landlord and repair service - more like the US market.

null,false,mr-strange,null,null,null,"&gt; Property ownership is however essential to provide the security youngsters need to have children.

This is just nonsense. (Most of) the rest of Europe is far more sane. The weird British obsession with home ownership is a big part of the *problem* with the UK housing market. Right now, prices are stupidly high, and demand would be rock bottom in any sane market. Lack of supply helps to prop prices up *a bit*, but the main problem is that people who see things your way *still* want to buy - seemingly whatever the price.

&gt; Most importantly, landlords need to pay more tax. Lots more tax.

I don't think the tax rates are the problem. It would more useful to arrange for landlords to *make less money*. You fix that by cutting down on the stupid capital gains that they can make. If most of the profits came from the lettings fees, then *amazingly* landlords might start paying more attention to making their customers happy. As it stands, many property owners make most of their money from capital gains, and the tenants are often seen as a barely worthwhile annoyance.

&gt; It also goes without saying that lettings agent fees absolutely need to be comprehensively banned.

I don't actually think that letting agents charge unreasonable fees. They make far less money doing lettings than they can make on a sale, and dealing with a letting is actually more work for them. (Typical sale fee: 1% of market value, typical letting fee: 0.3% of market value.) It would be perfectly reasonable to make them charge the landlord, rather than prospective tenants, because the landlord is usually going to be more able to pay a lump sum - but the tenant will wind up paying it in the end, in the form of slightly increased rent, so the difference is only one of convenience, rather than anything fundamental.

I think you need to cite a source for that. The fact remains that a tax on carbs or fatty foods would be *far* easier to implement, and I would bet very good money that it would provide more money for the NHS than taxing the obese, since healthy people will continue to buy junk food as well.

Look at smoking, it provides vast amounts of money through tax (more than the average smoker costs the NHS) which is easily added on to a pack of B&amp;H. If we tried taxing smokers themselves, we would have to prove who is or isn't a smoker (or in this case obese) which would create huge administration issues before it had even begun.

For me the Games Programming degree was actually just the standard Comp Sci degree but with some of the elective modules pre-selected, and a requirement to have your final dissertation/project be in the field of games dev. I understand this is still the same setup for a lot of universities that offer for a games dev degree, which makes a switch a simple thing to do. Switching to Comp Sci for me was as simple as going to the lecturer who ran the Computer Science degree track and asking him, he had a form that I took 2 minutes to fill, he signed it and that was it done.

I ended up doing all of the games development electives apart from AI, then my final dissertation was not games related.

I'd absolutely suggest phoning or emailing the head of the Comp Sci course and then phoning admissions for the university to try and make the change early but if you're unable to make the change beforehand you may find it easier to make once after/during the first year, if this is the way your course is organised.

By this time we had found out he was not going with England to the World Cup and obviously he would be upset by that. It was almost like he thought he was too good for the MLS in general. 

Injures started to plague Defoe by the summer, he was actually in England for much of the time trying to recover. That's when all of a sudden apparently even his mother was pushing Defoe to come back to England. (Seriously. You're own mother deciding your career?) Another big problem is apparently Defoe wasn't getting along with the current staff, Ryan Nelsen and whoever his guys were. Granted, Nelsen is a fucking idiot anyways and I've never trusted him with leading TFC. 

Around mid-August we started to hear rumours, from reliable journalists in Toronto, that he wanted a move back to England. QPR was reported to want him. We could have sold him there but realistically it made zero sense. He was close to returning and we were on a playoff run to try and make them for the first time under new head coach Greg Vanney. Now I thought since Nelsen is finally gone (Thank heavens) he might actually stay. Upon returning he addressed much of the speculation [which can be viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF5tf8hi73E)

We ended not making the playoffs that season which now extends our current run to 7 seasons. A broken promise to TFC fans everywhere. Frustration is building among our fan base. 

So did fans like Defoe? Duh. Actually he even got involved in our community. [Here's a video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeqjJpU3Ryw) [Actually, have another.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ac8rRhRz8) The whole 'Bloody Big Deal' skyrocketed our season ticket sales and, despite only being able to make a few games this season myself due to not living in the country anymore, from what I saw the amount of jerseys and t-shirts with the Defoe 18 on them is mind boggling. Fans loved the guy! When all this speculation started happening you have to understand our supporters POV here. We all wanted to love him, but when he blatantly says I want a move out of Toronto what are we supposed to do? He was our biggest signing ever and it came with all this promise of playoffs and success, something we've had very little of in our 7 years of existence. I think his lack of ambition really caused a fallout among his teammates too. We were paying him $90k USD a week which is big bucks for someone playing in the MLS. At first he looked 100% committed to TFC, but eventually it didn't look or seem that way and you're going to lose friends in the team that way. 

So what did he do? Said the wrong things, lost the plot, had *way* too close ties with his mom who clearly didn't want to be in Toronto anymore (We're so friendly, I don't know what the fuck we did.) and didn't do anything to help this issue.

People should go into an apprenticeship knowing that its gonna be poor pay but good qualifications at the end, stuff that future employers will value.
Apprenticeship companies are amazing, Everyone has seen the website where you just click a few buttons and fill out a form to become and apprentice but a specialized company are alot better to go with. As I said before I am in the IT field and did this through a company who helped me throughout the process, be it qualifications, teaching, interview skills and just general support and guidance.

The current minimum pay is 150£ a week (for every apprenticeship in England as far as I know) and this is more than enough, for a young adult to live off per week. I was on 150£ and it allowed me to travel in and out of London everyday, buy my own food, pay rent and have some money at the end for myself or saving. Employers can choose to pay more and are prompted to do so as the year of employment goes on.

Employers do see it as cheap work but you need to remember that the apprentice gets more out of it aswell, We get a sense of what a workplace is like, experience on the job and get taught to do something you hopefully enjoy.

Duration: It's only a year, really not that bad.

Lastly, If people go into the apprenticeship programme then there are loads of people out there willing to help, the apprentice just needs to look for them.

Step 1 - He said something stupid and outrageous. Inventing a crisis - OMG TERRRRISTS USE ENCRYPTION! WE NEED TO BAN IT! But it's ok, I, David Cameron, will save the people from these naughty encryption-using terrorists! I'll show those cheeky scamps what-for! Just hand over your privacy for a little more security. Or else we'll throw you in prison, terrorist.

Step 2 - ""Oh well a whitelist doesn't sound too bad"".  It doesn't actually solve any problems. Criminals will still use encryption, 'terrorists' will still use encryption, the only people directly harmed will be private, law abiding citizens. Businesses will have extra burdens placed upon them and government will have to service all that red tape. Why does our government *hate* private, law abiding citizens so much? Why does it want to spy on them all the time? Why are they always the ones who are most negatively impacted by laws like this? If I was a tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theorist, I'd say the government didn't like the public very much and sought to suppress it. Haha. Good thing I'm not though.

Hopefully there's no Step 3.

It can therefore guarantee a very large unvarying energy output which is ideal for a stable grid. It's true that it isn't the best technology for load following and that gas is superior for in that regard but it isn't impossible with nuclear either as France has proven.

Solar and wind are definitely part of the solution but they can't provide a constant output as they depend on forces we cannot control. They could easily put out a lot of energy (sunny/strong winds) as they could none (night/calm). They should instead be used to ""top up"" the energy mix.

Another problem with wind is that failing turbines can have a knock on effect on the frequency of the array's output which could potentially cause instabilities across the grid if it varies too far from 50Hz. You only have one turbine to worry about with a gas or nuclear plant.

My beef with the second part isn't necessarily that they are left wing, but they are guided, on environmental issues, more by their pseudo-socialist values than environmental concerns. I get the impression that they just don't like the idea of humans getting richer, having more material wealth or free enterprise, on a completely philosophical basis, rather than any actual harm to the environment. I get the impression that a lot of Greens are against a whole host of things because big companies do them, even if they aren't particularly detrimental to the environment.


Edit; I do realize that the party is in its adolescence, transitioning from a fringe idealistic movement to a potentially serious one, and my opinions of the party are probably a bit outdated. I don't mean to say *all* greens hate business and material wealth, I mean that's just the broad impression I get from the party's more vocal advocates.

First of all, it was a counterattack, so by the very nature of it he was behind play and therefore has a very poor view of the situation. But mainly, he had about 8 other players to look at, and whether one individual player was across the line or not was probably, understandably, the last thing on his mind. 
As for the linesman, it's pretty inexcusable. It is probably hard in the heat of the moment, as their main job is just to tell quickly if a player was past the defender or not.

Capita

A major contractor is Capita[14] which specialises in outsourcing for government projects. Capita is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the TV Licence fee.[12][15] It is expected that Capita will earn £1.10bn – £1.55bn from its contract with the BBC if it runs its maximum 15 years from July 2012.[9]

Capita's TV Licensing headquarters is based at India Mill, in Darwen, Lancashire.[16] Capita employs a number of subcontractors for part of its TV licensing operations – one important one being Computer Sciences Corporation which provides and modernises the required IT infrastructure.[9] Since 2004, Capita has undertaken a proportion of TV licensing administration at locations outside of the UK and 'has progressively increased the amount of work processed overseas each year'.[9] However as of 2013, Capita has not set up any overseas call centres to carry out TV Licensing work and it would need the BBC's permission to do so in the future.[9] Some of Capita's TV Licensing work is carried out in Mumbai, India.[17]

The exact rules will vary; in most places where you can do an extra module, it will either count equally (so that if you normally do 10, the 11th makes each module count as one 11th, rather than a 10th), or will replace the lowest module of it's level.  The latter is rarer; given that it allows the loophole you've outlined - generally it only happens in places that have quite limited options for when you can take additional modules.

&gt;

&gt;__Blood or Whiskey__ is an Irish punk/folk band from [Leixlip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leixlip), [County Kildare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Kildare), [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland). The band was formed in September 1993 taking strong influence from [Shane MacGowan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_MacGowan), as well as [The Pogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pogues) and [The Clash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clash). The band originally had problems with their non-traditional music style among native Irish fans and released their first album *Blood or Whiskey* in 1996. Several years of touring followed before the release of *No Time to Explain* which was followed by a tour of the [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States).

&gt;After the leaving of their original lead singer, Barney Murray, in 2003, guitarist Dugs Mulhooly took over the reins as the band's frontman, Blood or Whiskey's lineup underwent many changes and in 2005 released *Cashed Out on Culture*, which is highly regarded as their most punk oriented of their albums, although it maintains the driving traditional melodies that are trademarks of the band's sound. In 2006, whistle player Alan Confrey died from a heart attack after the band returned home to [Dublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin) after a [UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK) tour with [Stiff Little Fingers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff_Little_Fingers).

&gt;The band is currently looking for a new tin whistle player and were due to release their new album on [Punkcore Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punkcore_Records) sometime in late 2007, however, this was pushed back to a non-specified date. They have also recently recruited a new bass player, Peter Mullan, and toured [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) in September 2006, supporting [The Misfits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misfits_(band\)) on some shows. The tour has been entitled ""Back from the Brink"" by the band. The band also supported The Pogues at their annual Christmas gig in the RDS, Dublin on the 23rd of December, 2007.

But that issue is that the training costs, travel costs, accommodation etc. for playing on the tour are the same regardless of gender. It's no easier to be a female tennis player, so there's no logical reason for women to be paid less.

Someone, is concerned about the quality of chocolate in the shops.

It is cheap, tastes bad and is really no good at all.

However, because of a shortage of cocoa beans, that is what people are prepared to buy.

Our friend,though. decides to change the law so that only the highest quality chocolate can be sold.

He expects to have ended chocolate exploitation and that the consumers of confectionery will be able to get value again.

Of course, things didn't work out like that-the new super bars were incredibly expensive and very few people could afford them.

Soon, a black market in cheap, low quality bars emerged.

The difference,though, was that because it was illegal, the prices become higher than in the old days due to a shortage of suppliers.

As you say, actor age is going to be an issue but Alex Kingston, Freema and Catherine Tate (if they do find a way to let Donna appear, perhaps in a non-companion very minor 'blink and you miss it' performance) will still be young(ish) so here's hoping. Also you raise another good point with the his/her thing-at which number will we see the first female Doctor? (based on the Missy/Master thing I'm guessing not too long, maybe number fourteen or fifteen hopefully). Maybe Number Fourteen adopts a face from the past (as Twelve seems to have done from Caecilus) and adopts a face of a former companion. I do like Martha so it'd be great if Freema would be up for it but I could also understand if she didn't want to. Plus as progressive and forward-thinking as Doctor Who is, I'm still not sure they'd make a new Doctor both black and female at once, some people may see it as too much of a change. I'd also love to see a new Doctor 'take the face' of Clara seeing as how she's been throughout his whole timestream, if of course they ever go down this route.

null,false,Brapfamalam,null,null,null,"It's not just the content that's simpler, its the modular nature and re-takes. GSCE's are a joke, but A levels are easier too. I ended up getting an A* in A level Biology without actually getting 90%, I think I got 87%, but because of UMS which scales up your raw mark to a percentage grade boundary for each separate module, I ended up comfortably within the line for an A*. 

I did my GCSE's in 2008 with edexcel mostly and the modules were tiny, especially for science and maths. You could retake each module from fourth year (year 10) at each exam date, January, March and May/June going up to the end of Fifth year(year 11). Our school made us retake unless we got 85% or above so in the end for sciences and Maths practically everyone in the year had an A* or A. I think it was 80% A* for sciences. 

Also because the content is so small for each module, a specification/syllabus that spoon feeds you the exam content, and for each module you get a specimen paper with exam questions before the first exam, essentially what a lot of us did was not try for the first exam and then we'd have a pool of about 90% of all the questions they could ask in the re-take - because guess what, Edexcel released past papers from the previous exam date before the next one came up so you could essentially predict what questions and content would come up. 

Sciences and Maths were the worst, but most subjects were like this by the time we did it except English. It was practically all laid out for you to get an A* in every subject and most of our year did. I don't know how retaking exams works in state schools and paying for them though. 

I remember looking at my Sisters paper's, who is 9 years older at the time, and the content was noticeably harder and much more dense never mind the kind of modular exams we had not existing. As well as UMS, UMS makes it ridiculously easy to coast by. I had a bit of a shock in my first year at uni. The modular nature and re-taking makes it way too easy, especially when Oxbridge and other top Unis deliberately avoid that for many degree streams.
