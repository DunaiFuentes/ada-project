Aside from that though I imagine FSG will not make a decision based on the Stoke result, we all know games like this can happen and to sack someone for that alone would be irresponsible.

Just to list a few, going back to the end of last season;

The 3-3 against Crystal Palace and giving up a 3-0 advantage. The loss to Chelsea when a draw would have been acceptable. The results against Ludogrets and Basel in the Champions League. The loss against Besiktas in the Europa League (arguably the type of teams you would expect Liverpool to be able to beat in Europe).The loss against Aston Villa in the semi-final of the FA Cup and to a maybe lesser extent the loss to Chelsea in the League Cup. The loss to Man Utd when chasing for 4th spot and subsequent slip-ups to make it to the top 4.

another argument for not firing rodgers? do you want to spend 10m on firing him, or would you rather that go into buying players who can help the squad? seriously, tell me...you act like there are no consequences for firing someone with 10m guaranteed left on his contract.

No. Bus lanes do NOT segregating different types of traffic for safety reasons. A bus is the same as a coach, or HGV or lorry. The only reason bus lanes are there is to allow busses to operate during rush hour without getting stuck in traffic.

&gt;What do you think would happen if you removed the central dividing line from roads?

Lots and lots of roads, including national speed limit roads (60mph), do not have central dividing lines. As I've already explained, that line is not necessary nor required for a road to be safe.

Yeah just as soon as we require people to take compulsury pavement/cycling lessons and require them to pass a test before they use them.

Bear in mind, the way FSG handled their manager Terry Francona was shambolic. He won two titles after 86 years of failure but after that he had some horrible luck with injuries and results, so FSG undercut him for months, fired him without having any capable replacement available, and then tried to peddle a ridiculous story in the press that the manager was abusing painkillers and his personal life was in shambles because he got divorced. 

After that, they wound up hiring a joke of a manager who had been drummed out of the league for years and was most famous for getting thrown out of a game and trying to sneak back in wearing a costume. You all probably remember this clown from the Fox documentary about LFC from a few years back. That season was so unbelievably bad. If baseball was set up like the EPL, the Red Sox would have been relegated with weeks to go. And they won the title the very next year, so it's not like the squad sucked. The Red Sox had one of the highest payrolls in the league. Attendance plummeted and the Red Sox once went years selling out every game. It was a true debacle. 

Point being - I think that FSG learned from that experience and will not fire BR unless they have someone better ready to take over.   I don't think that manager is available at the moment, so I expect BR to get another year. But I'm sure they're putting their feelers out for a replacement.

In terms of your specific question about Help To Buy phase 2, have a read of http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgages/mortgage-schemes#help2.  The key point though is:
&gt; And that’s pretty much all you really need to know. If you've only got a 5% deposit, you need to look for a 95% LTV loan. Some will be funded through Help to Buy, others won’t.

&gt; To you that’s irrelevant, what counts are the fees, rate and terms. So if the best 5% deposit mortgage is Help to Buy, and it's right for you, great, go for it, if it’s not, go for the other. The fact it's Help to Buy gives YOU no greater or lesser comfort.

Does that looks a bit like what you are after?

Edit: Another thing to remember is that houses are expensive when they break, and they do break.  Try to have 6 months (if you can) worth of salary in a fairly rapid access account somewhere for when the roof fails and you have to pay thousands to get it replaced **now**.

If you went to Southampton and studied Ocean Science then you'll be spending a lot of time in the National Oceanography Centre, and all your lecturers will be active researchers.

This can be good and bad. On the one hand a good researcher is not always a good teacher, and of course if they have a cruise (or are away at conferences), you may have to work damn hard to get in front of your tutor if you need a meeting.

On the flip side it means you're studying in the same building where cutting edge research is taking place, and even as an undergrad you may get access to equipment and resources which a solely teaching institution could not possibly afford or justify (but which a Russell Group uni has for it's research contracts, and which an undergrad *may* be able to get limited time on for 3rd year projects, dissertations, etc).

Since you're not British and I haven't seen their international fees, I can't speak to expense - university fees are capped at £9k/yr for Brits, and almost every university - Russell Group or not - goes up to that limit, so whether you want to study English (which requires no special facilities - just teaching rooms, staff and a library) at a former polytechnic, or hard science/engineering (with teaching labs, support staff, clean rooms, boats, computational clusters, etc depending on the course), it all tends to cost about the same, despite the courses incurring very different running costs!

No idea if they have more latitude with their international student fees.

On the other hand we are dealing with a very simple yes/no vote for strike action involving relatively few people, of which all have actively joined and are funding the union and it's activities.

If they can't be arsed to turn up and vote then why even be in the Union in the first place? If the Unions are against this then perhaps they should have more confidence in their union members and their ability to organise them into voting. If anything this will put more faith in the union strike process, knowing that at least 50% of all members approved the strike.

Generally it would seem to me that the ECHR has been very effective and good at highlighting areas where improvements are needed. I don't think it can be reduced down to EU judges meddling in our affairs, in fact they usually just point out where there are gaps in logic and law which are then subsequently filled to the benefit of all not just the one person fighting it at the court. If this truly is the case then what's the point of wasting time re-writing a bill of rights when we don't even have a written constitution.
The things that I think are are very important:


*1. the fundamental rulings prohibiting torture were actually enshrined in UK law in 1972 following the torture of suspected Irish paramilitaries in 1971. These same tactics of torture were used in 2003 in Iraq and it was the ECHR that ruled that prisons operated by the UK have to abide by the same domestic laws which includes the same prohibition on torture.


*2. One point of contention is the extradition of criminals. The key case of Abu Qatada was not that he would be subjected to inhumane torture (diplomatic assurances in Jordan were deemed sufficient evidence he would not be) but that the trial he would undergo in Jordan would utilise evidence from torture meaning that in that country he could never receive a fair trial. This led to a treaty with Jordan indicating that fair trials would be implemented and then he was deported. He has since been released by the Jordanian authorities.


*3. In 2010, the UK introduced legislation which criminalised forced labour and slavery. This was in direct response to the fact in France a girl from Togo was enslaved by her employees, escaped and then found that there was no law specifically prohibiting slavery or servitude. This was taken to the ECHR and her rights to freedom were upheld. The UK legislature took note of the French ruling and since have implemented new laws protecting those in forced servitude or slavery. There have since been a number of UK convictions


*4. The ban on corporal punishment. This was in response to a 9 year old boy being repeatedly caned with considerable force by his father in 1998. His father was tried for assault and actual bodily harm however the charge was dropped due to a clause in domestic law allowing 'reasonable chastisement' that was written in the Victorian era. This has since been changed to 'reasonable punishment'.


*5. A woman facing persistent harassment from an ex-partner and a child who was sexually abused took their cases to the ECHR and it was found the government lacked protections for people and children subject to continual harassment. Since this time the UK law has been amended to reflect these rulings.


*6.Surveillance. There are a lot of very important and very scary rulings that the ECHR has made to protect the UK public's right to individual liberties such as the recording of DNA evidence for anyone arrested for an offence (not convicted). The UK government was found to have the fingerprints and DNA profiles of 1 million people who had never been charged with or convicted of a crime. Since the challenge this data is kept but only for 6 years! There were also a number of rulings on illegal phone tapping which were largely ignored until the phone hacking scandal.


*7. Immigration- The protection of commonwealth citizens exercising their right to live and work in the UK with particular reference to east-african asians who were kicked out of their own countries following 'Africanisation’ of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. The rights of female immigrants to bring their children and spouses to the UK on the same terms that male immigrants were. This led to men having their rights to this reduced not vice versa.


There are also a multitude on protection of journalist sources, freedom of the press (to report on thalidomide), LGBT rights, the rights of people who lack mental capacity.

The UK may look tiny to you but this is going to be a nightmare logistically and drain you physically.

The only way to do this would be by car. You will spend a lot of time driving overnight. Its potentially dangerous if you are jetlagged, don't know the local driving rules and are driving on the wrong side of the road.

It would be madness by train. Leaving from London very early every day, spending 2-3 hours on a train, a few hours in a city then doing the return. Plus very expensive.

Forget sightseeing in London. I think after such an exhausting itinerary it would be hard to make a good choice too.

Id suggest doing some serious research on each university and culling your list down to about 6, then maybe visit one every other day. TheStudentRoom has subforums for each university/city, look at the rankings and read the prospectus for the courses.

null,false,lucasfuturecptn,null,null,null,"He appears to be another of those young, talented Germans who can use both feet, are fast and score goals.  He's been injured most of this season though but played in the World Cup.

From his Wikipedia page:

&gt;Draxler is both footed and known for his speed and intensity in a one-on-one situations. He is mainly deployed as a left winger but he can also be deployed as a right winger and as an attacking midfielder. In his Schalke youth career, Draxler was deployed mainly as an attacking midfielder where he always felt most at home. In addition, Draxler is known for possessing a powerful and impressive shot.

&gt;In January 2014, he was [named by The Observer as one of the ten most promising young players in Europe](http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/19/next-10-big-things-europes-top-youngsters).

It also says Arsenal and Chelsea have been sniffing around but his injuries, their depth and the fact that Schalke aren't in the Champions League mean we're not a step down for him.

&gt;FIFA's official website describes Draxler as ""tall, fast, with a keen eye for goal, and an exceptional talent in one-on-one situations from his regular position as a left-sided attacking midfielder"".

Bundesliga.com says [Draxler has sent records tumbling since making his Bundesliga debut for FC Schalke 04 on 15 January 2011](http://www.bundesliga.com/en/liga/news/2013/0000225820.php).

He'd cost around the £40m mark if reports are to be believed but he could instantly take us to the next level like Torres and Suarez did if he pays off.  I literally can't find of anybody else like that out there who wouldn't see us as a step down.

I agree a deep lying playmaker is what makes the best sides tick.

1) A team where the new players (Can, Moreno, Lovren, Markovic etc.) will have had a full year to bed in. Any new manager would have a pretty good idea on their strengths/weaknesses based on this past season (vs. Rodgers, who had to figure a lot of that out on the job). 

2) Leeway/not being second-guessed by the owners. Possibly more say on transfers than Rodgers got if he's a big name.

3) Not having to worry about where to shoehorn Stevie in on a sentimental farewell tour

4) The unquantifiable 'new manager' feelgood bump.

I'd say the above may flatter a new manager's results next season somewhat, which is unfortunate for Rodgers. However, being where we are and given how the year ended, I think Rodgers will have to make way for FSG to take the team forward. I'd be very surprised if FSG let him stay the course, but I do believe he'd start the year better given the above factors (apart from no. 4).",null,0,null,1432739178,null,0,false,0,crmje7u,null,t3_37gg3e,null,t1_crmje7u,null,t3_37gg3e,null,null,null,1433295256,null,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6,null

It was given £33,666 for a six month period by the Mayor's office, and as of 31 March this year the funding has stopped. It has since [launched a petition on Change.org](https://www.change.org/p/mayor-of-london-mayor-of-london-please-recognise-and-support-male-victims-of-rape-and-sexual-abuse?recruiter=77620958&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=share_email_responsive) to re-instate its funding...

&gt;“The Mayor welcomes additional funding from the Ministry of Justice for a number of organisations working with victims in London, including Survivors UK.”

&gt;But Michael May at Survivors UK told The Independent that since learning that the funding would not be renewed, the charity has constantly been in contact with the Mayor's office and has ""heard nothing,"" adding that there has been ""no indication"" that its £70,000 per year will be reinstated.

As I said in your previous post, I would STRONGLY recommend renting a car to get around.

Public transport (especially trains) can get extremely expensive during peak times. You said you have 4 people in your group. Imagine the cost of 4 x tickets and then the pain of lugging all that luggage through the stations and onto buses / taxis. You will stress yourself and your family out.

Do your sightseeing in London first (plus the visit to Kingston Uni) then hire a car and plan your route to each Uni following as many major roads as you can. That way you can streamline the visits. I think you will struggle to fit more than 2 Uni visits in per day, 1 in the morning and 1 after lunch. You guys will be exhausted and not in any mood for tours if you try to do more.

If I had to plan this trip, the schedule on most days would be:

&gt;With no money, no power and no prospects, Farron and co should pack up and join other parties to fight for liberalism

&gt;In the days before the 2010 election, anticipating a hung parliament, the Liberal Democrats were said to have spent days in front of a whiteboard drawing decision trees and engaging in scenario planning. They were, apparently, using techniques perfected by the CIA.
With the experienced economists Vince Cable and Chris Huhne in their senior team, they were well equipped to use advanced mathematical theories about the conduct of auctions to help them extract the maximum price from their potential negotiating partners.
Perhaps, however, they ran out of space on the board or missed out some brackets in one of the equations. If the CIA did use the same methods, it was to plan the Bay of Pigs fiasco. To put it politely, the payoff in the decision square that the Liberal Democrats ended up on was not as great as they might have hoped.
I think I know why. Game theory of the sort that won the late great John Nash (who died this week in a taxi accident) his Nobel prize is based on the idea that you can’t develop a strategy without thinking how other people will respond. If you make a move, others will react and their reaction will determine your next move. The game keeps changing, forcing you to change with it.
The Liberal Democrats made the first few moves. And those moves changed everything. They became a party of government and not a party of protest, and a part of the centre right, not a party of the centre left. Yet they just continued as if nothing had altered.
In the autumn of 2011 I described my astonishment at the way they were carrying on as if nothing had changed, writing that “the Liberal Democrats resemble that animated representation of mindlessness — Wile E Coyote in the Road Runner cartoons. There he goes, running off a cliff, carrying on without noticing that there is nothing beneath him. In the audience, we all know what happens next.”
Well it’s happened now. They have hit the ground. So now, what next? Nothing, that’s what. It’s over. It is so over that “what next” isn’t even the right question. The Liberal Democrats are about to chose a leader, asking themselves “who?” and “how?” and “when?”. But what they should really do is get Vince to take out his whiteboard again and in big letters write: “WHY?”
It is not impossible to imagine the Lib Dems surviving as a tiny parliamentary force, perhaps (very perhaps) winning by-elections, even finding a suitor in a hung parliament. What is less easy to see is why the effort to do this would be worthwhile.
Before I carry on, I want to say that while I believe that what I am saying is simply realistic, I am aware that to people who have put their lives into the Liberal Democrats it may appear not only very hard advice to take, but also disrespectful.
There are very many fine people in the Liberal Democrats, the party’s history is a distinguished one, it achieved a good deal in office and, most important of all, there is a corpus of liberal ideas that need to be defended and advanced.
The question these fine people need to ask themselves is whether maintaining a separate party organisation is any longer the best way of promoting liberalism.
There is nothing sacred about the existence of a political party. Plenty in British political history have come and gone. The Whigs, the Derby Dilly, the Peelites, the Liberal Unionists, National Labour, the New Party, the SDP. Each of these commanded the loyalty and energy of their supporters. This did not mean that they either could continue to exist as independent parties or needed to do so.
There is also nothing sacred about remaining in a single party. The longest-serving leader of the Conservative party, the Earl of Derby, had served in a Whig cabinet and promoted the Great Reform Bill. Tim Farron has described leading the Lib Dems as “curating the party of Gladstone” (an interesting way of putting it), yet William Gladstone had been a Conservative minister who spent a decade trying to repair his breach with that party.
Winston Churchill was both Liberal home secretary and Conservative prime minister. Austen and Neville Chamberlain were leaders of the Conservatives having been Liberal Unionists. And of course Liberal Democrats do not need to be reminded about Roy Jenkins.
Each of these people concluded that their previous party affiliation no longer served the ideas they were trying to promote and, let’s not be squeamish, no longer supported their ambitions either.
Now take a cold look at the Liberal Democrats. The party has hardly any seats. The boundary review endangers at least half the seats it does hold. It is a long way back in almost every seat it might hope to challenge for. It has no money. Its council base is much diminished. As happens to all parties after an election, it has acquired a few new members, huddling together for warmth. This, however, will not last.
If, by an extraordinary feat of endurance coupled with good fortune, it managed to acquire political leverage in a future hung parliament, how would it use it?
I don’t think sustaining another Conservative government would recommend itself to Lib Dem activists as an attractive option. Yet if the party can only work with Labour what is the advantage of remaining separate from it?
So what, exactly, does the party offer a person of liberal disposition seeking to promote their ideas? Not power, not financial resources, not a large activist base. Not much.
There remains one possible answer. The party offers other Liberals. It is a repository of ideas, the only place where Liberals can really be liberal. Yet even this crumbles upon closer investigation.
Take Nick Clegg and Tim Farron. Are they really so close in view to each other that they must stick together at the expense of being isolated from everyone else? If Nick Clegg was a Conservative or Tim Farron Labour, they would doubtless disagree with their new colleagues and try to persuade them to be more liberal. Yet would those differences be any greater than the differences they have with each other? To ask this question is to answer it.
In no respect — organisationally or philosophically — is having a separate Lib Dem party helping anyone. And nobody has a responsibility to “curate” the party of some long dead historical figure. It was fun while it lasted, but now it is game over.",null,0,null,1432740588,null,0,false,0,crmk8gk,null,t3_37fnbl,null,t1_crmk8gk,null,t1_crmajho,null,null,null,1433295652,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

He'd be a better player overall than Drogba though (not as good in the air but better elsewhere) and Chelsea would offer more supply than United.

I would still prefer someone else but I'm not sure how many options for a good second-choice striker there is out there. It's also important to consider that if players like Solanke, Brown, Bamford or other strikers are ever to get a chance, the team really can't be looking to buy a great young striker who would take their minutes. Someone like Falcao on a season-long loan might be good if there's no other options available as it allows Mourinho to delay making a proper choice for a while as Eto'o did last season.

I have no idea if it will work out for them or not nor do I even know if what they are doing is remotely a good idea, but I guess my point is sometimes it's okay to simply try something different.  We tried something different with BR- a manager with only 4 years of 1st team management experience and only 1 year at the top flight.  It hasn't worked out (in my estimation) and I personally don't think it ever will regardless of how much time he gets, but I had no problem whatsoever with the club giving it a go for a few years- it was worth a chance, just like buying Coutinho was worth a chance.

LRP I found didn't clean as good as I hoped. I just found out, though, that it has similar ingredients to Garnier, plus fragrance. Guess L'Oreal stick to true and tested micellar formula for all its brands.

I like Garnier the best. It feels gentle as it leaves my face feeling supple and hydrated after cleansing. I find the cleansing power to be as good as Bioderma. Most times, I find one cotton pad (using both sides) is enough to take off mascara and wipe off my makeup.

I use this mainly to take off mascara before oil cleansing, so this is the 1st step to my PM cleansing routine, since I hate having black streaks all over my face and washcloths. I use it all over my face to wipe off makeup just because. :p

The money and resources spent doing so might have had a greater impact if they had been spent in a different way.  That doesn't mean I don't want cyclists to be educated but your intention is not to educate them for the sake of educating them, it's a means to an end: reducing the damage they cause to themselves and others.  What if there was another, more effective way to reduce that damage?

Now, I don't know if it is more effective, but it's something to consider anyway:  What if educating motorists on how to be safer driving around cyclists made cyclists feel safer on the roads, and as a result less cyclists felt the need to cycle on pavements?  It'd certainly be easier to educate new drivers than new cyclists.  They have to pass a test before getting on the road and many take lessons from professional instructors.

I'm sick of the demonisation of muslims that has become commonplace in this country  (although they're not the only group being demonised) and I'm sure this story will be used by the ignorant to further their hatred of muslims, but I have to say it's a pretty good argument for not being allowed to wear them into shops, nobody would be expected to go into shops with helmets on, at Halloween there are often signs on the door asking people to remove their costume so their face can be seen. Just to clarify this is talking about a full-face covered Burka where you can't even see their eyes, not things like Hijabs. 

If I owned a shop and put a sign on my door that said nobody could come in with their face covered, that should be a universal rule that also applies to religions, but I imagine telling a muslim they couldn't come in while wearing a burka would not go down well. 

But then part of me wants to say people shouldn't be forced to show their face in shops anyway, I'm not sure I like this attitude that everyone is a potential thief so must show their face to camera.

I grew up being a Gerrard fan, I was ready to follow him, I remember crying to sleep with happiness when we won in Istanbul, I remember crying to sleep with sadness when we lost 2 years later in Athens.

When I found out he was leaving this year, I made it my duty to go and see him play. Money was rough as a kid and as much as my parents tried, I could never go - however I saved up and went to see him at Anfield vs Chelsea in the cup, no long was I standing outside Anfield without a ticket, no long was I on a bus to Anfield with my Liverpool shirt, being involved in the atmosphere but ultimately not being able to go inside. I was there, I saw my hero.

I then managed to get tickets to the Charity match, I actually paid for my parents to go too.

What the article is referring to is those key ideological and 'big issue' policies that can shape an entire campaign not just for the next election cycle, but for decades. In that sense liberalism has been successful in propogating itself throughout both main parties. Neoliberalism and social liberalism are both broadly accepted by both mainstream Labour and the Conservatives (however reluctantly, the broad brush of social liberalism is still there). 

With both social and economic liberalism being co-opted by both main parties it leaves a question of what the LibDems can really do to distinguish themselves. They need something beyond civil liberties or they'll always be a protest party. It's a problem in 2015 for the LibDems as it was a problem in 1918 for the Liberal Party - victims of their own success.

The difference here is that instead of a bank, the Department of Justice has found something else with an incredibly big warchest: FIFA.  

There was a reporter at the Brooklyn press conference who asked a pointed question towards the end of the Q&amp;A session about whether any of the ~$150 million forfeited by 4 defendants who already plead guilty (not counting the 9 indicted today) or any future funds would go back into the soccer community.  Acting EDNY US Attorney Kelly Currie said that the money was being set aside to go to ""the victims of the corruption.""  The reporter followed up by asking who are these victims.  Currie responded that the victim was global soccer.  

If you take a look back at the billions that has been forfeited by the aforementioned banks just in the last few years, the vast majority stays with DOJ.  We could get into a conversation about the merits of criminal and civil asset forfeiture but this isn't the subreddit for that sort of thing.  I will note, however, that in the case of HSBC, who laundered money to terrorist organizations, no one has yet gone to jail or even stood trial.  HSBC's deferred prosecution agreement with DOJ ends (and all charges will be dropped) in 2017.  

My prediction (and I hope I'm wrong): The Department of Justice uses these first dozen or so indictments to get evidence on the big fish.  They then strike a highly lucrative settlement and Deferred Prosecution Agreement with FIFA and the highest officials that they can get.  Very little changes in FIFA and 2026 world cup is held in north korea. I kid, but I'm not getting my hopes up about any real institutional changes.

I see a lot of IT CVs for my company, and here's my perspective:

To qualify you for the interview, you must clearly communicate:
 
 - last 2-4 years of work history
 - summary of skills

Longer CVs are not going in the bin, but likely won't get read in detail.

HOWEVER, demonstrating extensive experience gets you an interview for higher grades. So it's important to list your career history, even if it goes over two pages. Just try to summarize the crap out of it - a few lines mentioning responsibilities and particularly interesting projects. This establishes a track record and gives the interviewer something to ask about.

And don't lie about your skills - you'll very likely get found out at interview, and it erodes confidence in anything else you might have said or written. Down-playing experience in a little-used tech means that you're less likely to inadvertently talk yourself out of an offer.

There is *nothing* wrong with teaching cautious and responsible behaviour on the part of pedestrians, motorists and cyclists (and any other road or pavement user) with regards to others around them and yes - that includes cyclists too, despite fatalities.

I've not seen any proof, which makes that speculation. We could just as easily speculate that a movement of funds from male abuse support to female abuse support would be logical given the apparently larger figure of female abuse victims. That doesn't mean the male support is any less needed or useful? It's all about balance. 

Furthermore where education like this is concerned - isn't it simpler to amalgamate the teaching into something genuinely useful no matter what mode of transportation you favour? This could be done at a young age - prior to GCSE's even - and would teach entire coming generations how to respect each other and their surroundings. It needn't be the most costly program in the world and it needn't hugely detract from other teaching concerns... consider religious education. Some schools teach young people about Christianity, Islam, Judaism and so on *without favouring any single one of them*. Why not do the same with cycling, motoring, pedestrians etc? - it seems so easy. It doesn't have to be 'one or the other'. 

&gt; but it's something to consider anyway: What if educating motorists on how to be safer driving around cyclists made cyclists feel safer on the roads, and as a result less cyclists felt the need to cycle on pavements? 

Again this is speculation and I'd like to think you're right - but if we can see there are bad motorists - road rage types - then logically this goes for cyclists and pedestrians too. Some cyclists might just not care that pedestrians use the pavement (I've seen that first hand, unfortunately) just as some motorists might not care about cyclists. 

So we can focus on educating motorists but ultimately if we still have cyclists taking to pavements / pedestrian areas / behaving dangerously then we only deal with one facet of a larger issue of poorly educated people. 

&gt; You might get more responses if you don't ask such a loaded question.

I'm not sure how it's loaded - when I'm continually advocating tuition for *all* groups. 

If you found me saying 'effing cyclists need to be in school, they're a menace, dangerous on the roads and on the pavements! they should be locked up!' then yes that's biased and not how things should be. But I'm not. Teach the motorists by all means - there's evidence they need it. But each others too - there's evidence *they* need it.

I thought RIPA dated back to 2000, in its complete form? So yeah. I don't think this is about politics. I think this is about control. 

Not saying The Cameron is a god or anything - trying to point out that it makes no difference who is in power: they all seem to try the same crap. 

What bothers me the most out of all of this is, -- well, actually there are a few things. Let me try to be precise, even though the abject paranoia is trying to tinge everything right now: 

* No matter who gets voted into power, the buzzwords always seem to be the same - ""We need more/better/stronger capabilities to monitor/log/record everything"". 

The fact that with all the technology in the known universe, authorities still don't seem to be able to [get it right](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-30793163) over the most simplest of matters suggests that instead of getting more, they should just be working with what they already have as it is apparently too much for them to handle, already. 

* Having already known they are pissing off the majority of the country with their repeated attempts to enforce ISP-level controls, having consulted repeatedly on the possibility of further enforcing web restrictions, this is now all finally starting to feel like the prelude to government-enforced net neutrality with the transparent excuse of security to enforce it. 

In effect, rather than even attempting to turn the major, wide-spread censorship of access to the Internet in the UK into a security exercise, it seems to have, instead, turned into a [corporate exercise](https://wiki.openrightsgroup.org/wiki/Content_filtering_by_UK_ISPs), suggesting further government/corporate partnerships in attempting to bolt down what they think you should be allowed to see. A telling quote from the above link: 

&gt; The published[8] code of practice **did not mandate specific technical measures, but that an ""Active Choice"" be made regarding any filter tools.** They also commit to making filter controls free-of-charge (i.e. not directly paid for by the users of the controls).
The code should be in place before October 2012, and a report on its effectiveness as well as an assessment of future technologies is due from each ISP in October 2012.
A side-effect of ISPs offering free parental control solutions is that the UK market for such software will basically be decided by the choices of ISPs. Of the five main ISPs, three offer McAfee as their parental control software.

What else is being farmed out to corporations? You know, those organizations generally famed for their fantastic attention to oversight.... 

* This all sums itself up in my mind in the form of the question, ""Why are the people least qualified to decide, making the law on seriously technical issues?"" 

I don't understand why anyone without a PhD in a subject would even think themselves capable of passing a law on that subject? I literally feel like an alien when raising this point with people who don't seem to have any satisfactory answers for me, either. 

I feel bad even creating this post because my knowledge of this field (internet security/privacy legislation, etc.) isn't as huge as that of some of you on these boards but I feel strongly enough about it to do even the little research I have done. There's no way you could persuade me to start legislation of this subject - I would always ask for experts to be brought in - [LINX](https://www.linx.net/good/index.html) have always struck me as a good candidate for this role, for instance - yet, when the government consulted them on these very issues, they were outright ignored!

**TL;DR**: Ultimately, the goals of the people instigating these laws are not the goals of the people who will be at the mercy of them. It feels like another step closer to total government control and censorship of the Internet, and, in turn, further corporate shilling which can only lead to a subsequently corporate-dominated internet and the end of these halcyon days we are currently enjoying. Am I being too paranoid?

The CBT is not a test it is Compulsory Basic Training. You didn't fail anything.

The CBT can be very stressful, particularly if you don't have much road experience and since you're 16 - I'd wager that you don't have much. So because it's stressful, you'll likely get tired, brain overload will start and you'll stop taking in new information and stuff you know how to do will start to fall apart. Relax, use chicken wings. 

Go back and do a 2nd CBT, I'd advise against using the same place, try and find someone near from a recommendation. The 2nd time round you'll know what to expect and it'll be a lot easier and of course now you know what a one way street sign looks like :)

null,false,fdsafdaw3f3acvsda,cnty-scotland,Aberdeen,null,"&gt;We could just as easily speculate that a movement of funds from male abuse support to female abuse support would be logical given the apparently larger figure of female abuse victims. That doesn't mean the male support is any less needed or useful? It's all about balance.

That comparison doesn't really work.  I put forward something to consider that might be more effective at achieving the same thing: ""reducing the damage they cause to themselves and others"".  The aim of male abuse support is to support abused males, so shifting funds to female abuse support would not be more effective at supporting abused males.

&gt;Furthermore where education like this is concerned - isn't it simpler to amalgamate the teaching into something genuinely useful no matter what mode of transportation you favour? This could be done at a young age - prior to GCSE's even - and would teach entire coming generations how to respect each other and their surroundings. It needn't be the most costly program in the world and it needn't hugely detract from other teaching concerns... consider religious education. Some schools teach young people about Christianity, Islam, Judaism and so on without favouring any single one of them. Why not do the same with cycling, motoring, pedestrians etc? - it seems so easy. It doesn't have to be 'one or the other'.

&gt;Again this is speculation and I'd like to think you're right - but if we can see there are bad motorists - road rage types - then logically this goes for cyclists and pedestrians too. Some cyclists might just not care that pedestrians use the pavement (I've seen that first hand, unfortunately) just as some motorists might not care about cyclists.

&gt;So we can focus on educating motorists but ultimately if we still have cyclists taking to pavements / pedestrian areas / behaving dangerously then we only deal with one facet of a larger issue of poorly educated people.

I'd love to see that kind of education in schools.  Again, I'm not against educating people.  It doesn't have to be 'one or the other' but when it comes to things that cost money and resources, it often is.  If the government were to budget £x to lessening the risk posed by cyclists, at some stage someone will be considering the most effective way to do that with the funds allocated (or if someone approaches the government with a proposal on how to achieve X, being able to show that alternative approaches are less cost effective is a good way to support their own proposal, either way, the consideration is being made at some stage).  It might be educating people at a school level, it might be reworking driving tests to be more concious of cyclists.  Maybe someone can convince the government to do both, as well as significantly improving cycling infrastructure, and in a decade we'll join the our Dutch and Danish friends in cycling heaven.

&gt;I'm not sure how it's loaded - when I'm continually advocating tuition for all groups.

""Where is the harm in doing this and why are you against people being educated?"" is a loaded question because the presumption that someone suggesting or favouring an alternative is ""against people being educated"" is part of the question.

&gt;If you found me saying 'effing cyclists need to be in school, they're a menace, dangerous on the roads and on the pavements! they should be locked up!' then yes that's biased and not how things should be. But I'm not. Teach the motorists by all means - there's evidence they need it. But each others too - there's evidence they need it.

Repeating myself here but I just want to cover everything.   Anything that costs money involves considering most effective approach.  I'm not presenting any evidence, I'm just suggesting it's something to consider before you suggest anyone's ""against people being educated"".  That was really my main gripe with your comment, I'm not sure if what I'm suggesting is more effective, I was just providing an example of how someone could answer your first question without being against people being educated.",null,0,null,1432749077,null,0,1432750586,0,crmpitl,null,t3_37fjim,null,t1_crmpitl,null,t1_crmn97w,null,null,null,1433298144,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Stature? I'm sorry to say it, but our stature is exactly the same as Spurs currently. Players are equally as likely to want to play for both perennial Europa League teams. 

The teams are about as good as each other. Their keeper is better, their defence is equally as bad as ours (we conceded 48PL goals, they conceded 53), the midfields are pretty equal at this stage and they've got a 30 goal-a-season striker and we don't. They ended with a +5GD, we ended with a +4. I don't count Sturridge as a player any more. Until he's back and plays six months of first team football without injury, he's of little use to the team.

You can choose whatever company you want to buy goods from, what they do with their profits is essentially up to them. 

If I'm in a Union, I want that union to represent me, I want it to stand up for the rights I should have and get better pay.  Essentially Unions stand for the common goals of the people they represent.  But Politically they don't, many people will vote different ways.


Replace politics with religion.  I wouldn't want to belong to a union who took my money and supported one religion, that doesn't represent my views, especially as I'm directly supporting that religion when it may be polar opposite of my views.

As has already been said, university courses in the UK are different to  courses in the USA. We choose a specialism (or two) immediately, rather than in the last year or two. 'Liberal Arts' degrees and the like really don't happen much here. Has your daughter put much thought into what subject/area she wants to study to degree level? Some institutions have better reputations than others for specific courses, and not all universities offer everything.

The Guardian newspaper has just published its [university league tables](http://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2015/may/25/university-league-tables-2016) for 2015.

I would suggest you take a look at the overall scores for each institution, and then look at any specific area your daughter wants to specialise in. Some 'low' scoring universities, score highly in specific or niche courses, or where there is a special research interest.

The ""Moneyball"" approach is not ""buying cheaply and building success via statistical analysis of players’ achievements on the field"" as has been described by the Liverpool Echo and other countless journalists. 

The ""Moneyball"" concept is simple - MLB teams were undervaluing on base percentage in their batters, and the ability to not swing at bad pitches for years. These players were vastly underpaid in comparison to their colleagues and their relative price was much lower than their counterparts. 

Moneyball is simply trying to exploit market inefficiencies to your advantage.  It would be akin to every team not wanting to buy big and strong strikers in the Premier League, instead opting for shorter, faster players. In applying this to football, the Moneyball concept would be akin to buying big, strong strikers at a cheaper, discounted rate instead of paying ""market value"" for smaller forwards. 

It's NOT to buy young. It's NOT based off of analytics. FSG are not applying the Moneyball concept - they're simply using analytics and choosing to buy young for resale value purposes.

Gaelic isn't a native culture. It's very old. But everyone in Ireland is an immigrant.

Not to mention Normans, Romans (?), Vikings, Danes, and others turned up on Ireland at various times and also the Kingdom of Dal Riata covered bits of what is now Northern Ireland and Scotland and a shit tonne of Irish people flooded across to Britain in the ""Great Conspiracy"" where loads of different nationalities took on the Romans in the 300s.

So you end up getting stuck behind lorries doing 50. Then it feels a lot of effort doing that speed, because 125s don't like going fast. And since motorways are boring and all fast, it's trying to hold the bike at that constant speed. For hours and hours and why aren't we nearly there yet?

null,false,BranDonCorleone,null,null,null,"I think just the opposite.  You raise an interesting point with the DoJ's targeting of large banks.  True, they also have huge amounts of reserves, but their charges were substantially different.  They were largely accused of behaving recklessly when it came to speculating, buying and selling securities, and creating too much risk in the market.  These are completely different charges as they all involve intentional conduct, from what I can tell (haven't read the indictment yet, but will when I get home from work).  Second, banks are all corporations, which means that their internal structure shields individuals from liability under the law.  FIFA is not a corporation and it has not been indicted as a specific entity.  Instead, these are individual corruption charges that carry far more weight than any typical white collar crime, which usually reduces to a large fine with minimal jail time in federal court.  The reason bank cases settle most of the time boils down to the strength of the case.  Prosecutors feel comfortable putting a big dent in the bank's resources, even though not as high as a judge-rendered sentence, without risking the case on the whims of a jury when the case isn't knockdown.

On the subject of the case by itself, I think there's a high likelihood that the indictments result in some convictions, if not guilty pleas in exchange for a reduced sentence.  Loretta Lynch, the new US Att'y Gen., was previously a US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, which is the exact venue of this case.  Until assuming leadership of the entire DoJ, she was the lead prosecutor, meaning she has special interest in seeing the case carried through.  Moreover, the FBI director was present for the initial press conference, which shows that the agency is putting a lot of resources into it.  They have likely already executed extensive search warrants, including wire taps and electronic surveillance in order to attain discovery of documents material to the crimes.

As for the substantive law, the US is relying on a jurisdictional statute that gives federal districts the rights to sue international parties with very loose connections to the United States, in this case bank accounts.  The law was passed primarily to fight terrorism organizations, but it has application here.  I can guarantee you that there's no way the US would have issued an indictment if they didn't believe that they had jurisdiction.  Indictments in the federal system have resulted in extremely high conviction ratings, although these ratings are boosted considerably by federal drug convictions.  These charges in particular seem noteworthy because the DoJ is focusing on CONCACAF and CONMEBOL bribes.  CONCACAF has an office in Miami, Florida, and many of the officials connected have strong ties to the US, meaning evidence will be more attainable.  My actual suspicion is they have issued indictments to leverage information from the accused.  If they accept guilty pleas and reduced punishments, they could provide the testimony that exposes the roots of the entire criminal operation.  As for as civil and criminal forfeiture go, I don't really care.  I care more about the future distribution of funds and the changing of the organization.  If the rest of the international community were too scared or powerless to do anything about, then let the feds have the money.

Finally, as to whether that will result in systemic change within FIFA as an organization.  Immediately, I think no.  Chances are, Blatter will be re-elected on Friday.  The legitimate (i.e. uncorrupted) voters were likely to vote for his opponent, Prince Ali bin Hussein of Jordan, who was actually running as a UEFA-backed candidate because his own region would not support him (probably because they're corrupt through-and-through).  While his rhetoric has been consistently anti-corruption, he is an ""insider,"" currently the FIFA VP for Asia.  Some have suggested the recent arrests would sway many voters to change their stances.  Personally, I believe this to be unlikely because Blatter will still seem like a safer option for those who are now scared of prosecution, but you can assess the situation for yourself, as it's all speculation.  In the long term, there's potential for this to be the start of something big.  The prosecutorial heavyweights are now involved, but the real key will be for international whistleblowers and enforcement agencies to come out of the shadows.

TL;DR - The indictments definitely aren't a money hunt, and the charges are very serious.  Whether long term change will occur is unclear but the signs are there.

Depends on your familiarity with the classic series. Some are relatively approachable for someone who has vague awareness, some dive deep into the lore.

That said, the minimum requirements I'd recommend are:

* Spare Parts
* Storm Warning (for the introduction of Charlotte Pollard)
* The Marian Conspiracy (For the introduction to Evelyn Smythe)
* The Eye of the Scorpion (For the introduction of Erimem)
* The Harvest (For the introduction of Hex)
* The Chimes of Midnight (After Storm Warning)
* Project: Twilight (for the introduction of The Forge)
* Project: Lazarus (and other ""Project: ..."" titles - the Forge is a good arc)
* 45 (For various reasons, but nobody is introduced. That's important.)
* Flip-Flop
* ...ish
* Live 34
* Master
* Jubilee
* Colditz (Don't let the sound engineering fool you - it may sound like it was cheaply knocked together in someone's bathroom, but it's a cracking good story)
* The Holy Terror
* The One Doctor
* The Girl Who Never Was *and* The Condemned for an important transition

There are also several quite good stories in the Divergent Universe arc, but getting into them is a point of contention for some fans. To get adequate background on the Divergent Universe, you need to listen to Storm Warning and Chimes of Midnight, followed by Neverland, Zagreus, Scherzo, and The Creed of the Kromon - the first two of these being silly and convoluted, the third being downright surreal, and the fourth merely adequate for introducing a new (but central) character and culture.

Truth be told, I've listened to a ton of these, roughly in release order, and have only disliked one: Nekromanteia. It's bad. It rivals *Time Flight* as the worst Doctor Who story of all time. It's brutal, uncomfortable, and feels like the kind of dream you'd have when you've got a migraine.

**When?**

Individual Doctors' stories tend to progress in release order, and there isn't much bleed through from one Doctor's BF releases to another's.

The introductions listed above pretty much cover the bigger plot lynchpins, but there are some additional mini-arcs. A good rule of thumb is to look at [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_audio_plays_by_Big_Finish), and check for release order and ""Series Sorted."" Any time you see two or more immediately sequential releases which also have immediately sequential ""series sorted"" values, they are likely to directly connect to each other (For example, releases 117 through 119 have Series Sorted values of 6RA, 6RB, and 6RC - they form the Key 2 Time trilogy).

Lars Bender from Bayer Leverkusen. Young (26) German international Defensive midfielder with loads of first team experience. Is an excellent passer of the ball and has great movement going forward as well as back. Has played with Emre Can both at International level as well as club level. Current transfer value is listed at around 22m euros.

* Here is his highlight reel...

Leroy Sane from Schalke. 19 Year old German international. Fantastic attacker with loads of creativity, pace, and ability on the ball. Can also rip shots from distance. This kid is going to be a star and I'm pretty sure we will be able to get him for under 15m Euros.

Borini has a very similar scoring record for Swansea, Sunderland and more impressively Roma. Nobody wants to keep him but would be happy to swap him for a player who is eerily similar to him in a lot of respects. Ings is cheap, but Borini is free as we already have him.

&gt; Applications for Britain’s Hardest Grafter, which will be screened on BBC2, are limited to those currently earning less than £15,500 per year.

&gt; The BBC is seeking 25 British workers, a mix of the unemployed, the under-employed and those earning the minimum wage, who will be given the opportunity to “prove themselves” through a series of challenges. A cash prize is on offer for the winner.

&gt; A representative of the production company Twenty Twenty told the website Graduate Fog: “In each episode, people will be put to the test in a series of challenges and tasks.

&gt; “At the end of each episode, those who have produced the least will be eliminated and by the end of the process, just one worker will remain. The winner will receive in the region of £15,000 which is a year’s living wage (outside of London).”

null,false,NEWSBOT3,cnty-uk,Londontown,null,"I did some quick maths on this because i'm an IT geek and I've managed some fairly large IT systems in the past. Lets say this was a single facility (which it actually isnt in this proposal as they want to oblige ISPs to do this instead).

Western europe used 12.6PB/month of data in june 2014

Population in 2013 (couldnt get a 2014 figure) was ~424 million.

Pop of uk in 2013 (64.1 million)


Therefore UK uses ~ 1.9PB/month of internet traffic, possibly more.

That's just internet use, nevermind phone calls.

That has to be kept for 12 months, and backed up at least once, which means theyd require 48PB of storage, plus ongoing growth. Assume RAID 10 storage, so they'd need 4 drives min for that, plus redundancy, so say 6. That's ~ 300 PB of storage per year, and growing. 

it's certainly possible to buy storage systems in that size, but you are talking huge amounts of money - think 8-9 figure sums for the hardware and support every year alone and you'd be about right. The bandwidth costs for that amount of usage into a datacenter to storage it would be a similarly obscene number. And writing that much data to disks, even SSD's you'd be looking at close to 100GB/sec of data writes (you might get 1GB/sec from a good current gen SSD right now, but thats in perfect conditions). So you'd have to farm it out to several hundred different disk arrays to even keep up. I dont have a source for storage system pricing because vendors dont like to give it out. But i've seen 150TB systems with write speeds of 100MB/sec cost £500k to buy and about the same again to run, so do the math.


That is a FUCKTON of hardware. You are talking an entire world class datacenter just for this. If you need less than maybe 50 staff full time for it, i'd be surprised. It all needs monitoring, replacing when it breaks, securing (so you also need security staff and systems), backing up and recovering to a standard useable in a court of law. The bureacracy surrounding it along would be huge.  And you'd be talking ~ 100k/person in wage , pension, NI and other costs for he speciality knowledge and experience you'd need, as an *average*

A conservative estimate for this I reckon you'd be talking £200 million a year to even run it, possibly even more. And that's not including electricity, cooling, building facilities, bandwidth costs and so on. Hell you'd probably have to build a power station for it just to keep up with the power drain it'd use. Estimate all that, you are probably talking £600-750 million a year, in my opinion. The startup equipment costs would be probably close to a billion alone.


Thats without even considering the photo and sms data they also want to keep.

If nothing else, nevermind the huge privacy issues, the sheer cost of what they want to do is utterly insane.

a) Nope - SU. The SU is a separate entity and self-governed by students. b) I was referring to the posts linked above, which were on her personal Facebook account.

But given those two caveats: She did say ""white trash"" on the SU twitter account, which is really unprofessional. Shouldn't have done it. Perfectly reasonable to calmly say that. Instead, [people are hurling disgusting racist and sexist slurs at her.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/37gfbk/bahar_mustafa_goldsmiths_students_union_diversity/crmuf0g?context=3) News stories about her were upvoted in /r/Whiterights and /r/CoonTown. What I'm saying is that there's a point at which the backlash is completely absurd - that point was passed long, long ago.

&gt; Secondly, I would get sacked if I wrote 'kill the blacks' on my personal Facebook account, and this woman is a DIVERSITY OFFICER. Not being racist is literally her job.

a) Preeeetty sure she doesn't actually want to kill all white men. But okay, you're making a point about how acceptable it is to say that in jest, right?

b) Assuming you're white and of English heritage: Yes, yes you would be sacked, particularly given that black people are a minority in Britain, and the UK's history of violent colonialism and enslavement of black people for its own profit. On the other hand, the UK suffered no such oppression. Saying ""Kill the white people"" is nowhere near as bad because there's never been a black National Front, a black Oswald Mosley, a black racist skinhead movement, etc. It's obviously a joke because it's divorced from the realities of racism. You as a white Englishman saying ""kill the blacks"", on the other hand, would place you firmly in context of a long history of violent racism whose consequences BME people still face.

Now, there are nuances to this - saying ""kill the Irish"" would also be shit, because you know the whole Home Rule and Troubles thing is still quite fresh - but the basic dynamic is the same: Because wealthy white English men are historically the most structurally powerful class, arguing that jokes about eradicating them constitute a real threat of oppression and genocide is completely ignorant of history and its effect on society today.",null,0,null,1432759351,null,0,1432760169,0,crmw5lb,null,t3_37gfbk,null,t1_crmw5lb,null,t1_crmvntp,null,null,null,1433301341,null,-14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-14,null

However, rape is something formally defined, and it has the weight it does exactly because it is so narrowly defined and is punished under the law in the most severe manner. It is inherently and inextricably tied up with the idea of legal consequences. Certainly there can be legal debate about if the definition should be changed in future law reform on the basis of considerations of fairness, justice, equality, etc. But that's a far cry from saying that rape means whatever an individual wants it to mean, reflecting how they feel. 

This typically expands the concept to generally all kinds of sexual assault, which substantially weakens the meaning of the concept. We have different words associated with different legal offences for good reason: it allows us to make distinctions. By merging everything under the general umbrella of rape, you would undermine the utility of both the law and language.

As an aside, your attempt to bring emotion into the debate is not appreciated. What is just, right, true etc is not determined by emotional reactions or feelings, but by reason and evidence.

Let's say a family buys 4 properties over their life to build up to a house at that cost. A £400k house they would pay £10k in stamp duty, then a 750k house would pay £27.5k, a £1.4m is £83k. Then a £2m house would pay £153k in stamp duty.

That's over quarter of a million pounds in tax, and they wanted to take more each year!

And that's people who can really afford to buy £2m houses, let alone the people who are asset rich and just bought at the right place at the right time. You could have bought a house for £70k in the 80's and by no fault of your own but had a lucky investment been made to move out if you or have a backlog on your children's inheritance paid to the government when you die.

But then again.. If they're going to generate all the money from this tax on houses over £2m, why not lower the threashold to £1m... or £500k, which is still double the price of the UK average property (A ""mansion"" in a lot of peoples eyes.)

null,false,SausageManDan,null,null,null,"Why would a state fund a charity. Okay, look at it this way, I'll put my opinion across.

You were rudely awoke to someone, male or female taking advantage of yourself while you were unconscious. You spend 6 months trying to put your life back together after the incident to which finally you accept that no matter how physically and mentally strong you are, you still struggle to sleep at night, struggle to leave the house, or have flashbacks to that terrible incident to which you still feel so incredibly vulnerable.

You muster up that courage and you go to the doctors, to which the doctor sympathizes with you (that person earns figure A), and agrees to send you for help and prescribes you Drug Z. You get a call around 6-8 weeks later (if you're lucky) from the Adult Mental Health Service, AMHs for short. (Or CAMHs for under 18s). They book an appoint with you to meet with one of the team. The 6 weeks rolls by and you meet with another person to ""assess your needs"" (that person earns figure B). To which from that you could be told it is anything from 6 weeks to 18 months before you get the correct treatment like CBT or therapy with a councilor. Okay, so in that time you could meet with a psychiatrist (earns figure C), a psychologist (earns figure D), and a care coordinator (who earns figure E). Before *FINALLY*     you meet with the CBT team (earns figure F) and you actually start treatment. 

With that, you're now looking at around a year at least from the day you went to the doctor, to all the referrals to the AMHs team, and between all the people in AMHs who work ""together"" to write letters TO EACH OTHER saying what that person needs and how long that will take while also giving that person at least a months notice to the appointment. So from the day you start that ball rolling to finally getting the help you need starting you're looking at all those wages. Figure A, B, C, D, E and F. Combined we will call that figure *x*     .

Okay, so figure X is say, £250,000 when you consider a psychiatrist can easily be on £45,000+ a year. And that is NOT including all the personal assistants and receptionists dotted all over the place.

And now you've got the charity, the one in which from another comment states that when the funding was stopped about £36k was given to fund the charity for 6 months. So let's double that to £72,000 a year. 

Okay, that not only funds all manners of people that can help talk, listen and reach out to all those poor people who have experienced that, some of which have the exact same qualifications as people working for the NHS but they've retired or have spare time to give out of the generosity of their own hearts. The main difference in the service here is the government one is official and can prescribe you medication, the charity can't but they can give you a damn site fucking more appointments, see you more than once in a 2-3 month period despite what you care plan states as weekly. Or once a month, it will be a lot longer between appointments that it should and you're feeling no better as no one has had a conversation with you other than for an hour at a time and none of them can give any personalism as to why they WANT to help you (news flash, they don't, they enjoy what they do, but the don't particularly enjoy you as a person).

People that work for a charity will actually take time out of their day to call you to see how you are, to check in every few weeks if they haven't heard or seen you for a while.

Trust me, I know how fucking awful the government and the mental health services are. I've been in that system for 4 long fucking years. Both CAMHs and AMHs and you want to know the truth? I've been told I'll be getting CBT, I got told that over a year ago? They haven't mentioned it to be since. Just that i'm on a ""waiting list"".

And that, is why our government should still be funding charities. Drop the wages of some of those NHS staff down to a livable and comfortable wage. Not one where they're on £70k+. The average UK wage is like £26k a year. Millions of other people can afford to live on it. Well, there's your £36k that will fund that charity for a further 6 months.

null,false,MrSqueegee95,lfc68,,null,"This season in the league, Jovetic has played 788 minutes and Walcott has played 456 minutes. That means Jovetic has played 3.5 more games than Walcott. In those games he has scored the same amount of goals, as a striker compared to Walcott as a winger. So this season undoubtedly Walcott has the better goal record and I would say has performed better. Although Jovetic has assisted 3 to Walcott's 0, but having played nearly double the minutes you would expect that.

Last season Jovetic played 367 minutes and Walcott played 859 minutes. Jovetic scored 3 and Theo scored 5. So in that season Jovetic just nicks the best scoring record. But then Walcott had 4 assists to Jovetic's 1, so in that department he was better. So in that season I would say it is about even in performance.

In 2012/13 Walcott hammered Jovetic in terms of output and in this season they both played tons of games without injuries.

Jovetic played 2510 minutes to Walcott's 2285 minutes. In that season Jovetic scored 13 goals and assisted 5. Walcott scored 14 and assisted 10. So he performs better in both areas playing as a winger.

So in 3 seasons I would say Walcott has performed better than Jovetic, maybe last season it was arugable but I would still say Theo nicks it.

You're the one mixing two concepts: legal definitions and dictionary definitions (social). The Oxford dictionary states it as a crime typically committed by a man, not solely committed by men. Legal definitions change the world over, some include parts that ensure that only men can rape and others can't. But the dictionary definition doesn't change.

I'm not talking about changing the legal definition to include female rape (although I'd support that). What I'm talking about is the fact that everyone except pendants like yourself accept that rape just means sex without consent whether it's two men, two women, or any combination of perpetrator and victim.

But not giving you a new role because somehow else internally fairly got it instead, and then you leaving because this demotivated you, will almost certainly not constitute constructive dismissal.

In any case, any outrage over banning legal highs is, in my opinion, misdirected. Legal highs are legal because they're completely new and therefore untested, often totally fucking dangerous compared to the ""main"" drugs, and there would be no demand for them if the ""main"" drugs were accessible in a safe and regulated manner. 

So the ongoing prohibition on drugs results in the following damaging side-effects on society, and many many more:

- The supply chain is in the hands of criminals, underground, out of sight, unregulated, the drugs get cut with all 
manner of rat poison and horseshit, leading to deaths

- Drug money cannot be declared, deposited or taxed and therefore largely stays in the criminal economy

- Chemical manufacturers looking to beat the system ""above board"" rush ""legal highs"" to the market, or made up chemical compounds. Users of ""legal highs"" play russian roulette with their immediate life and long term physical and mental health.

What I'm trying to get at is that the supply and demand of legal highs is a poisonous symptom of the war on drugs in general, not a standalone topic in its own right. Anyone advocating use of these toxic ""legal highs"" might as well go down to B&amp;Q and start ingesting combinations of any chemicals they can find.

&gt;What do you then suggest we call it then when a woman rapes a man if we can't use the word rape to mean exactly what the dictionary defines it as?

This presupposes that women can rape men, which you therefore use to go on to prove that rape refers to women raping men.

The meaning of words in a social context is not determined by dictionaries, but by common use. Dictionaries are not authorities, they merely record use.

Regardless, there's no debate to be had about meanings of words in social contexts; that way lies pointless debates about British vs. American English, etc. Informal language is messy and disordered and illogical. People can say whatever they like, and if they manage to successfully communicate then good on them, they've achieved their goal. 

I'm honestly not sure what it is you're trying to argue for here.

A) If we're discussing the technical meaning of rape then see above for the legal discussion. The term varies by jurisdiction but has a firm definition in each.

B) If we're discussing the use of the word ""rape"" in general, there's no discussion to be had. There's no right or wrong, no definitive meaning, there's just the thousands of different ways its used, which includes the above technical definition, but also includes analogies, metaphors, etc. Facebook rape, for example. The question ""Is X rape?"" is meaningless if you're using the social definition, because the answer is invariably ""if that's how two or more people use the word and successfully communicate their meaning, yes"" But at the same time, another group of people could use the word in a different manner, and those people are also correct, because they've also successfully communicated within *their* group.

Vietto wil be courted by CL teams because he is a potentially great player. We will have to be competitive in the transfer market if we want to improve our squad instead of stagnating. He is gettable and he is just one example. There are many better options than Ings available.

Those who are UK resident and UK domiciled are taxed on the Arising basis. This means that your worldwide income and gains are subject to UK Income Tax (IT) and Capital Gains Tax (CGT).

If you are non-domiciled in the UK but are a UK resident in any given Tax Year, you can choose to be taxed on the Remittance basis rather than the Arising basis. This means that only income and gains accruing in the UK (rather than accruing worldwide) will be subject to UK Income Tax and CGT. The penalty for this favourable approach is that you won't get a Personal Allowance for Income Tax (£10,600) or an Annual Exemption for CGT (£11,100) so **all** your income and gains will be subject to tax.  Apart from this, there is no tax charge, as long as you haven't been resident for more than 6 of the last 9 Tax Years.

If, however, your foreign income and gains are under £2,000 you get the Remittance basis automatically without claim, and can keep your IT allowance and CGT exemption.

Assuming your foreign income/gains are more than the £2,000 *de minimis* limit, then once you are resident in the UK for 7 out of 9 Tax Years, an annual tax charge of £30,000 is payable. This increases to £60,000 for 12 out of 14 years and £90,000 for 17 out of 20 years. I believe the government has also made the Remittance basis tax charge apply for a minimum of three years, so that non-domiciled individuals are not easily able to arrange their tax affairs so as to only pay the charge occasionally. Therefore, you could face a charge of £90,000 x 3 years (£270,000 in total) if you claim the Remittance basis once you have been here for 17 out of 20 years. (**Edit:** It appears they are merely consulting on this change, and the measure is not yet in force.)

Once you have paid the tax charge, you can choose to remit to the UK up to £30,000 (or £60,000, or £90,000 as appropriate) foreign income and/or gains without suffering further UK IT or CGT on those monies. Any extra monies remitted to the UK would however be taxed at your normal IT and CGT rates. (**Edited** for simplification.)

To put this into context, my Polish car wash attendant is non-domiciled but resident. He has no foreign income or gains, so pays UK Income Tax as normal, as he gets the Remittance basis without claim, and without loss of allowance. Even if he was forced to pay IT on his worldwide income via the Arising basis, he only earns a salary in the UK, so there would be no difference between his tax bill and mine. (**Edit:** In how it is calculated, at least!)

However, Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea football club, (probably) earns several million pounds worth of Roubles in Russia, and (probably) has similar amounts of Russian capital gains. I am sure he would be quite happy to pay £90,000 p.a. and additional tax on whatever he earns solely in the UK to avoid HMRC applying UK IT and CGT to his **worldwide** income and gains. It's probably small change for him.

I hope this helps!

It says, and I almost leapt for joy when I saw it, that Aubamayeng is a target as back up to Benteke. Hopefully Villa price us out of a move because Aubamayeng is a much better fit, and has more potential in my opinion.

It says Milner's wages are likely to be £120k. It is high but he's English and on a free transfer which will hike it up a little.

Claims Ings compensation fee will be £4m, but the Independent said it would be £6m and Sky say another so I'm going to assume they're all guessing because it'll come down to a tribunal anyway. I remember Sturridge to Chelsea was supposed to be £3/4m and turned out to be £7.5m after add ons (£3.5m basic fee).

Definitely an important factor for him. Can't say for the rest, it may be speculation. Does seem they are covering all angles when combined with their 'taking a sabbatical' story.

&gt;If your landlord's licence is suspended or taken away, they will no longer be able to use the property as an HMO. This means you may have to move out. However, if the fixed period of your lease has not yet expired, your landlord cannot make you leave until it expires. So for example, if you have rented a room in an HMO for a year but your landlord's licence was revoked after two months, you would be able to stay for the remaining ten months, provided the property was safe for you to live in.

&gt;If the council decides that the property is not safe (for example, because it does not meet fire safety regulations), it will be responsible for helping you find somewhere else to live. 

http://scotland.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/advice_topics/renting_rights/houses_in_multiple_occupation_hmos

So, the Council may have to find you somewhere else to live, it could be worth contacting the local council and explaining what's happening cause what your landlord is doing is pretty illegal. 

If you're not sure about that you could call one of the advisor's at Shelter and see if they can offer advice. Also, since you signed nothing it means you have an Assured Tenancy which gives you a lot more rights in terms of being able to be kicked out, so legally your landlord can't make you leave short of an eviction order, which could be another reason she doesn't want you talking to the Council - they might explain your rights.

That has nothing to do with my point

&gt;News stories about her were upvoted in /r/Whiterights and /r/CoonTown.


STOP PRESS TWO IRRELEVANT RACIST SUBREDDITS AGREE WITH MY POINT IT MAKES IT INVALID

&gt;What I'm saying is that there's a point at which the backlash is completely absurd - that point was passed long, long ago.

It should have passed a long time ago, because she should be out of a job

&gt;a) Preeeetty sure she doesn't actually want to kill all white men.

That makes requesting genocide fine then

&gt;But okay, you're making a point about how acceptable it is to say that in jest, right?

You're correct for once!

&gt;b) Assuming you're white and of English heritage:

&gt;I'm from Norfolk of course I am

&gt;On the other hand, the UK suffered no such oppression.

I think some girls in Rotherham may disagree with you there

&gt;Saying ""Kill the white people"" is nowhere near as bad because there's never been a black National Front, a black Oswald Mosley, a black racist skinhead movement,

Apart from that whole Black Power thing

&gt;You as a white Englishman saying ""kill the blacks"", on the other hand, would place you firmly in context of a long history of violent racism whose consequences BME people still face.

But non-violent racism is fine

&gt;Now, there are nuances to this - saying ""kill the Irish"" would also be shit, because you know the whole Home Rule and Troubles thing is still quite fresh

Home Rule was 100 fucking years ago and the Troubles were in Northern Ireland

&gt;but the basic dynamic is the same: Because wealthy white English men are historically the most structurally powerful class, arguing that jokes about eradicating them constitute a real threat of oppression and genocide is completely ignorant of history and its effect on society today.

She didn't say that she wanted to get rid of 'wealthy white English men' (which is wrong on too many levels) but all white men, from America to Iran.

It is this vapid mentality which allowed Rotherham and the murder of Kriss Donald to happen. Martin Luther King would be rolling in his fucking grave.

Friends who have studied in America have said British university is more intense because you know what your subject is straight away. 

Also the fun stuff. Drinking culture is massive at English universities. Especially the ones you have listed so  most students will have been drinking for 2 or 3 years already. 

As well as this most British universities don't take attendance, and they generally don't care if you fail so it's on your own back to make sure you succeed. This can be a bit of a wake up call for a lot of people out of high school as it's such a big change. 

You will most likely be in the middle of a city so you have to take into account the differences between that and where you currently live. 

I'd recommend visiting the uk for a couple of weeks before you move there (if you haven't already) just to get used to your surroundings and perhaps pick up on any cultural differences you notice.

I had issues with timeouts and disconnects a few years ago. Turned out the issue was that a neighbour had opened up the cover on the box outside the front of my flat and put in a splitter to run a cable up to their flat. Normally, this wouldn't have been too much of an issue. But they didn't use proper connectors on all of the fittings and had simply twisted the wires together on the main cable. 

Engineer came round, took their splitter off, and everything was fine. According to the engineer this happens all the time. They also said that if the connection is put together by just twisting the wires, even without the splitter, this can still cause issues with disconnects.    

Apparently it's quite common for people to splice their own cable to get it through a wall, and fail to put a proper fitting back on it and just twist tie it instead to another piece.

b) go to the people who fixed the Turbo and ask them to look at it again. If they touched your car and the Turbo hasn't been fitted properly they need to make sure it's at least checked and sealed properly. TBH if the car is juddering at low speed and has an oil warning light then you have pressure issues and because the engine sounds like it's not getting enough air at low speed(revs). That could be caused by all of the above issues, except the sump. Regardless - if they fitted your turbo, they own the problem. The AA will probably say the same thing.

Trouble is by ""metadata"" they don't just mean stuff visible to the ISP, they mean metadata of any communication, even if that's embedded within some other service.  E.g.

The draft of the Communications Data Bill from two years ago would have given the government the power to change the list of services to intercept on a very short timescale.

It is by definition segregation. You are segregating people based on their skin colour, racial segregation. You just don't like the reality of it.

&gt;Well I am still waiting for you to have a better idea.

I told you, tell the police and university employees. If they are experiencing actual racism then something will be done about it. Locking themselves in the ""no whites"" room will only breed resentment and if they are experiencing racism, it will only continue when they come out of their ""no whites"" areas. 

What happens when white people experience racism? Do they have a ""safe space"" to go to? Or are they expected to deal with it because they are white and thus the exception?

I hope not!

&gt;Even though this information is stored it cannot just be accessed without the authority of seniors in the organisation which would have to be justified.

That's a moderately contentious point. Little is known about the degree of oversight which would be afforded (i.e. legislated for) on a per-body basis, but given the intention to provide data to multiple (entirely distinct) entities, and with the original intent to add to the bodies allowed access at any time, it looks like it will be a case more of internal procedure than external oversight.

&gt;That information is just the basic data, which IP spoke to which IP etc. etc.

That's not quite the case. Going on what we know of the Draft Communications Data Bill, intercepted data would include *at the very least* all websites visited, all email correspondents, all instant messaging/social media friends, as well as details pertaining to text messages, VOIP calls, etc.

In terms of sifting meta-content from content, this too is problematic:

*""While the content of messages is not supposed to be included, the 2009 LSE report on the last set of proposals notes that separating communications data and content is no longer straightforward.""*

Blanket, untargeted wire-tapping becomes a matter of trust. Do we trust that data will be sifted correctly? NSA operatives were found to have been spying on lovers, so what of the human aspect?

&gt;I personally do not see how the security services have the time, hardware or desire to start sifting through 60 million peoples worth of communications.

Who knows. [They can back-up the entire content as passed through tapped fibre-optic cables for 3 days, and the meta-content for 30](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-06/24/gchq-tempora-101). Guessing at hardware capabilities isn't especially productive and is not, I think, the point.

The point is this: why should blanket surveillance be the default? Why should the innocent sacrifice their human right to privacy given the proven inefficiency of systems which cost billions and provide precious little in return. The 'think of the children', 'stop the terrorists' line is fine, but it's just that: a line. With such vast quantities of data, we may have more needles, but the haystack is also unfathomably larger. There is no evidence to suggest that NSA and GCHQ's methods have been sufficiently effective as to warrant the huge cost to civil liberty, and this is without even going into the theoretical effects which removal of privacy may have on a democracy.

What benefits do you think would be gleaned from such a system, particularly given the rampant lack of oversight and transparency revealed by Snowden?

I think the rise of 'nationalism' in Scotland and to a lesser extent in Wales is an unsurprising reaction to what has for a very long time been an imposition of Englishness upon the Scottish and the Welsh. I'm not saying that Englishness is a bad thing because it isn't: it's a vital and integral part of our society.

It just shouldn't be a synonym for Britishness because it isn't. We can absolutely be One Nation. I voted Plaid Cymru but I don't support Welsh independence. I love the UK and want to make it better. When I'm done with my studies I'll have the kind of skillset that could feasibly take me literally anywhere in the developed world. But I don't want to go anywhere else, I want to stay in the UK. We have some gaping structural and constitutional problems but I want them to be fixed. Anyone who wants to make us 'One Nation' again simply cannot ignore the minority voices from all across the country, and that includes Wales and Scotland and Northern Ireland as well as minority voices in England, including those of the Cornish and even of UKIP supporters (despite my personal feelings re: the EU 4 million people is a lot of people even if it's a small number compared against the wider backdrop of the UK).",null,0,null,1432768722,null,0,false,0,crn1ptp,null,t3_37hzi0,null,t1_crn1ptp,null,t3_37hzi0,null,null,null,1433304032,null,27,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,27,null

The reason many of us oppose this 'seven day NHS' idea isn't because we don't want to work weekends (we already do!) but because the way the government wants to do this without massively increasing funding is by making us work weekends while also scrapping our banding - essentially cutting our wages by a third.

I'd take Milner all day long. The work rate and underrated ability would not only provide support for Walker but also help with Poch's high press style. In midfield i'd have Schneiderlin to add a bit of steel next to Bentaleb but also add good ball retention, with Yarmolenko on the other wing to fill the inside winger role with his pace, trickery and shooting abilities.

Apart from that i don't think the first team needs much more, just Ings as a back up or behind Kane in a support striker role and Trippier to provide cover at right back.

You may find that you receive funding from different parts of the organisation, this is the information as we understand it. If your financial allocation is any different please let us know as soon as possible.”

&gt;Jasmine House, previously known as Leicester Rape Crisis Centre, counsels about 60 women every week.
&gt;It costs £60,000 a year to maintain the centre, and £47,000 of that comes from Leicester City Council.
&gt;The council said it was having to make £100m of cuts by 2015 and all areas of spending had to be reviewed.

&gt;Nottingham Council - which has some of the highest levels of domestic abuse in the country - is also making spending reductions on domestic violence. Last year it spent £900,000, and in 2011 it plans to spend £571,000.

&gt;In North Somerset, the North Somerset Against Domestic Abuse group (NADA), could lose its entire £120,000 council grant, the majority of its funding. 

&gt;Mary Mason is director of Solace Women's Aid in London: ""We are facing cuts of approximately 25 per cent of our income over the coming year – as we work with approximately 4,000 women and children each year this means that 1,000 women and children who received a service last year will not be supported by us.

&gt;Services providing floating support like home and community workers are even worse hit, the survey - which has had 35 responses so far from Women's Aid member services across the country - found. Only two of 18 have had their contracts renewed for after March, and they do not know what their funding situation will be in 2011.

&gt;A quarter of the survey's respondents said they would have to close one or more services if they lose funding, with 40 per cent warning they would have to cut staff numbers and 20 per cent saying they would have to reduce the number of clients they took on.

&gt;""At the same time there has been a 25 percent increase in sexual crimes in London over past year.

&gt;As 155 women and more than 100 children turned away from refuges in one day 

&gt;Women’s Aid, the national domestic violence charity, is declaring a state of crisis in domestic violence services today, as the charity’s Annual Survey reveals shocking gaps in funding and provision for women experiencing domestic violence. The charity is warning that unless cuts to specialist gender-specific services end soon, an entire network of domestic violence providers in England is likely to collapse. 


http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-12402776

&gt;A charity which helps domestic abuse victims has said women and children could die as a result of funding cuts.

&gt;Devon County Council has proposed a 42% reduction to its annual £1.2m budget, after it initially considered scrapping it entirely.

&gt;It said no service could expect to be immune from cuts.

&gt;The council's £1.2m funding for Adva (Against Domestic Violence) Devon currently supports three separate charities - North Devon Women's Aid, the Domestic Violence and Abuse Service and Stop Abuse For Everyone (Safe).

Yes, quite a bit on and off between 16-18 years old before I went into the forces and then again when I was medically discharged out of the Army right in the middle of the recession of the early 90s.

What I did when I was 16-18 was to walk up and down industrial estates knocking on doors and go in every shop and amusement arcade in the town to find work and I used to do that 2-3 times a week. 

What I did when I left the Army as a fully qualified electronics engineer was take a job in a chicken factory putting cheese circles on turkey burgers 12hrs a day. 

What I didn't do was sit on my arse at home on a computer whining and bitching to the world how unfair life was, how the baby boomers had it better and how I should be given a job and money and a house and all the crap I see spouted online. I got off my backside and did something about it. 

There is always work out there although it may not be what you want to do or the hours you'd prefer and may involve doing things like getting up with the sun then putting in 10-12hrs a day doing something really shitty. Its funny how Eastern Europeans seem to have little trouble finding work in comparison to whining Brits, mainly because they're willing to do anything they can find.

My eldest son is 20. Since he was 14 years old he's spent a grand total of 2 months without a job and even that was only because his son arrived prematurely so he and his girlfriend were constantly going to the hospital. As soon as his son was going to come home he found a job. It took him a whole 2 days. Why? Because like me he's prepared to do anything so he does the graveyard shift in a factory earning far more than the minimum wage for his age which allows him at 20 years old to rent his own 3 bed house in a nice area and support his family without any help from anyone else. Meanwhile almost all of his mates who are like many from Generation Wipe My Arse on this subreddit are on the dole living at home scratting around on £50 a week whining how life is unfair and going nowhere which is precisely where they'll be in 10 years time because they're fucking bone idle entitled shits who want someone to hand them the life my son has on a plate for zero effort.

Realistically, 20 hours work a week will not be able to support your tuition and living costs if you don't have any other source of financial support. You might want to investigate specific universities to see if they have any scholarships you can apply for. My university department (politics) offers a fully-funded place to one American student a year but, as you can guess from that sentence alone, those types of scholarship are very rare but they do exist.

No worries. It's great to see people keen to migrate over here. I think the best starting point is to firstly decide what degree qualification would be best suited for your career and then work from that point onwards.

If the idea is to just jump start the team back into contention with a 2-3 year veteran manager, fine, but I'd almost rather give BR at least another half season to see if he can get it right before we get too desperate. I'm still firmly set on the notion that Klopp is currently the only guy you potentially blow the club up for, just because of his track record and his potential to be a longterm appointment.

Just gonna address this first: [Martin Luther King would've laughed at you.](http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html) I quote:

&gt; I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.

&gt; That has nothing to do with my point

It has everything to do with the context of your point, though. Which makes your point seem petty. **Context. Matters.**

&gt; It should have passed a long time ago, because she should be out of a job

Not enough people at Goldsmith's think so to trigger a referendum - so why do you care so much?

&gt; That makes requesting genocide fine then

She didn't request genocide. It was a joke. Good taste or not, it was not meant seriously. Which you admit. Stop arguing in bad faith.

&gt; I think some girls in Rotherham may disagree with you there

The vast majority of sex offenders are white, most of them men - fun pattern, eh? Sexual grooming of children lured into it *in public* (as opposed to meeting online or in private spheres) is statistically more likely to be committed by Asian men - that's a sociological phenomenon. It probably has to do with Asian men being overrepresented in public-facing, nocturnal, low-income jobs: taxi drivers, fast food, etc. So you know, it's perfectly valid to draw conclusions from it, but the conclusion is not ""Asians rape people more"" - it's ""Asian rapists trap their victims in public more than the majority of rapists, namely white men"". But yeah, sure, that case was horrific and everything the police did was a colossal fuckup that betrayed those girls totally. But it is not and never will be comparable in scale to [slavery - which counted *millions* of Africans enslaved in a large-scale economic system which built the wealth of Britain today.](http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/Slavery/articles/sherwood.html)

&gt; Apart from that whole Black Power thing

""Black Power"" is not a monolithic organisation - Black Panthers were not anti-white, but pro-self-defense (though individual members committed murders) (also, not that I agree with them or anything but ya know completeness' sake). The only properly anti-white ones IIRC were Nation of Islam - which made Malcom X leave. And they are much smaller in size than white racists in the US, not to mention they have no impact on structural injustice - which overwhelmingly benefits white Americans. [See for example segregated housing in Baltimore.](http://www.epi.org/blog/from-ferguson-to-baltimore-the-fruits-of-government-sponsored-segregation/)

&gt; Home Rule was 100 fucking years ago and the Troubles were in Northern Ireland

Go to a Catholic bar in NI and announce you're Protestant, go on. Go tell ethnic Irish people across the UK that the English are superior, go on. Tell Jeremy Clarkson's producer he's never been given shit for being Irish. See if they think the problem is over.

&gt; She didn't say that she wanted to get rid of 'wealthy white English men' (which is wrong on too many levels) but all white men, from America to Iran.

It's a fucking joke. It is not meant to be taken literally.

&gt; It is this vapid mentality which allowed Rotherham 

No, the vapid mentality there was ""oh, these girls are saying they were raped? Also is it racist if I accuse an Asian of a crime? Oh I bet the girls probably made it up, nvm.""

Institutionalized racism is non existent. The laws that are passed in this country do not discriminate based on race. Unless you know some laws we don't.

&gt;You're right, it does make no sense. The left-right spectrum is collectivist economics vs individualist economics, you can't go so far to one side you end up at the other. Not only that but this situation doesn't have anything to do with economics.

Left and Right leaning policies can focus on Social issues. Not solely economic ones. You know what I meant. 

&gt;No they don't.

It's quite clear that a group in a University have taken up this idea quite willingly.

I'm given to believe that diamond prices are hugely over inflated, but they remain so because there's some pressure on jewellers to buy diamonds which have their quality (carats) certified by De Beers.

My mother was talking last week about selling her old rings - she divorced my father over 20 years ago, and I think she may have her mother's or aunt's ring - but I think she's grossly unrealistic in expecting a few hundred quid for them.

There are lots of secondhand jewellers in Hatton Garden in London - the whole street as several in each building - many of whom buy scrap jewellery to melt it down. If you were nearby I would suggest walking door to door there; you might try Birmingham instead, but I doubt it's as good - [it looks to me like the jewellery quarter there is just an urban regeneration branding exercise.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery_Quarter) ",null,0,null,1432774291,null,0,false,0,crn4r8n,null,t3_37fvn3,null,t1_crn4r8n,null,t3_37fvn3,null,null,null,1433305465,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

There are dozens of micro-tactics, pressure instructions, positional roles, instructions on what to do without the ball, with the ball, speed of passing, range of passing, etc. that need to be altered in order to change one's major style of play. It could take anywhere from 2 games to upwards of 10 games for the players to understand and get comfortable with these tactical changes, and even more games after this in order to really get an idea of how well the tactics themselves work. Obviously we could not afford very many games to experiment with in the middle of a season. 

Managers often make minor changes in tactics between and during games- but these are scenarios and tactics that have already previously been discussed and understood by the team. Most of this practicing of new tactics occurs in the offseason. That is why it's silly to say that just because of one shit season, Balotelli will be offloaded.

Every civil liberty we now enjoy, all progress toward inclusion and a fairer society, used to be illegal, and only became legal because people were doing it, and people saw it was fine, and people demanded it be legal. 

What if we'd had snooping charters in the past (and I mean the technology for it too.). Would we have Gay equality movements? Because if every gay person was arrested the first time they ever did anything gay, how would anyone have seen that ""oh this is actually fine.""? It was illegal, and people were arrested and executed for it, so if the police had been able to tell whenever anyone did anything gay, they'd all have been locked up. All you'd know is that today 2 people were arrested for a crime you have no reason to object to being a crime.

Would we have been able to relax laws on weed if everyone who ever smoked weed was arrested? Most people wouldn't ever have done it, because they'd know they'd be arrested.

Would we have made social progress in any way? Would we have democracy? If people were unable to meet and say ""I disagree with the king/government, lets march on London and demand change"" without being arrested on the spot, would we have had the protests that led to our freedoms we have today? 

We don't know what we'll want to change in the future, but we know that if it's illegal now, then it will only be accepted if people break the law enough, and if everyone who breaks the law is arrested, nothing changes. 

Now that sounds like I'm advocating anarchy, but I'm not. Obviously people should be arrested for crimes, but only when people are reporting them for breaking those laws, this means people use their discretion. it allows the seeds of change to grow. If you're smoking weed in your own home, and your friends know, they probably won't call the cops, and they'll think about why you want to, they'll think about the law and if it's just.

For one, I think we can definitely hold on to Benteke for one more season.  There's no way he would move to Liverpool or Tottenham, and I don't see a true top level team in for him until he performs a whole season at his best.

More importantly the club becomes much more attractive to potential owners, and the likelihood of an ambitious group taking over increases dramatically.  Lerner's sales pitch will either be ""we are still in the premier league and made it to the FA Cup final"" or ""we just won our first trophy in a while under a new and exciting manager, we're playing in Europe next season, and the football side of our club is finally recovering from a transitional phase that turned the club into a much better business""

Finally, our recruitment would get a boost from playing in Europe.   I know the Europa League isn't the Champions League, but it's still continental competition.  Players want to play in the biggest competitions, and offering the premier league the Europa League gives us a leg up on most of our competition.

&gt; The suspicion and harsh questioning that greeted the one and only current sex worker... showed that there was little if any interest in being genuinely analytical of the Nordic model.

Presumably this was a reference to Laura Lee of the ""International Union of Sex Workers"". Out of curiosity, I looked up the transcript of her submission to the committee:

&gt; **The Chairperson:** I want to establish the extent of who you claim to represent.  It would be useful to know what the membership of the International Union of Sex Workers is.  You have talked about your vast experience, but how many people would you purport to speak for in that union?

&gt; **Ms Lee:** I have found myself in the position — I do not know whether you would call it fortunate or unfortunate — of becoming the voice for sex workers in Ireland.  That is because of stigma that I experienced myself.  In that regard, you could say that I speak for the vast majority of them, because I know, from speaking to sex workers myself, that they do not want this law brought in.  They are afraid, because they know the damage that it will do....

&gt; **The Chairperson:** I want to go back to my question.  You say that you speak for the vast majority.  I am trying to quantify that.  Can you tell me how many sex workers you purport to speak for?

&gt; **Ms Lee:** In the UK, because it is such a clandestine industry in some regards, statistics are hard to come by, but the estimates are that there are 80,000 sex workers in the UK.  That is across the broad spectrum and includes webcam strippers etc.

&gt; **The Chairperson:** Are they are all members of your international union?

&gt; **Ms Lee:** No, they are not.

&gt; **The Chairperson:** So, how many members does the International Union of Sex Workers have?

&gt; **Ms Lee:** I am not entirely sure about that.  I would have to look that up and come back to you.

&gt; **The Chairperson:** It is just that you said that you speak for the vast majority.

&gt; **Ms Lee:** Yes.

&gt; **The Chairperson:** I am trying to establish the credibility of the organisation that you purport to represent.  That is important, because, obviously, we will refer to this evidence session, and we need to know that what you have said comes from a credible organisation.  So, how many members are there in the International Union of Sex Workers?

&gt; **Ms Lee:** I would need to check that out and come back to you.

&gt; **The Chairperson:** OK.  How many of them are from Northern Ireland?

&gt; **Ms Lee:** Good question.  I honestly do not know, but I will find out for you.

Wow, this sounds like a completely legitimate ""union"", where its spokespeople have no idea how many members they have.

If you classify ""How many members does your organisation have?"" as ""suspicion and harsh questioning"", then I think you're the one who's not being ""genuinely analytical"" tbh.",null,0,null,1432780968,null,0,false,0,crn8kfp,null,t3_37b3p0,null,t1_crn8kfp,null,t3_37b3p0,null,null,null,1433307330,null,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1,null
