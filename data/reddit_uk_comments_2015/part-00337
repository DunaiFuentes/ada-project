You mean you think the conservatives are pro-LGBT?

&gt;a powerful group of conservative legislators this past week sought to sabotage one of the pillars of Cameron’s plan to broaden his party’s appeal — same-sex marriage. After a heated debate on the floor of the House of Commons, more conservatives voted against the bill than for it, forcing Cameron into the humiliating position of having to depend on the opposition Labor Party to push the legislation through the lower chamber.

They couldn't even support marriage equality, which - while a milestone - should really still be just a stepping stone. While I'd like to believe that Cameron championed it because he is a rarity in the party and actually cares about gay rights, the fact that afaik he's done nothing at all since then makes me think it was purely politics.",null,0,null,1440988078,null,null,false,0,culemxl,null,t3_3iyf1v,null,null,null,t1_cul4i91,null,null,null,1441598598,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

You'd be surprised how much stuff in use today was designed in the 1970's or earlier.  Especially when it comes to military kit.  It's never ""state of the art"" and it's aways been in development for a decade or more. 

The American F-15, for example, is still considered the king of the ring when it comes to air superiority (if only because of how bloody many of them exist) and that was originally designed in 1967, the F-16 is of a similar vintage.  Eurofighter, as another example, started life in 1986.   All of them are in use today and have been retrofitted with newer technologies over the years (and in the case of Eurofighter is ""state of the art"")... which is exactly what we've been doing to our submarines.

Obviously, the whole situation is utterly bizarre, but bizarre things do happen occasionally without foul play  - eg, there are quite a few well-known people who have accidentally killed themselves while... experimenting. I tend to think that you shouldn't attribute to conspiracy what can be explained without resorting to conspiracy.

The guy clearly had some relatively unusual (I assume sexual) interests - his landlord testified at the inquest that he had once tied himself to his bed and was unable to escape without help. It's not a massive leap to go from tying yourself up to confining yourself in a small space (if that's your thing).

It *is* possible that he locked himself in the holdall. There are videos on YouTube of people locking themselves into exactly the same make/model bag. The keys were in the bag - perhaps he intended to unlock himself but lost consciousness or couldn't reach them. Perhaps he intended to kill himself.

It's also possible that someone else was involved (in a non-murdering capacity). I read that he could have died within a few minutes of being locked in - if someone else locked him in as part of a sexual thing, it doesn't seem impossible to suggest that this person might not have realised how quickly he could have died. It would be pretty shocking to realise that you had accidentally killed someone in very weird circumstances. People behave unpredictably under stress - it wouldn't seem entirely unlikely for this hypothetical person to have panicked, tried to clean up their fingerprints (like they do in the movies...), done a runner and never told anyone what happened.

Those are two plausible and relatively mundane explanations for the poor guy's death. I know everyone loves a good conspiracy theory, but there isn't actually any evidence that is clearly inconsistent with those two possibilities.

null,null,jimmy17,null,null,null,"&gt;God, what an annoying person you are. That's the second post of yours in which fail to understand the argument yet make very confident statements about it.

I think you need to chill out a bit. You seem to be reading a tone into my comments that isn't there. I was simply chatting with you as I would with anyone else. I said that I thought you were wrong, explained my thought process and hoped for a civilised answer. I have conceded MANY times that I'm a bit unsure about the process but as I couldn't quite understand what you were trying to say then I wasn't going to just agree with you for the sake of it so I was hoping for a civilised discussion. Maybe the problem is we are here for different reasons. You're here to circlejerk, I am here to discuss the news.

If I upset you by not stroking your ego or by challenging your logic from the beginning of the process then I apologise. And please never go into academic science/mathematics. You don't have the temperament for it.

Anyway I realised since the last comment I posted that my last sentence explained what I had missed before.

&gt;we were only counting the number of people who died within a two week period of their assessment. I imagine many more people died during this period who didn't die within two weeks of an assessment.

I now understand that I had missed the full meaning of my own statement. I was missing the fact that the number quoted for the number of deaths is 1/26 of the total number of people who died in a year if we assume that deaths are distributed evenly as people who were found fit for work but died outside of this 2 week period were not counted. You therefore have to multiply out to get the proper number. A very obvious mistake in retrospect but it happens.

&gt;You could have seen that your calculation of 5,915 was way off the mark for deaths within 2 week intervals by multiplying it by 26. You get 153,800 people dying. This is a factor of more than 10 off what is predicted by the mortality rate for incapacity benefit claimants.

I didn't see it as I had overlooked the multiplication by 26. Like I say, a simple mistake in retrospect but mistakes happen.

Or perhaps someone will be driving from Heathrow to Cambridge and will offer lifts.

Of course, it's not going to make him dramatically drop his wage demands if he's on stupid money at Zenit.  But a quick internet search seems to suggest that he's on ~ €3.5m per year.  That's less than £50k/week.

EDIT:  Then again, [**this**](https://twitter.com/chelsea_hq/status/6116457595664302080) indicates that he's on £120k/week.  Which would preclude us, as well as an Italian team.  Who knows, if we and Milan are the only options for him, maybe he would restructure his contract.  Or Zenit will just keep him and sell some other non-Russian player instead.

Where the restaurant distributes the tips, as will be the case when they're paid by debit or credit card, the employer is the 'tronc master' and is liable to operate PAYE.  *(Where there is a tronc master who isn't the employer, the third-party tronc master is required to operate PAYE.)*

In strictness where tips aren't distributed *(i.e. they go straight into the server's pocket)* in strictness the server should declare it as additional earnings income for tax.  Although obviously it's not worth enforcing.

null,null,cephalus,null,null,null,"I think he did a great job tracking back and covering for Walker on that.  However, once again it becomes absolutely apparent that Dier's not a fullback and his instincts entirely let him down. Walker makes a surging run to the byline, crosses straight in to the keeper.  Ball gets rolled out to the Everton midfield, Walker trots back.  Midfielder lofts a ball out to cleverly, Dier immediately presses Cleverly and forces a backpass to the midfield (Excellent).  Walker slides in to try to intercept the backpass, completely misses, and then Cleverly releases to the empty space where Walker should be - and that Dier should be covering.

At the time Dier presses cleverly (just past the half line), we've got Dier covering for Walker, Dembele covering for Dier, and Rose, Vert, and Toby all properly in position.  Walker makes the play on the ball where Dembele would normally be.  At this time it's fine - Dier has Cleverly closely marked, the defensive line is intact, and Dembele and Bentelab are properly marking the space in the center.

This is where it falls apart.  Dier starts walking back towards the center of the pitch (poor, because he's supposed to be covering for Walker), Dembele is still standing in a defensive mid spot, and Bentelab was just above the two center backs.  Ross Barkley is standing in the middle of the center spot, completely unmarked.  Kone is marked tight by Rose, Lukuka is marked by Vert.  The ball gets played into Barkley.  Walker is now sprinting back towards his spot, but he's basically standing on the half line.  Dier is responsible for Cleverly, because Dier knows that Walker hasn't gotten back yet, and he can clearly see Dembele and Bentelab have a shield in front of the centerbacks.  Toby isn't marking anyone (other then the diagonal passing lane along the floor to Cleverly) but his positioning is appropriate - he can still come down and cover a run in from Cleverly.  (This is at 40:30).

At 40:31, Barkley has the ball at his feet near the edge of the circle, and he's ready to play the ball.  There is still 10 yards between Barkley and any Spurs player.  Kone and Lukaku are a few yards in front of Jan and Rose, inbetween them.  Kone starts making a diagonal run in the channel between Rose and Jan, and Rose covers the outside.  Walker is still in the middle of nowhere, Chadli is marking space, but there are *four* Spurs players generally between Cleverly and Barkley.  Cleverly is making a dash down the line, now some 10 yards behind and 10 yards to the left of Dier, who has become aware of the situation.  

At 40:32, Barkley has lofted the ball towards the run of Cleverly.  He's onside by the line of Rose - Jan - Toby.  The ball had to be played in the air, because Dembele and Toby had the passing lanes covered.  By the time Cleverly receives the ball, he's 5 yards behind and outside of Dier, and Jan is literally sitting on Kone's shoulder, with Rose properly in position to mark Lukaku or Kone depending on the run.

At 40:34, the problem is apparent.  Cleverly now has half a yard on Dier, directly behind him, streaking towards the ball and the penalty area.  This happened because Dier just let a yard too much space for the run of Cleverly when Dier was looking away.  This forces Dier into the tackle from behind.  Toby is in excellent space to cover for Dier, Jan and Rose and Bentelab are covering the middle properly, and Dembele still has Dier's space marked.  (People often underestimate the importance of just marking space.)  

Two things happened - First, Mason and Kane both made runs towards the 6 yard area for the cross of Walker.  This is *good* and by design.  We had three players running into that area, (Chadli was right behind), against 3 defenders.  The cross was poor from Walker, and straight to Howard.  Howard is able to roll it out to McCarthy for the initial loft to Cleverly.  We've got a big gap in the midfield for them to exploit, but that's only because Dier, Dembele, and Bentelab didn't press and instead fell back to cover.  (Considering that Walker, Mason, Chadli, and Kane were too far up to help with that press, that's not a bad idea).  This meant that Barkley had all the time in the world to turn and make the pass to Cleverly.  Second, Dier missed the run of Cleverly and ended up way behind him.  Dier recovered excellently though, but that's why he had to make the tackle from behind.  Toby couldn't cover Dier's initial release of Cleverly, because he was marking space in the middle, preventing Lukaku and Kone from splitting Jan.  Dier only had to make the tackle because he misplayed Cleverly in the first place.

* You can open one ISA per year.
* You can pay into one ISA per year.
* However, you can transfer the balance from an existing ISA into a new one to get the new interest rate and not lose any of your allowance for the year.

So say you had £6000 in one ISA. You've not done anything since April, so you open a new ISA now. You can immediately transfer that ISA, even across different banks, and still put the maximum amount in for the year (£15k now I think?). You do have to be a bit careful though as you can't do it by literally just bank transferring, and some banks also won't let you transfer in so you have to do some research.

We should have looked for mobility, and we did, with Sanchez but after we lost him we never looked for anyone similar. That side had a lot of movement and were very direct. Now we have Benteke and the side needs to learn to play with him. Your best player Coutinho wants someone who makes the runs of the shoulder of the defender and not to play to feet. We seem to have a side that wants to play one way but doesn't have the personnel to do it at the moment. It can dramatically improve when Sturridge comes back. Remains to be seen if he still has the pace after the injuries. 

Bottomline is that Rodgers has it in him to really model an attacking unit.

A good list, but can I just say how much I hate this ""communities"" thing? 

Is there really such a thing? People talk about the ""gay community"" or the ""jewish community"" like what, do they pay subscriptions and have a fucking AGM or something?

IDK, but I have many friends who might fit into some of these ""communities"" yet none of them ever refer to themselves as being part of that community because not everyone self identifies according to that label.

For example, I wouldn't introduce myself saying ""Hi I'm Jon, the Gay Jew, pleased to meet you"" yet people are quite happy to say ""he's a member of the &lt;insert name of minority category here&gt; community, you know"" 

Now if someone wants to refer to someone who is black/gay/muslim/gypsy whatever, its as if we are compelled to refer to them being part of some imaginary community, instead of just flat out saying that they are black/gay/muslim/gypsy whatever, the extra level of de-personalising semantic gymnastics giving a veneer of politically correctness to the fact that we're talking about a black/gay/muslim/gypsy/whatever person.

Tens of thousands of people have died, torture has come back onto the world stage. Been canonized practically into law by Guantanamo and Baghra...[discusses targeted drone strikes assassinations] and so this will go on and this will make the world more dangerous and worse and worse and worse.

I vaguely remember Paisley, but really I've been looking closely at managers' decisions since Kenny's first stint.

Of course all managers are criticised all the time for everything they ever do. Is your point that this somehow invalidates any specific criticism anyone might have of the current manager?

Players have always been played out of position, I agree. But I made a much more specific point than that. Rodgers has been here for a while now. These are not players he has inherited; he has built this squad himself and in some parts of the pitch (such as striker positions) he has turned over the playing staff multiple times since taking over.

So when he ignores the players *he has brought in himself* to play a right-footer at left back or leave all of his strikers on the bench and play midfielders up front *and it is clearly hurting the team* that's just fucked up. We're not talking about Jason McAteer playing wing-back (because he was the best choice at the time) or converting players' positions long-term (Lawrenson, Thomas et al. becoming centre backs) or making do during an injury crisis. This is a persistent and perverse habit of not trusting his own signings and forcing square pegs into round holes for no obvious reason. It's especially harmful because he's doing it with young players in a way that can stall their development in their best positions.

On the other topic: how do propose we will score goals with a single striker system. Are you expecting Henderson, Coutinho et al. to suddenly become prolific, or is Benteke on for a 60-goal season?

I am glad that they saved us from administration, but, many forget, any new owner would have done the same.

I have this theory that they hired Rodgers so that they could learn about the sport as they go on. Any mishaps will be chalked off in the eyes of the fans as the manager did not have enough experience. They are buying on the cheap to understand the nitty gritty things which are a part and parcel of running a club. They are then selling these players at a higher price to recuperate their own initial costs of purchasing the club and the stadium.
I don't blame them and at times I don't agree with them but they are running a business and clearly they are successful enough to know what they are doing.

However, I don't like the way they are handling the players who don't work out. The leaks to the press is extremely unprofessional and unethical. 

Personally I don't see us winning the league or the champions league in the next 5 years. We just don't have the expertise in management nor the players to win us those two. We are going to be a mid table team always punching above our weight. I don't see this trend changing unless we get proper coaches to back the management and a couple of world class players at their peak and performing week in and week out.

All of the teams you mention have midfielders who can weigh in with good numbers of goals. If we had a few midfielders who could be expected to comfortably get into double figures I'd be totally happy, but realistically we don't.

Secondly, last summer we signed strikers who have done well in partnerships with other forwards rather than isolated. If you're going to sign a Balotelli or a Lambert, he's going to need a partner or you've wasted your money and his time.

This season, we have Benteke who probably *can* play on his own up front - he's awesome and can do most things - but he's not getting players up around him. That's something that can be worked on in training, but it was a problem all season last time around whenever Balotelli or Lambert was in the frame.

Not longer than 5 minutes as it can irritate the skin or clog the pores back up. Then I rinse it off as good as I can. It won't come all off that's why it's important to cleanse with a mild (foam, etc.) cleanser afterwards. I use the HadaLabo one, but anything with a PH around 5.5 should be ok.

I just recently got the Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil. It has an emulsifier in it and washes off clean! I really like it cause the normal baby oil took way more time to rinse off. But I think the plain baby oil did a better job at getting some grits out. It's also dirt cheap and available everywhere.

After I started oil or ""double cleansing"" my skin got significantly less oily and it even got rid off some of those stubborn cc's. A lot of people swear by it but some break out with this method. Mineral oil is a lot less likely to break you out than coconut oil for example. You can find out by patch testing what will work best for you. It's a great way to get rid of sunscreen, makeup and excess oil.

I'm not sure but I think you shouldn't leave the acid on for 20 minutes? The longest I do is 10 minutes, rinse it off and then wait 20 minutes before I go to my next step. I don't have the instructions anymore though so I can't remember what the recommended max time was. Hope I could help and good luck! :)",null,0,null,1441004692,null,null,false,0,cullo15,null,t3_3hs8cd,null,null,null,t1_culh60h,null,null,null,1441602059,null,1,null,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,1,null

Nuclear weapons are a long term factor which  deters countries from considering attacking us because they are aware that rather than losing, we would respond with a nuclear strike out of desperation if we were going to lose, making there no actual benefit to conquering us. The same goes vice-versa.

The result is that when the Russians or insert generic enemy here sit down to decide on military spending, the benefit of having a force capable of actually invading us is massively reduced. As tends to be the case, this results in significantly reduced military spending on both sides, as both sides do not fear full invasion. With less spent on the military, less likelihood of war and fewer tensions. The result is greater stability.

The fact that no-one is currently in a position to suddenly attack us if we get rid of nuclear weapons is the consequence of a long term nuclear defence policy, not a reason to get rid of it (NATO also helps)",null,0,null,1441005125,null,null,false,0,cullsby,null,t3_3j0lou,null,null,null,t1_culgyps,null,null,null,1441602115,null,72,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,72,null

Witsel started out as a winger, with the midfield being occupied by Fellaini and Defour at Standard. Since then, he has moved first to Attacking/Holding midfielder to a more Defensive role now.

From a comparison view, I think Huddlestone is somewhat applicable, if Huddlestone was worth 40 million euros. He can sometimes seem sluggish and is often criticized of being lazy, but is very trustworthy and a good ""vacuum"" in the midfield. He's not an anklebiter or enforcer, in the way Dier has been for us recently, he will make his interceptions higher up the pitch and earlier in the opposition's attack. He's also very capable of a smart throughball or a skillful run of play, but will be just as happy sitting behind the playmaker looking to recover the second ball.

There are only a few clubs in history which have successfully played in the fashion that Liverpool are aspiring to. BR said 'death by football' when he started and despite the changes to formation, he hasnt really abandoned that. But you can spend all the money in the world trying to play idillic football like Barcelona but realistically, playing pragmatic football like say a Ferguson/Mourinho team (historically) is the way to get points which is what we are ultimately in the business of doing.

I never said having money was a guarantee, however they came into a team that was already world series caliber and threw some money at the finishing pieces, since then they have strayed from that and tried to make actual baseball decisions which has drastically set back the franchise. Furthermore the ""Evil"" comes from their tendency to insult, and belittle anyone that is either fired or leaves the organization on their own. It is highly unprofessional and they largely operate like an ownership group comprised of petty children.

&gt;**So how did you go from working in Wales to becoming Everton's first choice keeper?**

&gt;First I played at some lower league sides, Winsford Utd and Bury. I wasn't exactly living like a king. My wife and I moved into a house with terrible insulation, the bill for the heating was so high that we had to sell almost all of our furniture. We just kept the beds. I didn't have a car either. When Everton loaned me to Bury, their coach had to come and pick me up.

&gt;**It's said that even in your first season at Everton you used to travel to training by bike**

&gt;No, that's a myth. How could I have traveled from North Wales to Everton with a bike every day? I'm certainly no Lance Armstrong. But there was something embarassing that happened to me in that context. One day I didn't know how I could get home. I asked the coach Howard Kendall if he could give me a lift, and he thought I was pulling his leg.

[note: not entirely confident of that last sentence, ""auf den Arm nehmen"" can mean a bunch of things and my German's not good enough to be so sure which is meant here. But that certainly makes more sense than ""he thought I wanted a hug""...]

&gt;**You worked with Kendall for a longt ime afterwards. How was your relationship?**

&gt;We understood each other. If he tried to wrongly blame me for a goal we'd conceded, I'd just say ""well, fuck off"". Then he'd look at the video again and take his accusation back. Neither of us was resentful. Howard a special grasp of situations, that only the 
best managers have.

&gt;**What do you mean, exactly?**                                                                       
                                                                                                      
&gt;Over the years you hear the same things from managers over and over, eventually you get tired of it. Once when we had an FA Cup game against Stoke, he simply opened the window in the changing room, so we could hear the noise of the crowd. The manager just said ""Those are the people you're playing for"". Nothing more than that. That was the best motivational speech I heard in my career. 
 
&gt;**Goalkeepers can feel the atmosphere of the crowd very strongly, did you find it  motivation or pressure?**

&gt;Honestly, neither. I had blinkers on, I wasn't really aware of anything around me. If you have the opposition crowd having a go at you the whole game, you just do one thing: Win the game, wave to them after the final whistle and head back to the changing room. No better response.                                                                    

&gt;**In a game against Leeds you got so frustrated that you spent the whole half-time break sitting against the post**

&gt;If you feel something's right, you have to go through with it. I had to clear my head. Many people took it as a protest, because my contract discussions had fallen through. But that's not true, I was annoyed because of the game. We were 2-0 behind, and I needed
some peace. Where could I go? In the changing room it was too loud, and there was nowhere else in the stadium. At the post I could catch my breath, because I was able to just ignore the crowd and their shouts. 

&gt;**Even the fans at Goodison Park didn't impress you?**

&gt;Well, not in a way that I'd lose concentration. With one exception: the semifinal of the Cup Winners' Cup in 1985, against Bayern. Then I really got blown away. I've never experienced anything like it before or since, the fans won that game for us. Before the game it took us an hour to get our bus through the crowd. Bayern at the time were  one of the best teams in the world even took the lead. But the crowd was so unbelievably loud, we turned it around and won 3-1. It was like the film ""Gladiator"".
                                                                                                                         
&gt;**How did you celebrate?**

&gt;I went home and drank a cup of tea. That was it. When it's over, it's over.

&gt;**I ask because even today, Everton fans talk about how you hated celebrating. Supposedly after winning the 1984 FA Cup you refused to touch the trophy**

&gt;Yeah, that's true. I found it embarassing. If I've won the trophy, I've won it. I don't have to show it off to everyone.

&gt;**And on your second cup win in 1995 you just disappeared**

&gt;I knew that it was my last game at Wembley. We beat Manchester United 1-0, and I thought I'd celebrate how I wanted to. So I sat myself in my car, relaxed, and drove home. On the motorway I picked up a couple of people who had a puncture. They were Manchester United fans.

&gt;**What did the fans say, about the opposing keeper taking them back?**

&gt;I didn't mention anything about the game, of course. They'd had a shitty day already, I didn't want to make it worse with some cliched sayings. And they didn't realise that it was me. They thought I was just some idiot who looked like Neville Southall, after all
normally I'd have been at the winner's banquet.

Or, the pictures ... show something else... This was an assassination attempt and is yet another tragedy upon a tragedy, upon a tragedy.”

Those are the words he said. They don't need to be twisted. Coming from an MP they're stupid, but then they were said on the now-banned PressTV so presumably he thought that they were spoken among friends.

Having said that, [previous articles](http://www.sunnation.co.uk/corbyn-invited-friend-to-parliament-who-rejoiced-in-death-of-uk-soldiers/) about him appear more damaging, and these are nothing compared to what will come later.

At the very least, as a politician he really should be (or should have been) more careful with his language, appears to have a never-ending list of historical things someone trying to be a prime minister of an entire country made up of different people shouldn't have done, and an motley selection of associates with deeply unpleasant views people on this sub would normally condemn. Claiming he's never met some of these people before being shown photos of him sitting next to them makes him look like either your normal liar politician or a doddery old man.

Maybe he can make a fresh start with the electorate upon becoming leader of the opposition by finally saying whether or not he approves of the IRA's bombing campaign. It's not something the leader of a major political party would normally find so difficult to do, but for some reason every time someone asks him, he talks about Bloody Sunday, or most recently says it's a bad phone connection and hangs up. Then again, he's the man who invited Gerry Adams to the Commons two weeks after the Brighton bombing which had tried to assassinate the elected prime minister of the country, so there you go.

And he's about to become leader of Labour. Haha! Basically we will have no opposition in this country.

null,null,lergerhs,capaldi,Capaldi,null,"&gt; am I the only one that thinks there was something missing this time around? Anyone else kind of feel like Clara, loving the Doctor for who he was and not who he is now?

Capaldi's great, but Clara's character just doesn't make sense. The Doctor is for some reason really caring of her, but their entire relationship feels very hollow; based on what the audience has seen of their interactions, they should not be so close. Characters do tend to earn the sympathies of the audience, but I just don't care about Clara at all; she's perfect at everything, and a bit mean. Relationships with Rose or the Ponds felt much more organic. Bad writing, really. She fulfills the job of companion, but I would prefer to see anyone else do it. Time for a new one. Her purpose was the awful series 7 storyline. She could have been a useful storytelling tool, because she was just female 11 in series 7 (also dull), to show how drastically different the Doctor is, but they didn't follow up on it, and even if they did it would be spent.

I wouldn't say Capaldi's Doctor is nonchalant about people dying at all. He's very objective, detached, and apathetic, rather than the warm friend of all people everywhere because humans are the best. He gave the creatures in Flatline a chance, even though they appeared hostile. Other NuWho Doctors wouldn't have stood for them after the first five minutes. Tied into this is the thing about an ego. I don't think he has an ego problem. He desires to explore and learn everything, which makes him objectively more knowledgeable, and rather than a desire to flaunt it he lacks a desire to hide it. He just doesn't care about coming off as rude; he has more important problems. Sherlock, I would say, definitely has a narcissistic, huge ego problem, despite very limited knowledge of most things.

I like Capaldi's Doctor a lot. A cold alien accompanied by a warm human. That's how it was originally supposed to be, and it's come back to that. It doesn't work that well when the human is Clara, or when run by Moffat who makes the sci-fi a plothole-ridden fairy tale, but it is a brilliant dynamic. He's not a hero to the human race, he's a single alien who, in his mad theory-chasing and exploration, happens to occasionally stumble upon problems he is the only one fit to solve.",null,0,null,1441011171,null,null,false,0,culn8ll,null,t3_3iyza6,null,null,null,t3_3iyza6,null,null,null,1441602899,null,2,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2,null

I don't know about this.

&gt; What are my rights when it comes to living somewhere other than where I am now? I need to find SOMEWHERE close to the home. Could my parents sign me out to live back at home temporarily? It's not an ideal option as I don't cope very well with being at home (Which explains why I'm in care) but surely an exception can be made for me to go home for 2-3 weeks so I can live near my education?

You're on an order which I believe still classes you as a child (normally people can live by themselves as of 16 in UK) so you do not have the right to live anywhere other than where social services has placed you. You haven't told us the circumstances which caused you to be put into care so I can't answer this properly, but your parents are not responsible for you, and probably will not be allowed to be responsible for you ever again, so I think you are stuck until you turn 18.

&gt; Could I sign myself out in any way shape or form temporarily into some sort of housing (Not permanently) without coming out of care? Something like a YMCA? Probably not but Maybe there's something you guys have heard of?

Oscars fluidity and link up with matic  and hazard is missed dearly. Without him linking the front line to the deep mid there is a feel of 5 offensive guy and 5 defenders with no team fluidity.
I also think that there is a real lack of true competition in some areas mainly the deep midfield and defense. I don't think mou should just axe players after a bad match, but a run of 3  is time to shake things up. I want to see baba at left, Dave at right back.

With the rise of automation ( [Excellent CGP grey video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) ), directly subsidising employment reduces unemployment and makes everything cheaper and thus produces more for GDP. Only the most laissez-faire of economists disliked tax credits, plenty dislike high minimum wages. 

Now I agree we need to improve productivity, and raising the minimum wage can force workers to do that so they get/stay employed, but those that don't will only end up an unemployed unproductive drain on society, and besides education spending is a much more important aspect of productivity than the minimum wage could ever be, not that we'll see a penny of the tax credits savings go there.

I think it's important that left-wing and centrist voices don't let the Tories pretend that they're the only party helping businesses, especially self-employed people and small businesses (who employ far more people for their revenue size) as businesses are the employers and job creators. That doesn't mean we can't punish exploitative employers, quite the opposite, if we help businesses we should get more of a say in how they're run and weed out the bad and promote the good (though we need to be careful how authoritarian we are about it).",null,0,null,1441013076,null,null,false,0,culnohy,null,t3_3ithf6,null,null,null,t1_cul64lb,null,null,null,1441603108,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

&gt; ](http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=122) while British people treat the comparatively small number of refugees at Calais with the sort of hysteria that you would expect a zombie horde to be met with. We have pledged to accept [only a few hundred](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-says-britain-will-accept-just-a-few-hundred-more-syrian-refugees-despite-4-million-looking-for-new-home-10332104.html) which for a country like ours, nevermind our responsibility in creating the regional instability in the first place, is shameful.

'Take in' to the UK means to welcome into our society as one of our own, with an implicit understanding that everyone coming here deserves the same opportunities and minimum standard of living. 

In Lebanon, not so much. It's easy to take in a million refugees when the government does so little to help them. There are no camps, they only get food vouchers from the UN world food programme, 80% pay for their own accommodation [and the Lebanese are happy to charge $100/month for a dirty tent]. For everything they are reliant on NGOs* and whatever they can scratch together working in the fields.

So bringing up Nigeria is baffling since their situations are practically identical. 

Millions of Somalians have also fled their country. Hundreds of thousands have been granted refugee status in neighbouring countries such as Kenya and Ethopia. But this is still regarded as one of the worst and most pressing humanitarian crises. 

Lastly, there's a key distinction between how economic migrants (no matter how poor) and asylum seekers are regarded by the human rights acts England and the majority of other countries have *signed*. England (pre EU) and most other countries such as Turkey have the immediate right to reject all economic migrants, but the same can not be said for 
asylum seekers. No matter if you think the lower class Pakistanis have it worse than the Yazidi womem who have been faced with systematic rape, Yazidi children that are forced into slavery and Yazidi men who are immediatey executed once captured.

Now, Hazard either looks tired or uninterested to take on defenders. Going past the eye test, I looked it up on Squawka and he was averaging around 5 successful take ons per 90 minutes last year. This year, he's down to 3.5. Hope the international break lets him get a little bit of rest and lights a fire under him. Fabregas has just been in poor form since January. We know he's not great defensively, but he's been poor just passing too. He's showing desire but I think he's fatigued and we should play RLC.

Another issue is Willian. He has all the ability in the world, but he plays like he's terrified of doing something wrong and always goes for the safe option unless it's an obvious situation where he has no choice. He's a great dribbler. So why does he not use it to take on defenders? Why does he instead of decide to pass it backwards or sideways?

I say the majority of problems will get solved if we drop Ivanovic. I think dropping Fabregas for RLC and Willian for Oscar will also help out tremendously going forward.

It's like with the Ukraine thing. I don't think Putin is some super villain who *wants* to conquer the baltic and reclaim ""lost soviet territory"", but think about it. If eastern Europe left a perfect opportunity for him to do that, with low defences and left it wide open, he would do it. If it wasn't just Ukraine left wide open and caught with their pants down, he would never throwaway the opportunity to steam roll as far west as possible. It's simply strategically sensible, but he's not going to do it for the sake of it if there is no ease involved and it will be costly.

If you give a foreign country a perfect chance to swoop in and take your shit without repercussions it will likely happen when it massively suits them and when the opportunity is greatest.",null,0,null,1441014123,null,null,false,0,culnx5o,null,t3_3j0lou,null,null,null,t1_cullsby,null,null,null,1441603220,null,14,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

If you spend too much and run up huge debts, you end up bankrupt. We came very close to that in the late 1970s. A number of things happened. A few powerful unions managed to secure astonishingly high pay for their members which led to those industries becoming unviable. The government started printing money which ended up with inflation peaking at 26% per annum and the government having to go to the IMF for a bailout. Austerity requirements were incorporated into the conditions of the loan which led to massive cuts in public expenditure.

to above 20 percent, most of them unskilled youth; and (3) depress government revenue collection by
USD1.5 billion while simultaneously increasing government expenditure by USD1.1 billion due to the
surge in demand for public services, bringing the total fiscal impact to USD2.6 billion. Across all key
public services, the surge in demand is currently being partly met through a decline in both the access to

null,null,slippyg,null,Housing Officer,null,"&gt; Is there anything I can do to make Social Services make me higher priority to find a place? I am NOT missing out on my education another year because of them.

Sort of. Social services have a duty to find you accommodation until you are 18. However, it is very difficult to find accommodation for young people, especially quickly. You can ask for an advocate to help with this and you should have a pathway plan which social services should be following.

&gt; What are my rights when it comes to living somewhere other than where I am now? I need to find SOMEWHERE close to the home. Could my parents sign me out to live back at home temporarily? It's not an ideal option as I don't cope very well with being at home (Which explains why I'm in care) but surely an exception can be made for me to go home for 2-3 weeks so I can live near my education?

Social services can't force you to live anywhere once you're 16. They have a duty to find you accommodation, though.

&gt;Could I sign myself out in any way shape or form temporarily into some sort of housing (Not permanently) without coming out of care? Something like a YMCA? Probably not but Maybe there's something you guys have heard of?

You can sign yourself out of care at 16. I wouldn't do this unless you feel you have absolutely no other option. [Here](http://www.frg.org.uk/images/Advice_Sheets/16-support-for-young-people-leaving-care.pdf) is a good advice leaflet for your rights if you do decide to leave care. If you were looked after for more than 13 weeks before you turned 16 then you are entitled to a lot of support **but you don't *have* to accept it.**

It is very difficult to find accommodation as a 16-17 year old, you won't be able to rent privately and adult hostels will most likely, not take anyone under 18. There may be a local hostel for young people but it's quite likely that this is full and has a waiting list. You cannot claim benefits as a care leaver under 18.

&gt; What do I do in general? Was applying for this college a bad idea?

Keep nagging social services to death. Do whatever you can to go to college without putting yourself at risk of harm. Make it clear to them that's here you want to be and refer to your pathway plan.

We removed the nukes from Ukraine and look what happened to them. Russia wouldn't be invading if they had nukes.

Most of the countries you talked about are in NATO and thus have assurances of protection if they are attacked. Countries near Russia that aren't in Nato and don't have nukes are pretty vulnerable.

The countries that are at risk are not in Nato and close to or bordering Russia.

That's not relevant.

&gt;  it is a relatively cheap insurance policy against what may become nuclear threats in the future.

No, it is not. If there is no case in which we would use them, then it is not a useful option. The insanity that would ever consider using them, would be evidence of our having lost.. and badly. We should get rid of them if there is any risk of our leaders becoming so insane that they might consider using nukes. Nukes are not an attack on the enemy, they are an attack on the civilians who suffer that enemy. There is no justification for using nukes outside of extreme unrealistic unlikely scenarios where tactical nukes are helpful against underground military targets.

It would be set at about £11 nationally, and more than £12 in London, and would be a priority for a Labour government led by Burnham in 2020.

So if the Minimum Wage is set at £9 in 2020 as you suggest, there would be a £2 difference between it and Burnham's Living Wage. That £2 would be the space in which this system of tax incentives would operate.

Personally I think it's a sensible enough idea. If you want to increase wages but you don't want to increase the hard and legally-enforced Minimum Wage for fear of causing economic knock-ons, you use tax incentives to encourage wages instead.

For one, companies only pay Corporation Tax on profits.

If you link the Living Wage to increased Corporation Tax, you ensure you only hit companies who are making a profit and can afford the hit. Companies that are only making a very slim profit might still find that it is preferable to keep their wage bills down and pay the extra tax; but as their profit grows, that extra % of tax would grow larger and larger too- at some point, it becomes more cost effective to start paying their staff properly instead.

null,null,Homospatial,null,null,null,"&gt;That paper looks to be about the US.. and the US insurance industry and costs are badly warped from reality.

Unless you can demonstrate how this would effect the main point of the paper this comment doesn't mean much. 

&gt;In the UK, costs are associated with aging population and associated old age diseases.

Prove that increasing age is the *main* driver of increasing health care costs. 

http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/22/6/27.full.html

Another paper which covers this issue is above. Again this is from the US, but it gives some reasons as to the main reasons that health care costs increase:

&gt;Although the projected increase in the fraction of elderly in the total population from the current 12.7 percent to about 20 percent by 2030 is not a trivial matter in health policy...the bulk of the rapid annual growth in national spending in the past has been driven by other factors that increase per capita spending **for all age groups**. Key factors include rising per capita incomes, the availability of promising but costly new medical technology, workforce shortages that can drive up the unit cost of health care.

null,null,kingofeggsandwiches,null,null,null,"It's your argument that doesn't make sense. Saying things like ""it's pretty obvious there is a link to cannabis and mental health"" is ridiculous, it's not, as you seem to believe, putting ""two and two together"". If it were obvious there wouldn't be so much research into its behaviour with the body, both positive and negative, going on currently. 

There is a some relationship between cannabis usage and people with a predisposed disposition to mental illness, that's about all we know. However we find this relationship with virtually all psychoactive drugs. Alcohol has been shown have all these same relationships. Furthermore when all the information is compared cannabis is shown be a very low harm substance overall in terms of the number of people negatively affected, much lower than alcohol and other illegal drugs.

You say two wrongs don't make a right, obviously not, but you should start from the assumption that substance abuse is not something we can make disappear.  It makes sense to make low harm substances available so hopefully those who are drawn to substances abuse will mostly turn lower harm substances, there is also a relationship between mental health and substance abuse generally FYI.

Furthermore you're the one who is naive, and also pretty dogmatic  imo. There is no reason to assume cannabis legalisation would strain the mental health services. There's not even reason to believe that cannabis usage would increase, like I said usage seems to actually decrease in countries that implement legalisation. It could also be that  legalisation effectively saved the mental health services money by decreasing costs spent on treating those afflicted with mental health issues related to alternative substances (e.g. spice and other legal highs). Finally even if mental health services did receive increased strain due to cannabis legalisation, a tax on a regulated cannabis industry would raise revenue in the hundreds of millions which the government could use to respond to that strain. There would also be a massive amount of government spending saved that is currently spent on keeping cannabis illegal, in the police, justice system, and prison system for example. 

You act like every other cannabis user would suffer long term mental health issues which is absurd, if anything is certain it's that the money made from the industry would no doubt outweigh the cost in taxes on the medical side. Remember that people are already using cannabis, so that when looking at the ""cost"" of legalisation you can only look at the change in usage patterns. The facts are: there's no reason to think there'll be a change, if patterns do change then we don't know how - could be better, could be worse, if there is a change for the worse we don't know it's magnitude so it might be insignificant, and even if it's not insignificant it can almost certainly be paid for with the revenues received from legalisation. 

There are literally no good reasons to not legalise cannabis because regardless of whether you love it and want it legal everywhere or want to see it's usage eradicated, legalisation is still the best chance you have to achieve your goals. What's so naive about your little ""stove"" analogy is that it assumes our hand (or at least the vast majority of our hand) isn't already in the fire.",null,0,null,1441017231,null,null,1441017806,0,culomt9,null,t3_3iyaya,null,null,null,t1_culo0u6,null,null,null,1441603557,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The changes I would make:

* Willian &gt; Oscar. We need somebody with end product playing as our 10 and I think Oscar is a perfect fit with Hazard and Pedro. I know everybody, including myself, love Willian's work rate and how much he tracks back, but maybe it's time to accept he has no end product. He's simply not aggressive and it holds us back. He's an amazing dribbler, but he always opts to pass it backwards or sideways when he gets to a defender instead of taking him on. Plus, he is hilariously inconsistent when it comes to finishing. Oscar is probably our third best finisher regardless of the form he's in.

* Fabregas &gt; RLC. RLC impressed me in his debut. Did everything right and I think he'd be a great fit with Matic. I really want to see him reach his potential with us. I'm kind of glad we didn't get another midfielder because if we won't bother to incorporate youth who fit a position playing poorly, then when will we do it? Fabregas and Ramires haven't cut it. Shouldn't our next option be to test our RLC before spending money on guaranteed starter? I also think Fabregas need to be benched since he looks fatigued and it might light a fire under his ass.

If I was in charge, I would be looking to move Trident to the North East of England (assuming suitable coastline exists which is strategically/logistically viable).

The SNP don't want the base at Faslane - or at least they say they don't. And presumably a sizeable portion of Scottish people don't want it either.

But the main problem is that the SNP hang it over our heads during independence debates. Obviously the Trident system is incredibly important to the whole country, but it gives the SNP massive bargaining power to kick up a fuss against it. 

If we moved it to England it would 

1. Give the SNP/Scottish people something they want, and something less to complain about it.
2. Put a lot of jobs (around 8,000 according to the article) into the N.E. of England. Not just the workers at the base, but also the construction, maintenance and upgrades required.
3. Lessen the bargaining power of Scotland during any sort of independence debate.
4. Lessen the impact and expense of a Scottish exit, if it *were* to happen.

They spoke everyday and he listened; I've heard their feedback played a major role in the sackings of Pardew and Adkins. So when he went due to disagreements with the owners, they took his side. How could they trust the owners now?

- Poch leaving. We all had a feeling he was going, but in hindsight I feel stupid for believing he would stay. His relationship with Cortese was so strong, remember that picture of him leaving St Mary's after their final meeting? Prowse said Poch told the players in April he was leaving, but I bet you anything that wasn't news to them. 

- Lambert. After everything he did for us, morally we couldn't deny him his dream move. We just couldn't. Or could we? It wouldn't fill me with confidence as a player.

They bought the team in 2002. The Red Sox won their first World Series under FSG in 2004, and that team had some key players bought after FSG showed up (like Ortiz). Also, the Red Sox team that won the World Series in 2007 was stacked with star players bought after 2002 ( Beckett, Schilling, Lowell, Pedroia).

&gt;Also the 3rd championship was with a team that no one thought had any chance of winning anything. They didnt build the team to win a championship. The team rallied around the city after the marathon bombing and every player on that team played above what anyone could have predicted. That one isnt on ownership, thats on the players for coming together and playing out of their heads for a year. They deserve every ounce of credit for how they played but the ownership basically deserves none.   
  
Oh, come on. ""Boston Strong"" won the World Series and the guys who paid for the players, hired the GM, and hired the manager deserve no credit? The Red Sox had the 4th-highest payroll in the league in 2013, that team was built to be a contender.

I have 2x R9 290X's.  One is Powercolor and the other is Sapphire.  Both reference cards and have been in a Crossfire setup.  They're around 12 months old.  No mining, casual gaming only.

Looking for £190 each or can do a deal for the pair (plus postage on top).

To expand a bit: I fully see Son's strengths - we get someone with a lot of pace and a drive towards goal - and good finishing. That in itself is a huge plus.

Reasons I'm sceptical is that he's very much a head-down player, not one who during his run looks up to see whether Kane, Chadli or others are in a better position. That's a huge, huge minus for the way Spurs play, IMO. Also, he's quite weak physically, so I'm not sure how he deals with the PL in itself, but also the pressing game of Poch.

2 - the 8,000 jobs quoted is ALL jobs remotely related to Trident, I believe that ~350 are full-time faslane based jobs.

There's a lot of Americans who are contracted for Trident (mainly engineers), also the majority of the jobs quoted are based in England.

3 - This point only stands for the concern that Trident is based so close to Glasgow/Central-Belt, but there's an equally as big issue which is the *cost* of Trident especially during the age of austerity.

Just moving Trident to England/Wales wouldn't eliminate that issue (unless the Ruk decides to take on all the cost of running it, which just wont happen), the only way to remove the cost of Trident is to scrap it.

So it would still be a huge point of contest in any Independence Ref.

4 - Whilst *entirely* true, This would actually be a boost for the Pro-Indy side.

During the Ref 1 of the biggest sticks the Ruk kept beating the Pro-Indy side with was that Trident was 'almost' impossible to move as there wasn't any place to host it in England/Wales + the logistics + the cost, So if they moved it all of that argument goes out the window and the only thing left is the removal of Scottish financial contribution towards Trident &amp; that's the easiest part.",null,0,null,1441019723,null,null,false,0,culpa16,null,t3_3j2fy0,null,null,null,t1_culow84,null,null,null,1441603861,null,9,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

I really hope he gets major play time, but unless he hits the ground running, then he's likely to come off the bench if he plays at all. I'm guessing Markovic was a low-risk, low-wage loan signing to backup the players that Fenerbahce bought, and the 20 year old kid they're developing.

Yes, I do. If we were to win the league when we had Suarez... FSG would have received the credit for winning us the league. There will always be some team richer than us because we don't have pockets as deep as theirs.  

&gt;Not on the fact that there are 3 teams which are miles ahead of Liverpool financially, and a 4th that's significantly richer than Liverpool?

I agree that there are teams which are richer than us but eventually everything has to be shouldered by the owners whether they are wins or failures.

So far everyone's done a good job in explaining the general atmosphere towards our owners lately, which is overall pretty positive after saving us from administration and investing a lot of money into the club, but nobody seems to have explained that in comparison to our history/past success and our the general disappointments of the transfer market.

Like Fenway Park, Anfield is a very historic stadium. Instead of building a new stadium (which our previous owners had been promising for *years*), they pleased fans by announcing Anfield would be expanded from 45k seats to 54k seats midway through the 2016/17 season, with further plans to expand to 60k in total. This is something the club has needed for a long time as we've failed to keep up with the other clubs around us in terms of match day revenue. A bonus point was the promise that they wouldn't sell naming rights for the stadium.

Like Red Sox pre-FSG, we haven't won the Premier League (equivalent of World Series) for a long time, since the first division was changed to the ""Premier League"" in fact. We dominated England and Europe throughout the 70's and 80's, but slipped away in the 90's as our biggest rivals Manchester United rose to lift title after title. It's been 25 years now but we've come close, in fact the closest we came was two seasons ago under FSG, where we finished 2 points off of 1st place Manchester City, in case you don't know you pick up 3 points for a win and 1 point for a draw in league football, so we were one win away from the title. As you can imagine, there's even more positivity towards the owners for bringing us the closest we've been to winning the league in 25 years though a vocal minority have already forgotten about that and will instead focus on the disappointment of last season.

In terms of player ins-and-outs, when they first arrived we had a lot of players on high wages, and the first thing they did is offload them for cheaper alternatives. We've had mixed results so far but overall I would say fans are disappointed in our business in the transfer market over the past few years. After coming close to winning the title in 13/14, we lost our key player (Luis Suarez) to Barcelona, which fans were pretty much okay with after he had already given us a year longer than he would have wanted and a player of his quality deserves to play for the best team in the world alongside Messi and Neymar, most of us respect that. We got a club record £75m for him, spent ~£120m on 7 new players and while we knew we probably wouldn't challenge for the title again without a striker of Suarez's quality, the assumption was we'd improved our team overall and strongly increased the depth of our squad (which was very much needed as during 13/14 most of our substitutes were of low quality or youth players.) Unfortunately, it looks like most of this money was squandered on the wrong players. 

* Rickie Lambert (£4m) was bought as a plan B in all fairness, but never really suited us and has already been sold at the start of this season. He's a local lad and a Liverpool fan, so we were happy to have him here and see his passion even if he didn't make the impact he would've wanted.

* Adam Lallana (£25m) has failed to live up to expectations although he has been unlucky with injuries. 

* Emre Can (£10m) has been the best of the bunch by a long way and he will become a vital member of the team over the next few years. 

* Lazar Markovic (£20m) failed to impress and has just been loaned out to another club for the season as despite spending £20m on him, he isn't currently good enough to become a first team player at Liverpool. 

* Dejan Lovren (£20m) has been a fucking disaster, the player that was supposed to solve our defensive problems has worsened them significantly and despite a decent run of games at the start of the season, he made a couple of huge mistakes in our last match. 

* Alberto Moreno (£12m) not a bad purchase, but the young left back has been too unreliable in defence to keep his spot in the team, which has recently been taken by an 18 year old Joe Gomez playing out of his natural position. 

* Divock Origi (£10m) was immediately loaned back to Lyon for the duration of last season, and though he currently sits on the bench we haven't seen anything of him yet.

* The less said about Balotelli (£16m) the better, but we're unlikely to even be able to sell him he's been so bad. He'll probably be loaned out for the next couple of years until his contract runs out.

So yeah, they botched the transfer window big time, and that cost us a place in the top 4 of the Premier League which we need to be in to qualify for the Champions League, which you need to be in to attract top quality players.

This season our purchases have looked a little better, but only time will tell.

I didn't mean to write so much about our transfer window, but it's definitely the one area where fans are far from impressed with FSG and maybe you can see some similarities there between us and the Red Sox.

null,null,miomike,null,null,null,"You're not wrong. But you're also putting a little *too* much blame on us. The state of football is partly responsible right now too. The status quo between teams is ridiculous throughout various leagues, and within leagues. You're also ignoring the human aspect of the players. They see a chance to step up, get a pay rise, maybe more recognition, or win trophies etc, of course they'll want it.  

It's far, far rarer for a player to stay at a team now. I like the idea of loyalty, don't get me wrong. I also like the idea of a player deciding to stay somewhere for game time or his own development etc. Which.... might happen occasionally I guess. I like the idea of a young player coming out and saying ""I'm going to stay at Saints, where else would I get so much game time"" etc. But there's a reason players like Gerrard were club legends, and even he wanted to leave at one point. Lampard is a club legend who transferred from somewhere else, but even they aren't common (I'm mostly talking about status over a long playing career with one club here).     

If you personally were offered a promotion at what would likely be a good chunk more money (say another 25% at least for most clubs that buy our players right now. Probably as much as double for some though), would you not take it? We have contracts as staff in a business, but we can just hand in our notice and be off. Footballers can do that but they lose out on **a lot** of money. And with the limited shelf life of a footballer money is always a high priority for them.  

Not that I'm excusing the poor rich boys that get paid 3x my wage every week as needing more money, but you only consider your own situation when looking at things. I'm massively underpaid, but far, far better off than some, and I still threw up a ruckus when someone I trained got put on more money than me immediately. All relative and whatnot. The company I'm at would love to keep me, wanted to offer me a manager position and all sorts, but I said no because I'm off to do something that I want to do. Nothing they could do could keep me here. At least Saints have the option of making him stick to his contract, even if he'll be miserable. Just to assert their dominance.  

By selling everyone that has had interest shown in them, and repeatedly selling, we are indeed proving that any player has their price. But maybe eventually we'll be in a position to only sell 1 player. Keep the players we want to. Next season maybe only Mané and Wanyama will go, and we'll replace them and that'll be barely any upheaval. But there'll always be movement.  

And don't forget, we use this exact system to our benefit all the time. Forster, Wanyama, Tadic, Pelle, Mané. Rodriguez apparently kicked up a bit of a fuss when he found out we were interested (though I don't know for sure, might just be thinking of Ings from Bournemouth to Burnley).  

The problem we've got is exactly how much we've developed some players from practically nothing (or very little), or taken the risk on players that have proven themselves. These are players that a lot of people always thought might be bigger than us, and we as well as they knew we'd be a stepping stone. They aren't coming here for their career pinnacle. Someone like Pelle might think of us like that, late bloomer and such. Tadic... Maybe too. But someone like Wanyama, still only 24, has to be thinking of getting CL football again one day. Maybe Europa would have helped with that and he's throwing a hissy fit because we're not in it (though he definitely isn't devoid of blame there).  

Either way, the current state of football and human nature, in my mind, is what lets this happen, not just Saints. We're not devoid of blame, but not totally to blame either.

Yes. We would in the event that they had been used. When cities and people and entire civilisations had turned to ash, we would use them. It's vengeful and it's spiteful but if that's the only thing that keeps other people from using them, so be it.

&gt;I'm arguing we have no need for nuclear weapons with the expectation we can never use them.. 

MAD turns any victory from a nuclear first strike into a pyrrhic one at best or complete annihilation for the initiator at worst. What you're suggesting is that it's ok to be completely supine in the face of a greater force. History is written by the victors and no matter how much appeasement you generate, it will not be enough to prevent annihilation. Since time immemorial there have been genocides against entire races and tribes of people. We have a tool, one which has proven completely effective so far, to prevent that. If the insane and irrational get hold of nuclear weapons then all bets are off regardless of our own armament situation.

&gt;without losing our sanity and becoming the enemy. 

Are Americans the enemy because they used two nuclear devices on Japan? Are they insane? Or did they stop and realise that nuclear weapons are the greatest detterent known to humanity?

&gt;We should get rid of them for the risk that those who represent us might become that insane as to want to use them against another population.

The insane won't sieze control of Trident. The insane would never wish to use nuclear weapons first. You're supposing a logically flawed situation. We cannot put the genie back into the bottle.

&gt;Again.. since fallacies are not your strong suit.. 

Neither is your critical thinking based on facts but we all have our weaknesses.

&gt;I will point out that them over there are no different from us over here.

I think that's a crock of shit. We do not hold the same moral standards as Saudi Arabia, or Libya, or Algeria, or Pakistan, or any number of despotic hellholes around the world. Thankfully.

&gt;We should defend the interests of civilian populations everywhere, no just those people who live next door but also those who live down the road. Expecting that they might return the favour.

I agree. These are separate issues with regards to containing a hyperpower as well as questions surrounding moral authority over sovereign peoples.

&gt;The whole arguement in support of nukes, is fallacy.. perpetuated by those who are either naive; 

If you hadn't completely resorted to saying ""YOU'RE DUMB"" throughout your points I might have taken you seriously but you just come across as someone who doesn't know the first thing about international relations or real politik. Support your points with evidence. 

Have we had more or less frequent wars since the start of the cold war? Less! Points go to nuclear weapons.

How many large scale conventional wars have we had between super powers since the start of the cold war? None! Points go to nuclear weapons. 

How much money has been saved from not having to spend billions more each year on maintaining an enormous and wasteful standing army? Surely hundreds of billions, perhaps even trillions over the past 50 years. Money which has gone to improve the human condition in education, healthcare and other net positives. Points go to nuclear weapons.

&gt;or those who have a a vested interest.. power and wealth are strong motivators but they do not support what is in our better interests.

That's a problem with people, not with nuclear weapons. Exploitative proxy wars are still fought all over the world.

&gt;We need to be more human not less.

If all it costs us is £20 billion over 25 years to prevent the wasteful deaths of tens (or hundreds) of millions of people from total war, you should to rethink what price you put on a human life.

null,null,Alwaysfair,null,null,null,"&gt;George Osborne will unveil more than £500m of funding for the Royal Navy’s submarine base at Faslane in Scotland on Monday, promising that the money will secure 6,700 jobs and create thousands more.
The UK chancellor’s announcement will be seen as a further sign of commitment from the government to the full £23bn renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent.
But the Scottish National party, which has made unilateral nuclear disarmament central to its political platform, denounced the plan, pointing out that all but two of the 59 members of the UK parliament elected in Scotland in May oppose Trident renewal.
At the start of the last parliament, amid a wider austerity programme, the coalition briefly considered downgrading the policy that keeps a nuclear-armed submarine maintained at sea at all times.
Instead, it decided to maintain a full “continuous at-sea deterrent” involving four submarines.
The new Tory government is likewise preparing the ground for a big decision next year that will see ministers commit to four submarines, to be built by the 2030s.
Cutting their number to three — an idea that Labour recently considered — would put this principle at risk in the event of technical problems with the vessels.
Scottish and Welsh nationalists — as well as the Labour leadership frontrunner Jeremy Corbyn — have argued for the scrapping of the system, which takes up nearly 6 per cent of Britain’s overall defence budget.
Mr Osborne will say that the money will be spent over a decade from 2017 on large projects including ship lifts, sea walls and jetties.
Faslane, the largest military establishment in Scotland, will remain home to the Astute and Successor submarines and their crews until at least 2067, he will pledge.
The SNP reacted angrily to Mr Osborne’s plans. All 56 SNP MPs back unilateral nuclear disarmament and the sole Labour MP, Ian Murray, has made it clear he does not support replacing Trident.
Polls suggest widespread opposition in Scotland to a new generation of ballistic nuclear missiles. But the balance of public opinion that surveys report varies widely depending on how the question is phrased.
John Swinney, Scotland’s deputy first minister, said it was wrong for the UK government to press ahead with spending on new nuclear forces without a formal decision by parliament on the issue.
“The United Kingdom government should not be spending money in advance,” Mr Swinney told BBC radio’s Good Morning Scotland.
SNP rails against Osborne’s Faslane investment
Royal Navy welcomes third Astute Class sub to Clyde HMS Artful, the third of the British Royal Navyís new Astute Class attack submarines on arrival at her Scottish base port of HMNB Clyde, Faslane, Scotland, 19 August 2015 from where she will carry out sea trials before entering service later this year. The 7,400-tonne Artful left BAE Systems construction yard at Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria several days ago before sailing to her new home at Her Majestyís Naval Base (HMNB) Clyde. She will provide the Royal Navy with the most technologically advanced submarine Britain has ever sent to sea. HMNB Clyde will become a home for the Royal Navyís submarines and associated support by 2020, creating a submarine centre of specialisation. The base is amongst the largest single-site employers in Scotland, with 6,700 military and civilian personnel, increasing under current UK Government plans to 8,200 by 2022.
The Scottish National party has denounced the announcement of UK investment in the Faslane nuclear submarine base in Scotland.
The SNP also compared spending on nuclear weapons with UK government spending cuts affecting disabled welfare claimants.
“There is something fundamentally wrong with Westminster’s values and priorities if the chancellor thinks wasting billions on nuclear weapons is something to boast about when people are dying within our benefits system,” said Brendan O’Hara, the SNP’s Westminster spokesman on defence.
But the SNP has said it would welcome spending on conventional forces at Faslane, and Mr Swinney made clear that the party was not pushing for all spending on nuclear weapons to be redirected to social spending.
“If we make savings by not renewing the Trident nuclear missile system, that will enable us to use that money to invest in conventional forces,” he said.
Mr Osborne’s announcement follows the government promise in the June Budget to maintain the Nato commitment to spending at least 2 per cent of gross domestic product annually on defence.
Faslane, west of Glasgow, is one of three large naval hubs in Britain, along with Portsmouth and Devonport.
From 2020, it will become the Royal Navy’s “submarine centre of specialisation”, meaning that all underwater capability will be based there, including Successor submarines that are coming into service from 2028.
The site is expected to host about 8,200 jobs by 2022.
Mr Osborne, who is visiting the site, will say the spending commitment will secure thousands of jobs and provide “huge opportunities” for defence, security and technology companies.

If the market crashes, once the dust has settled, that risk of another big crash is reduced. There will be new borrowers entering the market who couldn't afford it before.

This is a risk to lenders, but also an opportunity they won't want to miss. Even if the market continues to fall, most of the new buyers will do everything they can to keep hold of the property they have just bought. In ten years time lenders might look pretty stupid if they missed out.

Additionally, WBA and Southampton seem incredibly less willing to deal their players than Corinthians and Zenit do, negotiation tactics aside. I think Pato and Witsel is much more attainable, but Berahino and Wanyama provide PL-proven quality in positions we know we need filled. Pato is going to be used up front but has been used on the wing recently in Brazil, and while Witsel I'm sure has the quality to be a good defensively responsible CM, he has never been used the way Wanyama has been and would be used used in a Poch style of play.

Saying “but the chances of a cop being killed in the US are only X times higher so they should only be X times as scared of getting shot” is a little bit disingenuous, because cops and pretty much everyone else don’t use stats when making split-second decisions. 

My theory is that there is a threshold. The UK is below this threshold - your average cop in the UK is not worried about dying in the line of duty. The US is above this threshold - cops in the US are actually worried and constantly think about the possibility of being shot and killed in the line of duty. I have no idea where this line is crossed, but I think that the US has crossed it and the UK hasn't.

So in the UK, cops worry that restraint (i.e. not shooting the suspect) will result in the perp *getting away*. In the US, cops worry that restraint will result in the perp *shooting them or someone else*.

It’s akin to terrorism - terrorism doesn’t kill *that* many people in the scheme of things, yet the West has spent a disproportionate amount of money and time and manpower “combatting” it. When people die, there is a threshold you can cross when a ""freak occurrence"" becomes ""something that happens"". When that happens, people understandably react more forcefully. And that's not anyone’s fault; it’s human nature / the desire for self-preservation.

EDIT: edited for clarity and to remove the ""5x statistic"" in order to avoid misleading people with my made-up stats.

It is not inconceivable to have serious grievances with the way the party was run in the past. I despise the Blairite administration. The way Blair would outright lie to the public, the way that Peter Mandelson and his army of spin doctors acted. Back then, I would have opposed Labour. 

Hell I remember back in 2006, I had a friend try to get me interested in politics and found myself unable to support anyone (I leant towards the Lib Dems as their stance on civil liberties was amazing - an area that Labour had an appalling record of at the time, though also felt that the Lib Dems at the time were rather green sky with their thinking which made it difficult for me to take them seriously). In 2010, I actually voted Lib Dem (in fairness, I was voting in a Tory safe seat which had Lib Dems in second place, so it's not like I contributed to Labour's defeat...).

It was only under Ed's administration that I started feeling ""Yeah, this is a party I could throw my loyal support behind"". Although Ed and his campaign was a complete and utter mess, his ideals were good. And when he resigned, I was afraid that Labour would lurch back to the old Blairite ways. So I joined so I could have a say in the leadership election (at the time, none of the candidates had been announced).

2007 yep all them, never said it wasnt. But do your homework because Pedroia wasnt ""bought"" he was drafted and developed through the farm system along with Papelbon, Lester, Ellsbury, and Buchholz.

2013. Haha what?! That had all intentions to be a bridge year. No one on the planet thought that team would do anything, they bought low on guys that no one wanted and literally hit on every single one of those guys, largely I believe because they all bought in, had a galvanizing event, and they all played out of their minds for a year. Like i said, the players deserve every ounce of credit. But if you truly believe a team that was ""built to be a contender"" then you are fully kidding yourself. Everyone thought Victorino was washed up so they got him on a short term deal and no one liked the way Napolis hip looked so it was the same thing, high money, short term= big payroll. And for having the highest ticket and beer prices in baseball if we didnt have a top end payroll people would be furious. They didnt even give Koji the closers role until they basically went through everyone else in the pen via injuries and failure. I didnt say ""boston strong"" won a championship, but that team having something to rally around certainly had a hell of a lot to do with them playing the way they did that year.

As far as your hired the manager, hired the gm thing.....well that manager has an overall losing record at the helm of the sox and thats with a wire to wire world series team mixed in, hes not very good at his job. Also, ownership was responsible for Bobby Valentine managing a Red Sox team so give them some credit for him too. The GM is now fired because he has been bad at his job and built last place teams far too often. Frankly I think he may have got the short end of the stick because the ownership group stuck their nose into baseball decisions and fucked things up, for example-Lester. We've been unable to properly judge Ben Cherington as a GM because we dont actually know what decisions he made vs. ones that were made above him.

They are meddling, they have no philosophy, they shamelessly try to milk every dollar out of the fanbase while simultaneously slapping us in the face (firing a beloved announcer with no explanation for days on end).

**Businesses with one or two shareholders**: Many of these businesses don't attempt to post large profits, but instead give out large dividend payouts.

I bought at the perfect time, in hindsight - after the bust of 2008 it took a while for prices to fall, and I caught them just as they hit rock bottom.

The question for me is, when's the best time to sell? If Corbyn becomes Labour leader on the back of promises of a People's QE (a lot of which would be spent on housing), would just the threat of him possibly coming to power have an effect on house prices?

574,000 x 1,032 / 100,000 x 26 = 227.8

You assume that the Age Specific Mortality Rate is a weekly rate. This assumption is wrong. It is an adjusted measure for total number of deaths per 100,000 people and does not account for time. You shouldn't multiply it by 26 because it's not a weekly figure.

This one wouldn't be a problem as dividends are considered paid out of profits and don't reduce the tax bill. From the [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/running-a-limited-company/taking-money-out-of-a-limited-company) article on it:
&gt;A dividend is a payment a company can make to shareholders if it has made enough profit.

&gt;You can’t count dividends as business costs when you work out your Corporation Tax. 

On the other hand:
&gt;Amazon: Keeps profits non-existent through continual expansion and treats its workers like maggots, but wouldn't fall foul of this tax.

Agreed that this one would be a problem, and is of course a problem that our tax system suffers all over. The fact that some large companies have found a way of cheating the tax system should necessarily cause us to give up on the tax system as a motivator altogether. It's just that that's a serious problem that needs solving in its own right.

It was within the lifetimes of people still with us today that the world was almost overrun by the Nazi's and the Japanese Imperial Empire. It only takes a small group of fanatics to severely disturb the world's international relations (let's remember that there are literally only a few small handfuls of people ""representing"" 7 billion of us and chances are many of them are Psychopaths, [if you relate a political leader to a CEO anyway](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyclay/2013/01/05/the-top-10-jobs-that-attract-psychopaths/)). 

People who want to scrap Trident seem to hold the mindset that it'll be alright because there'll always be someone else there to protect us (IE the US) but let's not forget our place in the world. Not many countries have Nuclear Weapons (generally for the better) but out of the small list that do China, Russia and North Korea are significant. It takes just one of them to completely change the world and the primary reason they haven't thus far is because of the small number of western states that can match their arms. To remove ourselves from the list would be ludicrous and, even though the chance of attack would still be small, it would not do us any favours in the eyes of the US nor the smaller countries in places such as Eastern Europe who in turn rely on us to keep the region stable through the existence of our nuclear deterrent. 

All in all I think it's absolutely worth a few quid of the taxpayer's money just to keep the peace of mind and not feel as though we're constantly exposed. Best case scenario and most likely one is we waste a few quid each and some CEO gets rich. Worst case scenario, and pretty much the only other scenario is the UK gets wiped out.

null,null,brokenairguitar,num7,,null,"&gt; West Ham and Everton are both trying to complete late swoops for out-of-favour Tottenham winger Aaron Lennon ahead of Tuesday's transfer deadline.  
&gt; 
&gt; The 28-year-old has no future at White Hart Lane after falling out-of-favour with manager Mauricio Pochettino.
&gt; 
&gt; Lennon made a strong impression during four months on loan at Goodison Park at the end of last season, scoring twice in a dozen starts, and Roberto Martinez remains interested in re-signing the Tottenham winger - while Hammers boss Slaven Bilic is also trying to complete a move for the Spurs outcast.  
&gt; 
&gt; The former England international is out of contract next year and he has not featured for Spurs this season with Pochettino making it clear he is not in his plans.
&gt; 
&gt; Lennon’s last appearance came in Everton colours against West Ham in May.
&gt; 
&gt; When Martinez signed winger Gerard Deulofeu from Barcelona in pre-season it seemed he had moved onto other targets, having been put off by Tottenham’s £9million asking price for a 28-year-old signed from Leeds a decade ago for just £1m. 
&gt; 
&gt; Everton were unwilling to meet Daniel Levy’s original demands but will attempt to revive a transfer.
&gt; 
&gt; West Ham have also shown interest in Lennon, but are closing in on a move to sign Chelsea winger Victor Moses.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The Nigeria international has been told he can leave Stamford Bridge after failing to make an impression on Jose Mourinho.

&gt;**You've never drunk alcohol. How did the team nights out go for you?**                              

&gt;I always wanted to head back as soon as possible. By 2am, at the latest, most of my teammates would be so drunk and the room so smoky, that nobody experienced anything any more. But the best thing in a team isn't the drinking, it's the everyday banter.

&gt;**For example?**                                                                                     

&gt;Once we were in our hotel rooms before an away game. Someone from the team was out on a pub crawl, sowe completely emptied his room. Removed everything, the bed, the TV, the cupboards, chairs, everything. He came back and thought he'd got lost and ended up at the wrong hotel.

&gt;**What was your favourite joke?**                                                                    
                                                                                                      
&gt;I used to love playing tricks with my teammates during finishing practice, making their shots look silly. First I'd take off the gloves, and then make saves with my head. That used to drive them crazy.   

&gt;**But at the same time you used to train obsessively. You were one of the footballers who hated holidays.**

&gt;Totally, the holidays drove me mad. I'd sit there and think ""this is shit, I'd much rather be training"". I'd take a book, read two pages, and put it away again.                                            
                                                                                                      
&gt;**What was that like for your family?**

&gt;They'd ask ""are you coming with us to the beach or in the water?"" and I'd just say ""No, why? I don't see any point"". A week's holiday was hard, two weeks was hell. Even if that doesn't sound romantic.. that's how it was for me.

&gt;**You were the first player to deliver messages of love to your wife on the pitch.**                 

&gt;Right, I started a trend there. There were lots of slushy messages in the newspapers, which I won't go into. So I wrote on my shirt ""I love my wife"". A few weeks later we played against Sheffield Wednesday and their goalkeeper revealed his shirt with ""I love Neville Southall's wife, too"" on it, which left me in stitches. 

&gt;**When you look back over the course of your career, what was your highlight? The two English league champioinships, the two FA Cup wins, the Cup Winners' Cup...**                                         

&gt;...for me the bigger thing is the frustration: we could have won much, much more. But right at our peak, UEFA banned English teams from European competition after the Heysel disaster.                     

&gt;**It seems like you're still mad at UEFA**                                                           

&gt;Let me put it this way, UEFA was very happy to sweep things under the carpet.                        
                                                                                                      
&gt;**What do you mean?**

&gt;I was coaching the Wales U-17 side, we had a game in Eastern Europe where one of our kids was called ""nigger"" by the opposition players. We reported it to the UEFA officials, but they just said ""We don't want any trouble"". At a youth tournament in Minsk we were on the same hotel floor as the referee. They had prostitutes coming to their rooms, the association knew nothing about it. But the officials didn't take Wales seriously, they only reacted when something related to the big teams. It's often that way in football, if you've got no money they've got you by the balls.

&gt;**These days you're working with kids and youths, what do you do exactly?**                          

&gt;I've worked for a long time for a project called NEET (""Not in Education, Employment, or Training). It's for kids who skipped school, quit school, or had no working future. We work with them in all areas of sport and try to give them some confidence and structure in their lives. Currently I'm working at a school with 12-16 year olds, we try to establish ties to companies that could offer apprenticeships.  

&gt;**What kind of advisor or teacher are you?**

&gt;Not the usual type. A student had problems with maths, so I started to play darts with him. That way he developed ability with multiplication. And obviously football is a key. In some ways it's better than school: it teaches you to deal with disappointment and mask out the voices from others. That's how it worked for me, why I spent the whole half-time break sat, unperturbed, against the post.

Reading the whole thing (I'd only seen excerpts) it seems now very bizarre that you're comparing death rates as you have been doing - are you actually suggesting that the deaths are somehow related to the benefits people are claiming?

The ""maths"" you've done supports the idea that the death rate is much higher in disability claimants than, for example, jobseekers claimants, but you'd expect that, surely?

Unless I've misunderstood something, it does seem that there's a fairly obvious explanation for the number of people being declared fit to work then dying within two weeks (and that's what the problem is, that the press is reporting on - that people who are so unwell they are dead within days are being declared fit to work). If you have an assessment for WCA, and you miss it, you are declared fit to work, until you file an appeal. If you are extremely unwell, you probably won't make your assessment.

His overall point was that war begets war, and that an act of terrorism isn't answered by the illegal military action of working a compound within a nation that hasn't given the go ahead for such an action, and simply shooting your target without public trial. 

Whether he deserved it or not didn't account for the fact that people who were victims in this haven't really been afforded answers or clarity. Instead it's just been a lot of whooping and cheering from a sizeable part of the population thinking that the jobs been done, when at that point it was more a loose thread in an already catastrophic unsettling of the middle east. 

What channel he appears on would likely be more to do with which one broadcasts him to the population of Iran, one he's been very open about opening up communications with. I don't think it's that controversial unless that was the topic he was being brought on to discuss. 

As for conspiracy theories, the details surrounding Bin Ladens death and sea burial seemed quite shrouded in secrecy, and not to sound like a tinfoil nut myself, but quite convenient. Considering the reasons for going to war were at the time, and still remain, to be highly contested, it's maybe not unfair to question why it's not really been open to independent verification that ""we got our man"".

The third way is *not* centrism. It is the belief that you can bring about socialist principles through capitalist economics. It has nothing to do with centralism. My personal perspective is that it was proved incorrect, but I'm happy to hear arguments... But this is not your argument.

You've totally failed to understand what I'm arguing. I calculated the expected deaths after 2 weeks of a ""fit to work"" decision assuming standard mortality rate for incapacity benefit claimants. I compared that with the actual figure.

&gt; . If you are extremely unwell, it's also quite likely you won't appeal against a ""fit to work"" result of that assessment. Isn't that a rather more plausible situation than that losing your benefits is causing people to suddenly drop dead within days?

You're aware that the only reason they go accross on a rickety barge is because EU countries have instituted a policy that means that failed asylum applicant will be deported to their country of origin at the expense of the airline that brought them. I don't know how much you've travelled, but I've seen it first hand - airline officials taking darker skinned people to one side and asking what their purpose of travelling to Europe is, even refusing them entry - whilst I, as a white Australian, am just waved through. Revoking this system would, in a flash, decimate the people smuggling industry, and provide a quick and easy way to return those deemed not to be refugees (since they'd have to board using their national passports) to their home countries.  It would probably work out cheaper in the short, medium, and long run than housing, benefits, or the absence of both and the social ills that followed.

&gt; Then we get to accept a few million culturally alien people into Europe and watch our big cities descend into crime-ridden ghettos.

This is racist. Literally racist. ""culturally different people swam in hordes to our cities and turn to crime"". No, if they turn to crime it's generally because they don't receive the state support that they should get to integrate. I also don't find them so culturally dissimilar, I've studied with people from all over the globe and we've all managed to get alone - generally far better with them than with xenophobes and bigots in my own country, who I *actually* consider culturally alien to myself.

&gt;There's no win-win solution here, you realize that right? I hope to God this is the issue that makes the European left finally grow up and accept that life simply isn't fair.

&gt; No, if they turn to crime it's generally because they don't receive the state support that they should get to integrate.

They don't want to integrate. A large proportion despise Western culture. Why should we let them live here and pay them benefits? Because of the Leftist guilt complex? I'll take a pass, thanks.

The problems of integration arise at the social scale, not in the one-on-one. You simply don't understand systems, scales, and emergent social effects if this is your argument.

null,null,GreenyLFC,lfc68,,null,"I'm not sure how buying/selling players works in Baseball (from what I've heard it's pretty similar), in Football the player signs a contract with the club lasting however many years and if the player wants to leave then a transfer fee has to be agreed between the two clubs for them to release the player from his contract. Some players have transfer clauses in their contract where if that fee is met then the club has to sell but otherwise it's down to the two clubs negotiating. That actually brings me to another positive point about FSG, they don't let our best players go cheaply. They refused to sell Suarez to Arsenal in 2013 even though they supposedly matched a £40m release clause that was in his contract (going on to say something like ""[what we've found is that contracts don't mean a lot in world football](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykJ4Rvko2cE)"" around 2 minutes into the video). And when Sterling kicked up a fuss to leave at the end of last season, they managed to squeeze a good £49m out of Man City after a long period of negotiation.

We've also seen a bit of a shift in the way players are brought in I think, when FSG very first came in they hired a Director of Football (Damien Comolli) on the suggestion of Billy Beane as somebody else pointed out (TIL), and he spent huge amounts of money on very mediocre players. After that we switched to a transfer committee, whereby the scouting process would go on as usual, but when it came to bringing a player in the committee had to agree with the deal. Typically in football it's the manager who decides what player he wants to bring in, though it is common in countries like Spain and Italy to have a Director of Football handle that stuff while the manager just focuses on coaching. I think this season Brendan Rodgers (our manager) has had more of a say in the players he wanted to come in based on the personnel brought in so far.

You mentioned three consecutive last-place finishes. How lenient have they been with your manager/coach in this period? With us they seem to have identified Brendan Rodgers as ""their guy"", he came in with a fairly low reputation and after finishing 7th, 2nd and 6th over the last three seasons they seem to be showing a lot of patience with him.

null,null,Putin-U-Down,null,null,null,"I'm a Rodgers supporter, I think he will come good with the players at his disposal. However, following the West Ham game I thought he made a large error in formation choice - why keep it the same as the Arsenal game considering West Ham are an entirely different team that set up very differently?

Furthermore that fact that we only had 1 shot on target the whole game is really worrying. With the likes of Benteke and Coutinho, you would expect so much more considering how we all know what both players are capable of in the league.

I'm actually willing to let the defensive issues slide for the game. In general we've actually looked quite solid and the emergence of a holding midfield player to give some protection has certainly added confidence to the 2 centre backs. One bad, bad day at the office doesn't change that. However if we get picked apart by Man United, and similar stupid mistakes are made I'd probably reassess this.

Optimistically speaking I do really think we will come good this season. Last season I didn't think that we would be very threatening, but this year, certainly I think Liverpool could and should score a shedload of goals whilst being able to keep it tight at the back. Once the offensive players get more time to line up alongside each other and get into sync, I'm certain Benteke will score. At the same time, I think a back 4 that stays stable and doesn't have much rotation would be really beneficial, and thankfully it seems Rodgers would agree with that.   

I really think Rodgers can deliver this season, whatever people think or say he was so so so important to that title challenging season in his set up and player management. But (and this is a big but) if the team is still not performing by Christmas (that means in and around the top 4, and playing very well) I really think the owners should look at possibly replacing the manager. If they don't replace him then, and don't get top 4 come the end of the season, I'd be very surprised if he kept his job.

As far as results go, I am fairly lenient. I genuinely believe that we are comfortably the fifth best team in the league and finishing in the top four would be punching above our weight. A lot of people will point to the money we've spent and say we should be doing better. I understand where they're coming from, but the way I see it Arsenal and Man Utd can go out there and spend £40m and get a world class player. When we spend £40m it is on two decent players. Some of the blame for that has to lie with the club for bad decisions in the transfer market, but part of the reason is out of their hands; top players just don't want to come here. So while we have spent a lot of money in the past few years, the fact that we're unable to get the same calibre players as the big four means we're always lagging behind.

What it would take for me to stop supporting BR. I said before that if Sakho and Lucas were sold this window I would find it hard to keep supporting him. So many factors go into something like the bad result against West Ham, but Sakho's exile and the under-appreciation of a player like Lucas is 100% on Brendan's shoulders, so I'm far more likely to outright blame him for something like that. I wouldn't like to put a marker down and say ""if we finish below 6th then Brendan should go"" because I think that's a little too simplistic, but if it comes to the end of the season and it feels like it did last season (just a complete write off of a year) then I think I would be calling for the sack. If we had a truly horrendous run of results mid-season I could probably be swayed too.

Basically I am supporting Rodgers at this moment in time, but he is on thin ice.

The worst thing about Rodgers as a manager are these constant false dawns he provides. We'll have a really good stretch followed by just the absolute pits where nothing works and everyone looks like shit. The pressure mounts and mounts and then he finds a way to get a decent win somewhere and people back off. Round and round we go and it always ends with us finishing 6th or 7th (13/14 was an aberration, sorry)...So in short even if he managed the club to a top 4 finish, his history shows the following season will be a massive letdown and failure. His job, when he was hired, was to show continuous improvement and sustainable building for the squad. He hasn't done that.

It'd be nice to get a better option, but it's just not in the cards, IMO.

Or, talk to Charlie Austin's people and ask if he'd like to play in another relegation-or-die season at Bournemouth (or was it Watford? Norwich?), or if he'd like to be option 1.5 (not first option, but not always on the bench, either) for Spurs.

But I'm starting to think we should keep our powder dry for January regarding a second striker/back-up striker option.

As for DM, if Wanyama and Witsel are out, what's left out there worth having?  Might be time to push all of our starting chips in on Dier (again, at least until January) and see what happens.

null,null,ivc09,lfc12,,null,"i still back Brendan, but West Ham severely dented the faith i had in him. It's not the conceding 3 goals thing, its the not creating a chance thing. We've scored 48 goals in the last 38, conceding 46. That goal scored record is disgraceful. Last season we didn't have a competent striker for 90% of the season, but even when Sturridge played in 2015, i dont think we scored more than 2.

Brendan Rodgers got the job because of his attacking principles and his fearless attitude to taking on teams. We scored a lot of goals in his first season, even more in the second. I need to see him let loose again, to bugger pragmatism and instead go balls out. We're always gonna concede goals, it happens to the best defences, but if you can't score goals whats the point. We bought Benteke, who's a competent striker, and yet West Ham happened. 

You save your job Brendan, by going back to what you do best. And that's setting up sides to attack other teams and to not worry about being pragmatic and being scared of conceding. When we played Arsenal in that 5-1, our back line was Flano, Skrtel, Kolo and Cissokho. With Gerrard, Hendo and Phil ahead of them.

I disagree with this claim, is he really for the average joe? He maybe popular with working class or young socialist, but outside of that he seems to lack any link. Its quite clear most of labour is out of touch with the average joe as the average joe voted for the conservatives.

What he needs to do is show evidence of improvement. He is a great manager if his ""Plan A"" works but it is way too predictable now and he doesn't learnt from his mistakes. I don't understand how fans and pundits from around the world can be so far ahead of BR in terms of the tactics he should be employing. A prime example of this was last year and the infamous Gerrard and Lucas CDM combo. To say it was a fucking disaster is an understatement - but BR persisted with it week after week after week whilst everyone was dying on the inside watching that debacle unfold before them. It appears the last person to realise that it wasn't working was BR.  

Similarly lining up against West Ham on the weekend - yes the players need to take a lot of the responsibility for that showing - but BR lined up wrong from the outset. It appears that again every man, woman and child knew exactly how the Hammers would line up - EXCEPT BR. Of course they would be defensive and narrow. Instead we lined up exactly the same as we did the week before to Arsenal away... There is no way Lucas should ever be starting that game, Coutinho and Firmino ""out wide"" where they both looked more lost than a penguin in the Sahara and then the backline was shambolic - Gomez was always going to struggle going forward and why Lovren is starting is entirely different argument by itself. After a woeful first half, the half time substitutions (and lack of) were baffling. With Benteke more isolated than Australia, Ings had to be on at HT - no ifs or buts - it was begging to be done, instead we take off Can and leave Lucas on. Admittedly Can wasn't having the best game but at least he is capable of threatening going forwards, whereas Lucas is nothing short of a liability in attack. Similar examples of sheer ineptitude can be seen in games like Villa in the FA cup last year - Can as a RB, what a fucking joke.  

So what does BR need to do to win me over? Utilise our best players to their strengths, don't be so predictable because his singular game plan has been exposed and show some degree of competence adjusting to his pre-game mistakes.  

Realistically, he can win me over by resigning, so we can recruit a moderately competent manager, because with a top manager there is no reason this side can't finish 2nd or 3rd with Man U/Arsenal/Chelsea all going to struggle this year but with BR I see a 4th place finish at best.

Possibly - according to the advert on the side of the bus in *Forest of the Night*. Certainly a show starring people who look like Capaldi and Coleman was being advertised.

No - The Doctor has visited another reality (ours?) on a couple of occasions, such as in the comics *The Girl Who Loved Doctor Who* and *TV Action* where he is surprised to find that he is a fictional character. There have also been a good many mentions of the in-universe show *Professor X*, which seems to fill much the same slot as Classic Who.

We have seen 0 minutes from Trippier for Spurs in meaningful games. Should he start? Maybe. Will he start? Maybe. Are they both good options? Almost certainly.

Tripper offers a good option too, I think, based on his Burnley cross-whipping days.

If your school has academic programs such as A levels or IB, it would definitely help. A levels is huge in the UK and is the main program that UK Students take. If you're not taking any of these programs, its best to consult your teachers or careers advisor. Also, it would be great to ask universities about academic qualifications for your country. So if you have a uni mind or have made a decision on what course you want take later on, it would help a lot.

It is likely that the university or the uk border agency will require evidence of english language proficiency e.g. taking IELTS. In some cases, they do need it although I'm not sure about your situation.

Many students even international, apply through UCAS. I'd say its pretty convenient. You can check they're website as there's a lot of info.

You should also check for any visa requirements or etc to enter and live in the U.K.

If you do apply later on, make your personal statement fantastic !

Also tuition fees for international students excluding accommodation fees is pretty expensive. In many cases, it's roughly double the price of the national tuition fee.

This was harder to determine, but using [this website](https://www.odmp.org/), I've calculated an average of 51.7 deaths per year from 2003 to 2013. The population of the US in 2013 was 316.5 million, so that's 1.63 x 10^-7 deaths per capita, or roughly 16.34 deaths per 100,000,000.

**The Result** 

By my calculations using the linked sources, ***the US has 23x more officers killed per capita in the line of duty by gunfire (being shot) than the UK***. This does not include officers accidentally killed with gunfire or officers who were off-duty.

So yes, not quite the 100x stat we are looking for in order for the number of civilians killed by officers in the US to be justified, but still quite damning and supportive of my underlying idea: response to death is not linear - there are thresholds and all sorts of factors that make the correlations all wonky and impossible to say ""this statistic should look like this because this one looks like this otherwise it's injustice"".

So I really don't think a new manager is going to be an instant fix or even any better than Rogers in the long term.

Money is a BIG factor in the Premier League and no matter how you look at it, we are already fighting from a tier lower than Man City, UTD and Chelsea in that regard - possibly even Arsenal included. It's going to take some smart business decisions over a long period of time, some luck (see 2013-14 - UTD, Chelsea going through management changes) or some unbelievable tactical master (which I don't even think exists) to get us into the top four let alone win the league.

I think the right business decisions are being made by the owners (developing the ground and trying to find those young, rough diamonds and the development of our youth setup.) and I also think Rogers is the right manager for the job because he's still young and he will progress also.

I really think the change he made for the Arsenal game showed signs of his maturing. It was effective and got us an important point away at Arsenal. 

Yet, the lack of change in the WH game proves that Brendan is still an incredibly young manager with a lot to learn.

null,null,onlyprogrammatic,null,null,null,"My first piece of advice would be to use your initial savings to put together an emergency fund of about 6 months of expenses (rent, bills, etc). You should keep this in a different account to both your savings account and ""spending money"" account. It's probably a good idea to put this in a regular savings account where you get some decent interest. Whatever you do, do not touch this money unless absolutely necessary. 

Second I would mirror what /u/edent said. If the company you work for offers a pension scheme then start contributing! They will match your contribution up to a certain %, which = free money for you. The amount of people at my work who don't do this and have already missed out on £1,000s is ridiculous. 

Third, as you're new to the investing / personal finance game I would strongly suggest investing in some books on the subject in order to broaden your knowledge. There is already a [recommended reading list](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/wiki/recommendedreading) put together by members of this sub. I am ready the intelligent investor at the moment and it is a fantastic book.

Fourth, now you're ready to invest. From you're post it seems like you mostly want to save for a deposit on a house so you have a few options. 

1. You can look into the help to buy ISA.
1. You can put your extra money into a regular savings account as the interest on these is really good at the moment and you will likely need the money in the short term.
1. 50/50 split between putting money into a regular saver and opening up an S&amp;S ISA to start investing for retirement.

I am by no means an expert but this should help you get started. Let me know if you have any questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpiZw1R8w-c

Long story short:

- Yeltsin was corrupt from the start, the newly minted Russian oligarchs had funded his campaign.

- By the late 90's Yeltsin was in failing health, and members of his inner-circle were controlling the Kremlin, dubbed by the Russian press as ""the Family"", Abramovich was an influential member, one of the first to suggest Putin, an unknown lowly FSB Lieutenant (iirc) as Yeltsin's successor.

- Now the rip off: there are so many cases that it would take a day to just list them. The big notable ones were the Mabetex scandal, where Billions of tax dollars were spent in renovating the Kremlin, most of this money was ridiculously over-quoted ($350 Million for Interior-Decoration) and Mabetex, a swiss company, was used as a vehicle to stuff billions of dollars in Swiss banks. 

- Roman was too smart and always used front-men to be implicated. However Yeltsin's family wasn't so smart, they found swiss accounts in the actual names of Yeltsin's daughters and the Kremlin property manager.

- When the Russian Prosecutor General went after this, he was invited to the Kremlin and shown hidden camera footage of a man that looked like him having a threesome with 2 women. (I kid you not). 

- Prosecutor didn't back down, the Family leaked the footage, to which the Prosecutor responded it wasn't him and upped the ante by going questioning Yeltsin's daughter and arresting Berezovsky (spelling?) who was the other big oligarch in the Family, he had accumulated his wealth via monopolizing State Media resources, rather than state natural resources like Roman.   

- Up steps Roman's trump card: Vladimir Putin, director of the FSB (kinda like Russia's FBI) publicly confirms after ""professional analysis"" of the grainy footage, that that man is the General Prosecutor. This is later used to oust the Parliament-chosen Prime Minister and get Putin (who was a really really shit statesman with no popularity) elected as PM. Yeltsin resigns, Putin becomes President and promptly issues an order of immunity for Boris and family. While Roman, Berezovsky and Tatiana Yeltsin pulling the strings all long. Roman was the shadowiest of the three since not being media tycoon (Berezovsky) or Yeltsin's daughter, he escaped media attention. Little did they know at the time that Putin had his own plans and was not going to be anyone's puppet for long. 

- Roman was however actually arrested much earlier in 1992 for theft of 50 tankers of state owned Diesel, which he rerouted to another buyer with fake paperwork. The charges were dropped when the final buyer agreed to pay the cost price of the stolen quantity (after making an incredible profit by selling it on the open market). 

Lots and lots more...if anyone accuses you of anti-chelsea bias, just show them this article from 1999 (pre-Chelsea purchase) by the Times who had just figured out who this shadowy figure was by connecting him to a 15 Billion dollar laundering scheme:

They also taught us how to hate aspects of our own dear club.

For some, this hate continued and is now expressed as a militant distrust and anger at anything and everything the club does. Every choice is questioned. Every mistake is held up and crucified. Every little thing down to our choice of tea lady is analysed and scrutinised as if it is single most important decision the club has ever made.

A S&amp;S ISA is an account that you open with a bank or a broker. Then when you deposit money, you choose which investments you want that money to be spent on, and then those investments are held in the account.

An index fund is a collection of shares in some representative sample of companies (to match the index), which are held by a fund manager. You can then put money into their pot (to be invested in the same proportion), and receive shares in the fund in exchange - when the underlying companies do well the index fund increases in value and so does your share of it.

End of the day if Sturridge had been fit and scoring like we know he can all season last year we probably would have got top 4. Season before that they almost won it. I don't see any reason why the group of players at the club now couldn't get top 4, they're a really talented group.  

The reason Christmas is a deadline is because it's the half way point to a season. Any less time than that isn't a fair crack of the whip, and any more could be harmful to the club if they weren't performing. Not to mention a new manager having the winter transfer window to use.

Personally, and I'm sure it'll vary between fans and the owners I would think Rodgers would have to be at worst, 5th/6th place but very close to 4th for me to still have assurances in him. 

Stability is so important to any club so I'm really hoping he'll be here for the whole season, and without a doubt he has the tools to be a success this year. Just hope that he uses them correctly.

&gt; [...] he suggested the assassination of the mastermind behind the September 11 attacks would result in deeper unrest.

&gt;___The Last Day___ was a mini episode released on [20 November](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/20_November_(releases\)) [2013](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/2013_(releases\)) as part of the run-up to [the 50th anniversary special](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Doctor_(TV_story\)). It gave viewers a look into the [Last Great Time War](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Last_Great_Time_War) from the perspective of a [Gallifreyan](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Gallifreyan) soldier, and showed the beginning volleys of the [Fall of Arcadia](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Fall_of_Arcadia), one of the final battles that happened right before [the Doctor](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Doctor) ended the Time War. As of May 2014 [[update]](https://tardis.wikia.comhttp://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_Day_(TV_story\)?action=edit), it is the only televised story set exclusively in the era of the [War Doctor](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/War_Doctor), though he does not make an appearance.

Lovren and Skrtel kept 3 clean sheets but 1 was against a Stoke team that was pretty poor, an Arsenal game in which we literally threw 10 players in the box (and should've conceded) and Bournemouth who had a goal wrongly chaulked off.

It's simple meritocracy. Lovren played badly last game. We have a good enough replacement. So replace him. There is no way anyone can say that Rodgers should continually pick Lovren. The same way that Rodgers spent half a season continually playing Gerrard and Johnson despite them putting in some diabolical performances. He has to be dropped. What do you think is going through Sakho's mind? It sounds amateurish to say but if Sakho committed the same mistake, I have no doubt Rodgers would bemoan him. It took Rodgers half a season to figure out how badly Lovren was doing this season.

I really hope Rodgers figures this out because this is his final straw and if he gets it wrong, it won't be his coaching staff that will be gone but him, and his 1 in a million chance to manage a club the size of Liverpool. He cannot keep picking players who simply do not deserve the spot. I can't even imagine what Lovren is feeling right now - He's had a torrent of disgusting abuse aimed at him.

When he's playing well, Fabregas' defensive contribution is pretty good. Works harder than you think, makes clutch interceptions etc.
Of course, when he isn't playing well, his defensive contribution is practically non-existent.

Regarding the potential tactical changes:

If you think about it, the system we play is actually pretty damn rare.

Most teams use their full-backs offensively. The average FB is virtually an auxiliary winger, even in the more defensive sides like Sevilla and Atletico. Whilst Ivanovic may fancy himself going forward, he certainly doesn't possess the requisite attacking prowess.

The main job of our full-backs has been to 'sit'. Hence why a natural CB is played at RB, and a natural RB at LB. It worked brilliantly well for large parts of last season, having an extra aerial threat made for so many more goals. Cahill/Terry/Ivanovic scored what? 15 goals?

I've always thought that because of this somewhat reserved tactic, a player who is naturally a 10 is required to play a position that would usually be occupied by 'Jack of all trades' type box-to-box player.

I think the reason we always seemed to play terribly when Cesc was in the 10 last season, despite it being his supposed best position, is that in this system, a player with his vision/passing range from deep is an absolute necessity, at least if you want to have any chance of breaking down the opposition.

I believe that if Dave and Baba were played, then Ramires/RLC in the pivot would work, but with the 'sitting defense', a genuine B2B player doesn't fit the system, unless of course, we are parking the bus.

The role of offensive full-backs is absolutely huge in freeing up space in the middle. Think Alba/Alves, Coke/Tremoulinas etc.

Moving Dave to the right does however mean that JT would no longer have the protection he needs, so a Cahill-Zouma partnership is likely. This would bring about the potentiality of high line though, as they're both quick. With more offensive-minded full-backs, a high line allows them to contribute more to the attack.

TL;DR In my opinion, playing a completely different player to Cesc has implications that aren't immediately thought of.",null,0,null,1441036242,null,null,false,0,culx2hp,null,t3_3ixx7t,null,null,null,t3_3ixx7t,null,null,null,1441607597,null,2,null,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2,null

Anyways she was very attractive, slim, petite, cute and a hot body. She hit on me and we started talking. Her parents were going away for the weekend so naturally I ended up going to her place for sexy times. 

Turns out she and her family were United fans. Scarves and posters on the walls everywhere. So we're in her bedroom, undressing and foreplaying. Not only is she fucking amazing looking, she also wants me to handcuff her to the bed and do what I want to her. I cannot believe my luck. 

I take the fuzzy handcuffs and cuff her to the bed. She is on her back, spreads her legs and begs me to go ahead. That's when I saw it. A poster on the wall behind the bed of Cristiano Ronaldo in a United shirt staring at me. Staring into my soul.

I feel the gaze of his eyes on my naked body. I feel disgust. I go soft. Just can't keep it up. Tried looking away but still see his face. She wonders what's wrong. I feel the anxiety burning within me. Lust is gone. I tell her I don't feel well, uncuff her, put my clothes on and I leave. She would have been my first. Now she laughed at me and told me to fuck off.

Go home, lie down, try not to cry out of disappointment. Cry a lot. United ruined my chance, my self esteem around women for years to come and delayed the start to my sex life for a few years. I felt I let myself down, I let her down and somehow I also felt I let LFC down.

tl;dr: I let Ronaldo and United ruin sex.

But I don't think he's earned a seat on the bench for it.  Someone has to be the worst in the starting side, but it doesn't mean he's not the best FB on the right.

Who would you say is likely to perform more poorly over the longterm than Walker?

Certainly not Rose, Vert, Toby, Lloris, Eriksen, or Kane.

Probably not Masentaleb, Chadli or Son.

That leaves Dier.

So if Dier's performance yesterday was not typical of what could be expected (too small a sample to say for certain), then Walker isn't the long-term weakest player on the starting side, only the second-weakest.

Just started rooting for LFC beginning of last year after picking up interest in the sport as a whole from the World Cup. I chose Liverpool because I like the YNWA mentality, and after reading up on the various histories of different clubs, I decided to roll with the Reds.

Obviously take my opinion with a grain of salt, but my main confession here is that I feel the team isn't ""exciting"" to watch. Maybe it's from two years of changes with new players who didn't mesh, like Balo, etc. When Arsenal hit their stride last year they were making no-look passes and playing really seamlessly from what I could tell. I've seen nothing of that ""clicking"" happening at Liverpool. Our attack seems ""clunky"" compared to some of these other teams. Is it just me? I don't expect these new players to just instantly become some ultra-squad, but last year even after a whole season working together they just looked ""meh"".

It also seems like sometimes our players don't play with a sense of urgency.

null,null,uknowSawyer,null,null,null,"I understand a lot of people are frustrated at this transfer window, but to be completely honest another signing isn't necessary at this point and it won't change too much in itself.


Our main issue is that basically none of our key players from last season is playing well. Hazard, Costa, Matic, Fabregas, Terry - all very essentiel to our league title last season, all in very bad form and spirit this one. If Mourinho manages to make the team look hungry again and work as a unit I believe we are stronger than we were last season with the addition of Pedro on the right side which was our main problem last season.



People are really exaggurating about all the transfers we need at this point. Sure, a world class player would always be nice and would always improve any squad in the world. But it's not a necessity as people make it out to be. As far as I can recall we shipped off Petr Cech, Filipe Luis, Cuadrado (on loan) and Drogba from last seasons squad and replaced each player in their respective role with Begovic, Baba, Pedro and Falcao. On top of that we also added Kenedy and Traoré to our squad.

Cech was a big blow but Begovic has already proved that he's the best possible replacement for a backup keeper when he stepped up immensely when we needed him to.

Baba is a great prospect with lots of years in the first team ahead of him.

Pedro instead of Cuadrado doesn't need much words, everyone knows how huge an upgrade it has been already and that is while most of his teammates around him straight up suck. Just imagine how he'll be like when we get the rest of our key players going again.

Drogba was not the best for us last season, he didn't look like he fit the team too well but he still scored a lot of goals all things considered and whether or not Falcao will be an improvement or not only time will tell. Out of all 3 strikers so far I think Falcao is looking the best (which is saying more about Costa than it does Falcao tbh).

Traoré has yet to get a chance outside of preseason but we know how great of a player he can be for us in the future.

Kenedy already got his debut against Palace and he looked really, really promising especially considering the fact that he was put in as a left-back despite being an attacking player. This is the one I'm looking the most forward to in this season, hopefully he will get a lot of gametime now that the rest of the team is out of form and hopefully he will flourish and be a real contender for the starting spots sooner rather than later.",null,0,null,1441037733,null,null,false,0,culy0cq,null,t3_3j3343,null,null,null,t3_3j3343,null,null,null,1441608040,null,18,null,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,18,null

Given Rodgers' apparent total control over all aspects of the squad the buck stops with him on this. If we're consistently creating tons of chances but their keepers have worldies while they score from a deflected set piece on their only shot of the game, that's fine.

He's pro immigration. Again, not because of emotion or ideals but because he feels it's the best way to keep and grow our economy.

That's literally his only strength. He's fucking great going forward. If you don't even know that much about our own players, I have to question your knowledge of the club.  

Sure, he's worse than Gomez defensively, but when we're down 2-0 and playing with a LB that is literally killing your offense, then you need to make a change. Gomez alone wasted so many possessions and completely ruined any attempt at width. Every time he received the ball on the Wing he'd be incapable of taking it further down the pitch for a cross. Instead he tried to pull into the middle (right footed) which simply resulted in an additional defender for our attacking players to deal with. 

He couldn't even recycle the possession successfully. 

West Ham were parking the bus after the 2nd goal, and we needed more offence not more defence. You can even swap out Lovren for Moreno, and let Gomez play the CB role he's actually good at. 

&gt; I doubt him coming on would have meant us scoring, as seen in the second half when we failed to score with him on.

That's because Rodgers went full retard and took of Can instead of Gomez. Completely ridiculous decision.

He was also far too late at bringing on Ings. Overall poor adjustments that were made far too late.

From there, it was another 12 appearances before he scored for Liverpool. The aforementioned strikers hit the ground running and didn't stop scoring, really, until they left. Suarez is the small exception, only scoring 4 times in 13 EPL appearances in his first year.

Sicialian and Venetian are very different, including to each other. To the point where, if two guys in my office are speaking to each in Italian, they'll have to switch to English to figure out what this word meant, or what this sentence structure was etc. They both try their best to speak 'generic' Italian, but sometimes the Sicilian can't help it. The languages are hugely different,and there's no guarantee of actually understanding them.

I get that going from expecting to get Stones or Laporte and ending up with a lesser player like Djilobodji is a massive blow. But until you and I and the rest of the people already talking shit about the transfer actually watches him play, I don't think it's fair to say the shit that gets said on this subreddit.


The point of the transfer is not to make him a starter like Stones or Laporte, not now, not in the future. The point is simply to add squad depth that everyone has been complaining about. Worst case scenario he's as bad as people who havn't watched him makes him out to be; unlucky. But then again, we got him really cheap and will most likely be able to ship him off again when we no longer need the squad depth.


The only thing this transfer does is allow us to not massively overspend on a defender in this current window. 6 months from now we can try again, if we still can't find the right player for the right kind of money, we'll just have to wait another 6 months.

1. he was a relatively unknown good. he has shot up to prominence since then and players/teams are trying their best to mark him out of games. until firmino, beneteke, ibe, hendo, milner, can, etc can take some of the responsibility off of his shoulders, couts will be less effective because they can effective mark him out of games without worrying about other threats as much.  

2. i think someone mentioned it above, but couts was playing much deeper than he is now. the game against arsenal comes to mind, he was essentially playing off of benteke and was expected to produce far more scoring threat than passing threat. 

3. we still are adjusting (again) to a brand new system with new players. we got out of a pretty difficult start to the season with 7 points out of 12, which is par for the course against everyone important bar city. 
 
4. i think maybe the most important piece to all of this is coutinho's adaptation to being ""the guy"" this is a big year for him as a player but also as a leader/man. he'll cope well and get on with it.

China is being more in its foreign policy than at any time since its failed invasion Vietnam. Russia is definitely more aggressive than any time since Afghanistan. The fact that they're acting the same way great powers have always acted is exactly the worrying thing, because it means they no longer consider the US-NATO axis as unassailable as they did in the '90s and '00s.

The crisis may be over, but we are definitely still seeing the effects; Europe and America are so obsessed with financial stability that they are cutting everything, including military budgets in most nations that aren't next to Russia (something that points to more tension with Russia than usual, not less).

null,null,ny-batteri,null,null,null,"&gt;Sicialian is a lot like Venetian, in your example you used Neapolitan which half the country speaks, and is a lot closer to the generic ""Italian"". Sicialian and Venetian are very different, including to each other.

Want to have another go at that? Is Sicilian a lot like Venetian, or very different?

Neapolitan is not spoken by half the country, only in Campania. The 'generic' Italian standard is from the Tuscan dialect, and every Italian learns it at school, hears it on the radio, watches it on TV, reads it in the newspapers, speaks it on business etc, in announcements at train stations. 

You could understand the article, sure. You speak a language that's pretty closely related to Ulster Scots, with dialects, pronounciation and accents that have influenced the development of each other. Someone from a different area who nevertheless spoke fluent Standard English would struggle a lot more. 

Further, a lot of words in there you'll only have understood from their context in the sentence. Others you'll have noticed are very similar to the spelling of your native English. These situations are entirely analogous to the situations that a native Castillian Spanish speaker, or Standard French, would be faced with when reading Catalan, for example. Likewise for someone from Copenhagen reading Swedish or Malmo reading Danish.

One is the assumption that a 20% drop is the worst-case scenario.  What's currently driving London property is a bit of a mystery, if that stopped, it would stop for a reason; then what would drive it?  Recessions have bizarrely helped London property over the past twenty years.

Indeed over the past twenty years it's the ""studio with a bed next to the washing machine"" (to quote one of the other commenters here) that have accumulated the most.  It's not a massive leap-of-faith to think that such entry-level property would fall the most should there ever be a sustained decline in house prices.  Even if the average drop was 20%, it would be people who'd stretched the most to get on the bottom of the ladder who'd lose out the most.

Secondly, there's the what's-the-point factor.  If a £300,000 studio with a bed next to the washing machine is your lot in life, what's the point?  I'm not advocating mass-suicide, but rather why bother with standard full-time work?  There's evidence this is already a factor, and is why London's economy is either very well paid, or very badly paid (but still attracts enough 23-year-olds to employ as people are attracted in the short-term for the lifestyle).  Most middle-professions struggle to recruit, usually because the people in those professions have withdrawn themselves from the market to freelance and/or start a business somewhere cheaper.

""Just buy"", yeah, if you want to spend the rest of your life in a studio flat in a block where all the other flats are rented out to randoms constantly changing every six months.

null,null,Everton_11,crest,The Lukaku Strikes Back,null,"Ross really isn't a ""playmaker"" in the traditional sense. While he usually plays in the physical location on the pitch as a traditional playmaker, his playing style is significantly different.

Ross is a very direct player, who likes to take the ball, run at players, dribble past them, and shoot, and he can be very good at it. This play style runs into difficulty against teams that defend with ten men and don't care if they only get a draw in a game.

Against a team that sits back and has a well-organized defense, the only way to score, other than with a moment of magic, which can never be counted upon, is by passing the ball through the defense. Ross isn't very good at that. He's improved, but he's not really suited for the role.

What we need is someone like Fabregas at Chelsea, Ozil at Arsenal, or Iniesta at Barcelona who has a good passing range and an eye to spot forwards and wingers making runs in behind the defense.

Should we obtain said player, he would most likely play in the center, behind Lukaku, and Ross would be either shifted out to the wing (which most of us here don't like the idea of), or be played deeper, slightly ahead of either Barry or McCarthy in a ""box-to-box"" midfield role, where he generally plays the same game, charging at opponents and shooting, but starts from deeper and sees more of the ball.",null,0,null,1441039645,null,null,false,0,culz980,null,t3_3j3o6u,null,null,null,t3_3j3o6u,null,null,null,1441608627,null,22,null,Everton,t5_2qpfg,22,null

When all roads led to Stradey Park with the All Blacks here again,

they poured down from the valleys, they came from far and wide,

There were 50,000 in the ground and me and Dai outside.

-

The shops were closed like Sunday and the streets were silent still,

And those who chose to stay away were either dead or ill,

But those who went to Stradey park will remember till they die,

How New Zealand Were defeated and how the pubs ran dry.

-

Oh the beer flowed at Stradey, piped down from Felinfoel,

And the hands that held the glasses high were strong from steel and coal,

the air was filled with singing and I heard a grown man cry,

Not because we'd won but because the pubs ran dry.

-

Then dawned the morning after, on empty factories,

For we were still at Stradey, bloodshot absentees,

But we all had doctors papers and they all said just the same,

that we all had Scarlet fever and we caught it at the game.

-

Now all the little babies in Llanelli from now on,

Will be Christened Roy or Carwyn, Derek, Delme, Phil or John,

And in a hundred years from now they'll sing a song for me,

About that day the scoreboard read Llanelli 9- Seland Newydd 3.

-

And when I grow old, my hair turns grey and they put me in a chair,

I'll tell my great grandchildren that their Datcu was there.

And they'll ask to hear the story of that dark October day,

Spurs had Bale and not much else and they could barely make top 4, an I think bale was almost to Suarez's level, if not just as good.

Also, I think you not only discount the manager's part in all of it, but also the rest of the team. Suarez made it much easier, but Suarez alone won't do it. You need the personnel to play alongside and complement him perfectly, which we had in Sturridge, Gerrard, Coutinho, Henderson, and Sterling. You also need a manager who can put all these players where they need to be (some of them seemingly out of position also, Coutinho as an 8 and Sterling as a 10 were 13-14 versions of Markovic at WB that everyone loves to make fun of) as well as a manager who can motivate the players and get them all playing well at the same time. You see time and again the players defending Rodgers, saying they'd run through a brick wall for him, and saying they'd have won countless trophies if he'd been there for 10 years instead of 2. Tactically sound, creative, and motivational managers don't just grow on trees.

All that being said, he needs to start getting results, and fast. I think his days are numbered without significant improvement, because Klopp won't be available forever.

It's not bullshit. It's perfectly analagous. People in Malmo speak standard Swedish, yes. But their regional dialect and accents make it a lot easier to understand Danish, just as yours will make it easier for you to understand Ulster Scots than would someone from New York. 

&gt;Edit2: Catalan is literally nothing like French. I'd quicker mistake it for Spanish, and there are notable differences between Cataland, Basque and Spanish. (I got a nice wee drunken lecture from a catalan woman I work with)

All that proves is that you are not a linguist. Catalan is closest to the Occitan language in the South of France (again, try telling them that their language doesn't exist because people who speak Catalan or standard French can understand it), and that's not debateable - linguists have painstakingly checked the phenomes and cognates and that's where its closest. 

Catalan does indeed superficially resemble Spanish, but it actually has many more false cognates (you might remember these as 'false friends' from French in school) with Castillian than it does standard French. 

'Notable differences' between Basque and Catalan/Spanish is something of an understatement.

null,null,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,null,"Negative equity is the killer. 

Lets say I buy a house for £100,000 and I've put in a £10,000 deposit. So I got a mortgage for £90,000 with a loan to value of 90%. I borrowed 90%, and I paid 10%. 

Now, if that house then loses 25% of its value, the loan to value sky rockets. 

It'd go from 90% before, to approximately 105%. 

Most people think this isn't really a problem, because you bought a house to live in so you just live in it, right? Well not really. 

When it comes time to remortgage it'll be almost impossible to find a new deal as 105% mortgages as near as matter don't exist any more. 

So you'd be stuck on your after offer mortgage deal which is generally x% + base rate. 

So when your mortgage deal runs out, and you can't find another then you're completely at the mercy of your bank and the base rate. Every time the base rate goes up so does your mortgage payment, that's less money in your bank account each month. 

That's why people fear negative equity so much. 

Then take into account that there's approximately 500,000 house sales every year, and a 25% crash would reset us back by about 6 or 7 years. Well, yeah. There'd be a hell of a lot of people in this situation and they'd be tightening their belts. 

Tightening belts is not good for the economy. 

Also, you'll only be able to pick up repossessions as banks routinely do not even let people sell their property if they're in negative equity. So you'd literally be feeding off of someone else misery. And they were once people like you.. Just happy to get on the ladder.

We basically relied on 18 players last season to win us the title and it was clear they were pretty spent by around March/April. Looking at our midfield particularly, we had no one who can play a role similar to Fabregas, which means if he's out or off his game, we lose a certain type of tactics. We do have youth who can step into these roles, but I'd prefer to not have all our depth rely on players who have had &lt;10 EPL starts.

World class players would have been nice, but I think depth was/is more important. Instead we just ended up going one in one out, which basically leaves us with the same squad as last season, except everyone is a year older.

I don't believe popularity =  greatness, like this guy is suggesting.   

Twilight is popular but everyone knows it doesn't belong on the pantheon of works of literary genius. Same with Harry Potter.   

And so what?   

Yes, great books shape the way you view the world and all that, but that doesn't mean you must only read the ""greats.""  

It's like someone saying everything on television is shit, so everything must be like BBC Four.  

Is BBC Four good? Yeah. But TV would be boring as fuck if every single thing shown *had* to be as stimulating and ""intellectual"" as a BBC Four documentary.  

I don't know what this guy's problem is.   

And who does he recommend? Bukowski.  

An author that pretty much every book lover and lover of reading has read.  

Have you read Marquez's ""One Hundred Years of Solitude""? Is it brilliant? Yes. But fucking hell, look at that prose and style. If every novel was written like that I wouldn't read.  

&gt; By dissolving the difference between serious and light reading, our culture is justifying mental laziness and robbing readers of the true delights of ambitious fiction.

That way, you would save a lot of interest, and it would go some way towards making up for the drop in the property value.

True story: I bought in 1990, just as that bubble was bursting. The value of my little flat crashed 60% (i.e. if I sold it was worth 40% of what I paid for it). I started overpaying the mortgage and by 1998 had cleared it. I then rented it out and bought another property.

Property prices then rose and I sold the flat for a profit on my original purchase value, plus I'd made a little on the rent. And of course the second property was bought at the perfect time.

The key is to have as little debt as possible: it gives you options.

None of those apprenticeships require anything like 12 months of training, and most importantly, especially on the customer services ones, they're not going to teach you anything transferrable.

But this is par for the course for the hard-left.  They find it easy to criticize the West for everything and anything, whilst bending over backwards to avoid condemning terrorism.  Because, let's be honest - people on the hard-left tend to view terrorism as a natural blow-back against the evil oppression of the imperialist West.

And fair enough if you agree with Corbyn - but I think this video fits entirely into a pattern in which he constantly equivocates when it comes to topics like Islamism, or terrorism.  

BTW - I fully understand that this politely worded comment will be downvoted by the Corbynistas, who are unable to allow any criticism.

I think the other thing you need to get your head around is the fact that none of these terms has a real fixed or universal definition. They are relative at best, not just to each other but also within each other. 

Democratic socialism need not be specifically concerned with bringing about ""pure"" socialism, and I think that in reality you'd be just as hard pressed to find anyone who actually advocates that as anyone who might actually advocate ""pure"" capitalism. Worker control of the means of production through democratic means is any case a bit of an oxymoron, given that democracy is inherently about delegating and dispersing control. But I think we are both in agreement TB doesn't support that -- only the far left really do. 

Similarly, going by the Wikipedia page on Third Way, it is pretty obvious that it is a kind of centrism. The whole point of both is bringing together and borrowing what is functional from either the right or left in order to achieve certain aims. See also [here,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blairism#Ideology) on Blairisim if you still aren't so clear on it.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

To restate my argument in skeleton (none of which have really be answered; you've just picked up on terminology in your last post, but are again missing the bigger picture):

* Inequality is more complex than you make out; it is not the result of any one policy or government. Thinking government have this much [control](https://ideas.repec.org/p/rut/rutres/200213.html) over Western societies is ridiculous. This is especially true in the context of globalisation. 

* Getting worked up about Blair's company not paying ""enough"" taxes is also absurd, given the context and comparisons drawn in this article, and using it as an example to deride him for not being 'socialist' enough equally so. It also ignores the charitable foundations sponsored through it, as well as the reforms brought about while Labour was in government. Basically you are reacting to the news exactly as the Telegraph has intended.

null,null,OllieGarkey,null,null,null,"I rather like Corbyn, but there's something he's said here which is factually incorrect.

&gt;Obama has very rapidly morphed into a pentagon president, much like all the others, in that he's increased the number of prison places at Bagram, he's failed to close Guantanamo bay...

TL;DR 

Barack Obama doesn't currently have the constitutional or legal authority to do anything Corbyn is talking about. This is important to understand about US politics, because this problem will likely continue for at least a decade after Obama is gone.

Long version:

Here's what needs to be understood. The UK has a political system where the Head of Government and Head of Legislature are the same individual, the prime minister. The US has a political system where the Head of State and Head of Government are the same person, but the Head of Legislature (the speaker for the house) is a separate person. 

The US political system is extremely corrupt, and we have a scenario where the State governments are controlled by the conservative party via artificial methods. Politicians get to pick their voters under the Gerrymandering system, allowing the right wing to entrench itself. Our supreme court gutted the Voting Rights Act, which prevented the more racist areas of the US from restricting voting rights for people who are poor or have skin of various shades other than white or orange. 

The corruption is so entrenched at this point that little is likely to shift in the next decade or so, until Demographics break the system. Essentially, the legislature currently has a semi-permanent conservative majority. The executive has a semi-permanent liberal majority.

The Republicans are widely hated, but have entrenched themselves, which leads them to being more hated.

When a national election occurs, the Democratic candidate will likely win. But when a local election occurs, it is the reverse.

The reason that nothing can be done about Guantanamo Bay or Bagram is because of the interference of the Republicans, who are angry that we aren't still at war in Iraq and Afghanistan, and want to go back. 

They see ISIL as the consequence for leaving, not the consequence of the De-Baathification that the US engaged in.

Since the Republican surge of 2010, Obama has been unable to get anything of consequence done, because of Republican intransigence.

Voters who wish to punish the Republicans find themselves unable to vote, or find themselves put within an election boundary where Democrats have a massive majority, thus preventing battleground seats from even existing. 

Take a look at this district. The green here is a single congressional constituency in Illinois, the Illinois 4th district: 

http://imgur.com/j16fPSZ

Sorry, that's the old map. They fixed it, see:

http://i.imgur.com/uR2D9SE.jpg

And that's just one of over 400 districts, almost all of which are gerrymandered in some way. 

The result of this is that this problem will almost definitely continue beyond Obama's administration. The next congress is almost guaranteed to be Republican, while the next President is almost guaranteed to be Democrat.

More Democrats will vote than Republicans, but we will still end up with a conservative legislature thanks to Gerrymandering and racist restrictions on voting rights in conservative states.",null,0,null,1441042150,null,null,1441046313,0,cum0x4z,null,t3_3j2lfu,null,null,null,t3_3j2lfu,null,null,null,1441609411,null,7,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

Coutinho back into midfield, he's not really a finisher and his main skill is picking out passes but, this only works if there's people to pass too.

We don't seem to have a plan with Benteke, just putting balls in the box achieves nothing, get him some support and play to his strengths of holding the ball up and turning and running at defenders.

I'd give Ings a run, in going to right off Sturridge this season as I believe he'll need a full pre-season before he'll be mentally right, throw in Firmino behind the 2 of them then let's get back to smashing teams!!!!

                        Mingolet
       Clyne.           Skrtel.           Sakho.       Moreno


             Milner.      Hendo.         Coutinho.    

                                   Firmino

                     Ings.                       Benteke

Also note ""the average person"" means the average person on the street (i.e. the entire population) and not the population of people who go to university, so it fails to adjust for the fact that the best predictor of whether someone will go to university is if one of their parents did.

(That said it's almost certainly true that if you know someone who went to Oxbridge then your significantly more likely to go yourself. This is true of almost everything. You're more likely to be a politician, business owner, accountant, lawyer, etc. if you grew up knowing one socially.)",null,0,null,1441044158,null,null,1441045577,0,cum29ii,null,t3_3j2rwp,null,null,null,t1_culuczy,null,null,null,1441610110,null,16,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16,null

Of course. [Labour need an absolutely huge swing in order to win, and most of its votes must come from people who voted Conservative](http://www.fabians.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Mountain-to-Climb.pdf). Kendall, at the very least, would try to target those voters. Corbyn doesn't even try. [The traditional working class abandoned Labour because they were social conservatives who believed we weren't doing enough to tackle welfare spending and immigration](http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/labour-voters-election-europe-immigration). Issues Kendall raises and tries to tackle. Issues Corbyn ignores totally, or worse his answer is to simply tell the electorate that they're wrong.

Do you have any evidence that Corbyn is 'more likely to win' (which, at the very least, means 'like to win more seats; likely to not hurt us in local elections between GEs')?

&gt;And equating Corbyn supporters to being your enemies and Tory allies... pathetic.

Why is it pathetic? Corbyn is by far the worst choice for us and the best choice for the Tories.

&gt;You are being utterly ridiculous. What happend to keeping things civil and not being divisive. The anti-Corbyn circlejerk you subscribe to is the most toxic thing about this subreddit.

There are always ""situations"" that other clubs will use to secure the player that they want in the end. 

I think its more important that smaller clubs like us do business earlier in the transfer window where possible with players moving out so it gives us the time we need to bring in good replacements.

And on the point of us buying ""cheap"" replacements, of course we would like to spend more on established talent, but ask Spurs how well that went for them after Bale, or Liverpool after Suarez.

He states ""This is false"" without being able to back up that statement in any significant way.

There are absolutely questions that need to be asked, I fully agree. And I don't know that I accept what little information I do have about the raid from official sources.

I do know that the rumor mill is out of control on the issue. The thing is, the ISI isn't trustworthy, and often works against US interests.

That's the one piece of information where I think Hersh is probably wrong. I don't think that the ISI would have cooperated on that level. Especially without leaking beforehand. That organization holds information in the same guarded and difficult to penetrate way that a sieve holds water.

That doesn't mean that Hersh is wrong to raise questions, and I certainly want to know the whole story. But knowing what I know of the ISI, I think Hersh's story is less likely than the official account, which I find frustrating. 

There's also this:

&gt;""The killing was the high point of Obama's first term, and a major factor in his re-election.""

Not so much, in reality. It was a fun line to use, but not much more than a way to poke fun at conservatives. ""Osama Bin Laden is Dead and GM is Alive"" was a bumper sticker, not a campaign plank.

Bumper stickers are fun, sure, but they don't win elections.

In that election, the major source of victory was American anger with the Republican Party and its intransigence, as well as anger with the American ruling class and their economic domination of the country.

Occupy Wall Street can claim far more credit for Obama's re-election than Seal Team Six.

With your first source you regret to mention the political conclusions that are also of importance-reconnecting with voters in Labour Heartlands and revive support in Scotland: 
""Labour needs to champion popular, big-tent politics to reach deep into middle England, revive support in Scotland and strengthens relationships with disillusioned voters in former heartlands.""
""The litmus test for Labour’s strategy is simple: can the party win over large numbers of people who voted Conservative and SNP in 2015?""
 
Notice the ""And SNP"" because it is important. You cannot selectively quote pieces for your own benefit. You cannot proclaim one thing is said and ignore the others like they don't exist.

As for the second opinion piece I found that this perfectly expresses it's flaws more succinctly than I can:

""The piece makes several important mistakes. Social Grade Classification that includes C1 posts as ""middle class"" includes millions of jobs that pay minimum wage. The squeeze on living standards renders the assumption that the middle classes are expanding at anything like the rates suggested as devoid of reality. Consumer debt is up 500% at will hit more than £2.2 trillion by 2015. 2% of the Electorate will go bankrupt this term. In addition, Labour lost most votes among the ""private rented sector"". Whilst it is correct to say these people are not social renters, it would be naive to ignore the serious squeeze on their income caused by lack of affordable housing. Annual rents average £8,700+ (and they are even higher in the south). The working poor are absent from this analysis. In terms of policies that are favoured by the majority of the electorate - yes EU &amp; Immigration feature strongly, and yes Labour should reexamine their stance but let us not forget that the most pro-EU &amp; pro-Immigration leader Labour ever had was Tony Blair. Thus, rather that reduce his failings to triangulation and Iraq it is important to recognise that his lack of understanding and clear mistakes in 2005 a la EU expansion are crucial in all of this. Economically, there is less evidence the public embrace right wing thinking. The majority of the electorate support 50p rate, bankers' taxes, mansion tax (£2m) etc. etc. As for predistribution, it offers the key to loosening the squeeze on living standards by curbing rail, energy and other utility price rises. Blair opposed all of this, and this further renders him irrelevant to today. In short, selecting social/political policies that the public have moved right on as justification for resurrecting Blair's right leaning thinking on economics is daft and devoid of polling support.""

null,null,Battle_Biscuits,eng-merseyside,"Wirral ",null,"Well I don't consider a government willing to consider using nukes as my enemy if the circumstances are right. And it's the fact that we have nuclear weapons means we're immune from nuclear blackmail from other states and direct land invasions. The threat that we will use nuclear weapons would deter any state from those sort of actions- and if they use nuclear weapons on us then they in return will also die. It was Mutually Assured Destruction that prevented WW3 during the Cold War, but it's a dangerous game I have to admit.

That's why I'd support multilateral nuclear disarmament, but I would not support the UK doing it alone whilst there are other states which happily maintain their own.

For example, I am on a 2 year fixed rate @ 4.49% (FTB penalty, lol)

After that, my mortgage reverts to the RBS Standard Variable Rate which is currently 4%, which would be a bonus for me at the moment.. However, if the BoE (bank of england) base rate rises, so will that percentage. Any percentage increase in the BoE base rate will likely be reflected in RBS's SVR. 

So if the BoE decide in raising the base rate to 1.5%, then the SVR would likely rise to 5% and I'd then be paying more for my mortgage.

It was neither. Gaddafi was a big fighter for African independence.

And he hosted the [African Investment Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Investment_Bank).

These instruments were designed to help Africa to take care of itself, Gadaffi would often undercut the IMF loans and US security contracts. Don't forget that IMF loans are used to put financial pressure on developing nations, like in prison when you give someone some gum then they're basically your bitch because they ""owe you."" The AU tried to meet Gaddafi when the Libyan civil war started and NATO prevented them from meeting him, they met without him and voted overwhelmingly to oppose NATO's no-fly zone of Libya.

tl;dr he was massively cock-blocking the West from using imperialism and '_soft power_' to control Africa.

null,null,DemandAndSupply,null,null,null,"How old are you? If you're younger than 35, you probably shouldn't be anything less than 80% stocks. Take risks when you're young in order to maximise gains in the long run. This recent dip is known as a market correction, and they happen all the time, consider waiting 6-12 months for your assets to bounce back. Remember you only realise that 6% loss if you actually sell. 

As far as where to hold your money, I would personally recommend maximising a S&amp;S ISA through a broker. I use Hargreaves Lansdown, and whilst not the cheapest with regard to purchasing *stocks,* ( I believe it's about £11.95 per transaction), *funds* are completely free to trade within. 
Also a side note here is that your Nutmeg account has an annual management fee, which is relatively high compared to individual funds as all the work is done behind the scenes for you. When you invest in individual funds through a broker, they each have varying annual management fees, but are much lower than you have at Nutmeg. This is where I mention Vanguard funds - they have some of the lowest fees in the industry, as low as 0.08%. 

Whichever broker you decide to go with, you can purchase a plethora of funds which track indexes or are composed of stocks and bonds, or either of the two individually. As an example, you could put all of your money in one fund, composed of whatever amount of stocks and bonds that fits your risk tolerance, or, you could purchase ten funds that are only composed of stocks or bonds, and buy 8 stock funds and 2 bond funds etc. 

Finally, and although this may sound contradictory to what I have already said, do not try to time the market with regards to transferring your assets. Based on past performance, the market will bounce back, so personally I would wait for that. However if you need money for a house deposit, realising a loss of 6% now, may actually work out in the long run if it means you can put a substantial amount down on a house (20%+), and therefore take a smaller mortgage, or have a shorter term. 

Hope this helps in some way!


EDIT: Also remember that you can split your ISA allowance between S&amp;S and Cash, so if you wanted to hold some money risk free and liquid, you could keep some in a cash ISA as well as investing in the stock market.",null,0,null,1441047546,null,null,false,0,cum4j74,null,t3_3j3xiu,null,null,null,t3_3j3xiu,null,null,null,1441611179,null,-6,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,-6,null

&gt;""And SNP""

What of the SNP? Scotland voted SNP to ensure the devolution settlement they were promised. It's a myth that they voted that way because they were more left wing. Indeed, their manifesto was a carbon copy of ours, and [Scotland is not significantly more left wing, either](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/scotland-blog/2015/mar/26/three-things-the-latest-british-social-attitudes-survey-tells-us-about-scotland).

Besides, we can win elections without Scotland. Most of our majorities have not required Scotland. They have always required English marginals. Not to mention, it's not such a great loss if Scotland goes to our natural allies with an almost identical manifesto. It's a bigger loss if they go to our rival main party with whom we would not be able to make a peacetime coalition or deal.

Leon Brittan. Greville Janner. Harvey Proctor. Edward Heath.

There's a very unpleasent web of connections (and of alleged connections, involving living people, which have not been tested in court) emerging.

https://ianpace.wordpress.com is a place to keep up with the current situation, and also has articles on some of the background of institutional corruption and infiltration by abusers over the past decades.

Yeah I think that Hersh is prone to hyperbole, but to be fair it took away a key plank of the Republican strategy for attacking democrats (paint them as weak etc). But I agree what won the election was the republicans inability to put up a decent 'centrist' candidate. 

I do trust elements of his story slightly more than the CIA who also had nothing to back up much of their claims iirc. Some parts of it (especially 'the walk in' and torture not really being involved etc) were also pretty much said by Robert Baird months (years?) before on a show I listen to.  I also  heard a kind of middle way scenario by some Pakistani expert in which he (pretty credibly but who knows) suggests that Bin laden was in a kind of quasi autonomous holding house, one that the ISI deliberately keeps discreet from general knowledge so that it can house shady characters etc. Still pretty murky all round.

The question is whether their stories fit with other things we know to be true about the region. Hersh's suggestion that Pakistan knew isn't credible, because if they knew, then everyone would have known.

This is factual, though. One of the key facts about torture is that it doesn't work. Torture has never successfully led to anything other than terrorizing a population, which was the main reason that the UK used it so widely in Ireland and India. It was pacification, not information gathering.

We'd be better off to ignore that extra pressure from aiming for a top 4 finish  and kick on with the plan.

1) Secure Premier League status by crossing 40-45 points as quickly as possible (Gary often states this). ££££.

2) If we've done the above, then aim, secure and hold a top half position in the league. ££££££££.

3) If this looks likely towards the second half of the season and we're doing rather well... aim to break our record points and push for a Europa place. Maybe even a cup! ££££££££££££.

&gt;There were a number of things that I thought had to be pointed out. By now, I think they’re hardly even controversial. But one was that the claim that the U.S. was being attacked because, as the president put it, they hate our freedoms was completely untenable. They hated our policy. In fact, it would be more accurate to say we hate their freedoms.

Even the worst person might theoretically be redeemable if we had infinite time and patience and could prevent them from harming others for the duration. 

Or if they're *not* redeemable, then the tragic part occurred when they were pushed past the moral event horizon by whatever circumstance of their environment, or accident of genetics/development did that.

That we have to resort to killing some people is a result of not having the luxury of infinite time/resources/options, and hence having to aim for ""better"" outcomes (kill the one as the only way to prevent them from killing/hurting the many) rather than ""ideal"" outcomes (no-one having to die).

Many of the borders of the Middle-Eastern countries currently involved in the fighting were decided on by Western forces about 100 years ago and utterly failed to take tribal borders into consideration (underlying intentions regarding this are subject to debate).  This meant that, in countries such as Iraq, multiple tribes have been forced into one nation despite tribal differences.  To add to this, tribal borders were sliced by national borders.  So now people in the same tribe are from two separate nations, great.  Meanwhile, the tribe that happens to have the national capital has to somehow control the peripheral tribes that feel more loyalty to their tribal borders and don't want to be controlled by another tribe practising another variant of Islam.  The peripheral tribes resist the capital.  The capital is seen by us as ""the government"" of that nation, leading the resisting tribes into being labeled ""rebels"" when in fact we are seeing inter-tribe hostility.

And this hostility is the result of a dynamic introduced by the West.

Hmm.  I don't think I would 'regret' seeing Al Baghdadi taken out by an airstrike.

Well, OK - but in that case it's the *life* which is the tragedy.  

Look - I agree that in some theoretical sense, it is unfortunate that we live in a world in which the way we deal with some people is to terminate them with extreme prejudice.  BUT, I think your time is best spent thinking about the suffering inflicted on the people who died as a result of people like Bin Laden's actions, rather than Bin Laden himself.

Is it a tragedy that he was shot?  Who cares?  Honestly, I can't think why it's worth more than a second's thought.  As long as he died quickly and without undue suffering then it doesn't bother me at all.

null,null,Esco91,null,null,null,"The most interesting at the moment seems to be the Labour leadership.

Labour are traditionally the social democratic part, but they haven't had a leader that could be described as a Socialist since the early 90s (John Smith) and in 1997 decided to rebrand as essentially a neo liberal party. Since then they haven't had anyone from the left of their party get into a strong position, now suddenly this one guy (Corbyn) has become the favourite. The other candidates have broadly similar attitudes and policies, and are fairly typical of what Labour has seen a lot of in the past 20 years, career focused young politicians who have kowtowed to business in order to further their and their families careers after political life.

This has caused chaos within the party, but brought them a lot of attention and undoubtedly support in some areas. After years of declining membership figures, applications to join have shot up, as joining gives you voting rights. 

Currently the Labour HQ, which is mostly staffed by the supporters of other candidates, is trying dirty tricks to stop Corbyn winning, such as refusing to respond to applications and using the excuse they are probably opponents trying to influence the vote.

At the same time the Conservatives are having alternate responses to this. In public most Conservatives are saying it's a bad thing (after all, Corbyn would make life hard for them in opposition) but in reality many are happy because they also see him as unelectable in a general election. Meanwhile the more crazy right wingers (think your equivalents of Sarah Palin) are treating him and his ideas like his is the devil incarnate, and the media is pretty much backing them up with this.

null,null,agentdcf,flair8,,null,"What exactly is ""level-headedness"" and ""motivation"" here? A willingness to accept below-market wages? Doesn't the market incentivize precisely the opposite of that? And what's with the motivation? Isn't the motivation for ALL players money? No one's out there playing for charity, are they? Why do you think that certain players will suffer for being paid what the market determines is fair, while others apparently won't? 

Look, you're viewing this whole thing through an individualized, moral lens: you're assuming this young player is being paid too much, and so therefore he won't want to train very hard and improve himself (though presumably he'd earn EVEN MORE in that case). Even if that's true for him, you're ignoring the broader socio-economic effects. If wages and transfer fees for younger players are going up, that increases the incentives for all clubs and all potential players to work harder, since the rewards are greater. Clubs who might not have worried much about investing in their academies now have a greater incentive to do so--and that will increase the level of training across the sport. Young players on the fence between pursuing football and taking up a trade or going to university now have a greater incentive to pursue football as a career. Those developments will raise the quality of football across the whole continent, whether some players are the top are overpaid or not. 

I recall a hockey announcer describing how the game had changed since his career in the 1980s and with young players coming through today. He said today, increased wages for the athletes had improved the possibility of life-changing money via a professional career  that far more young men were dedicating themselves to a career in sports. Kids that would have once followed their fathers into the local fire department, or steel mill, or gone off to university now spent a few years more trying to make it as an athlete. The result then is that the pool of talent was larger, and the investments made both by these kids and by their clubs was greater. As such, the quality of play was better pretty much across the board.",null,0,null,1441049600,null,null,false,0,cum5w4n,null,t3_3j2rgi,null,null,null,t1_cum2r0h,null,null,null,1441611820,null,1,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

null,null,POPAccount,null,null,null,"I completely agree with your assessment that money spent at Liverpool is not the same as money spent at any of the top four clubs. Top players don't want to come to Anfield, so we must overpay to obtain talent.  This is the reason why we must make the most of the talent that we do have. Rodgers consistently plays players out of position, leaves our best players on the bench, and/or continues to select his favorite players, regardless of whether their performances justifies their inclusions in the team. His squad selections are too often baffling to fans and pundits alike. The reasons are rarely vocalized, so we are all left to wonder what is going on behind the scenes. 

I am not one of those fans who believe that we have a right to an explanation for everything that happens in private, but we better see the results on the pitch if you want to justify your player selections. My guess is, only by pure speculation, that Rodgers places a premium on player attitudes in practice and private conversations.  This may explain some of the more peculiar personnel decisions that he has made, but my question is ""Is it working?""  Is Rodgers making the correct character judgements during the week that will put the correct players on the pitch on the weekend?  I don't have a lot of faith that he is doing this correctly. I would prefer that he pick players who perform on the pitch, regardless of if they gave some back chat earlier in the week. I care more about winning than protecting the manager's delicate sensitivities. The modern football manager has to be able to deal with the massive egos of the modern football player, and I don't see Rodgers doing that. It's a great idea to fill out your squad with humble, club first supporters but those players are increasingly rare.

The level of respect you offer up for your fellow labour members is shocking. Your obsession with placing blame and guilt is extremely childish and is actively contributing to dividing this party.

The article you sent me about the SNP confirms nothing. Did you read it? It would have been helpful to have the corresponding bars for the England and Wales study. 

The EU numbers for example, 35.2% want the EU to stay as is or, indeed, for EU powers to be increased and a further 40.3% want to stay in but trim the EU a tad (what does this even mean in practice?). What are the corresponding numbers for England and Wales?

Tax 47.7% want tax to stay as is and 43.8% want taxes be increased. Not exactly a ringing endorsement of Tory ""small state"" ideology (also endorsed by Liz). Again what are the relative numbers?

Statistics need to be treated very carefully before you can deduce anything about what people actually think. People are perfectly able to demand greater spending on Defence, the NHS etc and demand tax cuts without so much as batting an eyelid.

I'm impressed that you are so desperate to tell me that Scotland is as right wing as England as if this is some sort of reason for a victory dance. Firstly, given the reluctance to lower tax, is the data saying that either country is particularly neo-liberal (I'm not sure the TPA would find those numbers comforting) and secondly, given the lack of comparative bars how do they know that the data says what they think it says? Perhaps you just want it to fit your narrative and so disregard it's flaws.

The Scottish Labour Party meanwhile (i.e. people with experience) have rallied behind Jeremy Corbyn:

What has Townsend done, statistically, which aren't the be all and end all, but assists = goals = points. What's Andros done? Really? 

Eriksen looks ineffective at times with no movement in front of him. Every post-match thread bemoans this lack of penetration, aimless passing, even when Lamela isn't playing. Shall we sell him too? The Spurs ruining of players continues; touted as the future Riquelme, bested him as a youngster vs Boca, stormed Seria A and was named Tottis heir, by the fans and *Totti* himself. Now we can't wait to see the back of a player that was a coup for us and to be fair, took a step sideways and maybe slightly up or down joining us, depending on how you see it. 

If we bring nobody in, and I mean all out on Witsel or someone in that mold who isn't a mediocre piece of squad depth or overrated English talent (in which case for the Lamela haters - why not keep him?), what is the point of this? The ONLY reason is is that I imagine the fee, if it's a transfer, will be decent from Levy and if it's not reinvested ASAP and we end up with some bullshit then...I'm not gonna be impressed.

How Townsend even remains here and not shopped of to a Villa style side for a ridiculous English premium is beyond me. If this fee is something like 15m-20m euros max, which it smells a lot like, why not just get rid of Andros? Unless, of course, even THEY don't want him.

Current state:  meh.  We have a lot of talent, but it doesn't seem to be gelling like it ought to be.  Players like Lukaku, Barkley, McCarthy, and Stones really ought to be magic bullets almost, but there's something not right about how Martinez is running the club.  People still guardedly trust him, but there's a disquiet.  Finishing 11th last year, was simply unacceptable, and this is a make-or-break year for Martinez, IMO.

I'm just starting to grok the board stuff.  Basically, it seems that people are upset that Kenwright (owner) and the board haven't done enough to grow the club (new ground, marquee players, etc).  There seems to be a fair amount of debt and people are starting to ask questions why that is.  This is very cursory (and likely wrong), so someone more in the know would be best off answering.

Transfers.  Okay, there are two windows each year that players can be moved around (not just the Prem, but all leagues).  Tomorrow ends the summer window that has been open since June, and there will be a shorter one in the winter (January).  Players who's contract is up and negotiate a new contract with their club or move to a new club with no money changing hands to the losing club - called ""on a free"".  If the player has time on his contract, the the gaining club will negotiate a fee with the losing club to buy out his contract.  It's not just the contract's value - it's the PLAYER'S value.  If you buy Joe Smith cheap, and he turns out to be amazing, then you'll ask far more than that initial contract is worth.  Investment thinking.  Sometimes, a player can hand in a transfer request if they want out, but the contract rules - if the club wants to (like with Stones), they can refuse the request.

Hopefully, I got things at least 95% right - I'm sure corrections will appear.  :)

null,null,leredditaccounts,null,null,null,"&gt;Refugees are human. This simple fact seems to have been forgotten

And here's a few other simple facts: most of these ""refugees"" are illegal economic immigrants who come here because our welfare is 10x higher than in the many other safe countries they passed on their way here.

Nextly, their welfare, and social housing, are both resources paid for by British citizens. Thirdly, they are consuming these resources *instead* of them going to british citizens. In high immigrant areas it can take weeks to get a doctor's appointment. Schooling places and social housing are being stressed by them too.

Fourthly, emotional blackmail does not make it ok for thousands of north africans to come here.

Fifthly, politicians do not spend their time crying or making emotional appeals. They may make 1 teary eyed speech, then they get to work figuring out what can be done about the problem, instead of having a circlejerk over what a tragedy it is.

I also see the typical immigrant defence force shitposters are at work in this thread too (such as anandya). Keep on the straight and steady fellows. And to top things off, I'll say that I'm descended from non-eu immigrants from asia and I think a lot of white people in Britain need to let go of their white guilt. 

The moral preening and guilt-tripping is only done by people who don't do anything useful with their lives: good people come up with solutions.

S1. Theft Act - A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving them of it.

You cannot have theft unless all five points are met, which is why we have fraud offences.

With fraud, there is no appropriation of property. The gain or loss need not be monetary, and it need not be realised for the offence to be committed. 

If I sell you a counterfeit ticket, purporting it to be genuine, I commit the offence of fraud by false representation (S2 Fraud Act 2006), the gain being the money. There's no appropriation, because you've given the money to me willingly, albeit as a result of the false representation.

If you take a ticket you know to be counterfeit and offer it up for entry, purporting it to be real, you commit fraud by false representation. You've represented that it is real and you make a gain by obtaining the service (and expose the event to a loss by taking up the capacity of a paying customer)

Besic hasn't really been playing much but when he had that game against Barnsley he looked decent.

And for transfers, a player can hand in a transfer request to the manager/board and the manager/board decide whether or not to accept or deny the request.

If The Price is Right (;)) then the club can acept the bid, then the bidding club discusses the contract with the player. When/If the player feels satisfied with the contract being offered, they head over to the club, get a physical done (if they fail the physical they wont be able to play for the club and the transfer is off, i think), and then the player is plays for that club and the club that sold the player gets the money that the club bid.

Studies of prices in small, desirable areas of [Manhattan](http://economics.mit.edu/files/5887)  over 100 years and [Amsterdam](http://digitalarchive.maastrichtuniversity.nl/fedora/get/guid:cda347a3-7fdf-426e-99a4-1a2c30717764/ASSET1) over 400 years show real house price appreciation of around zero.

The high house price inflation that has been seen globally and in the UK in particular in recent decades should absolutely not be taken as typical of the very long term trend. It has much more to do with the [falling interest rates](http://i.imgur.com/HEFSveg.png) and [low, stable inflation](http://i.imgur.com/YdtwpRC.png) (data also from Shiller's website) with rapidly expanding credit over the period. The best data is available for the US but the picture is similar in the UK.

In the short term, house prices are determined by what people can afford and what house prices have done over recent years, not by any kind of economic fundamentals.

Venice is a but more of a pain. I'd recommend staying on the main island ('Venice'). It is possible to walk everyehere within the main island, but you always have to go in a roundabout fashion because you can only cross the canals where there's a bridge. You really need a map to get around, and throw away you long learned preconceptions about walking in the direction you want to go in - that doesn't work in Venice. It's much easier to get around if you have a bus pass (it's valid on the waterboat ferry service and also buses to mainland and on Lido).

As for what to do, in Florence there's the Duomo (the famous church) which is free to enter (€10 if you want to go into the two museums, climb the dome and the bell tower). But make sure you turn up before 11am - after that they do some kind of one in one out system and the queue is torturous. There's also the Academia (home to Michelangelo's David) and Uffuzi Gallery (lots if classical Italian art). For both of those you should buy tickets in advance if you don't want to be queuing for upwards of three hours.

In Venice there's the famous Piazza San Marco with the tower and the church and the palace. There's also Murano which is famous for its glass, and Lido which essentially a big beach. I really liked San Erasmo as well. It isn't really a touristy island - its basically just farmland - but it was really nice to walk around on and had some great beaches which were completely empty (unlike Lido which is packed like sardines).",null,0,null,1441050956,null,null,false,0,cum6sg3,null,t3_3j2msh,null,null,null,t1_cum64tn,null,null,null,1441612243,null,3,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

Why is Townsend still here by that logic? What HAS he done? He's 24. What did he do when Bale left? I remember one flukey cross that resulted in a goal. I also remember Lamela getting 7 assists in the league last year.

null,null,RifleEyez,null,null,null,"&gt;As for Townsend, the reason why he's here and not gone for a ridiculous premium is because he's not worth it. However, what he is, is direct and offers a genuine difference off either flank.

I'm sure that Villa, QPR, a side around that level with the TV money would have stumped up a fee that wouldn't be too far of what we may get for Lamela. If nobody wants Townsend, what does that tell you? If he offers such a difference, why has he got less assists in this entire career than Lamela has in one season with us? 

&gt; He's a Spurs player of over a decade and a fan to boot and seeing as he's hardly the worst player in the world being kept only as a charity gesture, I'm in no rush to sell him.

I'm all for our English lads. Homegrown. Mason, Kane, lots of love for the others that come through like Rose, Walker, who developed essentially under us. Nabil too. Townsend is 24, and has less assists than Lamela had last year in his entire career. Does that mean because Townsend is a fan, and more passionate, he should stay over someone who has been more effective than him purely because of some fondness for his situation? (assists = goals = points)

We're aiming for the top 4, not carrying passengers out of pity. I would be okay with this, if it meant the funds for Lamela (which will be decent, knowing Levy) was hinging on a REAL signing to strengthen us.

null,null,Leslie217,null,null,null,"this transfer window is a complete failure to be honest

I cannot understand why they need to wait until the defeat to MC to bring in a real outfield player - Baba (falcao is loan, another is GK)

The key for a team to be success in a new season is always a good preparation, panic buying at the end of the month will only screw you over, this has been proven time and time again (Spurs, Arsenal....etc)

How and why would the club think that we only need falcao and a backup gk in a new season as a defending champion? Our squad depth is shit, our defenders are old and short in numbers (6), we dont have reliable substitute to key players like Hazard, Matic and Cesc, why would Roman/Jose/wtever think we are good enough to not buy any one in the transfer market?

Secondly, the way they treat this window is bad, focus on Stones and Pogba I can understand, but where are the plan B? There are lots of other players could be bought, otamendi, kondogbia, Wayama...etc, where are the bids? Where are the plan B when Plan A is not working?

Now we have 4pts in 4matches, the situation sucks and is even harder for us to get players as they knew we need them desperately, as MC spending over 150m+, why not just give everton 50m and they would definitely sell Stones to us, where are the moves?

I am very disappointed to this season to be honest, when i saw we only have falcao and backup GK in the opening match I already knew this wont go well, I just dont expect a total disaster like this, and the club is still not buying anyone promising makes me very worry in this season chance of qualifying CL and even the position of Mourinho, everyone knows Roman is not a patient man and he will pull the trigger if things get ugly in October",null,1,null,1441051656,null,null,false,0,cum79az,null,t3_3j3343,null,null,null,t3_3j3343,null,null,null,1441612463,null,2,null,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2,null

null,null,CyberGnat,null,null,null,"LVT doesn't punish anything other than the inefficient use of land. If a farmer's field has been identified as being suitable for new housing or some other development, then its value will rise accordingly and so the owner will be taxed accordingly. If the land can't be used, then its value is diminished greatly.

In city centres, what you're describing is just how that applies in city centres. In central London, it is inefficient for a plot of land to be used by fewer people than it could actually be used for. To escape the LVT punishment, a land owner has to develop it as much as possible as quickly as possible. If their plot of land is suitable for a 50-storey residential skyscraper, then they will be taxed as if they have one there already, so they have to build a 50 storey residential skyscraper. There are huge areas of London where land is used inefficiently, leading to less economic growth and worsening the housing crisis.

LVT wouldn't mean demolishing all of London and replacing it with a Le Corbusier vision of multi-storey towers. The value of a plot of land will also depend upon other planning conditions. For example, the value of the land taken up by a public park will be set to zero if the planning policy says there should be a park there. The economic value of listed buildings would depend on what it would be possible to do with the site without damaging the listed features. This isn't some hypothetical thing either, since the market already prices buildings according to any planning conditions on them. No one is going to pay billions of pounds for Hyde Park if it went up for sale when you're not going to be allowed to do anything special with it, even if a simplistic calculation of what it could be worth based on average value per square metre nearby says it would be worth that.",null,0,null,1441051744,null,null,false,0,cum7bff,null,t3_3j2kka,null,null,null,t1_culwtzm,null,null,null,1441612492,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Now mid-table clubs are coming in and buying players like Payet and Shaquiri?  That's definitely going to stave off the crash for a bit, but I think it's going to hit harder once it touches down.

It's the same as any market -- overvaluation looks good for a while but is ultimately unsustainable.  Eventually, the market will correct itself, but I don't think there'll be too much damage done other than English players will drop back down in price, and clubs will start getting a little more reserved in their expenditures.

Of course, even with all that being the case, the mancs or pool or arsenal are still going to pay through the nose (mostly just the mancs, but the other top contenders too, to a degree) for anybody they express interest in.
