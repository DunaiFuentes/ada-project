Cuts always affect the poorest - by their very nature they are taking money away from the state which is relied upon far more by the poor. Any policy to cut spending will do that. The real question here is whether there are mechanisms to make sure “the poorest” don’t stay that way or we can lower their reliance on the state, to offset those cuts. Economically conservative policies by their very definition favour the method of lowering taxes to offset the lack of government support.

It’s also worth noting that to achieve growth during consolidation, consensus suggests cutting spending is significantly better for the economy than raising taxes.

I don’t think the conservatives have communicated this particularly well, perhaps because it’s more nuanced than “no more debt"". Fiscal conservatism isn’t about saving big businesses cash, it’s about a different worldview in how we can create social mobility and lower the tax burden for everyone, in particular working class people.

If you expect any kind of crime scene evidence to be taken you really need to fight with them. The theives had pissed all over mine as well as handling it, yet because I recovered it myself (wearing gloves) they couldn't see how it was feasible to take prints/dna. A bunch of lazy bone idle twunts. A letter to GMP Greif Inflictor (Cheif Inspector) only came to an apology and nothing more.

At first I thought it had been taken to be dismantled for parts, then when found realised it was a joy ride thing.

Holding out hope for you dude. I'll keep an eye out as I'm in and around Manchester. But please take note of my previous ramblings; you will have to do the police work yourself. The cock gobbling thundercunt low lifes that took mine didn't even get their collars felt, even though full CCTV pictured the whole theft on camera with clear faces etc.

Grrrrr Greater Manchester Police are no better than dealing with the Afghan National Police. I don't wish what happens to me on the aggitators/aggresors but on the police that fail to act reasonably or sensibly.

Get onto some garages in the area too! They get offered parts a lot. Keep your eyes on Gumtree, eBay and things like that. Hopefully it shows up there and you can go and gape their arseholes with the widest silencer you can find.

Germany? Significant in NATO?

Their army is in terrible condition. They use broomsticks on excercises, when they finally decided to send weapons to the Kurds they didn't have any working transport planes to even get to Iraq. They had to use a Netherlands military transport plane lol.

Germany is internationally respected, but militarily its pretty much a joke. Sure it has good equipment, but most of its not been serviced for a long time and requires maintenance before it can be used.

Britain is the second most ""influential"" nation in NATO, behind America. Then its France and then Germany.

null,false,citizen1862,lfc87,,null,"**Lallana**: Unlike many here I think he's a very useful player. Extremely versatile, hard-working, creative and has an incredible first touch. The only problem is injuries, but if he can stay fit I think he could be a key player next season.

**Moreno**: We've all noted his defensive lapses but this is hardly unforgivable for a 22 year old adapting to a new league. He's very good going forward, and if he can improve his concentration defensively he'll have that position locked down for the foreseeable future.

**Emre Can**: I'm sure we're all in agreement that this lad was our best signing. He's already looking like a bargain and after having turned 21 only a few months ago it looks like he'll become a force of nature given time. He's really impressed at CB but his future is surely in the middle of the park.

**Markovic:** He's had a hit and miss season. The potential is there for all to see but he's struggled to perform consistently. Like Can he only turned 21 recently so he has age on his side, but he has to improve. Hard to judge him at this point as he was always going to be a signing for the future.

Those are the four who I think have already shown themselves to be good signings, or who I believe will in the future. Now onto the other signings:

**Lovren**: Nobody can argue that he hasn't been a disappointment. Looked out of his depth for a while, though he has looked a little more comfortable in the last few months. It  sometimes takes a while for CBs to settle into a new backline so I think he may be a useful player in the future, but he must do better next season.

**Lambert**: He was always going to be a backup and nobody expected him to score 20 goals but he's disappointed even with low expectations. He's loyal and seems like a cool guy but I think we should let him go.

**Ballotelli**: Like many I really wanted him to flourish here but if we get a decent offer for him in the summer I think we should let him go. He doesn't suit our playing style and can't lead the line on his own, so I think we need to replace him.

So in conclusion I think time will lead to us looking favourably on last summer, as I fully believe a number of our signings will become key players. The fatal flaw in our signings was our inability to find a striker who could properly fill Sturridge's boots. That must be the number one priority in the summer.

Lovren is starting to look better although I do feel that we overpaid a little for him relative to what we've received in return. You could make the same argument for Balotelli but to be honest he's not really the type of player that works in the system that we're going for which is all about high pressing and some pace.

I don't think Lambert was that good a signing especially since Balotelli, a somewhat similar striker, was also bought. He's made some decent hold up play off the bench but nothing amazing.

2013-2014 was good for me: sahko will be a rock for us for years, as will migs. toure was a stop gap and hopefully if he doesn't resign, will provide a path way for either ilori, wisdom or lloyd jones...i suspect ilori will come back and slot in the squad because i love what i see in that kid. aspas was a gamble worth trying, for 7m if he had been anything like chicarito was for man u, it was worth it. we'll sell him and make probably half our money back, which i guess is ok for a gamble like that. alberto is a curious case. i don't think he was ever really BR's first choice, but he is undeniably talented. i think he lacks the physicality for the premier league, but he may end up with the squad next year. highly talented and creative player. personally like him a lot. 

2014-2015: was buying for the future, with mixed immediate results but with potential to be an amazing window. 

lambo was a stop gap and might leave this summer
lallana is hugely talented and i think when healthy amazingly perfect for this squad
balotelli was a gamble that if we keep him i think will turn out to be seen as a bargain buy
lovren is talented but needs to find his groove again
markovich is one for the future, and next year could be his coming out party
origi is the same as marko
moreno showed glimpses of why we went for him. is a very solid full back with good attacking qualities and great pace.

&gt;

&gt;The __Hillsborough disaster__ occurred on 15 April 1989 at the [1988–89 FA Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988%E2%80%9389_FA_Cup) semi-final match between [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) and [Nottingham Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.) at [Hillsborough Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_Stadium), [Sheffield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield), England.

&gt;A [crush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_crush) resulted in the deaths of 96 people and injuries to 766 others. The incident has since been blamed primarily on the police for letting too many people enter the stadium. It remains the worst stadium-related disaster in British history, and one of the world's worst football disasters. 

&gt;The [Football Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association) (FA) selected Hillsborough (home ground of [Sheffield Wednesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Wednesday) football club) for the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. Liverpool fans were allocated the Leppings Lane stand,  entry to which was possible only via one of seven decrepit turnstiles,  a restriction that led to dangerous overcrowding outside the ground before kick-off. In an attempt to ease pressure outside the ground, [Chief Superintendent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Superintendent) David Duckenfield, the senior police officer responsible for the match, ordered an exit gate to be opened. The opened exit gate led to a tunnel marked ""Standing"", which led directly to the two already overcrowded enclosures. In previous years, the tunnel had been closed off by police when the two central pens were full; however, on this occasion the tunnel was unmanned.

You still need multiple crews to man the three boats. The life expectancy of the boats would reduce. I personally believe it will be a false economy and save no money at all. 

The main issue remains the inability to provide 365/24/7 CASD though. I don't think people realise the level of 'standby' stuff you need in order to make this happen. 

Do they know, for example, that the stand on CASD vessel smashed into the french vessel at sea and had to be relieved on task immediately by another boat. Do they know that when we say 'maintenance' we don't mean like when you put your car into the garage once or twice a year. We're talking a whole year in dock, sometimes 18 months. When we say 'training' are they aware that this means firing a missile off the coast of the US after every refit to ensure everything is still working. When we say 'training', are they aware that this means a full work up (i.e. taking an untested crew and a newly rebuilt boat and ensuring every element of it works). No one would allow an untrained crew on an untested boat to hold and potentially launch nuclear missiles. 

We either do this properly, and safely, or we do not do it at all. There is no middle ground. There is no '3 boat solution'. It's 4 or nothing. If you are happy with the gaps in cover that a 3 boat cycle gives us then you must also be happy with none at all.

It's about a lack of minority representation rather than racism.

Many of Ukip's politicians (councillors, MEPs, PPCs) have been accused of racism and xenophobia over things they've said (including Farage). This question is relevant because it speaks to that narrative. It's not relevant to Labour, the Tories, or anyone else, because no one thinks they are a racist party.

It wasn't a cheap shot, it was a valid question. Farage &amp; co. deny claims of racism and xenophobia, yet the only non-white face in Ukip's manifesto is that of someone in a developing country, not someone from this country. It's an important distinction because it subconsciously propels the racist and xenophobic narrative of Ukip as a party. That non-white people are poor and in need and require our help to get ahead.

If you're a non-white voter and you read Ukip's manifesto, surely you'd want to see yourself represented in the party seeking your vote? Someone might say 'it's about the policies, doesn't matter etc'. Well it does. Which is why people shout about the representation of women too.

Why would you even say that? Look at how long it took Real Madrid to win La Decima. There's a lot of factors that can make or break a team in CL. Injuries during the league mathes, players dropping their form in the knockout stages, lack of knowledge about your opponent, stamina and fatigue when games go to extra time, and come on you always have the chance of going to penalties.

Assuming we are gonna win it is just naive.  For all we know it will take us just as long as it took Real, when Mourinho is long gone.

And to answer your question, even if we do win it with Jose, I think he's in here for the long run.

Where did you get the 25% figure from?  Talk about moving the goal posts.  What difference does that percentage make effectively?  What happens exactly when the percentage changes from 20% to 25%?  

Surely, 50% non-muslims would be more preferable?  In that case, why even bother with a muslim school at all?

&gt;If a quarter of the students don't believe it, the school can't pretend it is the only worldview and that anyone who doesn't hold it is evil.

They live in Britain.  It would be hard to convince anyone that their worldview was the only one.  Obviously, something else is going on.  Something you don't understand.

&gt;That is a lot more important than whether the non-adherents attend the religious classes or not.

It's more easily effective.  An easy effective prevention is better than a difficult and ineffective control.  Clearly, regulating Islamic schools doesn't work well, even under the close scrutiny that exists in Britain.

&gt;My point is not to give them things which they can persuade rational people are evidence of intolerance.

This is absolutely mad!  So, treating everyone the same regardless of religion is somehow intolerant now?  Equality in education is intolerant?  Saying to a child, sorry, only x percentage of your kind are allowed at this school is tolerant?  What kind of bizarre backwards logic is that?

&gt;The narrative is going to exist, the point is to keep it absurd.

But somehow not funding religious schools through taxes makes it legit?

&gt;There are a lot of excellent faith schools.

Good **selective** schools get good grades.  That's not some magical miracle that only religious schools are capable of, especially as many of them (Anglican) are barely actually religious and more culturally religious.  Good grammar schools were just as good.

&gt;only 30% of the population describe themselves as religious.

Not being religious is not the same thing as being atheist.  Your definition is so far off the mark, I don't know what to say.  Maybe try to understand the very basics of something to avoid showing how little you know.

&gt;I simply don't understand how you could get that from what I said, it seems a bit unrelated to my point.

Your little paragraph reveals a lot about your views.  It uncovers a hysterical, paranoid persecution complex.  Which I think is at the heart of your strong fondness for religious schools despite the evidence for their use in creating division and radicalising people.

&gt;To respond directly, though, I would say that there is no harm done by having a few prayers in school.

I disagree.  You see, what's funny about Christian hypocrisy is how easily it is uncovered.  Take ""harmless"" prayers to Jesus.  Now, note how quickly the same people lose it when those prayers become Islamic prayers.  All of a sudden, they don't want their children praying to Allah.  Somehow changing just the name alters whether it's harmless or not.

You know what happens when muslim children are encouraged to ""harmlessly"" pray to Jesus?  Their parents move them into islamic schools.  It unnecessarily encourages more division and makes them more susceptible to radical Islam.  The very problem which has to be tackled.

Why allow the problem to develop in the first place?  Why not easily and effectively prevent the problem, instead of managing damage control?  Is it really worth all the trouble not to mention all the money wasted?

The RN, as I understand it, prefers to operate on a 1-in-3 system with regards to its vessels. This means that, ideally, one is operational, one is training as relief, one in refit/deep maintenance. This is a system used across the fleet. At the moment, with 4 boats, we have the ability to absorb one in a deep refit incl. a refuelling, one on patrol and two prepping for their next operational deployments. 

If you assume that we were to renew Trident with 3 hulls, and also that we wished to maintain Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD), then you end up with little to no flexibility in the system in case of the inevitable 'unforeseen' problems that can occur. It would only take one unplanned event (such as a mechanical breakdown) to render the fleet unable to maintain the CASD.

Balotelli was never going to fit in, anyone can tell you he's not going to run the channels or press hard. On top of that, he doesn't seem to understand that he is a striker when he plays for us, always dropping deep.

Lovren isn't great with the ball, slow on the turn and makes rash tackles. I still think he can be a good defender but someone like Schar seems a much better fit for us.

Lallana obviously fits our team, and his 10 or so goals in the league last season is the kind of signing we needed to replace the goals lost in Suarez. However, £25m is very steep but I think if not for injuries he'd show his worth. Then again, he does seem very injury prone as Southampton fans warned us he would be.

Markovic seemed to be our backup for Sanchez, which makes no sense whatsoever. He's not a great finisher, he's more of a natural winger. Sanchez would have offered the kind of threat of goals from wide we'd be missing with Suarez gone, especially with his runs off defenders. I like Markovic but this is why he's our biggest mistake along with Balotelli since his signing prevented us from buying the kind of player we'd sorely needed in the first half of the season. Someone like Son or Schurrle (not that Chelsea would sell).

If we had used the Markovic/Balotelli money on a striker / wide forward (£36m) we'd have had a much, much better season. Also, we have Ibe now who looks just as good as Markovic (also Suso left for game time).

Moreno and Can are the right type of players. Even though Moreno has struggled defensively I think he'll get a lot better. Lambert was merely a backup and plan B.

Alberto, Aspas and Ilori cost £21m combined. That is absolutely shocking. If you look at the kind of players available for around that sum it will drive you crazy.

No, you told me at length how I was using the phrase ""PR"" wrong, I mean I can go back and quote your entire post if you like, but I hope you know what you've written.

If you want to reject the idea that AV is ""more proportional"" that's fine, but they are two different points. One is claiming that I don't know what I'm talking about, the other is claiming you disagree with my assessment. You did the former, not the latter.

&gt; I cannot accept that any system that can produce less representative results under far from unusual circumstances can ever be described as anything approaching a more proportional voting system. That's just a fallacy.

So you accept that FPTP can be considered proportional because it's possible for an election result to match the popular vote? That's an odd position to take. My argument is that most the time, unless there's unusal circumstances, the system is more portional. The fact that under a specific set of circumstances that would be highly unusual it can be less proportional doesn't change that.

&gt;If you've got nothing nice to say, I would suggest you say nothing. Such ad hominem attacks rarely endear people to your side, and more often than not highlight the fact that you are struggling to actually attack my argument.

The truth hurts. Your argument has been demolished by me so I don't know what you're on about. You told me that I kept using the phrase ""PR"" wrong yet when I asked you to quote me even using the phrase you can't do it. 

This is the first post where you've solely address the idea that I'm aware of what PR means but I'm not even talking about it, and instead I'm talking about the relative proportionality of the systems. You want to disagree with that that's cool, but that's different to telling me I don't know what I'm on about by putting words into my mouth, which is what I did.

&gt;I was merely responding to the suggestion you made that you were more qualified than me, the irony in the last bit I've quoted is not lost on me.

Please, feel free to quote where I said that I was more qualified than you. You said I was using a word wrong, I said that I hoped my study meant I wasn't. I never once mentioned you or your potential qualifications. This is another instant where you have tried to claim I've said something which, when I ask you to quote me saying it, it will turn out I haven't.

I don't need to endear people to my side when they are busy telling me what ""my side"" is anyway (which by the way if you want to talk logical fallacies is a straw man argument).",null,0,null,1429106495,null,0,false,0,cqd4b2z,null,t3_32l24s,null,t1_cqd4b2z,null,t1_cqd3u1i,null,null,null,1432404007,null,0,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,0,null

The player market basically mirrors that of the stock market. Most of these players are never brought in with the expectation that they will break through the team, they are brought in for financial gain - simple as that. The same economics apply here as they do for the stock market: Buy Low, Sell High. Chelsea has become one of the most successful clubs at this over the years. For the majority, the objective here is simply to buy talent at low cost when they are young, train them, and then sell them at a profit after a spectacular season (much like the one they just had). Dutch soccer clubs have been exercising this train-and-sell model successfully for years as their only source of income.

What? How have I ever implied that? Because I said the opposite isn't true? That's some interesting logical analysis. 

FPTP in exception circumstances can produce proportional results. As can AV. Neither should be considered proportional, that's not their aim, that's not what they're designed to do. Neither are proportional. They're both rubbish in that regard. Although AV allows electors to show preferences in selecting their local representative, I think you are massively overplaying the impact this will have on the national vote, and its levels of representation of how people voted.

It's worth bearing in mind that the HRA itself doesn't say anything that requires prisoner voting - so there's no amendment needed there. Privacy is a bit more complicated as Parliament seems incapable of passing any law on privacy; given the increasing interest in it during the 90s and 00s, it is possible the courts would have expanded privacy anyway, or the lack of a privacy law could have forced Parliament to pass one.

The stuff about family life is generally the more controversial part of the right to privacy, but the Government has already changed the law on that (not sure how well it will go down) - many of the highly-published cases in that area, though, seem to be situations where the Courts use the HRA to override what they see as unjust decisions by the executive; something they were happy to do before, but now they have a statutory framework for it.",null,0,null,1429107092,null,0,false,0,cqd4mrp,null,t3_32o61f,null,t1_cqd4mrp,null,t1_cqd0v5f,null,null,null,1432404159,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Your opposition to the statement that AV is more proportional to FPTP is purely based on this logic:

&gt;I cannot accept that any system that can produce less representative results under far from unusual circumstances can ever be described as anything approaching a more proportional voting system. 

So you're judging a system purely based on a possible outcome under unusual circumstances that would rarely happen. So why aren't you judging FPTP by the same criteria? It's possible for the FPTP system to represent the possible vote, so why aren't you judging it against that? It's how you're judging AV. 

&gt; They're both rubbish in that regard. Although AV allows electors to show preferences in selecting their local representative, I think you are massively overplaying the impact this will have on the national vote, and its levels of representation of how people voted.

I don't think I am, there's plenty of evidence to suggest that as tactical voting would no longer be an issue, smaller parties (or rather, the ""big"" small parties) are likely to perform better. We've already seen for ourselves how our FPTP system can easily produce coalition or minority governments, if AV shifts even a small portion of seats away from the main 2 parties and towards the Lib Dems, UKIP, SNP, whoever, then it makes the Parliament more representative of the popular vote, and more likely to produce coalitions.

&gt;Oh hunny, if you think so &lt;3

You really are irritating. I took it from the article which I already attached higher up in the thread, which is what I am suggesting should be revisited as and alternative to your policy and which you are supposed to be arguing against, even though you haven't bothered to read it.

&gt;They live in Britain. It would be hard to convince anyone that their worldview was the only one. Obviously, something else is going on. Something you don't understand.

It is very easy to avoid people if you don't do anything with them. Taking classes together is completely different to just living in the same country.

&gt;This is absolutely mad! So, treating everyone the same regardless of religion is somehow intolerant now? Equality in education is intolerant? Saying to a child, sorry, only x percentage of your kind are allowed at this school is tolerant? What kind of bizarre backwards logic is that?

not what I said

&gt;But somehow not funding religious schools through taxes makes it legit?

It will lend it the support of many more people.

&gt;Good selective schools get good grades. That's not some magical miracle that only religious schools are capable of, especially as many of them (Anglican) are barely actually religious and more culturally religious. Good grammar schools were just as good.

Ok. When you find a way to get grammar schools back, I'll be fine with getting rid of faith schools. Until then I say preserve what we still have.

&gt;Not being religious is not the same thing as being atheist. Your definition is so far off the mark, I don't know what to say. Maybe try to understand the very basics of something to avoid showing how little you know.

Whatever. 

&gt;Your little paragraph reveals a lot about your views. It uncovers a hysterical, paranoid persecution complex. Which I think is at the heart of your strong fondness for religious schools despite the evidence for their use in creating division and radicalising people.

whatever.

&gt;I disagree. You see, what's funny about Christian hypocrisy is how easily it is uncovered. Take ""harmless"" prayers to Jesus. Now, note how quickly the same people lose it when those prayers become Islamic prayers. All of a sudden, they don't want their children praying to Allah. Somehow changing just the name alters whether it's harmless or not.
You know what happens when muslim children are encouraged to ""harmlessly"" pray to Jesus? Their parents move them into islamic schools. It unnecessarily encourages more division and makes them more susceptible to radical Islam. The very problem which has to be tackled.

This is just bullshit. sorry. Find me an example of UK Christians ""losing it"" and taking their children out of a school.

&gt;You know what happens when muslim children are encouraged to ""harmlessly"" pray to Jesus? Their parents move them into islamic schools. It unnecessarily encourages more division and makes them more susceptible to radical Islam. The very problem which has to be tackled.
&gt;Why allow the problem to develop in the first place? Why not easily and effectively prevent the problem, instead of managing damage control? Is it really worth all the trouble not to mention all the money wasted?

Come on. ""Easy and effective""?! Take away faith schools and you will just get groups in the mainstream schools who react to this by refusing to interact. You say so many wild things I begin to think you are just trolling and for someone who wants to foster tolerance you are pretty unprepared to listen to views that differ from yours. 
You clearly want to abolish faith schools. Fine. 


There are 13 state funded Islamic faith schools, some of which clearly have problems. I'm sorry but it is just absurd to suggest that this is a basis to shut down *all* faith schools.
Why not just come out and say that you think faith schools should close because religion is simply a bad thing? If the argument is strong then it will prevail, no?

UKIP is fully committed to protecting the rights of
disabled people, as set out in Article 19 of the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities.
We wholly endorse the right of the disabled to access inhome,
residential and community support services and
we support their inclusion in our communities. We also
recognise that there will always be disabled people who are
unable to work and we are committed to supporting them
through a fair and fit-for-purpose welfare system.

We will end unfair ATOS-style Work Capability Assessments and return
assessments to GPs or appropriate specialist consultants, who have full
access to patients’ medical records and are likely to know the patient. We
believe this makes them the best person to undertake assessments and we
will ensure they are adequately funded and resourced to take on this task.

 We will also:
•	 Require GPs/specialists to notify the Department for
Work and Pensions when they believe a patient is well
enough to return to work, by issuing a ‘fit note’
•	 Remove ‘tick-box’ and quota arrangements from
sickness and disability assessments, thereby
streamlining and speeding up the assessment
processes and continually respecting claimants
throughout the process

Yes, there are quite strict money laundering regulations which means banks tend to want good evidence of your identity and residence which can be tricky if you've just moved into the country.  Anecdotally I've heard Lloyds can be better than most in this regard but I've no direct experience.

&gt; How long would it take to get the paperwork sorted and a card running ? (I think that you guys don't rely as heavily on us as checkbooks)

Personal cheques are very rarely used in the UK by most people.  Debit or credit cards all the way, with direct debits and online payment for regular bills.

Anywhere half way decent should be able to get you up and running with an account and a card in a few days.

&gt; Just low fixed monthly fees (if the fees are too random it makes it hard to budget in my monthly spendings) and a card to pay for groceries / internet purchases

As already mentioned most UK current accounts are free provided you stay in credit - the exceptions tend to be ""premium"" accounts with extra features you won't want/need.

But you ignored my points.  What difference does that percentage make effectively? What happens exactly when the percentage changes from 20% to 25%?

Surely, 50% non-muslims would be more preferable? In that case, why even bother with a muslim school at all?

&gt;It is very easy to avoid people if you don't do anything with them. 

Avoiding people is one thing, convincing them that Islam ""is the only worldview"" is one hell of a trick in a country so non-religious (by your own statements).  We're not talking about people living in the middle of nowhere.  It would be like convincing them that white people didn't exist.  It's beyond crazy.

&gt;not what I said

Oh, was it not what you implied either?

&gt;It will lend it the support of many more people.

How?  Explain it.  How would rational people think it's more intolerant for all children to be treated equally and get the same education, especially in by your words a majority atheist country where theists are mocked even at work?  How is religious selection more tolerant?

&gt;When you find a way to get grammar schools back, I'll be fine with getting rid of faith schools. Until then I say preserve what we still have.

Wow, so now you concede there are better solutions out there.  And somehow changing schools to grammar schools is some impossible feat that was only possible before Blair took power?  How is it any more impossible than creating a load of academies and religious schools?

&gt;Whatever.

Amazing argument to being shown you don't even understand the basic definitions behind what you argue over.  Is this trolling or simply stupidity?

&gt;This is just bullshit. sorry. Find me an example of UK Christians ""losing it"" and taking their children out of a school.

Oh, so christians would be ok with their children praying to Allah?  And some how I'm the one bullshitting?  Have you ever even heard of blasphemy?  Muslims tend to take that one seriously.

&gt;Take away faith schools and you will just get groups in the mainstream schools who react to this by refusing to interact.

You are the one going on about how Britain is an atheist society where religion gets mocked everywhere including workplaces, but now somehow the same people think not using tax money to fund religious schools is an outrage?  What are you smoking?

&gt;You say so many wild things I begin to think you are just trolling

Talk about irony.  Just read through and think logically about what I've highlighted, avoid the childish temptation to simply dismiss things you don't like with a ""whatever"" this time.

&gt;for someone who wants to foster tolerance you are pretty unprepared to listen to views that differ from yours

I clearly am listening and countering what you say.  Apparently, in your vocabulary, highlighting the illogical and self-contradictory points you make is not listening.

&gt;You clearly want to abolish faith schools. Fine. There are 13 state funded Islamic faith schools, some of which clearly have problems. I'm sorry but it is just absurd to suggest that this is a basis to shut down all faith schools. Why not just come out and say that you think faith schools should close because religion is simply a bad thing?

There is simply no way to just shut down publically funded schools of one single religion.  It would be blatant discrimination and would likely incur law suits.  The division doesn't just affect muslims.  Many jews are also segregated from other communities.  Eliminating religious schools will easily and effectively help turn Britain into a less divided and more cohesive society.  An easy effective prevention is better than a difficult and ineffective control. Clearly, regulating Islamic schools doesn't work well, even under the close scrutiny that exists in Britain.  It would greatly help stem religious radicalisation.  It would also help spread tolerance, it won't matter what religion you or your parents adhere to.  It would also save money.  So, many good reasons.

You simply have no good reason to help perpetuate religious schools in Britain.  You hold paranoid views about the supposed persecution that religious people undergo.  I think that irrational view fuels your inability to see what is so clear argued by me.

I think a lot of injuries could be expected when your top stars play around 50 games a season, and then summer break is not enough to have a good rest.

There is a physical limit, and of course if you play demanding gegenpressing system, you have to rotate a lot. I think we should manage our players fitness carefully and have a relatively large quality squad, so even our stars like Aguero don't have to play all the games. Younger players will still have their chance, its just that Klopp's football requires a bit larger first team squad.

Well no, because the level of risk presented by someone having a 0.01 BAC is relatively miniscule. It's not worth the police/court resources to deal with and the punishment (ie, banning from the road) wouldn't fit the crime.

&gt; Studies also show having a passenger or being old diminishes reaction time.
Ban it. Ban everything.
Common sense.

No, because the benefits (reduced vehicle deaths) would be far inferior to the drawbacks - families unable to travel together, the elderly having less freedom of movement etc, although I would support mandatory medicals beyond the age of 65.

The only drawback from the reduced maximum legal BAC is that people can't have a pint with lunch and then drive. Boo fucking hoo. The limit has to be set somewhere and 0.05 seems fairly sensible.

 [**Georgism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;__Georgism__ (also known as __geoism__ and __geonomics__) is an economic philosophy holding that the economic value derived from [natural resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_(economics\)) and [natural opportunities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons) should belong equally to all residents of a community, but that people own the value they create.    The Georgist paradigm offers solutions to social and ecological problems, relying on principles of land rights and public finance which attempt to integrate economic efficiency with social justice.  

&gt;Georgism is concerned with the just distribution of [economic rent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_rent) caused by [natural monopolies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopolies), [pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution), and the control of [commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons), including [title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_(property\)) over [natural resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resources) and other contrived [privileges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_(legal_ethics\)) (e.g., [intellectual property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property)). Any natural resource, which is inherently limited in [supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_(economics\)), can generate [economic rent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_rent), but the classical and most significant example of 'land monopoly' involves the extraction of common [ground rent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_rent) from the value of urban and agricultural locations.

&gt;Georgists argue that taxing economic rent derived from land and natural resources is [efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency), [fair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice), and [equitable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(economics\)). The main Georgist policy tool is a fee assessed on location value, often referred to as a [land value tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax) (LVT). Georgists argue that [socially captured rents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_capture) can reduce or eliminate existing taxes on labor and investment that are unfair or inefficient. Some Georgists also advocate for the return of surplus public revenue collected from economic rent back to the people through a [basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income) or [citizen's dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen%27s_dividend). Economists since [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith) have observed that, unlike other taxes, a land value tax would not cause any [economic inefficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadweight_loss) and even stimulates economic activity.  A land value tax is often said to have [progressive tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax) effects, in that it is paid primarily by the wealthy without being passed on to tenants.   Land value capture would reduce [economic inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality), increase wages, remove incentives to misuse real estate, and reduce the vulnerability that economies face from credit and property bubbles. 

&gt;The philosophical basis of Georgism dates back to several early proponents such as [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke)  and [Baruch Spinoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza),  but the concept of gaining public revenues from [natural resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_(economics\)) privileges was widely popularized by the economist and social reformer [Henry George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George) and his first book, *[Progress and Poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_and_Poverty). *

&gt;Georgist ideas were popular and influential in the earlier part of the 20th century.  Political parties, institutions and communities were founded based on Georgist principles during that time. Early followers of George's philosophy called themselves *Single Taxers*, associated with the idea raising public revenue exclusively from land and privileges, but the term is considered a misnomer because Georgists do not consider their proposals to be true taxes and they usually support multiple funding mechanisms. In classical and Georgist economics, the term 'land' is defined as all locations, natural opportunities, resources, physical forces, and government privileges over economic domains, which is closely related to the concept of [commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons).  *Georgism* was coined later, and some prefer the term *geoism* or *geonomics* to distinguish their beliefs from those of Henry George.  instead.

I know it's horrible when something like this happens, I have been personally effected myself when my best friend tried to kill himself after taking these and then passed away soon afterwards in hospital.

With that being said making drugs illegal does not make them go away. It simply pushes them into the black market which is run by violent gangs. It takes people who are simply addicted to them, which should be treated as a health issue, and turns them into criminals. If you can do something that doesn't harm anyone else it should not be illegal. The government, or anyone else for that matter, should not have sovereignty over your own consciousness.

In regards to legal highs in particular, they are impossible to outlaw. If the government outlaws one the producers simply change a molecule and it's technically a different drug. It's a never ending game of whack a mole that can't be won. Also the initial idea behind these drugs was to create safer alternative to dangerous drugs such as meth or heroin. If anyone doesn't watch it, I highly recommend the HBO show 'Vice' who did a recent episode about these very drugs. If these drugs are outlawed any regulation that exists overseeing the process will vanish and much more dangerous ones will become available. Keeping them legal and highly regulated not only makes them safer but can also help the economy by taxing them, creating jobs etc.

Our social media isn't half-bad, and they should be pursuing that as the distribution for content rather than a full broadcast channel.

A few months later when Thatcher became PM, the ex-Ambassador tried to ring to organise asylum for the Shah.  By then Thatcher had been told of the multi-billion pound arms deal with the new regime and how it would be cancelled if the Shah was in Britain.  She never returned the calls.

null,false,Gh0zTFaCe,null,null,null,"I totally agree. By saying it was his project was that he builded this squad, and if we get a new manager he will rebuild it after a season where we got what? 10 new players? Most of them young players who needed to learn a system, new teammates, and play at the highest level many of them for the first time in their career on a weekly basis.

The only thing Rodgers suffers from was almost winning the league last season. I hoped we would be contenders but winning the league with the likes of city, chelsea and arsenal, who all have stronger squads(this season),  and a waaay more experienced squad, is naive.

Its not that i think we have had a succesful season. Not at all. I just don't think you could expect anything else. You can't rebuild a squad around upcoming youngsters, and hope to compete with the very best. If anything i am impressed how many of them have stepped up, in a new way to play midway through the season.

Maybe i just look at it in a different way. I don't look at the table when i evaulate. I look at how we have progressed through the season, and if we keep building on to that progress, we are not far away from being contenders again.

And yes. Klopp has done a fantastic job at Dortmund. I am honestly a very big fan, and IF Rodgers should be replaced, he would obviously be the first to call. I am just afraid of what would happen to all the players that just got the chemistry, and the new system, trying to learn a new managers ideas(wich takes time). Then he would probably get rid of players he didn't like, and get even more new players in.

Im just not a fan of changing things, that is a perspective in. Because changes takes time, and its not guaranteed it would work for the better.

null,false,TrickyDickNixonbot,,Labour Member,null,"&gt; The price freeze is definitely supposed to be an opportunity to 'fix' the energy market in some way, and will definitely include giving Ofgem more powers. 

Well the general idea is to create a new, more powerful regulator to replace Ofgem. I've heard this could take the form of the East Asian model where all the companies are brought together onto a board and the government sets out the general plans and targets which they're compelled to obey via a variety of strategies. The form fixing the energy market will take is certainly going to be interesting either way!

&gt; Public support for fixing that particular market is high, including strong support for total or partial renationalisation, so yes, it's possible, but I think it's an outside chance that Labour will go strong on the public route.

Hmmm, im concerned about the cost of running the energy sector while trying to reduce the deficit though. If we're gonna go down the public path, a state-owned corporation might be the best option until we have a surplus, then we can (this is my ideal scenario of course) bring back the old energy model from before the Thatcher Era of total public control and integration. Some other interesting ideas would be cooperatively-owned energy, or municipalised energy that would give local councils more control over their services.

&gt; There was a good interview with Chuka in the New Statesman, which I was going to post here, but their website's gone down. He was definitely strong on the idea of manufacturing competitiveness and had a great line on being progressive about deficit reduction: 'There's nothing progressive about spending more on debt repayments than we do on housing'. It was very much that Blair thing of 'We're not doing the ""right-wing sounding but popular thing"" because we have to; we're doing it because it's the right thing to do'.

Do post when you can! I haven't seen it/read it. I wholly agree about the deficit and the cuts, as much as I hate to pull a TINA, there has to be cuts in some way or another and we're doing it because its the right thing to do right now, however, we're going to do it in a non-ideological and correct way, unlike the Tories who'll just use it as an excuse to hack off disproportionately large amounts of the public sector for the sake of advancing Thatcherism.",null,0,null,1429111988,null,0,false,0,cqd7lgx,null,t3_32la95,null,t1_cqd7lgx,null,t1_cqd5ybk,null,null,null,1432405556,null,2,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

It's around 300 quid a month on benefits. Nice right? THREE HUNDRED QUID! 

Except? This is only a large sum of money if you are a 15 year old kid who thinks work is boring and just chores. Let us say you are buying food. That 300 quid will evaporate. I spend between 50 to 80 quid a week on food (when I was in the UK) and I cook everything. The HIGHEST you can earn with maximum benefits is 500 quid a month. Even that is not as large as people think it is. 

It's frankly not a lot of money, not compared to working. Even minimum wage out earns that. 300 pounds vs nearly a 1000. And you do have expenditures in order to get that £500 so it's not £500 cleanly but let's take it as that. If you simply worked a minimum wage job you would walk off with double the amount of money. Anjem betrays his Islamic heritage by demonstrating a catastrophic inability to grasp algebra. £1000&gt;£500. 

More? Well. I picked crazy work. And my crazy ass job taught me to read sources. 

1. Most Muslim Immigrants to the UK brought wives from back ""home"". Possibly cause they didn't have anything in common with the locals and possibly because their families arranged the marriages. Remember, men are just as trapped in that system as women if they want acceptability. So they got some villager wife who doesn't speak English to come over to marry them. 

2. The only difference between them is that demographically they have a high percentage of stay at home wives. 
But what's the issue? The issue is that they don't speak English. They got in by marrying someone who lives in the UK. ""The first big finding is that 57% of the women asked would like to have a paid job. Quilliam sees it this way round, rather than that 39% would not like to. Either way, this figure suggests that roughly twice as many women would like to work outside the home as actually do so. Their aspirations are not middle class. Only one in eight want either a professional career or to own their own business and only 0.3% (two women) said they wanted a job in order to have a career."" As they article says. The issue is that they DO want to work. Not that there is some mad Islamic Plot to not work. Cause I work with Muslim women. 

3. It also tells us the cause. ""No, the overwhelming answer, given by nearly half the respondents, was that they had to bring up their children. Another 20% said that their English wasn't very good, and this is a point that Quilliam takes up, believing that English lessons for immigrant wives are essential to integrate them into society and that it is foolish and short-sighted to cut back on funding for that."" Surprisingly Anjem Choudhary doesn't figure in. Anjem Choudhary is just the Brown Person equivalent of Nick Griffin. Dumb as fuck and trashy.

4. I disagree with the second article. ""White people aren't missing out on good jobs"". That implies that there is some sort of positive discrimination towards Indians and Chinese people. What it means is that ""Indians and Chinese people have a huge drive for academic excellence and push their children to achieve often to the detriment of extra-curricular activities. There is also an outright taboo on going into careers that aren't professional without qualifications. These two create a powerful group of well educated, well qualified individuals who get into more career based courses. Not because there is some positive discrimination. In fact? Most Chinese and Indians point out that they actively struggle to find jobs. They just apply all over the place and are so flexible (and their community supports them) making it easier to find a job. Put it this way? If you are looking for a medical job in London and your doctor is a newbie and Asian. Ask them where they live. Most will say Eastham. The South Asian community actively feeds people at it's temples and gurudwaras to help them out. Chill, Temple and Gurudwaras are open to everyone. You can eat there too. It's clearly glossing over how different Asian culture is with regards to work. Oh and Indian Muslims work too. The issue is poverty. 

Imagine if you will, taking white people from a housing estate and comparing them to some Jews. That's the issue. We are quietly cutting out the hard workers from that demographic in order to pain them all as listening to Anjem Choudhary when most think he is a cock lord.

You made it sound like they don't want to work. I could easily find some yobs going on about not working and having a laugh but in the greater context of things they aren't representative. 

The Jihad seeker's allowance malarky is just laughable. I just see it like this....

&gt;

&gt;The __Tank, Infantry, Mk IV (A22)__ was a British [heavy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_tank) [infantry tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry_tank) used in the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), best known for its heavy armour, large longitudinal chassis with all-around tracks with multiple bogies, and its use as the basis of many specialist vehicles. It was one of the heaviest [Allied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II) tanks of the war.

&gt;The origins of the design lay in the expectation that war in Europe might be fought under similar conditions to those of the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War), and emphasized the ability to cross difficult ground. The Churchill was rushed into production to build up British defences against a possible German invasion. The first vehicles had flaws that had to be overcome before the Churchill was accepted for wide use. After several Marks had been built a better armoured version, the Mark VII, entered service.

&gt;The Churchill was used by British and Commonwealth forces in [North Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa_campaign), Italy and North-West Europe. In addition, a few hundred were supplied to the USSR and used on the [Eastern Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II\)).

For dry/ normal skin you could use an AHA or an enzyme exfoliant: I am currently loving the Ishtar Skinlights Trizyme Mask. IMO do not use a BHA which tends to be very drying. Stronger AHAs would mean particular caution over sunscreen since they can be photosensitising.

Vitamin C depends on your routine as well as your skintype. L-ascorbic acid needs to be applied to bare or close to bare skin and left for *at least* fifteen minutes before the next product is applied - cheapest and gentlest is SR Skincare CE ferulic serum being an acid you would also get some light exfoliation which can help with dullness.

null,false,Trosso,null,null,null,"Guys, he had many good years in the Bundesliga and he's definitely a good manager, but is he better than Pellegrini? I'm not so sure. Now before you downvote me  hear me out.

He did fantastic with an underdog club like Dortmund precisely because they're an underdog club. He's on the level of Simeone who motivates players who are always the underdog.

in the premier league, when are we ever exactly the underdog? Most of the time we're favourite to win just about every game, only Chelsea are a team we could be an underdog against. 

He fucked up real hard this season and looks like at best he will come between 6-10th. Can you IMAGINE if we can anywhere in that region? Can you imagine if we were bottom of the prem at Christmas?

I think Klopp is a fantastic manager and builds really good teams and plays exciting football, but he's along the lines of an attack minded Mancini. He's not the holistic manager that the club wants. Does he bring through youth? I don't know if he does. 

He's too emotional, just like Mancini and that's exactly why he's a bad fit for Txiki &amp; co. 

Maybe I am wrong (and hopefully I am if he's appointed) but I'm not sure he's the kind of manager we're looking for. We're looking for Pep at best case scenario otherwise Ancelotti. And while Ancelotti doesn't necessarily play the style of football or have the holistic attitude that we're aiming for, he's a proven winner and motivator of big players. Did it with Milan, PSG, Chelsea and Madrid. You don't get much better than that really.

Now if we do go for Klopp, I'm sure he will be a success and will play exciting football. We will also gut a lot of our lazy players (Dortmund play high pressing counter attacking football I think?) which is great, but will we have enough money and is he a big enough name to attract the talent we want?

A party that continually gets 20% of the vote but never gets more than 5% representation isn't fair democratically either, particularly if they are a middle ground.

null,false,Casaubon_is_a_bitch,eng-lincolnshire,Lincoln,null,"&gt;Nationalism is a belief, creed or political ideology that involves an individual identifying with, or becoming attached to, one's nation. 

&gt;National identity is not an inborn trait; various studies have shown that a person's national identity results directly from the presence of elements from the ""common points"" in people's daily lives: national symbols, language, national colours, the nation's history, national consciousness, blood ties, culture, music, cuisine, radio, television, etc.

&gt;National identity is a person's identity and sense of belonging to one state or to one nation, a feeling one shares with a group of people, regardless of one's citizenship status. Many professors see national identity in psychological terms as ""an awareness of difference"" - ""a feeling and recognition of 'we' and 'they'""

There are interesting similarities between the two in that both have a central set of tenets, a constitution created from codified documents, as well as with symbols, language, colours, history, collective consciousness, blood ties, culture, music, radio, television, etc... Except religion isn't limited to geographic boundaries, and espouses a transcendental connection with a deity, a deep belief in ""an awareness of difference"" - ""a feeling and recognition of 'we' and 'they'. 

As for 'how would you kill in the name of it', there's been plenty of examples. IRA &amp; ETA to name two off the top of my head.

The Tories got most seats.

no other combination of parties could have produced a majority.

the only options in that situation were:

a ConLib coalition - where the LibDems get to enact some of their policies and rein back the excesses of the Tories

A Con minority govt, with Confidence and Supply from the LibDems - no LibDem policies and the Tories get to implement their own policies.

A Con minority govt alone - unstable with a new election called within months and a likely Tory majority resulting.

This was a the height of the financial chaos, threats to the £ and the possibly collapse of the entire banking system.

what should the LibDems have done?

It's seems a **lot** closer to slander than going out and physically raping someone though, surely?  They seem very different things to me, and not ones deserving of exactly the same punishment.

And I'm not sure I'd agree - there are slanderous accusations that can be made that would indeed result in criminal investigation.  Even ones that would be far more likely to result in prison time than in this particular example, where the girl recanted her accusation the next day (which you'll note the judge took into account in the sentence here, among other factors).

And I did mention false accusation of other crimes, which does happen.  Indeed, even much more involved attempts to implicate someone for even more serious crimes (eg. framing someone for murder) which seems worse than a case like this where there's an unsupported accusation and then immediate retraction.

null,false,mrmessiah,null,null,null,"The Tories pretty much as far back as you want to look create policy that benefits the rich at the expense of the poor, but somehow manage to frame it in a way that looks as if they're doing the opposite. This interview shows a couple of examples of this. 

They're talking about right to buy, and the headline is that people will be able to get on the property ladder by owning the property they're living in. As Boulton points out, the people living in those properties are very unlikely to be able to afford them - just like the original right to buy scheme, rich landlords (in the 80s, this included the Tory politicians that voted in the scheme) will be the ones buying the properties and then using them as rental assets. The people living in them are no better off, and the rental money goes into private hands. Plus, at a time we need to be building a whole lot more social housing, we're depleting the stock. For now, the pro-Tory papers get to crow about what a wonderful thing it is that people can now own their own homes. Any lack of building social housing in the present day is handwaved over as an unfortunate mistake, just like in years to come, once the people who were taken in by the headlines are no better off, the stock getting bought up by capitalists will be glossed over, as they deflect the discussion onto the government of the day and what *they're* doing to build social housing. 

Same with the other conversation. Both Boulton and Gove know full well that a person on those hours is going to be worse off after you take into account the freeze in benefits - what they're giving doesn't make up for what they're losing. Gove just has to deflect around that fact, which he does, and hope enough people don't read the small print till after the election.

These aren't failures of policy - a policy is only a failure if you believe the reason for it existing is the reason they say it exists. These policies do *exactly* what they're meant to do, and all they need to do is keep putting slippery mouthpieces like Gove behind them, splash the headlines over the Murdoch press and they know they can get away with it. They've done it again and again and again and they'll never stop doing it.

I had a THL W200 and when I ""upgraded"" to a Moto G I was quite disappointed - the THL was slimmer, more pleasant to use and had less crapware. 

In my case the camera on the new Moto G doesn't seem as good as that on the THL, and the THL had a removable battery - I bought a spare for about £5.

The only reason I upgraded from my last THL after a year was that it ran Android 4.2 with no anticipated upgrade.

I think it's expected that none of the current Chinese phones with MTK-whatever chipsets (Mediatek?) will ever get Android higher than 4.4. 

When I bought the Moto G it was already running 4.4, but it was promised 5.0, which installed recently as an OTA upgrade.

I'm sure there was some reason I wanted the newer version of Android, but I honestly can't remember why now, or any important differences. I think Android 5.0 backs up your photos to Google Plus, but the Gallery was fractionally nicer on the THL and the Motorola crapware nagged annoyingly until I disabled it.

My mother has a 6"" THL phone and the larger screen is a godsend - she uses it for everything now, and says she'll never buy another laptop.

null,false,Kitchner,null,null,null,"&gt;A party that continually gets 20% of the vote but never gets more than 5% representation isn't fair democratically either

If we assume it was a direct democracy a 20% of the vote would get you the same as a 5% share i.e. nothing. You're not the majority so you don't get to decide.

Realistically, assuming the majorities stayed the same what does it matter if they had 5% of the seats or 20% of the seats? It only makes a difference if they are in a coalition, which comes to the problem of a minority party being in power constantly.

&gt;If the electorate is split between left and right, with a middle-ground party getting a good chunk of the votes, should we not be entitled to drag policy into the middle ground, rather than continually lurch between two extremes?

Why should it? What if UKIP becomes the third largest party, so it's not the centre anymore, do you think all parties should have their policies dragged to the right?

I don't vote Lib Dem because I don't agree with their policies, yet without fail every 5 years their party would influence the laws of this country. Why should they have the right to ""drag"" policies towards the centre? Especially when one of the criticisms of UK politics is it's too centerist.

&gt;What about the fact that, up until UKIP, the right's vote has never really been split in this country. You end up with a large number of generally left wing parties all getting obliterated in representation, allowing the seat to be taken by the right. Is the solution to remove choice so people can only vote for the two ""most major"" parties so we at least get the left/right split correct?

You do understand that Labour only existed as the second major party after 1945 yes? Prior to that it was the Liberals and the Tories. Over time people moved away from the Liberals towards Labour, demographics and attitudes changed and eventually people shifted.

The British political system has already shown that parties that don't adapt die out, and arguably Labour pre-1997 was close to dying out. The fact the Lib Dems threw their 50 years of hard work away by getting into coalition with the tories is irrelevant. If there ever was a segment of the political spectrum that was shattered into minor parties, they would either form coalitions or they would merge, as the Liberals and the SDP did.

No, I said they're far closer to slander than to rape.  Do you really disagree?  You really think an action involving maliciously giving false information the police is *literally* more akin to going out and forcibly raping someone than maliciously giving false information to someone else?

&gt;I'm pretty sure if I called the police and told them someone was slandering me they wouldn't go and immediately arrest the person I accused

There have certainly been instances of slanderous accusations that have prompted police investigations and arrests.

&gt;

&gt;The __Karaiskakis Stadium disaster__ was an incident that occurred on 8 February 1981,  in the [Karaiskakis Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaiskakis_Stadium) in Neo [Faliro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faliro), [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens), [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece), after the conclusion of a football match between [Olympiacos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos_F.C.) and [AEK Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEK_Athens_FC). It is the biggest football [tragedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_(event\)) in Greece's history,  and among the worst in sports history.

&gt;A total number of 21 people, 20 supporters of [Olympiacos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos) and 1 supporter of [AEK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEK_Athens_F.C.), lost their lives while rushing out of the stadium to celebrate the victory of [Olympiacos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos_F.C.) against [AEK Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEK_Athens_FC) (6–0). The accident occurred in the historic Gate 7 (Θύρα 7).  The stadium has since been rebuilt as a modern football field (not a stadium).

&gt;There are still debates regarding the causes that led to the disaster. The main cause for the accident, according to the official police report, seems to have been a partially closed door. While exiting, some fans lost their balance and fell on the last steps. Dozens fell onto each other and were stepped over by a horde of unsuspecting fans who kept coming, making it for most of them extremely difficult to stand up or even defend themselves somehow. 19 supporters lost their lives within the stadium, while another two died of their wounds in hospital. At least 55 more were injured, many of them with major injuries. Most of the dead and wounded were teenagers and young adults.

Have a read of some of these with special attention to Krugman;

&gt;Part of this is the growth rate fallacy — no matter how badly an economy has done over an extended period, you proclaim success after a year or two of good growth. As Wren-Lewis likes to say, on this basis the ideal policy is to shut half the economy down for a while, then start it up again — that way you get 100 percent growth. 

Saying we have fastest growth in G20 is firstly factually incorrect as China is part of the G20. The Tory party line is fastest growth in any industrialized country and it makes little economic sense as you can tell by Krugman's quote. The Tories wrecked the economy in the first 2 years and then when it is growing after they wrecked it they take credit.

They believe welfare to be completely ineffective at destroying poverty, and that the most effective way of reducing poverty in history has been private enterprise. Just because they take money out of welfare doesn't mean that wealth just disappears; it's goes into everyone's pockets and more importantly it goes into private investors.  It's not the tax breaks that will make people better; it's the resultant increase in the freedom in a market and the resulting investment. It's a very complicated issue and just disingenuously assuming 'oh they hate the poor yeah they must be wrong!'  only serves to make you look like the incompetent one.  The importance of free markets in reducing is explained beautifully by Milton Friedman and it's very friendly to newcomers to economics.

Some people simply don't have the time and/or patience to go through changing *any* of their utility or service provisions. 

I'll grant you doing that nowadays is easier than many people imagine, but there are still potential pitfalls – e.g. one or more aspects of a switchover not going to plan or the new product/service not being quite what was expected/hoped for – and the prospect of having to deal with things like that can certainly be daunting enough to put people off.

Economies of scale have absolutely *nothing* to do with it. Their senators and representatives win the votes lottery if they can secure a juicy military contract in their state. They also, happily, are the ones who tell the manufacturer where to build the assembly line, and tell the military what to buy and for what price. Even if the military has no need or even desire to do so. *Because the military has almost no say in the buying process*.

So the state which has the factory wins, the congressman wins, and the military just spent a few hundred million on stuff that'll never leave the warehouse it's delivered to. And repeat. A senator has a navy yard in his constituency. BING! the navy is forced to keep 3 Frigates in an operational condition. They wanted to scrap them, but they have no say in the matter. So the navy yard stays open to house the frigates. The town is saved, votes votes votes.

For three years now, the Pentagon has been begging Congress to stop buying more tanks. They already have 9,000. They want to reduce the number. But Congress wants to keep the factories open, so they just voted for $183 million to buy more tanks. Last year it was $120 million to upgrade tanks when they already have new better ones rusting in storage. It's madness.

That's not really what's being talked about here, though - contracts which come with a ""free"" phone are very obviously overpriced, specifically to spread the cost of a £300+ handset over 12 or 18 instalments.

Getting a SIM only, pay monthly contract from your current provider will probably save you £20, the problem is that you have to resist the temptation to get another new ""free"" iPhone.

You can withdraw usually up to £150 over your limit without it being refused. Then of course you are charged. But there is not one charge but a charge of £22 (at least it was) for every single time you use that anticipated overdraft. So a withdrawal of £10 over what you have in credit would actually be £32. What's more that £22 charge does not come out straight away but a month and a half later. So even though they do send you a letter many times people forget and then the charge puts them back into the anticipated overdraft again, causing another usage charge.Now all of this would not actually be that bad, just don't spend more than you have and keep better track of your own money right?

In any case, it sounds like high interest current accounts (and perhaps regular saver accounts, too) are probably your best bet for now, if you qualify for them. You typically need a couple of direct debits for these high interest current accounts and need to fund them with a certain amount per month, but you can still use another account as your ""real"" current account and (usually) just transfer the money in there by standing order or whatever. (If you can't make the monthly funding amount, setting up standing orders to transfer the same £x between that account and an account with a different bank normally works.) 

The 123 account only gives you the full 3% if you have at 3k in there (but goes up to 20k). I think Club Lloyds accounts give 5% on a much smaller limit (0 to 2.5k?) so might be a better option for smaller amounts?

Dortmund's current season is an anomaly under Klopp's tenure.

They won the Bundesliga twice in his 7 years there, competing with this Bayern Munich side - on a fraction of the budget. He also reached a Champions League final and narrowly missed out to a Bayern side that smashed almost 10 goals past Barcelona over two legs.

He's a great tactician, while having the ability to inspire his side and win their loyalty. He's proven himself capable of creating a great team ethic and introducing academy players into a successful side.

And this is all while many of his best players have been shipped out to rivals for big money.

He is the real deal.

The only question mark is his ability to adapt, and do it at another club. He'd be more of a gamble than Guardiola for example, but then again every single manager in the game would be - bar Mourinho.

He is the outstanding candidate at the moment, particularly given his ability to reshape a side - which is precisely what we need.

We need a visionary. The only two managers who really fit that bill are Klopp and Guardiola.

If we turn our noses up at Klopp and stick with Pellegrini for a year, in the hope that Guardiola may take over here once his contract expires at Bayern, then Txiki and Soriano are batshit insane IMO.

Next season would be an absolute write off in that scenario.

The only way I could stomach us not being in for Klopp was if we had some kind of cast iron guarantee with Guardiola that he'd take the job in a year, and I find such a guarantee highly unlikely at best - this is football we're talking about.

The only other scenario would be sacking Pellegrini for a year and appointing a manager on an intermediary basis on a one year contract. Sabella may fit that bill, as he's been linked recently.

But that is a hugely risky scenario, and isn't conductive to a stable environment for a competitive football club at the highest level.

Appointing Klopp would effectively mean giving up on Guardiola, and I think that's where the reticence may be given Guardiola is Txiki's dream appointment (and mine). The plan appeared to be to have Pellegrini's contract expire at the same time as Guardiola's at Bayern, and then try and lure him to England (given he'd like to manage in the PL, and has worked with Txiki and Soriano before), there may have even been a gentleman's agreement, we can only speculate. Pellegrini however has thrown that plan into the bin with an utterly woeful season, overseeing a staggering regression, making his replacement, IMO, a necessity. The problem, of course, is that would mean our chances of Guardiola in 2016 would evaporate unless we appointed a stop-gap manager.

And can we afford to do that?

Should we gamble so much on it?

Klopp is a very talented manager, who could be an ideal fit for us. He'd be our first real top shelf manager IMO, you only need to look at the reaction of rival fans to see how highly Klopp is rated.

We'd be utterly fucking batshit not to at least consider appointing him. If we turned our noses up at him this summer, appointed a so-so manager on a short term basis and then didn't get Guardiola in a year there would be fucking mutiny among the supporters against the current Spanish hierarchy.

This is an appointment we have to get right. Not only our short term, but our medium to longterm future is dependant on it.

This seems to be fairly sensible. Social housing is in short supply, if the councils are sitting on properties which have become very valuable,  it makes sense to sell them. They can presumably use the money to build *more* houses than they sold, in areas where land is less expensive, especially if the build smaller properties for singles and couples.

That's why nobody implements a actual free market system and if want a famous example then look at J.K Rowling.

Without knowing the full facts, it's impossible to say what led to this young man's death - it could have been using too much, mixing with other substances, or an allergic type reaction. All of these issues could be minimised by providing honest education and regulating the market carefully.

If young people choose to use drugs, they can source them. Currently they have two choices: go to a dealer or buy something being sold as a research chemical. Neither approach allows for harm minimisation principles to be applied, such as dosage advice (a dealer actually might be safer in this scenario, but obviously there are no safeguards there.)

Ending prohibition isn't about starting a free for all and telling everyone to go and use drugs. It's about taking a pragmatic approach to a problem that law enforcement alone has failed to address properly. When legislation comes in to remove these products from the shelves, and it definitely will, it will just reinforce the control that criminals have on this market, and increase the risk - this is exactly.what happened in Ireland when they brought in their 'ban'. The perverse part is that usage of novel psychoactive drugs has actually risen there since they were taken off the shelves, but now it is a trade that we can't we can't even see or get an estimate of.

Sami Khedira 

Yehven Konoplyanka

James Milner

Andrea Ranocchia

Andre Ayew

Dani Alves

Ignazio Abate

Andre-Pierre Gignac

Danny Ings

Nigel De Jong

Glen Johnson

Ron Vlaar

Maxi Pereira


We should forget about who on that list we could get and concentrate instead on who we should be going for.

First order of business for the summer is an established 20 goal a season striker. That rules out Danny Ings, he's not good enough and never will be. Gignac is a good player but he's 29 now and has never played outside of France. I don't think he is the striker that we need.

Next pressing need is a central midfielder. Sami Khedira is world class and we should be going all out to get him. We probably won't but we definitely won't if we don't try :) Nigel de Jong would be a great alternative to Khedira. He's 30, so not a spring chicken, but still a fantastic footballer. His experience would be invaluable, would be a great signing.
I really like Milner and think he'd be a great squad player for us. If we can get him on cheap enough wages we should go for it. 

Next up is full back, especially as Glen Johnson is on this list! We need a new right back, Manquillo is on loan and Flanagan has missed a whole season. 

Abate is decent, not very fast but a solid defender. Maxi Pereira is would suit our style better. Both are better than what we have but should be aiming higher and younger. Nathaniel Clyne is my No. 1 choice. If we can't get someone like that then one of these would be a good stop-gap solution. Dani Alves would be good for a season or two as well but his wages would be a problem.

Centre back next. If we are going to play 3 at the back next season we will need another central defender, especially with Kolo nearing the end of his career. Ranocchia would be an excellent signing. He's good in the air, great tackler, quick and can play the ball out of defense. Ideal for us. Vlaar, not so much.

Wingers. We're stocked. Don't really need another winger unless Raheem leaves. Out of the ones on the list, Konoplyanka and Ayew, I would go for Ayew. He's more productive and he can play on a lot of positions including midfield and up front. So he's got versatility going for him. I think he'd fit in well to our system.

There's some good players on this list. If we could get a couple of these in key positions along with a top class striker this summer it would be some excellent business.

null,false,CallMeLarry,null,null,null,"There are a few places, the Boots up by the Bullring (can't remember the streetname but it's the one with two floors, near Brantano and CEX) does one roll of 24 frames in an hour for £7.99 with 6x4 gloss prints and negative scans on a CD. The photo department is downstairs near the NHS walk-in centre.

Jessops are a bit more expensive but offer gloss or lustre paper if I remember correctly. They're about £7.99/24 frames in an hour *without* a CD, then you pay about £2 for a CD.

Snappy Snaps (next to Ask Italian) is the most expensive high street developer but will give the highest quality scans and a slightly wider range of papers. I should say that all three use the same paper to print on (Fuji Crystal Archive) and probably the same printers/developers so you're really paying for the quality of the scans and the options for Gloss/Lustre/Matt.

There's also Palm Studios in Digbeth which is a proper pro photo lab. they're by far the most expensive (I think about £6.99 for *just development*, no scans or prints) but they offer a wide range of film formats, paper options, scan resolutions (scanning a roll of film at high quality will cost you something like £8 on its own but I imagine they'll get the best results out of it). They'll also do enlargements, either by scanning and printing or actual hand-done darkroom enlargements, but you're looking at around £20 for a set of three 8x10s there. If you begin looking into push- and pull-development, they're the only place that will do it. They are the only place I've yet to try due to my limited student funds.

If it helps, I've been using Boots pretty much all the time. Snappy Snaps and Jessops are too pricey for me, especially since the results are about the same. The scans are high enough resolution for internet use and if I wanted a super HQ one for enlargements I'd get the individual frame scanned at Palm.

Edit: This information is all for 35mm film, just looked at your post history and saw you shoot a lot of 120.

This is completely alien to Islam which is a total system in which secularism and democracy are anathema.  You are dealing with ideas which cannot be reconciled and which are bound to lead to conflict.

As for globalisation, having global trade relations does not mean we have to take in immigrants who have no cultural affinity to this country whatsoever.  If we are weak it is because we let them blackmail us with the ludicrous Islamophobia charge.  Tell me do you think that Japanese, South Korean and Taiwanese cultures are weak because they have no truck with mass immigration of people who have little loyalty to their adopted country.",null,0,null,1429125212,null,0,false,0,cqdgb4w,null,t3_32nsoy,null,t1_cqdgb4w,null,t1_cqdfp0u,null,null,null,1432409733,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Okay, you know how Hassidic Jews follow ""Jewish Law"" that dictates how they dress and how they keep Kosher? 

That's Shariah Law's Older Brother. Levitical Law. Shariah is another law like that that dictates everything from ""How to wash"" to ""How to Slaughter Animals"" to ""Inheritance"" and ""How to be charitable"" (In fact? This is a pillar of Islam. It's as important as going on Haj and fasting during Ramadan).

To quote your own article...

""40 per cent support the introduction of sharia into British law for Muslims""

Just for Muslims. Why? Because it's how they are expected to live their lives. We won't do it because we think there should be one law for everyone but if you want to sign a legal contract where you screw yourself over of your own free will,  no one's stopping you. I just don't think that it should be a legal reality for all Muslims. 

""a third back the notion of a worldwide Islamic caliphate (state) based on sharia law""

Just like All Catholics back the Soverignity of the Vatican in their daily lives. 

""40 per feel it is unacceptable for Muslim men and women to mix freely""

Nigel Farage went to Dulwich College... A Boys Private School. Are you seriously going to force Muslim men and women to hang out together? The rule is simple. Anyone can mix with anyone freely. If you do not like it then do not mix. It's your choice to join in or not. No one's stopping us from doing anything with the opposite or same gender.

""24 per cent do not think men and women are equal in the eyes of Allah""

Hell 100% of parts of Reddit think the same thing too but we don't run around claiming all of Reddit's like that. 

""a quarter have little or no respect for homosexuals.""

How do you quantify Homophobia? Or respect? I didn't say thank you to a gay man? I called someone ""batty"". Come on, it's such a vague statement. 

Then? I suggest you look into bias. Please read your article and see who framed the questions. Interesting fact, right wing conservatives love to demonise Muslims. 

I also suggest reading the whole sentence next time.

Well, none of those things were true. We were able to purchase our tickets after, so I ran the risk of waiting to not get tickets because if I couldn't get them through the group, they would already be sold out.

Hardly prime if you ask me.

Luckily it all worked out in the end, Some tickets got returned and I was able to get front row seats right by the tunnel for the same price that CIA wanted for their tickets. Took my CFC flag and got signatures from Cech, Lampard, David Luiz, and a few others.

Right. Mate. Not one of us cares about conquering the UK. Seriously? We got jobs that are more important than faffing about dealing with drunken yobs and asbos.

The man above just wants to make his neighbour a bloody cake. Not give him the keys to his car and ask him to make passionate love to his wife/husband/self. 

Sigh... This is embarassing. 

It's Muhajirun. If you are going to use Arabic Terms, at least make sure they are right. What you just said was not ""Migrant"" but ""Exotic Dancer Harun"" which is a bad name for an Exotic Dancer (at least the sort I like) since it's a male name and is the same meaning Aaron which is... warrior lion. So Exotic Dancing Warrior Lions are a great threat to our way of life?

And not one Islamic Fundamentalist group uses that term. The Muhajirun are a historical group of Muslims who migrated from Mecca to Medina to escape persecution during Mohammed's flight from there. There was one pro-Jihad organisation that had this name but it disbanded/changed it's name a bunch of times. 

These ""Migrants"" were named after those famous people, not because they were ACTUAL migrants. That's like calling yourself Plumbic Blimp and playing Led Zep covers and being told that you are some sort of balloon made out of very heavy materials...

And by your logic we should be turfing out Christians and Jews lest they all go crazy and start an Inquisition/Commit Genocide and Rape our Daughters.

&gt; Conservative Election Manifesto 
The Conservatives have continued to spin their familiar yarn of having rescued Britain from ‘Labour’s Great Recession’. This, as they must know, is the mother of all lies. The Great Recession was caused by the banks. Governments, the Labour government included, by bailing out the banks and continuing to spend, stopped the Great Recession from turning into a Great Depression. Yet practically everyone seems to believe that the Great Recession was manufactured by Gordon Brown.
 
&gt;The Conservatives claim that ‘by halving the deficit we have restored confidence to the economy’. This cheerfully ignores the near academic consensus that their deficit-reduction policies over the last 5 years have made the British economy between 5 and 10% smaller than it would have been with more sensible policies.
 
&gt;According to the Conservative manifesto ‘more borrowing – and the extra debt interest that brings – means that there is less money to spend on schools and hospitals’. But if less borrowing reduces the size of the economy – and therefore of government revenues – there will be even less to spend on schools and hospitals.
 
&gt;‘More spending means higher taxes for hardworking people’ – not if it causes the economy to grow more than the spending.
Failure to control the national debt would be a ‘moral failing’ by ‘leaving our children or grandchildren with debts that they could never hope to repay’. How many people realise that over 60% of the holders of British government debt are British residents, for whom it will be an asset to leave to their children and grandchildren?
 
&gt;The Conservative narrative has become the Overton Window of our day, outside of which policies are unthinkable. But sooner or later reality will break in, and what is now unthinkable will become sensible again.

The very idea that I would vote for someone because they had the same colour skin as me or were the same sex I find about as offensive and morally repugnant as it is possible to get.

Also, it is clear that UKIP did have non-white representation in their manifesto by the nature of the question. It absolutely was a cheap shot by virtue of saying ""you don't have enough visible diversity"". If you think it was a valid question I'd have to question your understanding of politics. If UKIP had no non-white representation then perhaps it might be reasonable to ask why not but as they did, to ask ""why not more"" is not journalism, it is provocation. 

If you're a non-white voter and you don't want to vote for a party that doesn't have representation of your ethnicity, you are a racist. This is not to say the views of racists don't matter, of course they do and they can vote the same as everyone else but the hypocrisy of labelling UKIP racist when they aren't and you are is galling at best.",null,1,null,1429128921,null,0,1429131056,0,cqdiszf,null,t3_32o9i7,null,t1_cqdiszf,null,t1_cqd3p2l,null,null,null,1432410978,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Does ""lower their reliance on the state"" just mean reduce tax credits or benefits?  Because for working people that is exactly the same as raising tax.  They may get money back in tax cuts but if people are worse off that can hardly inspire social mobility.  This kind of policy just reduces income redistribution from higher rate tax payers.  I cannot see how that is workable in the long term without reducing income inequality (or destroying welfare/NHS).

null,false,FezojT,null,null,null,"I'm pretty sure the fact that there *isn't* global warming on Mars is part of the reason there are no Martians to speak of. It's a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone, but the lack of an intrinsic magnetic field means the solar wind stripped the planet of its atmosphere, so it has an equilibrium temperature below the freezing point of water (and perhaps more crucially, nothing to breathe). Likewise, we owe our existence on this Earth to the greenhouse effect. That doesn't mean greenhouse gases are good in whatever context, it just means the whole thing in in a tenuous balance and pushing it in one direction or another is probably not a good idea. 

Mars and Jupiter were poor choices. The removal of Mars' atmosphere means it has suffered the exact opposite of global warming (and there is [no evidence to suggest it is currently heating up](http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-on-mars.htm)). Jupiter on the other hand is a gas giant and doesn't really have a definable surface, so is a poor model system to compare the Earth against, and once again, [there is no evidence that is is even warming](https://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-on-jupiter.htm). Venus would have been a much more apt example, [given that it is much warmer than Mercury despite being further away from the sun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runaway_greenhouse_effect#Venus).

I realise I'm preaching to the converted, but I thought it was probably a good idea to make this clear.Who needs dirty foreign scientists muddling the debate with decades of empirical evidence and hard science when in a matter of seconds we can make up our own facts that conveniently fit our agenda?

Chicharito never really got a fair chance at Manchester United (nor Madrid, for that matter). He is a quality player when he's given opportunities and is an elite level poacher. The guy scores more goals from second chances/rebounds/defensive mishaps than anyone. I don't think there are many people on the planet who understand how to find the right spots as well as he does. That's why United valued him so highly as a super sub and why Madrid brought him in on a loan.

We suffer from inconsistent scoring these past few seasons. I have no doubt Chicharito would help quell those concerns, because while he isn't all that technically gifted or much of an all-around threat, he is exceptional at finding space to get accurate shots off. He's also still just entering his prime at 26 years-old.

[Here is a comparison between Chicharito's last three years and our two best forwards this year (Sakho and Carroll)](http://i.imgur.com/vcVAg69.jpg)

As you can see, on a per 90 basis, Chicharito scores at a higher rate and shoots the ball much more accurately than what we currently have to offer. His per 90 numbers overall easily trump Carroll and Sakho. We could absolutely use a player of his caliber.

Edit: I should add that he would sell more kits than anyone next year, by a wide margin. He is Mexico's favorite son.

Why? Cause they share some historical allegiences. It's like how people in Boston all pretend to speak in a Cork Accent (And sound like the Leprechaun from the Lucky Charms Cereal) around St. Patrick's day. 

1. Japan is fucked up. No seriously. I repeat. Japan took nearly 50 years to apologise for the rape of hundreds of thousands of Asian women. Some of whom are still alive today. To this very day Japanese politicians still pay their respects to war criminals who engineered more death than Hitler. How would you respond if Angela Merkel made offerings to Hitler's Grave? Yeah. That's how Asia bloody feels. Don't bring it up as some sort of pillar of sane behaviour when the allied response after WW II to the Japanese was ""LOL you only killed Asians, that's k!"" 

2. Have you met brits in other countries? Here is a hint. I work in India. There are brits here. Most cannot speak the local language. Those that do speak a few words. They hang out together. They have a few local friends. They don't root for local Cricket teams or whatever. I know... They would rather watch the Premier League rather than the Cricket. 

3. If that's the case will you be deporting the Chinese and Indians who don't have a cultural affinity either but who are profitable to keep around? Or the Hassidic Jews? 

No. Your entire argument is born out of not ever having spoken to any Muslims. You categorise all of them as ""Extremists"". 

Even in World War II, the Brits often treated German prisoners (and Vice Versa) quite well. 

And so I must ask. What is British Culture. The food? Half the food we eat is a product of other country's Cuisines. I mean? You do know that 25% of all food worldwide is originally from North America. No pepper, no peppers, no chilies, no curry, no whiskey, no spices... Music? No Violins and No Rap and No Country! 

Seriously? Multi-culturalism means you get to adopt ideas and mix them with your own. Like curry sauce on your chips. Or the mexican/Indian combination of a Tandoori Chicken wrap. Or Music, Or Art. 

Now you can be as grumpy as you like but the funny thing is? You aren't defending any British Arts or Crafts. Every damn fool who comes  up and speaks about a culture of Britain, can't name anything from it. 

And your response is war? Sigh. Only idiots think that. 

Put it this way. When the BNP fought Asians in Oldham. The people who treated the BNP injured were Asians. That's how little you know about British Culture.

Most of the time, of course, Muslims are not going to behave in this way, but so the same is true of any religion. How many Catholics refuse the use of contraception? Probably few. But the Roman Catholic Church does indeed ban contraception, and will cite chapter and verse in doing so. 

Similarly: How many Muslims want to wage jihad? Probably few. But the clerics of Islam do indeed encourage the waging of jihad, and will cite sura and ayah (chapter and verse for Islam) in doing so. 

The attacks of 9/11, the eslavement of schoolgirls by Boko Haram in Nigeria, the mutilation of female genitalia, the attacks on *Charlie Hebdo*: the people that do/have done these things are are acting canonically according to the teachings of Islam, in accordance with its foundational texts, and in accordance with what is currently taught by Islam's highest clerics.

For more evidence, see the relentless march of Islam throughout history, where it has repeatedly conquered and eliminated the native culture and traditions. See the destruction of Zoroastrianism in Persia (now the Islamic Republic of Iran), or the decimation of Christianity in Turkey and North Africa, or Hinduism in what is now called Pakistan. The pattern of the cultural obliterations is well documented, and often proceeds by the multi-stage process of jihad that I outlined above: colonize, outnumber, conquer.

675 Daytona - if you want an all-rounder you'd be better off with the Speed Triple or the 800 Tiger, which share the same engine design.

BMW - nice in some ways. I used to have an R1200S, which was very pretty. The speedos are wildly optimistic (checked against GPS).

They want to reduce our living standards (zero economic growth) in the name of saving the environment, when there are quite clearly much better alternatives (increasing our nuclear power output, which they're vehemently opposed to for some reason) to doing so. Their economic policies would be devastating, and it's widely accepted that they would destroy London's financial sector. We'd see a stream of business leaving the UK if they ever got into power. 

They want huge tax increases on the wealthy, which really removes an incentive for many businesses to open up here. The 60% tax on earnings over £150k is pretty ridiculous. Once I had earned £150k from my business I would just close it for the rest of the year. Why should I keep it open if I'm only getting 40p for every £1? It'd certainly make many entrepreneurs move overseas. Then their only choice would be to make huge cuts or increase taxes on the less wealthy. 

They plan to borrow over £300 billion more and claim they will then be able to run a surplus, which they really lack any evidence for. 

Not to mention their leader is extremely incompetent. 

They seem to base everything on ideology rather than reality. I could go on but that gives a basic idea of why they're shite.

Diamond read Isaiah chapter 40 verses 28-31:

&gt;Do you not know?
    Have you not heard?
The Lord is the everlasting God,
    the Creator of the ends of the earth.
He will not grow tired or weary,
    and his understanding no one can fathom.
 He gives strength to the weary
    and increases the power of the weak.
 Even youths grow tired and weary,
    and young men stumble and fall;
but those who hope in the Lord
    will renew their strength.
They will soar on wings like eagles;
    they will run and not grow weary,
    they will walk and not be faint.

This program presented Russia in a very unbalanced fashion - thus Yates gives the impression to many watchers that the whole of Russia is a seething melting pot of neo nazis, violent homophobes and ultra far right groups. It is not. There are also plenty of pro democracy groups, LGBT rights campaigns and what you would call ""normal"" people, which Yates didn't give any regard to. 

Secondly, extreme groups like this are not just confined to Russia. There are plenty of extreme groups in the UK and USA.

I live in Reading but I have also lived in Moscow. The people Yates showed are regarded by most of the Russians I know as the skinhead gangs in the bad part of town, and they are given not much more regard than that.

So to answer ""Is this something that is massively rife in Russia"", from my experience living there - no. 

A lot of people are patriotic, but then again a lot in the USA are too, and the Russian patriotism generally doesn’t do beyond the level in the USA. And you have a right to be patriotic.

Unfortunately we managed to get onto the leaderboard that time and felt compelled to stick with the name, even though at every subsequent quiz we've had full numbers. Not hilarious I know, but I guess you could go in a similar vein for a more comical team name (The Three Musketeers if there are only two of you etc.). 

Puns on film names are quite popular as well. When there were 3 of us we went with ""The Good, The Bad and Joe"". It's probably a good thing to avoid puns involving the word ""quiz"", they've been done to death.

To be fair to Pochettino, though, sticking with his system doesn't *necessarily* indicate fundamental inflexibility.  It could also be that he sees his team growing in their understanding of and ability to play his system, but not quite there, so he's sticking with it so they can fully master it and be ready to kick ass next season.  This would make sense if Levy has told him, ""Look, just keep us in the top 7, I'm less worried about scraping into the Champions League this season ... what I want from you is to have us storming into the Champions League the season after.  Y'know, like Liverpool 2013/14.""  

Or it could be stubbornness.  Who knows.

My main point was that quality isn't really the issue, so we don't need CL to improve the team -- we need more coordinated and perceptive scouting.  Your point about Poch ignoring most of the summer 2014 transfers further underscores the need for better scouting.  

One quibble I do have is that I'm not sure we can say that Pochettino brought in these players, though.  Do we have confirmation that these were players he wanted?  Maybe we do, I just haven't seen it.  I'm skeptical because Levy hasn't exactly shown a tendency to back the manager right out of the gate.  

Also, I do think that Pochettino genuinely likes Dier's skillset, and he may have discovered to his surprise that Dier was actually further along in his development than anyone expected.  Not undroppable, but I think Dier is exactly the type of CB he wants, and now it's a matter of helping him continue to develop his rather considerable talent.  Also, related to the scouting issue, somebody really did their job right in finding Dier.

The whole ethos of the secular nation state is grounded in our cultural assumptions, secularism, democracy and the rule of law to name a few. This is completely alien to Islam which is a total system in which secularism and democracy are anathema. You are dealing with ideas which cannot be reconciled and which are bound to lead to conflict.

You see things as so black and white, when the conflicts we are involved in are so grey. You also conflate national identity with religious identity, and fail to realise how natural it is for a huge proportion of our species to have loyalties split down the middle. 

We are currently as a nation fighting a cultural war against a religion, as you seem to be staging it. Our values as British people are jeopardized by the cultural values of the Islamic faith, a faith with almost as many splits in it's doctrine as Christianity. How does one fight a war against an idea in the first place? who knows. Regardless, you have now changed the conversation from why a Muslim might not join the armed forces to another rant against Islam as a culture. Ideas can be reconciled, but use of vulgar force and alienation tend not to achieve much except strengthen an idea. That's how we are in this mess now, because our reactions provide fuel for the Wahhabist movement to recruit new blood, which therefore fuels our responses etc etc ad infinitum. 

For example, lets assume we decide Britain isn't multicultural anymore, specifically not open to Muslims. What do we do with the Muslims here now we have effectively declared them pariahs? Do we allow them to sit, alienated, in amongst our homeland? Just waiting for the opportunity to strike from within?

No, of course not. We send them out, and where do they go? Well, in to the rank-and-file arms of our enemies.

So what do you suggest is done, considering that your ilk's rhetoric has no endgame and just fuels the fire?

It may have escaped your attention that UKIP are frequently labelled as a party of racists and bigots. You may agree with that or you may not, but that this the common consensus. Given this context, it does raise questions when the photos chosen for the manifesto (a document into which a lot of time will have been invested in order to tailor the message they want to send) feature predominantly white people (disproportionately so). 

The sensible thing to do would be to answer the question. If the legitimate reason was ""we booked a modelling agency and these were the people who showed up"", for example the issue is averted. By booing the question and not engaging with it, UKIP have shown that they don't care that their party is viewed as the party of choice for racists. They perceive themselves as fighting the system, breaking the rules by pretending that you can be both decent and a bigot, provided you don't say certain things explicitly. Dodging around the issue like this plays into UKIP's hands, because it resonates with the kind of person that doesn't see something wrong when a party doesn't try its level best to dissociate itself from bigotry.",null,0,null,1429137804,null,0,false,0,cqdog8m,null,t3_32o9i7,null,t1_cqdog8m,null,t1_cqd2koy,null,null,null,1432413640,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Sacking Rodgers after this season would create a whole set of new problems that I don't think anyone in upper management at Liverpool is quite willing to go through, unless absolutely necessary at this point in time.

Keep in mind that the club is not only going to have to be dealing with transfers over the summer, there's the Anfield expansion to deal with along with the pitch upgrades. The club is also replacing Ayre with Billy Hogan. Bringing in a new manager and fulfilling his demands for the squad on top of everything else already going on this summer? I don't think that would be wise at all.

Rodgers has done well during his time at the club, surely better than most of us dared to expect. This season has left a lot to be desired but this is still Rodgers' project and he deserves a chance to continue developing it. The team for next season does not need major additions and hopefully most of the business the club plans to do will have been done early. After that let Brendan focus on working with the team (no big tournament this summer) and let him use all the experience and knowledge he gathered in the past three seasons at our club to really show us what he can do.

Your applying for loads of stuff too so it's clear to me that you don't have a focused direction and are unsure of what you actually want to do. If you can figure that out this will be so much easier. 

Do you want that job, really? The interview is a 2 way process, you are interviewing your potential employer just as much as he is interviewing you. You are trying to decide whether this is a place where YOU can grow and strengthen your skills. Empower yourself by realising this, if the person interviewing seems like a dick I would avoid working there. Find out about their training because your a ""blaaa blaaa focused individual who is ever so concerned with personal development"". Mention something about Star Wars, a genre of games (WOW is usually the big hitter) or LoL. Honestly, showing you have social skills and can fit in to the team. Showing that you can deal with tough situation like ""omg you don't play wow that's embarassing, i just admitted to being a complete nerd in a job interview*akward face followed by a GENUINE laugh"".

So make sure the job is right for you. It's your future so don't torture yourself by taking a bad job. The team your working on matters a lot so this only goes so far.

Even if you aren't cool, your going to have to be cool. Put on your super cool suit or something. I think someone said something like FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT. Remember different jobs have different cools, IT/tech is usually all about talking about the latest google blaa, making jokes about internet explorer, the usual banter. Finance... depends, they are usually void of life and don't take to jokes unless they are really bad. 

It's all a matter of opinion my friend. Each interviewer is different and ultimately the decision lies with them. Don't be too hard on yourself. Every time you get turned down they are basically saying WE DON'T LIKE YOU. You have a first class physics degree &lt;--- this likely isn't the problem. I had the same problem a while back, I admit it fully. I wasn't that great with people and am still improving as much as I can. 

So how do you improve this kind of stuff?
Go out and talk to people. Keep your mind busy and full of colour. Do exercise and keep both your mind and body strong and healthy.

I have said a lot of stuff and hopefully something in here helps you. I could spend hours refining this and adding to it. Hope it helps. The reason I believe it's your people skills is due to you getting in the door. Once your in the door, they have decided to consider you based on what was in your CV. Impressive people are impressive. In your next interview think of this post and take the job because YOU ARE A:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGJuMBdaqIw !!!!! SHOW THEM WHAT YOUR WORTH!

Edit: But only after you have decided that job meets your standards.

I don't agree with this argument (which I've seen a few people use), because I think Ade and Bobby have been so bad this season that Kane would've gone a run at some point anyway.  Process of elimination... we don't exactly have stacks of options to burn through up front at the moment.

Poch is clearly the sort of manager to reward hard work and talent over reputation, so I don't imagine our starting XI would be any different now whether we had Europa or not this season.


&gt; Plus, if we can't handle playing Europa, how would we handle the Champions League?

Much better I would argue.  Champions League is by far the more exciting competition, and I reckon players get far more motivated because of it.  If you're a player, what's gonna be more exciting... playing on some cabbage patch in Romania against a team you've literally never heard of, or lining up at the San Siro, or Nou Camp, or Bernabeu?  We play shit in Europa because it's a shit competition.

We clearly don't have the squad to play UCL football at the moment, so things obviously need to improve to even consider that.  But the windfall and the prospect of playing in the UCL is far greater than it is in Europa.

What has been verified and backed up by a number of people connected to the show is the allegation Keith Boak was bullying extras and runners, that Eccleston tried to step in, and that he was unhappy because he felt Phil Collinson swept the Boak issue under the rug and didn't deal with it properly. Boak was never invited back, of course, and there's a resounding silence about him.

null,false,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,null,"&gt; To be fair to Pochettino, though, sticking with his system doesn't necessarily indicate fundamental inflexibility. It could also be that he sees his team growing in their understanding of and ability to play his system, but not quite there, so he's sticking with it so they can fully master it and be ready to kick ass next season.

It's possible, but it puzzles me that after playing strictly this way for nearly an entire season, we aren't really playing with any greater fluidity or cogency than we did at the start of the campaign.  We haven't progressed as a team... I could count perhaps 4 games this entire season where we honestly looked good from start to finish.  That's not good enough.

Being ""new"" is no longer an excuse when you've only got half a dozen games to go in the season.  And besides... look what Koeman has achieved this season, or Martinez last season.  You don't need a full season of playing like shit before things turn around.  Poch might have the Rodgers effect and have a barnstorming second season, but the way things are going, I think it's far more likely for him to continue in more or less a similar vein, and have a second season more akin to AVB's.

Your points about the scouting and player acquisition are completely bang on (we know for certain that Fazio wasn't Poch's first choice - Mussachio was), but I do honestly think UCL would help there.  We for instance have no chance of landing a player as good as Depay or Lacazette in the summer... but with UCL on offer, we possibly could manage it.

At the moment I feel like we're doomed to bringing in decent-but-not-great players from foreign leagues, taking punts on youngsters, and hoping homegrown players kick on.  That's not a recipe for success on a consistent basis.  You might luck out and arrive at a perfect storm where VDV, Modric and Bale all land in your side at the same time, but you're also just as likely to end up where we currently have... with a mediocre side that has 2-3 genuinely great players poorly support by a bunch of misfits.",null,0,null,1429143376,null,0,false,0,cqdrnr9,null,t3_32k44w,null,t1_cqdrnr9,null,t1_cqdnsem,null,null,null,1432415223,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

Nicola Sturgeon - SNP - Great points, well argued. Made me wish they where actually a national party rather than a regional party as I can't vote for them. Challenged both Labour and Conservatives. Good job over all, won the debate and (in spirit) my vote.

Nigel Farage - UKIP - Great charisma, actually answered questions, made some good points that people didn't argue but instead just mocked... no wonder this man gets support when you make him look like the only honest guy while everyone else arrogantly spews rhetoric. Sadly he represents a truly backwards party and is pretty much always wrong, but he came scarily close to winning this debate.

Nick Clegg - Lib Dem - Did shockingly well actually. Was humble, was seemingly quite honest. Had some answers and ideas but while he had good points, ""let's be the middle ground"" is a poor position to argue from.

Ed Miliband - Labour - Some good points on minimum wage and bedroom tax. Did a good job overall, but floundered a little and was attacked a lot with no comebacks. Did at least get my attention a little.

David Cameron - Conservative - Great charisma and good clear statements for much of the time speaking, but damn people where relentlessly attacking him, especially Ed Miliband so he naturally didn't come out of this debate well, and attempting to lump UKIP and Labour together came across as desperate.

Leanne Wood - Plaid Cymru - Good points and the only time we've had genuine socialism discussion in these debates for a while, also props for calling out Nigel Farage when no-one else had the balls to. Unfortunately for much of the debate she sounded like a spoilt child complaining because big sister Scotland gets more pocket money. Inconsequential really.

Natalie Bennett - Greens - Sad, really sad... she answered the questions but was largely forgettable and had no real on screen presence. She also seemed to shy away from discussing issues that matter that people care about, like Trident and fracking that she could have distinguished herself on, or reinforce her position on tuition fees, bedroom tax, the NHS enough. She also mentioned environmental issues far to often, as the Greens are trying to avoid the stigma of being a one-issue party. Disappointing.

As a Green supporter I was disappointed by the debate. The winners where SNP and UKIP sadly, they had the better charisma, and gave the better debates. Sadly, Green, who I was hoping would be able to distinguish itself a little came off as an extra. Plaid Cymru, an insignificant regional party that will never make any significant difference to Westminster left more of an impression and that's just sad.

null,false,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,null,"&gt; Wait a sec, CL gives you money after you've played. Not like they give you a pile of cash the second you qualify.

And Europa is different?  I don't understand your point.

UCL of course only gives you money for playing, but you're guaranteed six games up front, with no doubt very handsome gate receipts for the three home games.  The club then projects that money into their cash-flow and can plan accordingly for the season, going into debt in transfers knowing that the money will flow in before the turn of the year.  If we qualify for the knockouts, things only get better.


&gt; And you can only attract big name talent - which hasn't really been our policy - if you can continue to qualify for CL. One season in the CL doesn't magically transform the club (sure as hell didn't last time we qualified).

I'm not talking about attracting ""big name talent"" like Ibrahimovich or Falcao... it's more like the ability to attract someone like a Depay or a Lacazette - good players who are killing it in their domestic league, and ready to make the jump to a top league but no doubt are far more likely to sign for a UCL side than a non-UCL one.  The competitive advantage we have as a club at the moment is that we can offer young, talented players starting time.  Lacazette might end up signing for Chelsea, but there's no fucking way he's going to immediately be getting game time over Hazard or Costa.  But I also think he'd far prefer sitting on the bench at Chelsea than starting for us in godforsaken Eastern European countries playing shitty Thursday night Europa matches.

So one season of UCL doesn't make us a magically great club, but the idea is that if we get it once, and use that window to attract some good players, then hopefully that will build the nucleus of a side that will kick on and continue to perform well.  It's the Arsenal model essentially... become an incumbent to UCL football and then use that leverage in the transfer market to keep yourself there.  There's a reason why they can sign players like Ozil and Sanchez and we can't, and I'd say it's entirely because of their ability to keep themselves in the Champions League, even if they never get past the first knock-out round!",null,0,null,1429143930,null,0,false,0,cqdrzwb,null,t3_32jmd1,null,t1_cqdrzwb,null,t1_cqd8rdd,null,null,null,1432415381,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

I would love to see him manage Liverpool one day.  
It's just not the time, Rodgers has shown naivety in the past and a reluctance to stray from his ideals/system. However, I feel that now he is willing to try new things. He knows what the players are capable of and has implemented some clever systems that have had amazing success the diamond last season, the 3 at the back this year and I’m hoping to see more of the ""false nine"" he played Monday. These options give him a Plan B or a Plan C when his original plan fails, which I know was what worried me the most.  
This season was always going to be a struggle, after selling Suarez, who I cannot state how much we relied on last year, if you had told me we would go 13 Premier League games unbeaten I would've taken that in a heartbeat.  
Young players will always take time to come good and there will always be some misses in there. But I can deal with them misses if the hits are going to play like Coutinho or Can.   
I would compare getting rid of Rodgers now to stopping building a house when the foundations have been laid. Football is too fickle nowadays lose two games and your job is instantly scrutinised regardless of the bigger picture.

To be fair, we were probably never going to be Arsenal at the Emirates.  Utd were just hitting form when we played them and really anything can happen in a Utd-Liv game.  I'm not at all surprised we lost both of those games, but I was cautiously hoping for 4 points.

&gt;and if he's going to insist on playing without strikers, he's going to need to work out how to get goals out of his midfield.

Part of the problem is that he didn't have any other options.  I REALLY still want to give Balotelli the benefit of the doubt here, but he has been largely ineffective.  Sturridge has constantly battled injuries this year, which really set us back.  Borini/Lambo just do not have enough quality to lead the line.

There have been a number of changes at the club over the course of the season as part of the owners on-going evaluation of the club, including Hogan and the opening of the London office, changes to the Youth organization, etc- none of these really have anything to do with the manager per se.

All you need to do is earn on average £4,000 more than the threshold each year. The current threshold is £21,000 so anyone with a career average of over 25k is worse off.

In addition, while the other parts of the repayment are guaranteed to be adjusted against inflation so sort of balance out, the 21k level is not only not adjusted but is currently moving down rather than up.

No what this is is pro-tory/Labour crap, I have no doubt that the Lib Dems and Green parties stance is the exact opposite, don't try and delude yourself into something that isn't true just because you are unwilling to assess or change your stance.

All authoritarian parties are going to have this stance, i.e. Labour, Conservative, UKIP, BNP (do they still exist), however parties like the Lib Dems, SNP and other third parties have a more level stance, with the The Greens being very libertarian, the exact opposite of your premise. 

What I don't understand about the conservative vote is do their votes actually believe what they are doing is good for Britain as a whole, as in all 70 million people, or do they just believe what they are doing is best for them, the middle class, and just don't give a crap about the country as a whole? Because the former just isn't true, however you cut it, cutting services to the extent they are is just deteriorating them, which if you are middle class and have private healthcare with your job, don't need unemployment benefit due to erratic work, don't have to take the bus, isn't a problem. But if you do, you don't have another option like the middle class, how does taking away the lower and even lower middle classes only option make Britain better? Do they really believe that the £800 (or whatever it is) a year better off they are, which will most likely just go on a better holiday, car or TV etc. anyway, is actually helping Britain more than running government services? And if they do really need that £800 a year for essential goods, should they not be supporting a party that is looking to fund government services that they can use? 

The conservatives seem to just have a cut everything irrelevant of merit approach, if it exists cut it. I agree that labour had created a large number of useless government QUANGO's, and some of the government need to be cut, but was the NHS really over funded? Was the Police really over funded? Or are they just cutting this stuff because your average conservative voter won't notice because they live in a low crime area and are healthy at work?

The Conservatives seem to favour moving towards a more American ideal and away from a European one, the problem is America is ridiculously broken, you have people working until they die to have healthcare and school systems that would sicken me if they existed in the UK. Then you have places like Sweden, Denmark and Germany with balanced economies, equal rights, workers rights, successful first world countries with great standard of living for the vast majority, on the other end if you take it too far you end up like France with unions running the show and strikes every other week, the other end of broken.

To get a squad that can compete on four fronts, when you eventually qualify CL, you need depth unless the goal is to accomplish a Liverpool (which is actually what happened last time we played in the CL. Our first time was better than our current team, but depth was not there so we failed to qualify for the subsequent round).

So that leaves us with two recruiting options if we want to have some significance in the CL if we qualify and want to qualify for the next competition. Either recruit slowly and assess the players over a season when they settle so that we're ready when we do qualify or recruit in numbers like we did last season. Unless there is a third course of action we can take I'm not aware of? We need four competitions to assess players and not let them stagnate.

&gt;Depay or a Lacazette

First time hearing of Lacazette, so you got me there. But promising players like Depay are big names, at least after the WC. Considering Poch's recruiting strategy so far (or what we did this transfer window) seems to be aimed at young cheap players. I doubt we'll do another aging player like Soldado or Ade unless they come as a free agent (or GK). I doubt we'll land Depay as a lot of clubs are after him. Use Depay as a baseline for what I mean by big names.

I am confused you were adamant about voting Tory but are against this? The tories whole mandate is to make the rich richer, i.e. you keep your own money and don't share it around, and then pandering to the middle class to get more votes, with things about families and childcare, while those families ignore the fact that they just lumped all their children with £40K debt if they want a university education, because in the end, the parents don't have to pay that and they are the ones who are voting, ironically in their own interest, but not their children's. 

The conservative voting pool is from the middle class, lower middle class and rich people, hence they cut everything, the rich doesn't use any of these services, police, they live in low crime areas, the NHS, they have private healthcare, schools, they pay for private schooling. The middle class are similar on a large majority of these things. Even the school one, they can afford to live in the better school districts, even if they can't afford private education.

Then you have the lower middle class, the people who like to believe they are rich, but aren't, of course they vote for the tories, that is what other rich people do, then they even get an extra bit of cash from the cuts they make, all great right? Wrong, the lower middle class are actually using the services that are being cut from, they use the NHS, they use the school system, crime is higher in the neighbourhoods so they use the police. They lose out from the rich and middle class not paying in to services that would help them all so they can get a short-term monetary gain. Lets say they gain £500, yet if they didn't have this £500 and it went towards the government services, a middle class person who wasn't using their ""fair share"" of the services would have put in £750, a rich person who is using essentially none of the them £1500, the services they use are now out of pocket by £2750 all so they could get £500.

On to the second part- as an older sort myself (close to BR's age), my experience both in real life and online has been that very generically speaking the older supporters are more apt to support a managerial change than the younger crowd.  Part of it has to do I think with many of the older crowd viewing Brendan as a bit of a snake oil salesman from the beginning which isn't something I've seen put across often on here and I suspect another part is the older crowd have been through so many manager changes it's sort of expected at this point.  Myself, I've been through ten or something like that from Fagan to now, so I just don't see it as that big of a deal really whereas I read a comment from a newer/younger supporter on here the other day where there exposure had been from Hodgson (awful) to now by which BR probably does seem a god send in comparison.

For those wondering how this can be possible, there is a complex system of guarantees on the student loans debt but you can think of it like this, in the old system we were like parents (the country) buying our children (students) a house (uni education) and then letting them repay us. Sure they might miss some payments and we end up a bit out of pocket but in the new model we let our children buy the house and act as guarantor on a mortgage from a bank but we only step in to help with the money after the loan has gone bad and they have racked up numerous missed repayments and interest on their debt. Obviously which of the two scenarios is more expensive depends on the specific numbers but it turns out that it's almost certainly the 2nd approach for us. And that's before we even consider the fact that our kids are paying more under the second scheme in total as well. 

Let's also not forget that the new system removed many of the protections on loan repayment (there's no defined threshold or formula to cover the new loans unlike old loans). 21k today is a decent chunk of money to be earning now but in 10 years time it wont be so all this threshold has to do is stay still. 

Let's also, also not forget that you can save a bomb on the loans by repaying them off all in one go hence they really favour people with 27k to hand - something that lib dems promised to penalise (not realistic but they said they would do it in the initial debates on the issue) but never got round to.",null,0,null,1429147806,null,0,false,0,cqdugb6,null,t3_32or31,null,t1_cqdugb6,null,t1_cqd956m,null,null,null,1432416539,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Listen you twining wosser, I was the proverbial guinea pig generation. The first to do GCSE's, the first to have grants cut and the first to have 'optional' student loans. Can you image how pissed off I was?

But that was not the fuck up. The fuck up was Tony Bliar and his stupid ["" 50% target for university participation amongst young adults""](http://www.chatpolitics.org/tony-blair-blame-tuition-fees/). What utter fucking nonsense. But because of such idiocy number rose and the costs rose with them, till you end up with this asinine situation where kids can't get a job without a degree and can't get a job with one because there are too many fucking graduates. Not even bright graduates either. They knobs I've had to interview makes me cringe half the time.

Point is only someone delusional as Tony Bliar could ever think that would work but unless you restrict the number going to university you can never get away from needing loans.  

Clegg was a knob to have been sucked into that fairy tale and should have looked at the books before he opened his mouth. Trouble is Labour kept the books and well we all remember the note left for the new boys when they got to the office. ['Sorry Ain't no money left']( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/17/liam-byrne-note-successor) what the fuck did you think the Lib Dems could do?

Well what they did do was pretty much all the rest of the stuff in their manifesto. 

 * Raised the personal income tax allowance, 
* increase child care benefits, 
* stopped the Tories ramming through the snoopers charter 

and  

* pushed the banks to balance the books:

We're almost at the close of his third season at Liverpool and in two of those three seasons we've either been in the relegation zone at Christmas, or closer to it than to the top 4. 

Barring this season, in which BVB have had terrible injury problems and their signings haven't bedded in, Klopp has been a model of consistency and has repeatedly done less with more. He's twice won the Bundesliga, which is very competitive, over Bayern Munich who are far better than any team currently in the Premier League. 

Even this season, when Dortmund were in the dumps, they still mounted a strong European challenge. Players want to play for Klopp and I think he's the man to take Liverpool forward by actually executing FSG's plan. 

I understand what you mean about it coming a season too soon, but I feel BR has had his chance. Klopp will not be available in January or next summer, so it has to be now.
