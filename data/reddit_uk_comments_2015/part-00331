But the Eastern front is what won the war, the Eastern front is what stopped Hitler invading England. The Battle of Britain kept back the first attempt, but the fact that Russia was moving ungodly numbers of troops into the fray was the reason there wasn't a second. 

The reason the allies made such rapid progress through Europe was because even when they knew they were losing, German Generals were intentionally sending more forces and resources from the west to the East to slow the Russians so that US/UK and chums would take Germany, because they feared Germany in the hands of the communists far more than surrender to the democratic states.

And you also need to look at how the games went.  In the first 2 games, we were not chasing the game.  We were looking to hold a lead.  It makes no sense to put in a second striker at that time.  In fact, if you look back at the first game, Ings was about to come in to press for the win (when it was 0-0), but that changed when Coutinho scored (as the focus shifted from chasing the game to holding the lead).  That would have been a second striker system.

If we look at the arsenal game, although we were piling on pressure in the first half (later parts, it didn't start that way) we did not have piles of possesion.  Firmino and Ibe both offer a high work rate in pressing.  Yes, Ibe didn't have a great game....   but obviously more was expected of him.  I admit I am not as familiar with Origi, but he doesn't strike me as the same type of player (as far as defensive work).  Based on the amount of pressure we were under, it looks very much like we were trying to absorb pressure and hit them on the break (which Ibe is great at, and also implies why Moreno was subbed in late).

Also, dude its been 3 games.  All league games in a season when we very, very much needed a strong start.

null,null,listyraesder,null,null,null,"Okay. So ITV4 carried the *Tour de France*. Halfords don't care whether 2 million or 200,000 people are watching, because of the extremely high interest of whatever viewership ITV4 is going to reach. Now if they ran an advert to 2m people on Channel 4, their conversion to sales is going to be pretty low. They might see 20,000 transactions made on the back of that ad. But going out to 200,000 tour viewers, their conversion will be quite high. They might see 40,000 conversions from impact to transaction. 

And that's what advertising is about. It isn't about the number of people who *see* the advert, it's about the number of people who *act* on it.

Advertising is sold not on the basis of audience numbers, but on *Impacts*. One impact equals one pair of eyeballs on the advert. This deviates from viewership in important ways. For example, the difference is more pronounced for BGT or Corrie, where a family of four will be more likely to gather together. Nominally, they would be 1 audience member in the ratings. But they are 4 impacts. So family shows are more valuable than raw ratings.

Channels and shows are aimed at a demographic, so that the impacts + demo that wants your service or product = sales. Sky Sports is a good place to sell razors and BMWs, a bad place for tampons. Sky Living is a great place for tampons, but probably not great for a golfing resort. This targeting compensates for the relatively small audiences of such channels because a narrower focus is more conducive to converting impacts. Except for one channel. ITV.

ITV is the only commercial mainstream channel with a high audience. A full demo spread young to old, across incomes and lifestyles, with a range of programming. It is also the only place to run regional advertising. So if you want to sell Daz or other FMCG's, your first and often only stop is ITV ad sales. It doesn't matter how other people do in the ratings, ITV is the only place where you can blast a whole cross-section of the country at once.

Broadcasters give ad buyers a target range of impacts, so ads are sold in very general terms. 2.3m viewers is indistinct from 2.5m. Ads are also sold months or weeks ahead of time, so ratings affects future business rather than current values. But, by then, ITV will be showing a different series in the timeslot anyway, so it's all about the annual or monthly averages.",null,0,null,1440613083,null,null,false,0,cugiyvo,null,t3_3ibaww,null,null,null,t1_cugetx6,null,null,null,1441512481,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt; So these Medical Staff? What are we paying them for? Why didn't they do scans on him? Make sure he's alright? You're just going to let him walk out and not check on a player you signed for ¬£16m?

First of all, the first step is a physical examination where the physio would test range of motion and level of discomfort while looking for swelling in order to make a diagnosis.  They don't just take him directly in to have an MRI.  So the conclusion could have been that there was just minor discomfort given if it was truly faked there would be very little swelling and they'd have to take his word for any pain he felt since there's no objective way to ensure he's actually in pain.

Players do not like uncertainty and why perform for a manager who may not be there in 2-or 12 months. If your going to convince players to commt long term you have to be commited yourself.

 I watched the Norwich/Sunderland game a few weeks ago and I thought Sunderland were an absolute joke. Couldn't believe what I was watching, did not look like a Premier League team. Wes Hoolahan ran the game despite his age and lack of speed. The main problem looked to be the defence and the midfield. Kaboul looked shocking, never have a seen someone who is supposed to have a bit of pace look so damn slow. It seemed like Sunderland only scored because Norwich took their foot off the gas in the second half.



 I think there is a huge problem at Sunderland, might be due to the mentality of players like Cattermole/Seb. Cattermole always gets a lot of credit, but it seems like they've pretty much changed every player bar him and Seb (who i think was a really decent player, but he is getting older and it seems to have hindered his game a lot). They've changed the rest of the players pretty much and yet they are still in the same situation every single season. I can't for the life of me understand how managers seem to be invincible at the end of a season, and then when the season starts they are an absolute mess. That can't be the managers fault if they exact same thing is happening with every single manager you hire. 


I don't know what the deal is with the outgoing and incoming players, but your squad seems like it could do with 4/5 players at least. 



If this comes across as mean i hope you know that that wasn't my intention, I've watched 18 full games this season and that performance against Norwich is by far the worst, the only one that would even be close to it was Arsenals performance against West Ham. I'm not saying we will beat yous or we will finish ahead of yous, just basing what I saw in only one game and i don't think it would be fair to make judgments on the other two games based on MOTD highlights ",null,0,null,1440613668,null,null,false,0,cugjd2k,null,t3_3ihsb9,null,null,null,t3_3ihsb9,null,null,null,1441512667,null,8,null,avfc,t5_2s569,8,null

It's partly because of his replies to my comments further down the thread (his story makes zero sense), and partly because I am on disability benefits for mental health issues - they are *not* stopping them. [They have changed it/are changing it so people like us are not considered ""vulnerable"", making it easier to sanction us for minor infractions and to push people into work when they are not fit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3g51qp/sanctioned_jobseekers_with_mental_health_problems/)

There are people in situations like this across the country, really and truly, and I would not lightly condemn someone claiming to be suffering these hardships (it's a real honest-to-God situation that many people are suffering through - hunger, homelessness, financial hardship... you can count me in the first and last of these) - like I said, it just does not add up.

Edit: Also, does anyone remember a post extremely similar to this very recently from a man who had been sanctioned, and lots of people offered him help/money? It was structured just like this. He refused it all, as has the OP of this thread further down, just to clarify.

We should all relax, our youth players will get their chances, but it's difficult to put them in the team when you need your better players getting minutes early in the season too. Bony is our second striker and needs minutes as well. So does Nasri who's competing with Rony. 

The League Cup game against Sunderland might be a better test, if we end up leading comfortably (which is a big if, since Sunderland away is still difficult). There should be no need to play Aguero in that game as he needs rest, so Nacho might get some game time and maybe Rony too. 

Pellegrini clearly trusts the youth if he is going into the season with Nacho as a third choice striker, with our strikers' recent injury troubles. He had an easier time bringing in youth at Malaga and Villarreal because they didn't have the quality of players throughout the squad that we currently have, but he is keen to play them, I feel.

null,null,AdrianBlake,cnty-uk,Yorkshireman living in Dorset,null,"Ok, so this is a video that parodies genuine videos released in order to raise awareness of a big problem in this country, whereby people are being almost knocked down, and then attacked in the street for speaking up. The video copies the style and the language of the videos, but replaces it with an over reactive cyclist who is causing a scene over nothing.

I think the reason this video was made, was to appeal to the large and vocal section of society who don't like cyclists being on the road, and who find it convenient to think cyclists exaggerate the issues they face. It is taking a video to spread awareness of an issue and making a mockery of that very serious violent issue. I don't think that's ok. I think a lot of people, inlcuding OP and the person who made the video, only think it's OK because they feel that cyclists being attacked on the road isn't an issue or is a joke issue. 

Those same people wouldn't ordinarily see the trivialisation of other violent crimes to be ok, the video creator probably wouldn't make a video trivialising other kinds of violence, but because cyclists are ""those annoying twats who jump red lights"" people make subconcious exceptions. 

So you have to present the issue in a different setting where they do care about the victim.

Imagine someone copying the style of a recent viral video depicting a racist attack. But in this case, a man is throwing himself at the floor next to some EDL supporters and shouting the same words as from the video, and starts yelling in their faces whilst the other guys just walk on about their day.

Or copying the style of one of those happy slap videos, but this time it's just some woman running towards some teenagers in hoodies and shouting ""Argh they're attacking me! Help help! They just punched me and filmed it!"" whilst pushing them away.

Or the example I gave originally. 

I think that was all fairly obvious from my original comment, I think you actually knew what I was actually saying, I think you just.... wanted to jump on the ""This guy likes cyclists and said cyclists getting punched is worse than a woman getting punched!!!"" wagon.

You wouldn't accept people making videos that trivialise any other kind of violent assault, but yet call someone out for trivialising the daily assaults of cyclists and you get ""Are you saying this is worse than that?""",null,0,null,1440614369,null,null,1440614645,0,cugjtwp,null,t3_3igmes,null,null,null,t1_cugipw2,null,null,null,1441512887,null,0,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

Because of her situation I feel like she could be suicidal and that scares me enough to not want to own a gun, I wouldn't want to be responsible in anyway. 

Whats sad is that those who are mentally ill can still acquire gun legally because here in America its all about the fear of what a gun can do, that its the gun that kills people. It's never the fact that the person wielding the gun wants to hurt someone. And it has become taboo to admit you need help because you feel like you want to murder. 

This country could really use a kick in the ass and admit that making a weapon only capable of holding five rounds at a time will not stop mass shootings, dumping the money uselessly wasted on making these laws into mental health programs would benefit us all.

What is wrong with the way we go about it, to act like everyone should get a gun is just plainly idiotic. However a bigger problem is the fact that shooting are generally carried out by those who have told people (doctors or for those who couldn't get help family) that they were going to commit these horrendous acts. Too many don't care about mental health or taking care of others, they just want their guns and they will be damned if you try to take away someone else's.",null,0,null,1440615445,null,null,false,0,cugkkdq,null,t3_3ihl6c,null,null,null,t1_cughncd,null,null,null,1441513233,null,-7,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-7,null

Or how they keep their favourite Remington 12 gauge next to the bed in-case of a home invasion.

In comparison I think it is very rare to hear anyone in the UK talk about carrying a weapon to prevent a mugging or home invasion (which I'm not sure are even that common over here).

Never expected anything against United, and to only just lose to a deflected goal shows that we do have a talented squad. Especially considering the large amount of new players will need a bit of time to settle into the prem. 

Could've done better against Palace, but I liked that we were taking more risks in attack, a drastic contrast to last season's ""timid"" football we played under Lambert. So am really happy with the style changes Tim is trying to make. It's obviously still a work in progress, but as the season progresses the players will get used to what Tim is asking of them.

Very happy with the business so far, some top quality signings. I just hope we've done enough to convert the cash spent into goals and wins. I know a lot of fans are still looking for us to sign a right, back and striker who is a proven goalscorer, but if the window ended now I'm sure most fans wouldn't be too disappointed.

Personally I see this season as a transition season for Villa. Ideally we would comfortably avoid relegation, strengthen the squad, and look to break into the top 10 next season.

This weekend I think we will win, but it won't be the pushover Sunderland we've seen so far this season. They had a great cup performance yesterday and I can see them coming to the game with a lot of confidence. I predict a 3-2 Villa win.

I'm sorry to say this year I can only see Sunderland going down. I don't think Defoe has the legs to bang in goals all season, and I can't see Pantilimon's heroics being enough to keep them up again.

The 'ghost' 2nd string would consist of the 7 bench players. 

Can is the energy we need after 60 minutes. Putting pressure on who of the 3 middle isn't performing. Lallana comes in when Coutinho is having an off day. 

Firmino/Sturridge/Benteke would split 2 starting spots depending on fitness and form. For me I think Sturridge should be playing only 60 minutes even when hes completely fit. Keeping him healthy would propel us to a top 4 finish, and imo him playing less minutes does that. 

and this would be more of a 4-3-1-2 not the diamond, if Lucas is in they can play the deeper diamond, but this would play more like a retro Kaka's Milan, 'controlling space', half-block press, counter-attack, Studge/Cou/Firmino looking for drop downs from Benteke when we go long, wingbacks providing width.

As for handguns being easier to conceal than other arms. Do you know how you make a shotgun or rifle as concealable as a pistol? With a hacksaw...

In the UK you cannot own a .22lr semi auto pistol without a Section 5 license. You can quite easily own a semi automatic .22lr rifle. Take a hacksaw to the latter and you essentially have the former and have completely circumvented the law. 

Of course, law abiding, licensed firearm owners would never do this and so you have to ask who does that prohibition really harm? The criminal who doesn't care about using the hacksaw or the law abiding licensed owner? Given the answer to that, how does that prohibition make any difference to safety or wellbeing of the general populace?

null,null,zedest,null,null,null,"&gt;It's to be expected, but the policy consultation launched this morning on the issue of street harassment has been skewed by some of the press reporting - which has focused on one part: that of women-only carriages. The key point is that these are *consultations*, not policy prescriptions. A spokesperson for the campaign has reiterated:

&gt;""This is one of seven policy ideas that have arisen from issues raised by women, asking women for their views on how best to deal with harassment in public spaces. These policies are all driven by the knowledge that we must tackle harassment by changing men's behaviour, not blaming or penalising women - this is why they include proposals for better holding men to account, for ensuring women can report incidents without fear of being dismissed, and for better equipping public officials to prevent harassment. At last we are having a national debate about the problem of harassment in our society - it has been overlooked by the political and media establishment for too long. Our policy in this area will be driven by the views of women.""

&gt;The policy statement reads:

&gt;""Some women have raised with me that a solution to the rise in assault and harassment on public transport could be to introduce women only carriages. My intention would be to make public transport safer for everyone from the train platform, to the bus stop to on the mode of transport itself. However, I would consult with women and open it up to hear their views on whether women-only carriages would be welcome - and also if piloting this at times and modes of transport where harassment is reported most frequently would be of interest.""",null,0,null,1440616805,null,null,false,0,cuglhyx,null,t3_3ie245,null,null,null,t3_3ie245,null,null,null,1441513674,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Corbyn is popular amongst labour members (some old and many very very new) but if he can't broaden his appeal to the masses he's unelectable to where it matters: Government. 

Edit: Also INB4 someone points out David Cameron isn't very popular.

Levy came out after the stadium deal and said that we would not be making anymore moves until late until the window. We all knew that this would be the case.

&gt; Do you think there's a genuine lack of planning on the part of Spurs, (and other clubs) or is it over-played? Are these later transfers just part of football, or are we all mutually panicking?

I really doubt that Levy is panicking. I am certain that Mitchell and Poch have established a list of players that they are interested in and I am confident that Levy is on board with them. I think that only some of the fans are panicking.

3 games later and we have no wins. I have heard some people saying that we should have 9 points, and I just shake my head and remind them who they support.

Mexico (like 'high gun-control' states) is a poor example, since gun control is pointless when you have very little control over your borders; it's the equivalent of designating an area of a lake as being a 'no-water zone' then being surprised to find that it's still wet no matter how hard you bail. Mexico actually seriously suffers from the US's lax gun laws, [with the majority of firearms in the country being legally purchased in the US, then illegally smuggled across the border.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smuggling_of_firearms_into_Mexico#Sources_of_weapons)* While traffic from Mexico to the US is heavily monitored, the flow vice versa is a lot more porous, since Mexico is currently dealing with huge cartel wars and universal corruption, which are stretching its resources a little thin.

null,null,SpaceboyMcGhee,,Misguided Glory Hunter,null,"1. After 3 games I'm pretty fine with things so far.  We've effectively got a whole new side settling in and so far things have been relatively solid if unspectacular.  Our games have consisted of Man U at home (which is effectively a right-off for us historically) and then two winnable away games against Bournemouth and Palace.. we've won one of those.  If we can continue winning 50% of our away games this season I won't be complaining. 

2. I'm generally happy with Sherwood, primarily because after the continual attempts by Lambert to play risk-free football it's nice to see the team actually trying to attack.  Oh and he did keep us up and get us to an FA Cup final too which was nice.  That said he has already shown the potential to make some really odd decisions on occasion... so it's not uniformly positive. 

3. I'm happy bordering delighted with our transfer business.  Whether or not the players bought actually work out (and I think a fair few of them at least will, Amavi in particular looks incredible) what I'm most excited by is that we seem to be adopting a coherent sensible transfer strategy overall.  We've bought up a bunch of young players with a lot of potential (as far as anyone can tell anyway) from outside the premier league and are relying primarily on academy graduates to maintain a homegrown core.  I think this is a totally sound way of growing the quality of the squad long term while still keeping it representative of the fans  and hopefully the club will stick with it.  On a more day to day level, the reason I'm not head-over-heels delighted is that I think we might still lack for goals a bit as we're currently looking reliant on Gestede and Ayew (or, shudders, Gabby) and there's no guarantee either of them will pay off. 

4. Given the massive squad churn I'd be happy with anything other than a last day relegation struggle.  As long as we stay in the league I think our team will be significantly improved by having a year to grow together so hopefully we can aim for top half next year. 

5. I would give us the edge primarily because we're at home.  I think we'll win by the odd goal in a nervy close match which I imagine I'm going to find gut wrenching to watch.  I also wonder if going into the international break this fixture could have a big effect on our season, if we win then the squad can get another week or so of training together in high spirits and we hopefully move on confidently from there to see out the season quite comfortably.  If we lose though.. a lot of people, not least on this subreddit will be panicking already and I'm not sure how well the squad will be able to gel under that pressure. 

6. As a club I actually see Sunderland as very similar to Villa, we've both got revenues, wage bills and supports that should put us comfortably in the top half all else being equal.. and yet we've both had a shocking recent history.  I HOPE that we're in the process of turning the corner but I have to say I'm less optimistic for Sunderland.  I feel like keeping Advocaat on was a real mistake; he did decently to keep you up but nothing more than that and signing him up for another year just seems like a negative, this-will-do appointment especially given that he didn't even seem totally convinced himself.  The worst thing from a Sunderland perspective though is that I look around the league and I can't really see any definitively bad teams.. from the evidence of what we've seen to date it's hard to think of three that would finish below you.  Hope I'm wrong though!

It once was a world-leading institute, loved throughout the world for it's fantastic content and news coverage but I don't feel that's what the BBC is like anymore and a lot of the current love for the BBC is through rose-tinted spectacles of what it was like in the past.

Unfortunately to many it's sacrilege to speak ill of the BBC so I doubt we're going to see any meaningful reform and it will continue to straddle the line of impartiality and strike out against any threat to the establishment when it is given the opportunity.

It's certainly not the worst but it's completely unacceptable for a broadcaster that we are legally obligated to pay for if we wish to watch any TV.

By reducing the amount of legal gun-owners?

&gt;  The majority of gun crime may be committed by individuals who acquired the guns illegally before the crime, but the vast majority of those guns were manufactured legally within the US, and then later stolen or sold to illegal dealers.

So then make it illegal to lose a gun, why would you simply choose to ban the gun?

What does any of your second paragraph have to do with my point? Gun control does not prevent the illegal ownership of guns, and they're entirely unrelated. We can talk about Jamaica (which is surrounded by a body of water, like us) if you want too.

You're conflating two different sets of issues (although it actually makes no odds *vis a vis* gun control. Syria is/was your common or garden civil war. A right to bear arms is significant only as long as it takes for supply chains to be set up, and then you're knee deep in AK-47s and as many .50 cal toting technicals as you can run.

Assuming you're talking about Iraq when referring to the rest of the middle east, that's a state against (effectively) another state actor. Your codified right to bear arms is significant for literally no time at all, as you're either a refugee or you're standing and fighting with weapons supplied by government.",null,0,null,1440619289,null,null,false,0,cugn82v,null,t3_3ihl6c,null,null,null,t1_cugkkdq,null,null,null,1441514552,null,6,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

I'm not to the level of absolutely hating her and wanting her dead, but a change wouldn't be a bad thing in my opinion. Here is actually a basic storyline of how I would like to see her go out: 

I think it would be brilliant to see Clara and the Doctor grow apart slowly while the Doctor and Missy grow closer. Clara would become angry that he takes her on as a companion (possibly to find Gallifrey?) and she starts acting out as Missy is given more and more freedom. By the end of the series, Clara has an evil plan of her own that the Doctor and Missy must stop, and as events play out Clara slowly realizes that she has turned to evil and sacrifices herself in order to save the Doctor/Missy and whatever innocents were in danger due to her plans. Clara dies redeemed, maybe Missy shows her true evil self in the process and all is right with the universe...for now.",null,0,null,1440619597,null,null,false,0,cugnfs3,null,t3_3ii0oi,null,null,null,t3_3ii0oi,null,null,null,1441514652,null,0,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0,null

I don't see a 75 year old man being able to get away from an 18 year old mugger wielding a knife.  I think that UK law regarding weapons is because the nobility and toffs don't like the idea of screwing over the common people who are armed.  They don't want us to fight back.  Its that principle in which the US 2nd Amendment to their Constitution was formed.  The way that ""gun nuts"" in America are part of the problem, rather than the solution is that they reject any kind of gun regulation - even the idea of having to go through a registering process when buying or selling firearms.

We play the same violent video games, and so on... 
How different is our culture in this respect? or am i missing something...

Britain lived under the threat of the IRA's brand of terror, but we were never sold guns ""for protection"".

The fact is that the 2nd Amendment was hijacked long ago by the Arms manufacturing industry and has been used to drive sales in the domestic market ever since.

In the light of these tragedies the NRA spout the mantra of 
""the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun, is a good guy with a gun"" - great! so two sales for the price of one!



The only reason America has not cleaned up its act and implemented tougher restrictions is because the gun lobby knows its going to reduce sales.

It doesn't really matter how great his views/principles are -- being a straight talker makes you easy to ridicule and it also increases your chances of alienating people. 

Some people will inevitably be offended by some of these suggestions, regardless of whether or not it is the actual plan. And it's enough to put people off the agenda as whole if you can manage to offend them enough.

I have a lot of friends who disagree, but I just don't agree with a lot of the criticism about her. One friend in particular agrees with you that the show suddenly became the Clara Oswald show, but to that I respond that it was the same exact thing with Amy and Rory. Steven Moffat has very much taken to telling the Doctor's story through the perspective of his companions. After rewatching the show from Series 1 and catching up, I do feel like season 5-7.5 were definitely the Amy show. What's worse is there were a few instances where Amy was very unlikable but we still forgave her because she was the sassy, Scottish companion (prime example: Flesh and Stone).

On the contrary, I do definitely agree that the whole timeline bit muddled things a bit. Part of why I liked Clara in the beginning is that she was very *simple* and very much there by happenstance. It happens a lot throughout the entire series, but I don't like that so many of the characters become the ""chosen one"", speaking in a manner of tropes. I much preferred when Clara was just Clara, not the impossible girl or whatever. It's almost why I loved her as a foil for the doctor. Her simplicity and ordinary-ness was a lot like an anchor that kept the doctor grounded, and once again making her 'the most important person ever' just kinda messed with that a bit.

Up until Edward Snowden ran off to Hong Kong most people thought that the idea of the government spying on **everything** you write online, or say into a phone was tinfoil hat territory.

If you recall the first couple of high-profile ISIS beheadings *(the two journalists)* about a year ago, there was a fair amount of **[fairly credible reporting that those might have been faked](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/bill-gardner/11054488/Foley-murder-video-may-have-been-staged.html)**.  (The linked article contains nothing more graphic of a still from before the beheading and a text description.  It's fairly safe, unless you're extremely squeamish.)

I have seen that video and when it says, *‚ÄúAfter enhancements, the knife can be seen to be drawn across the upper neck at least six times, with no blood evidence to the point the picture fades to black,‚Äù* it's more like a fast sawing motion than 'drawn', but as the article states, 'no blood'.

The **[Tuskegee experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment)** where black men were deliberately ~~infected with~~ *given fake treatment for* syphilis under the pretence of providing healthcare is now a matter of public record.

Even the famous **[MK Ultra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra)** mind control experiments turned out to be true and while I don't recall seeing anything that proved much on the results end, the CIA set up brothels to kidnap men and experiment on them using LSD.  All the files *should* have been destroyed and the evidence only survived because it was misfiled.

Personally I think Sandy Hook truthers are barking up the wrong tree, mainly because they think it was faked.  Personally I think the kind of people who might consider a black flag operation to be useful would hesitate to kill people.  Faking it would just invite discovery.

Writing off all conspiracy theorists as the kind of people who claim aliens abducted them and spent the night probing them is probably the funniest option, but it's not an accurate assumption.

The article itself is about Celtic, but it gives the tables for the payouts for making the group stage and then all games after that (and also some insight into the relative value of the TV revenue share bonus added on to team's base earnings in these competitions).

We've forfeited, likely, at least 3m (when you factor in at least a group stage appearance, a draw [never mind any wins, for arguments sake], and some TV revenue). 

The Arsenal victory made us forget, but some of these numbers are painful to swallow -- especially if we had (as one of the clubs from a bigger league) gotten out of the group stage.

On the other hand, that loss of potential money might mean nothing if we secure a position 4-5 spots higher in the Prem table at the end of the season. But, if we end up 10-13, as per usual, I have to figure that the lack of a chance to even continue the European dream in our last season at the Boleyn hurts more than the lost 1-2m.

To me, it seems like shirt sales are a very, very small part of revenue for the club (especially for a single player), so it seems almost like an irrelevant part of the equation.  I've read a litany of nuts-and-bolts articles that support this viewpoint, as well, so I'm not just pulling this out of thin air.

You smile, but say nothing‚Äîwaiting for Squane to continue. He will want to know your price.

But Squane is staring out to sea, squinting at something on the horizon . . . then he suddenly turns back to you and starts talking very fast about how he always wanted to be a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi, but politics got in the way . . . ‚ÄúAnd now, goddamn it, we must get these last few votes . . .‚Äù

You smile again, itching to get serious. But Squane suddenly yells at somebody across the pool, then turns back to you and says: ‚ÄúJesus, Virgil, I‚Äôm really sorry about this, but I have to run. That guy over there is delivering my new Jensen Interceptor.‚Äù He grins and extends his hand again. Then: ‚ÄúSay, maybe we can talk later on, eh? What room are you in?‚Äù

‚Äú1909.‚Äù

He nods. ‚ÄúHow about seven, for dinner? Are you free?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

‚ÄúWonderful,‚Äù he replies. ‚ÄúWe can take my new Jensen for a run up to Palm Beach . . . It‚Äôs one of my favorite towns.‚Äù

‚ÄúMine too,‚Äù you say. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard a lot about it.‚Äù

He nods. ‚ÄúI spent some time there last February . . . but we had a bad act, dropped about twenty-five grand.‚Äù

Jesus! Jensen Interceptor; twenty-five grand . . . Squane is definitely big-time.

‚ÄúSee you at seven,‚Äù he says, moving away.



The knock comes at 7:02‚Äîbut instead of Squane it‚Äôs a beautiful silver-haired young girl who says J. D. sent her to pick you up. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs having a business dinner with the senator and he‚Äôll join us later at the Crab House.‚Äù

‚ÄúWonderful, wonderful‚Äîshall we have a drink?‚Äù

She nods. ‚ÄúSure, but not here. We‚Äôll drive over to North Miami and pick up my girlfriend . . . but let‚Äôs smoke this before we go.‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus! That looks like a cigar!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is!‚Äù she laughs. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôll make us both crazy.‚Äù



Many hours later. 4:30 AM. Soaking wet, falling into the lobby, begging for help: no wallet, no money, no ID. Blood on both hands and one shoe missing, dragged up to the room by two bellboys . . .

Breakfast at noon the next day, half sick in the coffee shop‚Äîwaiting for a Western union   money order from the wife in St. Louis. Very spotty memories from last night.

‚ÄúHi there, Virgil.‚Äù

J. D. Squane, still grinning. ‚ÄúWhere were you last night, Virgil? I came by right on the dot, but you weren‚Äôt in.‚Äù

‚ÄúI got mugged‚Äîby your girlfriend.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh? Too bad. I wanted to nail down that ugly little vote of yours.‚Äù

‚ÄúUgly? Wait a minute . . . That girl you sent; we went someplace to meet you.‚Äù

‚ÄúBullshit! You double-crossed me, Virgil! If we weren‚Äôt on the same team I might be tempted to lean on you.‚Äù

Rising anger now, painful throbbing in the head. ‚ÄúFuck you, Squane! I‚Äôm on nobody‚Äôs team! If you want my vote you know damn well how to get it‚Äîand that goddamn dope-addict girlfriend of yours didn‚Äôt help any.‚Äù

Squane smiles heavily. ‚ÄúTell me, Virgil‚Äîwhat was it you wanted for that vote of yours? A seat on the federal bench?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre goddamn fuckin‚Äô-A right! You got me in bad trouble last night, J. D. When I got back here, my wallet was gone and there was blood on my hands.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. You beat the shit out of her.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook at these photographs, Virgil. It‚Äôs some of the most disgusting stuff I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù

‚ÄúPhotographs?‚Äù

Squane hands them across the table.

‚ÄúOh my God!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs what I said, Virgil.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! This can‚Äôt be me! I never saw that girl! Christ, she‚Äôs only a child!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why the pictures are so disgusting, Virgil. You‚Äôre lucky we didn‚Äôt take them straight to the cops and have you locked up.‚Äù Pounding the table with his fist. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs rape, Virgil! That‚Äôs sodomy! With a child!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Virgil‚Äîand now you‚Äôre going to pay for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow? What are you talking about?‚Äù

Squane smiling again. ‚ÄúVotes, my friend. Yours and five others. Six votes for six negatives. Are you ready?‚Äù

Tears of rage in the eyes now. ‚ÄúYou evil sonofabitch! You‚Äôre blackmailing me!‚Äù

‚ÄúRidiculous, Virgil. Ridiculous. I‚Äôm talking about coalition politics.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know six delegates. Not personally, anyway. And besides, they all want something.‚Äù

Squane shakes his head. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me about it, Virgil. I‚Äôd rather not hear. Just bring me six names off this list by noon tomorrow.

null,null,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"&gt; In comparison I think it is very rare to hear anyone in the UK talk about carrying a weapon to prevent a mugging or home invasion (which I'm not sure are even that common over here).

I was attacked and beaten by three men who demanded I given them my phone and wallet a few years ago.  It was a terrifying experience, enhanced by the fact it wasn't random, they waited for my in a poorly lit alley I walked past on my way home.  *(I finished work about seven o'clock each day and so I walked home at about the same time each day, after catching a train.)*

I carried a Stanley knife with me for about a week afterwards, because I was constantly furious and frightened **all** the time.  After that I bought a Maglite torch that held four D cell batteries and bought Duracell batteries, purely because they were heavier than any other brand.

First off, I didn't tell anyone about the knife.  I knew it was illegal and it's emasculating to admit you were beaten and that now you're pathetically afraid and constantly on the edge of curling up and crying and that all that's holding that off is the anger.  So that will be a part of why you don't hear people talking about carrying a weapon.

Secondly, it's probably just as well that I didn't have access to a gun.  I would have seriously considered buying one.  Scared, angry people are probably the exact people who shouldn't be walking around with guns.  Anyone who thinks they need a gun as an 'equaliser' and who imagines fighting off a home invasion is probably right there.",null,0,null,1440621196,null,null,false,0,cugojkm,null,t3_3ihl6c,null,null,null,t1_cugkm6o,null,null,null,1441515174,null,43,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,43,null

No, your best options (other than buying all the DVD's legally) are either piracy or shady streaming sites. Daily Motion has a bunch of episodes (maybe all?), but it's potato quality.

One thing I would advise on if you do decide to go the sequential path to watching classic Who is that you read along with a blog.

In a word: homesteading.

When our distant ancestors settled these islands they did so in the stone age. We'd wiped out almost all of the dangerous wildlife in the age of the sword &amp; we also implemented systems of law during roughly the same time. There just hasn't been any historic need to own a gun in the UK.

Contrast to the US where you got millions of people heading out west &amp; staking a claim in the early days of the modern nation. They had to hunt for food/furs and deal with multiple kinds of dangerous animals like grizzly bears doing the same. There also was the general lawlessness of the region and the natives being somewhat unamused in response to that whole genocide thing. 

All of this done in the age of the gun so owning a gun became an integral part of US society. Add to that their revolution, fought with muskets, and it's now a major part of their culture. The image of the self-sufficient homesteader is a pretty big theme in the US.

&gt;The fact is that the 2nd Amendment was hijacked long ago by the Arms manufacturing industry and has been used to drive sales in the domestic market ever since.

This is exactly part of the reason why the culture is different. I can't go into detail because I don't know the detail well enough, it's likely a combination of factors with this being a fairly large one. 

In the same way that car companies in America helped create their car culture and [create crimes like Jaywalking](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26073797) which isn't a crime at all here and a normal part of our culture.

Every year companies which are part of the scheme agree sales figures in advance. At the end of the year, the NHS compares the amount that it has spent with the various companies with the agreed amount. There is almost always an overspend, which the NHS claws back.

(This is a simplification, as the scheme is complicated).

I played centre half from 12-15 for Motherwell never made the cut but still play in Sunday League to this day. One thing people just dont acknowledge about defending is it a 100% team endeavour. Ok the ocassional great tackle can be a one man show, but no matter how good your positioning is, no matter how good your marking is, if your team m8s dont do their bit; you fail as a unit and you all look bad.

People heap the pressure on VVD because he is the star but he is only as strong as the defenders around him and they are all shite. I cant recall more than 5 individual errors from VVD that resulted in a goal, but I could name you 10 out the top of my head for ambrose, and I could name 3 for boyata already. When partnered with another quality CB in Denyer his class showed because they both done their separate bits perfectly making them both look amazing.

I've been the best player in a defensive partnership and I've been the worst, and while letting your team m8 down sucks, as long as you can say you did your best you get over it, but I've never been more unhappy/Demoralised when I do my job perfectly only to be let down by those around me. Vvd experienced this all too often.

You asserted that gun control is relevant to the middle east situation, specifically Syria. You brought it up, I'm asking you to expand. You can admit to hyperbole, we're a friendly bunch and I'm sure you'll be forgiven.

&gt;third is most likely beyond what little you know of military tactics, 

I'll concede that my military service was some years ago, and the doctrine I learnt was more cold war than asymmetric warfare, but I'm entirely confident that a platoon of well armed and well supported professional soldiers will not be hanging about against some good old boys with hunting rifles and sidearms.

If you're going to talk about IEDs and other tactics, those fall outside the scope of gun control and are meaningless to your argument.

&gt;Both are ture. Its to defend against a corrupt/illegal gov't, and in this case its so you can use the exact same level of aggression that theu are using.


That makes literally no sense.

&gt;I betting some people in my town having guns versus nome makes it hard for a platoon to clear it. Think about it.

Having said all that I've just switched to 3 because their 3p/min, 2p/text, 1p/MB PAYG deal pisses all over all the other players for PAYG at the moment, for my usage pattern at least.

An honourable mention for EE though. It seems to have by far the best coverage hereabouts (and pretty much everywhere we go).

No, by reducing the number of guns full stop, though I would imagine that would lower the number of legal gun-owners as well, yes.

&gt;So then make it illegal to lose a gun, why would you simply choose to ban the gun?

Because preventing hand guns from getting into the country in the first place is a far simpler and more effective than criminalising the act of having your guns stolen. In the grand scale of things supporting the hobby of a few people is not as important as attempting to reduce murder rates.

&gt;What does any of your second paragraph have to do with my point? Gun control does not prevent the illegal ownership of guns, and they're entirely unrelated. We can talk about Jamaica (which is surrounded by a body of water, like us) if you want too.

Some money from share sales goes to the broker, some is paid in tax but the rest tends to go to the company who then redistribute it I believe. Sometimes the shares will also be dostrobuted in bonuses  (see Tim Cook as an example). If you keep your money tied up you're risking the share price not recover to the point at which you bough it - though it could rise back up even and you could make a profit. It's a gamble. Essentially yes, as you said, the fear is the price won't recover and you'll lose money, which for investors is a big problem. For example, say pension company A brings in ¬£100M from in revenue not including share revenue. Imagine also per year they bring in ¬£50m in share income on top of that.

The CBF? Honestly, I really like it. From what I gather from people I talk to it's very similar to the Bandit both in styling, weight and performance. People say it's not the most exciting of bikes and I'm sure they're right, but it will still give you a lot of fun if you know where to look for it. It's an inline four, so a lot of power comes from the mid-high rev ranges (which coming from a YBR is something I didn't necessarily expect) - so the first few months of owning the CBF was spent pootling around at &lt;5k RPM and wondering why the bike felt sluggish. Ever since I've got my head around that it's been a blast. Well built, very easy to maintain and extremely easy to get parts for. Accessories are a little tricky as it isn't the most common of bikes but there are lots of places online that do bits and pieces that fit the CBF600.

It also restricts *very* well - the fella who I bought it from said that when he was riding it back from the garage he didn't notice any difference in the low-mid rev ranges - it was only once you got past 8k that you noticed it. I certainly haven't ever felt that it's held me back (being on an A2 it's got some carb washers in it) and on my commute, I very rarely open the throttle more than half and it still flies.

The only downsides are its weight really. It's a heavy bike, but is very nimble and easy to flick around once you're used to it. Low speeds are perfectly do'able, but take some practice.

None of these address mental health. So how are these people getting guns since most are federal offenders which will revoke the ability to get guns legally. The blame is put in many places but it usually comes down to the fact they are buying stolen guns or are stealing them directly. Also you could look at where these crimes are happening it's all around public projects and gang influenced areas. Where I live now is safer than were I lived in Cheltenham to put a perspective on how isolated gun crime is in Chicago.

A lot. There is a series of more than 70 novels, 4 Graphic novels and over 100 hours of audio stories (so far) that are set between those two, as well as selection of short stories.

&gt; Was this when the Time War happened?

Yes. However, basically, none of the novels, audios or comics cover it (well there is one novel that is definitely set during it). Some of them do feature *a* time war though, which *might* be part of the same conflict, seen from another angle.

&gt;I'm just a little bummed that we didn't see the transition between the 8th and 9th Doctor.

Keep watching. When you get to the end of Series 7 and *The Name of the Doctor*, make sure that you watch the mini-sode *The Night of the Doctor* before you go on to *The Day of the Doctor*.

Second, since it isn't part of our constitution, it doesn't have the same intrinsic reverence whereby it is viewed on the same level as being able to worship whoever you want or to preserve habeus corpus. This allows us to take a more sensible approach with regards to legislation, since guns themselves aren't an inherent right but rather the freedom to own them is the right. Shifting the focus from the gun to the generic freedom allows for the court to more easily justify section 1 of our charter, which allows for justifiable limits to be placed on rights. Everyone already accepts limitations on our freedom, like having to wear a seatbelt or get a driver's license, and so we are more open to the idea of restricting our freedom because that's the focus point. Last, we don't have the same cowboy culture, of the man who goes out into the wild to forge his own path in a new and lawless world.

I actually know Conor Hourihane as well so if he'd have scored itd been worse for me. How Naismith finished that game is beyond me. The man is terrible he broke up loads of our attacks tonight it was truly shocking. No where near Everton quality but it's alright because he runs all around and works dead hard even though he has no quality whatsoever. Thought it was very harsh on Pennington to be subbed off he was looking really good in my opinion and Naismith should've gone off instead. Clevs filled in at right back well though although he didn't have much to do. Rom was a bit poo until their defenders got tired and then he terrorised them. Ross and Geri were absolutely superb off the bench much like how Mirallas was last year against West Ham. Completely changed the game and if I were Deulofeu I'd feel very hard done by if he doesn't start against Spurs. 3 assists for the lad speaks for itself. I think it's clear that something isn't right with Stones. He was fairly bad for most of the game so this whole thing is obviously effecting him negatively. It's best for everyone if it doesn't drag out so if he's going just go but if he's staying the club need to make a statement as soon as possible.

The BBC is still comfortably up there with our best institutions - I would say that publicly owned Channel 4, the FT and on a good day the Guardian are also decent. Issues at the BBC are at worst a sympton of a much wider problem.

I would say the BBC is at least as well regarded globally as it ever was, except to the extent that the World Service is less relevant now that it has lost a sort of natural monopoly over the service it provides.

That Cameron - or indeed anyone who does - can criticise the BBC's bias while turning a blind eye to the Murdoch press is baffling. That the Left singles the BBC out even when it leans further left than any British source of journalism with a degree of merit and mass circulation is equally weird.

Its hands are pretty much tied in that the BBC *has* to follow a moderate mainstream agenda or it will be accused of bias - and even when it does that it's still criticised from both sides.

null,null,Everton_11,crest,The Lukaku Strikes Back,null,"My heart's racing. Wow. That said, absolute class performance from Barnsley. They knew what was coming, and they fought tooth and nail for it. Well done.

As for us. Oh, where to start?

Joel had a terrible night, frankly. I think he's partially at fault for the first two, and just never looked like he had it in him. The one moment that comes to mind is the shot straight at him that he couldn't hold and just spilled it. It's tough to be a backup keeper, no doubt, but he needs to show a little more to keep challenging for a place.

The defense was appalling. Jags, after an abysmal first half got back into it, made several crucial clearances, and two mammoth blocks late on against Rothwell, I think. Stones, WTF, man? No reason to jump over the ball, looked nervous, ost the ball, misplayed passes, I'm not sure I've seen a worse showing from him in an Everton shirt. Oviedo got caught out badly several times, but it's his first start since, what, February? Tough to be too harsh on him. Pennington looked good, composed, crossed well, passed well, didn't panic. He looks to have a bright future ahead, and it was a hsame to see him off at half, but it was needed.

Cleverley looked solid, but it did take him five or ten minutes to adapt at right back, which nearly cost us, but overall, a solid game.  Mo was all action, and while should be held partially at fault for the third goal, also hasn't played much, and is just recovering from that hamstring injury, so I'm ok with his performance. 

McGeady was, well, dire, to put it politely. One obvious missed chance, another clearly telegraphed, lost the ball. A day for him to forget. He has the capability to be a great playero n his day, but it wasn't today.  Kev had a great game drifting around behind Lukaku. Tracked back well, and scored a fantastic goal. 

Rom looked really really good up front. Held up the ball, ran with it well, and kept composed to score a pair. All around great performance from him.

As for Geri and Ross, fantastic performances from them both. Cameo n at half and really changed the game. Geri's got the capability to be a real x-factor, and he showed it brilliantly today. Three assists is really, really impressive. I know Ross didn't get on the score sheet, but he really drove the team forward, always wanted the ball, and just kept running. Great day from him. One of those two deserves MOTM, but hell if I can figure out which.

Macca came on a little to late to do much, but didn't mess up, so decent from him.

As for Martinez, I don't think he can be blamed for the first half showing, and he found the right players to change it up in the second half, so credit to him for once again utilizing his bench in a really solid way.

Overall, a good performance up front, and very shaky at the back. But what a display from Barnsley. Hats off to all of them.

What constitutes the establishment is, of course, always the opponents of those complaining about it. To right-wing voters the establishment are political correct liberals imposing their will though the media, silencing right-wing voices and promoting programs which promote a left-wing agenda. Left-wingers however see the establishment as a neoliberal conspiracy between bankers, politicians and rich newspaper barons.  In the UK the biggest one is the BBC which is both a left-wing politically correct organisation or the voice of neoliberalism depending on which side you're on. 

The idea of course is that once you've convinced your supporters that everyone else is against you then it's easier to further convince them that negative stories and criticism is part of that agenda and thus easier to discount. It does actually work similar to a cult in that in tries to discredit and distance the follower/supporter from those outside of it. 

Ironically where people used to put too much of their faith into newspapers we've now gone to far the other way where people put far too much faith into a campaign, candidate or ideology. People are more polarised and less self-critical. I think this is dangerous.

I think I always ask Corbyn supporters is this: When the story came out about him attending an memorial for Palestine organised by a holocaust denier, a story he denied the day before, would you have been as dismissive of the story had that been Farage? 

When Farage was contemplating doing an alliance with a party in the EU whose leader had similar views he was rightly attacked for that.

Levy has the unfortunate habit of costing Spurs in the long term by saving them money in the short term.

Levy put us in the position we are in today by only bringing in Ryan Nelsen and Louis Saha in the January 2012 transfer window. On January 31st, we were in 3rd, 7 points clear of Chelsea and 13 points clear of Arsenal. Instead of bringing in actual players who could help the team, Levy cheaped out with two free transfers. As everyone probably knows, Chelsea won the CL, and the PL season ended with Arsenal 1 point ahead of us, and even on goal differential. One goal could have secured 3rd place. Instead, 4th place got Europa League.

As a result of missing out on Champions League, Modric left for Real Madrid. When it came time to find his replacement, Levy fucked up the deal with Porto for Moutinho by haggling over an amount that was less than 10% of the total transfer fee. The deal didn't get done by midnight, and Spurs are still looking today for a true central midfield playmaker. (Footnote: Haggling cost us Benteke, and we ended up with Soldado. Great choice there Levy)

After Modric left, the plan changed to building around Bale. No player signed after Modric left was older than 25. The plan was to build a squad that could compete for the PL title when those players hit their prime in 2-3 years. In January 2013, we were in 4th place, 4 points clear of Arsenal. In the January window, we brought in Holtby (essentially on a free) and Fryers. Neither were the players we needed, and Bale was forced to continue carrying the team. Once Kyle Walker made that incredibly, incredibly stupid (seriously, so dumb) backpass at Liverpool, the season was essentially over. We finished 5th, 1 point behind Arsenal.

Then, last summer, Levy capitulated to Real Madrid and sold Bale. This move set Tottenham back 20 years. Bale is the 3rd best player in the world. Bale would be irreplaceable for any team, but even moreso for a team like Tottenham, who refuse to/can't pay the wages a World Top 10 player demands. As you saw, even with the money from the Bale sale, we couldn't find players to properly replace him. Oh, and if you've been wondering why Paulinho has been such a fuckhead all season? In an interview before his transfer was official, he talked about how excited he was to move to England and play with Bale, who he said was staying. He was recruited with the promise of playing with a superstar, only to have the player sold before he arrived to the team. Bale's departure has been detrimental to the team, not only competitively, but in regards to locker room morale as well. Bale's departure has had the exact opposite effect on the locker room (and the fans for that matter) that Ozil's transfer to Arsenal had.

That makes it very hard for criminals to store, transport and use illegal firearms. All of those things would be far easier in a country where there is a stock of legal firearms to operate within.

null,null,JohnMulroy,num20,,null,"&gt;Levy put us in the position we are in today by only bringing in Ryan Nelsen and Louis Saha in the January 2012 transfer window. On January 31st, we were in 3rd, 7 points clear of Chelsea and 13 points clear of Arsenal. Instead of bringing in actual players who could help the team, Levy cheaped out with two free transfers. As everyone probably knows, Chelsea won the CL, and the PL season ended with Arsenal 1 point ahead of us, and even on goal differential. One goal could have secured 3rd place. Instead, 4th place got Europa League.

Redknapp had one of the best squads in the league and allowed a team that was 13 points behind us to catch up and this is all Levy's Fault? Redknapp always plays victim despite the fact that he was offered suarez and Aguero and turned them down.

&gt;As a result of missing out on Champions League, Modric left for Real Madrid. When it came time to find his replacement, Levy fucked up the deal with Porto for Moutinho by haggling over an amount that was less than 10% of the total transfer fee. The deal didn't get done by midnight, and Spurs are still looking today for a true central midfield playmaker. (Footnote: Haggling cost us Benteke, and we ended up with Soldado. Great choice there Levy)

Modric didnt leave for CL football, he left because it was Real Madrid. Moutinho was never really confirmed to be on the cards and hasnt really been that good for Monaco.

&gt;After Modric left, the plan changed to building around Bale. No player signed after Modric left was older than 25. The plan was to build a squad that could compete for the PL title when those players hit their prime in 2-3 years. In January 2013, we were in 4th place, 4 points clear of Arsenal. In the January window, we brought in Holtby (essentially on a free) and Fryers. Neither were the players we needed, and Bale was forced to continue carrying the team. Once Kyle Walker made that incredibly, incredibly stupid (seriously, so dumb) backpass at Liverpool, the season was essentially over. We finished 5th, 1 point behind Arsenal.

We had a great squad in 2013, I dont see how levy not spending millions was a bad thing. 

&gt;Then, last summer, Levy capitulated to Real Madrid and sold Bale.

Bale wanted to leave and Levy got the world record fee for him. 20 year set back is arbitrary.

In particular his focus upon public violence against women is really, really weird. I don't know anyone in the women's sector who would rate public violence against women as either a more serious problem violence within the home or within relationships, let alone as a separate policy area.

The train segregation policy is also completely mad, that he even proposed it publicly shows he hasn't talked to any of the stakeholders about this or thought about it seriously as a policy.

&gt;Work together with local authorities, universities, transport authorities, police, and women‚Äôs campaigns to tackle harassment in public places? Yes. Why aren‚Äôt we already doing this? 

Because the Tories suck. But what Corbyn proposed is both too narrow a focus, and what he outlined was specifically to discuss - such measures should be to corordinate strategy and strategy and policy across different tiers and sectors of government for all kinds of domestic violence, not talking shop summits.

Incidentally Wales are doing this and have a rather interesting model given their limited devolved powers.

null,null,Tective,null,null,null,"The UK had fairly minimal firearms laws, comparable to those of the US until about 1920.  At this point those in power feared rising worker resentment and whatnot (this was a time of poverty and dissatisfaction, plus the worker's revolution in Russia and rising anti-capitalist/anti-establishment sentiment).  Hence legislation to remove guns from the average person.  It's only fairly recently (the nineties, with Dunblane?) that this has been rephrased as a safety measure, when originally it was more another example of good old British class warfare - best in the world.

Regarding ""sensible"" firearms laws, I think they might have gone a little too far at this point.  It's silly that the olympic shooting team has to go abroad to train.  And how Scotland is about to require a Firearms Certificate to own an air rifle.  Air rifles are in no way shape or forms firearms, it's daft.  How many of us grew up with an air gun?  I'd like to see more intelligent laws allowing citizens to own for the purpose of sport - not self defence, not whatever, but sport.  I mean, the Channel Islands still allows handguns, and they've been fine.  Northern Ireland allows you to own handguns, shotguns and rifles.  We're lucky in that, unlike the Americans, we don't have a constitution blocking any and all change, nor do we have a multi-million arms industry (although Britain has a very proud history of leading firearms innovation, but let's ignore that I suppose).  That means that we have the space to put together intelligent gun laws without having to work around any conflicts.

*That* means we can find the sweet spot between letting hobbyists own what they want without letting the crazies do the same.  If you ask me, a licensing system is the way to go, with strict mental health and background checks, competency tests (prove you can handle a firearm responsibly, what would you do in this situation, or if this happens etc.) and having put all reasonable safeguards in place, the list of free-to-own calibres and weapons should be expanded back up to keep up to date with modern times.  Remember that we are confirming as much as we possibly can that the owners of the firearms are intelligent, responsible citizens - it doesn't matter whether they shoot .22 at their range or .50, so long as they are shooting at the range, neither does any harm to anybody.  In this way we maximize the chance of keeping the guns out of the hands of those who would do harm, while also empowering our citizens to live the life they want to live.  There is no difference between playing a video game for fun, and shooting at targets on a range for fun.  We don't really get to choose what we enjoy doing, and it sucks that one group of people gets marginalised for the actions of a few (*very* few).",null,0,null,1440626013,null,null,false,0,cugrpja,null,t3_3ihl6c,null,null,null,t3_3ihl6c,null,null,null,1441516665,null,27,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,27,null

[We've been linked](https://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/2v7qkd/post_jan_14151516_summer_transfer_window/) to a fuck ton of players. Tell me, should the club sign all of them? Notice I haven't even bothered updating it for 2 months to the day and that's still about 125 players linked.

&gt; Net loss? 17 million euros

You can only lose money when you spend it. Fact is *if* the likes of Lamela and co worked out, you wouldn't be making this. Unfortunately, that's the reality of football, most transfers don't make it. Bostock was the next big thing, look how he turned out. So was Bentley. But so was Bale and Modric. Fact is things *will* go wrong.

*Oh and this is what the new team has been brought in for - to identify talent before they're bigger names and out of reach. So Levy's doing what you want, yet you're giving him shit for it.

&gt;. Levy is costing this club a MINIMUM of 10 points every season through his ineffective transfer dealings. 

So I take it we should hire you to ensure 100% that every single transfer works out? Your opinion on a player is never wrong I assume.

&gt; Why are we playing a CB at CDM

He played there at Sporting if I'm not mistaken. [Looked it up](http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/everything-you-need-know-about-spurs-new-boy-eric-dier) - ""even allowing him to perform the holding midfielder role competently"" - so yeah.

&gt; Until Levy is willing to pay the market value for players

This club isn't Man U/City/Real/Barca. The club doesn't have the funds to do that, especially with a ¬£400m stadium on the way.

&gt;and will end up paying the same amount of money for multiple lesser players (coughBalecough).

Funny, I remember how people were saying it was a good transfer window. Hindsight's 20/20 isn't it?


&gt;you do things like drop 7 of your first 9 points

11/12 the team dropped 6/9 then [this](http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/matchday/league-table.html?season=2011-2012&amp;month=FEBRUARY&amp;timelineView=date&amp;toDate=1329004800000&amp;tableView=CURRENT_STANDINGS) happened. Granted it all went down hill from there, but you're acting like the season's over. 

&gt; Until Levy is willing to pay the market value for players, we will continue to miss out on superstars

You do realise the club can't actually buy superstars right? Which superstars would go to a club without CL?

&gt;Levy is killing the product on the pitch for the sake of balancing the books

That's funny, I would agree with you if the club didn't spend the Bale money, but it did.

&gt; Tottenham is a business to him, not a football club. 

This makes no sense. Let's assume it is, a business only adds value if it's getting better...... That lines up directly with what the supporters want.

&gt; I fear we will never again see a team that plays as well as the CL team of Modric, Rafa, Bale, Ledley etc. 

""give me CL now qq"" OP I hope I'm not jumping the gun here but you sound like you're fairly recent. You would've hated the mid-table/bottom half finishes not too long ago.  

Not to mention Levy bought those players in. ""I fear Levy won't give me a team of players like the ones he bought because he wouldn't buy them"". wat

Two things stop me storing my guns at the club, guns are stored at my club (in locked cupboards within a purpose built vault) but space is always limited. And the police are reluctant to allow an increase in size without prohibitive cost due to the risk of dozens of firearms (rather than one or two) being stolen at once.  The other is, I don't alway shoot at the same location, if my guns were stored at the club, I (and every other member with firearms stored there) would want keys to collect our guns at odd times of week (my club is open Mon evening, Weds Morning, Friday Evening, but other local ranges are open weekends, other evenings), to shoot practice or competition at different ranges.  This would mean more people with keys to a large armoury which could be lost.

It was proposed by the shooting community at the time of the 97 ban, specifically for pistols like those abused by the man in Dunblaine that one of the working parts of pistols could be stored at a club, (one of, bolt, slide, barrel, cylinder etc) with the rest of the firearm kept by the owner.  This could work (such things could be kept in small private lockers, rather than the main vault), but is impractical for many long guns (the one I intend to buy requires 10-15 minutes of disassembly to remove any of the main working parts, and a similar period of reassembly, most pistols however can have a major part removed in under 60 seconds with practice)",null,0,null,1440626644,null,null,false,0,cugs3we,null,t3_3ihl6c,null,null,null,t1_cugpk3h,null,null,null,1441516853,null,11,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

Given that Sinn Fein and the DUP are the biggest parties they control the passage of legislation and the UUP has only one minister in government.  The UUP therefore has relatively little power to lose from entering opposition and is distancing itself from a stormont government which is disfunctional so to say the least.  

It's also a fair point that a political system needs an opposition in the assembly to hold government to account. 

The issue of PIRA members carrying out a murder and the status of PIRA is probably something of a pretext.  It makes it appear to unionist voters that it is taking a strong line against Sinn Feins association with PIRA and continued paramilitary violence.  Basically it's a cause everyone can get behind.

Cheapest one beds are around ¬£750 but they will go on the same day they are advertised. Studios can be had for around ¬£650, but they go quickly too. Brighton is a massively competitive rental market and there are lots of people who don't earn a great deal. So anything at the cheaper end of the market goes very, very quickly. If you do look at anywhere it's a good idea to have a holding deposit in your pocket so you can claim it there and then. About ¬£300 is normal. 
     
You're definitely going have to share on your budget. Or find someone who wants a lodger. Friday-Ad and Gumtree might work for you. Your university should have someone looking after student housing. Create a Rightmove account and set up alerts for places within your budget. Rightmove also has a facility to email your search to all the agencies in the area. Some of them are good and will respond, some are not so good.   
   
You could also widen your search. Lewes, Newhaven and Seaford to the East, Burgess Hill and Haywards Heath to the North, and Portslade, Southwick, Lancing, and Worthing to the West all have good transport links to Brighton. But, if you want the Brighton experience they're not going to be much use to you. I've lived around here for a long time and Lewes and Portslade are the only ones I'd consider moving to. The Daily Mail sells well in the others.   

Edit: One thing I've found is that price is not linked to quality. I've seen some damp, shitty holes go for the same price as lovely, clean places you'd gladly take your mum to. Just because you've seen one dump in a price range doesn't mean everything at that price is crappy.

(Speaking as a white male, though I'm not sure that's particularly relevant)

&gt;  [I went to a public school] that was obsessed with awarding women and minorities above the hardest working people.

I'm not sure women and minorities do work less. If this is in reference to positive discrimination though, whilst it might be damaging in the short term, the long term reward is a society where both sexes can feel more comfortable picking subjects which pay higher.

&gt; [S]eeing idiots get rewarded whist I was ignored was extremely damaging to my self esteem and effected me for the much of high school.

I think the main argument goes that whilst going from a A to an A* is important, many feel that going from a C to an A is a lot more enabling. 

&gt; This is a first world country, we don't need bloody segregated carriages and quotas like you'd see in India or other third world poverty-ridden despots

This is just a conversation, which as /u/rulzscar mentions, was suggested by some women.

&gt; This is both an insult to 'privileged men' who are viewed as purely the oppressors, dispute having higher suicide and incarceration rates. 

I agree here, seems like a valid point to raise issues in regards to men being homeless, unemployed, divorced, victims of violence, depressed/suicidal, etc. I do feel that rape, domestic violence and child support law should be made more inclusive so men feel more open about reporting cases. That doesn't stop me from supporting some women's rights campaigns though, including legislation about rape and encouraging foreign law to reform, for example. 

&gt;  And oppressed women/ minority groups who despite being equal in the eyes of the law

What laws are you referring too here, bar maybe from the discrimination laws we have in employment?

null,null,zPhix,mccoy,McCoy,null,"The TV Movie begins with the Seventh Doctor near the end of his life who soon regenerates into the Eighth Doctor.  It was a pilot for an American produced series that never came to be.  The audios, novels and comics are still being made to this day, and cover every incarnation up to the Twelfth Doctor.

**Comics:**

They were usually made using the ""current"" TV Doctor with the occasional one-off revisiting an older Doctor.  At least until 2014, when Titan got rights to make comics and started an ongoing series for the Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth Doctors.

* TV Comic/Action (1964-1978): *1st-4th Doctor*

* Doctor Who Magazine (1979-Present): *4th-12th Doctor*

* IDW (2008-2013): *10th-11th Doctor*

* Titan (2014-Present): *8th-12th Doctor*

**Novels:**

After the show ended in 1989 the BBC gave Virgin Publishing the rights to make Doctor Who novels.  These rights were reverted back to the BBC after the 1996 TV Movie.  Two of the lines focused on the ""current"" Doctor, while the other two lines revisited older Doctors.

* New Adventures (Virgin, 1991-1997): *7th Doctor*

* Missing Adventures (Virgin, 1994-1997): *1st-6th Doctor*

* Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC, 1997-2005): *8th Doctor*

* Past Doctor Adventures (BBC, 1997-2005): *1st-7th Doctor*

* New Series Adventures (BBC, 2005-Present): *9th-12th Doctor*

**Audio Dramas:**

These are mostly done by Big Finish and feature the original actors in full cast audio plays.  This includes every surviving Doctor and companion from the classic series, except for Dodo.  The first three Doctor's actors are no longer with us, so their stories are usually done with one of the companions from their era in an enhanced audiobook form.  Until recently they only had the rights to pre-2005 material, and so most of their stories feature the first eight Doctors.

* Main/Monthly Range (1999-Present): *5th-8th Doctor*

* Eighth Doctor Adventures (2006-2011): *8th Doctor*

* Companion Chronicles (2007-Present): *1st-8th Doctor*

* Lost Stories (2009-2013): *1st-7th Doctor*

* Fourth Doctor Adventures (2012-Present): *4th Doctor*

* Dark Eyes (2012-2015): *8th Doctor*

* New Adventures of Bernice Summerfield (2014-Present): *7th Doctor*

* Early Adventures (2014-Present): *1st-2nd Doctor*

* Doom Coalition (2015-Present): *8th Doctor*

Studying is accomplished through a few methods that differ depending on the module more than anything else. Independent study in most modules is going to consist of working through the provided course texts and media, answering set questions, and carrying out a variety of exercises through the OU's StudentHome portal.

Aside from this, there are also online tutorial sessions conducted with your tutor and peers in most OU modules, forums for discussion for each module that can be very useful, and your tutor is available directly if you have questions. Some modules have residential components, others have independent fieldwork that you are expected to carry out, but I wouldn't expect the latter in a CS degree.

You get a calendar at the beginning of the module with a schedule of when you should be doing each bit of work, but given that the books for a February presentation are usually delivered in December you have plenty of time to get ahead if you're so inclined.

To cut a long story short, after two years at Leicester full-time, and two flunked years at the OU part-time, I crammed a full year of modules into a single year whilst working nearly full-time and it was a living hell. Don't do it, it's an insane amount of work for one year let alone three. 

Remember that with the OU you have the option of claiming a certificate after your first academic year, a diploma after your second academic year, and a degree without honours halfway through your third academic year before you finally graduate. There's no rush!

Just take it easy, no speeding, double following distance and braking distance. Accelerate a bit slower, allow more time for lane changes, and braking. Bit a bit smoother on the down-shifts. No dropping gears too heavily as you risk locking the rear.

You'll also need to be gentler on the brakes. Watch out for puddles, especially on corners. Be a bit more cautious when filtering.

&gt; Corbynomics should not be as incoherent as it is. Leftwing economic platforms need not be stupid, but proponents must understand their strengths and limitations. So here are some suggestions for Jeremy Corbyn, the hard-left veteran likely to become UK Labour party leader next month.

&gt; There is no left-right dividing line in sensible economic policymaking. Everyone needs to define their ambitions, understand how policy might achieve goals and recognise constraints. Mr Corbyn‚Äôs ambition is clear: [he wants a more equal and a more prosperous society.](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/jeremyforlabour/pages/70/attachments/original/1437556345/TheEconomyIn2020_JeremyCorbyn-220715.pdf?1437556345)

&gt; Since this desire is shared across the political spectrum, the radical left must demonstrate its ability to act where other, more conservative forces, are constrained. The left‚Äôs important freedom is its ability to worry less about preserving individual property rights than others. Such rights are never absolute ‚Äî any form of taxation is lawful extortion ‚Äî and if they stand in the way of growth and greater equality, a leftwing government can remove them. This surely should be the guiding theme of any practical economics of the hard left.

&gt; The constraints are sadly real, however. You can tax the rich until the pips squeak, but if the pips are mobile, you will find the fruit you are squeezing is seedless. Governments can also fail more regularly than markets.

&gt; With this in mind, an economically coherent leftwing platform would weaken the property rights that most impede prosperity, allowing these gains to offset damage from likely government failures and weaker incentives to work and to innovate. Once you are clear about such essentials, it is not too difficult to devise sensible leftwing economic policies.

&gt; Abundant land is disastrously used in Britain, constrained by arbitrary planning constraints and not-in-my-back-yard attitudes of small ‚Äúc‚Äù conservative residents. Greenbelt restrictions protect wasteland around cities, preventing both growth and more affordable housing and ensuring older and richer people, especially around London, entrench their privileges.

&gt; Regulations could be substantially loosened, with the state 
appropriating most of the increase in land value of areas that currently cannot be developed. Many parts of inner cities, often freehold land owned by the public sector, could be rebuilt at higher densities with widespread compulsory purchase. A third runway at Heathrow ‚Äî a pro-growth measure opposed by local property owners ‚Äî should go ahead.

&gt; To be clear, this is a red policy, not a green one. Alongside higher property taxes on those who gained from buying in the right place at the right time, it would efficiently redistribute income and wealth, improving the lives of poorer people.

&gt; Few want a generation of lazy trust-fund children. So, other forms of overt redistribution should include heavier inheritance taxes. These are justified on the twin principles that bequests damage beneficiaries‚Äô work incentives and the dead find the taxman more difficult to avoid than the living. The constraint here is to understand that people will seek to divest their wealth before they meet their maker and even a hard-left government will need to trade off higher revenues against inevitable avoidance.

&gt; In taxation, the left should understand that revenue raising is a collective activity and that to generate sufficient receipts to devote more of the nation‚Äôs resources to the poor, to education, to health or to other public services requires more than a raid on the rich. There are not enough of them. Higher taxes for all, as in Nordic countries, is the solution.

&gt; All of this is economically literate, radical and left wing. Little of this is Corbynomics. For him, there are vast untapped pools of free money, to be accessed via setting up a national investment bank, attacking so-called ‚Äúcorporate welfare‚Äù, engaging in quantitative easing ‚Äúfor the people‚Äù or simply ending austerity.

&gt; That is not a coherent programme for the left, but just another form of populism. And of course it comes with other popular fallacies such as saying the finances of the British state are regressive ‚Äî when it is obvious that poor families receive their income from the state. Slogans are easy to write if you wilfully confuse objectives with policy, making empty statements such as, ‚Äúfaster growth and higher wages must be key to bringing down the deficit‚Äù.

&gt; It is Mr Corbyn‚Äôs populism, not his being hard left, that destroys his economic credibility. A smart hard-left stance could claim to boost both prosperity and equality.

null,null,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"&gt; Did you never get scared that by carrying a knife if you were mugged they might end up stabbing you?

Not really, no.  A Stanley knife would be pretty hard to take away.  The torch I replaced it with carried a far higher risk of it being taken away.  My main concern was simply that I knew that if I were attacked and I carved someone up in self-defence I'd end up in jail for it.

A big heavy torch at least I could justify on the basis I had to walk through a badly lit area to get home.

It was mostly an attempt at seizing some control again.  Being attacked stripped away any sense of safety and security.  You know how you get told, ""Just give them what they ask for?""  There was no demand before the beating.  I saw a shadow move and was immediately punched in the face and then slammed against a car.

I managed to run away and called the police from a nearby shop.  They made it quite clear there was next to no chance of them catching anyone.  I spent nearly four hours in the police station after and I came out of it feeling like I was being accused of lying.  I recognise that that's almost certainly not what happened, but it was in no way reassuring.

Americans sometimes say variations of, ""If guns are illegal only criminals have guns.""  I would estimate that people who go around attacking and robbing people are fairly likely to carry a knife, even if only for intimidation purposes.

At that time *(and this is still fairly true)* I'd prefer to have a chance at hurting someone if I'm going to be hurt anyway.

That aside this is not a black or white issue there is many factors allowing this situation to get where it has gotten recently. The 300 million fires prevents the United States to actually go out and collect the fireams so yes they are many guns available but if you looked into the statistics I bet you would find most are owned by people who have never had any run ins with the law. Then there's the way the the 2nd amendment is written it allows the general public not only to have firearms but the right to form militias. This is why miniguns and flamethrowers are legal in some states. It's to late to reverse the way gun culture has been adopted as normal here.  But on a good note gun crime is actually down overall even with the relaxed gun laws.

The reason I focus on mental and economic issues is due to the recent increase in mass shootings is done normally by a similar type of person.

Every time you move while shooting, you start putting your groupings out. Semi-auto allows you to stay in the exact same position for each shot. Plus you can't do practical shooting with a bolt-action. It's semi-auto only. I've shot competition too.

&gt;And the good reason to ban them is because certain weapons are too concealable and pointable (handguns) and capable of too much damage too quickly (automatics, semi automatic large bore rifles).

And yet crimes involving legal firearms have been low for decades. So low that nearly all gun crime is via illegal firearms. They pose next to no risk to the public.

&gt;Plus, there's no good reason to won them.

There's no good reason for people to own sports cars, or really any car over 1.6L but we don't ban them because we don't actually ban anything based on ""well, you don't absolutely need it"".

Just be careful at the entrances of the roundabouts and do not make sudden movements when you're moving over paint or covers. You will be fine. 

Usually when you slip in the wet, it's not the speed that makes you lose it (although that can happen), it's the surface conditions like oil, diesel, etc., drain covers, or paint and a sudden movement. Diesel is slippery as hell, not a lot you can do about that.

You can go over the covers &amp; paint perfectly fine as long as you're not suddenly making any direction or speed changes, i.e., not putting a lot of forces sideways to those surfaces.

Once you get used to it, riding in the rain can be a lot of fun if you don't mind getting wet. I was out in a severe downpour yesterday in the Chiltern area, it was so much fun. As I climbed into the storm, it got heavier and heavier until suddenly it wasn't and I managed to glimpse a little rainbow before the next rain cloud moved in.

One more thing. Riding in the rain, cold, is a stupid thing. Make sure that you're warm and dry. Try to have your waterproofs and a couple of layers in them. Last year I was coming down from Edinburgh on my LT, warm and happy, doing way over the speed limit in a very heavy rain, watching the storm clouds drift by. Magical.

A Limited company is just that, its members have limited liability over the debts of the company in the event of its inability to pay its debts.  However, to remedy this it may be the case that the directors of the company gave personal guarantees to shore up the business when it took on debt, this is normally to a set limit.  You should check whether any such guarantee is in place.

What may be more relevant, and could be in play given that you mentioned your dad went inside, is something called wrongful or fraudulent trading, where the directors of the company continued to trade knowing that the business would be unable to pay its debts; in such a circumstance the law can pass the debt on to the directors.  I don't know enough about this to comment but I  understand that a burden of proof must be proved by the creditor.

Or, creditors have made a speculative claim.  By your mum making an instalment plan this may mean that she has recognised her own liability for the affairs of the business.  Again, seek professional advice and be prepared to pay for this.  Lawyers or Insolvency practitioners should be able to help, neither of which I am.

In addition, the train you are on is little more then a hype train, the fear and propaganda of the right wing is more than enough to derail it, sending it and potentially, the entire party hurtling into the sun. 

Remember that fear is the only god of that all but a minority of Corbynites, Communists and other Utopians unanimously believe in. If Mr Corbyn and by extension you and his supporters want to live in a UK free from Tory rule and posses real power then the rhetoric must be turned down considerably in order to firstly shield the party from excess right wing flak and allow for groups of people with opposing ideas, e.g. Republicans and Royalists to both view Mr Corbyn as a viable option.

Christ, we made Steven Ireland look like Messi two weeks ago when he came on. Maybe that was due to Kane coming off or the full press breaking down, but the bottom line is that we absolutely need a win this weekend or Poch's job will for sure be under scrutiny by the board.  

If you want me to be more positive, then I will say that Everton struggled against fucking League One Barnsley tonight and even played extra time which will only help us on the weekend. The fact that they scraped out a win is also probably good for us because they won't have that 'we need to bounce back' mentality coming into our matchup.

The rationalisation offered was that a quick death was offered in exchange for saying whatever anti-American thing they were told to say.  Making that offer certainly makes sense.

ISIS displayed real talent for showing off how barbaric and outright degenerate they could be.  There are other videos where they were shooting people at near point blank range.  The entire point is to instil terror and it works, which is why you have events like Iraqi soldiers abandoning their posts and running away.

So, once you accept they're deliberately monstrous a graphic, bloody beheading seems like it's the perfect propaganda for them.  You can't fake it completely, because one day the guy whose head you just hacked off will be seen walking around by someone.

I think the question you're asking (and I note your dad's treatment, none of which quite rings true; I think either something has been lost in the telling, or he should seek legal advice regarding a wrongful arrest) is what's happening to your dog?

Because you've said the dog's been seized for testing, we can only assume that an allegation has been made that he's a banned breed and he looks sufficiently like one that an assessment needs to be made.

If it's decided that he conforms sufficiently closely to a banned breed, then the courts become involved. You'll get a summons, and that's where any decisions could be made. This does not mean that he will be put to sleep, as sometimes they're returned with conditions attached (muzzled, never off lead etc.).

If he's not, he'll be returned to you.

Sorry, but I honestly don't believe you. When you target shoot, you do so with a bolt action. And what on earth do you mean 'can't shoot practically with a bolt action'?! I've hunted and shot targets most of my life, with bolt actions. It's the standard rifle format in the UK, unsurprisingly, since anything self.loading beyond a .22 is prohibited. Self loading rifles are inherently less accurate than bolt action rifles. No one in (target) competition shooting uses them. That's because the block/action starts moving even before the bullet leaves the muzzle, and that introduces movement in the rifle that you cannot control. Muzzle velocities also vary more. = inaccuracy. A bolt action seats the round in the chamber more consistently each time and holds it firm until the shooter cycles it. =more accurate.

As soon as you have any degree of proficiency with a target rifle, you learn how to work the action with minimal (preferably no) disruption to your shooting pose. And that includes picking up the next round from next to the rifle and placing it on the breech, since the rifle has no magazine....

Your other arguments are as well trodden as arguments come. I'm not going to dispute them. I love shooting, I have no desire to own or shoot a handgun, and I am happy with firearms legislation as they stand in the UK. I think they permit enthusiasts to own and enjoy firearms whilst prohibiting those that offer potential to do the most damage in the wrong hands.",null,0,null,1440632542,null,null,false,0,cugvkzk,null,t3_3ihl6c,null,null,null,t1_cugu643,null,null,null,1441518496,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I condemn all violence in general but I would struggle to condemn those who decided to take up arms considering the circumstances of the time. People have to defend themselves, and there are people on both sides who felt they needed to do that. There are also many people who went far beyond defence and people who murdered senselessly. I don't buy into much of the propaganda on either side, there are stories that both sides can tell that would justify what people did to some extent. It doesn't serve any of us any good to try and claim one group as being morally superior to the other. I think we'd be doing a lot better in this country if more people were able to share these differing perspectives to recognise why people did what they did. This is why you still get people with sectarian attitudes, who have lived their entire lives in their Republican or Loyalist bubbles, and not ventured out to hear what others have to say.

I work hard for what I have and if you don't like your circumstances then you should work hard too just like I did.  Why should I have to pay for your health care when you didn't work for it?  What many people don't realize is this is a downright ignorant argument because people are already paying for the uninsured person's health care whether they want to or not.  That's why if you got to the doctor and they give you tylenol it costs $300.00 when you can go to the local store and buy 500 of them for $5.00.  They have to jack up the price to cover those people who get treatment and then can not pay for it.  Nationalized health care makes sense but people don't want to hear that.  

People are starting to warm up to the idea that mental health treatment needs to be a priority but many people are still hesitant to go.  Again that goes back to both the stigma and health insurance.  There's also the issue that you're going to have to talk about painful things and Americans just don't like to feel bad about anything.  We want to be all smiles, puppy dogs, and rainbows all the time and that's just not reality.  However, it's the reality that is shoved down our throats all the time and asking for help is seen by some not as a sign of strength but as a sign of weakness.  You can't handle your own shit and it's as simple as that.  My other favorite thing to hear from people is just give all your problems to God.  If you just pray hard enough it'll all work out.  I respect that some people find comfort in that but if you're in so much distress that your day to day functioning is suffering then you need a doctor and not god.

We also have to talk about other issues like jobs.  Most Americans don't have a 40 hour work week but are working 50, 60, or more hours a week.  Some companies don't offer sick days or vacation days and if you do take them you're sometimes viewed as not a dedicated worker and it could cost you a promotion.  Not all companies are like that but quite a few are to the point where it's worrying.  When your job is on the line and you have kids, a spouse, and other things on your mind like how you're going to pay for your children to go to college mental health takes the back burner.  What also takes a back burner is having a relationship with your children.  How many of these parents of mass shooters in America had no idea what their kids were up to?  How many of them didn't know that they were depressed or otherwise dealing with a mental illness?  The other question to ask is how many of them were in treatment and it wasn't enough?  You can't predict or stop every murder.  Most people are killed by someone they know rather than someone you don't know but fixing some of these issues is a good start.  According to the FBI, violent crime has actually decreased but you wouldn't know that from the media.  https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/violent-crime/violent-crime-topic-page/violentcrimemain_final

There's a whole system that needs to be fixed.  It's not just one particular issue.  There are many that are failing here and everyone wants to gripe and complain about it but it's always someone else's problem.  We have politicians that talk about changing things and never do.  We have voters that are frustrated but keep falling for the same lies and nothing really changes much. Welcome to the great ol' American dream.

null,null,KIZUKO,UnionFlag,London - Suzuki Bandit 600 Mk2,null,"In 2008 I was given a Honda Lead 110 scooter by my stepdad so I could get to work.

I had it 3 weeks and traded it in for a brand new Honda Varadero 125 which was then stolen 3 months later. It rode past me the night after it was stolen in rush hour traffic, not a mile from my house where it was stolen and I saw it again 2 weeks later after it had been recovered from a known (and wanted for other crimes) thief's garage and totally stripped of plastics and electrics and had the tail sawn off. Because his garage was open when the police found it, anyone could have put it there and he got off with it.

After that, I basically was screwed by the insurance company (a lesson in small print) and left to pay the finance for the remaining 2+ years at which point I couldn't afford another bike or to be able to commute to work so I ended up moving within walking distance to work (but no safe place to park a bike) and attempted my motorcycle test which I failed and couldn't afford to do it a second time so motorcycles went on the back burner.

Fastforward to 2011, I moved to London and could afford a bike but had nowhere to keep one so once again, no bike still.

2014 I bought my first house and it has a garage so 4 weeks after I moved in, I picked up a Yamaha XVS125 Dragstar and started commuting into London. I went on to do my test (and pass it) 6 months later.

I sold the XVS125 in March 2015 for exactly what I paid for it and picked up a Suzuki Bandit 600.

TL;DR 2008 Honda Lead 110 - Sold for deposit, 2008 Honda Varadero 125 - Stolen &amp; written off, 2008 - 2014 on a break, 2014 Yamaha XVS125 Dragstar - Sold once test passed, 2015 Suzuki GSF600 Bandit - Current commuter",null,0,null,1440634216,null,null,false,0,cugwist,null,t3_3ij7do,null,null,null,t3_3ij7do,null,null,null,1441518939,null,1,null,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null

It doesn't represent all of the community by any means. But it is always in the best interest of everybody to trust in scientific method and healthy scepticism before emotion and sensationalism. Even though it's more boring. 
 
As long as the most loud members of certain homogenous movements (conspiracy, feminism etc.) are ridiculous enough to be able to mock without much effort then the actual genuine thinkers within those movements lose credibility. And it's why on sites like reddit there was /r/atheism and then after a while people though it became retarded so they made /r/true atheism or whatever it's called. 
 
But the push towards objective truth is never a bad thing even if it seems to in an immediate sense just be agreeing with the status quo. There's a good reason why in science, it takes a log time for new theories to become mainstream. Because one study or one genius is usually not enough. It's a good thing to be slow and sensible.

&gt;Tell me again about how a criminal will follow the law and not buy a gun.  

Well, it's a lot more difficult to get a gun, it doesn't take much to work that one out.  

&gt;And when that gun welding nutter goes and shots up a school and kills your child  

Well he really shouldn't be welding guns in the first place, that could damage the gun.  

&gt;tell me again about how it‚Äôs sensible to stop law abiding citizens defending themselves.  

1) Citizens can still defend themselves, since guns aren't the only form of defence.  
2) Stopping law abiding citizens from getting guns also makes it harder for non-law abiding citizens to get guns.  
3) I assume you're an advocate for legalizing grenades, rocket launchers, and nuclear weaponry, because otherwise you're stopping law abiding citizens from defending themselves from threats armed with such weapons!  

&gt;Two men near me were stabbed ti death. That gun law REALLY stoped them dying didn‚Äôt it?  

1) Are you seriously expecting the law to stop anybody from dying?  
2) That number could have been a lot higher if the attacker had a gun, and the frequency could go up too.  
3) You say you want guns because it allows people to defend themselves. Knives are legal too, yet the victims didn't manage to defend themselves. What's up with that?  

&gt;you're blinkered if you think the law stops criminals.  

Banning guns decreases gun crime. It's not a case of ""either there is gun crime, or there isn't"". There can be a lot of gun crime, or a little gun crime, or no gun crime, or anywhere in between.  

&gt;All it does is control those who blindly follow  

...and makes it a lot harder to commit such crimes.  

&gt;who blindly follow, without question, what others tell then to do.  

Hey, here's a cool thing, some people *agree* with the law, and yet they're not blind! Amazing! I agree with the current gun laws, for my own independently formed reasons, I don't see how that makes me a sheep, it just means that I'm not trying to be a contrarian dicknob.  

&gt;Now‚Ä¶ Sit! Stay! There‚Äôs a good boy!

That's not a claim you can make without some sort of source.

&gt; He cut the phone lines to the school to prevent anyone calling for help, which is the kind of thing you would expect from an assassin, not a random guy.

Maybe he just put a lot of thought into his crime.

&gt; He then went in to the gym and killed only a specific group of children and their teachers, he had hundreds of rounds of ammunition and the opportunity but once he was finished with them he killed himself instead of trying to kill any other children.

There's a ton of reasons why he could have stopped killing. And as others have said, he did fire into other classrooms.

&gt; Why those children? Well maybe because they were abused by the political ring and they needed to be silenced, along with the teachers they had told.

Maybe. But this makes a huge number of assumptions with nothing concrete to back it up. Besides, the fact that victims from the 1970s are only now coming forward makes it clear that powerful people don't need to kill to guarantee their victims' silence.

&gt; Now you are probably thinking it's just a crazy theory and maybe it is, but why was the evidence such as the post mortems either burned or classified for 100 years?

Would Townsend have scored 15 goals and assisted 5 in that same Roma side? Was Townsend ever touted by many respected journalists, from his roots at River to Rome (inb4 Townsend never played there), and all over Europe, to be up there with the finest names you can conjure up in world football? Did Townsend excel in the most passionate, heated derby in world football, as a youngster against no other than Riquelme as his opposite as the 10 at Boca with Lamela the 10 at River. I doubt in a similar scenario he would. 

Would he be branded 'Totti's Heir' not only by Italians, but by Totti himself directly. And that was after his *first* debut decent season there. It's like someone saying Townsend is Robbens heir. We would just shake our heads, yet at that time, they were convinced he was. 

I dislike Townsend as he doesn't deliver, but I like him for being home grown and a local lad. 

I feel that it's not some conspiracy that journalists, armchair scouts, Roma scouts, fans, said that he can become a fantastic player and it's not JUST his fault he hasn't provided the goods. Even without him in the side every single Post Match thread is how toothless, aimless we looked, regardless who plays. 

If I had a choice between some ridiculous 14 million EURO deal, which is peanuts, for Lamela, or 10m from some mid/bottom Premier League club for Townsend, I would bite their hand of to get rid of Townsend. Lamela right now is a square peg trying to fit a round hole. But a very very good peg. Townsend is a backup peg that won't ever fit that hole.

null,null,Hazzman,null,null,null,"As a British-American who just moved to the United States last year after 20 years in the UK let me explain something to you that, even after I've explained it to you, you still won't get it. 

You are never going to see gun control in this country, or gun bans or anything remotely like what you have in other countries around the world. Its not because people are stubbornly hanging on to them, its not because people 'like' them, its not because of self defense. Guns are a right of every single person in this country, for better or worse. Gun ownership is woven into the very fabric of this nation, its' part of the DNA - It's gospel, law.. No amount of hoity British critique or bleating from overseas or dead children's faces plastered on prime time news is going to change that. The only thing that will ever change this is some sort of catastrophic civil war. 

You may not like this, you may hate it, you may consider America and Americans barbaric, you may believe it is a crime against humanity but it is never, ever, ever going to change. 

This is why people want to talk about Mental health services in this country. Not because they want to delude themselves and divert attention from guns but because if gun control is non-negotiable (and that's a fact, deal with it) then what can we do to help people who might commit atrocities with these weapons?

Let me tell you mental health services are woefully under developed here. It's a tragedy all it's own. Criminally under funded, misunderstood and frankly ignored. Guns are simply bringing this truth to the forefront. Another truth being thrust into the light isn't the culture of guns in this country, but the very real culture of violence. There is a culture of violence in this country which is extremely disturbing and dangerous. A country that will expend enormous effort to photoshop the word 'Pussy' off of the truck in KillBill, dub over any character using the word but then show in all of its gratuitous glory the truck owner having his head smashed to pieces in a giant metal door - has a fucking problem. A real problem. 

I can't swear at work, you won't see a pair of tits anywhere in a public setting here and the possibility would lead to hysteria - but you go right ahead and blow someone to pieces on television for children to see and that gets a thumbs up all round. 

I'm tired of British people commenting on this situation. It's a different country. It's culture , its laws and its history are very different and it is significantly larger and more difficult to solve this kind of problem than it was in the UK. It's a Gordian knot that will not be undone barring some terrible catastrophe like a civil war - and it doesn't help having British people making smarmy, snippy comments about stuff they simply cannot and will not ever understand.

1) Small and easy to hide

2) almost exclusively self loading, so capable of firing a lot fo shots rapidly in unskilled hands

3) Designed to be lethal to people, as opposed to say shot guns which are primarily for pests and vermin

4) Desirable to Criminals. If we have a legal supply and stock of them, it's far easier to hide illegal weapons within the existing legal ones. Right now, No-one has a 9mm Self loading pistol in the UK. If you see one, it's either police issue or unlawfully held. That makes enforcement of legislation way easier, and makes it way harder for criminals to get out of prison time for possessing firearms. As soon as you have legal stock of such weapons, you introduce grey areas. Criminals LOVE grey areas. It's room to manouver.

5) There is no 'legitimate' reason to need/use a handgun in the UK. We don't have dangerous game, you can't carry firearms for self defence. They have no purpose, as opposed to say a large bore rifle which can be used for deer, or a .22 which can be used for vermin and target shooting without any of the problems of points 1-4.

This isn't pragmatism, this is ignoring any lessons to be learned in Scotland.

Give someone a choice between a Tory, and someone who looks like a Tory, and they'll vote Tory every time.

&gt; 'Red' Ed Miliband

Can we stop using the right-wing media's nickname for Ed? It didn't even work, people didn't reject Ed or Labour because we were too left wing, they rejected Ed because he was weird and they didn't see him as a PM(People were laughing at the notion in the HIGNFY audience a week before the election). People rejected Labour because they didn't trust us on either the economy or the promise not to form a coalition with the SNP.

Let me get this right, pre-97 people voted Labour because they wanted stricter immigration and welfare cuts? People stopped voting Labour in droves because of the Iraq war, my own constituency was a Lib Dem seat for 10 years because of that. The skivers/strivers narrative has been around for donkeys years, just by other names. 

A lot of people did vote for Charles Kennedy's Lib Dems, they achieved their best ever result in 2005(since the merger). 

In 1997 Tony Blair promised a fair few left wing polices he didn't deliver on, renationalisation of the railways, an end to NHS internal markets(which he actually accelerated once in power) and putting workers in boardrooms. He didn't deliver, unions are being smashed right now, the rail system is a mess and don't get me started on the NHS. Left/Right doesn't come into the average voters mind. 

""Suspicion on the EU"" is not a right-wing attitude, a lot of what's now considered the hard left is eurosceptic. Cruddas' questions were so stupidly leading they destroyed any hope of drawing any conclusions from them.

[Here's a counter argument to that poll](http://labourlist.org/2015/08/jon-cruddas-is-wrong-his-inquiry-poll-actually-proves-labour-need-a-clearer-anti-austerity-agenda/). His findings are really the opposite of comprehensive, whoever he hired to conduct the polling is stealing a living.

Corbyn voting against the welfare bill was what caused his surge in popularity. If Burnham had actually grown a pair of bollocks and not been such a pandering knobhead he might have been in with a shot at this.

Your 'key loss groups' are based on a short flawed study by Cruddas? Or the Fabians study, which was more about how hard it is going to be to win whoever is elected? Seriously mate, your jumping to some pretty big conclusions based on flawed ""Evidence.""

You assume many Lib Dems will go back, but you seem to be oblivious to the fact in 2010 they were *the* student party to vote for. In 2015 it was Labour/Green. The Lib Dems will not be recovering in a hurry, they've lost all their left-leaning voters and have elected a man who abstained on key liberal issues to be their leader. 

""Sufficiently flexible"" is something you'd only hear from someone who likes MPs saying literally anything to win. It's exactly what people are sick of and it's exactly why Corbyn's winning. We don't want to be flexible, have a set of principles and adapt them to fit in with society. Do not suddenly start attacking those on benefits or immigrants because that's what the Tories and the media do. 

Corbyn does use soundbites, they're just not meaningless waffle. Tell me how many voters would give 2 fucks that Andy Burnham says he's not part of the 'westminster bubble?' Or that Cooper really wants to 'invest in hi-tech science' but lets not expand on that.

The Tories didn't get elected because they kept repeating 'Long term economic plan.' This is revisionism at it's worst. That is the most ludicrous thing I've ever read in relation to their victory.

Kinnock didn't refer to Wilson as left-wing because as you say he wasn't particularly left-wing in government, it's what people do at the end of their political careers that defines them. Look at Kinnock, would anyone call him left-wing now? Or at least to the extent he was when he started? 

You can throw all the historical evidence you want at Corbyn's potential leadership, but there's no precedent for it, the PLP is very different from even 5 years ago, nevermind when Foot was leader. I think the deputy and the whip will be more important figures in terms of party unity. 

I like that you've taken the time to write that, but I disagree with the point that you've built the entire piece on, you say at the start you've been accused of parroting what the mainstream media says and honestly you have. 

You know in the whole article you've got no quotes from Corbyn and haven't mentioned any of his polices barring a brief mention of People's QE. This is a much kinder wording of the same argument that's been spat out a million different ways by the press, but you've built yours off some relatively flawed arguments.

 I've heard some of the counter arguments you've put in, but they seem like ones you could easily answer, even calling one of your own hypothetical counter-arguments 'daft.' You're the one suggesting it as an argument!

There is something to be said for the daft argument that you so quickly dismiss though, not electability, but the Blairites need for 'modernisation' which seems not to be a code-word for Tory concessions, such as keeping private sector involvement in the NHS. They seem to be up for making sacrifices for the sake of making them, and Blair now says if he could win on a left-wing platform he wouldn't. Which sort of goes against his 'winning machine' persona his admirers have given him.

You can't apply the politics of the 90s to today. Social democrat parties are being roundly rejected across Europe right now, the answer is not shifting further to the right like you seem to be advocating. 

People like Corbyn because he stands for something, right now we've seen 2 things, the reaction of Labour members/supporters to him and the media and political establishment. That's it, the guesswork involved in seeing the electorates reaction is just that, guesswork. 

The fact is he's the only one in the leadership race that's put forward *any* coherent reason why Labour lost and what his vision is of the Labour party and Britain going forward, put like that it doesn't sound like much, and honestly it isn't. The other 3 candidates have been so dull they've turned what was the 'standard bearer of the left' into a rockstar socialist.",null,0,null,1440637802,null,null,false,0,cugyj49,null,t3_3ih2gu,null,null,null,t1_cugf4ny,null,null,null,1441519886,null,2,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

You can blame gun laws all you want, from a US perspective, but the bigger issue I think is social inequality. Massive socio-economic divides as well as rising race tensions are all deep rooted problems in the US.

If the US changed to UK gun laws overnight somehow, I think that it would work for about a week before crime returned to normal rates.

In similar ways, the UK has its own socio-economic issues, manifested in its own ways. The actions of ISIS as well as the government's hardline approach to it are evidence that the UK, like the US, has similar problems but in a different way.

You misunderstood, perhaps on purpose.

Criminals WANT handguns. They seek them out. We (the police, I am one) take them off them. THey don't stash shotguns (full length ones anyway) or rifles or match rifles. They want HANDGUNS. Thankfully, they are exceptionally rare and usually in very poor condition, reducing their effectiveness. They're hard to find becuase there is no legitimate supply or stock in the UK.

Similarly, because there's no legitimate source of them or machine pistols, ammunition is very hard to come by. So rounds fired on 'the street' tend to be the wrong caliber for the weapon, or home made loads with ball bearings not bullets, plus inneffective propellant...

/u/WindyCOYS comments about AVB solving the late mistakes problem is spot on. He moved the set piece and other defensive work to the end of the session, so that the players had to drill defensively whilst drained (mentally and physically).

Personally I think our issue is in a slow transition, we are laborious and congested when moving through the middle third. This is perhaps a symptom of all the proposed issues in the article. Lack of pace, width, playing a defender in midfield and the harsh truth that we aren't that much better than a lot of premier league teams. Leceister are in amazing form and were away and United away is always an insane ask. Perhaps 4-5 points is a more realistic roof of what we could have expected.

I fully disagree with Tom Hayward, Kane is phenomenal and not worth discussing as an issue right now. His using of the past tense with mistake is a bit rich granted the window isn't over and his slating of Levy suggests an agenda.

I love us rascally humans. But unfortunately, reason, foresight, and impulse-inhibition are not ubiquitous enough in a large enough portion of our population to reasonably justify murder-toy hobbyism.

It's also a big no-no in the U.S. to express any sentiment about guns that falls short of 100% condoning everyone owning them, loving them, having sex with them, and [giving fully automatic versions of them to 9 year-olds](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-of-instructor-killed-by-9-year-old-with-uzi-send-video-message-to-girl/).

And, as much as I've enjoyed shooting guns, I've also realized that the only piece of mind is freedom *from* guns. Mostly because the overwhelming majority of people I've met that ""support the freedom to own guns"" are usually just people wishing for an opportunity to ""legitimately"" use them.

null,null,ihatesleep,null,null,null,"Honest assessment of his talent, benefits and downside:

Son Heung Min is a **very** talented player and I know every supporter around here is ambivalent around these ""talented but inconsistent"" players but I can see Son with flashes of brilliance instead of Lamela who really will be remembered for his rabona goal

*He is a very fluid player for Leverkusen and played both wings for them and Hamburg. However, I honestly believe his best position is as a second striker or as a winger with freedom to drift into the middle of the field with someone to occupy the space left on the wing. The majority of his national team goals have been from the center of the pitch and usually counter attacks. Here are a couple examples of his goals so you can see his style:

-[Top 5 Son Bundesliga goals from 14/15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e26-ldLcvKQ)
-[Goal vs Algeria WC 2014](http://gfycat.com/MatureSatisfiedCormorant)
-[Goal vs Australia Asia Cup Final](http://gfycat.com/SneakyEsteemedIvorybilledwoodpecker)
-Also I recommend you watch his hat trick performance vs Dortmund. I wasn't able to find a link but he absolutely demolished Dortmund when he was on Hamburg and was Dortmund's kryptonite consistently.

*His finishing is brilliant with both feet and is known for his composed finishing off counters and great shot placement to curl it around the keeper when he drifts in centrally.  If he can play off the shoulder of Kane, that will not only benefit Son but also relieve pressure off Kane.

*His downsides are pretty important. He can really disappear from his club games if he's not put into a position to touch the ball and score goals. This is why to me his form for the national team is much more consistent than for Leverkusen. Obviously he needs to be able to perform with other players, but if he's not given the free space behind the strikers he won't be knocking in goals as often as you'd like.

However, his control of the South Korean market is something that the club will hold valuable if he signs. He's definitely the star of the current national team (alongside Ki Sung Yueng from Swansea) considering the old guard have all ceased to play (ex. Park, Cha Du Ri, etc).

2: The Mind Robber- Brilliant, first episode is creepy and is one of the best, and the rest is closest Doctor Who has gotten to as a children's show.

Tomb of the Cybermen: Thrilling with some action as the Doctor revives some Cybermen.

3: Inferno- One of the most classic of Classic Doctor Who. The 3rd Doctor winds up in an alternate universe and must deal with a tough Brigadier there.

The Three Doctors- It's the anniversary episode

Carnival of Monsters- It's incredibly fun with interesting ideas.

4: The Brain of Morbius- This well-known episode pitches the Doctor against another Time Lord.

The Key to Time- This is Season 16 with ""The Ribos Operation, the Pirate Planet, The Stones of Blood, The Androids of Tara, The Power of Kroll, the Armageddon Factor."" This is very iconic since it takes an entire season and most of the stories are pretty good. Stones of Blood is worst, Armageddon Factor best.

5: Castrovalva- This is the 5th Doctor's first episode and it's very interesting with his trauma and the idea of recursion in the story after all of the chaos theory from Logopolis.

Kinda/Snakedance- Two stories in ""Mara Tales"" which give the same atmosphere as Indian culture and are overall good.

Enlightenment- This is a race through space that the Doctor gets stuck in and there are a number of twists.

6: The Trial of a TimeLord- (The Mysterious Planet, Mindwarp, Terror of the Vervoids, The Ultimate Foe) I know, I know how these stories aren't exactly the best, but they're all pretty interesting with the Sixth Doctor. Definitely have the fun and interest factor.

7: The Happiness Patrol/ The Greatest Show in the Galaxy- Both of these are here for the fun factor.

Obviously, this is just Louisiana state law, but we are portrayed as ignorant gun-toting rednecks 9/10... so I feel our laws serve as a good example to put ridiculous claims like yours to rest.  

On a personal note:  I was trained to shoot starting at age seven.  My father was a GM in the Navy and weapons were a part of his daily life.  I realize this is simply a personal anecdote, but my brother and I NEVER touched a gun without his express permission and supervision.  

I've never owned a gun myself, nor have I the desire to at this time.  I support stricter gun control and limitations, but full disarmament is completely antithetical to the American culture.  I'm from New Orleans, but my parents now live outside the city in the countryside.  Having a gun is literally your only protection from violent encounters as the police response time is 30 min at best.  

We also have alligators, coyotes, wildcats, and the occasional bear or rare panther.  The snakes we usually behead with a machete.

Finally, having lived through Hurricane Katrina and the months long aftermath... Guns? Your only protection.  Period.  And not just from looters taking advantage of a bad situation.  Look up the Danziger Bridge incident if you want proof.

Even the way he handled Bale - phenomenon though he was - in terms of loosening up his formation and tactics to give him a free role, was impressive and paid massive dividends.

I haven't seen a similar level of flexibility with Poch so far.  All the issues that plagued the side in the first month of last season are still there one year on.  The fact that pretty much every responder has highlighted obvious, gaping holes in our squad this late in the window (meaning that potential sellers like West Brom can use our obvious desperation against us) is quite galling - everyone could see these issues last season, so why are they still here now?

I want to see some earnest self-reflection from Poch, and an openness to changing his methods.  As much as people on here seem to laud his ""system"", it's a) not in evidence on the pitch and b) not really working for us even if it is.

I disagree on your last point with the central midfielder though.  I think both Capoue and Stambouli were suited fine to our side, as long as our manager was willing to play to their strengths rather than exile them due to perceived incompatibility.  I just don't see how a side with Mason or Dier at CDM in it is any better than one with those two.

null,null,lak47,lfc87,,null,"Agreed. It's extremely difficult for such DMs to come by. Mascherano was one of them. Vidal is another one. 

It comes down to now taking stock of what we got. We've got a player in Can who's, like you said, a good athlete and has lots of power specially for his age but lacks the defensive prowess and knack of reading the game at this moment, obviously that will come only with age. 

Then we've got Lucas who's got decent tackling skills, can read play, can break up attacks and pass well over short distances. He lacks athleticism and sits in front of the defense. But that's what he's excellent at, and that's what you want against big teams. He's there to 'screen' the back 4. 

It'd make full sense to use the strenghts of both players and, somehow, intergate it into one midfield. 

The equation is complex because one place is Milners, one is Jordans. The third is up for grabs. And it should be determined by the opposition we play against. Can for 'banana skin' teams. Luca for the bigger games.

As for where to get such a bike for the tests, most people hire them from motorcycle training schools, usually as part of a training/test package. I don't believe the test centres have *any* bikes, aside from those used by the examiners which may well be their own machines.

You can theoretically use your own bike, but you bring up the main problems with that option. It is possible, IIRC one of the guys on here did it.

**If the story is noteworthy enough to be written, it should be written ethically and neutrally regardless of the story or context**

This internal email from the technology editor - Jemima Kiss - was accidentally leaked, telling writers to back off and wait for **Leigh Alexander** to brief them:

http://theralphretort.com/wp-content/uploads/GUARDIANEMAIL1.png

**Leigh Alexander is cited as having 18 violations of ethical integrity.** She has a good reason to not allow the real story to be told. She was covering her own back and changing how a two sided story was reported.

http://deepfreeze.it/journo.php?j=leigh_alexander

She also spearheaded a campaign whereby 18-19 competing websites wrote identical articles, between 28th August - 1st September, denouncing gamers as ""dead"" in order to silence and negate criticism of her website and her friends. The first 5 articles were released within around one hour of each other.

Agreed. Would like to see Can in the West Ham game too. If Henderson is back, he picks himself. Lucas as a sub if push comes to shove. 

&gt; Did you find any faults with how Rodgers set us up?

No. He got it spot on. Before the game I posted somewhere that shut up shop and go for a point. Batter them 0-0 :p It was a good game we grew into, somewhere along the way I thought we could win it. I have a gripe about Lovren above Sakho, but it's working...somehow, and I still feel the better defender is warming the bench. I'm a bit concerned about Benteke too. He NEEDS to score. Play and hold up is good, but ultimately, he's there to score goals and this not only for the team but for his confidence which directly translates to more goals for us. 

All that said though, a draw is a great result for us.

Every regeneration reshuffles the Doctors appearance and personality but only to a superficial level (I.e. every incarnation has had the same core traits of being heroic, curious, caring, intelligent, general dislike for weapons and violence and love of life and exploration). So he's the same Doctor with different surface personas that express his core traits in different ways.

Ten explained his fear of death despite knowing he would regenerate by describing it as becoming a different person, and that he as he saw himself would die and someone else would take his place. That shows that 10 was VERY attached to his current personality and form. Which makes sense when you think about what he'd been through and his perspective (Especially knowing how much he hated his war doctor form, and he thinks of 9 as still recovering from War).

Now look at it from the perspective of 11, looking back across all his lives now that he feels it's all coming to an end. From 11's perspective, he went through the change that 10 was so afraid of and everything turned out alright. It's like an old man looking back at a photo of him as a teenager and commenting to a friend that he couldn't stand the thought of cutting his hair or changing his clothing style.

The BBC is now terrible, resting on a reputation it once deserved but has long squandered by its own hubris.

I just checked my DVR and have only two ""series"" recordings on it - Only Connect and Bake Off. And I'm getting bored of Only Connect,  I often give up watching when the last ""missing letters"" starts. Also they shouldn't have family members teammates, that makes it like Ask The Family.

But I digress. I watch an hour or two on TV a day, mainly netflix / box set US imports. Dr Who and Sherlock are the only shows the BBC produces that are even in that class of quality, and the number of hours of these shows per year is ridiculous.

I find the non entertainment shows similarly weak, a few hours per year of quality, the ones that are usually mentioned in all the apologies. 

And the news is awful too (I'm in Scotland, nuff said).

So, no, I don't want diktat, but I do want better TV and the existence of the BBC isn't helping. Removing the BBC as part of a change in media control - also splitting the Sky monopoly between programming and distribution, limiting the exclusivity of pay channels for shows. etc would be a good thing.

- Beware of the spray! This can be really nasty and can only be avoided by having a pretty hefty following distance and even then, on roads that have a lot of standing water it's hard to avoid. Spray makes you wet - and makes your visor very foggy. 

- Road positioning - lots of people tend to ride up the middle of the road between tyre tracks; this is because as warm vehicle engines pass over that area they dry it out. Makes sense then to ride there when it's pouring down, right? Well, not exactly - debris collects here like a beaut. It's a sure way to pick up flint and punctures that will just wreck your tyres.

* The top left of the screen is wholly unnecessary. *Scan &amp; Bag* adds nothing, neither does their gawdy banner-image; in-fact it just confuses the layout - a picture of fruit and vegetables will surely activate a sort of fruit weighing feature? No, it's just a banner-ad. Weighing is done by the *other* photo of fruit and veg. Get it right, pleb.

* The weight scale in the bottom left is too divorced from its function to weight fruit and veg. It's just sitting there spending 99.9999% of its life displaying 00.00Kg

* There are way too many little snippets over the machine that lose the focus of the user. NCR is stamped twice over the machine, Chip &amp; Pin manufacturer and model number is irrelevant, please collect your receipt/please insert your coins is just cluttered. There's no intuitive flow for the eye to follow; text jumps in font, colour and background. Key in code is only ever used by staff (and look up item is *never* used), so why are they grouped together in the same colour as Finish &amp; Pay, which is *always* used by the user? Why are some buttons like Help in a green rounded button placed next to a button that manipulates the shopping list like Cancel Item?

* The icon design is confused. Are they going for the almost skeuomorphic 3D design seen on 'look up item' and 'key in code', real-life images like weighing fruit and veg, or 2D pictograms like the mobile phone top up, volume control and Finish &amp; Pay.

* Why are the items in 1970's database abbreviations? It has no place in A.D 2015 to show a user a truncated data form. You could *easily* show the full product name, and maybe even include branding. There's no reason to import the traditions of heat-activated paper receipts onto the screen.

* Why are there universally unused UI elements like toggle up/down, when the entire screen is a touchscreen. Is the volume button a slider like *every single* mobile phone these days, or is it just a button that takes you to a shitty screen to enter a 0-100 numerical value using a shitty 0-9 digit keypad?

Sadly, there is no practical solution for America. They can't do an amnesty as it wouldn't work. You can't ban guns outright because then you would make criminals out of a lot of the population (and America can't handle more prisoners). You can't restrict the sale of guns to certain people because it is discriminatory. 


Essentially, America is fucked regarding its gun crimes and laws (or lack of them.) It's just for us to sit here and appreciate, despite how ""cunty"" and evil our government are, at least we don't have a society built on an obsession with guns and that our government are living in fear from gun firms.

Fair point, but perhaps because I poorly worded my argument. 

What I meant to say is that it is the unbalanced market that is the issue, killing the BBC will not in itself fix this, even radically changing the nature of the organisation on its own isn't enough and needs to be part of a wider change.

I do understand that my requirements may not be universal, viz: more TV and radio I like, less I don't like - and I also understand that I am arguing for the same result as people with very different motives (ideologues in the Conservative party / friends of Murdoch) who would not want the other changes I think are needed.

Basically though the BBC needs to get its shit together and make the changes being pushed on it part of a wider examination on the failing British TV industry.

But there was absolutely nothing about chemtrails, 9/11, Boston Bombing false flags, FEMA camps, HAARP etc - all stuff someone in his position would have known about if they were true (considering the huge number of people needed to carry them off, and the fact everyone down to local emergency services and journalists are in on them, if you belive conspiracy theorists who claim people 'slip up' and reveal the truth -  see the BBC journalist saying tower 7 had fallen, or the claim firemen were heard saying to pull the tower). In fact the spying revelations themselves completely contradict the favourite conspiracy theory, that of the NWO one world government that controls all western nations. If that was true, why is the US tapping Angela Merkel's phone? Why is the NWO spying on itself?

I can't (and I don't think anyone can) tell you an estimate of how much it'll cost you but if it helps I can break down my cost for you. This is what I did - bare in mind that I have a full driving license and have a few years experience on the road which makes a massive difference to the learning curve:

1) CBT = 1 full day - c.¬£125

2) 125cc tuition = 1 full day - c.¬£150

3) 9 months commuting on the 125cc

4) 2 hours training on 650cc (tried a new school and didn't like them) = ¬£50

5) DAS = 3 full days - ¬£530

6) Theory Test = ¬£25

7) Mod 1 Test = ¬£150

8) Mod 2 Test = ¬£170

TOTAL = ¬£1200

TOTAL HOURS TUITION = 37

Now bare in mind a few things. Firstly, you pay your money you take your choice. Relatively pricey tuition but it was incredibly good and I passed both tests with a combined total of 1 minor and passed first time on each. If you re-sit it's all that money again for a re-test so you have to speculate to accumulate a little.

Also, I didn't NEED all that tuition but I took it because it made me a safer/better rider and helped me to ensure I'd pass the tests. I think I could have dropped 1 of the full DAS days and the 125cc day and saved a total of ¬£350.

Looking at the photo in OP it would suggest to me that they're being used to stop pedestrians venturing into what is clearly a construction zone, exposed rails above the ground (as someone else has pointed out) and also sensitive track-side equipment which may get inadvertently damaged if the public were allowed to venture into that area where the tracks are exposed.

I have to say I completely disagree with your post, too. I'm not really into this post-human vision of the world, where lines on maps are an inconvenience to us all living wherever we feel like. There seems to be this perception that we can just build more infrastructure and housing and open the gates to whoever wants to live here. As if we should throw up tower flats or new builds as far as the eye can see and turn Britain into one giant city.

Why should we do that? What right do they have to come live here? We can get all 'teenage nihilist' and talk about how it's 'unfair' that I have the right and someone else doesn't, but that doesn't wash with me. It is the way it is. There's no, 'what if the roles were reversed,' because I, as the combination of my parents' genetics, could only have ever existed in the universe where I am now, and the same applies for the migrant. And that's a bit shit but to be blunt I don't care. That's the way it goes. I don't see people solving all of my problems for me. I have been born into a system of statutory and conventional rules and regulations, and have to make my decisions in light of those systems to get a decent life. I don't see people bestowing me with a better paying job or a big fat house because I tried to tunnel my way into a bank vault every night for three months.

When I lived in London I used to think it was fine. We could just build more. And I thought that because I saw building going on, and I saw awesome infrastructure. More people? Just put on more buses. Just expand further out to the M25.

Then I moved out to the countryside and started catching the train into London. The town where I live has been there for over 1,000 years. It has one road running through it across the river. It has a population of less than 35,000, and that road is gridlocked every rush hour and every weekend as people try to get through it to buy their groceries. And the government want to stick two developments on the side of the town, bringing the population up to near 40,000. That's how you break a town. There's no infrastructure to support that kind of development, and unless you start tearing down listed buildings and a rather stunning old church, you can't widen that road.  You can't expand the train station car park either without converting the park, but the eventual destiny of that piece of land is already understood by locals to be a foregone conclusion. There is simply no space in the majority of British towns for serious, credible, and sustainable expansion.

There's this idea that fills the minds of idiots that we can just build more. Build more everything. Everywhere. Space is an infinite resource. 'We've only built on 2% of the land!' Don't worry about air quality affecting the crops. Don't worry about the fact that when you add up the protected park lands and mountain ranges, and factor in the inhospitableness of some parts of the country, that we actually have a rather limited amount of arable land. Don't worry about the fact that we already ship in half of our food, and Just In Time Procurement has completely screwed us should those shipping lanes ever be affected by *force majeure* or - dare I say it - a war in a part of the world, we'd be buggered in less than a week.

People seem to think that talking about immigration and population is racist. Apparently, 300,000 net immigration is sustainable. Over a 10 year period, that's 3 million. Manchester has 2,700,000 people in it, according to the internet. So, where, over a 10 year period, do you put another Manchester? Physically? Let's say you chop it up into chunks. An acre here, an acre there. Birmingham's big. Let's stick 1,000 acres in Birmingham, dotted around the outskirts in little developments so no one notices.

I mean seriously. Where do uber-liberals suggest we build another Manchester? How do you pay for it? Because a Manchester filled with largely unskilled immigrants sure as hell isn't going to have the same productivity as highly skilled Manchester.

It's unreal to me that people seem to think that I'm supposed to feel guilt and shame from Facebook posts of a guy crying in a dinghy. Yeah, you've got it shit mate. That blows. That really, really blows. I hope things improve for you. But we don't have the same rights, and I don't see why we should. There are human rights, but there's no human right to live where you want. I don't have the right to go live in America, 'just like that'. You don't have the right to come live here.

But no. No. It's all fine. Those people should be council flats and the dole. Because other people will pay for it, and see no return on their money. Tax is apparently charity when you don't pay a lot of it, not a mutually agreed investment in a common wealth. And there are no real ecological problems which arise from a high population density. That's just uneducated scaremongering. We'll just tax everyone else, and pay for absolutely killer social services, and it'll all be ok.

As for the housing I told you my own personal experience and you have dismissed it.

We didn't intervene in Syria, where most of these people are from. We shied away from getting involved with Assad and ISIS, back when people didn't know what ISIS was really capable of. We decided that Assad was a bad man (and I think he is), and that we should stay out of it. A close friend of mine and ardent progressive's words were, IIRC, 'I think they should get out of there and try and make a better life.' And here we are!

Now we have Syrians knocking on the gates of every European country, and treasures of human civilisation have been eradicated from the historic record, all while citizens of Western nations are throwing world class education away and signing up to be rape puppets. Chalk up a win for staying out of foreign affairs.

&gt;instead promote internal development with foreign aid

Development - which I am well versed in - is plagued first and foremost by academics failing to agree on things. The other factor is that the governments of these nations are largely corrupt, and every time they're sent money it stops with the government. Financial aid doesn't work, and you'd be better off sponsoring an individual clinic.

&gt;Female literacy and poverty are both large factors in reducing family sizes so ... you should be an international socialist

Not sure what the connection is between socialism and progress. Oh wait. Something about loading the dice of political discussion with the term 'progressive' is coming to me.

&gt; Hilary Wainwright (born 1949) is a British sociologist, political activist and socialist feminist, best known for being editor of Red Pepper magazine. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Wainwright))

&gt; Hilary Wainwright is co-editor of Red Pepper and research director of the New Politics Project of the Transnational Institute, Amsterdam. ([Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/profile/hilarywainwright))

&gt; Hilary Wainwright is a leading researcher and writer on the emergence of new forms of democratic accountability within parties, movements and the state. She is the driving force and editor behind Red Pepper, a popular British new left magazine, and has documented countless examples of resurgent democratic movements from Brazil to Britain and the lessons they provide for progressive politics. ([Transnational Institute](https://www.tni.org/en/bio/hilary-wainwright))

I think this is the modular NCR checkout model. This means that NCR will have stamped them on each part. Morrisons can do nothing about this.

&gt;Why are the items in 1970's database abbreviations?

Hooo-boy.

At my employer we added a leading zero to our stock holding IDs, just a zero at the start of the ID number. Absolute nightmare. Yes it SHOULD be better, but to be honest it is not an easy job.

Because the screen is a single-touch screen and your phone is a multi-touch screen. Single touch screens are notoriously bad at tracking a ""drag"", hence the ""tap"" instead.

You've hit it right on the head there; that's the difference here.

The complaint is about a 'Nationalist dominated sub', and that complaint won't come from the raw number of subscribers of the sub, it will come from their activity, both in the submission of content and also their upvoting and downvoting habits (which is were the initial complaint came from here). 

So you wouldn't be able to get the results people care about, just by counting the number of submissions. You'd need to look at their respective karma, and then you'd probably need to do the same for comments as well, assigning a 'category' (nationalist, unionist, neutral, also even assign degrees of 'severity'?) and then examining the karma of these comments.

Also I would suggest that there would be a lot more factors at play here in how responders would choose to vote that wouldn't be present in /r/tall.

null,null,captf,Scotland,XJ6 Manchester,null,"My history is long-ish, which is odd, since I've only had my licence about a year.

Rewind to the early 80s. I was 3 or 4, and had my bicycle [no training wheels, because I was hardcore!] and CHiPs was on TV.  
I loved the shit out of that show, and used to tear around the local streets on my bike thinking I was one of them. I'd fall off my bike a lot, but dust myself off [bleeding from the road rash] and continue on.

Next, came Street Hawk. Rinse, repeat.

Zip forward almost 20 years, and I was living in Bournemouth, and finally had major disposable income.  
And for some stupid reason, I decided that learning to play the drums [something else I'd wanted to do for years] was more important than getting a bike licence...  
Idiot.  

Moved back to Scotland and for the next 8 years, I stopped having the money for a bike. But the urge wasn't massively there.  
It was a discussion with a friend about car and bike licences that made me go ""wait a sec, I have the money these days. As long as I don't have a car."" [But I did have a car...]  
So, I made the decision: if my car fails its MOT, I was getting a bike and selling the bastarding thing. This thing being a piece of shit rover that regularly cost me ¬£100s in repairs.  
It failed. I got my CBT.  
But, fate is a bitch. The car sucked up even more money than expected, and my household bills [living alone] became very hard to manage.  
I just couldn't afford lessons or a bike of my own [and I'd not have felt safe on it]

It was almost a year later than circumstances finally allowed me to restart lessons - I stopped living alone, where I was spending half of my wage on bills, to moving in with friends where accom+bills was ¬£200 a month. Ka-CHING!  
Lessons were going well, and then I was offered a job in Manchester. Half way through my DAS lessons, with no time to book in tests.

Money stabilised after my move within a couple of months, and I just went for a proper DAS course. Failed the first attempt at Mod 1 [I managed to not slalom, raged with myself and called it quits on the test], but passed the second 3 weeks later.  
But by that time, I was hooked and getting stupidly antsy to be on a bike, so bought a YBR125.  
Passed my Mod 2 on the 2nd of October, 4 weeks after buying the YBR.

That was OK, I planned to 'cut me teeth' on the YBR for an extended period of time. A year, I said.

In February, I bought an XJ6.  
I had been trying since November, but finance on the YBR hindered that.

No breaks from riding since. Winter didn't phase me - but it was only cold and wet. Little ice in a major city centre.",null,0,null,1440665052,null,null,false,0,cuh9m78,null,t3_3ij7do,null,null,null,t3_3ij7do,null,null,null,1441525240,null,4,null,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,4,null

A company issues shares to raise money to invest. People (or organisations) buy these shares and are entitled to share in the profit the company makes. Shares go up and down based on the (perceived) future profits and the (perceived) risk of the company going bust. The share of the profit (dividends) is what theoretically gives a share value.

Now if I get 5% dividends a year and the risk is low, then that's already a good deal as it's more than the bank gives on my money. If the shares go up, even better as I can sell them (and depending on where you live this part isn't taxed).

Some of the people buying shares now believe they will stop going down and will start going up again. If I had bought shares on the Dutch stock market yesterday I would have made on average 2.5% in one day. Which is a lot. But I didn't know shares were going to go up today, I just saw it on the news and by then it's already too late.

There are also financial products where you can make money when shares go down. I wouldn't trade in shares unless you sort of know what you are doing. It is not a way to get rich quick, it's a way to lose a lot of money in a short time if things don't go your way.

If you have a lot of savings it might be worth it but also as a way to spread risk. You don't put all your savings in stocks, or all in gold because then you are very vulnerable if the value goes up or down. Imagine putting everything you have in shares in early 2008, a year later you'd have lost half of what you had.",null,0,null,1440665447,null,null,false,0,cuh9pkx,null,t3_3ihxpu,null,null,null,t1_cuh9erd,null,null,null,1441525285,null,3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

So I found the Ion Air Pro WiFi. At first I was sceptical, because it was cheap, at ¬£120, that's quite cheap, compared to the GoPro and Drift cameras, that are in excess of ~¬£300, but honestly, I don't think I could have made a better choice. I get around 3^1/2 hours battery life from a full charge, it records 720p60fps, or 1080p30fps. The only downside is, in 1080p, it downscales the field of vision from 170¬∞ to around 150¬∞.

It's waterproof by design [no need for an extra casing], so is great in UK weather.

The screw hole for the mounting is an industry standard too [same one that is used on camera tripods], which is also used on the GoPro. So, if there's a mount that's labelled GoPro that doesn't use the housing, it will likely work for the Drift too.

null,null,FriendlyFamilyLawyer,null,null,null,"None of the below is legal advice, but (see username) I commonly deal with these sorts of cases. 

(1) The house. 

I presume from what you have said that you are registered as joint legal owners. This means you own the equity 50/50 unless you have a trust agreement to the contrary. It sounds like the only affordable option would be to sell it. Your partner will not be able to meet the mortgage and it appears unlikely that you will. It's unfortunate, but as is often the case the lifestyle that two incomes provide is much nicer than what those two individuals can afford separately.

The house would be covered as your Primary Private Residence for 18 months after you move out. This means there would be no Capital Gains Tax to pay on the sale. If you are out of the house for more than 18 months before sale, then CGT would kick in on the gain on your share. This is likely to be minimal, and probably won't get over the threshold.

The mortgage aspect really depends on the terms of your mortgage and how friendly your lender is to you. 

(2) Debts

AS you are not married, these are the responsibility of whoever's name they are in. You may want to agree something different from that, but it is up to you. If selling the house, it may be advisable to pay these off too.

(3) Child Maintenance

You can work out what you are required to pay [here](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-your-child-maintenance/y/pay). It is better if you do this by private agreement, as then none of the money would be eaten up by charges. As you will have already paid tax on it, she wouldn't have to. 

(3) Benefits

I tend not to deal much with benefits, but child tax credit and working tax credit come to mind. She might also be entitled to some other means tested benefits. There are a whole bunch of calculators on DWP/HMRC websites which help with this, alternatively Citizens Advice can do a benefit calculation if she goes to see them.

I've made my case. From my perspective as a Police officer in a major city, I'm quite happy with the law as it stands. I know the lengths criminals have to go to to obtain access to a firearm, I know how frequently we recover them (Very rarely) and the condition they're in (very poor). I go to a decent number of shootings and firearms incidents where a shotgun or poorly converted firearm (like a brockock) or a relic has been used where any better firearm would clearly have been used had it been available. It's not, so we have criminals saddled with less effective means to try and do harm.

Reducing the pool of available firearms reduced those that come into criminal possession. That's the way it is. I'm happy with that. Sorry you're not, but it appears the majority of the UK are.

This was actually campaigned for. Contracts actually used to be pretty opaque and consumers wouldn't know exactly how much they were actually paying for either the phone or the usage. What used to happen was this:

Consumer would take out a phone contract (with phone) for ¬£40p/m over 24 months. After 24 months, with the fixed period expired, the provider would continue to charge ¬£40p/m. Technically the consumer had two choices at this point: either upgrade their phone (and continue paying the higher price) or keep the current phone and pay a lower fee for usage.

The first option, presumably a major money maker for the phone providers, was preferred and they would often offer 'free' phone upgrades near to the end of the contract. Of course the upgrade wasn't free because they were already paying for it - the cost was just not as transparent.

Over time the phone providers actions changed. Instead of offering upgrades they didn't offer anything at all. Consumers who had gone 2 years paying ¬£40p/m for their phone and thought it was normal would continue to pay ¬£40p/m without realising they were overpaying (since they didn't always even get a new phone any more). A lot of consumers didn't even realised they *could* downgrade their usage plans to make their mobile cheaper.

This might seem pretty silly now but 10 years ago, when wide-spread phone usage was relatively new, this was rather common.

Complaints About the Judiciary:

Evidence of previous police interaction with Hamilton was presented to the Cullen Inquiry but later sealed under a closure order to prevent publication for 100 years.[16] 
Following a review of the closure order by the Lord Advocate, Colin Boyd, edited versions of some of the documents were released to the public in October 2005. Four files containing post mortem, medical records and profiles on the victims remained sealed under the 100 year order to avoid distressing the relatives and survivors.[18]

The released documents revealed that in 1991, following Hamilton's Loch Lomond summer camp, complaints were made to Central Scotland Police and were investigated by the Child Protection Unit. Hamilton was reported to the Procurator Fiscal for consideration of ten charges, including assault, obstructing police and contravention of the Children and Young Persons (Scotland) Act 1937. No action was taken.[19]

null,null,CyberGnat,null,null,null,"The question then is whether it is actually a proper benefit to society if people own their own homes. The key here is the 'otherwise would not be able to afford' bit - right to buy can't just magic the capital necessary for these people to suddenly own homes. The massive discounts effectively had the government transfer wealth down to those who were already wealthier than average for a council house tenant. Later, the capital for house ownership has been found by ever-increasing sizes of mortgages which have made British people some of the most indebted in the whole world. Those who have paid off most of their mortgage are going to face real problems in future because they all tend of be of one generation, and a huge number of them are going to have to try to sell their home to pay for future old-age care around the same time. A massive glut in supply will mean prices drop, so in the end these people won't have much more money than they started out with back when all this started.

It's maddening to see how some people think house ownership is possible on a massive scale in this country without it causing massive problems. There is only a limited area of the country that is actually suitable for housing development, so supply is always going to be extremely limited and thus prices are going to be above what the majority of people in society can actually afford.

The fundamental issue behind this is that land is not like other factors of production. The other factors of production have the possibility of supply increasing in future. It's not monopolistic to own a piece of machinery or more capital or to have enterprise since other people can have them at the same time, while only one person can own a (share of a) plot of land at one time. The supply of land is fixed because the geographic extents of the country are fixed and effectively always have been. Since the supply of land is so fixed and tied to the existence of the country as a state, it is unlike the other factors of production and thus it is not unreasonable for there to be significantly different economic policies in place for it. It would be more than feasible to have a fully capitalistic market in the other three factors of production but then to effectively ban the outright ownership of land itself. Economically, all that is really necessary is to ensure that all land rental value is captured in a Land Value Tax, such that ownership of land itself would not mean you would receive any more economic benefit than if you didn't own it.",null,0,null,1440666742,null,null,false,0,cuha0db,null,t3_3iiylx,null,null,null,t1_cugu58c,null,null,null,1441525426,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Firearms legislation has it's place, but as the UK shows, ultimately only enforcement of the laws is actually effective (firearms crime in the UK rose through the 90s and continued to rise even after Dunblane when handguns were banned - because only 1% of firearms crime actually involved legal firearms).

They have plenty of real people on the phone should you need it. Including access to your tutor. 

Last time I studied with them, you got text books and dvd's and all the material was also available on their online portal. Which means where ever you have Internet access you can get it. 

You will know at the beginning of the module when all the key pieces of work need to be in so you can plan. 

They also have a book called the good study guide which is incredibly useful if you are going back to study later In life.
