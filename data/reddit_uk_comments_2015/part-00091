He was impressive because of his sheer workrate and how talented he really is, but that was an emergency measure since we had no Matic or Mikel. 

4-2-3-1 with Oscar for me. 

Yes, we were dominated in the midfield but Oscar im hoping will impress, Willian's in good form, Hazard will be much better assuming we get a better ref this time. Verratti and the rest of PSG shouldn't have free reign to keep hacking his legs, they will be forced to give Hazard space. Matic, im worried about because I don't know his situation with his injury and if he's in top shape or not (he'll need to be), and Fabregas im hoping doesn't have a quiet game like he occasionally does. I really wish Mikel wasn't injured, he could bring physicality in the midfield if things start going bad. 

We are a different force at the bridge, Mourinho will know what changes to make to avoid getting dominated in midfield again and our players should be fired up. It has just started to hit me how big of a fucking game this is, the mood of excitement and nervousness is already hitting me, a feeling I haven't felt since last year. I'm BUZZING

Also, I'm preparing myself for Oscar getting benched, but I really wish he wouldn't. I get that Oscar's inconsistent, but if we want to have any kind of cohesive attack, Oscar absolutely has to be on the pitch. He is the glue in between defense and attack, and makes the transition seamless. 

And finally, I know Dave is in fucking fantastic form right now, but for this match, I'd start Luis. We need some kind of threat on the left hand side to unlock space for Hazard, and while Dave is miles ahead of the pack at being the best defending fullback in the Prem, he doesn't provide much going forward, and that's cuz he's out of position. 

This is my ideal lineup:
http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=6b43

In our attack, Oscar will go more centrally, and Ramires will make those runs to the right wing like he was against West Ham, and Matic and Fab will sit deeper. When we are back in our defensive shell, Fab will be up ahead of Matic and Ramires and will press with Hazard and Oscar.

as a good rule of thumb, be as argumentative as you want when it's not your article, but when you're representing your own blog it's always going to come off bad if you get into a pissing match, even if you're entitled to one. especially if you think a rumour will play itself out in time anyway.

If a team like Chelsea depended on the defensive prowess of attacking player like Hazard then Chelsea wouldn't have been competing for major trophies. We have world class defenders. If we concede a goal, it won't just be because Hazard failed to cover someone on his flank. He might be part of the problem, but Jose won't give him a big task of defending. Especially, a player who is really needed in the attacking third. How many times have we seen Hazard defending deep? Jose is sacrificing a player like Oscar for Ramires so that the team will be solid defending in big games. Hazard is not our last man defending nor is he the man protecting the back four. This articles here is making it seem like he is a left back that has been failing to protect his side. He has immensely improved in his defending abilities. Of all the famous attacking players, he is one of the few that track back. Btw, if he  plays the way he usually plays, then it would be the opposition defenders or the other players on his side that will be focusing their energy to stop him not the other way around. The best way he can protect his side is attacking not defending. His main focus should always be attacking and he should have the license to roam freely.

Fiscal conservatism (in the sense of making decisions that are anti-investment and anti-risk) would be too prevalent in the EU without the UK, as would social conservatism (in the true sense of embracing change in society at a fundamental level).

I consider myself pretty left of centre but I also understand that society needs to adapt and change to fit the ever approaching future, however I feel that Germany wants to cling to idealised old left mentality and compensate for it with its strengths in other areas like exports.

If Chelsea mostly play all season with Costa up top in a single striker formation, of course he's probably going to score more than anyone else in their side.

The reason people describe it as a problem for us is not in the statistic itself, but in what happens around the statistic.  In other words, we hardly ever look like scoring goals unless Eriksen or Kane chip in.  Chelsea for instance, can often rely on Terry to score a few headers from set pieces, or Ivanovic to bomb up the field and get the odd goal, Fabregas to get a few goals, and so on.  They're not gonna feature in the top three of their side's goal charts for the year, but they're reliable alternatives on the field.

And even if Costa got injured for the rest of the year, you still get the feeling they'd get the job done with Droga and Remy.  They're nowhere near the same class at the moment, but they can put the ball in the back of the net.

With us, we never look a threat with headers from set pieces, even with Fazio on the field, and we rarely have a multitude of goal scoring threats on the field at the same time.  We are one-dimensional in attack, and that causes us problems.

Where's our reliable striking backup?  We are honestly a Kane hamstring injury away from continue to challenge for top 4, or sinking down to 7th or 8th.

Now to give you an example. We've criticised Fernando a lot this season for losing the ball a lot and because he seems completely incapable of actually making a forward pass. He's good when he's not got the ball at his feet, but that's a very bad trait to have when you're a midfielder.

Now, Kompany is a class CB, but now realise that he'd actually be quite a downgrade on Fernando's already piss poor passing and mediocre on-ball ability. Suddenly it seems mental to put Kompany at DM, doesn't it?

You say fuck it and end up having a coke fueled orgy only for someone else to enter the room and start taking pictures on their Iphone. 

Those make a pretty damning statement in your divorce proceedings, where your now ex-wife will use most of your winnings to add to the breast transpants, ass transplants, vaginoplasty and lip augmentation. You look at her and can't recognize what used to be your girlfriend, but then again you can barely recognize yourself.  
This is all compounded by an embryo growing in her belly that you're not sure belongs to you, but Child Support needs to be paid, and it sure as hell isn't gonna be paid by your best mate, who's now shacked up with your rich ex-wife. 

You end up barely making rent in a shitty apartment with a shared bathroom and a meth addiction. You curse the day you made such a wish to the Reddit genie, convinced that if you keep rubbing your magic lamp maybe he'll show up again and grant you another wish. All you get is low sperm count all over your dirty pajamas. But then you turn on the TV, it's the Champions League final. Messi and Suarez start for Liverpool against Madrid in a match that would equal Madrid's decima. You'll remember the days we used to pray for 4th place and you'll whisper to yourself:

That we are in such debt during peacetime is quite unprecedented unless you look into the 18th century which imo cannot be comparable also because of the various wars we were involved in such as the American Revolution.

You cannot spend your way out of debt, even as a government. Increasing the size of the economy through investment is possible but imo would not produce enough return on investment to warrant plunging us into further debt. At the moment we pay more than £52bn a year on debt interest alone. This amount is not much shorter than half the NHS budget and is higher than the spending for education or defence. 

I know that government debt is very different to personal debt but much of the same lessons apply. You do not reduce your debt by attempting investment upon more debt taken but by cutting spending until your income exceeds your outgoings. 

Even assuming increased spending for growth, the only way for that to work is to effectively freeze budgets as they are or wait for a magical and mythical time where we will apparently have a perfect economy that generates lots of money and we can pay for everything while simultaneously paying down our debt.",null,0,null,1425970838,null,0,1425997930,0,cpa1jx6,null,t3_2yh3ig,null,t1_cpa1jx6,null,t1_cpa1cqy,null,null,null,1427676487,null,5,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,5,null

This contrasts with pretty much every other mainstream form of investment where you're saving post-tax income.  

Thus for the same amount taken from your post-tax income you end up with significantly more going into your pension pot than you would into an ISA or other investment, which means more for the miracle of compounding to work on.

The downside is that the income you eventually draw from your pension will be taxable whereas income from an ISA is not, although in most cases your income in retirement will be lower in real terms than it is now which could put you in a lower tax band.

The other downside of a pension is the relative inflexibility - you can't get the money out once until you hit the legally defined minimum age, currently 55 and set to rise.

null,false,prototype45,null,null,null,"I usually share the same thoughts as you /u/bustedracquet on these topics but wow I disagree with most of what you said here. 

I agree that Oscar has to start, he's not in the best of form but its harsh to judge him as his  performances haven't necessarily been *bad*, he's played much less lately and when he hasn't played well its usually when the rest of the team isn't either. 

&gt; And finally, I know Dave is in fucking fantastic form right now, but for this match, I'd start Luis.

This is where our thoughts diverge. Firstly, PSG has some very pacey players especially if Lucas and Van Der Wiel are starting, Dave is as good as any full back in the world at shutting down pacey players 1v1, its what he's best at. I will remind you what happened when Luis came up against a winger similar to Lucas. It was Carillo from Sporting who kept smoking luis and leaving him for dead. It happened over and over and over in that game, and thats not the only game where he's looked weak defensively. Are we sure we want to risk that happening again? He's not the same defender he was at Atleti (defensively). Secondly, we aren't going to be going full on attack unlike last year, we don't need Luis' offensive superiority. The only reason id start luis over dave is if we were playing a team like Crystal Palace whom we need to break down. Thirdly, like you said Dave is in fantastic form, he played brilliantly against tottenham and shut down the entire flank. Does Luis deserve to play more? Definitely. Should it be in the most important match of the season so far? No, that goes to the player that has proven to be the better fullback, and that is Dave. Dave was born for this type of game, PSG will come out guns blazing and we need the best defensive option on the flank to shut it down.

&gt; That being said, no way do I expect Jose to go with that, this is what I expect to see: http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=6b44

The only time Fabregas has played well as a number 10 was against stoke, and that was because Mikel's physical presence was needed. Numerous times mourinho has played cesc higher up and he barely sees the ball, goes invisible a lot of times. When he plays deeper alongside Matic, he plays much better, he gets much more of the ball and is much more comfortable distributing from deep. Ramires will be subbed on later, but we have to stick with what has worked best in the past, and that is a Matic-Fabregas Partnership. I understand that we have to adapt in certain games, but Fabregas looks very uncomfortable as a number 10. And with PSG's strong midfield pressing (he will be more isolated and they will surround and shut him down), he's definitely not going to see much of the ball, as PSG will be pushing forward a lot and our counters will be coming from deeper. Oscar would be the best option as the number 10 to keep pressing and pressuring the PSG defence (ideally luiz), something fabregas cant really do. 

With all that being said, I am in no way saying that you are wrong, I'm just offering my contrasting thoughts for the sake of this discussion.

The __State Second Pension__, or __S2P__, was introduced in the [UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) by the [Labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK\)) [Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government) on 6 April 2002, to replace the __SERPS__ (State Earnings Related Pension Scheme). The main aim of this change was to skew existing [Additional Pension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensions_in_the_United_Kingdom#Additional_Pension) (or *AP*) benefits in favour of low and moderate earners at the expense of higher earners and to extend access to include certain carers and people with long-term illness or disability for the first time.

Spending after that point sure as hell rose, but you can't say it's all down to war spending.

The thing is that you very much CAN spend your way out of debt, and worse consolidation and cutbacks can stop debt from being paid off:
You first have to ask how the public debt has responded historically to changes in public spending. Specifically, we need to regress DD, the change in the debt ratio (in percentage points) on DG, the percent change in nominal government purchases. The latter is the policy instrument, because it is the one thing over which the government has discretion. We exclude public transfers, which are endogenous to the state of the economy. If we consider eight peacetime data points, and transform the data into annual averages, we find:

DD = 1.8 - 0.6 DG	  N = 8  R2 =0.98

The negative slope coefficient is what makes fiscal consolidation counterproductive. Correspondingly, the government can spend its way out of debt. In fact, the equation implies that the debt/GDP ratio will fall only when public spending growth exceeds 3 per cent per year.",null,0,null,1425972800,null,0,false,0,cpa22ae,null,t3_2yh3ig,null,t1_cpa22ae,null,t1_cpa1jx6,null,null,null,1427676727,null,4,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,4,null

null,false,ehazoo,null,null,null,"I know some of you might not wanna hear anything baseball related, but the way FSG approached the Red Sox offseason might provide some clues for what happens with Liverpool in the summer transfer window. 

The brain trust of Boston noticed that the game was transitioning towards pitching and defense over the last several years, so they used their assets to stockpile (some would even say, overpay) for the scarce factor in baseball, elite offense.  They spent $260 million combined on three players - Hanley Ramirez, Pablo Sandoval and a 19 year old Cuban named Yoan Moncada. 

How does this relate to Liverpool you might say? Well, it proves FSG is willing to spend vast amounts of money - in the right situation. The Red Sox had their other holes filled with cheap, young players, so they could afford to flash the cash at serious talent and 'overpay'. They were willing to incur a 32 million dollar tax just to sign a kid who's never played a single game in the States. Perhaps if they feel that the young, controllable Liverpool core of Moreno, Coutinho, Henderson, Sterling, Sturridge, Markovic, Can, Ibe, Sakho, etc can reach the next level (PL titles) with one or two splurges, they may go for it based on their history.

Any sensible analysis would exclude such times due to the vastly different conditions. Even the 18th century contains spikes entirely created *by wars*.

The great depression is barely a blip compared to the horror of the Napoleonic Wars and WW2 with its associated post war rebuilding.

**I would also strongly appreciate it if you did not copy paste your responses from articles from the internet in lieu of a proper argument**

&gt;ask how the public debt has responded historically to changes in public spending. Specifically, they regress DD, the change in the debt ratio (in percentage points) on DG, the percent change in nominal government purchases. The latter is the policy instrument, because it is the one thing over which the government has discretion. Reasonably, they exclude public transfers, which are endogenous to the state of the economy. The data come from a century of annual observations, condensed into ten sub-periods of varying length. Two of these are the world wars, which they exclude as exceptional. With eight peacetime data points, and the data transformed into annual averages, they find:

&gt;DD = 1.8 - 0.6 DG	    N = 8     R2 = 0.98                ...(1)

&gt;The negative slope coefficient is what, on their account, makes fiscal consolidation counterproductive. Correspondingly, the government can spend its way out of debt. In fact, the equation implies that the debt/GDP ratio will fall only when public spending growth exceeds 3 per cent per year.

In theory, if an assailant controlled a large proportion of all entry and exit nodes, they could potentially take a guess at a link between person A and website X by the times that the packets are forwarded, but it's far from reliable.

In the meantime, we recommend to our clients that they maximise ISA contributions (much more slack here now with £15,000 allowances; effectively £30,000 PA per couple).

My feeling is that QROPS, QNUPS, FURBS, are all fraught with difficulty. High costs and opaque pricing result in a poor marketplace, with a high risk of fraud and misselling.

VCT, EIS and S-EIS are less problematic, but so high risk (and typically those risks have not been well-rewarded) that they tend only to be useful in fringe cases (think BIG income tax bill).

Judicious use of CGT allowances in unwrapped investments and sensible allocation of funds plus full use of ISA allowances should result in a reasonable setup.

By this I mean; all income-producing assets wrapped within pension and ISA with growth assets held in unwrapped accounts. This means that you shelter income through wrappers and manage CGT by sale-and-rebuy in the unwrapped accounts.

If you're fond of index trackers, the sale of one global index fund and purchase of another is a perfectly legitimate transaction for CGT purposes, where the sale and repurchase of the same fund isn't.

This is often an issue when the Parliamentary Accounts Committee are taking HMRC's top people to task. However, it's of note that since Dave Hartnett left HMRC, tax knowledge at the top of HMRC has been thin on the ground. Additionally, tax knowledge is never really in play, since HMRC's top people invariably indulge in excuse theater.

All that said, it's important to bear in mind that the PAC doesn't really have any power, beyond the ability to publicly berate. Despite all the issues, this is the value the PAC, as led by Hodge has had.

All the information about HMRC crushing the whistleblower Osita Mba became public due to PAC hearings. Lin Homer refusing to rule out the use of RIPA powers to investigate, the same. HMRC's handling of the Vodafone and Goldman Sachs settlements; issues with adequate staffing to address mail and phone calls and, the fact that HMRC appointed as its most senior non-executive a man on record as writing that taxation is nothing more than extortion.

They can't change any of these things, but they bring them to the public awareness. The government of the day (either flavour) will only respond if the public angrily demands it. *(And they should demand it.) The PAC is one of the few ways they get information.

The [Phase II Trial](http://hwmaint.meeting.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/29/15_suppl/10007) suggests this extra four months will be beset with some quite unpleasant side-effects, but generally speaking NICE will ignore side-effects when dealing with very very end-of-life treatments, on the assumption that patients care less about them than about getting a few extra months to spend with loved ones.

This gives the effective cost / quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) as about £54,000. NICE estimates that at the margin the NHS can buy one QALY for about £20,000 to £30,000. This means that for every healthy year you buy using this drug, you deny someone else two to three healthy life-years.

I don't think this is open-and-shut because we often fudge the health economic arguments when it comes to very rare or very terminal diseases, and £54,000 / QALY isn't *crazy* compared to some other drugs which we tacitly approve for off-label use (although because Regorafenib is only indicated where Gleevec and Sutent have failed it is likely a lot more expensive than that when taking hospital utilisation into account, and the Phase III trial doesn't look to have amazing confidence intervals so we probably can't be sure that four months is right). I think overall the cancer drugs fund is a net bad for the NHS because it diverts money away from those who need it and into treating those with good PR, but given that we have to have a cancer drugs fund Regorafenib doesn't seem like a horrible drug to have on it.",null,0,null,1425980304,null,0,false,0,cpa3o3u,null,t3_2ygv0j,null,t1_cpa3o3u,null,t1_cp9eaxs,null,null,null,1427677475,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

You're 25? That means that you have the means to get towards riding any size of bike you want. And if you only want to ride a 125cc, there's nothing wrong with that - they're fantastic commuting vehicles. And, they can get you from A to C too, as long as you don't mind taking the scenic route (:  
But all you need is a provisional driver's licence and a CBT and you can get on a 125cc motorbike with max 11~~BHP~~kW [which is 15BHP]

As for your chunky monkey question: you get some big people on bikes. While learning, a 125 is capable of carrying it, but some may look tiny under you, others will be fine. Height will also play a part in this.  
But to be honest: you ride for yourself, not what someone else thinks you should be like [apart from instructors/examiners]  
You'd likely want to have the rear suspension adjusted and run the tyres at a greater pressure though.  

Balance? Balance isn't a problem at higher speeds [above ~10mph], lower than that you'll get it quite quickly. You'll probably drop the bike while learning at least once. Nothing to worry about, most of us have done it in some form.

Arguably the Napoleonic Wars showed some regards of total war too, hence the incredibly high debt levels. When the country's existence is threatened, it does not matter how high the debt goes which is why they are special cases. It makes sense to distinguish between peacetime and wartime.

Also consider the kinds of conflicts before the last fifteen years. The decolonialisation wars across the former empire, the Korean war, the Falklands and the gulf war. They ranged from smaller than Iraq to larger. A wide spectrum to choose from.

Of particular note is the Korean war which was on a very large scale with more than one thousand British dead. This war, like many of the ones I have mentioned occurred in a time of rapidly decreasing debt for the most part.

The argument I would make in regards to spending is that it is not necessarily the place of government to tax, spend and invest in the economy. Regardless of what the government does, the majority of investment will occur in the private sector anyway. Public services are often done at a level far below profit margins and will hence not provide economic growth. I'm no ardent capitalist by any means, I just think that private enterprise is better at conducting economic growth than the government due to its inherent nature.

The reason for these ""proprietary labs"" as you put it is that undertaking drug research is fantastically expensive. The amount of benefit to be derived from knowledge sharing on ""similar"" (?) compounds is likely to be fairly minimal, and in my 5 years in the industry I am not aware of there having been a single case of two or more manufacturers conducting serious research on the same compound simultaneously. All this ""knowledge sharing"" would do is eliminate much of the benefit to performing research at all, and manufacturers would move their research elsewhere to keep their secrets secret.

&gt; Drugs companies benefit massively from publicly funded research taking place at universities around the world and contribute competitively little in return to the costs of that research - so find some way to get ROI.

Drugs companies also fund a *massive* amount of research, both in their own labs and at universities.

I actually agree with you here, but it's hard to envision the alternative I think.

If you mean, why is r/Scotland so 'pro-indepenence'. You are right there is clear imbalance towards YES. Around 8/2 for.  I think there is a variety of reasons for this.
  
**I would give the following reasons as facts**   
- The demographics of reddit match quite closely the demographics of YES voters.    
- Any forum which has an impartial infrastructure (does not encourage one side over the other) tends to start leaning towards YES. Look at EVERY SINGLE DEBATE which took a before and after poll.  
   
**I would also give the following reasons as opinions**   
- People tend to migrate to YES once they have taken the time to hear the arguments. This was clear in the polls during the IndyRef which moved from about 33% to around 45% during the course of the campaign.  
- Redditors are a little more educated and open minded than average.  

Anyone on here who uses the terms circle-jerk or echo-chamber are succumbing to some serious cognitive biases. (Anything to justify facts which do not align with their opinions). It is quite insulting to their fellow redditors. Basically labelling them sheep and assuming they do not seek information elsewhere.

Putting the law to one side a moment, I can completely see and sympathise the mentality “I don’t want to die on this road, I’ll ride on the pavement for my own protect”. But then as a pedestrian I am obliged to think “I don’t want to worry about dodging bikes on this pavement, I wish they’d sod off into the road”. 

Given curbs, people, stuff left in streets, doors being opened onto streets and car doors being opened by people leaving their cars (plus all the other obstructions you could think of on a pavement) I’d say cyclists belong more in the road than on the pavement – for everyone’s sake. 

It all boils down that we *need* a decent infrastructure. Pedestrians can’t help but use the pavement – which is for their use. Cars are catered for by roads. Cyclists exist in this weird limbo where there’s sort of a provision but it’s easy to be buffeted around by the actions of others (and I hate to say it - *bad* / negative cyclists don’t do themselves any favours here in terms of how they’re perceived and dealt with. If I see someone acting dangerously on the road, my instinct is to want to be well past them or away from them as quickly as possible – if that’s a cyclist and I’m a car then that means overtaking ASAP).

However, if you are stressed, my advice would be to get signed off by the doctor (which is invariably 2 weeks for stress) and then immediately resign, bringing your actual working time down to 2 weeks.

That said, I guess you're looking at it from a UX perspective rather than a technical perspective, and for that all I can say is that if we did develop it, we would try to make it as pain-free as possible!

As for EPOS, it's worth noting that the module isn't yet open source, as there's some sensitive data that we need to obscure before we can do that, but we will be setting up a demo of that too.

r/Scotland is largely SNP &gt; The SNP are largely nationalist &gt; r/Scotland is largely nationalist. 

People vote SNP for all different reasons. The current polls clearly show that there are a great number of NO voters supporting the SNP. I am ignoring this bullshit argument. We are NOT discussing the SNP. You are obsessed.

&gt; I call it nationalism because it's nationalism. Borders, separation, ensuring the primacy of the nation state.
  
Right I will accept THIS as your definition of nationalism and address them directly.
  
**Borders** - I flat out refuse to believe that Independence would lead to increased border controls. The argument was even rubbished by many in Better-Together after the IndyRef was over.      
**Separation** - I firmly believe that Scotland being in control of its own budget and spending would heal a lot of the divisions between Scots and English in particular. Many in England are aggrieved that Scots recieve greater spending. We are seen as scroungers. In Scotland we take exception to this. We believe we contribute a higher than average amount of taxes and want to be free to choose to manage our funding without criticism. It is DEVOLUTION which causes division. West Lothian and EVEL are both symptoms. There would be less acrimony if we just managed our own wallets.  
**ensuring the primacy of the nation state** Yes, and this is happening already under devolution. It is perfectly possible for a country to look out for its own interests but still form valued and genuinely humanitarian alliances with their neighbours. For the most part the current UK behaves this way and I would hope/expect an independent Scotland to do the same. Under devolution, this is simply not possible. It is a stilted form of democracy.

You mention you don't like cars and you're not into the open road but you may find that changes as you get more comfortable with the mechanics and the functionality of riding.

Talking about your weight /size; When I did my 4 day Direct access course and test I was roughly 24Stone, I'm also 6' 2"" tall with 34"" inside leg and a 56"" chest.

The first day was on a Yamaha YBR125 and it wasn't much fun. being a bigger person means that on a 125 you look like a circus bear on a tricycle. The bike struggled to pull my weight on hills and I couldn't find a decent position that didn't have my knees interfering with my elbows without having my legs sticking out like a GP rider on a corner.. this had the knock-on effect that I couldn't grip the tank with my knees/thighs, which makes you less stable.

Thankfully I stuck out the miserable first day for the CBT certificate and then they put us on Honda cb500s for the rest of the it.. so much better in every way, wider bike, more weight in it, better riding position, able to grip properly with my legs and so on..

Anyway, my point is that you might find a small bike a bit uncomfortable, but you're old enough that you can go for the DAS test and pick up something like a 500 or 600cc commuter bike (cb500, er5, gs500, fazer, hornet, etc) that will have no problem with your weight or size, the added benefit being that it'll most likely be cheaper to buy than a decent 125 would anyway.

Well if you can't work out what is a cycle lane and what isn't then I'd err on the side of caution and use the road - but it should be *fairly* clear. Any examples of the kind of thing you're not sure of? 

&gt; Councils are busy trying to squeeze cycling onto pavements, and the legality has no bearing on the actual safety or conflict with pedestrians.

True, but that's a problem with the infrastructure and they need to hear that feedback. 

&gt; Also walking alongside your bike takes up MORE space than riding it slowly &amp; carefully, which creates more conflict and less space - you can't ride on the road next to your child on the pavement either as you're too unpredictable to be safe in road traffic as your child will have to stop, give way, etc when the road doesn't - so riding with your kid on the pavement is a necessity.

That depends on the speed you're travelling at etc. and if it's that dangerous to have your child in the road that you need to be a hazard on the pavement (or take up more space than a single file ride should need) then you probably ought not cycle there. 

I'd always err on the side of caution - it's not a right to be allowed to cycle on the pavement as an adult. 

&gt; Getting off and walking defeats the point of cycling, it means some journeys will become impractical due to time constraints, and in much of the country outside of london will leave people isolated unless they have cars.

That really depends on exact circumstances - let's not cherry pick examples to prove our point there. Yes it might be inconvenient to have to walk but that's your problem - it shouldn't be everyone else's problem because you're selfish and want to cycle on the pavement. 

&gt; Riding on the pavement carefully &amp; slowly doesn't put anybody at risk - most shared usage off-road trails and bridleways are as narrow as pavements, and often in worse condition.

Well here in Birmingham I *daily* see cyclists riding at speed along pavements, exiting and entering roads from the curb without indicating, not using lights in dusk or dark conditions and the list goes on...

Do you really believe this is the tactic we go about with? There is a lot more going on tactically than that.

&gt;I love Chelsea with all my heart but the football we play, especially in the champions league is boring and safe. We have the away goal against PSG and I have no doubt in my mind that Mou will park the bus for the whole game unless PSG score (in which they definitely can). It's a waste of a match of football. Last week PSG played 100x better than what we did. I want Chelsea to play real football and not boring football.

Getting a 1-1 draw @PSG is not an easy thing to do. Their home record is astonishing. We will be looking to score and help the game in our favor. But you also have to defend that away goal you worked for. PSG is a top 5 team in the world. You can't push them around and attack the whole time. No team could do this to them without being punished by goals. 

&gt;Don't you agree? I'm sure that some of you who say that you don't would be pissed of with other teams that use the same ""tactic"" against us.

We have a balanced team. We attack and we defend. It's what makes us one the best in the world. There is plenty of times when we are going full throttle at teams.

I actually really like Mignolet but we ask our keeper to do a lot of things he's just not very good at.

Gerrard leaving is a big hit in the middle of the pitch.  Lucas and Allen are a bit more injury prone than you'd expect as well, they seem to pick up little knocks and muscle problems and miss a few weeks here and there multiple times per season.  we could really use a big presence in the middle of the pitch.  Ideally, we'd have a very athletic, powerful, composed defensive player come in to sweep up play and protect our back line in order to let players like Can, Henderson, and Coutinho play more end to end.

One: Save it until you need it or have a really good use for it.

At your age you are likely to have a use or need for it within the next few years.

Two: Buy something that will pay back later, perhaps something that you have more time to pursue now than you might later. Avoid ""life coaching"", courses on how to make money and scammy business opportunities :) The only example I can think of is getting a driving license (if you don't already have one).

null,false,boardsandbikes,null,null,null,"It's been touched on already, but I think we need to look at changing formation again. 3-4-2-1 has worked a treat in stopping us conceding so many goals, but it is now starting to limit us in options going forward.

I think we need to look at going back to 3 alternatives: 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1 (both pretty similar, but slight tactical changes in midfield) and potentially 4-4-2.

4-3-3 first: Give Can or Lucas the DM role and make them SIT. They do not move forward and they cover the hell out of our central defense. This should mean that we do not require 3 CBs, as we should still always have at least 3 defensive players. This also allows Manquillo more playing time at RB, who IMO is quality. Play Hendo/Allen or Hendo/Coutinho as the CM in front of the DM and play any three of Sterling/Lallana Sturridge/Balotelli Ibe/Markovic. Provides genuine width, and will hopefully leave the central areas free for late runs by Hendo/Allen/Coutinho.

4-2-3-1: Basically similar to above, but if we are playing someone like Arsenal or Chelsea who will look to dominate with midfield runners, we need more protection in front of the back four. I'd play any two of Can/Lucas/Allen but again, make sure that they limit their forays forward. Put Hendo as CAM and then as usual any three of the above wingers/strikers in front. The problem with this is there is the opportunity for Coutinho to miss out, but he can play on the wing, or take Hendo's place if we need more attacking impetus.

4-4-2 (diamond): Going back to the heights of last season MAY give us a different option, and allow Sturridge and Balotelli a few more goes to gel together (if they can). Play Can/Lucas as DM, then Allen + Hendo in front, with Sterling/Lallana/Coutinho as the CAM. Problems with this are a serious lack of width, meaning it could be easy to play against by flooding the midfield.

4-4-2 (old school): Bear with me on this one. It's definitely out of vogue, but we do have the players. Depending on how attacking we want to be, the CMs can be any combination of Can/Lucas/Hendo/Allen. If we're looking for protection then play Can + Lucas. Play Ibe and Sterling on the wings and make sure they beat the full back, putting low crosses into the box or creating overloads with attacking fullbacks (Moreno/Manquillo) who can do this. Sturridge and Balotelli can feed off this.

In all of these my preferred back four would be Manquillo+Skrtel+Sakho+Moreno. I do think that this summer we need a slightly more experienced RB, I know much has been made of Porto's Danilo, who would be perfect.

I also know that I've made much of Balotelli, including playing him by himself. This is still a role he can play, but he does have to change his focus, and make sure that he doesn't drop too deep.

With respect, I don't believe it does anything of the sort. It isn't a joke about ALL gay people. Its a joke about a single gay person, just like there are thousands of jokes about Scottish, English, Irish, Polish, black, white, disabled, blind, deaf, old, men or women. 

&gt;Now rape, rape isn't funny. Even slightly. 

Murder isn't funny, but there are lots of jokes that end with someone's death. This is often rated as one of the funniest jokes:

&gt;A couple of  hunters are out in the woods when one of them falls to the ground. He doesn't seem to be breathing, his eyes are rolled back in his head. The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps to the operator: ""My friend is dead! What can I do?"" The operator, in a calm soothing voice says: ""Just take it easy. I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead."" There is a silence, then a shot is heard. The guy's voice comes back on the line. He says: ""OK, now what?""

Is that joke not funny? Should it not be told in case it offends someone who lost a family member to a shooting?

I applied to them out of sheer desperation, it was an absolute last resort, the last thing I wanted to do was to take out a loan that I knew would only make things worse in the long run but I'd reached such a low point that it was a viable option. 

It took a long time to get things figured out, and actually I've recently found myself in a difficult financial situation again after losing my job before Xmas- luckily I found work quite quickly but I drained my savings in the process which has meant I've needed to get a new credit card to keep up with some horribly big expenses I've got coming up.

&gt;In the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), due to the small [loading gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loading_gauge), the railway system cannot accommodate double-deck trains. A modest attempt at double decking was made in 1948 on the [Southern Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Railway_(Great_Britain\)) with the two trains of the [Bulleid 4DD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SR_Class_4DD) class. Although innovative, with stepped compartments, where the bottoms of the upper seats are above the heads of the people on the lower level, but the feet of the people above are not, see,  the loading gauge severely restricted their use and they were removed from service in 1971.

The next big step in this team's evolution will be developing end product from wide positions.

This territory had previously been part of the kingdom of Poland. The population in the former German Empire bits was mixed and had been since the middle ages, though in the 1930s many of the Germans in Poland supported Hitler.

After the second world war, Stalin did something a lot more drastic; he redrew Polish borders a lot further west and incorporated bits of Germany that had never been part of Poland (i.e. East Prussia). He also ordered that the German population be removed and replaced with Poles who were moved from the bits of eastern Poland that Stalin gave to Belarus and Ukraine.

I have no special dislike of Muslims / Islamic people but every dislike of those who do choose to self-segregate and cause trouble in this country and abroad. That's nothing to do with their faith and everything to do with their behaviour.

Or could they have done more? 

If they could have done more - well it's important that's addressed and that families do take responsibility for the raising of their children appropriately.

Based on [this data](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/proven-reoffending-statistics-april-2011-march-2012) sex offenders have some of the lowest chances of re-offending, roughly the same as motoring offences and only higher than fraud.

On average, between 2000 and 2012, 13% of those convicted of sexual offences re-offended (including any kind of new offence), compared with 19% of those convicted for violence against a person, 39% robbery, 41% theft, 26% criminal damage/arson.

Fraud is 16%, but that's skewed by a higher rate in the early 00s, so is now lower, summary motoring offences are at 17%.

Obviously this could mean that the sex offender registry is working, although as the current Violent and Sexual Offender Registry was only introduced in 2003-4 (and doesn't seem to have impacted re-offending rates), perhaps it is more of a ""oh no, sex is evil, something must be done!"" issue.",null,0,null,1425996432,null,0,false,0,cpa8j8w,null,t3_2yih9s,null,t1_cpa8j8w,null,t1_cpa342j,null,null,null,1427679814,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

The focus is on savings/assets and debt (hence title is *wealth* not income), but they do link it to income (especially chapter 2). As I take it, main point is that poor/young are relying on credit as their income does not cover expenditure, cannot save etc. For 26-35yr olds in particular, wages in real-terms have fallen the most while living costs have risen, meaning greater reliance on credit. If you started off wealthy/home owner, it's been easier for you to accumulate wealth over the years (even with some real-term wage drop). Basically, not only has the income inequality widened over last decade, we also see it in overall wealth. I assume this has implications re. economic policy, as if we are to rely on greater consumption we'd be relying on higher income/home owning groups- because we don't really want everything to be on credit.

Personally I think it's a very simple report with unsurprising conclusions- But it's an interesting dataset tracking long-term asset change, which is relatively rare.

Now, 40 years later, these working class families can now afford to go away to Lanzarote or Benidorm for the same as what it would have cost to have a holiday in Blackpool.  So the main tourism industry died, and a lot of the local businesses died with it. 

I think the main complaint about Blackpool comes from this - it still has the bright lights and promises of a magical holiday, but in reality it's just another working class city with crap weather 9 months a year. 

In terms of living there, it has places to eat out, it has cinemas, it has a theme park, it has amusement arcades.  The nightlife gets a fair share of stag and hen parties.  There are worse places in the country to live.

Weeellll, for the longest time he really couldn't.  The season we got promoted we couldn't win at home for half the season with the most expensive squad in the league, which kept us from winning the league, and forced us into the playoffs.  The next two seasons the wins were far and few between.  We've had a lot of draws.

The only time since promotion where we've been truly successful was the first half of this year.  And at this point, Carroll and Nolan were injured and forced to be set aside, which lead to a rejuvenated Downing in the center and Sakho/Valencia playing lights out.

As soon as Carroll and Nolan were healthy they were shoved back in, Downing shuffled back to the wing, and we started drawing and losing instead of winning.

I don't know how I feel about Allardyce, really, I'm somewhat neutral to him.  But I don't think he is able or willing to play to his team's strengths.  He does it his way regardless of how well it works.  Which means playing Kevin Nolan and Andy Carroll over anyone regardless of form.

Isn't the Conservative's full name ""the Conservative and Unionist party""? Doesn't the Labour party's clause IV commit them to ""the defence and security of the British people""?

Those both sound pretty nationalist by your criteria.

&gt; The SNP's prime goal is borders and separation, that's what drives their behaviour. If it was just about 'Focussing on scotland' then they'd be pro-devolution and be campaigning only for devo max, which they've never done.

I believe [Sturgeon said](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/scottish-politics/sturgeon-snp-will-take-home-rule-fight-to-westminster.1422550333) ""we'll make Westminster stick to their vow, not just to grant more powers for Scotland, but the most powers - the meaningful powers we need *to make home rule a reality* for Scotland"".

That sounds pretty much like what campaigning for devo-max. Is your objection that they'd also campaign for other things? Can parties not say ""X is good, extending X to Y would be better""?


&gt; They weren't even pro-devolution in the late 90s, it was labour that were campaigning for this.

I assume you're referring to the [Scottish Constitutional Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Constitutional_Convention), which they did in fact participate in. They withdrew when the other parties refused to even countenance the idea that independence might be a constitutional option.

Do you live in an alternative reality where the SNP actually campaigned against the 1997 devolution referendum, the 1979 devolution referendum, or the 1949 Scottish Covenant? In this world they were pretty instrumental in all three.

&gt;It's a nonsense to suggest that the Lib Dems are nationalist for not focussing on france - the country the SNP operate in is the UK, likewise for the Lib dems.

The country the SNP operate in is Scotland. The countries (plural) that the Lib Dems operate in are Scotland, England, and Wales.

Both parties operate in some of the countries within the UK - neither stand in all of the UK.

If you want to say ""Scotland isn't a country, it's just a region"" because you believe only independent states are countries then we'll have to disagree. The problem with a semantic argument like that is that, while it's cute to argue on the internet, 99% of the people in Scotland would answer yes to ""is Scotland is a country"" (just as 99% of people in England would).

I'm not quite sure how you square the circle that parties not standing in Northern Ireland is fine but parties not standing in England/Wales is not fine (or even why it's a problem).

&gt; The SNP want to put borders up within that recognised international state. Those borders just happen to lead to the creation of a Scottish-only state, which will be 99% comprised of Scots.

The border already exists within the UK of course. Have a large drink in Carlisle and you're fine to drive, until you get to Gretna where you may have committed an offence.

I've no idea where you get the idea that independence would lead to a ""Scottish-only state"". About 10% of people in Scotland were born elsewhere in the UK (and more outside the UK of course), and as far as I know nobody has any plans to deport them.

&gt;Again - if it wasn't about nationalism, they'd stand candidates in northern england.

Why don't the Lib Dems or Labour run in Northern Ireland? Does that make them nationalists?

&gt; God knows Salmond got great applause when he's turned up to question time in northern england, but the SNP's nationalist obsession prevents them from doing this - they don't want to be anything other than a purely scottish party.

I don't believe they've got any intention of standing outside Scotland, but I don't know if that matches your expectations of what a ""purely Scottish party"" is. They certainly don't require you to be born in Scotland, or even live in Scotland, to join.

Your arguments seem to be a mixture of ""all nationalism is bad"" (when clearly it's not), and that ""not standing outside Scotland is bad"" (but only Scotland apparently), and some unspecified ""Scottish-only"" test (that nobody else seems to apply).

The real message, I think, is to tell young women that they don't have to start a family in their twenties because society deems that as a ""good age"". They should spend more time developing their careers in their twenties so they can get to a position in their thirties where having a family and taking time off will not affect their career as much as pissing off for 6 months during an internship would.

If you're not already doing these things the ""free"" way (eg, bodyweight exercises, instructional Youtube videos for things, your own practice, seeking speakers of foreign languages to converse with for free/in exchange for English conversation) then question if spending money would actually give you the motivation to do them (hint: generally, no) or would be wasted.

Introducing small numbers of lynx in controlled trials in Scotland would be fascinating to see if we could reduce the numbers of their prey and what wider-reaching impacts this would have. It's already been documented in Yellowstone in the USA that reintroducing wolves has helped the structure of riverbanks, with less deer eating plants that provide structural support to the soil.

You will no be referred to a dermatologist unless treatment from the GP doesn't work. In most cases people do not need to see a dermatologist.

My experience so far:

* Started about to years ago and was given some topical creams which didn't really help.

* After 4 months I was put on some medication which worked well for the first 6 or 7 months and then stopped working

* Tried about 3 or 4 more medications over the next year or so, none worked

* Was referred to a dermatologist and given roaccutane. This has worked wonders but the side effects are much worse than anything the GP gave me (which is why your GP can't prescribe and they get you to try other stuff first).

* I'm now 3 months into the roaccutane course and will be taking it for another 3 months. It's  a bit of a pain because you need to have a pregnancy test each month done at the hospital to be given the next months supply, but otherwise it works well.

Here is a google drive link for my numbers:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6mVLAzM8pFwNEdGMUFQeDR1eEE/view?usp=sharing

The numbers I got from here, although they only credit us 1 goal from a corner. I will give credit to Liverpool for the Henderson corner against Swansea, where Shelvey scored an own goal.

My analysis shows that we have scored 2, arguably 3 goals from corners. This is in comparison to the 10 we scored from corners in EPL last year after the same amount of rounds. We have had 157 corners so far this season in all competitions. Compare this to the number of corners in the EPL after the same amount of rounds, 164 (took avg corners over the whole season from here, and multiplied by 28)

IN 2013/2014 WE SCORED A GOAL EVERY 16-ish CORNER! 

The 2-0 goal against Villa could be a 3rd goal for this season, but in my opinion the goal happens way too long after the corner.

For conceded goals, I have given credit to West Ham for their long throw in. If we omit this one, the avg corners per goal goes from 29 to 34.

Games with the most corners for Liverpool was against Hull (14 corners, 0 goals) and against Arsenal (10 corners, 1 goal).

Interesting fact is that we have conceded more corners then we get (172 vs 157). This gives an avg corners per match at 4,49 for Liverpool and 4,91 for our opponent.

TLDR; We don't score from corners anymore.

Vehicles are only obliged to stop ONCE the pedestrian is already on the crossing. Standing on the pavement patiently waiting to cross doesn't count as on the crossing, unfortunately. 

Rules in the highway code are only legal requirements if highlighted with 'MUST/MUST NOT', below are the rules surrounding zebra crossings;

* look out for pedestrians waiting to cross and be ready to slow down or stop to let them cross
* you MUST give way when a pedestrian has moved onto a crossing
* do not wave or use your horn to invite pedestrians across; this could be dangerous if another vehicle is approaching
* be aware of pedestrians approaching from the side of the crossing.

Note how despite all of the very obvious, very sensible recommendations there are no laws saying cars HAVE to stop. Similarly with the highway code rules on indicators, it's a fucking ridiculous situation that might have made sense when they wrote it, but in reality often doesn't work.

&gt;

&gt;The __race to the bottom__ is a [socio-economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics) phenomenon in which governments [deregulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deregulation) the business environment or taxes in order to attract or retain economic activity in their jurisdictions, resulting in lower wages, worse working conditions and fewer [environmental protections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_protection). An outcome of [globalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization) and [free trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade), the phenomenon may occur when competition increases between geographic areas over a particular sector of trade and production.

Your GP is fully qualified to treat acne that is mild to moderate, and can prescribe a wide range of drugs individually or in combination (it is normal to try two or three, do not get disheartened). They should be referring to an NHS dermatologist if the acne is severe, causing scarring or mental health issues, or not responding to treatment.

On prescription are relatively gentle (but still effective) topicals such as niacinamide and azelaic acid, through oral antibiotics, through isotretinoin which is only prescribable by a hospital dermatologist due to potentially horrendous side effects (but highly effective for those who do not respond to other treatments).

Things you can do for yourself which are beneficial for mental wellbeing and skin health include taking an honest look at your diet and lifestyle choices. Ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle. Most people don't even know what they all are, let alone follow them and they really are minimums/ maximums/ serving sizes not optimal.

I also didn't say that Germany was slower than Britain technologically - obviously, Germany is a world leader in some areas of tech. But with digital start-ups in the Silicon Valley mold, they've definitely been slower. I've read this is perhaps down to the lack of entrepreneurial spirit in Germany, compared to the US in particular.

Everything from wealthy and ""proper"" to lower class people on benefits. Many of them come from middle class backgrounds with respectable parents in the medical community; you simply can't just say ""oh their parents are to blame"" for most of these cases.

&gt;How many parents do you know where their children smoke or drink without them knowing, and those same parents would say their children were normal or good or whatever?

How many parents do you know who keep tabs on their kids 24/7? I smoked for years before my parents found it. Because kids are sneaky. My parents aren't bad parents because they weren't watching me 24/7 and checking to make sure I wasn't smoking out of the window at 2am. How were they to know? They have lives as well, they can't watch everything I do, and I can hide it from them and lie easily anyway

All I'm saying is when you look at these situations in other contexts, whether it's young people running off with a teacher, young people meeting someone online and running away with them, young people falling into a bad crowd and getting into crime, young people meeting older people and run away to join cults like the Manson Family. 

In all of these situations, the parents will often be good parents. The truth is, you can be the best parent in the world and still produce Adolf Hitler or Josef Frtizl. People like to blame it on the parents because it's easier than accepting there are bad people who are bad from birth and there's nothing they can do to stop them being bad

The point is, in all of these case the parents had no idea. Whether the kids are falling into bad crowds, meeting bad people online, or drinking on the streets, no parent can keep tabs on their kid 24/7 and watch over everything they do on the internet or out of the home. You can't keep tabs on kids 24/7. The only way these parents could have prevented this was 24/7 monitoring, and no leaving the house. Is that being a good parent? I don't think so, it's about finding the balance. Too much minitoring and control will only push them into the arms of ISIS or whoever more. 

But the truth is you can watch your kids all day long and you can raise them the best you can, but if they're bad apples it doesn't matter how you raise them, and you can watch them 23 hours of the day but they will always find a way to get away from you and do what they want. They will hide it from you like smoking or drinking or anything else. I don't blame these parents for not knowing something their kids would have gone to great lengths to conceal and deny.

Yeah they can but they've always been able to do background checks. This is no different than someone questioning your old teachers, priest, employer to see if you've been radicalised or something along those lines. The security forces don't care if your really into tween music videos, keen on solar power or adamant  about the benefits of the alternative vote. Besides, to know most of our political beliefs and social groups all they have to do is look at Facebook. That is all accessible to a privet company, you can't expect to keep any of that privet if you put it up their yourself. 

It is our responsibility as voters to keep out a government that doesn't want to hunt down and kill anyone who watched gangnam style. That said information exits isn't a problem if we don't make it one. We should also remember that politicians don't have access to all this data and never should, that's when its time to protest.

MI5 has been working alongside banks for years going over peoples accounts to check if their was anything suspicious (that's one of the main ways they identified terrorists). As for the post office they did that. They used to have special techniques for opening letters in such a way that the final recipient wouldn't know. That's why cyphers aren't a knew idea. This hasn't made our country a bad place to live. We still live in one of the most liberal countries on earth and I don't think GCHQs ability to store communication data is going to change that. 

None of this affects free speech. All it lets the securities do is see who is saying what to who. That sounds pretty bad but its the best way to stop people who want to do actual harm to our democracy. Most of this data is going to sit completely ignored for 5 years and then get deleted, its not even going to get viewed. The small amount that is actually used can be the difference between an attack and a successful arrest. That slightly uncomfortable feeling that we get when we think about how someone may be looking at what we're doing is a small price to pay to save a few lives.

But exploring a forest should be perfectly fine with lynx about, they're mainly nocturnal and will only harm humans if they're perceived to threaten their young (like most animals). I'd generally be more worried walking through a field of cows frankly; cows can be vicious, even more so if they have calves. And on the topic of livestock losses, lynx will prey upon sheep as far as I'm aware, but the numbers would be so low I'd think financial compensation would be sufficient.

Clearly we differ on our view of how we connect to nature here, but in my view, large mammals especially get people engaged in nature. Animals like tigers, pandas, and polar bears are all cared about far more by the general public than many others and really raise awareness about conservation efforts across the board. And I really think that raising awareness amongst an increasingly urbanised population is important. Some youngsters hardly know where their food comes from, let alone what the rest of the countryside and their environment is like! If reintroducing species like the lynx in a hope to make them into figureheads can bring people to further understand how the natural world benefits them, or just get them interested in it... Hell, I think it's worth it!

We are, basically, the walking definition of white male privilege. 

So when you say ""sexism is fixed"", you are talking from the perspective of somebody who *has never faced sexism*. Worse, you're pointing to the state of the law as evidence for this. 

If a middle aged, rich white American politician in the 1970's said ""We banned segregation, so racism is fixed!"" we'd view that as a pathetically ignorant suggestion. Can you see the equivalence here?

Now, I sympathise, I really do. I thought we were, as a society, over sexism. Like you, I just can't understand *how anyone can be sexist*: it's so blindingly obvious that everyone should be treated equally. But my view of how far we'd progressed was entirely shattered by speaking to female friends, and finding out how completely prevalent it is for them to be discriminated against, groped, verbally abused and sexually assaulted in the UK, in 2015.

We are *not* over sexism. Women are still being discriminated against, often seemingly unconsciously. Something which shocked me recently was that this is the case even in academia, where you'd expect people to be the most forward thinking, for example:

And specifically the UK: [Female academics face huge sexist bias – no wonder there are so few of them](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/feb/13/female-academics-huge-sexist-bias-students)

&gt;Unless you want to force women to study STEM I don't really know what you expect to be done? You are just assuming that women are making the 'wrong' decision when they express their desire to study a non-STEM subject, maybe we should just leave that up to the individual?

No, we shouldn't force anyone, you're quite right. But we can't stick our heads in the sand and say ""It's fixed, maybe women just don't want to do science?"". That's surely treating a symptom as a cause. Instead we need to ask, *why don't women want to do science?* And I doubt you'll get the answer by talking to men.

You seem to be confused yourself. There are 4 *denominations* of Islam, but only Sunni and Shia have different schools.

But I'll assume you mean Sunni, so my answer is Hanafi.

&gt;Demonstrate your understanding of the topic please. 

The rest of your questions are pointless, and a fallacy.

Just because I don't know the inner details of Nazi race/ethnicity theory, doesn't mean I can't say that I hate nazism and nazism is wrong.

You can't either, and yet you'd agree with me.

I do **not** need to know the details of something to point out when it is fundamentally wrong.

&gt;Which religious group out of all the groups in the world suffer the most from ISIS do you think?

Absolutely Muslims in both cases.

As I said, I have no problem with *muslims*! They are victims of Islam, like everyone else.

&gt;Which religious group kills the most ISIS fighters?

No religious group kills Islamic State fighters. Militaries do. The ones right on ISIS's doorstep, of course, and *heavily* subsidised and supported by the west. But as an avid military analyst I can tell you they're doing a *piss poor* job at it, and each country in the region only started to respond when they themselves were affected.

For instance the logical, sensible and selective immigration that addresses real skill shortages in this country would be through the route of more liberal entry clearances through the higher education system.  

Yet the first targets of the Tories on immigration were foreign students coming here to study, particularly students outside the EU. When 2/3rds of immigration is coming from *inside* Europe, and you remove the option of  a Post Study work visa for everyone else, that sends the opposite message and you're only addressing part of the problem, and for very clear reasons of ticking a checkbox on a rhetorical target like 'tens of thousands'. 

Now, are there issues with bogus universities and colleges? Yes, of course. But that is due to a lack of oversight and regulation *within* the UK, and not the fault of a talented potential skilled worker, and a future tax payer (who is ineligible to public funds if they're from outside the EU, so no drain) looking to get a degree/job here. Is there abuse within that framework and will bogus students apply? Maybe, but there's abuse in every form of immigration. The regulation and oversight is where we deal with it. Not reducing government staff and packing in systems of immigration every 5 years.

This is correct.  Pedestrians have a permanent right of way at zebra crossings.  They should not have to wait ever.  But in practice most people don't understand this and pedestrians don't want to be injured by cagers so they end up having to wait.

It's actually one of the few times that a right of way actually exists on the highways.  On regular roads there is no right of way at all.  The roads are generally just a de facto right of way.  The other real rights of way are public footpaths, bridleways and byways (the latter are the only real rights of way for motorised vehicles, they are quite rare).

I can understand that sentiment, but Liverpool as a club should be more attractive than Rodgers as a person; lets be fair, Sanchez was attracted to playing for Arsenal over Liverpool, not Wenger over Rodgers.

I think that Klopp this season has shown that even good, maybe great managers, can have terrible seasons.

A more realistic analysis would realise that it's taken an annual increase of 10% in upstream spend every year over the last decade just to keep oil production constant, which thanks to the recent overproduction by the shale boys is no longer viable, leading to a likely oil shock in 2-3 years.  Also, a large portion of the world suddenly transitioning to electric cars would probably have a pretty significant effect on oil prices generally, leading to all sorts of instability.

Next, there's the assumption that very large amounts of wind can just arbitrarily be added into the grid without impacting cost or stability.  Grid stability (both frequency and supply) at high levels of wind penetration is not guaranteed, and is not a well understood problem at the momen.  Economic feedbacks could also add extra instability.  Adding in large amounts of EV's, which can add significant extra strain if charging rapidly is yet another issue, as a lot of the domestic grid might need rewiring.  They do at least have the price of electricity doubling, but then whether or not they include this feeding back into whether or not people could afford more electric cars, which really aren't all that cheap.

Other factors ignored include a likely explosion in the cost of producing lithium to produce it in the required quantities (assuming global transition toward EV's) and the fact that a hydrogen economy on any scale is basically a luricrous proposition.  There's no whole system level thinking or analysis at all, just a neat little silo.

I mean, look, we need to get off oil and coal, this is true.  But they also represent fuels which, in terms of energy density, are basically magic.  Any study which finds that somehow transitioning away from these highly energy dense stocks of fuels to diffuse intermittent sources, while at the same time changing the makeup of our entire vehicle fleet, rolling out new charging infrastructure, dealing with things like resource depletion and climate change along the way, doing all that and it somehow ends up being cheaper than our current highly efficient and highly stable energy supply system, well it's horse shit.  But then economists don't have a clue about energy, so no big surprise.",null,0,null,1426006398,null,0,1426007497,0,cpaeehs,null,t3_2yk3kg,null,t1_cpaeehs,null,t3_2yk3kg,null,null,null,1427682623,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

Edit: in seriousness, entertaining content falls under the third bullet point, more detail in page 4 of the file you linked.  
&gt; What the BBC will do to achieve this Purpose

&gt; 1. Provide output that is distinctive and creative on all its platforms.
&gt; BBC output should be distinctive. The BBC should regularly include output that
&gt; breaks new ground, develops fresh approaches, sets trends, and takes creative
&gt; risks, from drama and comedy to entertainment and sport. It should do this
&gt; across all the platforms on which it operates.
&gt; 2. Ensure enrichment for all audiences by covering a wide range of creative and
&gt; cultural activities.
&gt; The BBC should offer its audiences the best examples of many kinds of creative
&gt; activity including music and sport, always striving to expand horizons and
&gt; encourage audiences into unfamiliar territory, including minority sports.
&gt; 3. Encourage active participation in cultural activities.
&gt; The BBC’s programming should stimulate people to take part in a wide range of
&gt; cultural and sporting events and activities. Partnerships with other organisations
&gt; will often help in achieving this.
&gt; 4. Provide a wide range of enjoyable and entertaining content.
&gt; Entertainment should remain a key priority for the BBC. BBC output should
&gt; entertain, in the sense of engaging, absorbing, challenging or delighting
&gt; audiences in ways that demonstrate creative excellence.
&gt; 5. Foster creativity and nurture and support UK talent across a wide range of genres.
&gt; The BBC should nurture UK talent by introducing new production, writing and onair
&gt; talent to audiences. The BBC should also aim to bring the best talent to its
&gt; audiences from across the UK’s creative community. ",null,0,null,1426007033,null,0,1426007350,0,cpaetmr,null,t3_2yko2a,null,t1_cpaetmr,null,t1_cpaenm3,null,null,null,1427682819,null,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12,null

As I mentioned at the top; they're masters of marketing, and have a reasonable track record.

Is Woodford's track record at Invesco repeatable? He has a much smaller team of analysts and less institutional support. Does this matter? Who knows? Did he just make a few lucky calls over the years or is he truly one of the few who can stock pick in advance?

Okay, this is where you're full of shit. You don't appreciate the schools you just wikipediad then. Al-Queda base their killing of civilians on an 800 year old fatwa that allows Muslims to kill the slaves of the mongols that pulled the siege engines in the siege of Baghdad.  

Now, follow me. Hanbali are the literalist fucks that no-one ever liked (seriously, they got kicked out of cities for being pricks). That's the school that Saudi Arabia follows and the school that influenced the splinter of Wahhabism that the Saudi's like to spread (aka where lots of petrodollars went and why its more widespread than it once was). Wahhabism is ""the reformation"" of Islam that tries opposes all of the other schools, calls Shia heretics and wants to return to the most literal, basic and ancient form of Islam. Now from them we have the group Al-Queda who are into Wahabbism but don't represent the whole lot. NOW one founding theologian (Aimen Dean) of Al-Queda disagrees with their interpretation of that fatwa that lets them kill civilians.  

So with that in mind, the subset of the subset of the subset still had someone in it that disagrees with their religious thinking. AND YOU STILL WANT TO PAINT ALL OF ISLAM AS SUPPORTING WHAT THEY DO.

null,false,PyschoCandy,null,null,null,"&gt; I dont want to debate possible short term economic benefits of having a higher population, because let's face it that's not the reason people support it. 

Actually this is a key point.  Our economy would be much worse off without immigration

&gt; Nobody is sat at home thinking, this area is shit, wages are low, housing is short, government is crap... What would make it better? Immigrants!  Nobody is thinking that, because its bollocks.  

No.. because that's a terrible, terrible logic and conflation of issues that have little to do with each other.  Immigration has negligible impact on low income earners (something like £5 a week) and actually increases income for mid/high income earners.  As for area being shit, not sure how immigrants coming is would impact...  And Gov being shit most immigrants vote left leaning (even if orthodox religious, which is more conservative you would think) due to the anti-immigration rhetoric from the right.  That said, most EU immigrants do not get UK citizenship and vote anways...


&gt; 
&gt; It just seems to me that most people on the left who support illogical levels of immigration, doesnt matter what quality of immigrant, whether they are rich, poor, skilled or unskilled... They just support immigration... It seems these people support it simply because people on the right don't support it.
&gt; 
&gt; If we were been logical both sides would say... We need sensible and selective immigration that addresses real skilla shortages.  We dont need a million unskilled workers stretching our public services.

Open borders and free movement of people/services is a conservative idea

yes, some logic and sence would be nice in the debate, instead we have UKIP and fear-mongering from the right.  

We have very low unemployment.  The immigrants are key to many of our key sectors.  EU immigrants are proven to improve economy, and give more than they take (along with being less likely to take benefits).  

We can all agree we need more/better public services.   The key is left leaning people will vote for a party that tries to address these issues, rather than scapegoate immigrants or defund services based on political ideology.  Further, I have yet to hear anyone from the right explain what they would cut from the budget without the immigrants boosting our economy, indeed they are promising even more to the key recipient group instead (pensioners)

Alternatively because they have been trained, by society, to value having a family over professional development. Just as we have been trained by society to value professional development over being stay at home fathers. 

I think you're under-playing the role of society in shaping who we are and how we think. If society was gender blind, females who wanted a career would seek it, and seek husbands who wanted to stay at home and look after the kids.

This is why I think you're being absurd by suggesting that sexism is gone.

However, I do want to warn anyone who goes to their NHS doctor about acne NOT to accept antibiotic treatment. It may seem like a good idea, considering how horrible having acne is, but after taking oxytetracycline for years on my doctor's recommendation, I have later found out that prolonged antibiotic use can give you IBS by killing all the good bacteria in your gut. If I had known this at the time I would never have accepted the treatment. I don't know if doctors still carry out this practice (given that antibiotic resistance is also a concern), but if anyone does get offered antibiotics I strongly recommend you say no and ask for other options.

No, you've missed a key word in my question. My question is ""why don't women *want* to do science?"" not ""why don't women do science"", I've shifted the focus to women as agents. 

&gt;Yes, there is sexism in male-dominated workplaces, but to me that seems more like a symptom than the cause.

So sexism exists, which /u/alexgmcm denied.

&gt;Do you believe that sexual discrimination is the cause of fewer women choosing to study STEM subjects?

No. I think gender roles are the likely culprit. 

&gt;If so, whose discrimination is causing the problem? I'm pretty sure there's no discrimination in University admissions procedures. Is it teachers? Parents? Somebody else?

You're confusing active, overt discrimination with the creeping influence of gender roles. People don't have to be actively discriminated against in order to be discouraged from doing something.

&gt;Unless you're at least trying to answer this question, I can't see how you're helping.

Perhaps looking at my comments in context: /u/alexgmcm denied sexism exists. I found that suggestion laughable and tried to convince him otherwise. I'm not trying to come up with an answer as to how to encourage women to get into STEM. By my own convictions *I can't provide that answer* because I am a man with STEM qualifications!

If they care about their funding and what their viewers actually think they wouldn't get rid of him unless he's done something totally out of order. 

&gt;I think it's unfair to say the BBC's obsessed with political correctness

They absolutely are. This is the organisation that has a women quota for their panel shows. They must have a female even if that means more deserving men are overlooked. On a recent Question Time they refused to put one parties male candidate on the show because they wanted a second woman, this is how ludicrous they are. 

&gt;It totally removes the context that they're constantly under fire from papers with political sway

This clarkson issue is totally separate from their political biases. It's only political in the sense of political correctness, not party political bias. 

&gt;They can't do anything right - if they broadcast something offensive they get battered

Of course much of the media is out to get them and some would say that's entirely expected. The BBC has a massive advantage in competition because they're state funded and the other broadcasters want to take them down a peg or two. 

The problem is how the BBC react to these non-controversies. They always give them credence by reacting, they warn Clarkson over total non-issues when they should just ignore it. They're state funded so they don't have to pander to the same interests as other broadcasters yet they always do.

If the lynx can climb and access nests from a species which is used to that safe haven. Or I guess for farmers the worries that some species of lynx can attack deer so if herds are at risk. But I'm just speculating. 

Think in the UK development or farming prevents some speicies from moving or being more wide spread as prey in countries where the lynx is still wild. But maybe the lynx won't breed and stay in small numbers in the UK this might not be an issue, from what I've tried to read up on it's tricky to know for sure the impact. 

&gt;The Eurasian lynx is mainly active around dawn and dusk, but may actively hunt during any hour of the day (8). The bulk of its diet is comprised of mammalian herbivores such as roe and red deer. Wild pigs, beavers, hares, rabbits, small rodents, other carnivores and birds are also taken when larger animals are scarce (1) (2) (4) (8). A proficient hunter, the Eurasian lynx is capable of killing animals three to four times its own size (2) (4) (6). Prey is usually approached by stealth, until close enough to pounce on, or pursue over a short distance, but sometimes it will ambush potential quarry by lying in wait near trails (4). One of the widest ranging of all cat species, the Eurasian lynx has a broad distribution stretching from western Europe through Russia and down into Central Asia (1) (4) (6). This overall range is occupied by around seven separate subspecies but there is yet to be a final agreement on their classification (7) (8). While populations from Scandinavia to Central Asia are largely intact, the Eurasian lynx has been extirpated from large parts of western and central Europe, and southwest Asia, with generally only small, widely separated populations remaining",null,0,null,1426010348,null,0,false,0,cpah0fq,null,t3_2yjoee,null,t1_cpah0fq,null,t1_cpagi68,null,null,null,1427683841,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

here's to hoping i'm wrong though, i love the kid and think he's been a great addition. but if we revert back to 4 at the back, i see flanno at lb and the new rb we buy as a starter. i think moreno will get moved further up the pitch because he is just too strong of an attacking outlet to keep bundled in the back, for now. he's also not entirely disciplined enough for that, whereas flanno stays true to the cause. on top of that, i don't know how connor randall fits into the picture, but it's pretty clear to me mclaughlin has no future and brad smith is as good as gone this summer...so we'll see what's good with this summer, but those are my honest feelings on how the club are leaning.

just looked it up, we have never beaten swansea in wales. we tied them 2-2 last year, 1-1 the year before, 0-0 in 12/13 and lost 1-0 in 11/12. going to be a tough match, and gary monk has been a revelation there. i love the swans style of play. outside of liverpool, the only two other teams i enjoy watching casually are southampton and swansea. arsenal is appealing to the eye as well, but they can be cunt bags too. i am hoping for a recharged, refreshed team that puts their shooting boots on. This game literally has no room for a draw, let alone a loss. we don't need to keep pace, we need to set the pace. we have a huge opportunity to gain points on someone this weekend: 

- mufc play spurs. a draw is the most favorable result for us because we can gain points on both, but honestly would love a united loss as well. 

- arsenal play west ham. whfc is always a tricky game for teams like us, arsenal because they play so aerially and both teams aren't brimming with physical bruisers like the hammers do. 

- saints play chelsea and a chelsea win would effectively, in my mind, take the wind out of the saints sails. the flip side, if saints get a W, spurs and mufc draw and arsenal draw/lose...well we could possibly be looking up the table and thinking to ourselves...""shit, if we keep going, we could win the league""...but at the end of the day, focus on ourselves, do our work and get a win at all costs.

Basically, private companies can only really invoice* you for their losses which are minimal. Their charges are not genuine pre-estimate of loss and their signs are usually inadequate.

Don't be scared or threatened into paying, their entire business model is based around fear. If you've already gone past the discount stage then you have nothing to lose by fighting this all the way to POPLA (independent appeals service) or court. As far as court goes, costs if you lose are very limited in small cases such as this would be, so again don't be scared by any threats of massive court costs.

Debt collections agencies aren't any special people either, it's just another company that will write you letters.

Take a look at the link above, plenty of similar cases (find one for the same company that is invoicing you) and post your own if you like.

Marko can also play striker. so that leaves flanno and moreno right now. we still need a rb, someone in the mould of clyne or even a danilo. BR absolutely does not see ibe, marko or sterling as wingbacks long term and clyne would be a great pick up. I think we keep enrique as back up to moreno (who seems to be in great condition fitness wise). flanno to back up/compete for starting spot with whoever we buy (and maybe that play is manquillo!). i also do not agree, i think 3-4-2-1 is a great system and has been working for us...but i think once we get a few more pieces, we will be more deadly playing in a 4-3-3, 4-1-3-2 or 4-3-2-1 (all essentially same thing, just some minor tweaks). we have all of the cbs we need and i cannot justify spending more money on cbs when we've spent upwards of 45m on them in the past 2 season (sahko, ilori and lovren). this gives us depth in sahko, skrtel, lovren, ilori, and kolo (for 2 starting spots) and wisdom is coming back and could play rb/cb. if we do sell enrique then i see flanno as the competing lb with moreno, and i see wisdom + new signing competing on the right. 

in the center of the park, we only have allen and hendo as guaranteed to be here for next season. hendo will definitely sign a new contract when the season ends and is a big part of the squad (much to the chagrin of most of the fans on this sub). we have teixeira coming back, alberto (who i think could make it as a deep lying playmaker a la xabi alonso), coutinho, lallana and rossiter and williams who are all in the mix for cm. i see sterlings long term in cam position, i see ibe long term as a striker/second striker/winger. i think we will probably also be in the market, but not necessarily hurting for, another gk. and finally, i think aspas, borini, balotelli/lambert and yesil will all be shipped out this summer. im not sure if br truly doesn't like balotelli, if he doesn't, he's gone. if he does and has been just adjusting him to our style, lambert is gone. that would leave us with sturridge, origi, lambert/balo and the possible need for another striker. that player could be sinclair, that player could be ibe, it could be marko. who knows, but i think there is going to be a semi major clear out of dead wood this summer. a lot of youth players who won't make it: brad smith, mclaughlin, dunn, kevin stewart, lussey, yesil...then you throw on senior players who are possible shouts for leaving/they are leaving: stevie, lucas, lambert, enrique, alberto, aspas, borini, manq...so anyways i think we have the solid, young core that BR was looking for and now he's going to build around raheem, ibe, allen, moreno, sahko, hendo and coutinho. sturridge is too brittle to build around, but he is a game changer. anyways a bit of a rant but those are my 50 cents lol",null,0,null,1426013835,null,0,false,0,cpajcc7,null,t3_2yjs45,null,t1_cpajcc7,null,t1_cpadod3,null,null,null,1427684928,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

This is because of the way a government loans money: they sell bonds at various rates for a fixed period - a promise to pay at a certain date with a certain interest.

Hence, many funds that are set up to be used 40 or 50 years down the line (such as pensions) have a large chunk of government debt.

Klopp: not a very good season from him, has proven credentials including the Champions League but I don't think he'd leave Dortmund. 

Ancelotti: Proven all round and one of the best in the world in my opinion, but he's hardly a long term option. Even if things went the best possible route we'd likely be looking for a new manager within the decade. Also his last clubs have practically given a blank cheque to sign whoever he wants, not quite in line with the build from youth policy of FSG. 

While I respect your opinion, I cannot see why we would chop and change managers when that is what leads to mediocrity. Every few seasons a new name, new players, money going out the window. It's like throwing shit at the wall and hoping something sticks.

Stability and a long term strategy is the key to build a great team when you don't have the billions of oil or gas moguls.

You really think so? I'm finding this series incredibly over produced.
They keep doing all these weird effects shots of fancy cars surrounded by smoke and fire and flames and water and explosions and stuff like that, moreso than ever before, and the 'challenges' are just getting ludicrous.

The ambulance one, for example. Where the hell did all those decals and professional paintwork on Richard's one come from? What about all that pro-level welding work on Jeremy's raisable scoop thing? He certainly didn't do that, and how stupid would you have to be to believe that James' ""remote controlled stretcher"" thing was real? There was obviously no motor driving the wheels, it was apparently capable of robotically navigating by itself, and the control box was the fakest thing I've ever seen. It was a stretcher, being pulled by a string.

And sure, you might say, well, that bit is obviously a joke, but more and more and more of the show is like that. At this point there doesn't seem to be much left which isn't pre-scriped or done with effects and trickery for a gag.

A lot of the stuff they present as them doing on public streets or around people, there's no way they'd be allowed to do for real with the way they'd be endangering pedestrians and other drivers. They've obviously closed off streets and got in extras to act as pedestrians, but they present it as if it's real, off the cuff, and unscripted.

I like Top Gear, but I'm really getting a jumped the shark vibe from this series.

So the only real driving force here is to simplify job searching for low level roles? I can understand the thinking but *very* hard to police effectively. 

&gt; There's also nothing stopping companies from listing the same job twice if they want to take either a complete newbie or someone with experience.

Besides duplicated effort, there'd also be a lot of confusion amongst applicants as well.

Are they recruiting for multiple positions? Well now I'm confused.

**First of all**, Paulinho, Chiriches, Erisen all have quality enough to play in a top league. Maybe not at Spurs, but nonetheless they are quality.  Khumalo is a fine player, but it is obvious to all he doesn't cut it at the top level. He will do well in the Championship or the middle leagues of Europe.

**Secondly**, the European and Brazilian market is **already saturated**. 90% of young men have already decided what team they support. We will gain a few fans here and there by signing players, but it is not like Danish Arsenal fans will become Spurs fans because we signed Eriksen.

Sub-Saharan Africa and the U.S. on the other hand is an **untapped market**. There are millions of fans just waiting for a reason to follow a specific team (or to sign up with a particular satellite package). In Khumalo's case we get exposure in South Africa, but importantly, we also get a working relationship with the company that controls what games to show, when to show them, and so forth in a market that counts half a billion people.

null,false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"I suspect this isn't the answer anyone wants, but I don't think as things stand that prosecutions are possible. The reasons for this are complicated, but I'll try to address some of the bigger ones:

A. Complexity:

Often the principles behind an avoidance device are extremely simple. Take the Working Wheels scheme, for instance: You decide the amount of the losses you want. You sign a few papers that say we entered into a business agreement and you incurred expenses of about two and a half times the tax you want to avoid. You tell HMRC you made losses trading and now you don't have to pay tax. That really is how that works. *(Actually the Tax Tribunal decided it didn't work, but that was the scheme.)* In the real world though you wrap all this in extra layers of obfuscation.

Off the top of my head I don't recall if it was a UK or US case, but there was a bank prosecution where it was noted that responsibility was so diffuse and the processes so complex there was no real hope of a conviction.

Part of the issue here is that the jury system isn't fit to address the sort of complexity we're talking about. On top of that, there's the bias issue. I shouldn't be found guilty because my jury is full of people who loathe me for having wealth and avoiding tax, if the facts don't support it. Nor should I get away with it if I have the good fortune to have a jury with people who believe avoidance is always legal.

B. Opportunity cost:

Users of an avoidance scheme will accept that it failed more readily if a lighter touch approach is taken. If prosecution were a possibility they'd be imprisoned they'd fight tooth and nail to the end. The same principle applies to a bank. The chief executive of a bank may roll over and accept a fine and a telling off. Prosecution will be fought to the last.

So, potentially **in terms of recovery per case** light touch regulation recovers more for less. In my opinion, where this fails is that so few cases can be be handled. The American model is also self assessment, but if you get caught taking liberties they will throw the book at you. A spot-check based system can really only work if there is a strong incentive to play nice.

A balance between the extremes is needed, but you have to accept that in the cases where you make an example of someone you'll get less and it'll take longer.

C. ""I'm arresting you because, ummmm...""

In some circumstances the distinction between avoidance and evasion is extremely slim. I'm certainly open to the argument that HMRC doesn't push this argument. *(Bear in mind what I said above about recovery against time and effort though.)*

When it comes to something like a bank facilitating shady deals and in particular a foreign national in a foreign subsidiary, I don't think there's grounds for prosecution. Who would we prosecute? A guy in Switzerland who has never set foot in the UK? A UK director who we can't show knew about any particular deal? We don't prosecute wire fraud the way America does, nor I think can we prosecute for oversight failure, even if it was essentially turning a blind eye.

D. Resource and regulatory capture:

Neither HMRC nor the Court system could bear the weight of the scale of the prosecutions I suspect the public would like to see.

The thing is, a large part of the public are the very people baying for HMRC, the police, the court service, more or less the entire public sector to have their pay and numbers culled. We're getting the service we're willing to pay for. It's often not very good, but that's because we've decided to buy the store brand version of a tax system with a side order of contempt.

HMRC's top people aren't for the most part tax professionals *(off the top of my head, I think Jim Harra is the sole executive HMRC has with a tax background)* so what hope do you suppose they have of getting things right when they're being wined and dined by big businesses, keen to tell them how reasonable they've been?

At the time Vodafone was daily news one of the newspapers described Dave Hartnett's decision to change the investigators on case as something close to, *'the investigators, very clever men with a black and white view were replaced by men with a much more flexible interpretation to the facts.'

Finally, while an HMRC executive might be handsomely remunerated, the people doing the highest level technical work are paid far less than their counterparts. The argument for huge bonuses for top bankers was that without them they couldn't retain the right staff. If you won't pay for Morse, maybe you get a PCSO who tells off four year olds for cycling on the pavement.

Ok, so we're screwed. How could it be fixed?

Firstly, forget about prosecution. The criminal evidence standard is beyond reasonable doubt. The civil standard is a balance of probabilities.

Isn't that a bit soft though? Well, in a civil regime you can impose fines. Harsh fines. Whenever the banks are fined (and some of the fines are huge) they're never more than the benefit the bank gained. The fines need to scale to demolish the financial benefit.

Make the Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes register a public record. No public disclosure? Ok, no tax deduction. This would allow people to see the shenanigans. It wouldn't deter everyone, but note that the DJ who used the Working Wheels scheme asked for it to be kept private, because a public decision could harm his career. *(The Tribunal told him to sling his hook on that one.)*

Resource HMRC and the courts properly. In the case of HMRC make the rewards heavily performance based and subject to potential claw-backs.

Adopt an IRS style, Draconian regime where deliberate 'errors' are concerned.

Some feminists argue that this is because of discrimination against women and the ""[presumption of male competence](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-4537.00106/abstract)"".

null,false,seamushoo4,lfc68,,null,"yeah exactly. i think ibe might actually do good on himself to get one more year in the rwb role if we don't find the right player, at the right price because it will give him more experience and expand his footballing knowledge (primarily how to work hard on both attack and defense and also how to work off of the ball and see the perspective of the field). anyways i truly think we would be well served putting in a 15-25m for someone like clyne or danilo. i also think it would be wise to put in 15-25m for a cm. outside of that, i think priorities are gk (migs earned his starting spot for me, but we do need another back up who will push him, unless BR thinks danny ward is ready) and then striker. striker is the least important to me b/c we have so may on our books and lambert, balotelli, origi, borini, aspas and sturridge can all get a job done, i think they've all been hit with a bit of a scoring bug and lost some of their magic. we also have sinclair. Finally, i think we should go all out to sign milner. he's 29, experienced, a winner and has a work rate comparable to hendo. we have been extremely fortunate to have not lost hendo to injury much throughout his career, and i know he'll take injections to play through knocks, but at the end of the day, it's all about preserving him as much as we can for bigger matches, and extending his career. adding someone like milner makes it easier to sit hendo when he's picked up slight knocks and not downgrading in quality. milner also is equally as versatile and can play striker, lb, rb, lwb, rwb, rm, lm cm, and probably even cb if it was asked of him. he is an absolute no brainer to me and before we spend any money this summer, we should move a fucking mountain to sign him on a free. 

my final bit on this whole thing is to summarize what i think we should do this summer, looking at our squad, and analyzing where we have biggest gaps...this list is ordered to how i would prioritize summer business: 

1. milner - free- move a fucking mountain to sign this guy. perfect stop gap for gerrard leaving, and if we buy a young guy for between 15-20m who has a lot of potential, it takes the onus off of him to perform immediately because we have a ready made replacement in milner who is obviously not stevie g, but not a bad second choice. 

2. sign a rb, in the mould of clyne or danilo - 15-25m - i would say this is probably our most important signing of the summer. we need a right footed moreno as you stated, it's essential. flanno is great, but you're right probably a back up in the grand scheme of things but definitely a guy who's got a big of jamie in him and won't give up. you need players like that in the squad, but in a technical, fluid set up, you also need full backs who are capable of playing winger. that's how technical they need to be. de sciglio or cancelo are two that i have heard a lot about, de sciglio in particular. i don't know if they're our guys, but there are gems all over italy and spain that are going for moreno money. hell why not go for seamus coleman? especially if everton get relegated...

3. sign a cm - 15-25m - yes we just signed milner in this scenario above, but milner is a stop gap. 2-3 years. sign a young, potetial packed cm and develop him. start blooding him into the side and get him game time in the region of 15-20 matches. ruben neves is one we've been linked with, same with saul niguez from sevilla. carvalho is too much money for. pogba? too much money as well. 

4. sign a gk - 3-7m - i've seen the name neto tossed around pretty loosely. i don't know that we can get many keepers for a good price, who are all that great...but if we could get a petr cech or possibly even a brad friedel type. someone who is older, can do a job, but not expected to play too many games. mignolet earned his spot for me, just find him someone who will push him farther. 

5. finally, the last piece (if it's even necessary) - st - 5-15m...the guy i would want the most if we had the pick of the litter is vietto...dude is so ",null,0,null,1426016748,null,0,false,0,cpalafs,null,t3_2yjs45,null,t1_cpalafs,null,t1_cpahuqv,null,null,null,1427685837,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

Since they have to pay that extra £100bn somehow (and just printing 2 billion new £50 notes is probably not a good idea), they have to borrow it, increasing the national *debt* by £100bn.

Each year, the debt is increased by the amount of the deficit. If we reduce the deficit (either by increasing revenues or by cutting spending), we reduce the rate that the debt grows. A high deficit means that the debt gets bigger faster.

null,false,OhHiGCHQ,scot-Lothian,Lothian,null,"And what percentage of parents have internet monitoring software on their kid's computers, phones and tablets, let alone ones that their kids can't circumvent.

It's all very well to go ""Oh, it's their fault and their fault alone for not monitoring their children's internet access"", especially after the fact but the thing is that very few parents use child lock software or spend their time looking over their kids shoulders at everything they do. The parents were certainly naive (that or the girls cobbled together one very clever excuse) to some extent when one of the girls said she was going to a Wedding but I doubt the parents knew what was going on. Very few parents have child lock software and with the portability of smartphones and tablets they could easily have been radicalised and indoctrinated into the IS cult behind the closed door of their rooms.

I don't accept that it's 100% the parents fault, to me it's like turning around to a parent of a kid who's just been stabbed and saying [""it's your fault for not putting a stab proof vest on him"".](https://vimeo.com/70245926) Most parents don't constantly monitor their kids internet use especially when their kid hasn't done anything wrong on the internet before, so I don't see the point in pointing the finger at the parents for not doing something most parents do anyway. They obviously didn't know what was happening.

I have sympathy with the families, they've lost their kids to a cult. It's obvious the kids went to some lengths to hide what they were doing and I doubt the parents had any idea what was happening. That's the thing with cults, they inspire behavior like this and they make sure they separate people from their families who would challenge the cult's doctrine. I don't know what, if anything, the Police or security services knew. If they knew what was going on, that this babyfucker of a Woman was in contact with these girls and indoctrinating them, then I believe they should have chapped on the door and said ""Hey, are you the parents of these girls? They've been in contact with an ISIS recruiter, I think we should talk with them together.""
