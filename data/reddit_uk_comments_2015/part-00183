I think Owen specifically meant that Milibandism's opinions on _immigration_ and _trade unions_ were to the right of Blairism's.  And you can see why this has happened, if not necessarily agreeing—UKIP have set the agenda on immigration, and the right-wing media constantly hammered Ed for being the ‘union man’ ever since their vote edged him into the lead on the leadership contest.

I think it's important to remember that we haven't missed a lot of top players do to money, it's been down to not being as attractive as the truly top clubs in the world. This is both reassuring and sad, unfortunately. 

Still, the positive is that, if we hadn't repeatedly tripped over our dicks this year, we would be in the CL again even with this squad, which is rather devoid of talent when comparing it to the clubs above us. Personally, you hear a lot of ""this was the year to do it"" talk, and I think that's premature. There is no indication that the clubs above us will all the sudden all click and start runs of not dropping points. For the past few seasons we've seen a very competitive finish in spots 1-5. Even this year, where Chelsea ran away with the title a bit, lots of clubs were in the CL mix. This could be the new status quo. City, Arsenal and United all have top managers and top players.

One option I have suggested before is to scale up through the levels, and stop or even step back a level when you feel your skin has reached its tolerance.

&gt; My deep frustration is that this tilted the whole conversation about politics – the reporting, and therefore the pressure the reporting placed on the politicians. To be specific, if we had known how close the Liberal Democrats were coming to wipeout, there might have been speculation about what that would mean.

Because everyone assumed LDs would still be in coalition of some sort it's only now everyone's looked around and gone 'oh fuck, what have we done?'

&gt; Britain is brimming with relatively affluent (or at least comfortable) non-socialists who have a strong sense of community and social altruism. They support homelessness projects run by churches, they back local campaigns, they spend spare income not on bigger cars but on Oxfam appeals. They are good people. They just happen to be outside the immediate reach of the state. Labour can sometimes give the impression that only those working in the public sector or those on benefits are virtuous and admirable. This is politically lethal.

This describes a lot of people I see on social media, including here, where they demonise Tory supporters as selfish just because they don't believe the state is the best way to solve society's problems.

You have the number for customer services and i would advise that you contact them.  That being said it is the sender who has any compensation rights as if you think about it Royal mail is the shipping company and the person who paid for the service is the sender and therefor who is entitled to the compensation.

You would have to get compensated by the seller and then they would then have to receive their compensation from Royal Mail

The fact that it was placed in the bag is simply Royal mail policy that we would do with any damaged item, and this could have been applied at any point of the parcels journey.  It may have been that no one processing the item noticed it was damaged until it had reached the postman for delivery and then as soon as the damage was noticed the item was placed into the ""damaged item"" bag.

What i will say is that when stuff does get tampered with generally speaking people don't go to the effort of replacing the contents of the parcel as to be honest what it the point.  

They have already achieved what they wanted to by getting what was inside and then the packaging normally gets dumped as once the item is out of the packaging all they would do by keeping it would provide a to link the stolen item from the original packaging, by them keeping the packaging and then replacing the contents would do nothing but increase their chances of getting caught.

All the experience I have had through work sounds like the item has more than likely been ""tampered with"" by the seller as only they would realistically need to make the parcel seem like it contained what it was supposed to after not actually sending the requested product.

I don't think you'll be playing anymore games than this season, 2 semis, plenty of european games. When is Origi going to be ready if you don't give him experience in cups or europa league. There's also a lot of hypothetical situations for Origi to start week in week out and what's stopping Ings from being a transfer failure as well?

Ings isn't that young, he's 22, 23 in July. The players you've stated don't really apply. Centre mids and centre backs  get better with age, more experience means better decision making, better positioning etc. With Ings' playing style that's not going to happen, not by a significant enough margin to make him any better than an Europa League player. There's so many football scouts nowadays, finding a gem is pretty much impossible and unless something spectacular happens, realistically Ings' potential is way lower than Origi.

Russia and Turkey are special cases. Russia in it's current state is quite oppressive and antagonistic. It has set itself up against the EU and NATO so I am unsurprised to see that it does not adhere to te western creation that is the ECHR. Turkey is unique in that it is a majority Muslim country in what is a predominantly Christian Europe. The ideological differences between the religions mean that Turkey likely has a greater margin of appreciation initially, but which will be tightened over time. We can see this in 'Sahin v Turkey'.

**Price of product:** £4.50 for 30ml

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because I miss the glow and light exfoliation of L-ascorbic acid but need a gentler product than the Active Formulas 15% CE ferulic. As little as 5% L-AA may be beneficial in rosacea.

(http://www.nature.com/jid/journal/v125/n4/full/5603565a.html)

**Your opinion:** Pleased to see such as unstable active protected by an airless pump bottle, tho I still refrigerate the product. I have been using this serum on alternate days only, applying a non acid vitamin C derivative in between.

The lotion consistency works really well for me, my skin does not dehydrate during the wait time. If my face is in good condition it tingles but on days it is irritated the serum does sting, so this seems to be plenty potent enough for my hypersensitive skin.

I definitely intend to repurchase and continue using on alternate days to minimise irritation, this price point is hard to beat!

For what it's worth, juries are fucking idiots. Jury members can be smart, but as a collective being, juries are a shit idea. Firstly, a person qualified in law should be making legal judgements and the judge , being far more clever than the layman, is perfectly suitable to make findings of fact. If he has an agenda (allegedly) there's the appeal process. That argument (that a single judge can be affected by an agenda) is irrelevant, however, because the public does have an agenda. It's largely pro-conviction influenced by the media who scaremonger. Judges are influenced solely by the law and the direction it should take. Juries are influenced by the suit the defence wears, the opinions of other jurors, the theatrics of the courtroom and the appearance of the accused. It's inherently unfair, but when you take a group of political animals and put them in a room to decide the fate of another, there's bound to be social phenomenons flying all around that room.

I would like add to what he has mentioned and talk about the quality of football Scotland produces.

When you watch La Liga, BPL, Bundesliga on tv are the pitches 80% mud? With more divots than a horse racing track? No they aren't. Football pitches have a much larger impact on the quality of football than most people realise. It hinders free flowing football when one touch passes are going all over the shop because of divots, it stop fast paced attacking or running with the ball and it prevents ground passes and we are stuck with a shit end result. Slow game, long balls. Less jaw dropping highlight goals, counter attacks etc etc.

I also genuinely believe some of the lower table clubs do it intentionally. Why would they do it intentionally? Well if your players are shit and cant string quick passes together or create free flowing counter attacks then you can simply stop your opponent not with any matter of skill, just make them play on marsh land and thats what we see week in week out in the SPFL. There has been a long history of play as much negative football as possible to scrape by, I'm looking at you St Mirren. St Mirren have been dross for years but hold on for death every year playing as negatively as possible hoping to hold onto a few points, get them to fuck.

It creates a high ball Scottish game witch is bad in every possible aspect for Scottish football, for competition in europe where high ball will get you skanted and raped on a big stage.

We need some serious quality pitch control, all natural and every club should be held to the same high standards, if you pitch is like a piece of shit after a curry then you deserve a massive fine every game for as long as it stays that way. The money would be ploughed into youth development and if you cant afford it, get to fuck because you wont want the cheque in 5 years time with some real TV money?

Yeah Mendes will definitely take some sort of fee or commission. Equally, I'm not really sure the Griezmann deal will really happen. And it's not that uncommon for players agents to be left in the dust when really they have very little knowledge of how to contact the people needed. Heck Mendes could just go there and ask Griezmann to drop his agent. His agent's company doesn't seem that impressive or with much clout.

null,false,tigernmas,,Monaghan,null,"I get where you're coming from and it does look a bit hopeless but last year something interesting happened in a place with some parallels with here. Ever since the balkan conflicts ended Bosnia and Herzegovina have been in a power-sharing arrangement similar to here. There are differences like the scale of the conflict and the fact that it is split three way but the results were quite similar. Total deadlock between opposing nationalisms.

Just like here the parties got nothing done arguing with one another and when it came to elections they stoked up tensions to get people to vote along tribal lines to keep the other out. But something clicked last year but got overshadowed by Ukraine. A mass uprising of people happened, initially in opposition to privatisation. The police were chased out of town and government buildings set on fire. People created popular assemblies and everyone had their say and the assemblies passed their demands and in the end the government resigned and some of the demands were met. It all sounds pretty crazy and not exactly what you want to see here but that's just how it worked out there. No one died or anything. The most significant part of it though was that it was completely cross community. It wasn't nationalist v nationalist v nationalist. It was people v the government and oligarchy of all stripes.

Those kind of economic struggles bring people together. We saw it here in [1907](https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/hadden/2007/05/belfast1907.htm), [1919](https://thegreatunrest.wordpress.com/2010/09/03/forgotten-history-the-belfast-engineering-strike-1919/) and [1932](http://libcom.org/history/1932-belfast-outdoor-relief-strike) on a large scale. Like can you even imagine a 12th of July march with republican bands playing with unionist ones? Or men of the Shankill rushing to the defence of Falls Road when the RUC moved in? You need to give people hope and something bigger than nationalism to unite over.

So with those things in mind take a look at what we've got today. Cuts are beginning and they're going to be nasty. We've had it down south. Austerity is a flawed concept and those services you lose will be gone for the foreseeable future. Those things are hard to win and very easy to cut. But in this NI has an opportunity to fight back against it. It might not happen immediately but once the effects sink in people will eventually crack. Once they do it gives us something big and independent to unite and fight for.

&gt;___W1A___ is a British comedy television series that was first broadcast on [BBC Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two) on 19 March 2014, created by [John Morton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Morton_(writer\)). The series is the follow-up to *[Twenty Twelve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Twelve)*, a [BAFTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA)-winning comedy series by the [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) about the [2012 Summer Olympics in London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics).   Its name comes from the postcode prefix of the BBC's headquarters, [Broadcasting House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_House) ([W1A 1AA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_postcode_area)),  and sees the reprisal of [Hugh Bonneville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Bonneville) and [Jessica Hynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Hynes) as their *Twenty Twelve* characters, alongside a new cast, with [David Tennant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tennant)'s role as narrator also continuing from the earlier series. The first series began on the 19 March, concluding on the 9 April 2014. A second series was announced later in 2014 which launched on 23 April 2015 with a one hour special.

&gt;After the demise of the Spice Girls, there was a good ten-year period or so where almost no British pop artists, good or bad, made it over here (to the US). The UK pop scene became this strange, isolated, parallel ecosystem, and everyone in America could pretty much go the rest of their lives without hearing of Girls Aloud, Ronan Keating, or, God forbid, Jedward.

&gt;The trade routes have reopened and the 2010s have seen all sorts of UK crossover hits. And it happened so gradually, I didn't even notice, but I guess this means I have to start paying attention to them too. Now this is, of course, an outsider's perspective on the British charts, but from what I can tell, reality shows run **everything**.

&gt;We've limited the damage that Simon Cowell has done to the pop charts (in the US). But a much larger proportion of England's biggest names in pop music came to prominence this way, including some they shipped over here.

We ""force"" kids to learn Welsh, apparently, and yet it is never said that we ""force"" kids to learn about English, Maths or Science - even when the methods used to encourage kids to learn are identical across subject areas.

Ultimately, Belfield's key argument has no grounding in reality. Examination statistics are published yearly by the Welsh Government and are available here:

http://gov.wales/statistics-and-research/examination-results/?lang=en

Below are the results for 2013/14, split according to medium. The figures given are percentages of all students (Welsh and English medium) who reach certain indicators of performance. For example, the Level 1 threshold is five GCSE passes of any grade. Level 2 is five good GCSE passes - grades A* - C. The Average Wider Points Score is an overall measure that considers all qualifications. 

Foo | Welsh Medium | English medium
---|---|----
Level 1 Threshold | 98% | 96%
Level 2 Threshold | 89% | 83%
Level 2 (incl. English/Welsh &amp; Maths) | 63% | 55%
Core Subject Indicator | 61% | 53%
Average Wider Points Score | 592 | 528
Average Wider Points Score (capped at 8 subjects) | 364 | 345

As you can see, Welsh medium wins on absolutely every indicator, so if anything, Welsh medium schools are dragging up the performance of the Welsh education system rather than bringing it down.

That is, however, an unfair comparison: on average, less kids in Welsh medium schools are on free school meals. Even when comparing like with like, however, Welsh medium schools tend to edge out their English medium counterparts. A full breakdown of examination results in schools by FSM entitlement and medium is available in [this Excel file](http://gov.wales/docs/statistics/2014/141126-key-stage-4-benchmarking-2014-ency.xlsx) (third tab).

Only in the very richest schools - those where 10% or less of the students are on free school meals - does English medium win. No doubt because of private schools like Ruthin School.

Right now they save a lot of money by restricting the service to UK IP addresses and hoping that anyone in the UK who is using it is hopefully a licence fee payer.

But to extend that to the entire EU would require them to get a list of every IP address used by every EU ISP, perform lots of network engineering to handle any new load created from non-UK users, and some sort of authentication to ensure that only licence fee payers can get on. (within the UK they connect directly to the ISPs, similar to the peering deals that have caused outrage in the US except the BBC doesn't pay for it)

They'd also have to pay for EU rights to music or content that currently they only pay for the UK/Ireland/Belgium/Netherlands (these are the countries that get the BBC officially)

&gt;__Robert Vaughn__ (born __Robert Vaughan__; June 5, 1836 — March 23, 1918) was a [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_American) immigrant to the United States and an important rancher, farmer, and businessman in the [U.S. state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state) of [Montana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana) before and after the early years of its statehood. He homesteaded the Vaughn ranch in the [Sun River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_River) valley in Montana, building a sandstone mansion as his home there. The town of [Vaughn, Montana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughn,_Montana), is named in his honor, and helped co-found the city of [Great Falls, Montana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Falls,_Montana). He built the [Arvon Block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvon_Block), a hotel and stable in Great Falls, one of the city's earliest buildings; the ranch and the hotel are both listed on the [National Register of Historic Places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places).

I've voted libdem the past three elections and thrown any spare council votes to the greens. I live in a tory safe seat so it's mainly pointless. After the election, I had the generic pub post-election moan, and scrolled through the endless facebook posts of people ushering in the end of the world now the tories had won. I realised I could join in the moaning as well, but I live inside a liberal filter bubble of mostly lefty types who just agree with me. Crap, I'm entering my 30s and when I was younger I assumed people my age thought like me and I figured we'd gradually get more liberal as a society as your stereotypical racist grandad generation died off. Then again, the baby boomers are retiring now and they were all supposed to be liberal right? summer of love and all that? But we still have a tory majority with X many million voting UKIP. So I was totally wrong and I just live inside my own microcosm. I can't be having that.

The only friend who I've had, who said to me last year that they would be voting UKIP, I promptly dismissed in our pub conversations as an 'utter retard' as he seriously thinks that the NHS is overwhelmed with health tourists. But that's the rub, I didn't have a rational conversation with him, I just instantly discarded him as an complete twazzock and went on my way. But it's useless to talk to people who agree with me in the same way that it's probably also useless to post in this subreddit, I should probably spend more time having conversations with people who do disagree with me without throwing my toys out of the pram.

I have no idea why I really joined, mainly I thought it might be a step in making some statement instead of just moaning ""bloody tories"" in the pub. After this intial ""fuck it i'll sign up"" I'm realistic about the amount of energy/motivation I'll be able to sustain in the coming years, but if I can convince just one right leaning voter over this side in a decent conversation I'll probably be happy.

Then during cup games, let him get time as DM or in Hendo's role. we need to slowly groom him into the midfield. He's ready as is, but we just have too many players who are better in the middle.

It's a CBeebies show that is so utterly *shite* it's on at the toddler graveyard slot, roughly 6am. 

Words cannot describe how utterly awful it is, but I'll try. The main character is a Scottish woman in her late 30s who's inexplicably called ""Granny Murray"", speaks with a weird 'lishp' which makes her sound like she's suffered some sort of brain injury, and spends her time gyrating around in a fashion reminiscent of a spastic undergoing convulsions. 

There's whole host of off-putting characters, including a woman taxi driver who looks like a man in drag, and a blind actor who never looks properly at the camera (you get the feeling the crew are to polite to tell him he's missing his mark). He's blind in real life. It's never mentioned if his character is. 

None of the cast can act beyond an amateur drama club level, and few can carry a tune. Of course, it's filled with off-key songs that range from mildly upsetting to embolism-inducingly bad. Even the theme tune gives me nightmares.

You also overestimate the power of the monarch. Yes she can appoint the PM, but the PM does have to be an MP sitting in the Commons. Royalty can't be MPs as they are nobility. So he'd have to renounce his titles and status first. Then he'd have to get elected in a constituency with the main parties throwing everything they've got in the campaign against him.

Then he's an MP. Grand-mumsy appoints him PM. But Commons is going to explode at him. He won't be able to form a government, and he'll be hounded out of the House before the end of Morning Prayers.

Next day a party leader becomes PM and begins a programme of limiting the monarchy's power even more, because she fucked with the House and they don't like when you do that.

null,false,SchrodingersMum,null,null,null,"Not only is it not a good idea, it's economically illiterate.

Workfare creates a situation where the person benefiting from the worker's labour (I will use Tesco as an example, but Tesco are by no means the only - or even the worst - culprit) doesn't pay for it.

Let's take the anti-shoplifting security mentioned in OP's example. This is a service that Tesco needs, and which Tesco benefits from. To use an economic term, it's a *demand*. And there are people able to provide this service - there is *supply*.

So, under fundamental economics, Tesco should be paying people to provide this service. This would benefit Tesco, because they have something they need, but it would also cost them money. This benefits the worker, because they are receiving payment, but it also costs them their labour. And it benefits the Government, because it brings in tax (there are also small costs to the Government, but they're more complicated)

So far, so obvious. But Workfare breaks this. Tesco now benefits from the service, but has no costs. The person on workfare puts in the same labour as the earlier mentioned worker, but receives much lower payment in return. And it costs the Government, not only in the money paid to the person on workfare, but they also lose out on tax revenue.

So Tesco is winning here, and everyone else is losing. But it goes further than that. It actively disincentives Tesco from hiring security, when they can just wait a while and eventually get it for free. This makes the problem worse for the Government, as it prevents people from going back into work (although, as [this FOI response from the ONS shows](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/business-transparency/freedom-of-information/what-can-i-request/previous-foi-requests/labour-market/work-programme/index.html), it does have a positive impact on employment figures), which costs the Government more money.

And all that is before we start looking at the effects it has on the people involved, and bigger questions concerning whether it breaches Article 4.

null,false,Jimmyjamjames,null,null,null,"Nice to see you making sweeping statements suggesting that I would ""i think it's fine to send them back"", think before you comment, where did I imply that. Now aside from your ability to run to conclusions let us examine the far better opportunities that this family could take. This would namely be in the form of the far greater opportunities that are presented on mainland Africa, lets take for example Ghana where it is evident that the mass economic growth in the country (spurred by Chinese investment) is a far more attractive long term opportunity than here in the UK where the ability for these people higher incomes through what will be their degrees will allow them to earn far more income then they would in the UK. By going to other countries in Africa they can escape the conflict, earn far more than in the UK and much less in terms of travel costs. (I apologise for the lack of spacing but my IPad seems to not like spacing) now for your second point, with things such as this you damned if you do something and damned if you don't. I would vouch for a non intervention approach because at the end of the day as evident with the rise of extremism since Blairs co-operation to invade Iraq becoming so heavily involved in acting as world police in this situation is bringing us little in benefit. I would argue we just leave the situation to America since they actually have the resources to undertake this operation, the money that we are sending to deal with this humanitarian crisis could be better spent here First, because why should we dump money into funding a war that will in no way benefit us. So as I said I would rather we just take a non intervention stance, otherwise if you are referring to its growth in the UK, we should just encourage members of ISIS to leave and just strip all their assets off them, and not allow them to return, (note this also applies to people who just go out to fight against ISIS).

null,false,dougie_g,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,null,"I have literally had people make the argument to me that leaving the EU would stop as many Muslims from coming to Britain.

Really, I think people want out of the EU because they don't understand it and think that it is to blame for a lot of stuff that it has nothing to do with. 

Yes, there are the people who moan about sovereignty, but 90% of people don't give a toss about that. They care that them or their family members can't get jobs, and blame Eastern European people for it rather than question why our economy is not distributed well enough for them to find a job. They blame it for crazy regulations that don't exist - the straight banana directive comes to mind. They hear the pub bore go on about how his mum's cousin's friend's dog's sister's brother's owner's gardener isn't allowed to climb a tree any more because 'probably the bloody EU' or how 'we can't even get rid of terrorists any more cos of the EU' (or read this stuff in the Daily Mail and Sun). 

There are also plenty of people who don't really understand it but have an impression of it as broadly benevolent and generally good for the economy and social stuff like the Working Time Directive.

People who actually understand the EU divide into two camps:

1. City people who have to understand it because it gives us a vast array of regulations that we have to enforce against each other in order to promote ethical finance and commerce. Of these, the lawyers tend to think that the regulations are good because they protect the consumers and keep us in a job. The financiers tend to find them a bit more frustrating because they limit the levels of risk that they can take on and therefore the profits that can be made through trading. No surprises which type Farage was when he worked in the City.

2. IR, politics, law graduates who have studied it to degree level or beyond. Views are mixed, but come from a critical and informed point of view. Included in this are several politicians and journalists, but also bureaucrats, business people and academics.

Do you know what neither of these groups have done? Educate or inform people about the realities of the EU. That is because it is basically boring. You don't give a shit about the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, but it is one of the main things protecting your pension from another market collapse. Things like the Working Time Directive are universally liked, especially by contracted low wage workers, but now taken pretty much for granted.

In contrast, the misinformation peddlers have gone full on with the EU, led by UKIP and the Daily Mail, telling everyone that it is basically an immigration issue, and that we are being run by evil secret men in Brussels. That is a much simpler and more exciting narrative than the boring reality of regulations and directives, and it explains a lot of problems without too much actual thought.

That is not to say that there are not sensible and educated people who are against the EU. It's just that none of them are leading the calls for a referendum, or even being listened to by UKIP and its supporters. The debate is so utterly based on misinformation that we are heading for another AV referendum where 

So why *do* people hate the EU? Ignorance and immigrants. Why *should* people hate the EU?

OBS will then contract with various suppliers to bring in the equipment and crews needed - for example in Beijing, almost every HD-capable outside broadcast truck in Europe had to be loaded on a ship and sent over. So the 2012 venues and broadcast centre were cabled by a German company. Rowing, Football and Tennis were done by British crews. Table Tennis by a crew from China, Basketball by Israelis, Cycling by Belgians and so on. Essentially bringing in people expert in covering that sport. But for the duration, they're employees of OBS.

Then the feeds get pumped to a central broadcast control room (London's was the biggest ever built until Rio's opens) where OBS will monitor the feeds, archive the footage so broadcasters can find the bit where someone scores or whatever, then send it off to each of the Rights-Holding Broadcasters' own control rooms where commentary is mixed in, various bits of presentation etc.

Additionally, you get a flat, consistent surface which, if prepared properly, is suitable for passing football.

A lot of players aren't keen on the surfaces but I think this may be something that it'll take a generation to get used to. I think it's change people don't like rather than the surface itself. For example, Falkirk's pitch looks immaculate and could easily be mistaken for grass.

At the lower league level, teams without artificial pitches are beginning to get left behind. As an Arbroath fan, I see the likes of Alloa (who get similar numbers through the gate) 2 divisions above us while the likes of Forfar and Stenhousemuir (who typically get significantly less through the turnstyle) are comfortably outperforming us.

Right now, ITV (Independant Television, the channel itself) is [split up into a number of regions throughout the UK](http://www.astra2sat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/itv-uk-network-map-e1423232266917.jpg), and before the 2000's companies used to bid to take over that region (much in the same way the railways work, I believe.)

One problem though - excluding the Scottish and N. Ireland regions, which are run by independent companies, *every single region is now run by one single company*: [ITV PLC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_plc).

And so the regions that make up ITV are useless, as you have one single company that runs every region in England and Wales, and this company has slowly managed to reduce the amount of regional news and programmes to a miniscule amount, even the Beeb has more regional-ness now at this point.

You fix ITV by getting new, independent companies to run the regions like it was before the 2000's, where you had HTV, Central, Granada, Carlton etc etc. [If it continues to just be this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/63/Itvplc_formation.png), then what's the bloody point?

A big player will not join a side where next manager is unknown, and there is no trust in current one. Besides, what will the reaction be if Pellegrini/Benitez wins a treble, we will appoint Pep no matter what? What happens if we finish 5th, Guardiola comes to play in Europa League?

I suspect the real reason we didn't get it is it's a specialist department and when the guy who set it up retired the Trust only put a temp guy in (for 4 years).

Almost ended up an Aresenal fan when I went to see a concert in a pub at Putney Bridge in 2001 and they had just won the championship.  Their fans were so happy, and everybody wanted to buy me a pint just so they could tell me all about it.  But I didn't keep up with the league until a couple year ago when they started showing Premier League games on Fox, and I just love the game.  The non-stop action (as compared to American football which is just endless commercials these days) is mesmerizing.  When it came to choosing who would be ""my"" team, I had to go with MCFC because of one of your finest, Noel Gallagher.  I have been a fan of British music since the 60s and Noel is my absolute favorite British songwriter of all time.  If MC are his team(an Liam as well), then they are my team.  But I hesitate to call myself a fan just yet.  I think you really have to understand the history of a team and understand all of the suffering  fans have endured before experiencing something as special as winning the cup in 2011 to be a true fan.  So I'm reading the wikipedia page, the club web sites, watching old videos on youtube and reading this group.  Looking forward to many years of becoming a true fan and eventually going to a game at CoM stadium.  I'm also buying a MC jersey to wear to my first Noel Gallagher concert in a few weeks.

Some of my best friends voted conservative after many an argument, they believed that the vote for the conservatives was in the best interests of the country. I can't hate that, as I voted for what I felt was best. 

My attitude is educate, not separate. If the conservatives introduced for example a universal basic income, which can be seen as a conservative policy to drive entrepreneurism and reduce the state then I'd vote for them as I feel it would be in the best interests for the country. I believe to vote for what you feel is right, for better or worse. The ones I don't like, both left and right of the spectrum are the ones that attack others ideals.

There is also the very first passage of the book which gives a nice description of the setting on the way to the Brush? If you read it,  it gives some positive imagery but then it contrasts with some negative imagery. The positive imagery could be representing the American Dream that people during that time were trying to achieve however the negative imagery could show the reality and futility of it. IIRC some of the quotes when describing the setting were 'lower leaf junctures'  and 'sycamore mottled limbs'? Something along those limes.  Sorry for the lack of quotes in this bit,  struggling to remember. 

There was also a quote to do with Candy,  Crooks and Lennie when I think Curley's Wife was looking for Curley which went something like 'So they left the weak ones'  which also shows  discrimination towards the characters and a sense of helplessness for the ranch workers.  Lennie,  I think Candy and Crooks had some kind of American Dream too but this discrimination can be showing the futility of the dream for people like them. 

This bit isn't a quote but I'm sure you can pick up one somewhere but it was the scene where Carlson shoots Candy's Dog which foreshadows the end when George shoots Lennie (George shooting Lennie is probably the saddest moment of my high school life :|) There was also the repeated use of 'silence' when Candy when to the bunk and layed down but I am struggling to think what this means :(

This is all I can think of from the top of my head at the moment,  sorry if I was being vague when talking about the quotes or the lack of proper quotes,  hopefully I was of some help.

null,false,Huwbacca,null,null,null,"Firstly, learning german or french at school is going to have little to no effect on later life. The quality of teaching foreign languages in the UK is shocking because a) we give very little respect to it and b) there is no opportunity to practice it in a natural environment, or learn it from native speakers. Learning up to GCSE french makes you less prepared to speak in france than learning GCSE maths would to make you an engineer.

Secondly, you won't run out of space by learning 1 language before another... if anything it will be easier, especially given that Welsh has gendered nouns, reverse noun and verb construction order common in many languages. As well as a shared heritage with any Gaelic influenced language. If anyone can handily learn their way around the way treiglads and contractions work in welsh, they can learn any language. Learning Welsh and English at school and then later needing to be able to speak German is no ones fault but your own if then didn't learn German.

Thirdly: You drastically under-appreciate the welsh language, which is not uncommon but it is uncalled for. It is one of the most fantastically rich and varied languages. It's linguistic influences range from Nordic, Gaelic, Breizh, Arabic and Hebrew. It's construction is so beautiful and poetic, even the most mundane of things like the circumflex ( ^ ) is wonderful in welsh - *to bach* - a little roof. When you describe the rain or snow, you don't say fall, you say *bwrw* because the rain in wales beats down. Chips!! Chips is *sglodion*, how can you not want to learn a language that has *sglodion!*... *Faint o'r gloch?* - That's not what is the time, that is how many of the bell. You don't 'go for a walk'... you *mynd am dro* - you go for a turn, because if you have to turn and come back.

You don't spend years posturing for the role of PM, building up a powerbase and waiting for your moment to pounce, only to back out 48 hours later because - apparently, shock fucking horror, the press apparently take a bit of an interest in the man who would be king...

Chuka Ummuna has been gearing up for a leadership bid for the better part of the last 3-4 years. I highly doubt that an educated man like himself decided on the ""spur of the moment"" to put his name in for the leadership race without considering what it might involve. Clearly he would have considered the interest the press might take in his life.

The reality therefore is that somewhere, someone probably has some major dirt on him which he does NOT want out in public. I doubt its his drugs background - given that hes already publicly admitted to being involved with ""soft"" drugs during his DJ-ing days. It *could* be hard drugs - but I suspect this might be something a little bit more complex.

**TL:DR** This is **PRECISELY** why media scrutiny of politicians is important to our democracy.

null,false,PodgeBear,null,null,null,"Good sites for property are places like www.rightmove.co.uk or www.zoopla.co.uk - that should give you an idea of what is in the area, budgets and so on.

My family of 4 spends around £200/month on food - my kids get school dinners free at primary school which helps! 

There aren't any free kindergartens (it's called nursery over here usually, though most people understand kindergarten too); children aged 3+ get a few hours a week free, but it's still very expensive. I rent a 3 bed semi detached house about 40 mins outside Guildford, and my son's nursery fees cost more per month than my rent! A common alternative is a childminder - your child goes to the childminder's house. They will have several children in their care at once so can charge less, but if they are sick there's no backup.

Costs to include: electricity, gas, water, council tax (pays for rubbish collection, policing etc), rent, phones, Internet, car insurance, car tax, TV licence, satellite TV if you need it (I don't bother), food.

On that salary, you should be fine. I live in an expensive town and manage to pay rent, bills, run 2 cars etc on £45k.

Also think about things like getting a national insurance number - assuming you're payrolled here, you need to pay tax and insurance here. National insurance is what pays for your access to healthcare, so it's important. You'll need to register with a GP too, and a dentist - dentists aren't free, but are much cheaper if you're an NHS patient.

If you're driving in the UK, you'll need to get a UK driving licence. I believe you get 12 months on an international one, but after that you need to pass our test. The DVLA will give you more info.

A great source of info is www.gov.uk - lots of simple advice in clear English. I'd also recommend looking up your local council site when you know it - http://www.surreycc.gov.uk is the county council site, but when you know where you're living, you'll also have a borough council as well - I live in Elmbridge, which is in Surrey too.

This is very long now so if there's anything else I can help with, feel free to PM me. Best of luck with the move - it's a lovely place to live round here!

Once a year enter all your income from all your activities in the correct box. Enter all the purchases in another box. You'll also have to pay a bit more national insurance.

At the end as a bonus I earned the right to buy a coffee maker at a discount (the machine would be £15 for me). Referencing amazon, who had the same machine at £40, and realizing it would come out the same as my gambling money + ordering it at the discount, I went ahead and ordered it (there's a decent list of discounted items to choose from as a sort of consolation). 

Essentially I chose to buy a nice coffee machine for £40 total (same as amazon) instead of only entertaining myself for £25 with no bonus.

Actually I quite like the dolce gusto and I've traded my daily cafe tierre mess for the thing. I do use it daily and I've grown quite attached to it.

null,false,Nyxi26,null,null,null,"Few questions:

1. Have you ever signed an Assured Shorthold Tenancy agreement?

2. If no to the above, have you ever signed anything at all for the property?

2. Is your deposit protected (DPS/TDS etc.)?

3. Was this visitor able to identify themselves and/or was your landlord aware of the visit?

Reasoning:

1. If yes, once the AST has expired, you are legally considered to have fallen into a statutory periodic tenancy ('month by month') so the landlords request is valid. If you have a signed AST still within the tenancy period, the landlord cannot change this without your explicit signed consent.

2. Regardless of your answer to this question, if you don't have an AST your options here are roughly limited to making a verbal agreement with your landlord or taking him/her to court. If you do have a signed document I suggest taking it to a professional for advice.

3.  If no, your landlord is breaking the law and liable to pay you compensation of 3x the value of the deposit. Realistically you'd need to take this to court to enforce but it might work as a bargaining chip.

4. If no, it was probably a distraction burglary. Ignore all other advice and check your stuff for evidence of thieves and/or scoundrels.

Re the whole debt thing, if your landlord does owe tax the council will attempt to recover that amicably before doing anything that will affect your tenancy.  As long as you can evidence that you're a tenant not the owner you're not connected. 

I think at this point you should speak to the landlord and try to work out the exact situation before deciding what to do.",null,0,null,1431731139,null,0,false,0,craircu,null,t3_363tvm,null,t1_craircu,null,t3_363tvm,null,null,null,1433087579,null,6,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,6,null

To be fair I spent quite some time observing first, and then spent my credits bidding on more credits before boredom got me on day 3. I ended up with like a value of £500 of won credits, which I then used to bid on the toys (and obviously lost)

So '£500' of 'spent credits' got me a stunning 'spent credit' discount of RRP in the end, so I can easily see how someone might get scammed into over-paying for consolation prizes.

It's quite a pain to calculate what you've spent on bids, especially when you bid on credits and win them with other credits, or they 'double' or 'triple' the credits for you, so I imagine anyone who doesn't observe first and do their maths would lose out immediately.

I  still think it's sort of basic logic though, to check up, you know, what exactly this site is, and calculate risk first before you spend your money. Maybe it's not the most ethical thing, but fools and their money are easily parted I guess.

The one shady thing was some of the bidders seemed potentially fake. Maybe they just had the tenacity and endurance of bidding and winning on millions of credit auctions before spending hundreds of pounds per go on multiple auctions at a time, but I'm tempted to say they were possibly bots. Obviously that can't be proven one way or the other, they also could've just been smart people with a fuckton of won credits.

Same as now, minus on beautiful bald man.  Hugo will be top three in the Prem, Vorm will probably be the second best backup in the league barring Cech moving from Chelsea.

Defense:

Walker will be somewhere between his recent form and his great form from the first half of last year.  He'll be good, and we'll be content at least with him at right back.  Yedlin will get the odd sub appearance and be nothing special, and will continue to be an annoying point of contention on this sub.

Rose and Davies will be good, with Rose hopefully building on his good year and ideally both staying fit.

Dier is my big pick for a breakout year.  Ideally, we don't have to play him at RB at all, and he can build a great starting pairing with Vert.  

Central Midfield:

Bentaleb will continue to grow and become one of the better CMs in the league, and will actually be widely regarded as a top talent. Honestly, I don't know who ese will be here next year, s I don't have any expectations.

Wings:

Lamela finishes strong these next two weeks and comes into the year as the first choice RW.  Becomes a solid player at least, and people stop thinking we should fucking sell him. Townsend hopefully plays on the left and is as important to use as Azza was when he and Bale were terrorizing fullbacks under 'Arry.  Chadli plays well as an auxiliary forward and we rotate the two based on opposition (pipe dream).

null,false,aenor,null,null,null,"&gt;TL:DR Quebec. How are they comparable?

Quebec had a referendum in the mid 1990's - and unlike the Scottish referendum it was close - 50.48% No. So less than a percentage point to stay within Canada.

The pattern was similar - just after they lost their referendum, there was a surge of activity, people joining the party, campaigning etc. The Parti Quebecois won the state legislature and the Bloc Quebecois captured pretty much all the MPs sent to the federal parliament. Sound familiar?

The Federal govt was controlled by the Liberals and Jean Chretien was the Prime Minister - himself from Quebec but a supporter of the Union, as was his party. I guess the Liberals are the Canadian equivalent of Labour. 

Anyway, they devolved power to Quebec, and it was an asymmetric devolvement that annoyed the other states and annoyed the First Nation tribes (who were already ticked off at the Quebecois because their independence plans involved dividing Cree nation lands).

Anyway, Quebec loved their new powers and quickly set about creating what they thought was their socialist paradise state - they thought they would prove how great they were, and on the back of it voters would back another referendum. It took about ten years for the voters to notice that businesses were quietly upping and moving to Toronto (in neighbouring Ontario) and jobs were being lost.

Once they noticed, they kicked out the Parti Quebecois and re-elected the Liberals both in the state legislature and the federal elections. In 2011, the Bloc Quebecois representation in the Federal govt collapsed from 49 MPs to just 4. Parti Quebecois did have a minority govt within the state though, and in 2014, excited by the Scottish referendum, they started on about independence again. Quebec voters were so horrified they thrashed them at the polls. Enough time had passed for them to realise that they were better off with Canada and they are determined never to have another referendum. And the way to do that is to prevent nationalist parties from being elected.

So Labour just need to be patient - play a watch and wait game. Apeing the SNP just feeds the beast. Back off a bit. Let them have their FFA and hang themselves - then you and your colleagues can move in and say ""We'll pick up the pieces, we're the ones who have always really had your interests at heart"".

In the meanwhile there is work to be done in England - one-nation Labour people are *always* welcome in England to live, work and help campaign elections.

We then all went out the back door into a beautiful expansive garden with vibrant colors and shit...nothing like the house. Then for some reason we all got into swimwear.

There are many people who could make a worthy contribution to the upper house with their expertise and experience who would not or could not fight an election.

There are a lot of practical issues too. Is anyone allowed to stand for election to the upper house? If so, how is it any different to the commons? You'll just end up with another chamber full of polititcians and party politics. You might just as well campaign for the lords to be abolished entirely.

If not, who chooses who's allowed to stand? Someone has to decide the rules, and someone has to decide if each candidate meets those rules. If someone else gets to choose who we're allowed to vote for, how is that any more democratic than what we have now, where a democratically accountable body appoints peers?

How would the elections work? Practically we can't have all 725 (or whatever number, if reform were to shrink the house) seats contested on a ballot paper. 

Do you give peers constituencies? Are we then supposed to decide if we'd rather have a doctor or a diplomat in the upper chamber? Worthy candidates would lose because they're in a consituency with other good candidates, while subpar choices would get in because of little competition in their area. How would local issues be relevant to a peer?

Or woud it be proportional? If you make it proportional by party then you've just got another mirror chamber of the commons, where people vote along party lines and not on the merits of the issue. If not by party, then what? Businessmen vs. Engineers?

The Lords should be there to scruitinise the activities of the government and the commons and provide expert input in the drafting of legislation, free from party political nonsense.

“Rule 1. The Doctor lies.”
“Rule 7. Never run when you're scared.”
“Rule 27. Never knowingly be serious.""
“Rule 408. You should always waste time when you don't have any. Time is not the boss of you.”
― Steven Moffat

“Third Doctor: A straight line may be the shortest distance between two points, but it is by no means the most interesting” 
― Robert Holmes 

 “Some people live more in twenty year than others do in eighty. It's not the time that matters, it's the person. - The Doctor” 
― Stephen Greenhorn 

“To the rational mind, nothing is inexplicable; only unexplained.” 
― The Doctor 

“As we learn about each other, so we learn about ourselves” 
― William Hartnell 

“I'd forgotten not all victories are about saving the universe.” 
― Steven Moffat  

“I am the Bad Wolf. I create myself. I take the words. I scatter them ... in time, and space. A message to lead myself here.” 
― Russell T. Davies 

“I do think there’s always a way to put things right. If I didn’t believe that I wouldn’t get out of bed in the morning, I wouldn’t eat breakfast; I wouldn’t leave the TARDIS ever. I would never have left home. There is always something we can do.” 
― Paul Magrs, Doctor Who: The Stones of Venice 

“The Doctor is all of us, he lives and dies as all of us, and we need him to – because no matter the anvil-imagery of the Doctor as Christ, this is actually a far older and far simpler story than that. Everything changes. We all regenerate. I am not the same woman who first saw Rose ascend. Years go by and I become someone new, with the same memories but a new face, a new self.” 
― Catherine Valenti 

“Heroes are important. Heroes tell us who we want to be but when they made this particular hero they didn’t give him a gun, they gave him a screwdriver to fix things. They didn’t give him a tank or a warship or an X-Wing, they gave him a call box from which you can call for help and they didn’t give him a superpower or a heat-ray, they gave him an extra heart. And that’s extraordinary. There will never come a time when we don’t need a hero like the doctor.” 
― Steven Moffat

Watching a player actually play is the better route to go. Even then I highly doubt you (myself included) watched a U-19 international friendly at 8 pm on a Friday. Plus, it's only one game. It doesn't speak for the rest of his play. By that logic Torres should still be here because of his Barcelona game.

RLC still lacks *a lot* of confidence, experience, vision going forward, passing, and much more. 
 
Pogba on the other hand is amazing going forward, has amazing vision, stronger defensively, and is a commander in the midfield who has a TON of confidence under his belt. These skills have easily made him one of the best midfielders at his age (virtually the same age as Ruben too).

Now, I'm not saying we should go all out on Pogba OR we should push out RLC. But to say we shouldn't buy Pogba based solely on a youtube highlight video is absolutely insane.

Seriously, if your police create a hostile atmosphere, you WILL GET a hostile atmosphere.

And don't down-vote me because you're a stupid little bitch. 

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-04-08/us-police-kill-more-civilians-march-uk-police-killed-100-years


Shooting un-armed people is considered a crime here. what happened to you?

If there's any chance of him grabbing a weapon, then COMMON SENSE would dictate, that YOU ARE STANDING TOO CLOSE TO THEM&gt;


Why is it that Americans have no common sense anymore? it's fucking basic!

EDIT&gt; right, I'm really fucking pissed about this, so I'm going full retard....

Right the first thing is that your government DOES NOT care about people.
It never has, especially since the 70's.

The black people in your country are treated like SHIT.
you know full well, that black people in America are discriminated against on a DAILY basis.
That is not right. it is fucking wrong.

The reason why there is such a high crime rate in the black community is because most of them are living in poverty. Your social benefits system is a fucking joke, and there are not enough jobs in America to go around.
This is what I mean about your government it doesn't give a fuck about you or your black people.

The black peopel get swept to the bottom of the pile, and you wounder why the crime rate rises. basically it is down to poverty.

2nd to this, your poice officers, now prefer to follow rule books rather than CARE about the community.
Your police officers should be more concerned about peoples welfare, rather than shooting people for stupid and meanial things which aren't even serious.
if the police took a different approach to the problem AND RELISED that the government, it's policies and it's ATTITIUDES towards the American people were wrong then maybe something could be done about it.

that will not happen if your police are so fucking hell bent on ""compliance"".
who the fuck is going to accept the commands of some jumped up fuck with a metal badge?

we would not even DREAM of that in England. the only way I will respect a policeman in England is if they are polite in the first place.
Respect does NOT come from a gun. it comes from attitude and the behaviour towards others.

your police are no better than criminals once they decide to neglect the community and treat them as a constant military threat.

If someone tried to tell me what to do, wether they have a metal badge or not, you can imadge the 4 letters words, I would use in response!


the problem is the policing and policing policies of your country. the government is your real enemy and the problems I have is understanding WHY your police officers don't understand this?

Stop killing people and fix the problem.

Notice how whenever he gets a wee bit brave and stands up, the English guy stands up too, making it clear he is willing to fight the idiot. The Scottish guy realises at that very moment that he would not win that fight, and finds an excuse to back down. Then, feeling unsatisfied, he goes back to see how far he can push his luck without having to actually fight the guy. This happens a few times throughout the video.

He continues to try and find some kind of submission in the English guy by shouting at him, threatening him, bragging about his nationality, mocking his choice of beverage(fuckin' Tennent's fuckin' super fuckin' lager). The calmer the English guy stays, the more he tries to push his aggression on him.

If you say it's to work (even unpaid work, such as an internship) and you don't have a visa for that, you will be turned around and sent straight back to the US without setting foot in the UK. If you say you're also an EU citizen, then if the border staff are feeling charitable they might just send you back into the arrivals hall and make you go through the UK/EU Citizens entry line where you would be expected to present an EU passport.

Alternatively upon arrival you could say you're just here on holiday. As long as that's believable (i.e. you have a return ticket, a hotel room booked, and enough money on you) you'll be allowed in with a six month visitor's visa.  If you were then to start working then technically you're in breach of that visa, but as long as you can prove you're actually an EU citizen you're very unlikely to ever get found out, let alone in any trouble.

However, if you enter on a six-month visitor's visa as an American, and then stay in the country longer than that (legally) because you're an EU citizen, then when your six-month visa runs out you'll be flagged up on the UK immigration system as an overstayer. Nobody will send out squads of immigration officials specifically looking for you, but if you ever do come into a situation where your immigration status gets checked you'll have an awful lot of complicated explaining to do.

TLDR: you're better off getting official documentation (i.e. a passport) from the EU country you're a citizen of and using that to enter the UK.

It doesn't take much intelligence to understand that Chelsea will ask more for a player who is first choice than someone who is backup. It obviously means a lot.

Yet more evidence that Cech will not be sold for 10m pounds.

He's still got a while to go. I brought up van der sar to tell you that he signed at age 34 for united and had 5 magnificient years, and that Cech can replicate that. 

&gt; It doesn't take much intelligence to understand that Chelsea will ask more for a player who is first choice than someone who is backup. 

Bit of a low blow?. Chelsea's situation is unique..I brought that up because you said: ""There is no precedent for a second choice keeper selling for 10 at the tail end of their career"" which really sounds like you undervalue him because a) he's got a lot of time left and b) he could walk into almost any team in the world and be first choice. Because of him we have the best goalkeeping duo in the world. He is more than capable of being a starter for Chelsea, its just his misfortune that Mourinho sees courtois as a tad bit better than him. Whoever he goes to will be extremely lucky if they get him for 10 mil or under, and knowing the fantastic business chelsea have been doing lately, i wouldn't put it past them to know this and get good money out of him, especially if he does go to somewhere like arsenal. 

I never said that Cech will not go for under 10m, Im saying I think it would be a steal if he did go for 10 mil or under. But sure, I'm not one to back out of a challenge. So if he does go for under 10mil ill wear the liverpool badge for next season, if I win then you don't have to do anything because I don't get any satisfaction out of that. I will always stand by big pete.

And I'm sorry to say I don't know. We don't know what they intend to do.

It would be perfectly legal for them to implant malware on every PC in the UK. They could track every website you visit, every file you create, every email or chat message you send. They could decide to block our access to websites or services, they've already done this with the much publicised piratebay. I think I'm right in saying they could 'hack' a suspected terrorists machine before, this will make it legal for them to do it to people who aren't even suspects.
&gt;In February, a code of practice for GCHQ which gives “spy agencies sweeping powers to hack targets, including those who are **not a threat** to national security **nor suspected** of any crime”

I think the term ""cyber attack"" is a bullshit term used by idiots, they have no clue what it means, I'm not even sure it has a meaning. It will cover PC's, laptops, phones, maybe consoles, anything that connects to the internet. We're at the stage where every dam thing is connected, cars for example, home heating, CCTV in your house. These would all be fair game under the ""cyber"" bullshit-banner.

It also poses a security risk for everyone, if GCHQ are using a security flaw to get access to your computer, it's plausible that somewhere a much smarter hacker is using the same flaw to plant information on your drive, use your identity to post something unsavoury online, or the good old stealing your credit card. Basically the governent would be using the exact kind of thing they should be protecting us from, against us.

Of course Manquillo is just standing between Sakho and Valencia doing nothing. And the ball comes into the far post and it's a goal.

That being said Sakho's cross was a bit flukey and went into the goal itself. But if it hadn't then Valencia at the far post would have had an easy header. Plus if it wasn't for Valencia at the far post and free I doubt Mignolet would have run out to try and fail to catch the ball. If he stayed on his line he might have caught it but he wanted to get it before Valencia. Either way it was a goal. And that was really irritating. Because it is basic defending.

null,false,schala09,null,null,null,"It sounds like you're mostly arguing against national closed-list PR. Which I agree with -- such a system doesn't really make sense, except for extremely small countries (think Liechtenstein). Israel is a textbook case of why such a system doesn't really work as well as its proponents might think.

Luckily, there are many compelling alternatives. The additional member system, already used in Scotland and Wales, ensures that everyone gets to keep their single-member constituency, but the overall party makeup of the chamber matches the regional vote. 

Another option is to use the single transferable vote, or even closed-list PR, but with smaller constituencies. Constituencies of about 10 MPs would produce results that are within 10% of optimal (roughly speaking), while still being small enough to deliver meaningful regional representation.

What all of these options have in common is that they maintain the principle of responsible government. When you split representatives into two groups, and require each group to separately support the government, it's very hard not to end up with gridlock. This is why virtually every presidential democracy in history has experienced a major destabilisation at some point in its history. (Considering the American Civil War, the US is hardly an exception.) But if you keep everyone in one chamber, then it's still possible to make forward progress, because there's bound to be a majority for something or other.

Also, all of these options are already successfully used somewhere in the UK. In contrast, having two equally-powerful elected chambers would be one of the most fundamental changes to government structure in the history of the UK.

They sent me on a course for 'graduates' which would have a week's guaranteed graduate-level work experience at the end. It was mandatory but I needed the experience so went along.

The course was awful: there were people far more intelligent and qualified than I am - people with MAs in chemistry from UCL or graduates from Durham or Exeter - and we were making paper hats, learning how to use LinkedIn (we already know how to) and other dumb ideas in the name of training. Was a complete waste.

However, at the end they revealed the work experience after keeping it hush-hush for a few weeks. We were to teach the same course to more people from the Job Centre. Who would then go on to do the same. Meanwhile, the people running the course pockets the money awarded by the Job Centre.

Most people said yes, but they did kick up a fuss - demanding pizza takeaways and other expensive expenses - to reduce the company's profits.

A couple of us went to our local MP who was sympathetic and threatened to take the story to the Guardian - JCP acquiesced and after a few months the course was banned in our borough.

Your deposit must be protected in a government-backed scheme, so maybe ask your landlord for a copy of the protection certificate. There is no excuse or defence for not protecting a deposit other than its within a few days of the start of the tenancy - if it isn't done, the landlord is breaking the law.

It sounds like your landlord is probably doing the whole thing under the table so I think you may better off coming to some sort of agreement with them. Realistically, any action you could take would be cost prohibitive and if your objective is to stay in the flat suing the landlord is probably not a good way to go about that!

In the event the property was eventually repossessed for a debt to HMRC the type of tenancy may not matter, as there are provisions in the Housing Act to gain vacant possession without fault on your part (subject to caveats).

The essay is worth 30 marks (+ 4 spag), and there are 6 mark scheme bands each with 5 subsections. Therefore, in each paragraph, you have to do each subsection, and have 6 paragraphs which meet the subsections to gain full marks.
The subsections are as follows:
""Insightful explanatory response to task"" - this is your topic sentence
""Insightful explanatory response to test"" - this is your quote and evidence
""Close analysis of detail"" - this is picking out individual words and phrases and analyzing connotations, often referred to as ""zooming in""
""Evaluation of the writer's use of devices/structure/form and effects on readers and audience"" - this is where you pick out devices and analyze their effect
""Convincing/imaginative interpretation of ideas"" - this is just putting across your point clearly and expressing ideas well.

An example of a paragraph that meets all 5 is:
Eva Smith's discrimination is revealed through what Mrs Birling says, who suggests that the lower class are not even human, and that they do not have emotion (1). Mrs Birling exclaims how ""she was claiming elaborate fine feelings"", and the use of both ""elaborate"" and ""fine"" demonstrates that Sybil feels that it is impossible for ""girls of that class"" to have emotion and feelings.(2&amp;3) Furthermore, she states ""as if a girl of that sort would ever refuse money"". The repetition of ""that class"" and ""that sort"" suggests that Mrs Birling groups everyone in the lower class into one group, and that they all have the same malicious intentions.(3&amp;4) Mrs Birling has lived an upper class life her whole life, and her lack of exposure to the sufferings and lives of the working class has led to her misunderstanding of their situation (5)",null,0,null,1431764482,null,0,false,0,craveai,null,t3_363xuu,null,t1_craveai,null,t3_363xuu,null,null,null,1433093681,null,2,false,GCSE,t5_2u3gk,2,null

If he moves on, I can see us being seriously tested in our resolve to hold on to Lloris, and I could see us caving if the right price gets met. 


As far as Kane is concerned, it would be a mistake by the club and would set a terrible precedent for what our aspirations are. I also think it would be a bad move for Harry to move from somewhere he is adored and is one of the first names on the team sheet, to a club still sizing everything and everyone up.

We basically owe every success we've had in the last 15 years to this man. I don't give a monkeys what's written on his shoe but I'm sure as hell not going to moan about it.

null,false,ke_0z,,AustrianVillan,null,"As an Austrian who is also a supporter of Rapid Vienna, I first came to know Aston Villa when Rapid kicked them out twice (2009 and 2010) of UEFA Europa League qualification. Although I was of course happy at the time that Rapid beat Villa, I immediately took a liking in Aston Villa because just like Rapid Vienna, Villa is also a club with a long tradition and passionate fans.

Nevertheless, I didn't start to actively follow Aston Villa until this season of the Premier League. That was mainly because I just didn't watch Premier League games until this year.
Besides the earlier contact I made with Aston Villa and my general appreciation of old traditional clubs, there are several other reasons I started supporting AVFC.

As an avid Heavy Metal fan, I naturally came across Birmingham, as it is the city known as the birthplace of Heavy Metal, with bands like the mighty Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Led Zeppelin coming from Birmingham. Once I read that Ozzy Osbourne is a Villa supporter, which also led me to like this club. Moreover, Barney Greenway, the vocalist of Napalm Death, another Birmingham band that I love, also said in interview that he is an Aston Villa fan. So as you can see, my taste in music heavily influenced my choice of which English football club to support.

Furthermore, I remember that my mother once visited Birmingham, and when she came back (I was maybe 5 years old then), she told my how much she liked it there. This was more or less the first time someone told me about an English city, so it stuck with me (still have to visit Birmingham myself, though!).

Additionally, Aston Villa is the club that features most in Austrian press (well, besides the internationally playing clubs like Chelsea, Arsenal, Man City etc.), because of Andreas Weimann (who was a youth player at Rapid Vienna btw!). Having an Austrian playing in the Premier League is something special for us here and at that time, he was the only one (now Marko Arnautovic is playing at Stoke City). Unfortunately, Weimann didn't have a very good season personally this year, neither at Aston Villa nor with the Austrian national team.

This has been blown completely out of proportion I think. Feels like it's his fucking funeral.

exactly, this is actually a VERY good thing for the club - 

&gt;if he stays he plays

what i mean by that is he is given his place in the side, anyone thinking clearly can see he hasn't actually been the best option in games but he's been picked due to who he is - that's a dangerous thing to do as you're intentionally not picking the best team. 

tbh i think the failure of striking options this season has not only been down to Sturridge' injury but that needing an extra man in midfield has meant the team lost one upfront (and no i don't mean Suarez)

after he leaves its a chance to actually pick 11 players making a team, not someone who publicly called out a team mate on national TV and displayed quite negative qualities in regards to how good a team player he was, when he's performing week in week out it's easy to see why others would pass to him but when he's not it kind of becomes clear it's not because he's the best option but that he was demanding it as captain - to me that's kind of abusing position and not putting the team first.

For me it was not 'space' to learn languages that was the issue, but rather the time to do so; I had only the time to learn one language in addition to the usual science et cetera, and had no choice in which. So in part I do blame the school system for forcing me to learn Welsh, rather than another language.

It's not that I don't think Welsh should be there as an option, but rather it should remain at that and not be 'forced' on students. 

Finally, I do agree wholeheartedly with the sentiment of the article - ""Tradition and heritage are important - but much more important is to ensure that we do not reduce the opportunities available for Welsh children"". This really resonates with me, I fear that by teaching welsh (often in the place of another language) we are isolating welsh children in an increasingly globe environment.

null,false,chochazel,null,null,null,"&gt; And it's not a new thing - back in 1945 the Daily Express scaremongered that an Attlee govt would be like the Gestapo! I kid you not. It didn't work mainly because half the electorate were still at war, posted abroad in France, Germany, Africa and Asia and not reading the Express. That was a one-off situation though (having your voters insulated from the poisonous press by a world war).


I don't think that's how it happened at all.  It was Winston Churchill who said that the Attlee government would be like the Gestapo and it absolutely did gain traction, but only in the sense that it completely backfired on him.  Attlee immediately leapt on it, and used it to his full advantage.  It gave Attlee the opportunity to show a clear difference between Churchill as a great wartime leader/statesman, and Churchill as a partisan politician playing dirty and using the war to his own political advantage.     In modern terms it was the first instance of Godwin's Law!  Having been admired as the man who stood up to the Nazis, here was Churchill saying the Labour Party (members of which formed a key part of his own war cabinet) were like the Nazis, at once belittling the achievements of all those who had been engaged in a life or death struggle to fight real Nazis, and undermining all the respect the British public had for him!  Having lost the election Churchill said that he didn't regret the speech and that it would be remembered as one of his greatest, but it lost none of its notoriety over time. It's often considered one of the great blunders of British election history.  The Express were only endorsing what Churchill had famously declared and it would have been widely known.
