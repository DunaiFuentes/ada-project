No it isn't. Banks use fractional reserve banking to ""create"" money. It has to be repaid, it's a zero sum. If people don't pay the banks back then the money costs the banks.

QE is not that at all. It's done by creating money which has the absolute and certain effect of reducing the value of that currency. It's simply taking percentage of money from absolutely everybody and the people that lose the most are people on benefits, poor people etc.

&gt;But it will create jobs and there will be a multiplier effect in the economy. 

Are you from the Mugabe school of economics?

&gt;So actually this is better for the poor as we don't have to pay interest to banks on this money.

The poor hate the loopholes. It makes no difference to them if the amount of income needed to make use of these things is ¬£60k or ¬£900k of income a year, it's an amount they are never going to earn. 

The middle class like the loopholes.  It's something aspire to make use of but is constantly moved out of reach by changes in legislation; when the cut-off was 45k?  They earned 40k in total.  They've chased the dream of being rich for years and it's always been moved just out of reach.

If there was, there has been no reason and apparently not even the moderators were told. In a community powered site, that's unacceptable. At least put out *some* statement explaining a different of opinion or whatever. But to do it to a popular figure overnight with no warning? Not smart. 

&gt; I don't see why the mods are punishing us because they let the admins walk all over them in the first place. 

What power do the mods have over the admins exactly? I doubt any of them wanted it this way? What could they do about it except say 'please don't do this' and hope it gets noticed... which it doesn't sound like it was?

Again there are only certain options the mods have open to them. Again this is a community driven site and if the voluntary element of the community that helps make this place what it is is screwed around then they can either leave things as they are and post a message of protest - which might well do nothing - or make a more prominent stand and point by blacking out. 

I support the blackout personally. I don't care about being inconvenienced in the short term if it means a better run site in the long term.

Many people earning less than [the figure I'm sick of typing] cannot do those things, or struggle to do those things.

And they all live in poverty

&gt;The most recent one found that 'most people in the UK' agree that one's parents being unable to afford 'one ¬£50 birthday present' for you is among the definitions of a child living in poverty.

Obviously the line we draw will be arbitrary and will change with times and cultures, but everything you've just said agrees with what I'm saying that poverty is a function of how much money someone has and how much it costs them to live. How you define 'how much it costs to live' might change between times and places, but it is important. The relative poverty measure totally ignores the cost of living which is why it's bullshit. 

&gt;I think it's insulting to find someone whose entire problem is that they don't have enough money and then tell them that their poverty isn't 'real'

What are you on about - That's exactly what I'm saying. You live in poverty if you don't have enough money, and whether or not you have enough money is defined by how much your life costs. How much money you neighbour has is totally irrelevant. 

&gt;So, if Alice has a cold, does the fact that Bob has cancer mean she's not sick?

If Alice gets a cold it doesn't mean that Bob's healthier - Of course you could argue that if we used a ridiculous relative illness measure, but it wouldn't make Bob healthier any more than the financial crisis would take poor people out of poverty.

The modern guidance is [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/trustee-expenses-and-payments-cc11/trustee-expenses-and-payments#paying-trustees-for-services) and says you can do it if your governing documents explicitly permit it. I believe this is new,  and will not apply to longer-established charities unless they have overhauled their documentation.

Notice the hoops that you have to go through. No trustee should be able to get fat that way. Few treasurers would attempt  any substantial  arrangement of that type without discussing it with the CC (who are actually very approachable and helpful).

Good:

* Speed of banking system (instant bank transfer are great)
* Couriers (DPD/RM are top class, not a lot of competition in France)
* Taxes I don't mind paying a lot of taxes but I pay about 20% less than I would in France

* Internet speeds (ISPs really fucked us in France and it's only slowly rolling out in cities)
* Supermarket deliveries (cheap, quick from almost every supermarket there is)
* Tea time

Bad (lots of those things only apply to the north):

* Weather is shocking
* Customer service, particularly dealing with banks
* Vegetables (vegetables/fruits are inedible in most places), where do you even get ripe vegetables?
* Take-away food (maybe I don't want to eat fucking fish n chips)
* Housing is ridiculously expensive, we're buying a house at the end of the year and would get something so much nicer in France in a similar area

35 seems overly optimistic, but I don't know what career you are in and therefore what salary increases you are expecting, and what kind of pension income you want in the future. 

Be aware though, even if your salary was going to increase dramatically on your way to 35, the maximum you can pay in is ¬£40k in any one year. 

Looking at annuity rates at the moment, the best RPI linked rate you can get for ¬£100k retiring at 55, not 35, is ¬£2.2k, so if you wanted a pension of ballpark ¬£10k a year, like the salary you are going to be taking before you hit 35, you would need a pension pot of roughly ¬£500k by the time you are 55. Assuming average of 2.5% returns after inflation, that would imply you need ¬£300k by the time you are 35. So if I assume you are 20 now, that is an average of ¬£20k put into your pension each year, or a bit less for the potential market returns over the next 15 years. 

That is technically feasible if your salary rises straight line at 5% a year, but 1) that has not been common for at least the last 7 years, and 2) when it was common, inflation rates were at 3%, and in order to keep your standard of living, you would need to have pay-rises of 5% above inflation each year for the next 15 years. Definitely possible, especially in the early years of your career, and with this model you end up on the equivalent of ¬£42k in your 35th year.

You would then have to live off the ISA money from 35 to 55, which is going to be difficult, assuming you are saving 5k per year for the next 15 years in ISAs, that gives you ballpark of ¬£90k after some modest post inflation growth, which gives you ¬£4.5k a year to draw down until you retire. 

Surprisingly, it sounds like it is technically possible (Someone tell me if my maths if way way off, because I went into this thinking it wasnt going to be possible)

but it will massively limit your life choices. Whatever your lifestyle is now, it would have to be that for the rest of your life, which may not bother your, but means things like, no kids, no big holidays, even second hand cars are going to be difficult to budget for, no boiler repair....etc. ",null,0,null,1435953084,null,0,false,0,csrancs,null,t3_3bz4nb,null,t1_csrancs,null,t1_csr34o7,null,null,null,1437561137,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

It sounds harsh but what people keep missing when they point out moderators do it for free, is that part of the reason for that, is that a job won't be judged to warrant a wage if hundreds or thousands (on the larger subs) of people are waiting in the wings to take over, also for free. 

Technically Reddit could announce it is recruiting new mods on all subs that blacked out, ban the accounts of the previous mods, and remove the power of mods to close subs going forward. It's more for PR reasons that they wouldn't do that, than the irreplaceability of the current mods.

Advertising isn't in your face (I'm sure its there subtly) and bar the fattening and what ever the hell has gone on today Reddit seems to rumble on in that it provides a semi open platform for its users. On a personal level, the stuff that has been removed didn't cross my radar so it has made little difference to me

The big problem though is how the site monitrises and pays its way.  It must take a shit ton of cash over whats provided by donation so there for we are the product and some how how we use the site and what we post must count as a revenue stream. I mean, user data on 163 million unique has to be worth something to someone.

As it stands though at the moment, I can't really see how it can produce more profit though with out losing its core values and having a cloud of chaff by way of dodgy subs removed.  If you do this, you piss the user groups off and the pitch forks come out.  If the execs do this too much and too often, the site will lose users and become another Dribble.

Hypothetically, Google buys out the site.  They throw cash at it, they mine the data and sell it to god knows who and sit back in the afterglow of knowing they have a massive piece of the internet.  They are going to use the site as a cash cow - and they are very, very savy about doing this.  They will make money of of adverting and data.  The issue I see here is that few people who use Reddit trust Google about as much as they like Ms Pao.  Its going to lose users and lose popularity.

So Microsoft buys the site.  Why? God only knows.  Microsoft makes shonky operating systems and office software, and has flogged them very successfully world wide. Just about everything else they have been involved with hasn't really worked out for them.  A dabble in consoles that has only work out because games manufactures (generally owned by MS) supported it, a search engine, yammer, nokia and a shed load of other companies that are or have turned out a bit meh since acquisition.  MS has a stake in Facebook so maybe there would be a data angle but I can't see MS wringing out much of a profit from it either.  The issue I see here is MS would have no idea of what to do with Reddit, and Reddit on the whole doesn't trust MS much to get things right.

I live on the border of Cotham/High Kingsdown. I think it's the best part of the city - there is nowhere better placed. Gloucester Road is 10 minute walk, Stokes Croft is closer. St Michaels Hill REALLY close and Whiteladies Road, Clifton Triangle and Park Street are all within 15 minutes walk - all of these places you should go and check out at some point I would say. Also the Harbourside is dead close (easy for you to walk to work and your legs will get a small workout walking home uphill) as is Cabot Circus if you like shopping.

Kingsdown Leisure centre has an alright gym and should be very close to where you are going to live.

Second the other person saying go to Lakota, a 10 minute (ish) walk from High Kingsdown. I agree that Black Swan is also great but a bit farther away. I like the Full Moon as well. 

In Stokes Croft there are a few bars and clubs and really great cafes there stretching into Gloucester Road - my favourite is the Bristolian Cafe on Picton Street in Montpelier but Canteen is also great and there are loads of supposedly good ones I havent tried. 51. Stokes Croft is a electro bar that does ace pizzas upstairs and are cheap in the week (and not expensive other times either really).

We also do other interesting stuff like coalescing packets on the wire to reduce host CPU overhead (merging N streams into 1 generally means your packet rate becomes 1/N).

Stuff like that...

&gt;ISIS are fucking thundercunts, no one denies that, but instead of looking at it as ""bad people are bad"" and instead to ""why are these people bad and what can we do to avoid this in the future?"" a lot more interesting and constructive argument.

A lot of people are doing this at present, many are looking into the role religion and ideology play for example, Russell Brand isn't keen on going anywhere near that however, and is obsessed with making ISIS the responsibility of Capitalism and the Big Bad West.

That's how he comes off as an apologist.

Their actions aren't their responsibility, they're the West's. That's what he's about on this topic, and he always gets there by way of some kind of incredible mental gymnastics or another.

The thing that disgusts me most about Brand, is that while he claims to be all about peace and love, and apparently pacifism, he's perfectly happy for the wider world to ignore what's going on in Iraq and Syria. Ignore genocide and slaughter, when we have the capacity to prevent it.

And he's the guy that purports to care about life and human rights.

I considered university education a springboard into other things and spent a lot of time outside of uni working, doing personal projects and expanding my knowledge with the things I learnt at uni as my inspiration. I got heavily involved in helping out my department, and great things happened. (Like helping teach children about my subject at special drop-in days, attending careers fairs to represent the university etc).

The extra-curricular work I did really helped me mesh with my lecturers and demonstrators, which led to some interesting insight that probably helped my grades (not saying favouritism, as all our assignments were marked blind), just listening and getting a better sense for things. For example, being able to chat about concepts I was struggling with with senior lecturers in private.

&gt; Usage

&gt;In standard English less should only be used with uncountable things ( less money, less time). With countable things it is incorrect to use less ( less people and less words); strictly speaking, correct use is fewer people and fewer words. See also few (usage).

but it does also say this

&gt; 1.1Fewer in number:

&gt;[AS PRONOUN]: a population of less than 200,000
See usage below.

&gt;MORE EXAMPLE SENTENCES
In most cases fast greens present less problems when drawing around a blocking bowl.

&gt;It can be shown for example that there were less that 5000 men present but this is not of any importance.
Yes, but it would present less difficulties once it is acknowledged that the writ is almost as of right.

http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/less

Informally, you're probably fine using less all the time, but formally I would always try to use fewer and less correctly because it does often sound weird when using ""less"" incorrectly. Ultimately, it doesn't really matter.

null,false,emkindre,null,null,null,"For me, he has a good mix of everything you want in a CM or CDM in 4-2-3-1.  He has a solid positional understanding and is very tenacious defensively.  He is improving every time out in terms of his ball retention/decision making/playmaking.  The attributes in him that stands out above all of our other midfield options is his passion, positivity, and sense of urgency.  

Comparing he and Dembele:

Dembele catches the eye much more often with his unique ability to keep the ball and win out vs opposition in 1v1 battles in midfield, but for me he doesn't add much value to our team outside of games vs the top 4 challengers.  Against bigger opposition Dembele is very useful in helping us gain some control in possession.  Watching his game carefully though, it seems to me he is more interested in winning his individual 1v1 battle than he is in taking whatever action is required to help the team win.  He is the most entertaining yet frustrating player i see on a regular basis.  So often he works magic to beat his man only to turn into space and play a sideways or backwards pass.  He takes on many risks in dangerous positions on the pitch that have no reward.  

Bentaleb however, is a team first player that leads by example.  Looking over our squad you can maybe see a handful of players that play with their heart on their sleeve (Kane, Rose, Bentaleb, Mason, Lloris...maybe Lamela, Dier)  Bentaleb is the antidote to the blase attitude that has lingered with the team the last few years.  He is also far more useful against teams in the bottom half of the table than Dembele becuase he adds impetus and pace to our attack with quick decision making and a fearless positive attitude.  He hasn't offered entirely much in the attacking third for Spurs (that cross to Kane in NLD tho...) but he has done a little more on that front in 17 appearances  for Algeria.  Another favorable point for Bentaleb is the fact he is 20 years old with years to fine tune his weaknesses in that area.

This discussion is  frustrating for me because i think Dembele has everything one could need to be a top player that drives his team to trophies and I wanted so bad to see that growth take place with Spurs.  Unfortunately I'm resigned to Dembele being a useful squad player and not much more.  Moving forward, I feel it would be wise for the club in transfer dealings to look for a midfielder that compliments Bentaleb.
 
Who is that?

 It is hard to say right now because Bentaleb is an unfinished product and hard to predict what type of player he will be in 5 years.  If his progression halted right now and he never improved I would say Ryan Mason is a suitable partner for him. Bentaleb would do well next to an athletic, cerebral, and positive thinking midfielder that enjoys getting into the opposition box.  Paulinho, or what we wanted Paulinho to be, would have been an ideal partner.  A player that enjoys the defensive side of the game but is getting forward at any chance he gets.  Perhaps a future Bentaleb that has added a bit more end product to his game would be suited to play with more of a holding midfielder/destroyer type.",null,0,null,1435955919,null,0,false,0,csrc66y,null,t3_3bhemy,null,t1_csrc66y,null,t1_csm5uct,null,null,null,1437562103,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

 * Not knowing their language.

I am British but Indians say I have no identity. The reality is that there are massive cultural differences at play and they're assuming something in common exists because of my skin colour.

""What was so bad about Blair, anyway?""

""Blairite"" is an insult around much of the Labour party. 

a) he won elections, without doing that being ""right"" doesn't fucking matter. It would matter *slightly* more if we had PR, but Labour won't support that, will they? Turkeys, Christmas, etc.

b) He actually did a decent job running the country. 

Even Iraq, for which he is routinely crucified: Assume for a moment that the dossier was presented to him as it was to us, I'm sure it wasn't *quite*, but let's take the broad strokes at face value. There was, according to the best information he had available, an imminent threat against this country. How do you make any other decision? 

Of course I'm not saying it was perfectly conceived and executed, but put yourself in his shoes for a moment. 

So the economy? 

Yes, they over-spent. Much of it was necessary after an extended Conservative government who chronically *under*spent, so schools and hospitals and infrastructure wanted sorting out. Should never have sold the gold reserves, and the Child Trust Fund was moronic in 17 different ways. 

Otherwise: taxation was pretty fair, I'd have tweaked to my preference  but it wasn't ""screw the rich"" and it wasn't all ""tax the poor, there's more of them"" - his government straddled that line pretty well. 

Social policy? Not great for a Labour leader, but a lot of social policy is economics and the country hadn't caught up with widespread acceptance. 

Immigration ""Boomed"", sure, but that was an EU membership thing, and they *added* economic value. There is a sensible conversation to be had about social costs of immigration, but we never had it, the edges just shout at each other. 

I don't love the guy, I don't like much of what he's done since leaving office, and I don't think I'd want to go for a beer with him (beyond maybe ""it would be nice to pick the brain of a former PM away from all media""), but seriously, why all the hate?

This is called Imagined Communities.  We do it all the time when we stereotype, grouping people together and assuming they have the same traits, characteristics, problems, needs, desires etc etc.

It's a very political thing that's hard for any of us to really escape. We do it with gender, assuming all women face the same problems. We do it with people that read newspapers, assuming anyone that reads the Guardian or Daily Mail all think the same.  We do it with countries, say, ""the French"", assuming they behave, act and think the same and have the same wants and desires.

Governments find it useful to draw up policies when looking at stats for disabled, single parents, failing school children, or as this thread is discussing, terrorism.  It's easier to for them to broadly address this imagined group of people that, whilst they may have one thing in common, Guardian readers for example, they are all very different and have very different experiences and sets of circumstances that will shape their lives.

The key point is in the ""imagined"" part, these ""communities"" have largely never met each other.  in terms of ""the west"" ... we are grouped together in terms of socio-economic terms, but mostly as individuals we Brits don't have a lot of contact with the French, or Germans etc.

It's just a catch all term that does good at scratching the surfaces of things but never really looking at real problems and issues feeding any discussion.

It's easy for the Government to point to IS and say ""terrorist"" to instill fear, and have us all believing that all they want to do is destroy us. But talk to anyone of those people that identify as IS and you'll find that there is a lot more to what they are doing, their belief and their behaviour.  It'll be heavily political, it'll have lots of connect to their social economic status in their country and the world as a whole, and an entire history that we're not really privy too as it's not broadcast to us unless we research it ourselves.

Not that I condone their actions by any stretch, but it's always worth considering the deeper reasons of why people do thing, and try not to fall into the trap of creating these imaginary communities to speak of the group as a whole.

&gt; He's come forward and admitted in an interview at a Danish news station that he suffered from anxiety and severe depression and thought about suicide daily. This happened after he got injured, then recovered but got a mysterious illness that made him lose 10kg really fast, obviously he went to the doctors but they didn't know what it was and Nicklas himself began googling his symptoms.
&gt; His googling made him non-stop anxious and ""anxiety of dieing is the term in Danish at least, not sure if you can translate directly). Talked to his parents several times daily but they couldn't help him, neither could his girlfriend or friends. Turned out it was a bacteria of some sort who caused him to lose the weight. The mental repercussions were worse and he started treatment at a psychiatrist, went back to his home in Aalborg and even though he's not playing as well as he was before he left for Aston Villa in the first place, at least he's doing better. More than that, by going public (in Denmark at least, apparently it hasn't gained much attention in Britain) about his mental illness he has gone against the existing stigma in professional football; that some players actually ARE suffering mentally and shouldn't be afraid to admit it and seek help. As of now, MANY pro footballers with a fragile psyche suffers from depression, turn to drinking or even worse commit suicide either during/or after their career.

null,false,immigrantgerrard,null,null,null,"I came here a year ago.

Just some background I am a 19 year old from Bangladesh. I came to the UK to study Civil Engineering in Swansea University. 

First of all, I love the weather! Back home, it's just too warm. I love reading a good book while I can hear the rain hammering the walls outside. 

I love my university, and the opportunities available to me. It's a shabby looking place, but the professors are really excellent. Some of the most advanced research in the world is going on here, and they combine it with the Civil Engineering curriculum very well.

In the company I intern/work at I am also treated very well, paid very well, and respected. I think I have the same opportunities available to me professionally as my white British colleagues.

Socially however, I feel like a bit of an outcast. Don't get me wrong, I have a few friends and am part of various societies, but I always get this feeling like I'm being looked down at. I feel like white immigrants from the EU or America are seen as equal, but whenever I speak up it seems like some people are more quick to put me down.

Furthermore, I always imagined Britain to be a liberal haven, where I could be more myself (Don't get me wrong, I never held my tongue in Bangladesh, but I was aware that it's slightly more conservative). Unfortunately, the UK seems to be more conservative than Bangladesh in many ways. I have read newspapers like the Daily Mail and The Times, and I'm astonished with the way foreigners are characterised. 

Also I don't understand the obsession with drinking. It seems like every social event revolves around drinking. Never mind enjoying each others companies, or doing something fun, getting as fucked up as possible seems to be the end goal of each night out. 

It's hard to make friends in this environment. I do drink myself, but not to such an extent, and because of this often end up going home early and 'missing out' on whatever stupid shit occurred and feel more left out. 

Romance here is particularly difficult as well. In America and Europe, people are big on dating, but I just don't understand how relationships start here? It seems most sexual relationships are formed while inebriated and continue from there. I have had two girlfriends while here. One was Bengali herself, so there was no issue, but with the one English girl I was with, made it clear that she hadn't told her parents about me and was tentative to make our relationship public. I felt this was because she was embarrassed of me (maybe to do with the weird white supremacy thing I talked about earlier on) and yes, I ended that quickly.

Well reading back at what I wrote, it seems I have complained a hell of a lot. Honestly though, Britain isn't half bad, you have excellent infrastructure. I just don't fit in well here, and after I get my qualifications I plan to move to Sweden (already learning the language).",null,0,null,1435958441,null,0,false,0,csrdh89,null,t3_3bzgyk,null,t1_csrdh89,null,t3_3bzgyk,null,null,null,1437562875,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

Of course it is, it can still bite, it still has the power to cause serious damage. The simple case is the owners don't control their pet correctly, simple. 

The most basic training is how to walk a dog, and the sheer amount of people i see walking their dog incorrectly is staggering. They allow the dog to walk them, the lead is taught, the dog is in front, this is encouraging the dog to 'protect' its pack. He is in control, he is at the front of his 'pack'. Simple dog training trains you that a dog should be beside or behind you. By allowing the dog to pull you your encouraging it to be in a defensive stance.

Making a knee-jerk reaction like this would've definitely lead to Ivanvic and Willian being sold 6 months in, and even players like DDG had slow starts.

Let's keep him for a year, see what happens after a pre-season and some time in the gym. [In 14 appearances he's played 343 minutes](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/juan-cuadrado/leistungsdaten/spieler/91970/plus/?saison=2014). That's ~25 minutes per game in the games he even appeared in. That's not enough to build up chemistry with the team, let alone a run of form.

Costa and Fabregas had the benefit of a pre-season with us to adjust, and we had a Matic-shaped hole long before we bought him. Not all players adapt as quickly.

Chelsea also had the least rotation in a squad, and I'd argue the greatest teamwork. Hazard knew when Azpi was making an overlapping run, Matic knew which tackles he had to make and which Terry/Cahill would clear up, and Fabregas knew where Costa would be. You can't plonk a new person down in the middle of that - on the ever-maurading Ivanovic's side, no less - and expect him to instantly click. Look at how long it took Willian, even with more regular games after Schurrle started trying too hard to impress Jose.

Mourinho bought Cuadrado, and how many Mourinho signings have let us down? He doesn't buy on a whim, he always buys exactly who we need/want and for far less than the Manchester Clubs. Chelsea have shrewd businessmen, and to say they fucked up so monumentally that we aren't even going to give him a season under us is quite frankly ludicrous.

The only - and I do mean only - reason Cuadrado would leave now is if he's unhappy at Chelsea. Even then we now have Falcao as another Colombian. The only reports I've seen that Jose doesn't like him come from the *Express* or similar.

I'll shed a little more light on the situation -- I'm not from India (actually never been there in my life) and, for various reasons to do with schooling my accent sounds American/Canadian. British Indians, have, by and large been really friendly and open with me, and it is _these_ interactions that have given me the opinion I have.  

For the first 5 years in the country I spent a heck of a lot of time socialising with BIs and, because they considered me a ""first-world"" Indian, they would share their insights and opinions with me openly, and I must say I was _appalled_ at the way they viewed subcontinent Indians and openly mocked them. I can personally remember changing social groups 4 times because of this bigoted outlook.  I used to wonder whether they make fun of me when I'm not around because I'm turban wearing.  One day I realised that if socialising meant changing groups, constantly wondering and feeling intensely uncomfortable, it's probably better not to.

But I'd like to point out, again, that there's a _huge_ difference between running jokes and actively putting down people. It's a joke if the receiver takes it in good humour, when the receiver gets visibly upset and asks you not to do it and you _purposely_ do so it's just being a bully.  Unfortunately, that's what I saw.   

The _most_ interesting thing to me though was how stressed out all these characters would get if someone outside their circle (say a white person on the street) assumed they (the BIs) were from India. It seemed that a racial comment was more acceptable. 

Again, I stress that not everyone was like this but I saw too many samples to assume it was anecdotal. 

Of course the way Indians have discriminated against you is not right either. 

In conclusion, just as an aside -- I can walk the walk.  I play the Cambridge graduate and the American accent on a daily basis when interacting with people to my advantage.  I often wonder how well I would do with an Indian accent. I'd like to think just as well. 

Interesting comment though, thanks for you insight. ",null,0,null,1435960643,null,0,1435961474,0,csrekr5,null,t3_3bzgyk,null,t1_csrekr5,null,t1_csrcn1z,null,null,null,1437563679,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

One of the main sensations in going from somewhere small, like Estonia, to the UK is that of the breadth of, well, anything and everything. Opportunities, ideas, attitudes, events, as well as actual physical distances have a different level of scale about them. There's just MORE here. More to do, more places to go. And having lived here for a little while and become a fish that no longer sees the surrounding water, going back to my home town in Estonia produces an opposite effect: everything strikes me as slower, smaller, more quiet, infinitely more localised and of much smaller significance.

On a personal level, interacting with people taught me that some commonalities that may very well constitute the ""national character"" are likely to be true. English people are, without a doubt, quite inherently polite (usually). They do have, however, a very clear set of personal interaction boundaries with regards to their social circles. It can take you a lot of time or effort to move, for instance, from the circle of ""work acquaintances"" into ""friends"". This was somewhat of a difficult realisation for me, as where I come from, people tended to form bonds more easily.

This reserved attitude to carefully delimiting which groups of people you associate yourself with is very pervasive, and is reflected quite significantly, I think, in British culture.

And that's the issue.

Fewer and fewer universities own their halls of residence outright. As the buildings that existed became more and more decrepit after the slowdown of funding in the 1990s, and the boom of student numbers in the 2000s, universities found themselves desperately needing to renovate their existing accommodation and build new halls. Most simply couldn't afford it, so instead went to 3rd parties who would build, renovate and run the halls at a profit whilst remaining under the banner of the university itself so this change was not obvious to students.

Many institutions are now realising this was a catastrophic mistake; few universities are blind to the issue of rising accommodation costs. Worse, the need for accommodation is still increasing, and the universities still don't have the funds upfront to build them - that means yet more outsourcing.

The only solution would be to wait for contracts to expire and somehow find the money to buy them back. But with falling per student funding, it doesn't look likely.

tl;dr: most universities don't own their halls, so they can't charge as you suggest.

null,false,Facehammer,null,null,null,"Yes, there are a lot of as-yet untapped resources on Earth. On the whole, though, those resources have not been exploited yet for good reasons: usually that there are lower-hanging fruit elsewhere, or that the environmental, economic or political cost is deemed too high. As I said, we don't neen to go full Mad Max before shortages from the easier sources start bringing these more costly, thorny sources - that we could previously get away with sweeping under the rug - back to the fore. Consider tar sands, shale gas and deep-water oil; normal gas and coal extraction continues, but nobody would ever bother with these more difficult and expensive (and often appallingly destructive and politically toxic) sources if demand could reliably be met just by using more conventional wells.

The people of California would beg to differ that there are no water shortages in Western nations. They could pump in extra water from other states... if the other states are willing to let them have it. Funnily enough, other states are getting pretty tired of sending their water to California, when they would rather use it for their own agriculture - and it's not hard to see why when a lot of it gets pissed up the wall on water-intensive agriculture and golf courses in the middle of the desert. Desalination is expensive to the point that it's something you would want to avoid unless you had no other option. Using it is a sign of desperation rather than effective, rational use of available resources.

The third world is where we *get* most of our resources. Their problem isn't the supply of raw materials, but the lack of advanced manufacturing capability that adds value to those resources. Historically, countries that have heavily industrialised themselves have become a lot richer as a consequence, for exactly that reason. Look at China.

I brought QE up because of what you said earlier about the Greens and ""the money tree"". I probably misunderstood what you meant by that. 

The Nordic countries also have a strong welfare state - high minimum wage, robust social security, high top-level taxes - that probably explains their flatter distribution of wealth a lot better. Without these things, a growing economy can easily be made to more substantially benefit those who are already rich, as I explained earlier. (What I said earlier also explains exactly how the rich disproportionately benefit even when - indeed, *because* - their wealth is constantly circulating in the economy rather than sitting in a vault). Growth doesn't *have* to lead to increasing inequality, but it certainly doesn't stop it. This isn't remotely controversial amongst economists anywhere short of the lunatic fringe.

I won't say that making money by moving it around is inherently a good or bad thing, because there are clearly cases where it is helpful, and given the logic behind why money exists at all, it's probably inevitable to some extent anyway. It's like a knife - a tool that can be used for good or ill. But I will say that governments regulate this behaviour, and forbid certain types of it, for excellent reasons. I don't think efforts to rein in exploitative, destructive or unhelpful financial practices are at all unreasonable, and I doubt you would either if we were to get into their specifics.

We may see zero or negative overall growth in the next century whether anyone likes it or not, since the global population will (probably) level off and begin to decline, and population size is a massive factor in determining the size of the economy.

I would be fine with privatisation provided that it was done because it offers a better deal for the public - cutting costs whilst offering a better quality of service. My issue however is that Kendall seems to lean too far toward the ""deregulate for the sake of deregulation"" angle.

Personally though, I don't actually give a shit about the nationalisation aspect. I care more about a Labour that moves away from supporting excessive state surveillance - I want a Labour that will oppose any and all bills that threaten privacy. 

I care about a Labour that puts the people first - I don't want a Labour that will slash welfare and healthcare just to try and fulfil some imaginary goal of somehow being the only country with a population &gt;1million that doesn't have debt... To me Labour moved on from the classic working-class socialist roots and is now supposed to be the party that is about looking out for the less well off and less fortunate - it's time they start acting like it. I don't give a flying shit about socialism/capitalism and all that nonsense, all I care about is the need for a government that prioritises people getting the help and support they need above all else.

From my perspective, I only give a shit about the economy if the economy is used to then help people.

You want my proof?  Here it is:

Points difference between first and second 204 - 15

Germany:
Bayern Munich 79 - Wolfsburg 69
Difference: 10

Spain:

Juve 87 - Roma 70
Difference: 17

England:
Chelsea 87 - Man City 79
Difference: 8

Scotland:
Celtic 92 - Aberdeen 75
Difference: 17

Average points difference (top-bottom divided by no of teams) season 2014 - 15:

Germany:

No of teams: 18

Spain:

England:
87 - 30
No of teams:20
Average: 2.85

Scotland:
92 - 30
No of teams: 12
Average: 5.12

The only one where Scotland even matches any of the others is the points difference between first and second with Italy.  Hahaha

But, you're right.  Those leagues are not as competitive as the SPL.  The difference is in part quality, but the quality comes from attracting players due to the competitiveness.

null,false,DamienHanrahan,,Belfast,null,"&gt; What has that got to do with anything said? If designated days is a compromise, why have nationalist councils not signed up? 


Ok I'll explain. There are very few councils that fly the flag 365 days a year. If Belfast were to do it, they would be the only council with a large proportion of people who don't recognise the flag but it was still forced on them. If so many councils don't fly it 365 every day, can I ask why it's so important you get to fly the Union Flag every day? If London, Manchester or Liverpool etc etc are satisfied with the Union Flag on designated day why aren't you? And they don't even have large nationalist communities to consider! The real motive here is you want the flag every day to prove some political point and outright stick it to the nationalists. And as for the nationalist councils, that's not what this decision was. This decision was to limit the days that Belfast flew a flag that isolated half of the population. If the Nationalist councils were flying a tricolour then I would agree they should take it down, but apart from that even you must see taking down a flag that divides the population is very different from having no flag at all. That's not the issue. 


&gt; Claiming flying the state flag is intimidatory on the one hand, while telling me I'm 'serially offended' for describing your usage of a term as politically loaded after you admit using it because you ""don't recognise NI""? Er, dead on... 


Let's go over in steps what really happened. 


1.) I say I don't like petty sectarian fighting 


2.) You say I'm wrong because I just used a politically charged term for the North. 


3.) This suggest that you think me calling it the North equates to petty sectarian fighting. 


4.) Imagine if someone blamed you for sectarian fighting for calling it Northern Ireland? You'd laugh right? I'm not saying you got offended by this, I'm just saying you can't say I was offended by later events when you reacted a similar way to this situation? Because I'm sorry, but not allowing loyalists to have their way at all times isn't being 'serially offended' and you're just scrambling for insults to back up your shitty views. 



&gt; Hair splitting. You pay your taxes to the exchequer, receive treatment from the NHS and vote at Westminster and a devolved administration. Whatever the citizenship, we're all resident in the UK and signed up to honouring that. Our flag is the union flag. Your political aspirations may differ from that reality. 



I have an Irish passport. I am literally by definition an Irish person. A Mexican living and staying in the North for two years is going to pay taxes, use the NHS etc etc, but it doesn't make him any less Mexican does it? There's a system in place that we have to go along with, and the republican ideal is removing that, but in the meantime we are 100% Irish. 

And about your earlier points;


&gt; Regarding who exactly supported taking down the flag, the Community Relations Council told the politicians it would have an adverse impact on community relations. How right they were.
&gt; The city's Chamber of Commerce criticised the decision to change flag policy in the run up to Xmas. How right they were.

Not really, but go on.

&gt;The point differences / the number of teams means nothing lol. It actually shows nothing. What does it represent?

It's called showing your working.  Something you'll be asked to do when you sit your Standard Grades.  I've shown you the formula I'm going to use and the figures in question.

&gt;The number of teams in the league is irrelevant, all this shows is this number is greater because it was divided by a smaller number of teams thats actually all it shows lol. Best laugh I've had yet, you just made yourself look like a fanny.

No, the number of teams is extremely relevant.  You clearly don't have a scooby what you're looking at, so I'll explain.  If I just posted the differences between top and bottom, then it would be unfair.  For the reason you gave.  Therefore, I divided that difference by the number of teams to get the average.  If the SPL was as competitive as the other leagues in question then the average would still be around the same as it was for the other leagues.  This is literally how working these things out is done.  You take the average because it's the fairest way of doing this when there are those differences in the number of competitors.

&gt;Points attained/points avaliable for the top and bottom and then the difference shows the competitveness that actual teams involved means nothing because the numbers are skewed by a smaller league number ya fucking muppet. I wasnt aware that I've been debating with a retard.

I haven't used points available, so I'm really not sure where you got that from, unless you're admitting you're making things up you fucking dolt.  Again, the point of using the average is to eliminate the skewing of the number of teams.  But you can't accept that, because it'll bruise your fragile little ego to admit you're in the fucking wrong.

I notice that you've said nothing about the points difference between first and second.  Why is that?  Because it also doesn't support your precious theory?  Awww diddums.  Pull on youir big boy pants, admit you're wrong and have been since midday, or show the legitimate proof of what you've been saying that you claim to have.

&gt;Women have the privilege of not having their motives questioned when they play with children

I guess this one can be explained by the fact that most caught paedophiles are men? Doesn't really change the fact that innocent men are judged and frowned-upon for being nice to children.

And:

&gt; Women have the privilege of being 90% less likely to be homeless

Is this one of the one's you'd say that ""Big Kieth from The Office"" pulled out of his arse? I'll look it up if you want to dispute it, but whatever, I feel like I've made my point.

We could spend all night going through these, but I doubt it will get us anywhere.

You certainly do seem to imagine things - you're putting words in Taylor's mouth. 

Dr Taylor is a big burly man with tattoos, and he seems a very capable scientist. I doubt if he's beaten down by, or ""can't see through"", a few feminist tweets. 

The ""fact that he broke down leads you to believe"" stuff because of your own expectations.

The rocket launch was presumably the culmination of a long period of work, he could've been exhausted. He could have been going through a rough patch with the wife, or have mental health issues - I would have preferred not to speculate on such things.

You see it as the feminists' fault because that's what you want to see. Taylor is a scientist, and I doubt he would encourage you to jump to conclusions on such scanty evidence.

https://www.gov.uk/benefits-calculators

http://www.entitledto.co.uk/benefits-calculator/startcalc.aspx

2. Call the jobcentre and ask them for help setting up some new claims or apply online where possible. 

3. With most disability benefits you will need to fill out a form in as much detail as possible and provide supporting evidence such as a note from your GP and/or medical professional. You will also qualify for housing benefit which should cover your rent. If you struggle with paper work you can contact the 'citizens advice bureau' and they will help you out (https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/). Don't be afraid to go into detail on the form, you get nothing for holding back. 

4. Send off the forms asap as the waiting list is very long, don't assume the DWP know what they are doing, in my experience you have to babysit them every step of the way. You will need to pool all of your resources during this time to survive. Go to a foodbank, cut back on everything, get a crisis loan, eat cheap food from cheap supermarkets,  sell some stuff on gumtree, ebay, musicmagpie or cash for clothes etc...

5. Eventually you will get a letter asking you to go to a ""work capability assessment"". Here is a link to a website which will tell you everything you need to know http://www.benefitsandwork.co.uk/ 

6. If you get the benefits you wanted great, if not DO NOT BE AFRAID TO APPEAL THE DECISION, most people do and go on to win so be sure to not give up without a fight. 

7. No matter how daunted, hopeless and wounded you may feel you are not alone, just like you did here on reddit all you have to do is reach out, DO NOT SUFFER IN SILENCE.

Winning a trophy, especially a european one isn't a walk in the park like most people think in here. 

Rodgers has been awful in Europe and I don't see it improving enough to beat some of the quality teams in the Europa.

Cup tactics are a different ball game to league games. Rodgers has been poor in cup competitions for us, and decent in the league. Rafa for example, was the opposite. 

Before anyone brings up the two semi's we got to last year, we had very easy routes to those semi's and still almost got knocked out by championship sides and lost out to a team that was nearly relegated in the semi-final of the FA cup. 

Bottom line is performances have been almost always dire in cups under Rodgers. 

In my opinion we have a better chance of displacing a straggling member of the top four than winning a trophy.

So I went from having not even ridden a pushbike for the best part of 10 years to getting on a geared 125, with the intention of going on to do DAS.

We did all the basic intro stuff and then went onto the concrete paddock to start riding. I wasn't what you would call a natural, and using the controls for the first time didn't come together very well for me. It was at this point the instructor started swearing and yelling whenever the other new rider and myself (who were the only two on geared 125s) made any mistakes.

The problem with this was that we kept looking at him whenever this happened, and as you can imagine, at several points, this put us on a collision course with him. This made him shout more.

We had some lunch, did the highway code stuff and then it was time for the road ride. The radios were very poor, so I took the approach that if I didn't get an instruction and I was at the front I'd go straight on at whatever junction we arrived at. This was normally wrong: ""What the fuck did I just say????"" would normally follow when this happened.

Of course, I stalled a few times, and he didn't seem to grasp that yelling ""stop panicking, why the fuck are you panicking?"" did nothing to assist me. Across the day the instructor seemed much more keen on telling us what an exceptional rider he was, rather than explaining all the criticism we were on the receiving end of.

Once we were back and parked, as we are walking away from the bikes he yells ""you better not have put the fucking steering locks on on those bikes!"" quite aggressively. I didn't even know bikes had a steering lock at this point.

We get back into the office and somehow I'd passed. No idea how. He then started the ""Who's signing up for DAS?"" pitch. At this point I told him I didn't think biking was for me, took my certificate, and left. He was very taken aback by this. Good.

Key lengths dictate how long it takes to brute force guess a key. Back in the day you weren't allowed to export encryption software with a key length of more than 40 bits.

It doesn't matter how super-amazing your crypto is if it only takes a week to work through every possible key.

Chrome UK would only permit 40 bit keys. Or longer given modern standards. but whatever the UK can confidently break in under a week given their current tech ability.

I'm surprised and disappointed by your experience.

&gt; There is no desire to take it further and in more than one instance I've had partners leave me because parents, family or friends looked down on their dating a non-native.

On the flipside an English friend of mine was engaged to an Indian-born Hindu, but it had to be kept on the quiet because of his family. He refused to introduce her to them for several years, which became a huge issue for her, and when he finally did they were completely disgusted, and forbade the marriage due to her not being an Indian Hindu. Eventually they broke up because of it. 

The Sikh friend I mentioned has had to keep her white boyfriends secret from her parents because they only want her to be with a Sikh - born not just in India, but in the suburb where she's from.

We are a stable team that constantly win. He won't be under constant pressure to win us games like when he was at Man U. Don't forget there midfielders were hopeless. It is not like they were creating lots of chances for him. At Chelsea, he would at least get lots of opportunities to score goals. The likes of Hazard and Fabregas will be creating opportunities for him. Unlike Torres, he never depended on his pace to score goals.

Manchester City were given the green light to spend heavily on Raheem Sterling and their other top targets after Uefa removed its restrictions on transfers and wages imposed as part of its Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules.

City‚Äôs second offer of up to ¬£40 million for the England forward was rejected, but the club will be in a stronger position to raise their bid closer to Liverpool‚Äôs asking price of ¬£50 million. Manuel Pellegrini is also confident of being able to sign Kevin de Bruyne, who is likely to cost ¬£35 million, despite Wolfsburg wanting to offer their Belgium midfielder a new contract. The City manager has not given up hope of bringing in Paul Pogba, the Juventus midfielder.

Uefa‚Äôs restrictions curtailed City‚Äôs transfer spending to ¬£49 million last summer and effectively caused the club to freeze their wages as a punishment for breaching FFP rules amid the threat of further sanctions. City will also be free to name a full 25-man squad for the Champions League, having had to name a reduced squad of 21, five of whom had to be home-grown players, last season.

‚ÄúWe dealt with the pinch last year from financial fair play, whether you agree with it or not. It‚Äôs behind us and we are out of it now,‚Äù Khaldoon al-Mubarak, the City chairman, said last month.

City avoided being fined ¬£14 million of Champions League prize money from last season after staying within spending limits, and agreed not to increase the value of some sponsorship deals with partners from Abu Dhabi as well as excluding the sale of some assets in its break-even calculations.

Uefa says that City will remain ‚Äúunder strict monitoring‚Äù and that the sanctions are lifted subject to additional controls and audits. ‚ÄúThey have still to meet break-even targets and are therefore subject to some limitations in 2016,‚Äù a Uefa statement said.

I also love *Alan Partridge*, but it doesn't translate quite as well (it is more British). Try the movie first, which is a silly delight.  I feel like Americans can't do that kind of comedy today, at least in movies.

If you want to go old school and watch ""THE best spy series in television history,"" according to the NY Times, it is all about *The Sandbaggers* and the cold war.  You probably need to like espionage, hopefully Le Carre, etc., but this show was the best thing ever (approx 1978-80).  And it was terminated because its real spy creator disappeared in a plane under mysterious circumstances.  I'm not kidding.  And, the work he did is still not declassified even though normally it would be just because of the amount of time that has past.  Best Show!!

Netflix, a while back at least, had edited versions to fit US commercials for the first seasons.  That is fine to try out the show, but if you like it, be sure to find the 60 minute versions.

Their Tea Tree toner was overpriced considering you can get similar in Superdrug for cheaper. Eau Roma toner is nice, it's a little too fragranced for my taste though (that says a lot, fragrance hardly ever bothers me in skincare).

null,false,BasedRafiki,null,null,null,"Depends what you want to do with it? You could have all sorts of potentially fatal weapons in your house - knives, bats, mallets. Having those things in your house is fine, to the best of my knowledge. It's when you use them that things get murky. 

You've got something called ""reasonable force"". The problem with reasonable force is that it's not black and white. We know court rulings aren't *always* reasonable. The justice system isn't infallible. So I would be very careful using anything that could be easily fatal. One because you don't need a fatal weapon with your run of the mill burglar. Two because do you really want to chance imprisonment? 

Cricket and baseball bats sound good in theory but I doubt they'd be all that practical in small rooms and narrow corridors. Not much swinging room and parrying and grabbing them isn't all that difficult. 

I don't know if it's normal but I sometimes scan the room and wonder what I could grab for self defence if push came to shove. 

In theory I reckon a heavy duty cast iron frying pan is just the right size, shape and weight to be used effectively in small quarters. 

It's heavy enough to be potentially deadly if dealing with an out and out psychopath. But it's also versatile. If we're just talking your run of the mill crackhead trying to steal your toaster and old VHS tapes, just give him a taste; one half swing should do it. 

If you're looking to buy something I'd personally go for a deterrent. Alarm systems. Possibly cameras. A guard dog would be a big help if you're a dog person.

An airsoft gun that looks like an old handgun might be a good deterrant for confronting an intruder. Whether they'd buy it or not I don't know. You can get heavy air soft guns though. Just Rick Ross 'em up the side of the head if they're feeling lucky.

He won't stop getting called up because he plays well and scores centrally and can be played out wide if necessary. 14 in 33 is a good record for a striker and he offers a lot more besides. Most national teams aren't set up to protect against a powerful and quick striker who can and does drop very deep when he needs to. Second, I'm not saying Austin would be happy as a sub, I'm saying he shouldn't and I don't think he will use the potential for England call-ups to inform his decision on where to go. He has a chance but it's not big. Sturridge when fit is 100% in the England squad, Kane probably is now as well and with Ings at Liverpool, Walcott playing more centrally for Arsenal, Welbeck always being a viable option and Berahino putting up great numbers while being much younger and Rooney being irreplaceable, I just don't see Austin asserting himself over the competition unless they all suddenly turn to shit and he has an amazing season.

&gt; Something doesn't feel right on this site right now. I'm not jumping to any conclusions about some bit cabal or anything like that, but it just feels odd.
&gt; 
&gt; Blowing this up to an issue of oppression or censorship is childish hyperbole, but that's the Internet for you. That doesn't mean their points can't be valid.
&gt; 
&gt; Staffing changes and reorganizations are common around this time of the year. I know, because I got caught up in one three years ago today, in fact.
&gt; 
&gt; Should the admins, et al have been more transparent about their moves in the first place? Sure, in a perfect world that's how it goes. But there are plenty of employment laws that prevent employers from discussing details of employee termination. There probably wasn't a good way for them to announce this without firing up a shitstorm, anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; But between this and what happened to Kickme444 in r/secretsanta, this does raise some serious concerns about what is happening with the site.
&gt; 
&gt; Subreddits are starting to come out of their blackouts, and some, like /r/iama are pointing out that the abrupt changes are forcing them to take drastic action, including keeping the admins out of the discussion for arranging ama's (I agree with them on this, because if they're going to shaft you this abruptly, it's right not to trust them so quickly with something important).
&gt; 
&gt; Is right now the time to go dark for us? I'm saying no. We're not in the middle of a season, we're still in light rumor mode with no release date or actual trailer for the next season. We aren't exactly known for our AMAs (despite our efforts to corral them in the future), so going dark over what happened to Victoria doesn't make much sense.
&gt; 
&gt; However, it would be good to keep an eye on things, especially over the holiday weekend, and how Reddit handles what happens with /r/iama's move today. Just because now isn't the right time to go dark, doesn't mean we shouldn't consider it in the near future.

null,false,SuperFLEB,null,null,null,"Well, as an American who watches a lot of British TV (I'm a cordcutter, it's unblocked in the US on YouTube-- match made in heaven), here's my usual roster.

Caveats:

* These aren't suggestions. I'm terrible with suggestions, and that's too much pressure. This is just a brain dump of what I watch.
* Listed in the order that I thought of listing them.
* There's a fair bit of older stuff here, since it's easier to come by, and I tend to find someone I like and dig into their past shows.
* YouTube links were mostly done by searching it and a quick look-see-click. I don't think there're any deceptive bait links (y'know, the kind that say ""Episode of show"", but are actually a video trying to link you to a sketchy video-download site), but don't quote me on that. Links work in the US.
* I use YouTube, Hulu+, and Netflix-- shows might be available elsewhere, but I wouldn't know.

---

So, the shows I watch...

* I'm a big [Charlie Brooker](/r/CharlieBrooker) fan. In the past few years, he's done a number of (mostly similar) shows where he cynically talks about the mass-media. Think *Talk Soup*, only grumpier. If you're into sarcasm, there're few out there that do it better.
 * I'd first caught wind of his work when someone linked to ***How TV Ruined Your Life*** [YouTube](https://youtu.be/jqeBcvHhA9M). Some people say it's not Brooker's best work, but I still call it my personal favorite (I'm probably a bit biased since that was the first I'd seen, and I'll admit *Screenwipe* was probably objectively better).
 * If you find that you like that, also try ***Screenwipe*** [YouTube](https://youtu.be/3whHmKPfkFQ?list=PLC8D41E8639DDA6BB). It's a bit dated, but still has some funny and interesting insight into TV production.
 * For something more current, watch for ***Weekly Wipe*** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp0wkDYlNvVssPwft0vKEfg). It's the same format as the previous ones, but it's recent and currently running. Note that this show is a bit more locally-topical, so you might not catch all the context unless you're at least a bit up on British politics or pop culture.
* Did I mention I'm a squealing Charlie Brooker fanboy? He's also done some fictional drama and comedy as well. These are harder to find decent copies of on YouTube. The high seas, the sketchy back-alleys of the Web, or overseas shipping are your best bet to find these.
 * ***Black Mirror*** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=black+mirror)/[Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/title/70264888)/[Reddit](/r/BlackMirror) - *Drama, Sci-fi* - (Link goes to a search query because it's rather scattershot) is an exceptionally good sci-fi sort of show. It's described as the ""Twilight Zone"" or ""Outer Limits"" of the 21st Century, and rightly so. While it's not the same '50s morality plays, it's the same formula of examining a contemporary anxiety by way of metaphorically-related speculative fiction.
 * ***A Touch of Cloth*** (No link, as it's hard to find a complete set on YT) - *Parody* - I don't know if this is a contentious opinion or not, but I'd argue that this is less a British comedy, than a British person making an American-style comedy. In short, this is *Police Squad* for the *CSI* generation. It's got the gag-a-minute rapid-fire of a Zucker Brothers flick, and it lampoons the modern police procedural quite well. Given the rest of Brooker's work, this is an outlier, but if you like *The Naked Gun* style movies, it's definitely one to check out.
 * ***Dead Set*** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjrP6KN-rKaXXsEjQ2X4kDOJefcIFtra3) - *Parody* - I wasn't *as* fond of this show, but it wasn't terrible. The premise is basically that a *Big Brother* cast, given their isolation, are some of the few left after a zombie plauge, and they're all awful, shallow idiots.

Okay, enough about Brooker...

* ***Life on Mars*** [Hulu+](http://www.hulu.com/life-on-mars-uk) and ***Ashes to Ashes*** [Hulu+](http://www.hulu.com/ashes-to-ashes) - *Drama/Sci-Fi-ish/Period* - Is it good? Well, these two shows are the reason I got a Region 2-capable DVD player^([1]). So, yes, that's my ringing endorsement. *Life on Mars* follows a police officer who gets hit by a car and is inexplicably sent back to 1973. From what I've heard it's more dramatic than accurate, but the period representation is done well enough to be seamless and fade into the background, it's got ham-fisted action and 1970s style, while still staying grounded enough to be dramatic, and it's odd and twisty enough to satisfy a quirk-lover like me. *Ashes to Ashes* sends another police officer back to 1981 to meet (most of) the same gang from *Life on Mars*. While it risks being ""more of the same"", it transcends by bringing its own style, and gets into its own stride by the middle of the first season, and is a suitable cap-off to the story started in *Life on Mars*.
* ***That Mitchell and Webb Look*** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5sw-RQotrk&amp;list=PLE69C63011FFA1BFB) [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/that-mitchell-and-webb-look) - *Sketch Comedy* - A solid sketch-comedy show from some of the best. If you like sketch comedy, I heartily recommend it. (You're likely to see some things you've heard referenced.)
* ***Peep Show*** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB94AEA21B9EB7BD6)/[Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/title/70217140)/[Hulu+](http://www.hulu.com/peep-show) - *Sitcom* - This is a sitcom starring the aforementioned Mitchell and Webb. The gimmick here is that it's ""through the eyes of the characters"", but IMO, that gets old and eventually fades into the background anyway. As a show, it's pretty funny and solidly made, though I haven't been watching it as much just because there's *so damned much* of it, and I can't find the time to binge up to current-day.
* ***Ambassadors*** [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/ambassadors) - *Comedy, but with a bit of drama* - Yet *another* Mitchell and Webb vehicle, this one kind of wobbles all over the place on a solid ground of comedy, but unsure if it wants to toss drama in there as well. That said, I still keep it around and watch it every now and then, 'cause it's got quite a few good lines and moments, and is still solidly entertaining.

And of course, what would a British TV round-up be without panel shows?

* ***QI*** [YouTube, latest series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPSQpEKGSh2Aze_jUEvk9Bgd-tipT48ew)/[Hulu, older series](http://www.hulu.com/qi) - And what list of panel shows would be complete without QI? It's a general-knowledge quiz where all the panelists are comedians so they don't know the answers anyway.
* ***Never Mind the Buzzcocks*** [YouTube, Latest season ep. 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWQbmDNMX2U) - This show has been going on for far longer than I've been watching it, so of course according to all the oldsters, I apparently missed out on all the best ones. Well, I'm here to tell you that the last season wasn't all that great, I liked the guest-host seasons more, and apparently they've ended the show, so all hope is lost. Here, have [my personal favorite episode with Richard Ayoade of *The IT Crowd*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YUh6soykdU), and [my second-favorite episode with Jack Whitehall fawning over Kriss Akabusi, who's filling in for Aston Merrygold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SZrBWo9Xyk).
* ***Big Fat Quiz of the Year*** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rx3RwwakAA) - The panel-show culmination of the year. They're usually pretty funny.

Then there're a few that I'm not over the moon about, but I'll watch them if they're on (my YouTube feed). Meh, I'm just not *that* into game shows:

* ***Would I Lie To You?*** [YouTube](https://youtu.be/C8BygaZXsj4?list=PLZG-b_LXDywLCpVOoV047CDUSXRdGXBZx) - *Panel/Game* - A panel/game show with comedians and celebrity guests. One player has to read off a fact about themselves that they've been given, and the others must determine whether it's true or not.
* ***Have I Got News For You*** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86ERSi5tjts) - *Panel* - Guests play something resembling a game, but mostly just bullshit over topical news events. It's topical, so it's a bit opaque until you can follow along with British news and politics.
* ***Mock the Week*** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCjQ5PI6irU) - *Panel* - Basically you could just copy the same description from *Have I Got News For You* in for *Mock The Week*. On paper they're the same sort of thing. MtW has a bit less on-topic and more general-comedy feel, as well as freeform segments that stray from the topics of the day.
* ***8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown*** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdSXSfc1aNs) - *Panel/Game* - A spinoff and mash-up putting the cast of *8 out of 10 Cats* (a show where panelists attempt to answer questions about public-opinion polls, though that's not brought through in this show) and various comedians into a game of *Countdown* (a game where people try to put together numbers and letters to make sums and long words, respectively). The usual panel-show format of ""put comedians on a game show where nobody really pays attention to about the score"", though it's building off an established game-show^([2]).

You can tell he was getting himself to start pressing towards the later stages of the season - but it wasn't nearly enough. For someone with Balotelli's athleticism and explosive strength, I don't think I've ever seen him at a full sprint.

He'll chase, but it'll be a half-assed effort. He'll maybe go up for a header, but he'll barely try to win it. That's what strikes me as Balotelli being ""lazy."" It's not that he won't move -- because fucking hell, he has to run at least a little -- but that he does things half-heartedly.

Combine that with the fact that in order to play him, our system needs to adapt *to him* specifically? I won't be sad to see him go.

If our game is supposed to be based on intensity, I don't see why we need a Berbatov-esque, lackadaisical player on the pitch. If we're looking for creativity, that's why we have Firminho, Coutinho, Lallana. We should be fielding 2 strikers if we are guaranteed that they are both chipping in with goals. Otherwise, with the players we're looking to have, I really feel that Balotelli is a 4th or 5th choice forward... behind Sturridge, behind Benteke (maybe), behind Firminho, behind Ings.

We could move him on and replace him with some who would fit at Liverpool. Maybe there were some personal issues that affected him, maybe playing in a system that doesn't align with his strengths as a striker, maybe he didn't combine with sterling, coutinho or lallana like sturridge.

my opinion is that he is a good player, theres no doubt about that.
he did look good playing up top with sturridge when we beat tottenham 3-0 at the start of the season so there is hope for him to come good.

whether or not he has the mentality to earn his place and fight for team is something i question.

Germany - 4/5 league titles Byern Munich
Italy - 4/5 titles Juventus
France- 3/5 titles PSG
Spain - 9/10 titles Barca/Real (Doubled because of 2 teams)
England - last 11 titles split between 3 teams, Man City, Utd and Chelsea.
Scotland - 4/5 Celtic

My arguement being leagues with the same constant winners 
are not competitive.  Which I stand by.

You then rebuffed by saying, actually competitiveness is based on how close the teams are, which is an acceptable stance except the calculation you are using to prove that stance is wrong and is still wrong and you wont change it.

Thats where we stand.

Until you go away and do a proper calculation using a points per game system then the conversation is over. The best bit is I didnt read any of the links I post to you, but I have now.

Doing it this way means not only that you have more time in the evenings, but also that you can escape the constant 'work guilt' that plagues every hour of the day and is generally worse than the actual work. 

But don't stress about doing essays as soon as you get them- a lot of the time you haven't been given the material to do them yet and it's a much more effective use of your time to wait until you've had the lectures. Use that time to read ahead on anatomy or something.

It was clear that the group was too large and they didn't have many instructors so the car park training didn't finish until around 17:00 by which time everyone was completely knackered, I wasn't even really happy with my control of the bike as they weren't really teaching anything just letting us go about.. they had us doing things like the emergency stop for example saying if it was ok or not.. but not why so every time I did it wrong I had no idea what the issue was.

Just in time for the on road section it starts raining.. typical.  We head out and my inexperience and lack of proper instruction shows pretty quickly.. I am dumping the clutch.. wrong gears.. leaving indicators on etc.  The fat guy is literally screaming at me down the one way radio.  It is good it is one way as I had a few choice words for him.

Beats me down all the way through it then we get back to the test centre and he is like well I wasn't going to pass you but seeing as there was some improvement I will..

I went out the next day on my 125 and rode perfectly, it is amazing how much having someone shouting at you for hours is very distracting.

&gt;Are you from the Mugabe school of economics?

Its called Keynesianism pretty standard economic theory.

&gt;Banks use fractional reserve banking to ""create"" money

The money multiplier model described in economics textbooks is outdated and incorrect because of three false assumptions:

That a bank needs deposits before it can make a loan.
That the Government can control the amount of money created by the banking sector by altering the reserve ratio and amount of ‚Äòbase money‚Äô in circulation.
The amount of money created by banks is mathematically limited (based on the previous 2 assumptions).
Point 1 is really crucial because this leads to all kinds of misunderstandings. Under the current system, banks don‚Äôt work as middlemen between savers and borrowers and do not need deposits before they make a loan. 

Charles Goodhart said over 20 years ago that the Money Multiplier is ‚Äúsuch an incomplete way of describing the process of the determination of the stock of money that it amounts to mis-instruction‚Äù. 

The term ‚Äòfractional reserve banking‚Äô is also confusing, because it is used quite freely to describe different things. Some people might say that fractional reserve banking is based on this money multiplier model, where banks retain a percentage of their deposits as reserves. *This model doesn‚Äôt exist in reality*,  therefore banks are no longer operating under a fractional reserve banking system. However other people might say if banks are only able to repay a fraction of their depositors at any time, then this is ‚Äòfractional reserve banking‚Äô, so we still have a fractional reserve system. 

&gt; QE is not that at all. It's done by creating money which has the absolute and certain effect of reducing the value of that currency. It's simply taking percentage of money from absolutely everybody and the people that lose the most are people on benefits, poor people etc.

Banks create money to buy assets all the time, it is one reason house prices are so high. It is inflationary and is one reason house prices have been so inflated, it is bad for the poor, and this proposal by the greens is much better than the current system as we don't have to pay interest on the money.

You are extremely rude as well as totally and utterly wrong I have been studying economics at University for over 5 years.

Get it soaking wet. Like truly soak the bastard in cold water.

Ring it out over the sink, get rid of the excess water so it doesn't drip everywhere.

Then drape it over your shoulders across your back.

It isn't as elegant or effective as a beefy A/C unit but it definitely helps. It will stay cold for hours and you can ""refill"" it whenever you want.

&gt;&gt;*See also: [List of Ashes series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ashes_series) for a full listing of all the Ashes series since 1882.*

&gt;* ¬† Won by Australia: 123 (39.2%)

&gt;* ¬† Won by England: 103 (32.8%)

&gt;* ¬† Matches drawn: 88 (28.0%)

&gt;A team must win a series to gain the right to hold the Ashes. A drawn series results in the previous holders retaining the Ashes.

&gt;Ashes series have generally been played over five Test matches, although there have been four-match series (1938; 1975) and six-match series (1970‚Äì71; 1974‚Äì75; 1978‚Äì79; 1981; 1985; 1989; 1993 and 1997).

&gt;68 series have been played, with Australia winning 32 and England 31. The remaining five series were drawn. As of December 2013 [update], the win‚Äìloss ratio in Ashes Tests  (from 1882) stands at 126 wins for Australia to 103 wins for England, with 88 draws. 

&gt;In the 130 years since 1883, Australia have held the Ashes for approximately 76.5 years, and England for 53.5 years.

&gt;Australians have made 264 [centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket\)) in Ashes Tests, of which 23 have been scores over 200, while Englishmen have scored 212 centuries, of which 10 have been over 200. Australians have taken 10 [wickets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket) in a match on 41 occasions, Englishmen 38 times.

For football, [Channel 4](http://www.channel4.com/programmes/nfl-american-football-live) shows the Sunday night game for free every week and usually has a highlights show, too. What's available depends on who has what rights, and that varies by season. The Super Bowl is always on one of the free channels.

If you want something more in-depth, you can subscribe to [NFL Gamepass](http://gamepass.nfl.com/), which can be a bit expensive, but gives you so much coverage. You get 24 hour [NFL Network](http://www.nfl.com/nflnetwork), almost every regular season game live (except the two or three per week which Sky buy the rights to, which you have to wait 24 hours for). All games are archived, too. Oh, and RedZone, which is basically insane and a way to watch every live game at once.

For baseball, you can subscribe to [MLB.TV](http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/subscriptions/index.jsp) which is slightly cheaper and gives you every single game, including the post-season, live and also archived. Just being an MLB.tv member without paying gives you access to [one live free game per day](http://mlb.mlb.com/mediacenter/index.jsp?c_id=mlb), but don't expect it to be Red Sox at Yankees. If you're happy with highlights, MLB posts a whole load of stuff on its [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MLB/videos) every day.

null,false,Yaverland,null,null,null,"English Lit. The best thing I did, beyond the obvious actually doing my work, was to carefully read the course handbook and make sure I understood the rules on how degree classifications would be determined. 

My degree didn't just require a straight average of above 70%. If you had a lower average but half your units taken in second and third years were graded as firsts, that would be enough. Having screwed up much of my second year, I thought I was out of contention. Once I knew I had a chance I really knuckled down. I must have been the only person doing the readings towards the end.

Another thing to do is to make sure you really understand what good work looks like (particularly important if you are doing an essay subject). Go to relevant tutors and talk about your project and what you can do to improve it before it is handed in. A study group is a good idea - you get to see the habits of other successful people, motivate each other, get other people to check your work, and crib hints and tips about the subject matter. In your edit, you say you don't have many people on your course who are your friends. This doesn't matter. You don't want to study with friends because they will distract you. You want to study with people who are talented and good at the subject. Try to identify people who are high performers and driven to do well and try to get a study group going with them. They will turn up by themselves because they are already motivated. I recognise it can be scary trying to get people you don't know to do things but you want to be successful, and successful people reach out to people who can help them, and surround themselves with people on the same mission as them.

Both are just fantastic. 

Luther is a gritty cop show about a brilliant yet troubled detective but it's just so much more than that. One of my favourite aspects on the rare occasion it appears in a show is realism. Genuine, honest emotion, situations, reactions. I'd say Luther does this a bit but Utopia does this more. 

Utopia is a conspiracy drama. David fincher is actually doing a version for HBO and on the wiki page he said he loves the honesty of it and the characters. It's a show with great visuals, relateable characters. *No spoilers ahead, all first episode stuff* It starts off talking about a comic book called the Utopia manuscript which its cult following have different takes on. They're not sure if it's real, madeup or what. It turns out there's a second Utopia manuscript, a sequel, unpublished. The fans obviously want to get a hold of it and one does and offers to share it with a select group of other fans. But two men also want to get ahold of it for unknown motives at first and are willing to go to brutal lengths to get it. The acting is terrific. 

A new show that is only 3 episodes in so far is **Humans**. Apparently it's on AMC too but it's set in the UK and made by the same channel that made Utopia, as well as AMC. Similar feel to Utopia in a sense but different subject. It's about ""synthetics"", android service robots. It also follows a group of a human and 4 synthetics with AI, which no other synthetic has, when they are split up. One ending up in a family's home. That part of the show follows the synthetic in its role in the family.

Edit: **Misfits**. Think heroes but realistic. A bunch of young offenders are doing community service when a freak lightning storm hits and they get powers. They don't go and become heroes but do pretty much what you'd expect them to do and go about their lives, encountering others affected by the storm and having funny stories.

You can rank immigrants from good to bad - somebody who had gained an excellent qualification and spent three years or more integrating with English society = Good. An ex-criminal from Romania with no real skills = bad. A hate-preaching jihadist = worse. To say that one is better than the others (which is unarguably true) does not imply that everything else is bad. 

We don't impose migration caps because our country is literally full (our overall population density is high relative to many countries, but for instance London is much lower density than comparable cities and so are most other cities). Our concerns are: (i) infrastructure is expensive and time consuming and can only keep up with a certain growth rate (ii) people that integrate poorly can cause tension and resentment, whether rightly or wrongly (iii) we don't really want huge amounts of unskilled labour because those workers are most likely to suffer from additional competition. Somebody who has just graduated from Cambridge is likely to be far less damaging in each of those categories than the vast majority of migrants, and is a worthwhile exception. To varying degrees, so is everybody from any university who is able to secure a graduate job and wants to stay. 

Your final paragraph is pure fantasy. Cambridge is not just a place for English students to get taught. It has a huge research function, and benefits hugely from having the brightest people from all over the world apply, as well as the subsequent cross-pollination of ideas at all levels. If you cut off Cambridge from the international community it would be a hell of a lot less successful. International students more than pay their way and help subsidise British students. The limits on Cambridge's size are money and adequately able students. If the number of wealthy and intelligent international students applying increased, it can grow - and if they go down then it won't magically take on way more English students.

&gt;The Sikh friend I mentioned has had to keep her white boyfriends secret from her parents because they only want her to be with a Sikh - born not just in India, but &gt;in the suburb where she's from.

You raise some interesting points, I've coalesced and reordered point 1 and 3 and will address them together.  In my opinion it's easier for females to fit in. In my observation females seem to be a lot better at the ""softer"" things in life, better at reading character, emotions, etc and so their self-selection seems to be of a higher quality.  Coupled with the fact that (in my opinion) the selection criteria for choosing a mate is intrinsically different between males and females, it seems to be easier for females to fit in.  

I knew a girl once (he says with whimsy) that I was so going to _wife_, of ginger hair and eyes of sapphire (sorry for the poetry).  Anyway, I had been dating her for a year and half, took her home one day when she was feeling ill, she went upstairs, to lie down.  As I was leaving, her parents sat me down and told me I'm not worthy of her as I'm turban wearing, but please not to tell their daughter about this conversation and that they will never bring it up again regardless of what I do.  You can imagine how that ended. I can count 4 occasions off the top of my head where I was hot and heavy with English women but it never went beyond private settings.  3 of them explicitly told me it was due to the friends-and-family aspect. 

&gt;There is no desire to take it further and in more than one instance I've had partners leave me because parents, family or friends looked down on their dating a non-&gt;native.

Your anecdote is a little confusing.  I'm assuming you mean English Born Indian Hindu? Yeah, can't say I'm surprised.  In many cases the ""superiority"" complex extends to parents too.

NZ totally delivers on the fewer people thing. I started in the capital, Wellington, and even that is pretty quiet compared to most UK cities. After that I moved super rural. No traffic, no street lights. Just mountains, beaches and fields and forest in-between.

&gt; our universities are there for us

You have no idea what you are talking about. British universities lose money on every British student they teach. A few universities (e.g. Oxbridge, Imperial) can make this up by research grants or endowments. All the rest rely on international students, who pay 50-200% more in tuition fees, in order to subsidise the Brits. However, the government sets a maximum quota of international students on undergraduate courses, so no British 18-year old has ever been denied a place because of an international student.

The result is a divergence between postgraduate and undergraduate courses. More and more British students are taking postgraduate courses, partly because there are more and more international postgrads to subsidise them. Undergrad numbers have not risen in the same way, because of the quota. They are stuck at about the 50% (of 18-year olds) level that was set and achieved by the Blair government.

Those international students are also important economically. Most of your food, some of your fuel, and all of your smartphone (except the CPU design) is imported. How do we pay for that? Big factories in Manchester? Not since the 1920s. Big finance in London? That is very important, but we've seen the downsides of living like a parasite. Educating people who go back home to develop their countries? That's an honest way for the nation to earn a living and in the late 2000s education was about 5% of UK exports.

It was a great experience, but I am considering moving back to Northern Ireland which is where I grew up.

Strasbourg itself is beautiful and every weekend I could explore a new European city or do various outdoor pursuits without having to worry too much about the weather! 

The downsides though were how much more expensive everything was compared to England and especially Northern Ireland! Every Time you went grocery shopping or paid your rent you felt shafted. 
The other issue I had were the French themselves. Strasbourg is right beside Germany and there's a lot of Germans still living the city and I never met a single German I didn't like. 

But the French were something else entirely...
They were some nice French people I met and I made friends with a few but even they made it very clear to me that I am a foreigner and constantly ridiculed my French (which granted is far from perfect) but it was never any type of constructive criticism they'd literally just laugh in my face. It made it very hard to feel included and often times the French would from their own clinique groups whereas the Germans would make an effort to include you. Other small things were when going for coffee the owner would give the French people a biscuit with their coffee but not me or other foreigners. Or when shopping the owner would be visibly nicer to other French people.

Then there's this bizarre anal attitude of French people in power the amount of hops you have to jump through. For example I had to write a letter to cancel my phone contract, I had ten pages of forms after seeing a doctor, only being allowed to go to one select branch of my bank. Waiting in the heat for two hours at an outdoor museum while the curator stared at me while eating his lunch break and then at exactly 2 p.m. being given an annoyed wave to say I could go through a small gap in the wall beside his guard box. 

In my experiences Northern Ireland the people are just so much nicer and a lot more flexible and human with the rules.

I apologise if this is offensive to any French people, but this has unfortunately been my experience, and also sadly that of a majority of my friends who've visited me and France.

&gt; ITT: ""Dembele doesn't score a ton of goals, therefore he's useless.""

&gt; We were at our best (Decemberish - February) with Dembele at CAM, no one can deny that. He could hold up the ball long enough without getting crowded out or losing possession, and Eriksen on the left had much more time to compose himself and influence the game. We've looked toothless since Dembele was benched in March.

&gt; This sub is so fickle and ripe with double standards:

&gt; * Dembele doesn't score enough despite not really being bought to be a goal scorer, but we're fine with Eriksen/Lamela/Townsend/Soldado almost never scoring lately. 
* In the pivot we still expect him to score, but we never hold Mason and Bentaleb to those same standards. 
* We think his lack of chance-creating passes and through balls is a deal breaker, but praise Bentaleb for being a cog in the machine and not making risky passes in favor of keeping possession.
* His ability to hold the ball under pressure is amazing but not apparently worth it, yet every time we see Eriksen crowded out at CAM we bemoan our luck to continue losing possession in the middle.
* On a similar note, he has amazing ability to hold on to the ball and give others around him time to get involved in the play, and then wonder why Kane's looked so isolated since Dembele was benched.

&gt; Seriously, I hate reading comments in threads like this. On his day, the guy is one of our best, toughest, and most reliable players. He's stuck with the club through several managers, done his job, is very popular in the dressing room, and I dare say is highly entertaining to watch when in his groove. He deserves so much better than our fans' constant obsession with the idea that he's only good if he's ""prolific"".

There are a couple of new excuses people have thrown up here though:

&gt; He is gassed at half time when he starts.

Complete and utter bullshit. We would not have signed him if this were true. Not only bullshit, but not even something you can measure without actually asking him (which, I guess unverifiability might be part of the reason behind saying this).

&gt; only turns up for a couple of days per season

Also complete and utter bullshit. He turned up for the time he was given (Decemberish - February), which were our three busiest and most consistent/successful/prolific/whatever months. Then he had one bad game, and got benched indefinitely.

&gt; but there's just some biggish holes in his playing style that need to improve in order to justify him playing regularly

That just about sums up this sub's argument against him: vague, and vocalizing their agreement with some obscure notion that Dembele has dealbreaker issues.

He absolutely gets to ask questions if Poch really hasn't given any reason for why he's benched despite good performances. He *is* better than Mason and Bentaleb (sorry fanboys). This reminds me of the shit AVB would do, where he'd just freeze out certain players without any sort of communication.

Also, anyone yearning for ""Fulham Dembele"", I invite you to compare the people around him there to the people around him now. I daresay he would've been MOTM many times during his starting spell had Kane not been lights out. Oh did I mention Dembele played a huge role in that, and Kane's looked isolated ever since because Eriksen can't hold the ball for 2 seconds before getting crowded out in the middle?

I digress, and invite the members of this sub to have an honest conversation about players where criticism comes with specific, verifiable examples and not just accept the Dembele-has-issues bandwagon. It's the same hive mind mentality that leads to misinformed, cherrypicked opinions this sub likes to form about other players (namely Danny fucking Rose)",null,0,null,1436004868,null,0,1436005724,0,csruh6m,null,t3_3byrpk,null,t1_csruh6m,null,t3_3byrpk,null,null,null,1437575473,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

&gt; it's nothing to do with money, it's to do with taking the best quality students that they can get given the number of Lecturers and teaching researchers they have.

The beginning and end of the sentence contradict each other. If Cambridge get more money, they're not going to spend all of it on wine and choirboys, they're going to hire more teaching staff. During the late 80s and early '90s, Oxford had an outright ban on creating any new university posts because of the cuts imposed by Thatcher; hiring only resumed with the start of the international postgrad boom. 

In fact, if Oxbridge had *only* international students, they could have chosen to expanded much more. However, the British government limited their size as part of the quota system for *British* students until the Coalition reformed the quota system. Now, Oxbridge institutions are quite conservative and I don't think they want to get much bigger because existing colleges are space-constrained and it takes a lot of money to endow a new college until the end of the world. But that still makes money is part of the issue.

There are other financial implications too.  For example, Cambridge was given US$210m by Bill and Melinda Gates which is exclusively for international students. It would be illegal for them to give that money directly to Brits, but the higher fees charged to international students mean that it does subsidise British students. The Rhodes Scholarships at Oxford work in a similar way.

&gt; That design, research and economy should be here, we shouldn't be educating students so that they can then go back to their countries to bring prosperity, we want prosperity here. 

It's not a zero sum game. Look, if Samsung decide to make more smartphones, does that mean a British company is going to make fewer smartphones? No, because there isn't a British smartphone manufacturer. Do we want the Korean smartphone designer to be educated in Cambridge or Seoul? It's certainly better for the UK if she's got a Cambridge degree. And Samsung buys (some of) its chip designs from ARM in Cambridge, so every extra smartphone brings money into the UK.

2) Balotelli keeps getting the excuse of ""*He needs to play in a front two to work*"" but no-one aside from a GK should be so one-dimensional. Coutinho (CM, AM, #10, RM, F9) and Sterling (LW, RW, #10, ST, RWB) played a number of positions that weren't preferred and either played well or at least put the effort in, they're 22 and 20, plus one of them supposedly doesn't even want to be at the club anymore.

3) Mario also gets the excuse of *""Balotelli needs to play with Sturridge to play well""*. He partnered Sturridge for 60mins vs Tottenham and 45mins vs Palace where it worked well.

Most migrants on average are unaware of any benefits they can claim when they come to the UK.  Vast majority within the migrant community have just come here for **work**.  If you talk to migrants most want to work over claim any benefits 99% are unaware that the UK has a benefit system. UK is a successful economy which has a rich history along with a massive amount of soft power and reach.  Fairy tale that most are coming here to take advantage is far better compared to reality UK is one of the most successful rich nations on the earth.  Also plays into the Us and Them narrative that is common within this debate. 

What is missing from this debate is **reality vs perception** 

For the longest period of time my perception was incorrect against the reality.  Polish workers which are semi skilled are common for my area I end up seeing them every day does that make my town Polish.  No the number of Polish within my area is something like 2% but just happen to see this group so my perception is distorted.  

**Another conclusion**

On average migrants are semi skilled/skilled/highly skilled workers coming in to fill gaps in the labour force.  Migrants seeking work are on average younger more fit less likely to be a drain.  You should went down the route that in work training in the UK has declined and employers are seeking out people already trained instead of investment into training.  Education for life has disappeared now it education only until a certain point. 
Should be looking to blame the current short term culture which has meant lower investment into your labour force high staff turn over. Something most companies right now are not doing investing.....
UK does have a flexible labour force but behind that is a worrying trend.  
Massive decline in in-work training programs within the UK over the past 30 years. Also a major decline in overall investment within the UK over the past 30 years.  

Time we rethink how education is done and invest. 

**Short term over long term**

Another point is should we look at kicking out jobless Brits who can't find work like migrants.  Instead of asking the question is the current system efficient.  Germans have taken the view that jobless migrants would move to find work.  However again reality jobless people at the bottom can't move and only skilled migrants do. 
I don't know about you but I rather we look into why the labour market is working like it and what we could do to improve it.  Demonizing won't fix the problems only going to cause damage at a social level and to the economy blocking migrants coming here.

If you say to a landlord ir agency, I'm not happy...but here have ¬£1000 anyway.
They will do fuck all.
Because next month...you will just pay then again.

So the most profitable thing for the agency or landlord to do is to just keep taking your money, until you get fed up and leave, then they rent it to the next victim.

If you hold back the rent, and they cant just re-rent the flat...you are causing them issues.
At which point your issues become their issues.

Best thing to do...write them a letter or email stating you will be witholding the rent until certain issues are sorted.

Remember the only person who can evict you is a Judge. 
You have so many rights.
If agency or landlord try anything...just dial 999 and tell the police you are being illegally evicted or harassed etc. They know that only a tiny amount of illegal evictions get reported, and the law is totally on your side...

It seems to me that people are more averse to the left than the right, we can argue about that all day but it's quite plain from the history of elections over the past 40 years.  This is despite left-leaning agendas being dominant in online forums and popular culture (e.g. every comedian being left-wing).

So people would rather have the tories more than Labour, even though the Milliband manifesto was actually quite sensible in a number of ways.  Arguably he could have presented it better: ""mansion tax"" sounds envious and vindictive, but I think land-value taxes have merit, it just needed presenting better.

The trouble is, the tories are actually more evil than people give them credit for.  It's not simple ""lack of compassion"" that's driving this, it is purely ideological; they want the long-term employed and/or non-self-sufficient disabled people out of society entirely, or adopted by charities.  Either way, they want them out of prime Central London where they're currently getting in the way and not spending enough money.

What would be more popular than the tories?  An actual liberal (in the classic ""individual liberty"" sense), wealth-generating (which the tories claim to be, but aren't) agenda.  You could argue that's what Tony Blair presented in 1997, and what Cameron offered in 2010 (and was only held to a fraction of it by the LibDems); but now in 2015, it's classic ""protect old wealth, fuck everyone else"" Conservative thinking.",null,1,null,1436006342,null,0,false,0,csruswx,null,t3_3c2zmq,null,t1_csruswx,null,t1_csrt0x1,null,null,null,1437575697,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

It's one thing to take a quote out of context, but to not include the quote at all, or barely include it in favour of  paraphrasing... to me that's very poor reporting that has no regard for objectivity.

As for Tim Hunt's comments over the problems of male/female collaboration in science. This is where even wider context is missing.

Something I was not aware of when this story broke is that Tim was referring to his own personal experience. He personally has had issues working with women in a lab. He has said that this is a not a reflection on women in general but on his own failings to be disciplined in the workplace. This is why he said he was being honest.

His comments were intended as self-deprecating, honest remarks relating to his own conduct. I do not believe this constitutes sexism. The use of those comments as the basis for an ironic joke can be seen to frame the issue of how sexism in science is viewed. You can read it as saying: ""these events can happen in the lab and we can end up believing that it's a general reflection of women in science, but it's not"". The ""but it's not"" is implied from when he continues by saying ""Now, seriously"" and praises the role of women scientists in Korea's development.

Consider the comparison with racism. It's the difference between saying you were robbed by a black person and saying that black people are robbers. One is a personal experience, the other is a racist statement.

In the wider context it makes no sense to me that ""Perhaps we should make separate labs for boys and girls?"" could be a serious statement. Surely it's highlighting the absurdity of the logic which says that women are a problem for science and preparing the actual serious statement that women scientists have made a huge impact in Korea.

However if we now go back to the articles you linked, how do they report on this?

In most cases its fine.
If you think your landlord is going to break your legs...probably a good idea to pay the rent.

You are holding all of the cards.
You have the property.
You have control of the revenue stream that property has.
You are protected by the law, and unless you cause criminal damage, are pretty much untouchable.
Meanwhile your landlord is walking through a legal minefield.
Chances are, not getting the rent, or interruption in rent is gonna have a big impact on them.

You will also have...in your account...the full rent anyway, so that means you can close liabilities if you want / need in seconds.

Eviction wont stop you renting elsewhere...thats just complete rubbish.
And if you get a reference hurdle its VERY simple to overcome and you would have to actually be simple for that to ever cause you any issues.

You are not using the judicial system to fix problems...
You are forcing the shyster agency that conned you and exists only to leach hard earned cash from you and the owner of the flat...to provide you with what they led you to believe you were getting.
If they want to take it to court instead of fixing the issue, that is their prerogative, but the law is on your side anyway.

They have been dishonest, that gos far in court, if it ever gets that far, judge will probably order a lower rent be liable, or rent not payable.
They won't take it to court tho, because they will be fucked if they do and will know that.

If you want to hold back rent but don't want to be too confrontational, then hold back half or a portion, explain you appreciate they have costs etc...but this really wont do

Pro tip for the future...

Yes. 

Give it some years and through experience and learned cynicism you'll find out why. An organisation's culture is seeded from the top down; jumping on your employees and firing them for them for mistakes or controversy drives away talent and stifles creativity and morale. It shows an exceptionally lazy and counter-productive way of problem solving which talented people abhor.

In a business selling pies or coffee to the masses that's not really a problem. For something dynamic and innovative like a university, advertising or technology organisation it leads to a toxic culture which harms the organisation.

Brand is trying to inspire people who are (at least) a generation younger than mine. Clarity and education is fine for my generation, but not for the majority of twenty-somethings.

I left because I was fed up with London, and it's just not worth commuting in. Other regions in the UK still can't compete with London (imho), which is a shame. 

It was pretty easy, though some things are more difficult than they ought to be (e.g. getting a bank account, getting a flat, getting goddamn ""VDSL"" like some caveman instead of fibre). 

Berlin is a fantastic city. I'm based in Mitte (central) and I could never afford a place like this, in this sort of location, in London. The transport is better, the cycling seems much safer, and the neighbourhood is very nice. 

In terms of the negatives, obviously there's the German language, though English is widely spoken. The bureaucracy is real, though I guess we're all just used to the way the UK works; it's probably still annoying for outsiders trying to get things done there.

‚Ä¢ Friday Night Dinner - a comedy that depicts Shabbat dinner in the secular Jewish family.

‚Ä¢ Psychoville - a dark comedy/mystery/ psychological thriller written by and starring The League of Gentlemen members.

‚Ä¢ Misfits - a science fiction comedy-drama about a group of young offenders sentenced to work in a community service program, where they obtain supernatural powers after a strange electrical storm. The first two seasons are definitely worth watching. Season three is still enjoyable but missing ""Nathan"" who is a character that brought a lot of comedic energy to the show. I have not seen seasons 4 and 5 yet.

‚Ä¢ Absolutely Fabulous - I snuck this here even though it was mainstream at the time. :)

I have to echo some of the  recommendations listed by others:

‚Ä¢ Black Mirror - a must for any fan of The Twilight Zone.
‚Ä¢ The Thick of It - the HBO show Veep is an American ""remake"" of this. 
‚Ä¢ Inside No. 9 - I guess I have a thing for anthologies.
‚Ä¢ Father Ted - soooo funny!
‚Ä¢ Red Dwarf - a bit uneven in the later series but the first four are definitely worth checking out.
‚Ä¢ Black Adder - an oldie but goody.

These positions are probably out of the reach of young men and women due to experience. Elderly men and woman are probably out of the picture too because of retirement ill health etc. So that skews selection in favour of the middle aged.

Its far more likely that middle aged men have an uninterupted carreer and years of service due to women taking career breaks to raise a family. You can argue whether that should be the case and whether that burden/joy should be shared more equally between the sexes, but you can't argue that at the moment this favours males.

If you are in the running for a very powerful job its likely that you are already in a fairly high powered job, which will make you one of the wealthier demographic already. 

So we are pretty much left with relatively wealthy, middle aged men in the running the vast majority of the times. 

What exactly the white to non-white middle aged men demographics are in the UK, and by how much are these trends bucked on appointments to well paid jobs I don't know.

My point was that Brand's message is by far the most effective way of getting younger people interested (as well as inflamed). And given that said generation has a pisspoor attention span, coupled with the problems that our modern education brings (i.e. nothing outside the curriculum gets a mention) then unfortunately education will not work for the majority no matter how effective you or I would like (to think) it to be.

Anger is bad when it's unfocussed. The strikes in the 80s didn't work because Scargill was a little ginger pot of unfocussed rage. But the anger that (and I regret using this term) potential jihadists feel is anything but unfocussed. I think Brand is doing what he can to bring a focal point for the 20-somethings. Older people will disagree with it for various reasons but until such time as a more *effective* means of communicating with folks comes along then that'll have to do.

Don't forget that some of the greatest political leaders and icons started out as angry young tykes in a big mob. Without someone like Brand kicking the beehive there will be no change at all. Which for a lawyer is probably not such a bad thing :) but for many it will only make matters (crumbling infrastructure, pisspoor wages, fuck all pension) worse.

[Here](http://www.expressandstar.com/election/2015/05/06/tom-watson-hits-back-over-muslim-rally-accusation/) is his response. Again, **I am not praising him as a hero, or saying he is a perfect bastion of virtue**.

Now, I think the actuality of the event was that the crowd *was* split, but whether that was done by the community itself, or by organisation is unclear. What probably *is* a safe assumption is that it wasn't a suggestion by either of the MPs present; as that would be political *suicide*. What is the most likely scenario is that any split in the crowd was done entirely out of their control, and they were left with two choices: Engage the community as they intended to, without mentioning it, or simply *not engage the community at all*. Political discourse does not happen when you refuse to talk to the people; it's about compromise. It's a less than ideal scenario, sure, but there were likely no right answers.

I also think that the newspaper has a motivation to sensationalise the story to an extent; this behaviour is basically universal at this point. Naturally, the MP himself as a motivation to completely dismiss the claims, hence his response. His claim is backed up by numerous other candidates that were present. So take both sides with a grain of salt. My conclusion is that this isn't a situation worth needlessly condemning an MP for.",null,0,null,1436010025,null,0,1436010577,0,csrvljz,null,t3_3c03bn,null,t1_csrvljz,null,t1_csrv9um,null,null,null,1437576360,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

What about effecting arrest? Or if the person being arrested is a threat to themselves? I ask that only because in this particular situation it was quoted earlier that the chap was trying to swallow drugs; would the application of an amount of force be reasonable to stop him potentially killing himself (in all fairness I doubt the officer would know what they are trying to swallow)?

Cameras are becoming more prevalent within policing, but I do disagree that they should be 'always on' if for no other reason than cameras can be a barrier to communication - for example if an officer was trying to talk someone off a bridge do you think they would appreciate being filmed? I am 100% behind police having body-worn video btw, it's a fantastic tool.

No officer has ever been convicted, but plenty have been tried. Perhaps that is more an indication that our use of force laws (which generally apply to the public as much as the police) are fit for purpose and officers are trained appropriately? The 'licence to kill' that you mention is more than likely covered by legislation in which 'any person' is covered, for example common law power of self defence, so by that definition ANYONE has a 'licence to kill'. Given that the number of interactions in which police are likely to employ force are likely higher than a regular person on the street, I'd say that is a pretty positive statistic, particularly as the courts (and CPS and IPCC) are wholly independent of the police.

I'm assuming you're not a police officer from your response (correct me if I'm wrong!). I think it would be immensely valuable for the public to take up the opportunity of 'ride-alongs' to see first-hand the difficult circumstances in which a split-second decision sometimes has to be made. Perhaps then there would be less rioting as a result of the application of (fully-justified) force. I saw a great video a while back [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfi3Ndh3n-g) which I think does do a good job of putting things in to perspective - worth a watch if you have a moment (it's only five minutes long).

I think you're right about the education system, and maybe this is where we can find some common ground. If we can adjust that then we don't need children taking their political advice from an inflammatory source. It's effectively like swapping out quality for tabloid reasoning. Though I accept finding good teachers is difficult and often people just switch off for the more entertaining. Brand is an entertainer first, and a quality political philosopher last. 

&gt; Anger is bad when it's unfocussed.

Here is where it gets difficult, I suppose, since it ultimately depends on how or what the anger is directed at. And crucially for me, on what grounds that anger is coming from. If it's coming from tabloid-types then it's not as 'good' as if it came from a better, more balanced and pragmatic understanding. That's not to say blind but focused anger can never achieve positive results, I'd just be more comfortable with 20/20 focused anger. But even there I'd rather remove the anger as well. 

You're right that some may have started out as angry tykes in a mob. But I'd also ask how many of the greatest still are? I accept the exposure is better than nothing, but I also recognise that that's an extreme comparison. I think there are better ways it can be done. 

Lawyers aren't inherently against change. Change if anything is actually good for business because otherwise everyone would wind up knowing and understanding how all the rules fit together. They wouldn't need experts to keep up with the 1000s of laws that Parliament passes every single year. 

But it's also something many lawyers themselves fight for, either when they become politicians, or day in and day out when they're representing their client. Decisions influenced by courtroom advocacy can, and do change the law.

So women with vital if massively undervalued experience outside of the business/political treadmill, if only for a few years, must be dismissed from consideration?

So: a Tory scheme from the outset, abolished by a left-wing government then reinstalled in a fiscal emergency and made permanent thereafter. But they were **not** an original part of the plan for the NHS, nor are they inevitable.

Secondly, ""ts not some Tory plan ""soften the public up for the idea of private prescriptions"""" -- you're deliberately missing the context that *printing prices on high-cost items* is clearly going to stick in the minds of those people who get them.

null,false,B1ack0mega,null,null,null,"January exams were shit because you are just cramming one module into the first few months and especially shit for colleges as you had to initially assess the people coming in, leaving even less time. It did get one out of the way, but long term it is bad for learning as it's just forgotten very quickly after the exam. However, having so many exams in one go is also shit, which is why linear should also be less stressful as there will be less exams.

Speaking now as a teacher, I'm just fucking sick of A-level maths being modular; it doesn't go linear until September 2017 to (rightfully) match the GCSE version the new students took. In a modular system, are just pandering to the exams rather than actually providing a good education because the pure maths is just arbitrarily split into a variety of modules, which any good mathematician knows is absurd. ""Oh I learnt this in Core 3, I can't possible need that knowledge or technique in Core 4."" and students are are very consciously dividing the modules up so that they know what to revise for each exam. It sucks but obviously I can't blame them, as that is the system they (and I) face(d).

At A-level level, you basically only have pure maths, stats, mechanics, and decision/operational research. The various applied strains should obviously be distinct from the pure, but splitting the pure up into four modules arbitrarily is just dumb. At such a low level, the topics are not in-depth enough to warrant any splitting whatsoever, contrasted to a maths degree where everything NEEDS splitting and modularising in order to provide the required depth/specialisation. Even then, the higher you go (Masters/PhD+), the more related it all becomes. When I write homework, I try to provide a lot of crossover between pure modules so that students have to think about how to approach the problems; many react positively to this, but some just refuse to accept the premise as they just want it all nice and separate ready for the exams. Rubbish.

Under a linear system, I am free to actually just teach them maths and provide them with a good mathematical education (which is in my view the entire point of education), with the reminder that there's two exams towards the end that they need to start preparing for at an appropriate point. Having carefully read multiple times through the currently proposed version of the linear maths/further maths A-level curriculum, I can safely say they have done a good job.

Arguably he could have presented it better: ""mansion tax"" sounds envious and vindictive, but I think land-value taxes have merit, it just needed presenting better.

Tax has always had the potential to move society in a particular direction.  But with so much power in the hands of government (both left and right) I wonder if that is possible any more.  

The state simply has too much momentum in protecting certain interests and suppressing others.  The UK is pathologically opposed to change of any kind and you cannot do anything without support from the government. We suppress the individual dynamism in case it offends someone's house price.

Most migrants on average are unaware of any benefits they can claim when they come to the UK.  Vast majority within the migrant community have just come here for **work**.  If you talk to migrants most want to work over claim any benefits 99% are unaware that the UK has a benefit system. UK is a successful economy which has a rich history along with a massive amount of soft power and reach.  Fairy tale that most are coming here to take advantage is far better compared to reality UK is one of the most successful rich nations on the earth.  Also plays into the Us and Them narrative that is common within this debate. 

What is missing from this debate is **reality vs perception** 

For the longest period of time my perception was incorrect against the reality.  Polish workers which are semi skilled are common for my area I end up seeing them every day does that make my town Polish.  No the number of Polish within my area is something like 2% but just happen to see this group so my perception is distorted.  

**Another conclusion**

On average migrants are semi skilled/skilled/highly skilled workers coming in to fill gaps in the labour force.  Migrants seeking work are on average younger more fit less likely to be a drain.  You should went down the route that in work training in the UK has declined and employers are seeking out people already trained instead of investment into training.  Education for life has disappeared now it education only until a certain point. 
Should be looking to blame the current short term culture which has meant lower investment into your labour force high staff turn over. Something most companies right now are not doing investing.....
UK does have a flexible labour force but behind that is a worrying trend.  
Massive decline in in-work training programs within the UK over the past 30 years. Also a major decline in overall investment within the UK over the past 30 years.  

Time we rethink how education is done and invest. 

**Short term over long term**

Another point is should we look at kicking out jobless Brits who can't find work like migrants.  Instead of asking the question is the current system efficient.  Germans have taken the view that jobless migrants would move to find work.  However again reality jobless people at the bottom can't move and only skilled migrants do. 
I don't know about you but I rather we look into why the labour market is working like it and what we could do to improve it.  Demonizing won't fix the problems only going to cause damage at a social level and to the economy blocking migrants coming here.

Although the loss of the Thirteen Colonies marked the end of the ""First British Empire"", it certainly didn't mark the start of colonial decline. Lands in Australia and Canada were gained (and retained, *coughcough1812*) in the years following 1783.  
Although the loss of the American colonies were a bit of a hit, it wasn't a crippling blow to Britain or her Empire, and it also encouraged eastwards expansion to Asia and India, establishing what would be come far more prosperous colonies throughout India and gaining more control through conflicts such as Anglo-Mysore wars and Anglo-Maratha wars which would push Britain's, more so the East India Company's economic and military power at the beginning of the 19th century.  
Also, with Napoleons defeat at Waterloo in 1815 ending the 23 year long state of conflict on the European continent after the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, Britain emerged as the foremost world power. This would be the start of *Pax Britannica*  that would last until 1914 where Britain was the foremost world power, and the empire expanded, going from strength to strength. The British Empire, as well as European power peaked in about 1922. At this point, a *huge* majority of the world was under the control of a European nation. It was around this time that the decline of colonisation and Empires began, with India finally being granted independence in 1947. The last country to gain independence was Hong Kong, quite unfairly in 1997.

The end of the First British Empire was brought about by the American Independence, but it certainly didn't hamper Britains expansion, if anything it marked the start of Britain as a world power.

If you paid more than one months rent as deposit you are a mug...and are getting mugged off...there is no reason to charge more.

Work isn't inherently stressful, but juggling multiple demands are. 

In the past, people did a lot of work, but not in a lot of areas. 

Now, what with the gender division of labour shrinking (a good thing in my eyes) and increasing participation in public life on the internet, as well as work becoming increasingly diverse and intrusive for most people, things are more stressful than they were before. Also media pressure simultaneously tell us to work harder and to cry about hardships (in order to make us go and buy stuff normally), which normalises stress as a constant condition.

Fair point.

So what? If anything this could be a point against as it narrows experience.  

&gt;Wealthy - probably an indicator of already being in a high powered job, so experience again.  

So the only experience of value is that of making money? Isn't that attitude a significant part of the problems we currently face?

It is a disadvantage to be non-white and in politics in this country. The figures for representation of ethnic minorities are in a pdf I posted a link to earlier.

Before CBT, I'd never ridden a bike with gears. Just wee 50cc things offroad and the like.

Turned up, ran through the theory in like 20 minutes, it was basic stuff that both myself and the other guy I was doing it with already knew. Got some gear on and went out to the bikes. 

The bikes were about ~1000m from the training ground and usually there is a van to transport them round, but on that day, the van was doing something else. It was also hot as fuck, as I'm sure you're all aware.

The instructor didn't want us walking the bikes around (through a busy enough industrial estate) in the sweltering heat, so he was going to ride the bikes around with us on the back, walk back, get the next bike, etc.

The other guy I was with seemed to know his way around a bike and he offered just to ride around himself. The instructor then turned to me as said something like, ""what about you? You've ridden a bike before right?""

To which I replied something like, ""ehhh... yeah, nothing with gears, but sure.""

Swung my leg over the bike, stuck it into first and doodled over to the training area. Was totally fine. Just a little roundabout to navigate and watch out for a few cars. Nothing serious.

In the training area for about 15 minutes. Did a few basic things like the whole observation, signal, blah blah blah and then some cone drills. 

We then headed straight out onto the road.

I was flying up and down dual carriageways, through side streets, bombing round corners. All with like 15 minutes bike training. 

I thought it was ridiculous that I could just pitch up, some kiddo eager to learn, get thrown on a bike, do a few drills and then be sent out on the road!

Loved it though and it was totally fine. Just struck me as something that could have went horribly wrong if I wasn't competent enough. It was actually the best thing I've ever done though.

Do you know how difficult it is to safely get someone in to handcuffs that is putting up ANY kind of a struggle? It's going to look messy, particularly to anyone that hasn't had direct experience of that type of situation. Someone choking in a restaurant is completely incomparable - but yes I would strike a choking person on the back with an open palm, that's how you're supposed to deal with a choking person in the first instance(!)

Odds are a camera that is not directly in the poor person's face, so again there's a slight difference between city CCTV (which is designed to be non-obtrusive, generally) and an overtly-worn body-worn camera. Two separate things, with two separate levels of reaction.

It's hard enough to get ANYONE in to court. We rely on a burden of proof that has to be addressed by evidence (as we absolutely should). That is not a police-specific issue, I'm afraid. Your statement that firearms 'collude' when writing statements is a bit disingenuous at best.

It's all very well saying what 'should' have happened, having had no experience of actually being involved in a given situation. If police couldn't use force to detain a suspect then they would literally just walk off - if they had committed a non-violent crime then within your definition of appropriate use of force the police would have to let them go. I do hope you've never been a victim of a non-violent crime, as I suspect you'd have a very different opinion if that was the case.

EDIT: 
&gt; Punching someone repeatedly who swallowed a bag of weed while he is on the floor isn't something I would do.

How would the cop know that it's weed anyway. And what if they had an allergic reaction to it. And what if the bag it was in stopped them from breathing...

London was too expensive, the housing was horrendous value for money and the people openly hostile.  That wanky superiority attitude people have because they think they're living an aspirational lifestyle they saw on Sex and the City.   Lived there for ten years, chose to explore the world before I got to old to do it.

Melbourne has been such a great place to **just live** in.  The jobs are well remunerated and the accommodation is better value for money.  You get a big city in Melbourne for a fraction of the travel time as opposed to spending an hour getting to work in The Big Smoke.

The nightlife is near perfect out here because people are friendly. The clubs are cool and the weather is, even in winter, reasonable enough to sit outside in with mates and beers.  London you take your life in your hands catching the tube anywhere on the weekend and all clubs are inside dingy sweatboxes.  Here it's beer-gardens or open air bars.

Having said that, the gigs out here are not the best quality.  The acts just cannot compete with those in London.  Your average band in London will be staffed with good players from all over the world who are up against graduates from the several music schools.  Here it's just the born and bred Melbourne folk doing their best in a small market.

The weather.  You're never more than a couple of days without sunshine, even in ""winter"".  Back in London before I left, it was snowing during one of the coldest years in living memory.  

The beaches.  'Nuff said.  

The political attitudes out here are less inclined to multiculturalism than to an Australian identity.  It works well for them and the immigrants like it too.  There is a general sense of ""when you get here, fit in and have a laugh"" as opposed to London where everyone tries to outdo one another in being a unique snowflake who is making cash.

Thanks to the strong catholic influence out here (I've never been religious by affiliation or otherwise), there is less drugs and less crime.  I get the sense that if I was to settle here (which I'm not, I'm going back to London for work) then I may very well turn up now and again to a church with friends and colleagues because it's the done thing.  There is an easy marriage of parochialism and big city life.  You can have both worlds.

Alas, it's not big enough just yet for this stage in my life and so I'm going to head back to London to build a career and business and make the money I should have made in my twenties.

The process is a CBT, a Theory Test, a Mod 1 and a Mod 2.

* The CBT is 'compulsory basic training' and isn't a test as such. It's what allows you to ride a 125cc bike with L-plates. The format is that you turn up somewhere, they teach you how to ride a bike in a car-park and when you can do that safely they teach you how to do it on the road safely. When they're happy that you'll not kill yourself, you get a CBT certificate.

* The theory test is basically the same as the car one. You cannot use the fact you have a car license to demonstrate that you probably know what the signs mean, unfortunately. There's also a hazard-perception bit, as with the car test.

* A Mod1 is the off-the-road component to the bike test. A few years ago they took all the specific manoevres you used to have to do in the practical test and made this separate test for them. There's a prescribed course you have to follow and it's largely low-speed manoevers, with the exception of a swerve which must be done at more than 30mph.

* The mod2 is the traditional practical test. 45 mins of riding around under instruction, not fucking up. 

It is normal to do a ""DAS"" (Direct Access Scheme) which is a term heldover from when there were more indirect ways to get your license. Generally you'll spend a few full days training, culminating in a mod1, then a few more full days training culminating in the mod2. It's not normal to learn to ride a motorbike by doing odd hour-long tests in the evenings as it is with a car, but I've seen places offer it. Many DAS places will also do your CBT for you, but lots of people like to get their CBT and then spend a few months on L-plates getting more comfortable on the bike before doing their test.

Every 125cc bike for sale in the UK is suitable for riding on a CBT, since there's not really any other reason to buy one.

But it narrows it into a career field. Everyone at the age of 50 has 50 years experience of something!

You don't necessarily have to be making money as a profession to be wealthy. The head of a large council will be on a wage that would put him in the relatively wealthy bracket, and his only experience may be providing local services.

One problem with the propaganda war is that British have been so self-suppressed, there is so much censorship, that we cannot produce anything half-serious that isn't based entirely on buffoonery. So our movies are regarded, quite rightly, as lightweight around the world.

null,false,Haurian,eng-kent,Kent,null,"Sure. You hold a full car licence, and are over 25.

The first job is to take a CBT course, the one day course you mentioned. This will allow you to ride a 50cc moped limited to 30 mph without L plates, validating the P class on your licence. It will also allow you to ride a 125cc bike meeting the A1 category on L plates for two years, but you won't be able to carry a pillion or use motorways. A 125 is perfect for city commuting, with excellent fuel consumption and capable of around 70 mph. Most four-stroke 125s on the market meet the restrictions, modern examples including the Yamaha YBR-125 and YZF-R125 and the Honda CBF-125 and CBR-125. Two-strokes generally exceed the restrictions, and are often sport focused.

Once you hold a CBT and have passed the motorcycle theory test, you have some more options. Given your age, I would suggest you go for the full A class via Direct Access, allowing you to ride any bike. This involves passing the two motorcycle practical test modules on a motorcycle above 40kW. In order to practice for this, you'll need to use a training school as you can only ride bikes that size under instruction. Most schools will offer a package deal for you to get your licence, usually including the CBT course, theory test, bike hire and test fees. This is often done as a week course, but you may be able to spread it out depending on school. Prices would be in the region of ¬£750.

As such, unlike with an Assured Shorthold Tenancy which makes up the majority of the private rented sector agreements, he can infact be evicted without a Court Order. Although this all hinges on him being given reasonable notice.

What is reasonable notice will depend on;

* What's been previously agreed (This can be verbal but is obviously hard to argue/evidence)

Once reasonable notice has been given and has expired, the owner of the property can change the locks whilst the occupier is out, but cannot interfere with the occupiers possessions and cannot use physical force to eject the occupier. So if your friend were to remain in the property during this process, the landlord would be left with no option but to apply to court for a possession order as this is the only way to forcibly evict an occupier.

So really your friends only defence would hinge on arguing the 'reasonable notice' However as mentioned above he CANNOT be forcibly evicted at this stage, so even if he overstays the 48hours the landlord cannot get him out the property, but he will have to remain in the property so the landlord has no chance to change the locks whilst he is not present at the address.

null,false,toomanyairmiles,,Labour Member,null,"When you look at enacted policy across the political spectrum in this country you realise that all governments are centre right, and there is an obvious decadal rightward drift - inertia meaning that the further right UKIP drift, the further right *all* parties drift. There isn't a credible centrist party in the UK, nor is there a credible left wing party, although there are parties that have left wing members and some elements of traditional left wing ideas. How individuals view their party alignments appears to me to be a function of where they think the centre is more than any other factor.

That drift is most obvious in the US right now. Obama is basically a Reagan era moderate Republican with more liberal personal social values, and the Republicans have gone so far to the right that they sound like a fringe party on almost any subject. Trump's candidacy being the zenith of that drift.

Churchill for example had this to say on the NHS:-

&gt;‚ÄúThe dis¬≠cov¬≠er¬≠ies of heal¬≠ing sci¬≠ence must be the inher¬≠i¬≠tance of all. That is clear: Dis¬≠ease must be attacked,  whether it occurs in the poor¬≠est or the rich¬≠est man or woman sim¬≠ply on the ground that it is the enemy; and it must be attacked just in the sane way as the fire brigade will give its  full assis¬≠tance to the hum¬≠blest cot¬≠tage as read¬≠ily as to the  most impor¬≠tant mansion‚Ä¶.Our pol¬≠icy is to cre¬≠ate a national health ser¬≠vice in order to ensure that every¬≠body in the coun¬≠try, irre¬≠spec¬≠tive of means, age, sex, or occu¬≠pa¬≠tion, shall have equal oppor¬≠tu¬≠ni¬≠ties to ben¬≠e¬≠fit from the best and most up-to-date med¬≠ical and allied ser¬≠vices available.‚Äù

No modern Conservative would recognise the post war Conservative party's policy positions as being truly Conservative outside of their views on personal social policy.

So is this era about personal values or the ability of a given set of people to communicate policy ideas and values and is left/right even useful anymore?

On arrival at the police station Alder was ""partially dragged and partially carried,"" handcuffed and unconscious, from a police van and placed on the floor of the custody suite. Officers chatted between themselves and speculated that he was faking illness.[6][8] Twelve minutes later one of the officers present noticed that Alder was not making any breathing noises and although resuscitation was attempted, he was pronounced dead at the scene.[9] A post mortem indicated that the head injury alone would not have killed him.[6][10] The incident was captured on the police station's closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras.

null,false,rjolly,lfc68,,null,"What has Carra got to do with Wisdom. Yes players change positions. But Carra was always a versatile player. Played CB plenty of times just not regularly because Hyypia and Henchoz formed a good partnership. Carra played everywhere in defence and even in midfield. But that has nothing to do with Wisdom. 

Wisdom is primarily a RB. Drogba played fullback at academy level and even when he started getting senior games in the French league. But he was better suited up front. Wisdom played CB at academy level but has primarily been a RB. Why do you see Wisdom as more suited to a CB role? No managers seem to think that and either way he wouldn't get a game there for Liverpool.

Regarding Flanagan. I think he is a decent player. All I said is that he has shown himself to be better than Manquillo has. Although Manquillo has has limited game time. Flanagan was solid for Liverpool in Rodgers second season. He was versatile enough to play LB was effective in terms of attack which suits Rodgers style. Hence why he was able to get forward in games such as West Ham where he won a penalty and Spurs where he scored a goal. He also put tackles in. Hard tackles if they needed to be. Why do you think Flanno is average? And are there many examples when he was beaten often and his positioning was poor.
I'm not neccesairly saying that this isn't true, you may be correct I just can't think of many examples backing up what you're saying.

And as you are saying that I think that it is worth noting than Manquillo suffered from exactly what you criticise Flanagan for. When we played West Ham and lost 3-1, most players were poor but Manquillo's positioning was some of the worst I have ever seen from a professional footballer. When Sakho scored he sort of half crossed/half shot to goal. Valencia was running to the far post and Manquillo was supposed to be marking him but got bored chasing Valencia and focused on the ball which was with Sakho on the other side of the pitch. Despite the fact that all the other defenders were focusing on him. That meant Valencia was free to run unmarked to the far post meaning Mignolet had to come off his line and the ball went in. Even if Mignolet didn't come off his line Valencia would have a free chance at a header on goal. 

It wasn't just the fact he had made an error but such a ridiculous error that footballers learn not to do when they're kids. I'm not saying Manquillo is a terrible player. But he suffered from the exact thing Flanno suffered from and to such a poor extent.

&gt;Civilians should not be repatriated as if they were fallen 'soldiers'. They aren't. They died on holiday not in service. Sad as it is, all this militarization makes it look as if the country is at war. It will legitimise a response (like bombing Syria). They will be used to justify an imperialist response.

In response to the Daily Mail:

&gt;My response (which they most likely will not publish): The return of the innocent victims of the Tunisian atrocity to the UK had perhaps by logistic necessity to be undertaken by the RAF. My comments were intended to highlight how this appears to militarize, perhaps unintentionally, what was otherwise a tragic civilian event.

&gt;My core argument, made in private, is that there is a real danger that those with their own agenda might seek to use our natural revulsion at the slaughter to further their aims of getting support for increased military intervention in Syria. Syria is 1, 500 miles from Tunisia and with 8 suspects already detained by Tunisian authorities, any response in Syria can hardly be targeted at those that perpetrated the outrage.

Let's do a quick run on Melbourne first. Moved out there with my family when I was 16. I lived there during the equivalents of A-Levels and for university. The city itself was pretty nice, but that's all it is. Whilst it's pretty nice, it's not terribly exciting either. I found it pretty hard to bond with Australians, as they tend to make acquaintances and superficial friendships through small talk (usually AFL, football/cricket or getting wasted) Although they were pretty fun to hang around and party with they were the most dreadfully boring people. The city itself is nice - all the shops you need, good layout, great public transport, nice houses, green spaces, pay there is decently high (far more than the UK) but the people are rather provincial with a small town mentality which spoils it. Nothing wrong with that in itself, but you have to be born there to truly fit in. Think the etonian/oxbridge elite are annoying? Melbourne's elite are the old boy private school network (I went to one of them, but thats besides the point) who all grew up together on the same street. People there are obsessed with what high school you went to. However, luckily enough, during my time in Melbourne, I was exposed to the international community (US, China, Singapore, UK, Saffa etc) which gave me new perspectives and opportunities that I would've never had in the UK - which resulted me in moving to Singapore. I would've gone stir crazy if it wasn't for my expat freinds in Melbourne (those overseas in Melb or Melbournians who lived overseas)

Live in Singapore now, and it's perfect in almost every way. I love my life here, *so much*. It's quite literally paradise - I'm living in the lap of luxury and there are endless amount of things to do despite the island being half the size of London (and only half of the island being populated) For $950,000 (¬£450,000) I have a 2 bedroom freehold condo with a tennis court, concierge, gym, swimming pool and views of the city (my apt doesn't though) with very low strata fees. In London it would probably get me a zone 2 studio. [Most condos in SG](http://www.newlaunch-condo.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/new-launch-condo-the-lush-002.jpg) are gleaming, visually stunning glass towers with hanging gardens, rooftop pools, high end shops at the bottom. [On the other end of the scale there are HDB](http://hdbflatforsale.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/PMO-day-9-292.jpg) apartments which are a little shabby looking but they are extremely nice places to live in actually - they are usually reserved as affordable housing for citizens only.

It's truly a microcosm of the world. There are european, north american, african, australian people all happily living together. The local singaporeans are incredibly friendly and outgoing - it just rubs off on you and you just can't help but be the same way - despite usually being introverted. I go out partying almost every weekend - [most bars are like this](http://www.thebestsingapore.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ku-de-ta.jpg) Shopping is pretty cheap here and the food is incredible, at far lower prices again (like $3 for healthy chinese fast food)

Pay is really high - $80k minimum for expats, usually around $150k (¬£75k), often $200k+ easy if you have a couple years experience in almost any field. Income taxes are just 15 to 20% depending on your income and just 7% GST meaning you can live it up, save more and accumulate wealth faster all at the same time! It's easier to get promoted faster, and there is less competition here so you tend to climb up the ladder faster regardless of your skill (although you do have to work hard, long hours) 

Everything in Singapore is just, nice. They really put a lot of thought into having nice buildings and surroundings. Even the roads are [meticulously planned and maintained](http://www.localecology.org/images/seasia09_singapore_41.JPG) Every [building looks ultra modern like this mall](http://i.cdn.travel.cnn.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_large/public/article-images/large/Ion_Orchard_MAIN.jpg?itok=mqzqAcYZ) It certainly makes a change from the drab 60s buildings in the UK and Australia.

My living standard here is ridiculously high. I earn more than I would anywhere else, very low taxes, low cost of living (except for property, but still cheaper) Because I already have my mortgage (I pay ahead of schedule), savings (save more than I need) and investments covered by a small percentage of my salary, I have a ton of cash to blow whereas before I was scraping together every penny and living paycheck to paycheck for a medicore existence. I can afford to take 3 holidays a year, buy clothes at the likes of Prada and Moncler, have a personal trainer etc etc. Almost every other expat and Singaporean here that I know also have the same standard of living. One of them even has a maid which only costs them $600 a month. Only thing I go without here is a car which is prohibitively expensive, but I don't need one as public transport and cheap taxis are a good enough substitute. Luxury, self improvement and materialism is a way of life here. I know it seems a little gauche, but because your basics (nice housing, savings &amp; financial security) and optionals (investments) are already taken care of the only way you can possibly be happier is to party, make deep friendships, buy nice things and continuously improve yourself.

Because that's the appropriate, justified 'use of force' and correct application of training/good practice/what works. Different situations, different actions!

We're going a bit off-topic talking about collusion and cross-referencing statements etc, I'm sure both of us could discuss that separately for hours and there are certainly arguments on both sides. The increased use of body-worn video should assist greatly with the high level of accountability we rightfully expect; as I'm sure you'll appreciate, witness-based evidence is notoriously unreliable at the best of times but we do have one of the best (if not the best) armed police in the world - the number of shots fired/people shot vs callout statistics should underline that fact.

You could have beaten your burglar up... but then you'd have had to justify why that was necessary, the same as police do! Interestingly, in your example, CJIA 2008 gives householders the right to use 'disproportionate force when defending themselves against intruders into the home', so you actually have MORE rights there!

I sincerely wish everyone was as compliant as yourself in that case... it's so much better all round, but unfortunately is not the reality in all cases, and it's those cases that tend to end up discussed like now!

**OP:** First bear in mind the agent need not always transfer the deposit, some schemes allow the agent to purchase a kind of insurance policy and keep the deposit themselves. Make sure they have not done this instead before saying anything. If the deposit is truely not protected the law is very much on your side, but the process to bring a claim is a bit complex on deposit compensation. Further, only bringing this up in response to a different dispute would likely make you a lot less sympathetic. So you may wish to try to use the threat of it as leverage. Don't start proceedings without warning - first because it costs money, and second because the courts don't like that, you should try to resolve a dispute before starting an action.

White people are more likely to go into politics- More white people means that there is more of a chance for that race to be elected.

Also running for election is expensive, so you have to be wealthy to be able to afford to run for election. That's why Bankers etc go in and not people who work at Iceland.

More men go into politics than women, again more men=more of a chance.

More middle aged people go into politics and stand for election compared to other groups so again you get more of a chance of them getting elected. 

There is also a very basic form of tribalism going on. People are more likely to vote someone in of the same colour than another race. 

There is no pass for ""All the wealthy, white, middle-aged men get a pass"" its just the situation in politics itself.

If people want more black people, women etc into politics, then they should stand themselves. Be the change they want to be and see, they can't just sit around and say something is wrong.

Still think Moreno needs proper competition in his spot. Flanno will be coming off after a long time out, Enrique is useless and Moreno's flank is going to be continuously exploited by opponents. 

Keep Lucas at all costs, develop Can in his role for the future or get a new defensive midfielder in if that is not going to happen.

I'd sit him down, and just talk to him. It's obvious from the interview that he's just a young lad who's trying to cope with an increasing amount of pressure and expectation from fans, the club and the media, and that he maybe doesn't have the guidance he needs to deal with it right now. 

If he stays, he's guaranteed first time football here; he's a very good player, nearly great, and he's an important aspect in our attack. We may have finished sixth this season, and that really is something that could put doubt in the mind of young footballer about the future direction of the club, but it was a bedding in period that was destined to happen (and that we were naive and stupid enough to not believe would happen). 

That said, it is all about what Sterling wants. As the transfer window rumbles on and City get increasingly desperate in their search for home grown players, they'll no doubt up their offer to around ¬£50M and Liverpool will probably take that should nothing else have been negotiated.

null,false,rjolly,lfc68,,null,"Well you still haven't answered the question as to why you think Wisdom is better suited at CB. Whether you criticise Rodgers or Pulis or whoever they and you would assume the coaches saw Wisdom as better suited to a RB position. The same when he has played for England's youth teams. Maybe Wisdom himself feels more comfortable at RB. There is not any reason to believe he would be better changing position. It isnt like Carra. Carra as you said was a utility player. He played out of position at LB and Cm and played gamed at RB and CB. Wisdom has never been a utility player so unlike Carra it is unlikely that every one who has ever coached him would play him in a position he is not suited too. All of these coaches and managers being more qualified than you. However that doesn't mean your opinion is wrong perhaps he is better suited to CB. But you still havent explained why you think so? There must be a reason.

Also I don't agree with you that he would get a game at CB. I also don't understand your point. You are saying Skrtel get games so Wisdom should? Skrtel is much better than Wisdom and isn't a bad defender. Season before the one that just ended he was one of our best players. Why would Wisdom get a game at CB. When we have Skrtel, Sakho and Lovern. Toure signed a new contract. Ilori and Gomez too, although we don't know whether they will stay with the squad or not. But Wisdom if played CB would be behind all of them in the pecking order. And what has Martin Kelly got to do with anything? He played a few games at CB for Liverpool but you're right he didn't get many games at CB. Mostly because it wasn't his primary position. He was much better suited to fullback. When has he proved to be suited to CB? Not at Palace, he has played mostly LB and RB for them? And the same guy who you praised for playing Carra at CB was also the one to get Kelly playing at RB(Rafa). And he was right.

I'm not basing my entire opinion of Manquillo on one game. But I just used that game to show that he suffers from exactly what you criticised Flanno for, and it was such a shocking piece of defending. I think Manquillo is decent he has talent and you would imagine he would only improve. I think that we should keep him, especially considering Flanno has been out for so long and will continue to be out longer. All I was saying is that Flanno has shown more than Manquillo has. I don't think Manquillo has shown much or been particularly great in a game. But he had limited game time and so I'm all for keeping him. Just don't see why you would say he is better than Flanagan. And you also have to consider why we even have him. Atletico don't rate him, they are trying to get rid of him. That doesn't make him a bad player. Atletico have better players than us anyway but it is just a thought. Anyway you keep saying that Flanno has been poor and you have said that he is constantly making mistakes and is a liability. But again you still haven't explained why you think so?

The Doctor comments that he ""once did something similar with a charge of distronic radiation on a Zygon ship in Scotland"" when explaining Nikola Tesla's allowing half a million volts to pass through him. (TV:Terror of the Zygons)

After returning to his time he reverse engineers the Tardis into the Tesla Time Machine. It turns into a DW / Tesla / HG Wells mashup.

In the Second Civil War, he was also very lenient with the Scots, seeing them as good god-fearing people who were mislead by Charles.

With Ireland he was pretty Brutal. Owen Roe O'Neil's uprising and the inflated figures of the massacre of Protestants that circulated in 1640-1 was one of the reasons Parliament got all in a huff about Charles being unwilling to raise and army so tried to get powers to raise one themselves IIRC.

He hated papists and the puritan faction that came to dominate the New Model Army by the time of Cromwell's Irish campaigns were the type that actually believed that Laud's prayer book was crypto-catholic and that the catholic agents had a great influence over the king.

I don't know much about it, but I don't think it can be pigeon-holed as ethnic hatred towards the Irish that came after it (even though they were certainly looked down on as backward), as it often tends to be framed these days. I reckon what went down in Ireland was due to the fact it was more overtly Catholic. He went after the Anglo-Irish, new settlers and the Irish beyond the pale equally.

The reason we have such a massive welfare bill is mostly accounted for by two things:

- The NHS (18% - 135Bn)
- Pensions (21% - 157bn)

The biggest - Pensions - has been actively protected by the current government via Triple Lock security, and giving early access.

 This is at the same time that they are also cutting the support frameworks for the young people who are struggling to get jobs. 

If the government wanted to seriously cut the welfare bill, then they could start by means-testing pensions, or other forms of targeting. Instead, they have successfully created a discourse of '*skivers*' and '*scroungers*' and targeted them instead, which will be making some savings but that pales in comparison to pension spending, which could make far more sense if they were genuinely bothered about reducing the deficit. 

Another thing that suggests it's more of a moral, than a practical desire is that there's been a reduction in investment in recent years (trains, for example, and reducing the training for young people while increasing the WorkFare scheme which is a short-term solution to skills shortages) which then goes onto create long term productivity issues, which is what we are now starting to see with us fall behind, massively, USA and Germany.

Guzan: regains his confidence. Hopefully he plays well with the USA and begins to get his presence and instinct back. I'm happy with Guzan as the man between the posts for us.

Defense: I would love to see three centre backs because I think that Richards has the ability to play in the middle but can move wide if needed. Clark or Okore in the middle, and Clark or Baker playing on the left side. I know Richards has the strength to play inside, and Baker and Clark have experience as both centre and wide backs. 

Midfield: I think with Gueye coming in, we have massive potential for central midfield. Hopefully we hang on to Delph, and can play Sanchez as DM, Delph and Gueye just ahead of him, with one of Gil, Grealish, Sinclair or Bacuna playing behind the striker (AM/#10 role). 

Wings: we have all the talent we need here. Gil, Sinclair, Grealish and Bacuna can all play on the wings, although in my mind, Bacuna and Sinclair are the best options because they both have the ability to go box to box and help defend as wing backs.

Striker: Benteke.

This all works out to a general 5-4-1/3-4-3 mixed formation. I'm on mobile so the formatting may be fucked but...

            Guzan

    Richards-Clark-Baker

            Sanchez

        Gueye-Delph

            Grealish

    Bacuna-Benteke-Sinclair

With Bacuna and Sinclair moving all down the wings.

One of the benefits of this formation is that is extremely adaptable. Grealish can switch with either of the wingers, and Bacuna could go back to full back to switch the shape up. 

Gardener, Okore and Kozak would all be awesome subs too. 

My fear with this formation is that Benteke will not get the support he needs. If Benteke is too lonely up front, I think Sherwood should experiment with playing Benteke and Kozak together. Although they are probably not the best suited duo (best case would be Benteke with Austin just ahead of him) but it would be interesting to see Benteke (with his flick-ons and hold up play) with a proper target man ahead of him. 

It would probably look like:

            Richards-Clark-Baker

    Bacuna-Gueye-Delph-Sinclair

                    Grealish

              Benteke-Kozak
