I think the Tottenham game was a good example of how we're actually better with Stevie on the bench; we started to take more control of possession and ended up scoring twice (while conceding one again). I agree that Brendan knows Stevie's strengths and will play to them, not just as a player but as our captain and leader, but I highly doubt we'll see him start week in week out. We saw just after the christmas period that he was being started about every second game, and this was at the point where we just were playing every weekend or so, not midweek. I think that Stevie can make a huge contribution coming off the bench, he'll be fresh legs and just coming on will give the players a huge lift, but I just think we lose too much energy chasing the ball when he starts. It's better to use him to kill off a struggling team if we need some extra punch then try to have him be effective for the whole game while making Henderson or the other 10, so to speak, do almost all the pressing for both of them. He'll definitely start featuring in the starting 11 in coming weeks, so I hope for the team's sake you're right and I'm wrong for how he'll perform against teams with a high numbers/tempo midfield. He'll be able to do a job against teams that sit back though, because even though he excels at long balls he's actually still quite clever in tight spaces as well, just maybe not quite as nimble as he once was.

Watch out for that characteristic Scottish walker - the very old man with knobbly knees. These people have been out on the hill every weekend for sixty years and appear to be made of ambulatory oak.

Irrelevant. 

The whole issue is that manufacturers are trying to force you to upgrade, so the excuse ""well the upgrade is better"" is completely and utterly redundant. 

I can buy a Nokia 3210, and be guaranteed it will still work (more or less) yet any phone I buy today is unlikely to last more than 3 - in most cases simply because they're built in a way that makes it near impossible for the user to actually do anything about the problem. 

&gt;It doesn't matter if obsolescence is planned or not because the nature of the industry means it will be obsolete within a few years anyway.

Something is only obsolete when it no longer functions, or it's function has been entirely replaced. A phone is a phone, it is not obsolete until we replace the technology it runs on. 

Same for all TV's made in the past 30 years, they all still function, or can. So they're not obsolete.

Just because you personally, see them as obsolete because you want the latest shiny product, doesn't mean I want to fork out a few thousand quid every few years to upgrade all my electronics because the manufacturer decided it's time for me to upgrade.",null,0,null,1425428280,null,0,1425428565,0,cp3imoe,null,t3_2xronb,null,t1_cp3imoe,null,t1_cp2sxl9,null,null,null,1427564662,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Honestly if it continues for another 5 or so years I can imagine clients asking for a male operative under the table.

After passing that I then had my actual interview,  my best advice for that would be read the competencies for the job thoroughly and come up with examples of where you've utilised that, have several as they might ask slightly off track questions. 

You'll be judged basically entirely on the competencies so just study them and you'll likely be fine. I found the assessment centre to be a breeze but again mine was telephony so YMMV. If you can adlib well, have a decent telephone number and the ability to write a summary, you'll be fine.

Whenever the klaxon sounds it would be easy for Stephen to segue into ""Interestingly enough..."" and proceed to explain the facts and how the common misconception came about as normal. Instead of ""Qi"" we get ""i. e."" which of course also means ""For example"" or ""That is to say"" which is just an excellent added bonus.

- Has only scored one penalty (technically not, i know), but Aguero has scored a few
- Costa and Aguero score a lot of 'meaningless goals' i.e. when they're already 2-0 and they score a 3rd. It's a lot easier to score a goal to make it 3-0 than to make it 2-1 as Harry Kane so often does.
- Cisse would not maintain that ratio (in my opinion) if he started matches against refreshed defenders and tired as they tired. It's a lot easier to score against tired defenders when you haven't played all game (see Edin Dzeko's record after coming on as a sub vs starting). Same as Lampard.
- Similar to the second point, but Kane plays in a team that is lesser quality than Costa and Aguero and a team that has scored less goals overall (either tactics or skill (or both) are less attacking) which hinders Kane's performance.

TLDR; Kane is fucking good.

Also, his agent saying he hasn't signed with MLS is a signal he has not entered the allocation process. You cannot do one without doing the other.

Additionally, LA Galaxy has a ton of allocation money they have been saving for multiple seasons to sign a player that would be over the DP threshold to a contract under the DP threshold. This is a bit complicated, but in short it means that the move for Lletget would make zero sense because they've made previous moves to put themselves into a position to sign someone above Lletget's caliber. Thinking LA would ""settle"" for Lletget shows very little understanding of LA's position within MLS. LA is ""the"" team in MLS. They are the most successful franchise in the league, by a wide margin. They don't make moves for unproven players.

LA has too much money invested in their current allocation position to waste that position on Sebastian Lletget (no offense to Seb). Think of it this way: The players currently bought with allocation money by teams above LA this season: Mix Diskerud (starter from FC Rosenborg, full US International) and Sacha Kljestan (starter for CL side Anderlecht, full US International). You're kidding yourself if you think LA would look at those two moves and think money spent on Lletget would be money well spent.

If you're moving here there's probably not much point keeping the insurance unless it's free or there are some benefits that would justify the cost, perhaps a no-claims discount or loyalty bonus that you'd lose if you stopped your account. I'd probably brings some medication with you just to tide you over while you settle in here. The only time I can see it being necessary to have health insurance is if you end up with a health problem that the NHS won't prescribe certain medications for but that's not to say your US insurer would cover either. I'm thinking stupidly expensive cancer treatments. Also, if you have a health problem that isn't urgent but requires an operation you'll probably get treated quicker in the US but you'll probably end up getting it done here or waiting until you return home.

4. I think Credit Unions are a bit different in the US. There's an excellent website, Moneysavingexpert.com, that covers pretty much everything money related in Britain and it's explained like you're five. It'll be a very handy thing to read up on before you arrive. If you're going to be here a while, and it seems like it, I think opening an account here is sensible otherwise you're going to get hit with fees every time you use your US accounts.

Look over at the USA and compare Costco to Walmart. Costco pays its employees a living wage. Walmart (despite the recent cosmetic wage hike) does not. The state subsidises Walmart by, in effect, providing cheap labour. This not only costs public money but also warps the true nature of competition. 

So, if your business model is built around subsidised labour at taxpayers' expense to make a profit, it's really not a business at all. It's a drain on society. 

There are plenty of studies around that show that raising the minimum wage actually assists economies because:

a) it puts more disposable cash into people's pockets, which they spend in the local economy. **This creates more jobs**.

b) it reduces taxpayer liability, which can result in either lower taxes or better spending on social services like education/health etc, or actual reductions in taxes (which, let's face it, is what everyone wants)

1) The Doctor is *looking* for trouble.  This was more established in the classic series, but there were several times where his Companions started voicing suspicions about how he kept ""accidentally"" taking them into the middle of civil wars and monster attacks and he would act very injured and over-defensive even though he was suspiciously well-informed about the situation.

2) The TARDIS is looking for trouble.  This will be expanded upon in a few seasons if you keep watching.

3) There's trouble everywhere.  The four-dimensional universe is so full of problems constantly going on that the Doctor can set down pretty much anywhere, anytime, and find something awful going on and stop it.  The only reason you ever feel safe is because you aren't aware your neighbor is actually an alien overlord in exile building up an interplanetary death machine in his basement, and the Doctor's going to show up and stop him before he can fire it off.

Oh, and my wife reminded me -

4) Trouble looks for the Doctor.  There are several races who *despise* the Doctor on a level comparable with religious zealotry.  Some have access to time travel, others are just prodigious across time and space, while still others will intentionally set up problematic situations as a smoke screen to lure him in and try to kill him.",null,0,null,1425439677,null,0,false,0,cp3p553,null,t3_2xv80l,null,t1_cp3p553,null,t3_2xv80l,null,null,null,1427567713,null,23,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,23,null

Of course, many Muslims *are* standing up to extremism. Even the Daily Mail was quoting Emwazi going on about how extremism was bad, how terrorism led to innocent people dying and if he could he'd undo that and so on. Although that was in his first MI5 interview (he claimed).

You assume the choice is faster change or slower change, but all going in the same pre-decided far-left direction. Pro-tip pal, the Whig theory of history isn't true.

Social change isn't a one way street to the future you and your mates from Socialist Worker dream about.

Also the left is the great purveyor of name calling; racist, sexist, misogynist, homophobe, bigot, patriarchy, rape culture blah blah blah; all of these are used to label people the left wants to silence as ""evil"" so they don't have to deal with their arguments.

- read the two long lists of articles on skincare from a dermatology perspective that I posted over on /r/rosaceahelp/. Then start reading ingredients lists of all your products (ideally even dental and haircare because the residues get on your face)

There are many reasons that Singapore's policy is effective; one of the biggest reasons is that crime is generally very low in Singapore and that is due to their very effective policing. Another reason would be that it is a city state (roughly the third the size of London), very prosperous and their isn't a culture of drug consumption.

It was drilled into our heads from a very early age that if we messed with drugs, the criminal penalties were dire; The prison conditions were small and terrible. The corporal punishment (caning) was extremely severe and the threshold to be eligible for the death penalty was incredibly low. 

We were also regularly shown worst case scenarios of what would happen if you consumed drugs; examples such as a woman who had prepared and cooked her baby thinking it was a chicken. 

The best case scenario would be being kicked out of the country. 

Perhaps if the UK emulated those countries policies to a T it would have similarly low levels of drug consumption but I don't think we want to live in that sort of society and I don't think its worth the cost.

It describes an incredibly psychic group which does meddle with Time Travel where there is no privacy or freedom of thought. It is ruled over by the pythias. This to me doesn't seem particularly like a Human civilisation and would put a little doubt on this theory.

Point 1. Well according to Time's cricible there were Time Travel experiments before the Three came into power.

Point 2. Only really a few mentions in the books but I've already mentioned the experimentation

Point 3. I think you're completely right on this point

Point 4. I don't remember Gallofrey being described as hostile to life And the Citadel is High up in the mountains and the stuff shown in Deadly Assasin appears to be Desert which would explain the lack of life. I think the reluctance to leave the Citadel is more of a propaganda thing to stop people leaving. This fits with your point three.

Point 5. I think we most likely have to accept mentions as we haven't seen much of Gallifrey and there is no reason for any of the characters to lie. Also just because there isn't life on Gallifrey doesn't mean there bever was and the Time Lords are a very old society and could have destroyed the eco system.

Point 6. I would put this down to low budget also it wasn't just greek but also mathematical notation IIRC. If you decide this is significant i have no point about this one.

Point 7. I like the Big Finish answer for this where Rassilon because he is a collosal space racist and was having trouble with non hominoid species went back in time and encouraged the development of Hominoid fors. There is also the Fendahl which caused humanity to become Hominoid and the may have got to early Gallifreyans.

I think my main reason for disliking this theory is that it feels lazy to make the Doc a very advanced human as his motivations then become save earth and not just i like it and have fun there. I much prefer the latter. It also make the Universe feel far smaller as two big groups in Doctor Who are made the same.

From a Japanese point of view they have similar success as Singapore but they don't have the corporal or capital punishment which seem to be the worst things about the Singaporean system. Tokyo is also way larger than London and the national population is double. There is also a low overall crime rate there and there isn't a drug culture (but that last point is chicken and egg).

I'm not saying that prohibition is the right way forward, just that prohibition *can* be done effectively and just arguing that consumption has fallen in Portugal doesn't mean that their system is necessarily the right one or the only one.

First of all, I would like to point out that I never stated that The Doctor or any modern Gallifreyans know about this, I just stated that it might be true. I think that it would be interesting if The Doctor is unknowingly saving the Gallifreyan race on many of his adventures. I also feel being descendants of a race they don't associate with makes the Gallifreyans more interesting and not less.

And now, to address your points.

1. Humans are shown using early time travel devices. These could be early forms of Gallifreyan time capsules. Additionally, The Pythias could be descendants of humans as well.

4. In The Invasion of Time, Gallifrey is described as being hostile to life. Though you could be right about it being propaganda.

5. True. I suppose The Invasion of Time agrees with your point. Interestingly enough, some animals are mentioned by Gallifreyans throughout the series. I always thought that animals were brought over as pets or livestock.

6. It's not my biggest point, but it is an odd coincidence. Especially it is an actual significant mathematical notation, as that means some of human culture could have survived long enough to go to Gallifrey.

7. Even so, there are so many hominid species in the universe, and humans and Gallifreyans look extremely similar. Most species (especially after the introduction of better effects) look very different from humans, but Gallifreyans don't.

If you take option Two, the number 666 (or 616, according to some translations) refers to Emperor Nero, which means that Nero was The Beast and the ""end of the world"" predicted in the story is actually the Fall of the Roman Empire.

Of course, the Doctor met Nero once.  Nero had plans to improve the city of Rome, by first clearing out a rundown section of town, and then building new Temples to the Gods on the site.

Couple of thoughts that I had. First, Mario is simultaneously as much a victim of his past as he is of his present. He's judged for past sins as well as past successes. Any thread or blog post or twitter conversation about him will always include phrases like 'untapped potential', 'could be world class' and 'all of the talent.' There's no real debate that all those things are true, but he's also incredibly easy to criticise because, as the author says, he shoots on sight, he's not always aware and he can cause some drama. He's as hindered by the player he was as much as he is by the player he is or could be, if that makes sense at all. 

That being said, Rodgers has treated him unfairly. It's not Mario's fault that Sturridge went down. It's not his fault that Lovren forgot how to play football, that the system stopped working, that Lallana didn't hit the ground running, that Coutinho took a while to hit his stride. He's very much a scapegoat for the early season troubles. 

However, my other thought is that more than being a scapegoat, I think Balotelli is being used as a pawn. I think we can all agree that Rodgers did not want Balotelli. He's made that abundantly clear. But, think back to what he said in Boston after we played Milan. He said, ""I can categorically tell you that Mario Balotelli will not be a Liverpool player."" Two weeks later, he was one. Most managers in that situation would just say that they're always assessing players and that Mario is talented, or that they admire Balotelli but won't comment on transfers. 

If you'll indulge my tin hat for a minute, I think Brendan was trying to send a signal to whoever at the club was pushing Balotelli on him. The tactic obviously failed, but I think Rodgers' continued attempts to distance himself from and criticise Mario are a continuation of that same thought. I doubt the likes of James Pearce or Tony Barrett would comment on it because they won't bite the hand that feeds them, but there's clearly something not 100% right behind the scenes at Anfield right now. The sacking of the senior scouting team in the autumn proves it. 

All in all, this makes me feel even more sorry for Mario. He's being held up as the unwitting and unwilling poster child for the failures of a crew that isn't quite sure what they want in the transfer window, or how to get it. He's frustrating, mercurial and a lot of other things but whether you think he should be starting every Premiership game or with the U21s, he doesn't deserve this treatment.

null,false,davidcvd,lfc12,,null,"You might be right about the politics but one thing that Rodgers has shown since he came  to the club is that he's not petty or stubborn enough to keep a player out of the team based on performances. 

He took a pop at Borini in the summer transfer window but has still given Borini chances this season. Same can be said about Skrtel last season and Henderson the season before that. The bottom line on any discussion about Mario is that if he was contributing he'd be starting every week and he hasn't been doing that. The fall back argument then is that we're not changing our formation to get the most out of him and play him alongside Sturridge - but he's played alongside Tevez, Aguero, Dzeko, Eto, Milito and El Sharaway and has never set the world on fire with his contribution. The season City won the league he had one assist which when you're playing in an attack like they had shows that maybe it doesn't matter who he plays alongside or in what formation he lines up. 

I'd love Mario to succeed at Liverpool and really believe that if he was as good as people believe he is he'd be playing. It might be that he simply isn't as good as the reputation given to him by Mourinho and Mancini suggests. Football history is full of players who arrived on the scene with massive reputations from their early years who faded away. I hope Mario isn't one of them but even his agent is questioning what to do to get him to perform and acknowledging publicly that this is Marios last chance to make it at a massive club. It can't always be someone else's fault

Well, yes and no - there wasn't really a tactical ""battle"", because City set up as if tactics didn't matter. 

It's not just that the use of a 4-4-2 left them outnumbered in midfield, it's the personnel making up that 4-4-2. Both fullbacks like to get forward, one CB is very aggressive in his marking and quick to step out from the back, neither striker drops deep to help defend, and 3 of the four midfielders - including one of the two CM's - offer very little defensive work rate. 

It's ludicrous how heavily they rely on Fernandinho - a player whose preferred role is box-to-box rather than midfield destroyer - to do the dirty work in midfield. It's just not an approach that can work in big games.

Also, they should have started Navas, and tested Liverpool more directly down our undermanned flanks, rather than relying on Silva and Nasri coming inside into a well-stocked central area where they were up against Allen, Henderson, Can and Lovren.",null,0,null,1425449005,null,0,false,0,cp3ts0k,null,t3_2xuj2m,null,t1_cp3ts0k,null,t3_2xuj2m,null,null,null,1427569947,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

Big difference between language and religion.  Try going a week without communicating.

&gt;It's not arrogant to want to give people practical awareness of what that means.

It's arrogant to do it every day during a child's primary educational life and to teach them to be a Christian. It obviously worked for you.

Then make a better one. The two are not remotely similar.

&gt;&gt;it isn't fine to reach children to be religious.

&gt;If you sing a hymn but don't believe in God, is that being religious?

Children from the age of four being made to sing hymns and pray do not yet have the necessary skills to decide whether they are religious. Making them take part in religious ceremonies like this every day is indoctrination. You can repeat however many times you want that it isn't and each time you would still be wrong.

&gt;&gt;It isn't necessary to make children pray to one god everyday to give them that understanding.

&gt;If you want to understand a religion you have to try living it. It's like suggesting we teach children about swimming by standing on the edge of the pool and looking in at what others are doing.

Just like with your language analogy the two are not similar. You are giving undue importance to religion. It isn't as necessary as you think it is. 

&gt;&gt;Don't talk down to me like that.

&gt;Just replying to what you wrote. Being sarcastic is not the same as being patronising (that means talking down to someone). 

That's a very bad habit you've got. Don't talk down to me like that. 

You were being patronising with your ""wow"" statement as if I had missed some fundamental truth. That is your arrogance.

&gt;You expressed surprise that something non-factual would be considered important. So do you think non factual things can be important or not?

I am expressing frustration (not surprise - I have been through the system remember) that specifically the Christian religion is given such importance in schools that worship of it is taught every day. 

At risk if repeating myself, but repeating myself seems to be necessary, it is OK to teach about religion, which is itself non factual. It isn't OK to teach children, who by nature are at a formative stage, to worship the Christian god so often.",null,0,null,1425455811,null,0,false,0,cp3w06e,null,t3_2xogiq,null,t1_cp3w06e,null,t1_cp3vc8m,null,null,null,1427570986,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I think Dawkins, Harris, Dennett et al. accept this (with the caveat that it's a logical fallacy for moderates to cherry pick which parts of the perfect Word of God they believe in).  However, the problem is that moderates help the Abrahamic religions to plead that they're a special case in society.

If someone tells you that they believe in unicorns because unicorns exist in a book, it's socially acceptable to tell them it's nonsense based on the available evidence; but it's not acceptable to do exactly the same thing with professed religious beliefs, because you might offend all the awfully nice people that overhear you.  As a result of this social problem, we allow religion to buy its way into our school system, affect public policy etc.

I don't think anyone is saying that moderates should be punished for the actions of fundamentalists; but that they should take a good long look at the damage that belief does when it masquerades as fact.  No-one wants to think that they're close to fundamentalists, but the truth is, the fundamentalists believe in the fundamentals of a given religion.  If the fundamentals disgust you, then why bother believing at all, moderate or otherwise?

The electors are mainly tied to a particular party but there are some independent electors. In most states the system works such that the party that has the most votes overall gets all the seats in the electoral college (Winner takes all system). 

Once the electors are elected they each have one vote for President and one vote for Vice-President. The candidate for each office that gets an ""Absolute Majority"" (currently 270 votes) is elected to the office.

The elections for the Senate and House of Representatives are different - Senators are elected every six years, but their election dates are staggered so that within the entire house no more than 1/3 of the seats are up for election at any one time, and no state ever has both candidates up for election at the same time (unless one of the candidates steps down mid-term in which case their seat must be filled).

Contact and support is readily available but the bottom line is it's distance learning so you're going to need to need motivation. Both my current modules have four each of online and face to face tutorials per year, four ongoing and four final pieces of coursework. That's a tiny amount of contact and submitted coursework but the work that backs it up is substantial and meaty and you'll have to put the hours in if you want results. As a pisshead slacker managing my motivation has been quite challenging.

Also, language learning at a distance is, um, interesting, and presumably that applies to other disciplines too. Not having daily contact with a classroom/laboratory/studio, tutors, and other students is a much bigger impediment than I first imagined, but not insuperable. But it will require a considerable change of attitude.

Visit the vast [OU website](http://www.open.ac.uk/) and have a nose around, request a prospectus, but more importantly ring their helpline on 0300 303 5303 and ask to have a general discussion with a former or current student about what it's like. They seem to understand the specific problems of distance learning very well and the support structures are robust.

**Lloris** - No question

**Rose** - Our better left sided defensive option in my opinion, I feel he's better than Davies because he offers more going forward too. 

**Vertonghen** - No question

**Fazio** - Because I feel we miss him on set pieces, his height and strength adds a lot to our defence, he just needs to work on his discipline.

**Dier** - Currently playing very consistently, I feel he's earned his spot.

**Walker** - Almost always someone you can depend on, he especially offers a lot going forward, but he's got the strength and speed to track back when needed.

**Bentaleb** - Probably our best midfielder recently, I feel he'll be an important member of the squad for many years to come.

**Chadli** - He surprises me a lot and I think he's a really good player, he's only improved over his mediocrity last season to become one of our most important players.

**Eriksen** - despite some mediocre performances lately he's come up with the goods for us a lot and was probably our best purchase with the Bale money, a must have in the team.

**Townsend/Lamela** - I feel this is our weakest spot on the pitch, Lamela is unreliable and loses the ball a lot while Townsend often comes off as a one trick pony. However, one thing I really like about Townsend on the right is people get distracted by him and Walker, which opens up the left side of the pitch for Rose, how often have we seen him in an absurd amount of space this season?

**Kane** - No justification needed.

I imagine this set up would fix our leaky defense while still providing the attacking high pressing game Pochettino likes to play, with width provided by Rose/Walker but support from Bentaleb in a box to box role.",null,0,null,1425458544,null,0,1425478791,0,cp3worm,null,t3_2xvv72,null,t1_cp3worm,null,t3_2xvv72,null,null,null,1427571306,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

That's why studies like this are needed - you don't necessarily see the knock on effects of your financial interactions.

You mention that the Russian and Polish builders who have done work for you have done a better job and been paid less. This could lead to a lot more demand for work which would otherwise have been unaffordable (or just poor value) which means that unemployment goes down while highly paid jobs are created, say, doing the accounts for all of these builders and managing the construction firms who send them out.

These builders might also be spending their money in ways which boost aggregate demand and wages more than the way in which the previous higher paid builders were spending theirs. Similarly, the money you've saved might be spent in a way which also boosts demand and wages in other sectors.

&gt;

&gt;The __Tennyson Trail__ is a 15-mile walk from [Carisbrooke Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carisbrooke_Castle) to [The Needles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Needles) on the [Isle of Wight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Wight). The route goes through Bowcombe Down, [Brighstone Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighstone_Forest), [Mottistone Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mottistone_Down), Brook Down, [Afton Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afton_Down), [Freshwater Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater,_Isle_of_Wight), [Tennyson Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennyson_Down), and West High Down to [Alum Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alum_Bay).  The name of the trail comes from poet [Alfred Lord Tennyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Tennyson,_1st_Baron_Tennyson), a former resident of the Isle of Wight.

&gt;There are several points of interest along the walk, including The Tennyson Monument on [Tennyson Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennyson_Down), [Farringford House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farringford_House) and [The Needles Battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Needles_Battery) which overlooks [The Needles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Needles). 

&gt;The walk was completed on 25 May 2001.  However in December 2002, the National Trust revealed that illegal 4x4 drivers and riders were destroying the paths, threatening the trail.

**Age:** 17

**Position:** Central midfielder. Ideally you combine him with a holding midfielder and play him as a deep-lying playmaker.

The next big thing coming out of the Anderlecht-academy. Made is debut last year and was very impressive. Very strong on the ball, great vision and passing skills. It shows in his game that he is this young because he makes mistakes from time to time. Misplacing simple passes because he's not paying enough attention to what is happening. [But then, from time to time, he'll do this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7CLkrocAyA) I think he really has the potential to become world class.

**Leander Dendocker**

**Age:** 19

**Position:** Holding midfielder but has shown he can play as a central defender as well. 

Just made his debut in the first team this season and has been phenomenal. He absolutely dominates the midfield defensively and this allowes the other Anderlecht-midfielders to go forward. His playstyle is comparable to Matic's, recovering a lot of balls with spider-like tackles. Although he is praised for his defense, [you don't want give him the space to shoot the ball as well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQF5HvGn4Do) [He also scored this beauty just last weekend.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewnyLQuM3x4) He's had a better season than Tielemans so far and it doesn't look like he's going to slow down.

null,false,hebsevenfour,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"I'm not religious, but the ""logical fallacy to pick and chose"" argument is absurd, and frustrating because the people making it are intelligent enough to know it. It suits Dawkins et all to attack fundamentalists, because it's easier, so they try to argue (as fundamentalists do) that fundamentalism is the only true expression of a faith. 

Bullshit. Utter utter bullshit, and they know it. Fundamentalism in most faiths is a later rather than original expression. For those faiths that believe in a god they are usually dealing with trying to express in words something that is inexpressible by man who is said to be flawed and prone to error. We didn't even get belief in biblical literalism till the reformation for goodness sake, and Dawkins wants to pretend it's somehow more authentic than non-literal adherence. 

It is intellectually lazy and dishonest to pretend that fundamentalists are a more accurate representation of any given faith. Faiths, like politics, are on a spectrum left to right. The further right you go, the more text based literal and the more focus on organised structure, the further left the more personal spirituality and the less focus on organised worship. All faiths have left and right. Fundamentalists are the far-right and rarely exist at a religions formation (any more than the far-left does). They aren't any truer an expression of a faith than the Mystics on the far-left or the bulk of people in the middle. 

But it's a lot harder for Dawkins et all to tackle what the bulk of religious people actually believe, so they focus on the far-right and pretend that's the only important part of the spectrum.

* [Time-weighted return \(TWR\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-weighted_return), generally used by fund managers as it removes the effect of timing of fund flows.
* [Money-weighted return \(MWR\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return#Money-weighted_rate_of_return), generally used for individual returns (more the question you're asking) as the time of flows does matter (think of this as an individual's *personal return*). This is effectively the IRR.

Simplified formulae are available. An oft-used one is:

(Current Value - Previous Value + Contributions - Distributions) / ( Previous Value - (Distributions * (Average time remaining of period))+(Contributions * (Average time remaining of period))

Do you go the game? I don't mean the condescendingly but watching him live is a completely different animal. His inability to get around the pitch is a liability. He simply doesn't have the legs anymore. He can't cover fullbacks, he can't stretch games, he can't chase players back, he can't get far enough forward to influence the game in the final third because there's a chance that if the opposition breaks, he won't be able to get back in to position.

He plays as a deep lying playmaker who doesn't create any of the play. This was fine last season when he was brilliant at covering the defence but he doesn't seem up to it this season. What's the point of having a deep lying playmaker who has 1 assist in 24 games (2 inc. Europa) and doesn't offer cover for the defence? To put this in to perspective, Darron Gibson, who hasn't started a single Premier League game this season, has one assist already after coming back from injury.

It's not at all.  To be a ""moderate"" or a ""fundamentalist"" or anything in between, you have to ignore some parts of the text and accept others, purely because the Bible is so contradictory.  To say you believe it's the word of God, whom you believe in; and yet to still cherry pick is definitely logically problematic.

&gt;But it's a lot harder for Dawkins et all to tackle what the bulk of religious people actually believe, so they focus on the far-right and pretend that's the only important part of the spectrum.
Intellectually bankrupt.

It's not hard to tackle at all, and he does it regularly.  The bulk of religious people believe total bullshit; and he says this, and he's pilloried for it, because it's a social taboo to say it. 

Sure, you can argue that fundamentalism is just one manifestation of a religion, one interpretation of the text.

Why would it be a boon for the rich? Because you can't have tiered VAT where they have to pay a higher % if you earn more?

I've never really been sure why that is fair. 20% of £1m is 100x more than 20% of £10k^1, so even at a constant rate, the rich pay more.

People conveniently forget that the richest generally are business owners and don't collect their income as salary but as dividend, which attracts a lower rate anyway - it's entirely possible for those people to be paying comparable percentages as low-income households.

Simplifying the entire personal tax system (business being different) down to VAT would arguably make little difference. You might tweak the rates - broaden the scope of VAT-free ""essentials"" and add a higher VAT band for cars &gt;£100k or something.

null,false,rubygeek,null,null,null,"&gt; I suspect that the average low skilled worker isn't generating as much value for the economy as they are taking from it

Firstly, you're making the assumption that a substantial proportion of immigrants are low skilled. I don't think you can substantiate that, unless you put the barrier for ""low skilled"" rather high. 

Secondly you're making the assumption that the salaries for these positions accurately reflects their value to the economy. I don't think we can justify that either.  The reality is that a lot of unskilled and low skilled jobs are subsidised by tax payers because competition for them are high enough that the salaries get driven down *even though* the positions are essential. 

But even assuming the salary accurately reflects value to society, it still isn't as simple as keeping a tally, because the money doesn't evaporate when used once. For starters, the state gets a lot of the cost of benefit payments back in taxes from people paid to carry out the services, VAT on products paid etc. 

This is one of the reasons why the OECD recently pointed out that deep inequality actually hurts the wealthy too: Poorer people spend a far higher proportion of their incoming money, and so they contribute substantially to higher velocity in the economy; the more money falls to the poorer part of the population, the richer the richer part of the population becomes. In other words: Redistribution benefits everyone.

&gt; The cost of ESL kids in our schools is also disproportionately high and has made the public school system a nightmare in high-immigration areas.

One thing you're forgetting in that equation is that every immigrant worker is a new tax payer that the existing population has *not had to pay for* during their youth. Someone else has paid for the cost of their birth and health check ups and schools and nursery subsidies etc.. Someone else has dealt with one of the two major periods of their life when they're a huge net drain on the public coffers. 

The cost of dealing with ESL for that *subset* of immigrants that are bringing school age children with them is never going to get anywhere near the savings from not having to have paid for school for the immigrants in question themselves.

That the government chooses to undefund education is not immigrants fault.

The logical fallacy argument is absurd because it presupposes that the point of a religion is to believe the words written in a book. That's a fundamentalist position to begin with. For most people the point of a religion is to gain spiritual understanding (of God, or the Numinous, or their place in creation, however they define it). A text may or may not be a guide, but except for fundamentalists it is not the point. 

Let's take the bible as an example. Luther used the primacy of the bible as the basis for his break with Rome, unfortunately leaving the protestant tradition with a legacy of biblical liberalism it has largely been moving away from since. But the reformation was late in the history of Christianity. In Catholicism there never was a tradition of biblical literacy. Not least because they well knew that they had put the bible together, picking and choosing the texts from multiple authors some of whom disagreed with each other. It was a source of revelation, but not the source of revelation. 

Catholicism then is quite happy to pick and choose. The bible is written by men, who are sinners and make mistakes. It was put together by men, who are sinners and make mistakes. To scream at a Catholic that they must believe in creationism because it's in the bible utterly misses the point. They aren't trying to understand the bible, they are trying to understand God. So Catholics will just shrug, say that the creation tale is a metaphorical attempt by the author to express a truth about man's imperfect nature, accept evolution, and move on. And Dawkins, laughably, will claim that the later protestant tradition of biblical literalism is somehow more authentic. It isn't, it's just easier for him to criticise.

There's actually some really interesting psychology which comes into play, and you can test it with a friend - get three different coloured sweets and offer them two of them, say a red and a blue, now offer them the sweet they didn't select and the other sweet, if they're offered a red and a green they'll take the green - this is something psychologists have studied a lot, it seems to be that we mentally devalue the option we don't select probably as a device to stop us endlessly dithering about similar options.  When someone feels they've made a choice between weed and civic society it could well be a deep routed psychological impulse that then devalues the concept of 'normal society' in the persons mind, this could be especially pernicious coupled with other psychological impulses such as resentment and resistance against accepting past mistakes. 

Effectively thousands of young adults perception of their place within the social system comes to hinge on a choice between immediate and effective mental-pain relief during that angsty period    of late adolescence or conforming to an impossibly idealistic normiform with a seemingly low likelihood of long-term payoff..  

When a society effectively excludes a group of people those people are going to create their own story to rival that of the one they've been excluded from, this can be seen happening time and time again throughout history, while counter-cultures are an important part of any society they can also be dangerous. Resentment at rejection bouncing between both sides and growing like vibrational waves staking up on top of each other as they bounce back and forth until chaos breaks out and a resonant drone emerges... Maybe if everyone was a bit more inclusive and accepting of each other then the hum would calm down and our society could start to communicate with itself again...?

Lots of the [projects](https://www.gov.uk/transformation) are creating sites/systems that nearly every adult in country will use (registering to vote, renewing a passport etc). Government depts all over the country (not just London) are crying out for people with strong tech/digital skills to help drive all this change.

I work for the digital team in the Skills Funding Agency in Coventry. We have almost 40 digital/tech vacancies. Several looking for Prince 2, which you mentioned you have. Agile experience is also really valuable if you have it. No employee referral bonus for me sadly(!), but PM if you want to know more or check out the [jobs on our blog](https://sfadigital.blog.gov.uk/jobs/). 

In terms of local agencies you could try Blue Skies, 2nd City Resourcing and Pitch – they’re all Brum/West Midlands based and focus on digital jobs.

My main advice though is to make sure your LinkedIn profile is really strong. Connect to lots of *relevant* people who work in the field you’re interested in (I think this is more valuable than just linking to recruiters). Join relevant groups and participate in them. Post regular status updates. Get a couple of decent recommendations (from people with impressive job titles!) for your last few roles.

It's also def worth going to local digital/tech meetup groups.

No I'm British.  I agree that the taboo is much stronger in the US than in this country; but I maintain that you would probably be considered rude if you decided to speak against someone's personal beliefs in conversation, especially if those beliefs are accepted norms like those CofE moderates hold. 
 
&gt;For most people the point of a religion is to gain spiritual understanding (of God, or the Numinous, or their place in creation, however they define it). A text may or may not be a guide, but except for fundamentalists it is not the point.

The trouble with this argument (if you're using to support religion) is that it is essentially arguing that there is no tangible base for any given religion.  If the texts don't define it, then nothing does.  It's a tacit admission that religion is all pure fantasy.  If that was the accepted view of religion, I don't think it would half as prevalent or influential in public life as it is now. 

&gt;The bible is written by men, who are sinners and make mistakes. It was put together by men, who are sinners and make mistakes.

Again, this is true to a point, but I think many Christians and Muslims would take issue with the casting aside of ""revealed wisdom"" like this.   

&gt;So Catholics will just shrug, say that the creation tale is a metaphorical attempt by the author to express a truth about man's imperfect nature, accept evolution, and move on. 

The fallacy still exists here - if it's all just metaphor, then the Bible is just like any other work of fiction, and no-one should take any of it seriously.  Yet they do.   To get around this problem, they go back to the cherry picking - sure, Genesis is a metaphor, but Jesus?  No that guy really lived and was really the Son of God.  OK, maybe Moses didn't really part the Red Sea, but during mass the literal transubstantiation of communion wine and wafers occurs.

&gt;As to your final question ""how can you have any conviction that the interpretation you've chosen is the right one?"" the answer is ""you can't"". Most of the deeply spiritual religious people I have met admit this happily.
That's why they call it faith.

This is pretty wishy-washy though isn't it?  We're back to the unicorns again.  I believe in unicorns, I don't need evidence, because that's what faith is.

Secondly Gerrard wouldn't displace Coutinho or Sterling for me right now (maybe not even Ibe when he returns). Allen has shown that he can give a similar contribution to Lucas, Can is an option there too.

 The only spot I can imagine is alternating with Lallana and Gerrard didn't look that comfortable in the last game he played there, he wasn't involved enough. The other factor is that each game Gerrard plays will be part of his farewell tour and it has the danger of overshadowing what has become a critical run-in. In some respects, his absence from the team has been a positive. I'd keep him on the bench unless the players mentioned have a serious dip. Bring him on in the last 20 minutes.

null,false,ex-turpi-causa,eng-GreaterLondon,London Liberal,null,"&gt; Isn't that the whole point you were driving in your post. You are proposing an ideology that certain speech should be limited i.e. no opposition be allowed.

Government has a legitimate interest in regulating speech where that speech is liable to result in actions and/or harm. 

Just because speech is limited in a variety of ways (it already is in the civil and criminal jurisdictions) does not mean that ideas are being suppressed. Freedom of speech is simultaneous about encouraging those voices, protecting them, and making sure they occur in the appropriate setting(s). The only things being suppressed are *actions* resulting from speech which are widely considered illegitimate abuses of the right to free speech in the first place. (e.g. defamation, harassment, blackmail, incitement to violence, public order offences and so on) 

Now, there is a slippery slope argument wherever one wishes to find one. Nevertheless, there are essentially only three real approaches one can take to free speech theory. In light of the realities of the real world, it's quite obvious that the most preferable approach (and indeed the prevailing one) is the [balancing approach.](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/zenger/freespeech.htm)

Basically you lay out cards in a pyramid, face down, 4,3,2,1 on each level. Each person has to turn over a card in each layer (so first person picks one from the 4 layer, second from the 3, third from the 2 etc) and if its a face card that person drinks and the card is overlaid with a new card, and the next player starts from the bottom again. If you get to the top then you nominate someone else to drink (this only happens maybe once for a deck of cards).

You drink on about every 1 in 4 turns, it feels like gambling so its exciting and everyone gets completely destroyed in minutes.

null,false,WindyCOYS,flair8,,null,"&gt;I think your more important point was ""But the competition has been good for us, and we might not have the Harry Kane that we do were it not for this season’s Europa League."" This is why Europa is absolutely vital for us: we need those extra fixtures to help us develop players, to hone our game plans, and to allow second-choice players runs in competitive matches. Yes, it's true, it does present problems of rotation and it challenges our depth. But, if we have any aspirations of making the Champions League, we need to be able to stand the rigors of multiple competitions.

I said as much on [The Fighting Cock podcast](http://www.thefightingcock.co.uk/2015/03/s4e30-dogs-of-war/) this week funnily enough. I think it's an opportunity to use and develop the squad, and I think Pochettino has *mostly* done that well this season with a few exceptions.

&gt;Plus, I love to watch my club play, and I want them to play as many matches as possible.

Totally agree. I love midweek games.

&gt;I'd also like to take this opportunity to ask about your thoughts on the squad moving forward. I thought Seb and Raj were right on when they noted on their pod yesterday that ""we really didn't learn anything new"" from the match at Wembley. We already knew that we have a strong starting XI with a promising young spine in Kane, Eriksen, Bentaleb, Mason, and Dier, along with a few important veterans like Lloris and Vertonghen. We also knew that Chelsea is better and far more experienced than we are, and they showed this in a very ""professional"" game where they executed their plan quite well and took advantage of a few fortunate bounces.

We didn't learn anything knew. I'd say 11-15 is pretty strong (including Lamela, Stambouli, Fazio and Davies) but thereafter it looks pretty weak. You could include Dembele and Vorm too, I guess. 

&gt;One take-away I have from this match and the season overall to this point is that there aren't too many really glaring holes in our lineup, so much as a broad need for improvement and depth across the board. If we're going to achieve more in the next few years, for example, then guys like Eriksen and Kane will need to continue to develop, elevate their games, and learn consistency. There are certainly many players who can and will continue to improve, including the spine I mentioned, as well as Lamela (who still has a ways to go but has a very high ceiling if he can reach it). If this is the case, though, it makes for an intriguing summer since there don't seem to be massive gaps crying out to be filled.

That depth needs to come from promoting youth players, and 'relegating' existing squad players. I.e. if we sign a central midfielder, it should be to at the very least compete with Mason, if not replace him. Like… we can't just sign a Chadli back-up and expect to progress, for example.

&gt;Some of the things that I'd really like to see is another deeper midfield player to either rotate with Mason, to push Mason to the second XI and so shield him from injury and fatigue, or to allow him to play in more attacking situations. 

Agreed, as above. I'd not be above Mason playing as a 10 in some situations, surprised we've not tried that yet to be honest. Bentaleb/Stambouli/Mason has potential IMO.

&gt;I think we also need another striker, since neither Soldado nor Adebayor appear to be useful options. And, we need someone to solidify a spot as a rotation option for Eriksen. If this is Dembele, I'm alright with that, although I've never been a massive fan of his. One final thing to consider is whether it would be better to go out and find like-for-like alternatives for players, or to deliberately seek players with slightly different skill sets to give us more flexibility in how we come at our opponents.

We need at least one striker – I hope Ings would be one as he's a good fit. 

&gt;So, what do you think? Without putting you on the spot to name specific players, what areas would you like to see addressed? Feel free to answer wherever you'd most prefer, if that's on a later Fighting Cock episode, on your blog, whatever. I know it's a big bundle of questions and might even be premature since the league campaign still has its home stretch.

My priorities would be: striker x2, wing-forward (left-side priority), central midfielder (more creative passer than Stambouli/Bentaleb) to push Mason, and number 10 (although that's lowest priority for me as I think Kane/Mason/Lamela can cover there if necessary).

If alcohol makes you overweight but cannabis makes you more likely to develop throat cancer, which is worse? Skunk has already been shown to have links to mental illness when smoked in high enough quantities which can't be said for alcohol. I think it's dangerous to over-sell cannabis legalisation in this way. It just opens the door for corner cases where it obviously is more harmful.

I think a better way to phrase it would be ""The health risks associated with cannabis are low enough for us to permit its consumption within our society""

Sturridge also scored 20+ goals last season and dragged us through the first few matches when Suarez was unavailable. Sterling was also in better form than Suarez towards the end of last season. We were unfortunate with the extent of his injuries at the start of this season, and made a big mistake signing Balotelli. I'd rather we'd signed a back-up for Sturridge even if that player was Danny Ings or a player with a similar reputation. The way we play, we need strikers that run about and drag defenders with them, not stationary strikers that play with their back to goal. We didn't want Origi to go back on loan, he might have helped us in this situation but it seems we had to loan him back if we wanted him at all. 

&gt; Let's wait for August to see if we build on this situation.

Exactly, I'm hoping for one or two key signings to build on what we've got, and I think that's what FSG will go for. We need a replacement for Gerrard and a quality keeper. As much as Mignolet has improved, he still cannot distribute whatsoever. That said, we're on an incredible run of form ever since the change of system and with the youth in our squad that are only getting better match by match, it wouldn't be the end of the world if we failed to make such signings.

&gt; And this is guaranteed because?

Nothing's guaranteed, but based on what we've seen of these players so far it's definitely leaning that way (at least for Emre Can and Markovic.) If only 1/4 progress the same way as Coutinho, we'll probably make our money back on those that don't.

&gt; Devils advocate here, but it's Van Gaals first season. How about I give you the favorite words of /r/LiverpoolFC[1] ? Transition, settle, bedding, gelling, future etc?

That was my original point. As good as Van Gaal is supposed to be, he's only just 4th place with a United squad featuring the likes of De Gea, RVP, Di Maria, Falcao, Rooney, etc. - I don't doubt that if given enough time, he'll get them back to where they were.

null,false,ex-turpi-causa,eng-GreaterLondon,London Liberal,null,"&gt; many people don't immediately resort to legal action every time someone talks shit about them

That's because there are rules that regulate when a claim may be brought and an entire profession dedicated to advising people on whether they actually have a legitimate claim. Laws are carefully thought out and administered so as to avoid flooding the courts with claimants while at the same time providing access to justice when a set of circumstances arises to warrant it. Those with valid claims are then free to decide whether to pursue recourse through the courts or otherwise. We wouldn't want to take away or unduly limit the availability some of these remedies.  

In legal terms, we largely abandoned the eye for an eye approach to justice by (or thanks to) the Enlightenment. This was also the era where we began to see the philosophical foundations of what are now arguably embodied in Human Rights; natural law thinking gained traction. 

Every single person doesn't behave in such a coordinated manner because not everyone sees the world in that way. Part of what law is there for is to make it as clear as possible what a society has agreed the rules of the game should be, and in exchange, to submit ourselves to the enforcement of those rules by social institutions when we break them.

Obviously this is more complex than merely thinking in terms of the bit of paper the statute was recorded on. A sense of order is what keeps people from that pandemonium, and so far there has been nothing dramatic enough to warrant such chaos.

I just hope we pip them to 4th and the board fires him, setting them back another year.

I dont get this. When it's Rodgers it's OK when we transition and what not. When it's (admittedly the scum) someone else, they're a bad manager? Kek.

&gt; but based on what we've seen of these players so far it's definitely leaning that way

Speculation. Let that be speculation. So your original point about us investing in players that will increase in value is based on speculation. Moot. I can speculate Van Gaal will win the League in the next 2 years. It holds zero credibility.

&gt;The __National Graves Association__ (NGA) ([Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language): ___Cumann Uaigheann na Laochra Gael___) is an [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland) [non-governmental organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization) which seeks to maintain the graves of [Irish republicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_republican) who died in the pursuit of a [united Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Ireland). It is an entirely separate organisation to the [National Graves Association, Belfast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Graves_Association,_Belfast).

&gt;Its stated objectives are ""to restore, where necessary, and maintain fittingly the graves and memorials of our patriot dead of every generation; to commemorate those who died in the cause of Irish Freedom; to compile a record of such graves and memorials"".  Its symbol is the [Red Hand of Ulster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hand_of_Ulster), which is on many graves tended by the association.

While skunk and marijuana in general can produce negative side effects, it is also used to aid individuals with severe medical conditions.[3] Therefore, the debate as to whether or not marijuana should be decriminalized is an ongoing issue found in politics and media in all parts of the world. Currently, cannabis along with other forms of the drug such as skunk weed, are legal through prescription in The Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Ecuador, France, India, Iran, Mexico, North Korea, Pakistan, Switzerland, Spain, Uruguay and 20 various states in the U.S.

This is the kind of thing that people fail on all the time and people even get hurt doing if done wrong. There is no substitute to some bloke (or lady) riding behind you scrutinizing every turn of direction you make. Lessons aren't expensive on two wheels and will brush up your riding a treat. You will be a better rider for it and that's all you can ever aspire to be - a better rider. If you take that attitude, that you want to be the best, safest rider you can be - then you will pass Mod2 with flying colours.

I've been riding for 11 months now, every day, come rain or shine. Never had an accident or a near miss. I ride defensively but I'm quick - I filter and do all of that. I took two days for Mod1 training and two days for Mod2 training. I have that mindset - that I'm safe, controlled and always wanting to be a safer and better rider - but I had bad habits to brush up on which would have failed me for both modules. I had those four days and I passed both modules first time. Would I have passed without the training? No, probably not.

Anyway. My two pence - I'm sure it's possible to do both modules with no formal tuition at all (or very little) but I wouldn't ever advise it to a new rider. 

To answer your question, if you can see cyclists in your mirror or over your shoulder on the left, I would slow down and wait for them to pass safely.

I think it should be mentioned prominently in election material, along side other headline policies.

This can be included in your isa allowance so its tax free, which is what I do. Fees are 1% . I could do this cheaper myself but its all managed for me, I just pay them every month. I like it. 

2. ISA - interest rates are shit but the tax free nature and the govt savings guarantee means i'd keep a safe fund. Moneysavingexpert will have guides to the best new isas soon too. 


3. Peer to peer lending. again MSE have a guide to it. You can get 4-6% (pre-tax) gains from these, including the writeoff from bad debts etc.

In your situation my aim would be for a 55+ retirement income of 1-1.5k/month for 30 years and a paid off house at the same time, plus whatever savings for emergencies etc. If  you need more than 30 years you can sell the house, use those savings etc. 

and of course as soon as that fixed rate ends, either dump a load in from savings as you remortgage to reduce the mortgage down and get an even better rate, or drip-feed overpay to any max limits so its gone asap.

We have amazing players to back us up but they aren't clicking like they used to.  I think moral in the club is really low. I thought Toure would change things with him being that holding mid we needed so desperately once he left but it doesn't quite seem right. Aguero is very poor in form now and he's no  as reliable as he used to be. After the injury that is. 

City as of now under Pellegrini and Mancini have given more importance to its midfield players. A strong and dominant mid is what sets us apart from all the clubs in the Pl. We've played a majority of 4-4-2 all this while. It's brought us the cup last year but it's not really going to lead to the same this year.  We got to win all the games from here on and most importantly need to win the big games for morale. The players really need that. I think a 3-5-2 would be a better way to go. I know Pellegrini has tried to go 4-4-2 with those two wing backs but I think we need more pressure in the mid. We loose the ball to often there. We are offensive by nature, let's step that up.

&gt;The __United Kingdom general election of 2010__ was held on Thursday 6 May 2010, with 45,597,461 registered voters  entitled to vote to elect members to the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom). The [election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_the_United_Kingdom) took place in [650 constituencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_constituencies)  across the United Kingdom under the [first-past-the-post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post) system. None of the parties achieved the 326 seats needed for an overall majority. The [Conservative Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK\)), led by [David Cameron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron), won the largest number of votes and seats but still fell twenty seats short. This resulted in a [hung parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_parliament) where no party was able to command a majority in the House of Commons. This was only the second general election since World War II to return a hung parliament, the first being the [February 1974 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_February_1974). Unlike in 1974, the potential for a hung parliament had this time been widely considered and predicted and both the country and politicians were better prepared for the constitutional process that would follow such a result.  The [coalition government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_coalition_government_(2010%E2%80%93present\)) that was subsequently formed was the first coalition in British history to eventuate directly from an election outcome.

Although there were miners’ strikes in 1972 and 1974 and further action in nationalised industries and in the so-called ‘winter of discontent’ 1978/79, these arose from very real and legitimate wage grievances as unions tried to ensure their members’ pay kept pace with inflation.

Most of the unions’ industrial actions of the period were reactive, either seeking to resist wage or job cuts, or political attacks such as the 1972 Industrial Relations Act. At the time of the Winter of Discontent inflation was at 10% while the government set pay rises at 5% -  5% real terms cut with a backdrop of public service cuts demanded by the IMF in return for its loan in 1976, itself caused by a capitalist fiscal crisis. 

The strikes of the 70s were overblown by the media who had chosen Thatcher as heir apparent and were determined to oust Labout. The strikes had no lasting impact as opposed to the monetary policy about to be utilised by the government.

Basically dig a shallow Chanel where you are going to move your bit, 6-12 inches deep. line this roughly with any kind of plastic sheeting, tarp ect. fill with a layer of post cement which is available form virtually every builders merchant. cover with gravel when dry.

The thing is though, you can get more balanced strains of bud as well. In Colorado they give you the THC and CBD content of the strain on the packet along with whether it is sativa or indica. Also from personal experience hash has completely died out as it was too easily adulterated. During the noughties the supply became saturated with shitty hash that had bits of plastic, oils and other crap in it which rendered it too much of a risk.

Fact of the matter is that Tories don't like welfare up to the point they stop losing votes but they're not going to make that argument clear on their health or welfare manifesto and instead they'll hide behind these words making it really hard for the average punter to actually work out what each party is actually about.  

An example of annoying words:  

&gt; We'll make sure its free at the point of use  

Which mostly means fuck all. Will you block new treatments? Exactly how committed are you to the increasing cost of welfare?  

or how about:  

&gt; We'll invest X Billion  

is X a lot, not much? How much needs to be invested additionally to what is presently invested to keep the level of service or improve it?  

I mean specifically, lets take the Tory's words on the NHS:  

&gt; Fund a strong NHS by delivering a strong economy.

Which actually means something more like:  

&gt; fuck the NHS we're going to implement tax cuts instead.  

or how about Labour on economy:  

&gt;  We will build a strong economic foundation and balance the books......  

followed by:  

&gt; We will increase the National Minimum Wage to £8 an hour..... 

So wait, what? Are you balancing the books or spending more? Make some fucking fuck the fuck sense please!

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting

&gt;A first-past-the-post (abbreviated FPTP or FPP) election is one that is **won by the candidate receiving more votes than any other(s)**. It is a common, but not universal, feature of electoral systems with single-member legislative districts, and generally results over time in a two-party competition.

&gt;The majority criterion states that ""if one candidate is preferred by a majority (more than 50%) of voters, then that candidate must win"".[13] First-past-the-post meets this criterion (**though not the converse: a candidate does not need 50% of the votes in order to win**). Although the criterion is met for each constituency vote, it is not met when adding up the total votes for a winning party in a parliament.",null,0,null,1425474104,null,0,1425474297,0,cp405ys,null,t3_2xw2jc,null,t1_cp405ys,null,t1_cp405d9,null,null,null,1427572927,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

It's as if City's transfer plan is solely based on finding hidden gems but not getting them particularly cheap either. So sometimes it's probably more worthwhile to just pay the big bucks for top class players. Because as many good players that have come in it all too often falls to Aguero, Silva, Yaya and Kompany to pick up the slack.

I buy online, mostly from [Cigar Terminal](http://www.cigarterminal.com/en/) and [Cigars of Cuba](http://www.cigars-of-cuba.com/) but if I want to try some new singles I will buy from a UK website like CGARS. I also buy new world cigars from an American website [Slippery Rock Cigars](https://www.slipperyrockcigars.com/) as they have been good to me over the past couple of years and offer great service. I have had some great boutique brands from there like Leccia, Nomad and 262.

Favourite whisky/whiskey? Wow, that's a tough question. Currently really enjoying some Laphroaig's, I own almost all of the standard releases apart from the 25, which although good I can't quite justify the price in my head. I just got hold of the new 15 year old re-release and look forward to trying it. 

I am really enjoying a bottle of George T. Stagg 2014 I managed to get hold of as well, although technically a bourbon I still put it in the general whiskey category. One of my favourites from last year was Teerenpeli Kaski which is a great sweet, rich and sherried drink. A go to pairing of mine is a Nikka Pure Malt White and a Roman Allones Specially Selected, fantastic match up although I am out of those cigars currently having finished off my last box late last year.

Oh the new Glenmorangie limited edition is worth trying, very tasty and something unique in the whisky scene with the Maris Otter barley.

I've actually been struggling to write something on this for months now, it's good that this comment prompted me to do so.

This shouldn't be seen as the other mods making bad picks: while I'm not as active now at the time new mods were picked I was very active, and also very keen on helping out making stuff for the sub, so while I'm not saying I was the best option (I don't know the others, for example) I think I might have been a decent one.

Where things went south is that I vastly overestimated the amount of time I would be able to dedicate to this, I've been meaning to sit down to put several ideas down to working code for months but there never seems to be a moment in time in my life to do it, and whenever there  *is* time I am simply too tired. :\

I'll bring this up with the mod team: it's probably a good idea to pick somebody else for my spot, as I am not contributing enough and it's something that is always on the back of my mind, making me feel crappy, I believe in transparency though, so I wanted to give a public explanation on this for the benefit of the community.

Let me take you back to the pre Victorian eras. Areas like Bermondsey and Deptford, where I grew up, were actually quite wealthy upper working to middle class areas. We're talking two of the biggest and best known London docking areas at a period when the Empire was built on our shipping industry.

Fast forward a few decades and that's all coming to an end. The industrial revolution is long gone, and now we're about to enter a period of near constant war abroad and in Europe. Bermondsey and Deptford become some of the most populated areas in England and chock full of slums. We all know the East end was bad, but take a look back at the state of South East London. People forget that at that time the surrounding areas stretching from Lewisham into Bromley and the rest of Kent simply were not built up at that time. Vast areas around Peckham were still farm land!

After the second world war we have men returning to nothing, Immigrants like my parents coming over, invited, to work in the mean time, and bombed out and inadequate housing stock.

So what do our leaders do? With [Charles Booths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Booth_%28philanthropist%29) social survey in hand, they go about clearing the slums of London, an endeavour that had started decades before and took decades still. 

It's all about timing I'm afraid.

By the time we get to Southwark and Lewisham we have reached a point in British architectural history where we've figured out a way to use less land while housing more people. Tower blocks. In conjunction with massive multi-story housing estates with overhead walkways and a few towers dotted about in between, the councils in South London changed the face of those boroughs forever. These flats were initially for the white working class of these areas and at first they were extremely well met. Modern, clean, technologically advanced for the time, they were a hit at first. Then something dawned on the residents. Having a chat with your neighbour while you sweep your doorstep, sharing a cup of tea while you gossip over the back garden fence, hanging your washing out in your garden, calling the kids in from the street right in front of you for tea...none of this was possible 20 floors up in a council flat.

The walkways were dark and unsafe. You couldn't pop round to the neighbours...you had to go several floors down, over a walkway, up some more flights of steps. No one liked this. It destroyed the traditional white working class way of life.

So in the late 60's to the 70's they all started leaving. Depford, New Cross, Bermondsey...they all start heading to Mottingham, Penge, Grove Park, Petts Wood, Orpington. They start seeking out areas being built with the sort of terrace housing they're used to. My parents bought one of these former council houses in Downham. Built in the 30's. These areas are have communities in them that are less than 100 years old. Nothing like the hundreds years old communities they left.

Lewisham and Southwark were left in a pickle. A bunch of new flats that *no one* wanted. They did what was natural, they went down the housing list until people said yes. Those people happened to be West Indian and African immigrants taking advantage of their freedom of movement afforded to those from former colonies. The fact they didn't have to contend with a language barrier made it an attractive move. Again, all in the timing.

So, that is what kicked off the white flight of SE London. Not the mere presence of brown faces. You actually make white working class Londoners out to be more racist that they actually are, which I find hilarious.",null,0,null,1425476119,null,0,false,0,cp40u64,null,t3_2xrvio,null,t1_cp40u64,null,t1_cp2xtfh,null,null,null,1427573241,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

This won't be a problem. You're an EU national, so you have a right to work here, and your English is clearly excellent, so don't worry about it.

&gt;Do I have a chance to find a job in the UK while I'm abroad?

This is a little bit more of a problem - but only a little bit.

It's absolutely possible to find a job in the UK while you're abroad - in fact I personally know two people who've done exactly that this year. There are a few companies that shy away from hiring people who are looking to relocate though - this includes if they are relocating from within the company.

I've been to interviews for such jobs and they've told me they're concerned about hiring someone and training them if it turns out that they don't settle in the new area and want to return to wherever they came from or a different part of the country.

It's something I've only heard a couple of times though, and it's certainly not the norm. If you already have a job in Poland then definitely keep that and start looking on the side - it's only a couple of hours to get over here if you need to come for an interview. In fact, one of the people I know did his interview via Skype and had never even been to the UK until 2 days before he started work (and it's definitely a very good job).

&gt;In a situation of no overall control the Government in power before the General Election gets the first chance at creating a government. If they cannot do so, the Prime Minister will resign.

People have abysmally short memories about the property market, and having your entire retirement income relying on a single asset class is dangerous.

In addition to that, managing 10 properties will not feel like retirement, even if you employ a letting agent (and give away 15% of your gross rent). It requires time and effort in a way other investments tend not to.

That's not to say that BTL can't be lucrative, but you need to keep your wits about you and be aware of the potential pitfalls (which people gladly gloss over when thinking it through).

As I mentioned, the main attraction of property is the gearing. If you didn't pay the mortgages off, you would be receiving income and capital growth from a £200k asset, with only £50k of your own money invested. This means the effective return typically looks like 10-15% on a good year, rather than 4-5% for a non-geared BTL. Of course, the losses will be magnified too.

Regular pension savings, on the other hand, should provide a ""real"" return of ~ 3% PA. £3k per month and a £50k start might produce a ""real"" value of ~ £1M by 55, which could be withdrawn at a ""safe withdrawal rate"" of 3.5% - 4%.

You've got your sums wrong with the property. There's no way that your plan would result in assets of £2M.

You can say one of his failings so far has been his deference to Gerrard when trying to figure out how to best organize the team, and his stubbornness to keep him in the team even when he wasn't performing well within our system. Really if we're honest, Gerrard being out recently has been a blessing in disguise as we've been able to insert much more flexible players into the system.

Moving forward every player will have to play and fit into his system/style of play or his name won't be on the team sheet.  This is where having a really young team is an advantage as younger players have a much greater capacity to adapt and improve their game to maximize the qualities that BR desires (Sterling is a great example).  And Rodgers has an excellent system now that I believe will make it perhaps easier for us to continue to attract and develop young talent that are looking for a chance to prove themselves.

Also the Overclockers site is far better laid out, Scan is rubbish for finding things and the category and filter system they use always ends up returning things I'm not looking for.

Not sure what they would even be using a USB stick for with an incomplete bundle? Maybe you should look what's on there and report back? The only thing I can think of is it could be something that they use for testing the hardware and the customer story is just BS?

You might also see words like ‘pledge’ or claims they’ll ‘work towards’ doing something. 

Approach EVERYTHING said with cynicism. Some parties will have certain goals and may make good on things that seem (to you) like a good idea. But everything is subject to change and they’re not really held accountable for what they say they’ll do or not do – that goes for any party. 

Keep an open mind – but you’ll find many of us here are quite pessimistic about anything that politicians say and the reason for that is seeing so much evidence of them being a self-serving group of people, regardless of political party affiliation.

Personally, I have done the same as you are planning, although I bought at a lower price point; this is location dependant though.

The echo the previous comment, there are a lot more costs than what you see on the TV shows. However, a good accountant, mortgage broker and solicitor will help you and guide you once you have defined your strategy, plus you can offset their fees against your tax bill.

The three key rules you should bear in mind are:
1. Buy at the best possible price - you make your money in property when you buy
2. Buy in areas with strong rental demand
3. Buy for cash flow - this is an investment. Buying for possible capital growth is speculation, and is risky especially if interest rates rise. (If it generates positive cash flow, and the value also goes up then that is just gravy!)

Style of play with Bobby, more conservative in defence but had the advantage with better personnel for that job. Lescott/Kompany and especially in cdm department with Barry/De Jong to partner Yaya, the odd time playing all three.

Style of play with Pelle as we know is more attacking and in defence is about playing a high line but he has the disadvantage ofworse personnel for the defensive job. Mangala/Demi with Komps (though I disagree with others that Demi dives in to challenges regularly compared to others, but still far from the level of Lescott in 11/12) and Pelles also hindered by having the two Ferns to partner Yaya for cdm duties.

* Reliance on any particular players

I think in 11/12 we still relied on important players like we do today like Kompany, Silva, Yaya, Aguero but you could argue that all round form was better among all ranks.

In 13/14, well I think it was the same spine that we relied on but one name stands out above all else of course and that's Yaya Toure.

* Tactics and formations used (one or many, what kinds)

Tactics as I mentioned Mancini was more conservative and we attacked through the middle a lot more, where as Pellegrini is more direct and wants to be pressuring defenders with constant fast attacking.

* Expectations that season 

Both seasons we had high expectations as we spent the majority of 11/12 top of the table IIRC and had a worrying end when a lot thought we'd blown it when Utd overtook us.

13/14 was similar in that we were always flirting with top of the table (2 games in hand for a good bit) but expectations about us in general were a lot higher by then obviously, again we had a scare near the end.

* How they compared to title rivals that season

We were pretty much on a par with United in 11/12 and thanks to Pools wonder season last year I would say the same about them.

 Mental disorders are merely categorized combinations of symptoms (which are merely over- or underdeveloped traits of our personality, which is affected by the usage and size of different parts of the brain and experiences we make). We call them disorders or diseases because they differ from the big 'norm' (which is probably the state in which you are most likely to be able to live in our society content, happily and without any big problems - makes you wonder if that is even the *natural norm*). 
In this sense, nobody is really healthy, neither physically nor mentally because we are way to complex and individual.


We have already analyzed brains from serial killers and in some cases have found that specific parts of their brains were in size either over- or under-average which resulted in aggressiveness and a lack of accountability. So you can in some sense call them mentally ill and question their responsibility. Society would still not forgive them. After what they do or did, they have lost their right to live freely in this society.

Just a few points on this study you've linked: 

&gt;the study is not able to prove that the patterns of cannabis use directly caused psychosis – it can only show associations

&gt;the researchers did not have information on the amount of cannabis usage in terms of joints or grams, and this may influence the associations seen

&gt;the researchers did not directly compare high- versus low-potency cannabis to see if the difference in risk between them was statistically significant.

It seems to me that this study only shows a correlation between high potency cannabis and psychosis. The media has misrepresented it in saying that cannabis causes psychosis in 24% of cases, which is grossly inaccurate.

I think Balotelli could, and should, still be at Liverpool next season. Given Rodger's predilection for young, talented players...I can't see why he wants to throw him away. This is what confuses me about the way that Rodgers seems to have treated him

Coach him. Mould him. I think people tend to forget he is still 24 years old. Sturridge, who most people would say came of age last year, was 24 when this happened.

I think there are two parts to his general play at the moment and this season. 1) His confidence is shot. SHOT. That's why his finishing has been so poor, because he hasn't been relying on instinct. 2) I actually believe that he has to be more selfish. Asking him to press is the correct way to go, but tell him to never venture further back than 10 yards from the defense he's playing against. IT IS USELESS FOR HIM TO BE HELPING OUT OUR MIDFIELD. If he makes sure that he in that 10 yard area, he has the pace and athleticism to chase balls down and harry the defense also making use of his physical strength if the ball is played to feet, while also making sure he's available for the ball played over the top to run onto.

Keep him, with Sturridge and Origi, and maybe another top class young forward (Alexandre Lacazette is top of my list) and you have serious ability.

It naturally creates some great passing diamonds - Vertonghen or Dier can step into midfield to contribute to the build up on their side, while the other two slide over to cover. Walker and rose are able to stretch play higher up the pitch, providing that width that we just don't have (while maintaining a 4 man midfield!), and in turn opening up the channels for runs in behind. Eriksen and Lamela can take up the positions they want to - in the halfspaces instead of on the wings - and if you put someone in to shut down the DM space (Zouma) he can't cover both of them at the same time.

It can lead to problems and it does wreck lives even if you aren't even the user, (I've had all my stuff smashed to pieces and a long-term relationship wrecked by my-then boyfriend who became increasingly paranoid and erratic on cannabis, one family member was unlucky enough to step on a junky's discarded needle while clearing up rubbish in the bushes outside his work place and had to go through all sorts of tests for the next few months, I know plenty of people who have had money stolen off friends and relatives for drugs, etc.) If it is decriminalized or legalized I think we should proceed with caution and people accurately educated on the actual downsides of doing them (bullshit are they all sunshine and roses, and that includes weed).  

As a sidenote, I see a lot of people in this thread talk about how if drugs are legalized that they can now go mental on mdma and smoke as much weed as they want. This is an attitude that really turns the rest of the public off drug legalization. If you're doing it discreetly, responsibly and not causing any problems people are more likely to be accepting, as soon as you start waving drugs in other people's faces, talking about how you're going to get shitfaced or what have you, and even defending driving while stoned, then people are going to start seeing drug users as a nuisance/danger. Most people who are against drugs aren't against them because they're sheep following what the government tells them to think, or they've somehow been duped by propaganda that you the drug user has been ever so smart to see through, people have often had their lives affected in negative ways by drugs and drug users. If you want them legalised, you'll have to somehow show people how these drugs will have little to no impact on society instead of going on about how stupid and uninformed they must be.

Could you find a person in this entire country that says cannabis is harmless? Everything that you ingest causes you harm to some degree or another. What a complete strawman, honestly.

&gt;  There is a lot of evidence showing that smoking weed led to people getting panic attacks at earlier ages.

The same is true of any drug. Again, this is not being disputed and is why age restrictions are put on tobacco alcohol and will also be applied to cannabis.

&gt; If you are predisposed to mental illnesses it was likely to trigger them

Yes, those that are predisposed to mental illnesses that smoke *skunk like weed* (i.e. large quantities of THC) are more likely to become psychotic.

Applicable to tobacco as well.

&gt; Obviously I don't have access to get behind the paywalls for the journals anymore but I just don't get why everyone thinks cannabis is so harmless.

Again no one thinks its harmless. You are creating a strawman for yourself to argue against if you really think that is the case.

What people are arguing against is the fact that Tobacco and Alcohol are both legal and will continue to be for the foreseeable future and yet a drug which is less harmful comparatively is illegal.

Whats more is that the policy of cannabis criminalisation makes no sense from a cultural (british empire was very heavily involved in hemp trade) societal (alcohol induced aggression vs cannabis induced... day dreaming) economic (£300m a year spent on punishments, legalisation potentially £900m industry) or medical viewpoint.

null,false,houseaddict,null,null,null,"I have had trouble with them as it goes and it left me really pissed off and I have not ordered anything since. It's a real shame as I had the free delivery from the hexus forums and had been a customer of theirs for probably 10 years.

So here is what happened, I bought myself a lovely R290 graphics card, it was an XFX one. Basically, it never worked right, I had problems with it straight away, when I finally got it to work (after re installing OS and replacing my power supply and shit loads of other work). I decided the card must be the problem, everything was fine with my older 6950 card but the R290 wouldn't even play a game without crashing and the frame rates were awful. So I RMA'd it, they tested it, said it was fine and sent it back. Cue more furious working from me until I tried it in my housemates PC with the exact same result. I am now a million percent sure it's the card, they wouldn't accept it was broken. They wouldn't give me a refund, in the end I had to settle for giving them a £10% restocking fee to get some of my money back. On top of that I had to cover postage costs.

So, I still need a graphics card and decide to order an Asus one of Amazon, it arrives and works perfectly however I can hear one of the fans making a sound because it's catching on the edge of the cooler. No way I can put up with it, it's a £300 card for fucks sake. So I prepare myself for another ardous RMA process this time with amazon.

Not a bit of it.

Filled in a form online, allowed me to order another card and gave me a MONTH to send the faulty one back. I went with the XFX one again and finally got a perfect one. So there you have it, if you want to buy computer components, go with amazon. On top of all that, it's nearly always cheaper.

It's downright obvious Nick has absolutely zero intention on enacting this policy. He knows it. I know it. I hope you know it. And given the current state of this country, with the number of issues it has. Decriminalisation of pot should not be a vote decider. 

We don't live in the US where thousands of people are imprisoned for drugs possession. There are 10k people in jail for drug offences. The vast majority of these are for dealing (decriminalisation possession does not change this)

 My point was that to say ""is it less harmful than drinking? Yes - is beyond question"" is just asking for trouble. If there is a correlation between smoking a form of cannabis and mental illness which the question of whether it is a causal relationship remains unanswered then you can't go around saying ""beyond question"". It's just bad science.

What quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption is comparable to what quantity and frequency of cannabis consumption? Then, for what health metrics?

It causes offence. The majority of people in Mid-Ulster vote nationalist, so obviously they consider themselves more Irish than British. Why pay tribute to a foreign army that has committed multiple massacres on your people? Better ban them, along with other items that tribute your own war dead so as to minimise offence.

No, it's not. It *includes* the Easter Rising, but a lot of people, perhaps the majority, see it as commemorating every dead combatant in the wars with Britain.

&gt; Okay. Did you know that around 95% of dead British servicemen died after 1914? So not imperialist causes rather fighting to defend innocent people, mainly in Europe.

1914-18 was a bureaucratic, imperialist shit storm of a war. They did not die for a noble reason whatsoever, teenage boys sent to their death by old men for reasons that have no benefit to them whatsoever. Why commemorate that war, when you can protest how fucking stupid it was.

Ireland was neutral (however much it secretly helped allies) in WW2. The mighty British Army put the north in jeopardy by clinging on to it, if anything.

At 20 years old you have the powerful device of time that means that £50 you put in today could be worth £500 by the time you are looking to retire. 

The workplace pension is by far the best option because you get free money from your employer that would otherwise disappear. You will get tax relief on a pension so the idea is roughly you pay 4%, employer 3% and an extra 1% will be added on by the gov as tax relief - so at your salary £80 + £40 + £20 = £140 per month (from a cost to you of £80) - that is a great deal for you. 

If you made these contributions in a typical pension until you were 65, and increased the contribution by 3% each year you would end up with a pension pot of possibly £400K, from your contributions of £80K.

As for basic savings - yes shuffle the money around to get the best deal, and going into an ISA is a reasonable way to never have to pay interest on it.

null,false,ibpants,1972crest,,null,"My two penneth: 

* Style of play (broadly but also anything noteworthy)

More similar than people like to imagine.  Mancini has been characterised as a defensive manager, but we definitely an attacking force in the 11/12 campaign too. The big differences for me:

|11/12|13/14|
|:--:|:--:|
|More discipline in the CB pairing|More boldness from the CBs|
|More emphasis on patient build up play|More willingness to counter rapidly|
|Greater protection for the defence from midfield| More support for the attack from midfield|
|Deeper defensive line|Higher defensive line

* Reliance on any particular players

Same in both seasons broadly.  Hart and Kompany were both crticised more in 13/14, but both played a key part.  Toure and Silva were crucial both seasons.  Aguero and Dzeko both performed when it counted.

Nasri was much more vital in the 13/14 season.

* Tactics and formations used (one or many, what kinds)

In both it was a fluid 4-2-2-2 with very attacking fullbacks.  Used differently, but the broad shape and personnel were very similar.

* Expectations that season

In 11/12 I'm not sure we really dreamed that we'd win it that year (I know I didn't), but the first game (4-0 against Swansea with Aguero's debut) felt special - like big things were going to happen soon.  I think top-4 was assumed, top-2 felt doable but optimistic.

In 13/14 we were a bit more confident in ourselves but it was a season of big changes (Moyes, Mourinho, Pellegrini) and I think it was tough to predict.  That said I think most saw it as a 2 horse race between us and Chelsea.

* How they compared to title rivals that season

In 11/12 we were up against a late-Fergie era United team that specialised in winning the ugly matches (to give them credit, they got the goals and plenty of them, but seldom looked dominant in doing so), while were showing flair and fluidity that we hadn't previously shown in many people's lifetimes, but after Christmas found that we struggled in the ugly games after teams realised that packing the defense would leave us passing aimlessly around the final third (the return of Tevez and brief emergence of Nasri made a difference in the latter stages, plus Pizarro's creativity from deep was a helpful plan B).

In 13/14 our title rival ended up being much more similar to us.  The Liverpool team of that year were very much like us - balls to the wall in attack and a total suicide show in defence.  The key difference from where I'm sitting seemed to be that Rogers got his team fired up for the latter stages and perhaps caused a few too many nerves leading to a handful of big errors.  Over in Manchester, Pellegrini was busy being boring as fuck and making it difficult for anyone to get themselves too worked up and it proved to be beneficial since we won those latter games in a steady and calm fashion that was the polar opposite of how we finished out the 11/12 campaign

Differences between the 2 seasons

I feel like naturally covered a lot of this, so I'll use this to summarise.  11/12 was a more conservative playing style but a hugely dramatic season (the Tevez saga, ""why always me?"", the collapse and subsequent last ditch redemption).  13/14 was a more dramatic playing style but was a very low-key season (to abridge Rudyard Kipling's *If*: If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs [...] yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it.)",null,0,null,1425486453,null,0,false,0,cp4602v,null,t3_2xw3g9,null,t1_cp4602v,null,t3_2xw3g9,null,null,null,1427575722,null,8,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,8,null

seriously, and to be quite honest, when you look at his stats on how often he completes those hollywood passes, most of those people would be completely shocked. to be honest, the way i see it and it should be seen, is that what gerrard makes one of those passes, it's in order to switch the flow of play, or switch the field. the passes he makes are of such a distance that if we lose the ball, it's of no real consequence to directly lead to a scoring chance for the opponent and when they come off (which is pretty high to be honest) he usually creates a chance either directly, or indirectly because he has switched the entire flow of the game. stevie knows when and where to pick that pass and play it and i would venture to say that 5/10 times he hits the man straight on his foot and an additional 3/10 play our man into space...such a cop out answer to describe gerrard's shortcomings and truly one of his greatest strengths. 

think of it this way (and duney i know your with me on this) each squad has players that need to play tidy and safe and keep things ticking and every team needs risk takers. the difference between good and great teams is when they find that right balance. chelsea, they have mikel, matic, terry, even willian who are very safe, and hazard, oscar, cuadrado, etc who are risky. liverpool has allen, hendo, skrtel, who are very safe, gerrard, coutinho, sturridge, those are some of our risk takers. if every one of our passes was 5 yards, how would we ever penetrate defenses? 1-2's don't always work, that's why someone with stevie's abilities is so rare and valued...not many can drive a pass into someones chest that is 70 meters away...it just does not happen that often. anyways, i think in the current form our team is in, stevie doesn't walk straight into the starting XI, but i do think BR will try to integrate him and i don't have gripes about that. stevie obviously because he's injured isn't one of our top 11 players in terms of form, but he is 100%, undeniably still one of our best 11 players and BR will find a way to fit him in. There is arguably no better time for stevie to come back into the squad, the squad is moving, making runs, scoring, interchanging and all of that jazz very well, and who better to pick out those runs from danny boy, from razza, from coutinho, from lallana, from hendo than stevie. i mean it's truly a no brainer that stevie would have no problems fitting in. and this whole notion that stevie can't press or has no legs is bollocks too. look early on and even against spurs when stevie has played just 1 match a week...he was great. although he was injured since that tottenham game, he has effectively been using the last month to up his conditioning, to work on his fitness and his health. he is going to be ready to go 90 minutes a game for the next 10 games (assuming he doesn't play against burnley) and he will not bring the level down one bit, he will elevate it. that is the truth, mark my words. anyone who disagrees, please feel free to downvote, but at least give me the decency of a response as to why you disagree.

I'm actually trying to say the opposite of that. LVG, a world-renowned manager, has struggled as much as Rodgers has (when you put both their first seasons into perspective.) All the people calling for a world class manager, well there he is, and even he needs time to get the players performing to the best of their abilities.

&gt; Kek.

Is that really necessary?

&gt; Speculation. Let that be speculation. So your original point about us investing in players that will increase in value is based on speculation. Moot. I can speculate Van Gaal will win the League in the next 2 years. It holds zero credibility.

Better sack every pundit and scout in the world then and not even bother talking about football, if speculation and subjective opinions aren't welcome in football we could save some money and get Fallows and his crew off the books.

Young players don't get this kind of game-time unless they're going somewhere. Look back two years ago. Sterling was seen as a pace machine and nothing more, but over time he's developed into a very technically gifted player who has the positional awareness to play anywhere across the front line. Coutinho had a good pass on him but disappeared in many games, he's vastly improved on his ability to shake off his marker and get into areas where he can do damage, all while adding some beautiful goals to his game.

Not all young players live up to expectations, but even if only half of them do, we'll have the foundation of a very good team. It's not like these ""youngsters"" are 17-18 year olds playing first team football for the first time. Markovic, Moreno and Can were already established players in their respective leagues before they joined us.

&gt; Yeah. But it will be the end of title aspirations. Quote me on that and frame it.

I'm inclined to agree, but tell that to the form table. It all depends on how well we start, how other teams react to us, how our young players continue to develop, and how lucky we are with injuries. I wouldn't say it's impossible, but I wouldn't think it would be likely given the fact that Chelsea, City, United, and maybe Arsenal will all continue to spend.",null,0,null,1425486935,null,0,false,0,cp46aoh,null,t3_2xry19,null,t1_cp46aoh,null,t1_cp3ykhe,null,null,null,1427575859,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

I'm not so sure. The boy who committed the stabbing is described as being of slim build whereas the other two were bigger. It was a busy road and it most snatch/grab and dash crimes speed is what helps them to get away. I wouldn't be surprised if he just didn't feel confident in his ability to push someone off their bike by force and figured he'd use the knife to speed up the process.

I worked with a lot of teenagers who carried knives. Their reasoning was that it was safer than a gun, still intimidating but less fatal! Many of them didn't ever think that they'd use it or if they did they would just aim for somewhere ""safe"" like the leg. No concept of how easy it is to kill someone with a knife and that there is no safe place to aim. Then there is the complete absence of thought when it comes to consequence.

I could of course be totally wrong and he could well have left home with murderous intent that day. We'll not know until more details surface. I'm just saying that to me it's likely that he realised they needed to get the boys of their bikes quickly and thought the best way for him to do it was stab him and then take the bike.

I'm one of those who'd also love to see Jovetic at the club, as I think he'd be another very very useful attacking creative option. He's proven to be fairly prolific in both goals and assists, and I genuinely think he's the type to thrive and blossom in an environment where he is loved. If he gets close to recreating the form he showed in Italy, and more importantly scoring the goals, then where better a place to be valued and shown support and love by the fans than at Anfield.

One thing I would add (and I'm sure it's been mentioned) is the central midfield role. I think the squad you named would be in trouble if we had an injury to 1/2 of the CM's mentioned. Imagine a lengthy injury to Hendo? 

Pjanic would be my first choice for sure. Hard worker, brilliant playmaker and a real touch of class. I also like to think that Nainggolan at Roma is bezzie mates with Origi &amp; Migs, because he's a hell of a player with great energy. One or the other is realistic though, but I hope one of them fancies a change from chasing the Serie A title this summer.

The Spanish connection of Illaramendi that's been floating around (let's hope Xabi puts in a word) is pretty exciting too. Not seen much of him myself, but people seem to think he's a young player with a big future, and he'd most likely flourish in our side if given a chance to compete for the starting position alongside Hendo.

I also think Milner would be a huge signing for us. Premier League proven, similar energy, work-rate and desire as Hendo, and ridiculously versatile.

You're right though - priorities are most certainly a GK to give Migs the competition, and a re-jig of the current defence to provide a balance for the players that are most likely on their way out, back-up for fatigue/injury and it's also a chance to get a few more lads in that are capable of playing the new system.

I think its pretty understandable to be offended at government buildings selling items which commemorate people responsible for murdering your family in cold blood, but I guess I just have a warped sense of ^right ^^and ^^^wrong...

&gt; No it's just the Rising, if it means more to you that's grand but that's not what it's meant for. Also would you support banning the sale of it everywhere there's a Unionist majority?

No. It's more than the Rising. I come from a staunchly nationalist family, I have more than one SF councillor friend. It represents all Irish independence combatants who died. Wikipedia it if you want, look at practically any non-yankee source.

Yes, ban the sale of it everywhere there is a unionist majority if you want, as long as your banning the sale of the poppy alongside it. As is what is happening in Mid-Ulster. 

&gt; What about the Tricolour should we ban that too?

Tricolour =/= Easter Lily. They are not connected, and symbolize massively different things. Banning a flag is stupid, no matter what flag it is.

&gt; but it contributed more to the end of the Empire era of history and Irish independence than the Easter Rising did.

Ireland hasn't achieved full independence, your point is void. Britain still holds colonies all over the world. What has ceased since then is simply land-grabbing for the sake of land-grabbing, nothing more.

&gt; I know right? Man I wish the Nazis were running the place.

Oh yeah, forgot the republic was under Nazi rule, how stupid of me. /s.

&gt; You're kidding right? the Russians were arguably just, just below the worst of the Nazis and killed almost as many of their own soldiers.

Their own soldiers killed more Nazis than the rest of the allies combined. Around 78% of the Nazi army, which is around 11,700,000 Nazis. The deaths in the Red Army are estimated at being between 8,700,000 and 13,850,000. 

One might say the Red Army pretty much single handedly destroyed the Nazis, at a very high cost to themselves. They fought the bloodiest battles, gained the most strategic ground, and crippled their opponents all over the place.

&gt; killed almost as many of their own soldiers.

Every ally practised the death penalty for deserters, I'm afraid to tell you. You know, in your precious WW1 there were a load of Irish killed by the British for deserting?

The great thing about the BBC is that by nature of the fact that everyone who watches TV needs a license, it has to make TV for everyone. So it means shows like the Voice exist, but then so do random science documentaries with obscure university professors on BBC4 at 11pm on a Tuesday. There are so many shows on the BBC that simply wouldn't exist on commercial services, and those shows are some of the best it produces.

Then there's the fact that even when it produces something amazing like Planet Earth, the 3rd party commercialisation is almost non-existent. No tie-ins with GoPro (""Planet Earth with GoPro"") or anything, it's refreshing.

The current loophole is a load of shit though. If I just watch BBC 15 mins behind schedule online I never have to pay because it's ""catch up""? I think a lot of people are pissed this loophole is going because they loved it... well, tough shit!

The bit I'm torn on is their solution. Why not go for an account type approach instead, where you have to login to use the online services? Probably would still be open to manipulation, but better than current situation. Or why not open the BBC subscription up to the world, and rake in the billions it inevitably would from all its foreign fans?

Somebody should be in his ear and be telling him that he needs to keep a tighter line with his centre half pairing and not jump into challenges where a defensive mid should be. A knock on from that is whoever is playing that role to be more disciplined. Vinnie will not feel the need to jump out as regularly.  Akin to when we had De Jong. 

We essentially need to play as 2 teams, a bank of 5 when defending with a disciplined CDM and a bank of 5 attackers with additional midfielder in this bank dropping into the defensive duties quicker than they have been doing. 

Samir and Silva just need to be infront of the two Full Backs as soon as they can be when we are defending. Yes we are going to get caught, its the way we play. But for all this philosophy, sometimes you need to play the game and the team and not worry about being attacking and attractive.

None that don't want to be part of it. That all changed thanks to WW1.

You can say that but you'd be wrong. The Nazi's lost because of pressure on both fronts, had they focused on one they would have won. Or invaded at a better time and been more prepared for winter.

When it comes to drugs comparing one to another is very difficult. It always comes down to quantity, frequency, and what health metrics you're talking about. I suspect most ""kills"" from alcohol come from heavy drinkers. If this can be said to be true, how do moderate alcohol drinkers compare to moderate weed smokers? This is probably more important as it'll cover the majority of users. 

Statistics is a harsh mistress but you have to abide by her rules if you want to go around stating ""X is better than Y and that's a fact"".

OK - you need to measure the hole and take the picture to a double glazing company and see if they can get you something with the same pattern.  

If you look closely at the edge of the window (normally on the inside) you will see a tiny thin gap between the bead (45deg bit) and the frame.  Generally this looks like its part of the window as its a very snug fit.  Stick a knife or paint scraper into the crack in the middle of the bead and tap with a mallet toward the hole where the glass was and the bead will pop out as the plastic bends.  Start with the longest sides first.  Google ""replacing UPVC window instructions"" and there are loads of vids on youtube on how to do this. Its not a hard job.

All that mush out of the way though, two quick questions:

1) How are you guys finding Kyle Naughton? He wasn't very popular at Spurs, in part due to poor performances, but some of it was unfair as (especially under AVB) he was constantly used as a make-shift left-back, how has he been since coming over?

2) What was the overall feeling when we signed Michel Vorm in the summer? He seems a competent shot stopper, but is rooted to his line and doesn't command his area. Maybe we are spoiled watching Hugo Lloris week in and week out. Vorm made an especially high profile mistake against Leicester that knocked us out of the FA Cup and lost him a lot of favor with sections of our support, is he error prone?

The pledge was never reliant on the Lib Dems being a majority government, I have no idea if you're deliberately misleading people with that claim or just confused.

To keep the pledge all they had to do was vote against a rise in tuition fees, but they didn't, 28 Lib Dem MPs including Clegg, voted **for** a rise.

Promised to vote against a rise, voted for a rise. 

Whether they expected to be in government or minority opposition is and always has been totally irrelevant. They pledged to do something and they did the exact opposite.

&gt;  I think the issue is with how the poppy is viewed in this country and i'll not get into who's to blame but the idea that a mark of respect is an expression of your political ideals is pathetic. On both sides.

I agree, but that's the reality in which we live in. It has been politicised. Maybe that can slowly go away in the future.

&gt; Britain is by no means the only country that uses the poppy as a sign of respect and the idea that Catholics or Southerners are separate is ridiculous particularly when the main war it represents and the day it is worn on symbolises came prior to partition and involved Irish people as a whole.

There's a few things to consider here.
#
* Is there any country outside of the Commonwealth that uses the poppy as a sign of respect?
* People use it also to remember a great number of wars, not just WWI including modern wars like Iraq which people have very mixed feelings on.
* I agree to some extent. The Republic has mixed feelings about WWI -- we ignored irish participation in it for a long time, but now are discussing it a lot more since the GFA.

There was a request to delay the kick-off, to reduce the urgency of fans wanting to get into the ground, but that was denied, and instead they took the most unsafe and least controllable option by opening up the Exit Gates and using them as entry gates.

It's not retarded at all, because it is simply a fact. You can try to insult me if you want, but I am drawing my information from the World Health Organisation - so apparently, they are retarded too.

&gt;Would you broadly go around saying that alcohol is safer than tobacco?

Yes I would. Tobacco kills twice as many people - 8.8% of deaths worldwide caused by tobacco, 3.2 by alcohol, 0.4 all other illicit drugs. But if you are wanting to look at it in your terms, then in terms of average years lost to usage they are similar. All other illicit drugs combined have less than a quarter of the impact, so my original claim is still true on that metric.

http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/facts/global_burden/en/

&gt;Statistics is a harsh mistress but you have to abide by her rules if you want to go around stating ""X is better than Y and that's a fact"".

Yes, using statistics requires that you draw your conclusions from facts with evidence to back them up, as I have done.

&gt;As you said, the cannabis argument is only true in very broad terms. 

No, it's true in very narrow terms as well. No recorded death ever from any form of cannabis overdose, numerous reported deaths worldwide every week from alcohol overdose - with victims ranging from long term users, to short term binge drinkers, to first time drinkers. It is vastly more dangerous.

null,false,EireOfTheNorth,null,null,null,"&gt; Well done you have repeatedly ignored the point of the poppy. You were wondering why I called you a moron?

How am I? Here's what it says on the Royal British Legions website about the poppy, I've highlighted a few things.

&gt; The Legion created the Poppy Appeal to help those returning from the First World War. A century on from the start of that conflict, ***we're still helping today's Armed Forces families in much the same way, whether coping with bereavement, living with disability, or finding employment.***

&gt;The poppy is a powerful symbol. ***It is worn to commemorate the sacrifices of our Armed Forces and to show support to those still serving today and their loved ones.***

&gt;***Money raised through the Poppy Appeal goes directly to our welfare work providing through life care to anyone who is currently serving in the British Armed Forces, who has previously served, and their families.***

&gt;When you donate to the Poppy Appeal you help:

&gt;bereaved families to Live On
wounded Service men and women to Live On
younger veterans seeking employment and housing to Live On
older veterans needing age-related care to Live On
 
&gt;Our vital welfare work is entirely dependent on the public's generous support – so please give generously and wear your poppy with pride, knowing that ***you are helping the Armed Forces community to Live On.***

Okay. The poppy came about after WWI - That's probably were your confusion is stemmed from. However, do you think that over 100 years after WWI began, it is still being used to commemorate one war, to help veterans of one war? No. As I've highlighted **""It is worn to commemorate the sacrifices of our Armed Forces and to show support to those still serving today and their loved ones.""** - So I ask you again, do you see how commemorating or showing support, or seeing people support the murderers of my family, can be offensive? I can't make it any simpler for you.

&gt; I did. It says exactly what I've been saying. It commemorates the Easter Rising specifically, some people use it for some other things, those people are a minority.

Sources please. It came out of the Easter Rising, like the Poppy did with WWI, but it commemorates them all, like the Poppy.

&gt; Really? I wonder if the people in the Republic feel the same way. Oh wait they don't. Nor do the vast majority of people in this country who want to be part of the Union atm.

You and I see Ireland differently. I see it as the full island - survey the full island on if they would like to see independence, you'll get a yes. Survey the gerrymandered state and it's quite obvious you're get a gerrymandered answer.

&gt; None that don't want to be part of it. That all changed thanks to WW1.

Yeah, because most of the ones that remain only remain because of plantation-type invasions. The Falklands, for example. Replace the natives with people of your ancestry and of course they'll feel more for you than for whoever the territory originally belonged to.

&gt; Oh I didn't imply that. Had we lost it would be though.

Yeah, so I commemorate the Red Army over the army that killed people I know.

&gt; You're joking? I mean please tell me you know that's not why I said Russia was almost as bad as the Nazis? You can't actually be that ignorant...

I know why you said it. I beg to differ on Russians being as bad as Nazis though.

&gt; Yeah this is exactly why I brought up you never having left the country. I don't think Britain is perfect nor would I want stay part of it if not for the economic, heath etc. benefits. I personally identify more as Irish than British. You just can't get over the little divisions you've got in your head and see that maybe it's not a terrible thing to respect servicemen and women who died for you though.

Firstly, I've left the country and been all over the world, more than most people I know anyway. I don't have ""little divisions"" in my head, as you so nicely put it. I just don't see the people who murdered my family members as having done it to fucking help me, get that into your head please? I don't care if your unionist, nationalist, republican, loyalist - protestant, catholic, Jew, Hindu, Buddhist... whatever. I am a nationalist, but I am atheist. I support Irish independence, but I hold no ill will on those who don't and I certainly live with multiple people who don't, people even with family members in the Orange Order and who have served in the RUC and British Army. The whole point of my argument is to stress that ***it is not right*** to commemorate so loudly and proudly, people who across many generations, who killed people of a certain background, across many different massacres and unjust killings. That is ***my sole argument***, if you can't get that into that head of yours, your a lost cause. Commemorating people or seeing people commemorating people who killed who you knew and loved = offensive.

The HRA meant that the ECHR could be enforced in British courts, without taking cases to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

All parliamentary legislation is supposed to comply with the HRA, and all public bodies are too. So it makes the current government grumpy because it's a check on their behaviour and a check on their power over our citizens. 

So Conservatives want to replace the HRA with a British Bill of Rights, but the main point of doing that is narrowing down the list of things that we would deem human rights. In particular they hate the controversial Article 8, which says everyone has the right to respect for one's ""private and family life, his home and his correspondence"".

There is A LOT of negative press whipped up in the (typically right wing) media about the HRA and the European Court of Human Rights. I mean it's really rare for the UK government to lose, but the very few times that they do are the cases that tend to get a lot of attention. 

Last autumn the Tories said they would have a draft British Bill of Rights ready pre-election, but it looks like that might have stalled. It would be an extremely controversial document if/when it does come out. It's a very hard thing to write, and I don't like the idea of something as fundamental to our society as this coming into law while our country is suddenly having a bit of an isolationist, xenophobic streak.

As far as I can tell, most British lawyers dislike this new idea of a British Bill of Rights, but you don't tend to come across much in the popular press explaining why the HRA is important and all the good things it's done for us.

&gt;We cannot underestimate Swansea. If they beat us tomorrow they'll only be one point behind us. We have to play a strong team.

I didn't actually realise this, although they'll have a game in hand over us. Still, it's some motivation for our lot to give it 100% tonight. Finishing above 'top 7' teams is what we want to achieve from here, after all.

&gt;Kyle Naughton guaranteed to score, but I hope we come out strong since Southampton dropped points the other day.

Why on earth would you pick Naughton over Gylfi? It should be an interesting experience for a few of our squad tonight though.

Overall, it's interesting that the Spurs fans see this game in particular is a huge match. I'm really looking forward to it myself, the pressure is off but I think we've got ample motivation.",null,0,null,1425489686,null,0,false,0,cp47ztr,null,t3_2xx01s,null,t1_cp47ztr,null,t3_2xx01s,null,null,null,1427576652,null,4,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,4,null

The dangers you're looking at are really not so surprising. In fact they're the natural result of technological progression. As a species advances more and more, the possibility for catastrophic events increases. 500 years ago, the most damage one person could do was knock down their enemy's castle. Now we have the power to destroy whole cities with a single bomb. In another 100 years, the average person may be able to create a weapon that could destroy all of Earth. Perhaps in 1000 years they could destroy a whole solar system, and perhaps in 10000 years they could destroy a galaxy. This is the danger of technological advance before society can adapt to keep up.

The thing that happened to the Doctor's TARDIS would've never been possible when the Time Lords were around.

Because you repeatedly insist that it is somehow a sign of approval of the every action of the British army.

And *again* you don't have to wear one, but banning them from being sold is pathetic.

 &gt;do you see how commemorating or showing support, or seeing people support the murderers of my family, can be offensive? I can't make it any simpler for you.

Okay i'll make this very simple. You do not have to wear it. However, you have no right to complain about others wearing it or the sale of it unless they are deliberately celebrating your families deaths. Which I guarantee is less than 4 people total. 
&gt;Sources please.

[Can you really not google the fucking wiki page?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Lily_%28badge%29).
 
&gt;I see it as the full island 

Yeah well it's not and one day you'll have to grow up and accept that like a big boy.

&gt;The Falklands, for example. Replace the natives with people of your ancestry and of course they'll feel more for you than for whoever the territory originally belonged to.

Ah yes the Falklands, famously inhabited before the Brits by that famous native group the...oh no wait...no the Falklands never had a native group...While we're at it should we bring all those Irish-Americans back and give America back to the natives? Or shall we move on and let self-determination decide? I'm thinking we move on and not repeat the mistakes of history and force people out of their homes where they and their families have lived for hundreds of years.

&gt;I know why you said it.

Do you? Why not mention the Gulags and the execution of anyone who disagreed with the regime rather than shooting deserters then? I'm pretty sure your history is just a bit shaky. Sure lets ask those Falkland natives what they think?

&gt;Yeah, so I commemorate the Red Army over the army that killed people I know.

Okay fine, I don't really care. Still not really a reason to ban poppy sales though.

&gt;I just don't see the people who murdered my family members as having done it to fucking help me, get that into your head please? 

I'd say why this is bullshit and misrepresenting my argument but I have a few times already so I don't think there's any point.

&gt; I am a nationalist, but I am atheist.

...that's nice...good for you?

&gt;Firstly, I've left the country and been all over the world, more than most people I know anyway.

Have you lived outside it? Not been on holiday, actually experienced another culture that isn't this divided mess.

&gt;I don't have ""little divisions"" in my head, as you so nicely put it.

You really seem to, you don't seem to be capable of separating anyone who died, even if they were Irish, from this big bad evil army that killed people you know. It's pathetic.

 &gt;The whole point of my argument is to stress that it is not right to commemorate so loudly and proudly

So what would you do to remember the dead of WW1 and WW2? Do we just pretend they don't exist? Are we only allowed to celebrate things that affected the world if Britain played no role in them?

&gt;Commemorating people or seeing people commemorating people who killed who you knew and loved = offensive.

So can we get back to banning the Tricolour because there were men who used that as a symbol for killing members of my community? What about those people who commemorate Bobby Sands every year? Or anyone who commemorates any aspect of the troubles? Lets just ban anyone form ever talking about it or any symbol that it ever happened because someone might be offended.

The general rule is that if you don't have a credit record, supplying a guarantor should be enough. I think the agency are taking you for a ride or trying to push you away. 

Deposits are normally made by direct bank transfer. Never carry that much cash in person.

Besides, to secure the place, you don't need to pay the deposit- you only need to pay the agency fees. The deposit is irrelevant- it's just security against damage to the property.

You would need to go to the branch to sign the tenancy contract (called assured shorthold tenancy contract) unless an agent is willing to meet you there, at their own discretion.

My honest advice is to find another place because I'm not sure it's worth the hassle. But that's just one man's opinion. It genuinely sounds like they're pushing you away.

That said, it's somewhat unusual for a place to be gone in a matter of minutes. In fact, I rarely ever offered during the viewing. I normally say ""I'll get back to you by the end of the day"". Unless the place is an absolute catch.

The rental market here is ruthless.  I've had exactly the experience you did.  It's not uncommon to have to race to the letting agency to put down a deposit.  However, it is more usual for the agency to take both applications and let the landlord decide.  If you are offering 6 months rent in advance, you would most likely win out in that situation.

If you are prepared to carry that much cash with you, it can be worthwhile.  This has been successful for me in the past - but some letting agents will say that you have to go to the office to sign forms.  Obviously, make sure you get a receipt if you hand over large amounts of cash.

You might want to check out gumtree.co.uk.  If you can find a private landlord and avoid the agencies, this can work out really well.  The agencies take enormous fees and add basically no value to you as a tenant.

I've also come across increases to the standard variable rate (the default rate a lender charges where the customer isn't in a fixed rate or tracker deal) when the base rate hasn't changed. Both these might be okay, depending on the circumstances. 

However, I've never heard of a fixed rate over a set term being ended early by a lender - with or without agreement from the borrower. That's very troubling, and I'd be very surprised if it was legitimate, except perhaps in particularly extreme market conditions during which the lender was really struggling and, say, needed to take the action to comply with regulatory capital requirements or to sure up its capital buffer to prevent it from collapsing. Even then, changing a fixed rate contract would be a significant step to take. In fact, if a lender did want to do this, I'd have expected it to seek approval from the regulators before doing so. 

Ask the lender to explain the increase, highlight where in the contract it gives itself the right to take that step and, if the fixed rate was ended early, what circumstances led to this decision being taken. If the answer you get isn't satisfactory, contact the Financial Ombudsman Service to ask it to look into what has happened. Here's a link to its contact details: http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/contact/index.html

One more thing - if your mother's mortgage is s buy-to-let, rather than a residential mortgage over her own home, the lender might have more freedom to vary the interest rate. Still, doubling the interest rate halfway through the term certainly doesn't feel right on the face of it, regardless of the type of mortgage.

As far as your point with Coutinho, I agree and disagree. I think you're absolutely right that we are much less of a one-man team and have a wealth of attacking options who could win us a game, but I think Coutinho is a huge part of the distribution, both in passing and movement, that leads to chances for Sterling/Sturridge/Lala (don't think that nickname will stick). 

Man-marking Coutinho would open up a lot of space behind for the other forwards, so I agree there as well. Still, that scenario still entails Coutinho on the pitch, so it supports Coutinho being the main man even if to a lesser extent. 

I'm all aboard the Allen hype train at this point, but it's true that if we have effective offensive distribution from Hendo AND Allen, it would go a long way in lessening our dependence on Coutinho.

null,false,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy",null,"&gt;  Frankly the police officer shouldn't have got so angry at such a petty comment (especially his he provoked it himself)

And before that - assuming the video cuts in at the beginning of the exchange, which we don't know - the boy questioning the police doesn't imply anything with the comment 'breaching the peace... by being homeless?'. 

It's not hard to read between the lines by his tone or by his words. 

&gt; I can see why you sympathise with him what with him being in a stressful job and all that but say if a teacher got angry with a student over a petty comment it'd be a completely different story.

Teachers do get angry with students for stupid petty comments all the time - I've seen my fair share of teachers not so long ago sending students out of classrooms for disrupting their lessons and / or being a pain the arse. The police couldn't arrest this boy for his tone - which is a good thing - but having to put up with it is no less frustrating and unnecessary. 

&gt; Bottom line is if you can't get over little comments made by the public especially when they're not particularly malicious or offensive then you shouldn't really put yourself in a postion where you're likely to recieve such comments on a frequent basis.

Again you're judging from a position of ignorance. That isn't to call you ignorant - but neither of us know the beginning of this exchange, whether the boy had said anything else that was more insulting or unnecessary before this, how long it had been going on for, what kind of day that officer had had so far... 

For all we know he could have just come from an RTC where some mother was sobbing over the remains of her mangled child lying in the road. Now this character is trying to pick an arguement over a call out that that officer was obliged to respond to. 

That's not to completely defend the officer - I've said all along that he should have just walked away in the best case. But my attention is more on the boy asking the questions and his poor decision making. His issues should have been addressed to MacDonald's chain or to the police customer service desk. Instead it looks like he wanted some sensationalist youtube content and baited the officer into providing it.

The *actual* bottom line is that when a line officer is told to go to MacDonald's and deal with a homeless man creating a disturbance on private property, that officer goes. It's not for him to decide the law or what is required at a higher level. Were I in his shoes I'd have told the boy to 'fuck off' long ago but *I* am coming at it from a position where I don't have to worry about that job, career or the public face of the police force. It seems like there's quite a lot of people who agree that the kid is poorly informed and being a pain the arse and perhaps *needs* to be told to fuck off by someone, rather than given the time of day. 

The only tragedy would be he'd probably waste no time in making a villain of the police officer unlucky enough to tell him to do so. ",null,0,null,1425492311,null,0,false,0,cp49n8c,null,t3_2xvrx5,null,t1_cp49n8c,null,t1_cp47wi1,null,null,null,1427577491,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The episode does. You don't need to.

&gt;But, he could have seen from a distance what happened maybe while in the same time period.

The Time Lords were around in this period. They'd have noticed him bumping into himself. The only times they did happen they (or something equally powerful) were involved so as to not completely break the first rule of time.

When I mentioned The Day of the Doctor special, the war doctor now knows part of what happens in his future... Multiple times. He knows his tenth and eleventh incarnation. Maybe future incarnations don't remember when their past selves met them, which might explain why ten doesn't remember meeting war or eleven and same for eleven.

""I won't remember this will I""?

""I won't remember either"".

&gt;But war does and it affects his choices.

Who said his choice changed? The episode seems to imply more heavily history never actually changed. Plus, he did still *choose* to use it.

&gt;But by that logic, I messed up because ten would remember his future incarnation, just not war. Maybe that's why he was so reluctant to go. Didn't lime the chin and hair. Something against bow ties and fezzes. Can't stand fish fingers and custard. Who knows. Time is wibbly wobbly. And yet, due to timing of the special, obviously it makes tens story so much more different.

""I won't remember either"".

&gt;Yani (Master) is no longer the only other time lord. So, now we talk paradoxes.

He might be. The Time Lords still haven't returned. They may stay in a separate universe forever. Besides, if they did intervene, they'd prevent the Tenth Doctor regenerating, becoming the Eleventh Doctor and going to Trenzalore. They needed the Doctor to not know there were any Time Lords left.

&gt; Doctors don't like paradoxes. So, it's more likely that third did see Sarah Jane and Four part ways from a distance out of curiosity while in the same place/time for another adventure but didn't want it alter his own timeline.

If the Doctor hates paradoxes, the Fourth Doctor wouldn't have gone anywhere he'd know the Third Doctor was going to be.

Essentially it is like doing A levels, but covered in one year. How worth it it is for you will depend on how strong your maths, biology, chemistry and physics are.

It gives you an introduction to uni life, so you already have that done and friends made before you go in to the first year of the main degree, but also gives the chance to change your mind and move to a different course.

Foundation years are often a mixture of people who just missed out on grades for whatever reason and mature students (do not worry about being older than everyone, I am several years older than you and still been able to make loads of friends).

I think if you do the FY over A-level you'll be more likely to be able to progress into year 1 if you're concerned about not being able to get the results. Plus there's the change to get tutoring when at a Uni already as well as the good range of support services.

null,false,EireOfTheNorth,null,null,null,"&gt; Because you repeatedly insist that it is somehow a sign of approval of the every action of the British army. It's not, nor is showing support for the people currently serving a show of support for their every action. Once again, it's not even a solely British thing. And again you don't have to wear one, but banning them from being sold is pathetic.

It specifically says on the British Legions website that it is a show of support for those currently serving. It does not say ""except in cases we object"" anywhere. It's an army/military action support club, which is pathetic in itself - a country should aim to be peaceful, and not fetishize combat or the support of those in combat for, largely, ignoble causes..

&gt; you have no right to complain about others wearing it or the sale of it unless they are deliberately celebrating your families deaths.

They are celebrating the army that killed a significant amount of the populace here in the last few decades. Therefore, it's an offensive emblem. By wearing it in Mid-Ulster its like wearing a Swastika in a Jewish neighbourhood. It's like wearing the Easter Lily in Tigers Bay or Sandy Row. It's not acceptable.

&gt; Why not mention the Gulags and the execution of anyone who disagreed with the regime

Because its completely unrelated to the Red Army fighting the Nazis. And is a step further away from the main debate. Nowhere have I stated I am a Stalinist, or whatever you're trying to get at here.

&gt; Have you lived outside it? Not been on holiday, actually experienced another culture that isn't this divided mess.

Yes. Yes, and yes.

&gt; You really seem to, you don't seem to be capable of separating anyone who died, even if they were Irish, from this big bad evil army that killed people you know. It's pathetic.

By supporting the poppy I would be by default supporting, amongst others, the murderers of my family members. That's enough to stop me from ever supporting them. Don't really think its pathetic to be bitter over a murder that has still not been discussed in court thanks to the totally healthy judiciary system Britain has in place.

&gt; So what would you do to remember the dead of WW1 and WW2? Do we just pretend they don't exist? Are we only allowed to celebrate things that affected the world if Britain played no role in them?

Have an emblem specifically designed for WW1 or WW2. Simple. The Poppy helps current servicemen and commemorates, amongst others, corrupt servicemen that served here.

&gt; So can we get back to banning the Tricolour because there were men who used that as a symbol for killing members of my community?

Not really, it's the flag of a country - it doesn't fetishize military actions, it does the opposite - it represents peace between those of Celtic heritage and those of 'Orange' heritage. Furthermore, it wasn't and has never been sold in government buildings - at least here in the north.

&gt; What about those people who commemorate Bobby Sands every year? Or anyone who commemorates any aspect of the troubles?

You can commemorate it, as long as its non-inflammatory, in a community that unanimously supports the commemoration, nobody should be forced to swallow down that shit.

&gt; Get off your high horse, the poppy isn't a symbol of the trouble and if you really get offended at the sight of anything British you are fucked when you grow up.

My high horse, lol. Alright I'm on a high horse for seeing something that actively helps the murderers of my family as offensive. No baw.

Six days later he was down to that last £3.44 (which he was unable to withdraw since it was less than £5). He died a fortnight later.

...

&gt;The DWP says Clapson was told during a phone call on 16 July that he could fill out a form to request hardship funds. He was sent a letter (dated 15 July) explaining how to apply for them, but his sister found it unopened in his flat. ""He was very bad at opening letters. People in his situation are frightened of these letters. They are never good news,"" she says. Had he opened it, he might have found the language confusing. ""We cannot pay you your Jobseekers' Allowance from 28 June 2013,"" the letter reads. ""This is because we recently told you that a decision would be made about a doubt: on whether you failed to comply with the requirements of the scheme to which you have been referred.""
