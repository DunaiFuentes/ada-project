I don't know: a lot of people do talk about Rodgers not playing with DMs, but he tends to pick Lucas when he's fit, and he played Leon Britton as a genuine DM at Swansea.

Do Liverpool spend that on a DM, debatably a covered position, or on other priorities?

&gt;In an interview with Newsnight, Acott says:

&gt;MI5 was completely unprepared for the Islamist terror threat and was so short-staffed during one major plot that it had to rely on British Transport Police to follow terrorist suspects

&gt;The agency had so few non-white officers that one team leader considered ""blacking-up"" agents - this was tried on a training exercise

&gt;The agency had to undertake some surveillance operations because of suspicions of corruption and leaks within the police

&gt;He challenged senior managers when his team was tasked with looking at a suspected paedophile. Acott considered this beyond the agency's remit. The operation lasted several weeks, but he says he saw no evidence of child abuse


&gt;""(MI5) was totally understaffed. We weren't used to dealing with the way they acted. The good thing about following Irish targets is the Active Service Units would generally meet in pubs you could go into.

&gt;""The Islamists would meet round each other's houses or in mosques which you can't get away with going into. Also, they were living in mostly ethnic areas and often you would find the only white people on the street were surveillance officers.""

&gt;The surveillance on the suspected paedophile - codenamed Operation Saturday - caused him concern, he says, because he couldn't understand why MI5 was doing it.

&gt;It involved extremely powerful, wealthy people. It was a very need to know job... We were given the scantest of briefings on it. All of a sudden the job stopped. I did actually question why were we doing paedophiles - it wasn't in our remit.

&gt;""The trouble with the police is they move from job to job. Special Branch only do it for three or four years. Then they go onto CID or some other job. There was a strong suspicion of corruption within the police, whereas MI5 was more highly trusted.""

Yes, you've said that twice now. Maybe you'll understand better if I operationalise it a bit. 


100 people in a room. 50 like blue pencils. 50 like red pencils. 20 people in the room who like blue pencils aren't registered to vote. A vote is held on blue vs red and red wins, 50/30. It is pointed out that this isn't reflective of the needs of the people as 20 of the people haven't registered to vote. Someone else says ""yes but they're irrelevant, they can't vote"" 

Just because they can't vote doesn't mean the support isn't there, and yes they shouldn't be allowed vote but the fact is that your statement of how Sinn Fein rely on Eastern European votes is false because Sinn Fein could have so many more votes if they went out and voted. That's not satire, that's logical.


&gt; Lol. Last time i checked unionism was split 2/3 for the dup and 1/3 for the uup. Pretty much the same with sinn fein and the sdlp. Are you forgetting the disgusting bullying in Fermanagh and South Tyrone by sinn fein members and supporters aimed at the sdlp candidate. Simply because he was a second nationalist candidate.


Yes and those 1/3 voters were forced into voting for a party they wouldn't normally vote for. Again what is your point here? And how is bringing up Republican bad behaviour relevant? Unless there's actually a pact made that's as relevant as me saying ""are you forgetting Peter Robinson's comments on gay marriage?"" 


&gt; So you defended a legitimate ""us and them"" leaflet by sinn fein


No I didn't. I expressly stated it was wrong and in bad taste. What I did was say it wasn't as atrocious as people were making out. If people called Orangemen terrorists I would say that was unfair, it wouldn't mean I'm ""defending the Orange Order"", but I guess asking a Unionist not to straw-man is a bit unrealistic.


&gt; You're also forgetting that Sinn Fein has approached the sdlp to have a pact for the past 3 Westminster elections


Again, I never defended that? Are you just making up arguments you feel you can win now? I'm against pacts of all kinds for both sides? Can I ask where you thought I defended a Sinn Fein pact or made an insinuation that pacts were exclusive to Unionism? 


&gt; Politicians jobs are to get elected and unionists found a good way to do that in may.


I'm going to give you the opportunity to retract that before I respond to it, I can't believe you would actually write that out with honest sincerity.

Wat? I never said that. In fact i stated the opposite.

Unless there's actually a pact made that's a relevant as me saying ""are you forgetting Peter Robinson's comments on gay marriage""

I'm making the point that you think pacts are limited to unionists only. It really isn't irrelevant. I'm showing that a pact would of happened if sdlp wanted it to.


&gt;No I didn't. I expressly stated it was wrong and in bad taste. What I did was say it wasn't as atrocious as people were making out. If people called Orangemen terrorists I would say that was unfair, it wouldn't mean I'm ""defending the Orange Order"", but I guess asking a Unionist not to straw-man is a bit unrealistic.


You've got some unrelated abstract ways trying to make a point. 

&gt;Again, I never defended that? Are you just making up arguments you feel you can win now? I'm against pacts of all kinds for both sides? Can I ask where you thought I defended a Sinn Fein pact or made an insinuation that pacts were exclusive to Unionism?

You're advocating for eastern europeans not to vote for unionist parties because they made pacts. The you say they should vote sinn fein despite the fact sinn fein has tried multiple times to have a pact.

&gt; “It’s been said that women are less assertive cyclists than men — that may be true,” says Gilligan [London cycling ""tsar""]. The theory goes that women, on average, are less aggressive around large vehicles so may undertake on the left rather than going around the outside at junctions. This may then mean they’re invisible to the driver.

...

&gt; Rachel Aldred, senior lecturer in transport at the University of Westminster, has done extensive research into “near-misses”: women are more likely to report they’ve had a hairy, though not injuring moment: “That was partly about their cycling speed — women were cycling, on average, more slowly than men. The incident rate for people going at 12 plus mph is a third of that for people going under 8mph.”

...

&gt; Her findings on speed are backed up anecdotally by Dr Wollaston, who suggests that more women may be killed by HGVs, perversely because they are more “careful”: “I’m slower away from junctions than men. Other cyclists push ahead of me. If you’re naturally more polite, you find yourself towards the back of that box, behind other people. Then who do the lorries turn left over?

null,false,Fictional_Science,null,null,null,"Well hello there.

The sonic screwdriver is an original creation of The Doctor. However it needs ""charging"" from the TARDIS. The screwdriver can be docked into the TARDIS and/or connected wirelessly simply by being inside the TARDIS. This connection is not only to ""charge"" the screwdriver but also facilitates a transfer of data.

How did this happen? Well the doctor may have designed the screwdriver but much like his swimming pool, ball room or apiary anything he desires is manufactured by the TARDIS. The TARDIS as we know is sentient and is interested in The Doctors life and adventures. Unfortunately, he is thoughtless sometimes and wanders too far away from the TARDIS and they lose communication. The TARDIS when creating the Sonic Screwdriver imbued it with some of its own technology. This is how the sonic can regenerate and modify itself so easily. In reality its just very very clever engineering but to those of us who don't understand the science we may think its magic. If it helps you can think of it as a kind of AI that adapts to the personality of its user (that's completely wrong by the way but if it helps...).

The TARDIS uses the sonic as a way to ""record"" the adventures of The Doctor and experience moments of his life ""she"" may otherwise miss. During these data transfers the sonics ""operating system"" is captured as a snapshot (in case of destruction). When a new sonic must be created the last snapshot is used.

The Doctor simply added a calculation hidden in the depths of the sonic's OS that would keep running. The software is backed up.
""Same Software. Different Case""

During the Labour reign it was tax tax tax, everything went up every fucking year, council tax, fuel duty, fucking everything. With the coalition and now the Tories I DO have a few more quid in my pocket.

She said nobody wins when it's used poorly - particularly if used unfairly against young black men.

I think the more fortunate members of society like myself can and should help out those who aren't.

Of course, that doesn't mean I am OK with the government wasting the tax money away on inefficiency and corruption, and that would be one big reason why I don't like Labour at all. And I'm not even going to try to defend them or try to argue that they are ""the lesser of two evils"". I don't want them in charge of the country at all.

I suppose you could put my more intense hatred of Tories down to their ideology. They despise the poor and unfortunate and to any educated person, their policies are so blatantly meant to screw the poor and benefit the rich.

null,false,joshj27,null,null,null,"I think every sensible Liverpool fan accepts that you have an extremely good team. 

Sanchez is easily one of the best players in the league and every fan her is sad he didn't join us. Equally you have an abundance of very good attacking and creative midfielders; ozil is class but has been slightly up and down on form, Santi is a remarkable player and Ramsey when fit is one of the best in the league. 
Koschelney is a very good defender as well and I think with him and Cech in your defence you'll be very good this year. 

However I'm going to dispute massively the idea that Wilshere is better than Henderson. 

Firstly Wilshere has not played 30 games in a league season since he was 19. He's never been able to do a full season so all opinions of him are based off partial campaigns. Henderson is almost always fit and is a real athlete something that Wilshere time and again does his best off the field not too live up to. 

Next attacking wise Henderson is much more dangerous. He scores and creates goals at a rate way above anything Wilshere has done in his career so far. Additionally Henderson plays more key passes a game then Wilshere (source whoscored).

Defensively Henderson makes more tackles, interceptions, wins more duals and makes more clearances. A lot of stuff I've heard in favour of Wilshere says he plays deeper so that's why his offensive stats are worse. But then why are his defensive stats so much worse too. These are all averages as well so they take into account his lack of games. 

More so Henderson makes more passes a game than Wilshere and if you watch us regularly you would see his passing range is as good as Wilshere's. 

Jack Wilshere has the potential to be a real good player he's got a good engine god technique and great vision and a quality strike on him. But right now this second he has never shown the consistency, the effort or the output of Henderson.  The reason we didn't win the league 2 seasons ago was because Henderson was banned for the match against Chelsea and it changed the whole team.

TLDR; arsenal full of great players. Jack Wilshere not as good as Henderson at most things on evidence we've seen over course of a full season but bags of potential of he can get fit.",null,0,null,1437044880,null,0,false,0,ct582cj,null,t3_3dddo5,null,t1_ct582cj,null,t1_ct4laxf,null,null,null,1437898526,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Or, as we do now, by being part of the UK and having internal transfers courtesy of the Barnett formula.

The Better Together campaign simply failed to enthuse in the same manner, and of course any criticism like the above could be shouted down as ""doing down Scotland"".

That makes projected *government* spending in 2020 £122 billion, problem is we already have planned *NHS* spending for 2020 at £146.4 billion, and the existing deficit is running around £700 million per year so Osborne actually announced an extra £1.3 billion a year in funding.

The overall funding gap (planned spending vs funding) is £30 billion (£6 billion per year) between now and 2020 and the NHS is expected to find £22 billion in 'savings' (i.e. cuts) to close that gap over the same period whilst moving to a 7 day a week staffing model and executing the Stevens Report modernisation programme.

Only way to do this is cut wages at all levels while increasing hours.

What Osborne announced was actually less than a third of the money the NHS needs to operate at current service levels whilst Hunt announced a massive increase in mandated staffing hours. Basically it will translate into a real terms cut because even the chancellor admits finding £22 billion in savings is 'challenging' at best.

Red flags for me are:

* Course is not advertised on their website (Diploma in Postgraduate journalism). They can at least say they offer the course right?

* The e-mail reply is extremely unprofessional. No hi/hello. Spelling mistake in one line. All caps. No footer. It just looks unprofessional.

* The university can only offer foundation degrees.

* There is no procedure to verify the degree. I can of course get the candidate to sign off on anything but I don't even know where to send it.

Hello,

What's the proper procedure to verify the degree from you? Someone has applied to our institute while claiming to be a degree holder from your institute. I need to verify so we can make or reject the job offer.

Rodgers got a team working well together, all pulling towards the same goal. 

When he got the job at the club he had a massively detailed plan of how he was going to do things to get Liverpool to the place we need to be, and I think football owners appreciate a manager who knows exactly what they want and have a good plan on how to get it.

My only concern for Rodgers is his seeming inability to change tactics mid game and find success in doing so. We usually find a formation that works incredibly well for a long time, then once we get figured out he doesn't seem to have the ability to create a short term fix whilst he figures out a long-term solution.

Working in Soho I passionately believe we should pedestrianise there. If not possible we should at least restrict traffic to only apply to anyone who got business there. Soho should not be seen as a shortcut to get to somewhere else.

Finally while I recognise that your very good sustainable policies is good in our effort to tackle climate change, I would like us to see us going directly for tackling it as it is the most critical problem we face globally, also in London.

I am genuinely captivated by Brendan Rodgers.

Everything about him just makes me feel good on the inside. His looks, his hair, his watches, his suits, his accent. Whenever I listen to him speak about the team I just light up with joy. 

My parents lived in Iraq under Saddam Hussein and they say that whenever he would appear on the news everyone would surround the tv and listen to him and then feel good about themselves and the country.

I feel the same way about Brendan Rodgers. I have absolutely  no evidence to the fact that I so strongly believe that Brendan Rodgers will go down in the history as the greatest manager, along side Bill Shankly ( god have mercy on his soul ) of the Liverpool Football Club. And if he is sacked I will whole heatedly mourn for not what could have been but should have been.

I feel like Brendan Rodgers was born to lead Liverpool to glory.

Atleti won't be willing to pay a lot as Luis is at a ""lower status"" compared to when he left the club an year ago and thus will not be willing to pay much. Deal will be off if money demanded is too high. And Atleti will look elsewhere if Luis can't be brought back.

A reason people dislike the Conservatives because well over half seem to support a repeal of the fox hunting ban - including their leader. 

If they put it to a vote in the house and the repeal was successful, you couldn't then say well a good number actually opposed it. Because well the vote wouldn't have passed if the majority didn't. 

The question is why do people hate the Conservatives. One of the answers is that the majority support the repeal. If it wasn't for opposition from other parties it would be repealed. So people hate them for that. 

I feel like I'm just repeating myself but I am really struggling to see the point in saying there are some MPs within the party who are against it. Not sure what that proves. If you care about foxes you shouldn't hate the Conservatives because well under half care too?

It was a bit of a weird place to work, unsurprisingly full of students so after work there was a fairly high likelihood of everyone pissing off down the pub to spend their meagre wages. I enjoyed working with some of the people there, it was fairly relaxed.

Possibly a bit too relaxed, there were a lot of people taking various drugs, often while on shift, including a few who would have bumps of k under their desks, always boggled the mind how the hell you could telephone chug on k but hey, each to their own. The manager was/is a known coke head and would disappear up to the bogs fairly regularly during shift. He was also a total wanker to work for, would often belittle staff, when he found out that I had applied for another job he pulled me aside to ask why and to tell me that I would never amount to anything so my best option was to stay with NTT. I thanked him for his advice and got out as soon as possible. During a normal working day however I very rarely had to interact with him, the team leaders were all ok to work for.

Politics in this country is just a string of false accusations and attacks on superficial characteristics (which isn't to say Labour aren't also guilty of the same thing, but Labour have been losing the propaganda war most recently). To an extent the sensibility of chosen policy doesn't matter as long as it's announced by someone with a shiny face and you can shout inane attacks against your opponent loud enough. 

But yes, Conservatives are masters at taking something complicated, reducing the argument down to something so basic it is no longer representative of the truth but fits on an advertisement board and has the correct spin and then flooding the media with their guff. If Corbyn wins I'll be glad to actually have a choice between blue Conservatives or red Conservatives, but it will just set up the Conservative propaganda machine for the coup de grace.

This was how Michael Lewis sets it up in the book when talking about how baseball scouts would sign players based on physique and stature. ""He'll hit home runs alright"". They looked like athletes so they got signed but didn't always convert on the field.

The moneyball idea was to ignore that subjective observation and compute a variety of stats and challenge the notion that ""home runs"" (I'm over-simplifying) were a viable metric for player performance. Getting on base became a more important metric. Which makes sense in baseball. If you're never on base you're never going to be able to score a run.

How often is any given motorway a total car park because of ""an accident involving an HGV""? Far too often.

It would be easy enough to do. Truck drivers have to take a certain number of breaks, so it could be built into that. Part of your break is that one hour period.

If the parking company rejects that dispute then you can take it through POPLA which is an independent appeals adjudicator. There's a lot more info on the MoneySavingExpert forums. 

If you've been parking for free, then your dispute should be no problem (providing you aren't required to pay). A few more details about the parking situation would be good.

Also, by appealing you don't accept liability. Just don't admit that it was you who was driving.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"I really don't think thats the case at all. The medical workforce just isn't like that. 

The UK already has relatively low doctors:per head of population. It's not like train drivers where you can sack them, then just recruit new ones from a pool of available workers. All the available doctors are already in the workforce since it isn't a career with an unemployed overhead. If you remove staff from the workforce, they don't get replaced from some pool of doctors waiting to take up jobs.

No, the governments motive is to open up the service to 7 day working because, just like in a factory, it's essentially a way of boosting capacity without having to expand your facilities. By opening up the factory on saturday you increase the amount of product you can produce, without having to buy any new machines. The only issue is staffing the factory... thats where the NHS struggles. 

The problem is, like I said above, the NHS doesn't have a big pool of available workers. The staff that are available are already all in the workforce. So, if you want to open the factory on saturday and sunday, you can only do it by staffing it with people who *would* have been at work during the week. So instead of having 100% staffing monday to friday, you end up with something like 60-70% staffing monday to sunday. This causes problems for the NHS.

The other issue is that a lot of non-urgent services aren't available at the weekend. For example, most hospitals (even large tertiary referral centres like University College Hospital/St.Georges etc.) don't necessarily have things like MRI scanners available at the weekend. So then you have the problem that the factory is staffed, but the machines aren't working so they can't make any product... getting around that isn't necessarily straightforward - because then you aren't just talking about getting several thousand consultants in at the weekend, you're talking about getting tens or even hundreds of thousands of support staff in at the weekend to. It also means that maintenance that tends to get done at the weekends can't be done. It also means the entire NHS support infrastructure also needs to be able to support the increase in workload... thats everything from companies that manufacture medical equipment and consumables to things like waste handling, equiptment cleaning services etc.

The BMA (the doctors union) acknowledges there is a need to boost staffing at the weekend because of the safety aspect. But they don't necessarily agree with the efficiency aspect (and that's really what the government is driving for). Remember aswell, a lot of those doctors worked 60-70+ hour weeks for most of their lives. Reaching a consultant post is meant to incorporate better standard of living. Equally, by that age, (around 37-43+ years old) a lot of those doctors are looking to spend less time at work and more time with their families, whom they tend to have later than the general population average. It's going to be very difficult to convince those people to give up their golden goose for working hard all those years... especially if you don't have some big financial incentive to lure them with.",null,0,null,1437047894,null,0,1437048205,0,ct58yxh,null,t3_3dh9o1,null,t1_ct58yxh,null,t1_ct56vw8,null,null,null,1437899127,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

What Labour missed was that teh Great Crash of 2008 was very very different from the early '80's recession and the early '90's recession. This time interest rates *fell* rather than rose because it was a deflationary recession rather than an inflationary one.

So say you were paying a mortgage of £700 per month in 2008 - the interest rate cuts make that £500 per month. If you've held onto your job - and the majority did - then boom, you are wealthier. You use the extra disposable income to pay off debt, you build savings, suddenly you are open to the savings tax breaks teh Conservatives are offering, and inheritance tax and all the rest, because suddenly you have assets.

Whereas in the early '90's recession, interest rates *rose*, which meant mortgage payments increased, which hurt a lot of middle England and made them poorer. Which meant they wanted an alternative and Blair was waiting and they fell into his hands like a plum.

This is why I get so impatient with people who keep trying to recreate the past - we can't because conditions are different. Labour has *never* faced conditions like we have now - where there are a significant number of home-owners, people with assets, people with with education, people who want to hold onto their stuff.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"I'm not sure I'd agree. I've certainly seen situations arise where a single SHO can end up covering 200-300 medical beds in a tertiary referral centre on their own at a weekend, with maybe a single registrar available in the acute medical unit to answer questions, and a post-take consultant who has gone home by 11am.

Lets face it though, the government aren't interested in the safety aspect - they want this because its a way of boosting efficiency and capacity without having to hire more staff or create more hospital beds. The problem with that is by the time doctors have reached a consultant post they've already spent the better party of two decades working 50-70 hour weeks, and hardly want to give up their reward for working hard all those years. It also tends to coincide with a point in life where they're about 40 years old and facing changing priorities in life... with young families to spend time with etc. Without being able to offer them some big financial incentive for doing this, I suspect it will be very difficult to convince them to take on more weekend work.

It's one thing doing a lot of weekends as an SHO or a registrar, and it's common for those grades to work as many as 1 in 3 weekends in some specialties, but at 40 years old if your wife and kids are off on the weekends then thats when you want to be off work as well.


I also suspect that while the government are selling this as weekend ward cover, what they really want to see are things like outpatient clinics and elective lists running at the weekends. That way elective beds are filled over the weekend which lowers waiting times without actually increasing the number of theatres/surgeons/nurses/beds.

While I can certainly see the appeal of opening things like audiology services at the weekend from a patient perspective, the problem is it's not as simple as staffing outpatients with 2-3 nurses and a consultant. 

You need to have things like radiology operating a full service - else you can't investigate people coming through the door until monday-friday anyway. And radiology certainly do NOT run at the weekend. It's uncommon even in a tertiary referral centre for things like MRI to be available at weekends. Typically radiology at the weekend is run by an on call service, which in a 2000 bed hospital could be as little as two registrars and a consultant available by phone. Phlebotomy (which is a service not a department) and acute medicine do not run a full service at weekends, though the latter tends to be better staffed than the general medical wards in a larger hospital. Smaller hospitals like district generals tend to share a single group of doctors between the wards and acute medical unit. Probably the worst staffed areas of the hospital are general medicine and surgery, which of course makes up the vast majority of any hospitals inpatient beds. Some specialties like oncology also have very poor weekend cover. 

Really the only departments that run a full service monday to friday are intensive care and to some extent obstetrics - which even in a large hospital of say 1500 beds will only amount to about 15 intensive care beds. High dependency units (particularly surgical units since these are generally for elective admissions) don't even tend to run a full weekend service).

However, a record of it is still made on the Police National Computer, which makes you ineligible to receive a second PND for the same offence.  Similarly, there will still be a record of your arrest.  Although neither the PND nor the arrest are convictions, these can both be disclosed during an enhanced DBS check, which your security clearance is likely to need.

As to the question of whether it will affect your clearance - almost certainly not.  Security clearance is looking for a history of dishonesty, links to organised criminals or terrorists, and factors which might make you susceptible to outside pressure (e.g. mental illness which might make you more suggestible; extreme debt which might make you more susceptible to bribes).  Presumably you have none of these.

And, as another poster points out, the question is moot anyway - you must disclose your prior history.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"The problem is the NHS, unlike say Tesco, cannot simply pull more staff from a pool of available workers. The training times are incredibly long and the number of people suitable for training is comparatively small. In a simple way - lots of people can work at Tesco express, but not a lot of people can be doctors. If you need more staff at tesco, you put an advert out and train up some new staff in a matter of days or weeks. If you need more doctors you're looking at 5-7 years before they come on tap... and training people for that length of time is enormously expensive.  

There aren't really any unemployed doctors, so you can't simply pull more doctors into the workforce. So if you start increasing the number of weekend shifts as you propose, the flipside is you have to reduce the number of weekday shifts. 

The other problem is that whilst people who work at Tesco express tend to be 20-35, consultants tend to be older than about 35-40. They have different life priorities by that point. A lot of them will have young families (as they tend to have families late due to the long training times). It's going to be very hard to convince them to give up precious weekend family time in exchange for nothing. 

The other issue is that whilst tesco is built around a buisness model of 7 day working (if anything weekends are better staffed as these are busy times of the week) the NHS is not. The NHS support infrastructure is built around a monday to friday working week. It's everything from secretaries, porters, nurses, phlebotomists etc. who would need to be boosted at the weekends to support the additional workload the consultants would generate. Then there is the massive NHS logistical supply chain, which does everything from supply sterile equipment to dispose of biohazardous waste.

Culturally and historically the people of the UK are used to being parts of big institutions which have their own bureaucracies. The people of this country are generally of the queue-forming rule abiding types.

Playing by the rules is important to the image of U.K. to itself (I'm perfectly willing to accept the UK breaks rules all over the place, but it's about appearing to be in the right, have the moral high ground), whereas in other countries there is a lot of picking and choosing which rules you abide to. 

The attitude I find in this country is that either we all play by all the rules, or else there is no point having rules. I find that this is the crux of most people's objection with european government in this country, what's the point of joining an institution and playing by it's rules when all the other members don't play by the rules and shut down any attempt to change said rules. We are spending time and effort trying to change the rules of the EU, when all the other members are happy to pay the fine that allows them to ignore the rules.

You might think it's more prudent to adopt the approach of paying the fine as a more practical course of action, but it highlights a fundamental ideological failing which undermines the whole union in a lot of peoples eyes.

The problem I have with finishing fifth is there are always three or four games every season that we easily should have won or drawn at least and when we only miss out by 3 or 4 points, it's incredibly frustrating, especially when it reaches that point with 4 or 5 games left to go and you know there is no hope of closing the gap.  I understand that every team loses these games occasionally, but for us it's always one or two more than the top four.  On the other hand, we won a fair few games last season we perhaps shouldn't have, so I suppose it's a fair result for our quality.

I think ultimately it comes down to wanting to feel  like we are putting in a solid effort and if that doesn't work out that's ok, I just hate to see us lose to bottom 5 teams because we played down on their level and those losses or draws costing us fourth or better.

TLDR:  Fifth is ok, but I want us to be fun to watch in the process and keep it close down the stretch.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"This isn't strictly true. It's true doctors do work in shifts, but to give you an idea...

9-5pm monday to friday doctors are organized into groups called ""firms"". These are teams usually made up of a consultant, a registrar and 1 or 2 juniors. They have a ""list"" of patients they look after in the hospital - usually between 20 and 40 depending on the specialty and the time of year. After 5pm a single doctor, or group of doctors takes over responsibility for many firms patients. They don't routinely review them in most areas. The only patients who will get routine reviews out of hours are in areas like intensive care which are usually fully staffed (or nearly fully staffed) for 7 day working, and will have full handovers (i.e. one doctor leaving will tell another doctor coming on shift the full situation and history of the patients they have been looking after). This does not happen outside of these areas. Only patients who are extremely unwell get handed over out of hours in areas like medicine, surgery or oncology (and those beds make up the vast majority of a hospitals inpatient beds).  

So outside of 9-5pm, monday to friday, a patient in a medical, surgical or oncology bed will not have access to a doctor that individually knows them. Those out of hours teams rely on the medical notes to know whats going on. It isn't necessarily ideal in every situation.

So whilst you are correct in some respects to say the NHS operates a shfit system for doctors, it isn't necessarily as straightforward as that... and it certainly isn't that straightforward when it comes to consultants, who have fewer weekend and night commitments than registrars and juniors. So many consultants do NOT work shifts, but rather have a rolling 8-5pm monday:friday rolling rota made up of clinical sessions.",null,0,null,1437050199,null,0,1437050456,0,ct59tbe,null,t3_3dh9o1,null,t1_ct59tbe,null,t1_ct57k8e,null,null,null,1437899715,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

He's also good comedic value, he rocked up to my school in 2010 with his miner's helmet on (presumably forgetting that none of us can remember a time when there were mines in Blyth Valley) and he accidentally admitted to having a horse fetish on National Fetish Day a couple of years ago.

He's never been a minister or anything and has stayed in the SCG which I can respect, although I perhaps wish he and other north-east MPs had a bit more clout in the government or shadow cabinet, considering none of them (David Miliband aside) really got an oar in under New Labour.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"ICU is very much a 7 day department, so I wouldn't use that as a comparison for the wards. I don't know obviously whether you ever had to cover a ward shift - but they work very differently. 

To give you an example; a 30 bed intensive care unit might have 1 consultant, 1 registrar and 3 SHOs at the weekend. So that's 5 doctors for 30 beds... 

In contrast, 300 medical beds spread across about 15 wards will be staffed by a 1 registrar and 2 juniors. There *might* be a consultant until around midday. The acute medical unit probably has a similar number for about 40 beds. 

So whereas ICU has 5 doctors for 30 patients, the medical wards and acute medical unit will between them have about the same number of doctors for 300-350 patients... it's a very different way of working.

The other thing to consider is that at night time the ICU doctors will be replaced almost 1 for 1 at the weekend. So 5 doctors going home will be replaced by about 4 coming on... and will fully handover every single patient in detail, which will probably take about an hour.

Since she was there from the beginning the TARDIS could tell why she was there. From there the TARDIS would know her entire timeline including this moment. (And there was no explanation for that incarnation of Clara to know he should take that specific TARDIS instead of any other one.)

The scenes show them inside the TARDIS making calculation but the TARDIS is devoid of windows so they could have been helping while not knowing the TARDIS was doing what she was doing. The doctor never really passed his drivers test for it. 

This gave the TARDIS a way to find itself, I mean it can make backup of rooms that haven't been made yet.

This is the time vortex where the whole of time and space crashes into itself. 

OR

It was the 'moment'. I always had a theory that the moment was the choice, it showed the exact future he needed to see. And gave its power to the TARDIS to make this happen throughout its own timeline. Obviously with time altering powers. 

I'm not completely sure the moment is a weapon. Maybe it was designed to do what it did, not to blow up a galaxy but to show the user the way to fix the problem, so if it needed to blow something up it would bring the user to a weapons shop and have the user buy a bomb. It's not something that directly causes the action but indirectly leads the user to a solution that wouldn't have occurred to him any other way. In the end the moment stop the three doctors from pressing the button just before they were going to do it, maybe the whole button thing didn't do anything.

He was a brilliant player then (although I'm pretty sure anyone of his level would have seemed absolutely Godlike playing against someone like me) and also seems to have performed well in his brief performances for Chelsea and particularly in his stints at Malaga and Vitesse (mostly Vitesse). I will admit I was not able to follow his performance at Eintracht closely. 

Anyways, I think it would be a shame if we let him slip away. At the risk of sounding biased I believe he would be a great addition to our strikeforce; he has great pace and is an even greater finisher. In the long run I am a strong believer that we could mold him into a world class player (or so I hope).

BR is under huge amounts of pressure - he knows better than anyone else, including us, that if this season starts badly, or Benteke doesn't work, he'll be out the door faster than anyone can say ""Andy Carroll"". With that in mind, there is no way he'll be taking this decision lightly, there's no way BR would be willing to fork out this amount of dosh for a striker he wasn't absolutely convinced would significantly add to our team. 

On another note, we have to bear in mind that he's coming in as a competitive first 11 striker - not a superstar. It's easy to forget just how good and lethal Sturrige is when fit, but let's not forget that he really is an outstanding (league leading) goal scorer. Benteke is a fantastic option to have as 2nd choice, and is not only a massive upgrade on last years options, but I'd still rank him head and shoulders above Ings and Origi for now. 

For those asking why we're not in for Lacazette - there's nothing to suggest we weren't, but we have to accept that as a non-CL club chances are good we probably would have been gazumped by someone else - He's the best striking prospect in Europe (IMO). During that, we would have risked missing out on Benteke, and I'm in no doubt as to the role this rumoured Man Utd interest played in our decision to bite the bullet and pay the clause - can you imagine the shitstorm if after all this, they'd bought him and we 'missed out' on our supposedly first choice striker target? 

All in all, I'm backing him to be a success. The pressure is still massively on for Rodgers, even more so now, but no one is more aware of that than the man himself. We've done absolutely spectacular Business so far this Summer, and there's still over a month of the window left. 

Let's get behind this club, and back the new boys. I, for one, am extremely excited about the new season already!

As others have said your primary complaint seems to be against the new bank for not doing what they said they would, assuming your recollection is correct.  From the old bank's point of view it would appear that you vanished without leaving a forwarding address and in debt - now you've paid that debt off they're under no obligation to let you have the money back (or at least they wouldn't be in the UK).

&gt; it turns out the bank had not closed his credit card and it had been revoked (?) and he owed about 800 Euros on the card.

What were these charges for?  Had someone been charging your account fraudulently or did he honestly think the bank would let him close an account with several hundred Euros outstanding on it?

&gt;  Is the bank responsible or are we for trusting that they would do as they promised?

As I said primary responsibility would seem to lie with the new bank for not doing what they said they would.  That said you haven't helped yourself; there's a saying ""trust but verify"".  It's fine to let the new bank take responsibility for closing your old account but you owe it to yourself to verify that this has actually been done because mistakes do happen and it has the potential to bite you in the arse later, as indeed it has.  Again I don't know Ireland but in the UK every bank account I've closed has sent out some kind of closing statement or acknowledgement as confirmation.  Until I get that I assume the account is very much alive.  You also apparently knew, or should've spotted, that some direct debits hadn't transferred.  This should've rung alarm bells that the transfer hadn't gone smoothly.

The fact that you believe you might accidentally have used the wrong card after you thought the account was closed also doesn't speak well for your organisational skills.  If you genuinely thought the account was defunct then the card should have been destroyed.  It certainly shouldn't have been lying around somewhere it was easier to get to than the cards for the account you wanted to use.",null,0,null,1437052765,null,0,false,0,ct5ay25,null,t3_3dhp8l,null,t1_ct5ay25,null,t3_3dhp8l,null,null,null,1437900478,null,6,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,6,null

It was also never going to be easy for Kaboul to come from an injury that pretty much prevented him kicking a ball for two seasons, into the team we played with last season.

He was never going to be offered the same time to grow (or regrow) into the position last season with us.  Still put in a couple of good shifts - and his performance versus Arsenal where he was just outstanding will stay in the memory for a while.

- Overpriced--but I think we fans these days worry about this. Let the accountants worry about that shit! To the extent that it didn't prevent us getting other targets, the price doesn't matter that much to me. You have to put it in context of the environment (need, desperation of buying/selling club, upside, etc).

- As an armchair coach, not sure he's the type of striker we needed. This for me is what fans should be more worried about than the price.

- We simply by the laws of psychics cannot be any worse in attack than we were last season. it's just not possible.

- Come on, he's better than Andy Carroll and Rickie Lambert. But he's not Suarez. We need to stop thinking of every striker as Suarez.

- Returning to the overpriced thing, he's clearly the striker the team wanted. If that was the case, then might as well pay up and get him in. These transfer sagas are no good. Villa had a price, they didn't HAVE TO sell, so we were always going to have to pay up. if he's the player we wanted, we needed to get in ASAP.

He's big, which means he can cover the ball well even though he's quite bad with the ball at his feet. If anything, his touch seems worse than Balotelli's and reminds me more of Andy Carroll. Then again, arguably ball control was the only thing Balotelli ever had so there's that.

Anyway, he's obviously better than Balotelli and will probably bag some goals. But as it is now, I don't think he'd do better than Ings or Origi if they were all given the same chance - but I don't think they'll be given the same chances as he will considering his price tag. Origi will unfortunately rot on the bench as Sturridge gets well. 

But, I'm a Liverpool fan and I'd love for him to show me wrong. It's not my money so I don't care about the price.

Best tip is there's nothing stopping you giving a running commentary during your test, so that the examiner knows exactly what you're thinking and planning on doing.

They're not allowed to respond to direct questions, other than to clarify his instructions, but you can still chat away saying ""I'd better get out of this bus lane.  That guy on my left looks like he's going to try and come into my lane"" etc.  That way if a similar situation comes up again, your examiner will know what you're trying to do.

The only ""Own Brand"" that I do buy is Tesco's select Whiskey because I know it's really good. And my poison is strong, Martinis aren't kiddie drinks. 

But I know for a fact that I can go without. I haven't had a drink since a dirty martini in February. However if I was an alcoholic I couldn't live without a drink. I would be on the special brew and ""Canadian Spirits"" like well... an alcoholic. The idea here is that economic incentives will get people to not drink as much. 

Now even poorer people have standards... Even when I was a student I didn't drink special brew (except for one can to see what it was like). The thing is this is a minimum pricing. A can of beer cannot be sold at less than a quid (most beer is higher) and the only thing affected are the absolute scummiest of drinks. 

FYI? IF we look at the damage alcohol causes and halve it we would be able to increase EVERY nurse's Salary by 6 grand a year. This just an attempt to do the same by mainly hitting the lowest end alcohol. 

So let's look at an example. Special brew is £7.30 for a four pack in Tesco Online. New rules are £0.5 x 4 units (per can) which is £8 totally. An increase to £8 for a four-pack. Most of the real ale stuff would stay the same. As would pretty much anything that's a pound a can.

Or you might have an elderly person who has recovered from their fall, but needs a bed in a care home. Which means funding needs to be sorted out, social services need to be informed again, and all the admin needs to be done before they can be discharged. But again, this involves contacting a load of people/services who are only open 9-5 Monday to Friday, so if your patient is fit on Saturday then there's not much chance of them getting out then!

Corbyn is a more down to Earth character, unlike Miliband who people had trouble connecting with. Why do we need 2% spending on defence? If you ask me, spending money on defence just to keep soldiers employed is just outright stupid. There is no reason that we would need that sort of spending. As for nuclear disarmament, I doubt it's a huge issue on the UKIP voter's mind. Many voters left to UKIP just because Farage appealed to them as someone who cares for the working class. Those are the people we need to win back, and Corbyn is the only candidate who I believe can do it.

&gt; Not... Really. I advise you to read up on a planned economy. Having some things that are publicly-owned does not a planned economy make.

Publicly owned and financially regulated, so I think it counts. We also have a planned economy-lite in place with the CMA.

I'm comparing them to having a national media, particularly news, which aims to be unbiased and is not skewed towards corporate Murdoch-ish interests, and a broadcaster which isn't afraid to put on sophisticated programming that may not be commercially viable but is still worthy of being broadcast.

I get that that's not your opinion of the BBC, and its not even my opinion of all of it. I actually would not object to splitting the BBC into commercial and non-commercial organisations or switching to a channel 4 model of a public broadcaster funded by adverts.

What I don't think is justified is to (a) lose the public service broadcaster altogether just because it isn't a life-&amp;-death service, or (b) continue with a flat and regressive license fee when we consider taxes based on ability to pay as the best means to fund all other public services.

Also, you seem to have completely misread my comment regarding school meals. I specifically mentioned parents who *can* afford to feed their own kids (maybe I'm out of date, but last I heard, the school meals were available to all primary school kids without means testing). Said parents may well be wealthier than I am, but note I'm not objecting to paying for this, merely using it as an example of a service I get nothing out of, as the BBC is to you.

My biggest worry is that in the CAM role Barkley and Osman looked kind of lost positionally when Pienaar or Naismith for instance would pick up the ball and move through that center area, so it's clearly a tactic that'll take some getting used to. But I agree with the spirit of the idea, that we need to mix things up and add some chaos to the attack to pull defenses and create space.

  People here seem to be obsessed with the idea of a starting team and a bench as if this is basketball. Football teams are all about rotation. While we will have one or two ""best"" starting elevens, we will not have a usual one, as anyone who's watched football recently should have noticed. Players need rest and are rotated in and out of the line-up accordingly. This is why we need depth. It's not a case of having a strong ""back-up"" in case a particular player gets injured. It's about having, ideally at least 22 players who are all good enough to start a game whenever called upon. Fortunately, we seem to have that.

  When we utilise wingers (which is often) we play two at once. These will be selected out of Ibe, Markovic, Ings, Origi, Firmino and Lallana. Remember that Origi is also a striker, Firmino can and will play any attacking role, and Lallana plays across the AM line, and that leaves us with three players whose primary position is as a winger. It also means that, on occasions, three out of these six will play.

  Then bear in mind that, even if we fail to win anything, we'll almost certainly be playing over 50 games next season (closer to 70 if we have decent cup runs). Players will be subbed on and off each game. Players will be rested, line-ups will change on a game by game basis. We know full well that Lallana only lasts about 60 minutes. We will undoubtedly suffer injuries. This is why we have depth.

  Moreover, we have a good crop of attacking players who will push each other forwards. I would much rather have Ibe at Melwood only playing 18 games but still working with the manager and the team on a weekly basis than I'd have him at Sunderland playing in a different system where he's actively not being developed by Liverpool.

  We have assembled the squad we have so we can compete. Ibe, Markovic and Origi are first team players. We will only be doing ourselves a disservice if we send our first team players away on loan. And what makes you think any of these players *want* to go on loan? What message does that send to them, that we would rather be caught short staffed than have them as an option? 

 None of them need to go anywhere. They will all get adequate game time, and they will all be competing for places. Some will play more than others, but this is football. The idea seems to be  that we somehow have too many good players, and thus need to get rid of some, which is flat out crazy.

We've got bored, uncontrollable kids on both sides who don't see the point in education cos the job market is dire here. Our political system is a joke with tribal voting hindering it so why even bother voting. The old problems and prejudices are still being passed down and encouraged to some degree by older folks still hung up on the troubles. Housing and communities are still separated into us and them with flegs still being used as territorial markers. Schools are generally still separated.   Kids grow up seeing riots and bomb scares as just a part of daily life. It's a totally normal thing to just dander past a riot or bomb and think nothing of it.

We've still got people growing up and even adults who have either only ever been on the falls road or the shankill road, never been to both because of that old niggling fear in the back of peoples heads that you'll get beaten for walking the wrong direction though that's generally a thing of the past.


I would argue that the problems faced by loyalist youths are just a youth problem in general for Belfast.  We can't keeping raising generations and allowing this fear and separation from the Orange/Green bogey man on the other side of the wall.  Until the divide is addressed with a fresh generation any small or current issues will snowball with the old issues.

As far as Ibe. I think he absolutely should be loaned out at least until January if another PL club can offer him first team football. He's only been as hyped as he has because of the Sterling situation. It would probably benefit him to spend some time away from the media circus of Liverpool. How many matches will he come on to people saying, ""This lad has been touted as being better than the departing Sterling"". 

If he's off at a cellar dweller, I think he won't be forced to handle that same sort of pressure.

You're right, if you have the persuasion skills of a tomato then you could use that approach. Or it could go something like this:

""Good morning. I'm from Labour and I just wanted to ask you where you stand on nuclear disarmament"" 

""We should keep nukes"" 

""Ok, hopefully you're aware that they're costing us £X a year and disarmament will save us enormous amounts of money in the long run. Considering the the USA and other European countries also have nukes and will be willing to defend us, does it make financial sense to keep them?""

You chose a pretty bad example of BBC wastage by using BBC Food - it's probably one of the best resources for recipes around and the first place I go to when looking for ideas for dinner.

I can remember the images of Bobby Storey and Gerry Kelly getting laughed at and told to 'Fuck off &amp; Motor on' by some nationalist rioters at the Ardoyne shops a few years back when they tried to curb it. To be fair it never intimidated or deterred them from continuing to try and halt the rioters.

On a slightly different note, no the rioting is not good, the girl getting knocked down is awful but on the grand scale of things it's been minimal this year and somewhat blew out of proportion...In my opinion.

Yes that's right. Instead of being able to claim expenses for certain things, MPs are now expected to pay out of pocket themselves. By increasing their salary somewhat to make up for the withdrawal of certain expenses, a thick line is drawn under the expenses scandal going forward.

&gt;no.. they got caught cheating.

Some MPs were caught abusing expenses, and rationalising and updating what can and cannot be claimed is an attempt to resolve this issue. Of all the claims that made it to the press, I recall only a select few being outright illegal - the rest were exaggerations that pushed the line and took the piss on the proviso that ""that's how it's always been"". With fewer expenses, there's fewer chances for 'misunderstandings'.

&gt;And to top if off we don't even expect this to be their only job.

OK?

&gt;a taxable salary?! like the rest of us.

No one pays tax on genuine workplace expenses.

MPs aren't getting a pay rise so much as they are just having their compensation package simplified. Yesterday they might have received a car, or a car allowance - today they simply get £10,000 in their salary and Parliament can wash its hands of being responsible for deciding if they get BMWs or Fords (except cars has never really come into it).

25% of the people want unilateral nuclear disarmament. Labour ran on this platform before and lost hugely. There, refuted. I didn't bother before because it's so obvious as to be self-evident.

I find it absolutely jawdropping that think people only oppose nuclear disarmament because they're ignorant of how much it costs and under the impression that the US wouldn't defend us. It is simply impossible that you are suggesting that people are so breathtaking stupid as to not realise that nuclear weaponry costs money and that Britain is allied with the US.

But what we are discussing here is not my personal opinions, nor yours, nor even the public's. We are discussing what will help the Labour Party win.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"This seems like a good example of the issues they will face if they try to roll out consultant services to the weekend. Because, although they make their business case on the safety data - we all know deep down they are not interested in preventing a small number of deaths, but rather in boosting capacity and efficiency. What they will really want to see are elective lists and outpatient clinics running on weekends (or at the least on Saturdays). Bottlenecks like the availability of MRI will cause problems. At the moment it's okay because it's only used out of hours in emergencies, and of course as you know there are really very few ""emergencies"" that require or benefit from MRI. 

But if they want to start rolling out routine weekday services to weekends (which of course is what they want) then the definition of ""urgent"" out of hours is going to shift dramatically. Things like that MRI knee you wouldn't dream of doing on a Saturday might become more important if the orthopods are prepared to take an elective patient to theatre that day on the basis of the result (in essence like a weekday). Radiology will need to move away from a concept of providing routine services till 5pm, then emergencies only at weekends. I suspect they'll need to see a shift to at least 12 hour/6 day a week provision of core services. How is that going to then be reported, is an MSK radiologist going to be on site every day... it all gets very complicated.

It will cause all sorts of small and yet debilitating problems across a lot of service specialties and support services. How on earth for example are the path lab going to cope when they start getting weird and wonderful immunoglobulin tests on saturdays from Rheum outpatients. The blood bank staff will need a big boost when theatres are churning out cases on saturday and sunday - together with the whole blood supply chain.

Also, of course solar panels produce a lot less in the winter, maybe something like a third or a quarter of what they do in the summer. So as they say in the article you are going to have to use other sources of electricity at that time.

Look at Chelsea this season then, they had Terry, Ivanovic, Hazard, Matic, Cahill, Fabregas and Courtois. In the Prem those 7 players only missed a total of 1928 minutes COMBINED, on average that's 275 minutes each which is just over 3 full games. Those players also played an extremely high % of the CL minutes available.  

or how about Neymar, Messi and Suarez this season just gone. From the 1st of January I'm pretty sure those 3 missed under 300 minutes of football combined, they played something like 30 games total from 1st of January until the end of the season.

No club rotates just to play other players, it's to keep players fresh. But it's 2015 now, most top players can get through a season with a game off once every few weeks. We have a pretty young squad who'll mostly be in the peak of their life fitness wise, most of them should have no issues playing 6 games a month.

If Coutinho, Firmino and Henderson are fit and in OK form, they're going to be picked, it doesn't matter if Ibe or someone else needs game time. A good manager will pick the best team available no matter what, he wont give a shit if Ibe or Markovic needs game time. 

You and a few others are acting as if managers rotate key players every other game, that doesn't happen... and if it does it's due to that player having issues with their fitness or they're near the end of their career. We really don't have many players like that whatsoever.

We went into last season with about 6/7 less players and we didn't really have many fitness problems apart from Sterling getting burnt out, but that could have been fixed with 1 extra player in the squad.. not 6/7.",null,1,null,1437057834,null,0,false,0,ct5drjj,null,t3_3di4qg,null,t1_ct5drjj,null,t1_ct5cb8n,null,null,null,1437902692,null,-2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-2,null

In a missive addressed to Greater Anglia, the anonymous passenger bemoans the fact the refund was not possible because he did not apply within the requisite 28 days. 
Enclosing the rejection letter, which the complainant has ""taken the liberty of rolling up very tightly"", he advises the customer services contact to ""stick it up your arse"".

Cyclists can, and should, place themselves in a dominant road position. Your job is to give them room, acknowledge that they're vulnerable and to wait for a safe space to overtake. 

If you can see the cockwomble in the audi about to be a dick, then you need to plan for that; slow down to reduce closing speed and to increase distance. If you can't see him, why use hypotheticals? 

Equally, one man's 'unsafe overtake' is another man's 'I've got a bootfull of power and plenty of visibility'. If you look at Roadcraft and how overtakes should be done, they can look horrifically aggressive - you go from a long follow into a preparatory position close up to the vehicle in front, and then fully out into to the offside to see what's coming and what's in front of the overtake, and then you commit. 

If the cyclist sits to the nearside, he's not going to be seen when Mr Cockwomble comes out to see what's going on, and he's certainly not going to be seen during the follow. If he sits in the dominant position, he's visible through the windscreens up front and when the overtake is prepared.",null,0,null,1437058905,null,0,false,0,ct5efr6,null,t3_3dhhet,null,t1_ct5efr6,null,t1_ct5d3ui,null,null,null,1437903097,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I think Rodgers is a great training manager and can get the most out of his players on the training ground.  This is the reason that I think so many of the players who are hardworking praise him so much.  I think he composes himself really well in the locker room and on the pitch, but he definitely talks too much to the press.  He should not be saying anything about contracts or players attitudes and what not in the press.  That should all be dealt with internally.  He also has a tendency to be reluctant to change his tactics to his players and if they aren't working.  Instead of figuring out how to fix the flaws in the system he just plays players out of position or totally changes the system without really addressing some of the reasons the tactics he was using wasn't working, especially on the defensive end.  I don't think Rodgers is relying on his coaching staff for input as much as he should either.

Basically I think Rodgers is a great improver of talent and can get the most out of players who are willing to work.  This is why so many players give him praise.  Tactically and dealing with the press he needs improvement which hopefully will come with more experience.

Here, consider this article from Wings over Scotland (not exactly renowned for their hostility to the SNP's cause), on the tendering of ferry services: http://wingsoverscotland.com/the-truth-about-calmac-short-version/

In short, when Labour put the ferry services out to tender in 2005, the SNP (and SSP and Greens) screamed and hollered about how this was Tory-style privatisation being done by Labour.

Now, in 2015, when the SNP are the ones in power and doing the tendering... it's Labour (and the unions - see eg ""[CalMac Ferry workers strike against SNP privatisation](http://www.workersliberty.org/node/25326)"") hooting about Tory-style privatisation being done by the SNP.

£74k is a lot of money, but definitely an amount that many, but admittedly not all, MPs could exceed in the private sector. In my opinion MPs are driven and successful people (they managed to become an MP after all in the ultimate competitive market - open to all, voted on in selection committee and then by the public) and they are likely to be pretty successful in whatever career they choose (don't take this to mean I think they are nice people). For the most part they also have a stressful job and unsocial hours. In London £74k does not equate to that success.

However the real problem is that this is known by all of them, but none have the balls to say they are worth more, or willing to deal with the embarrassment of meeting a 0 hours contract minimum wage worker and explain why they are worth 10x more per hour. 

This then results in a the sort of culture where abuses of expenses (which even recently they dared suggest they shouldn't have to prove with receipts the way the rest of us have to) or hiring close family members as their assistants and the gold plated pension and the right to take multiple external directorships or being paid to write for papers are all accepted as being their due.

I believe the solution would be to pay them each £120k . All expenses to be on the basis that they would be in the private sector (work related and justified with receipts) and no pension except what they choose to contribute themselves in private defined contribution schemes and banned from any external sources of pay and only get 25-30 days of holiday.

This would then remove all their excuses (at a relatively low cost to the country), leave them less vulnerable to lobbying and better align them with the real world in terms of the impact their legislation has (especially around pension).",null,0,null,1437059601,null,0,false,0,ct5evlm,null,t3_3dhp2k,null,t1_ct5evlm,null,t3_3dhp2k,null,null,null,1437903422,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

""Fan of Atlético here.

Reason he is leaving is due to a contractual dispute with Atlético.. his father (his agent) wanted a sum (wages) which Nathan is simply not worth yet.. But bc of his potential other teams were there to pay him. Atletico weren't playing him as often as his father would like and he took us to court to get Nathan out of his contract (three yrs left), which he lost.. Chelsea are acting as 'agents' in this case, he's not going to be playing for Chelsea anytime soon.. it's a way to get around the contract he's in as well as the '3rd party' ownership ban.. he's not any where near ready for europe let alone Chelsea. He was not a regular starter for us and very often played pretty poorly, but he is only 19 yrs old. Also he needs to stay in brazil or his fee goes up drastically as per his contract with Atletico. It's quite a detailed and kinda complicated issue.

For a bit more detail, basically Nathan played well in a few tournaments for the younger Brazilian national team (sub 17 and sub 20). His 'value' went up so his agent (father) wanted Atletico to pay up. Other clubs showed interest so they were using that to negotiate a new contract with Atletico. Atletico and their president are known for being very very hard negotiators and once our president believes in something it is very very difficult to change his mind. He's very cocky and very stubborn. But in this case he has a very solid point. The issue was that Nathan has yet to play well for Atletico. Out of probably about 30 or so games for us he has played well in about 3-5 of them. He shows a lot of promise in certain aspects but he's simply not good enough yet. Again, this kid is only 19 years old so that doesn't mean he won't be great. His father pretty much wanted big time contract for him or else he would take him elsewhere. I believe he had 3 years on his current contract which Atletico were very happy with just running it out or running it for at least another year before selling him. Well his father realized there was a clause in the contract that for $2 million the contract could get bought out so that's just what he did. He came up with 2 million with some investers.. BUT he was stupid and didn't realize that the 2 million is only is he were to go to another team within Brazil. For him to get sold to Europe the clause was $30 million. Nathan's father took him too court and lost. Atletico had the right to keep Nathan against his will, which knowing our president I thought he was going to do just that. But that's when Chelsea came in and helped become an ""agent"" of sort. Not sure what Chelsea's play is in all of this but I guarantee you Nathan will be loaned back out to a club in Brazil. What's kinda ironic is that the best club for him to be loaned out to is probably Atletico PR this year. We have a very weak team and he would have gotten a lot of minutes this yr in his preferred role. If he gets loaned out to one of Brazil's 'big' teams, he's gonna have just as much trouble getting into the game as he did was us the last two years, when we were pretty good.""

There's a fascinating blog post about MI5 by Adam Curtis. It alleges that for most of their history they've been full of a mix of incompetent boobs and con artists, with their greatest success being in convincing the public and government that they were doing *important work which must continue*. He further alleges that much of MI5's historical mystique and perceived competence among the general population is more an invention of talented novelists and filmmakers than anything resembling reality.   

Of course it's about their history prior to 7/7 and the massive upswing in funding and importance they were given since then...
 
[BUGGER - maybe the real state secret is that spies aren't very good at their jobs and don't know very much about the world](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/entries/3662a707-0af9-3149-963f-47bea720b460)

&gt; But the problem for MI5 was that the spy network didn't exist. The Germans did have some agents in Britain - but nothing like the 5000 that Le Queux (a novelist) had described.

&gt; When war against Germany was declared in 1914 - MI5 immediately rounded up 21 alleged German spies and proudly announced they had broken the network. But a brilliant piece of historical research by the historian Nicholas Hiley has shown that this wasn't true.

&gt; Here are his conclusions (Kell and Holt Wilson were the director and deputy directors):

&gt; ""One of the most famous successes of the British Security Service was its great spy round-up of August 1914. The event is still celebrated by MI5, but a careful study of the recently-opened records show it to be a complete fabrication - MI5 created and perpetuated this remarkable lie.

&gt; The great spy round-up of August 1914 never took place - as it was a complete fabrication designed to protect MO5(G) from the interference of politicians or bureaucrats.

&gt; The claim made next day that all but one had been arrested was false, and its constant repetition by Kell and Holt-Wilson was a lie.""

null,false,Sgtdante,null,null,null,"Firstly, I did misread your comment and thought you were talking about parents who *can't* afford school lunches. A quick Google suggests that in England and Wales gets free meals for the first 2 years and Scotland the first 3. Beyond that it's only for families on income support. 

Secondly; My counter argument is that the BBC is an entertainment company that provides nothing of inherent value to our society, and should not be paid for out of the public pocket. The only actual public service it provided was discontinued over a decade ago because of disuse. As with all entertainment services it should only be paid for by people who intend to use it. I only briefly mention kids in poverty because *You* brought up paying for schools and such. If you'd mentioned state pensions/NHS/police/prison/roads/trains etc my rebuttal would have been about those. 

If anything the straw-man is you talking as if I suggested that the BBC should be axed because it's not an ambulance. The BBC ***SHOULD*** move away from the Government and towards private ownership. It ***SHOULD*** earn it's keep from the people who use the services and the advertisers that want to promote on it like every single other TV channel and/or newspaper in our country. In fact this is about the only way to promote news that isn't heavily biased to the wants of the Government, the BBC would never be critical of the people in charge if the government decided how much funding they would get. 
Also Quickly Google [""BBC Bias""](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=biad+in+teh+bbc&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=EcinVa7jLMfD7gbF-rKwDQ#q=bbc+bias). Yes it might not be in Murdoch's Interests, but all news is biased. Just had to look at the Scottish Referendum coverage to see that. In one debate someone asked the SNP member on stage (I wanna say it was Alex but not 100%) a ""Tough question"". The BBC cut the audio and had a voice over state that he ""had no response""; In the actual debate he absolutely did have an answer, a several minute long answer... (When I get home, If I can find the video, I'll post it). Or that time a half a dozen people tossed an egg at some Labour MP, and it was reported that Scotland was Rioting at a Labour rally; Not a few weeks later there were hundreds of people marching in London that went almost completely unreported. 

Anyway, got a little off track, BBC Bias is a job for another day. My thoughts on the matter are rather than me having to pay a licence fee because I own a radio (I don't) or have a TV plugged in to the Ariel (I don't) just in case I listen to or watch something the BBC produced (I don't). If I want to read the Times I'd buy it. If I want to watch Netflix I'd pay for it. If I want to watch SKY I'd Pay for it... If I've paid the BBC for not watching their content first. The fact that they act as a gatekeeper to other paid services is something I disagree with. And the fact it's a criminal offence to not pay the BBC it's cut is genuinely offensive. If you don't pay for Netflix they stop your subscription, if you don't pay for the cinema they don't let you in, if you don't pay for the paper the newsagent tells you its not a library and kicks you out. But don't pay for the BBC, even if you don't use it, and you need to justify yourself about every 2 years or face a £1000 fine and face a day in court? Potentially face a prison sentence? That's absurd.

&gt;Look around the top of politics and it seems like a wonderful time to be a woman. Two of the four candidates for the Labour leadership are female – Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall – as are three of the five in the race for deputy: Stella Creasy, Caroline Flint and Angela Eagle. One of the three likely contenders for the next Tory leadership is a woman, Theresa May. The next leader of Scottish Labour is likely to be Kezia Dugdale, and she will find herself debating two other female leaders, Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP and the Tories’ Ruth Davidson. Half of the shadow cabinet is female, and there are seven women in the cabinet. The most powerful politician in the European Union and perhaps the world is Angela Merkel.

&gt;But these eye-catching facts conceal an uncomfortable truth: remarkably high proportions of the most successful women in politics are childless. (All the named politicians above are, except Cooper and Flint.)

Why is IPSA different from a *child abuse investigation*?

I don't think that was particularly the aim, more that you shouldn't have people setting their own pay.

&gt; trust in mp's has everything to do with it becouse I don't doubt for a second that IPSA has been contacted by mp's with their views, even though their supposed to be ""independent"".

I still don't get why that would change the analysis. What part of their analysis do you think is wrong?

A cyclist (who could as easily have a child on the back, if you want to compare apples with apples) is horrifically vulnerable by comparison. I've seen my share of collisions, and none of them are pretty, but cyclist vs car is generally pretty nasty.

Your issue appears to be that a cyclist will hold up traffic and won't necessarily pull over, which ignores the obvious point that it is far easier to pass a cyclist than a caravan or a tractor, even if they've adopted a dominant position because 

* you can see past them
* they're travelling at a speed significantly slower than any motor vehicle
* they're shorter and slimmer than any other vehicle

With a bit of planning (and recalling that you can pass a cyclist on a solid white line), the traffic can pass them without them needing to pull over. 


&gt;Everyone should have more courtesy and more awareness on the roads.

That goes without saying, but I cycle, drive and motorbike and I've seen the gamut of poor driving skill and behaviour.

Last season had some intriguing occult stuff, at least one really unique protagonist, a great sense of location (maybe it's never having been to the arse end of America, but that location just felt threatening), and this season it's just another LA crime drama for the most part.  My hope is that one or two of the main characters gets bumped off because there are too many and I don't like half of them, and that there's some sort of meta-plot that links the events of season one to this season.

So me asking you to have a source over some ridiculous claim is somehow the problem here? You have to have evidence to support your claim. I don't have to unprove something you have zero proof of. It's your job to give reliable reasons to why its true. What the fuck does Mata have to do with anything? Deflection at its finest.

&gt;There's a type of people who think you are skeptic because you shout source everywhere. And then there are ostriches who put their head in the sand as if that's where they live. Guess who got smacked down the day Mata got sold.

Once again why are we talking about Mata? There was actually reliable sources in that situation and everyone knew he wasn't happy on the bench. There was plenty of evidence he was leaving. 

&gt;Reasonable skepticism this is not. Moses was having the season of his career and there's a reason he would not want to come back to sit on Chelsea's bench. Of course, then the injury happened.

But do you have any evidence Mourinho tried to bring him back? That's the claim here. 

&gt;You decide whether you want to be the ostrich or the reasonable skeptic.

Do you really believe these are the only two options? So once again do you have any reliable sources on this claim? Or are you just going to keep deflecting?

The risk is purely ours, Benteke will take Rodgers' spending to 300mn, I believe that even though we passed we were being monitored for FFP and continued lack of CL would only make our financial situation worse. I don't think we can keep spending like this every summer.

Furthermore the club's got another problem. Notice the empty seats yesterday? No Gerrard, no Suarez, no Sterling. Where's the star power? i'm a firm believer that it's not important in footballing terms, but it is for our international brand and following, if you're not going to win trophies consistently, you do need to have star players.

Not liability but because one is a commercial activity and the other isn't. Commercial mortgages tend to follow the LIBOR rate, not the BoE rate and tend to have higher interest rates.

Fairly trivial to find out just by doing credit searches. Someone who is renting and has registered on the electoral roll at your address will appear as living at your address.

I think this post addresses most of the questions you've put forth regarding Benteke as a player. 

As far as Rodger's career is concerned, that's up to FSG. Yes, Benteke is a ""gamble"" for lack of a better word, but who wouldn't be that we could acquire? Let's entertain the possibility of Lacazette coming here, higher price tag for a player who had one accomplished season in Ligue 1? Reus? Whom everyone salivates over but conveniently disregards the fact that his fitness levels are sandwiched somewhere between Sturridge and Benteke.

All this skepticism and wariness with no viable alternatives to suggest is really starting to piss me off. ""Yeah I don't like your decision but I don't have anything better to suggest!""

Bored teenager? Have you forgotten what this thread is about? A reminder, it's penny poor adults that have been taken to court and fined for not being able to afford a TV licence. A suggestion was made that there is no need to have a TV because the world is full of wonders and I pointed out, not everyone has the same options as the poster that made that claim.

&gt;If only there was a way one could search for nearby, interesting things.

You mean like the internet? The free internet.. oh wait, the internet isn't free is it? Perhaps people who can't afford to pay for a TV licence also can't afford to pay for internet? And what if, like one of the woman in the Guardian article, you are illiterate?

Right now the only way to access the net in my town if you are poor is via the library that's about to close. Any other bright ideas to how people living in poverty might share your (and mine) privileged options in life?

Perhaps you just don't understand what it's like to be poor, as in food bank poor, not, ""I can't afford a pint tonight"" poor? If you did, you've perhaps understand my points a lot better. 

And it's also obvious you aren't a single parent if you think filling the day is as simple as googling which activity group is in your area (which is open enough to drag a child along to on a daily basis and close enough to not have to use public transport to get there) and then what do you do in the evenings when the child is in bed?

I asked you for an example, not because I can't use google, but because I wanted you understand how difficult it is to come up with activities in your area that can compete with staying at home with a young child and a TV set. Go on, try. Not just things that will last an hour or two, but things that can be done in all weathers and seasons over the course of a whole day and evening. And remember, you can't spend anything on transport to get there, so the activities have to be close to each other (and child friendly).

Your snide comments to me must mean this is a very easy thing for you to do, so go ahead. Show me how obviously stupid I am to not have the same grasp of modern living as you. I'll even let you use google so you can cheat a bit.

Or is having a TV set a much, much easier way to fill the same time?

And since you seem to be struggling with the concept, I am not one of these poor as, like you I can afford such things as TV licences and internet access. I'm making a point on their behalf as they don't have the luxury of browsing Reddit all day.

I don't disagree with that. Which is exactly what the government has said today; *""The BBC needs to review whether it should try to be all things to all people""*. Honestly, I'm actually pretty supportive of the government position on that. I think the BBC has a limited budget and it needs to think more seriously about how to leverage that budget. 

&gt; What it sounds like you're asking for is that all bits of the BBC that you don't like are stripped out so you only have to pay for the bits you like.

Not at all. Think about it like this... why have a BBC? I mean in the 21st century there are plenty of media providers in the UK. Is there a specific need for the state to provide a media company? I would argue there is in some regards; for example BBC news is the only news website in the UK that is legally bound to be impartial. I mean thats pretty serious stuff. The Guardian is good, but when you read it you've got to remember they've got their agenda - as does the Telegraph, the Sun and the myriad of other sites. But not the BBC. We argue a lot about whether they are biased but in reality they are pretty clean by comparison to their competitors. The same can be said for the TV channel. Obviously TV news has more legal requirement for impartiality but even so it's useful for the state to have a TV company under its indirect control for all number of reasons. Radio equally falls between those ideas - there is clearly a demand for radio and without the BBC it's hard to see how rural areas in particular would get a look in.

Then we get onto things like recipes... and that's where I would draw a line. We don't need the state to be subsidizing or funding a recipe website, regardless of how good it is.

&gt; Also you couldn't use a worse example than cooking recipes online which for the price of putting it up there add tonnes of value to the cookery shows aired with little extra costs.

Have you got the cost figures to hand then? Perhaps you can educate me how much it costs?... or you can't, and that's all based on the assumption that from your perception these things are cheaper than the BBCs other operations.

null,false,gamas,,Labour Member,null,"&gt; I hope everyone who was all 'Let's have a proper leadership debate by including someone who doesn't want to be leader' is kicking themselves now.

No, I'm not kicking myself. The people voting in this election are all fully paid members and supporters of the party. If we're giving money to the party, we damn well want the party to represent our views. The members are saying they want Labour to adopt more left-wing views, so it is Labour's job (if they want us to continue giving them money) to address that concern.

Now I had hoped Jeremy's involvement would push the other three candidates into realising they need a more left wing platform (and for Yvette and Andy, that has worked to an extent as they have started taking more left-wing stances than they were before the debates), but none of them have really risen to what the party members want.

If Jeremy has shown himself to be the only candidate close enough to the views of the party members to be worth considering, then that is entirely on the other candidates for not realising who they are trying to represent, not the people who asked for Jeremy's nomination. It's not my problem if the only response by the other candidates is to engage in a ""DAE think our members are lefty commie morons"" circlejerk. If Corbyn wins and then subsequently loses the next generation election, then the party only has itself to blame for not presenting another option that had more reasonable stances whilst still being compatible with the members' views... Seriously, if one of the candidates was basically just slightly-left of Miliband whilst being 100x more charismatic, I would have been happy. I actually kinda like Andy, but I think he has the same level of charisma as Miliband, and I have difficulty believing he would be a firm opposition... he seems to cave too easily which is something that won't be good in either opposition or as prime minister.

When I joined the party, I didn't realise the party was so anti-democracy....

EDIT: If I'm honest though, the homeopathy and stuff about foreign relations are making me flaky about Corbyn, I'm torn between choosing Yvette as I believe she is the best of both worlds (in terms of presenting a centre-left platform whilst being charismatic), and choosing Corbyn because the party needs to start having some firm platform to stand on - a dodgy platform is better for a political party than no platform.",null,0,null,1437068001,null,0,1437069030,0,ct5kldy,null,t3_3dhfc1,null,t1_ct5kldy,null,t1_ct58y69,null,null,null,1437907522,null,2,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

And that if the BBC isn't what some want to some people then that's a complete rip off when they're also paying for the license fee. 

You say you can go elsewhere for other parts of the BBC and you're right you can go other places. But you have to pay for them either through advertising, subscription or purchase which costs you in some way. And so I don't think that's a good argument, because you have to pay once for your news and people who don't want to watch what you think is valuable have to pay once for your news and then again for what they want, which is totally unfair. 

It would be seen as ridiculous for the BBC news not to have a website but by your arguments I see no reason why it should have one but recipes from cooking shows being published is where we should draw the line.

My friend and I were back in high school acting like shits so we got sentenced to detention, just the two of us after school. The proctor turns out to be Jose, but I don't recognize him as a football manager, just realize that I should fear him. He takes us to a beige tiled room that has a huge sort of engine block crusher with wooden sides in it which is running. He says, ""if you want to be free again you will have to make this disappear, I don't care how."" and smiles. We think it's a joke until the first night comes and goes. Then weeks go by. We have eaten some of the wood from the sides of the machine but have mostly given up. One night when Jose comes in to give us our daily bologna and white bread sandwiches, he turns his back to me and I take my chance, delivering a thunderous headbutt to the back of his head. He crumples to the ground and we bolt out the door. We're sprinting down a pitch black hallway toward some double doors, me in front, my friend close behind. I hear the ceiling crash and my friend isn't with me anymore; I don't need to look to know he's been taken by Jose. I burst out into the parking lot and run through dim streetlights until I get to the edge of it and turn around. Off in a field to the left is Jose, wearing only his tighty-whitey underwear, walking in my direction. I look down and have a revolver in my hand, and when I look back up he is much closer, casually dangling a revolver of his own at his side, so I pull up and start shooting. Two of my shots tear through his pasty legs, so I turn and run into a huge expo type building, a glassy one kind of like what you see research corporations in in movies. There are streamers all over the ceiling and sun is shining brightly through the windows. I run and run, and come up on a group of people.

You say ""large chunks of the party, including its elected representatives, don't support"" - but if he won the leadership election then clearly those who don't support him are the minority in the party.

However, the impression I've got (and one I agree with) is that Corbyn isn't actually what the members want though, it's just the closest they are being offered. What the members actually want is an English ""Nicola Sturgeon"" - someone with a reasonable and passionate anti-austerity platform, who holds a strong and genuine passion in all aspects of what they believe in. The hope had been that Jeremy's presence would drag Yvette and Andy (we never expected to really drag Liz as she was meant to represent the other side of the debate) to that position, and whilst they have moved quite significantly towards he, they don't seem to have the passion that can really drive the Labour campaign.

...Honestly though, the homeopathy business is making me consider switching my order to make Yvette my first preference with Corbyn second just to send the message.

EDIT: And by considering I now mean after two hours of thinking, I have now definitely switched to supporting Yvette... I am a democratic socialist at heart, but I can't support someone who is willing to dismiss all evidence just for the sake of personal ideology. It's the main reason I couldn't bring myself to support the Green Party, and the reason I am now dismissing Corbyn.

EDIT2: I do think people in both the party and particularly this subreddit need to calm the fuck down about Corbyn though. Yes, he's not going to be the saviour of the party, but he's not going to be a complete disaster either. If Labour collapses as a result of his selection, it was only because everyone in the party got so caught up in panic and hysteria that they descended into large scale infighting...

Rabiot is not exactly out of favor at PSG, and it seems like his agent/mother is a bitch to deal with. Not exactly unrealistic, but sketchy. 

Mirallas is a solid enough player, but I think he'd be a bit on the expensive side for his age. Would rather give Pritchard a chance backing up Chadli, who I think is quality. 

Julian Green I have almost no interest in. He wasn't good enough to play for a lower table Bundesliga side, and didn't seem to have the most fantastic attitude while there. He's done about nothing to earn a move or playing time besides declare and play for the States.

&gt; You might be interested to know that I (Gary Streeter) received divine healing myself at a church meeting in 1983 on my right hand, which was in pain for many years. After prayer at that meeting, my hand was immediately free from pain and has been ever since. What does the ASA say about that? I would be the first to accept that prayed for people do not always get healed, but sometimes they do. That is all this sincere group of Christians in Bath are claiming.

&gt; It is interesting to note that since the traumatic collapse of the footballer Fabrice Muamba the whole nation appears to be praying for a physical healing for him. I enclose some media extracts. Are they wrong also and will you seek to intervene?

null,false,fuckedbyletters,null,null,null,"i cancelled my tv license a few months ago. i'll detail it out for you.

I do not watch any form of live television.
I do not record live television using a set top box or the internet.
For these two reasons I do not need a TV license.

When I rang them to cancel, they asked me if I do either of these things, I said I don't. I was asked if I would like to cancel my TV license for 6 or 12 months. I chose 12 months. I received a £33 refund for the period of the year that had already been paid and my license was cancelled for 12 months from the date I requested. The TV license company said they would contact me in 11 months to check I still do not need a license.

If you are worried about inspectors then remove your set top box (if you have one) and all aerial cables that would connect your TV to your aerial. You need a license to watch live television or to record shows as they are broadcast. If you can demonstrate to an inspector that this is impossible for you to do then you are fine. Personally I would refuse them entry to my home but that's just me.

I have replaced live television using mainly YouTube and Netflix. You can also use BBC iPlayer (just don't watch live broadcasts), All4 and any other streaming service you can think of. These can be streamed to your TV without needing a TV license. There is a wealth of readily accessible content on the internet that you do not need a license to access.

He's also a good age and will probably replace Jags when he retires for a season or two probably. I can't really see negatives to this honestly except for the price but he's relatively low risk especially when we're in need of centre backs. I wouldn't worry about him benching Stones. I think the fact that we've given him number 5 and not saved it for the incoming defender that we all knew was going to come in is the biggest show of confidence that he's going to be starting.

**Arsenal brought in Shad Forsythe and things seem to have improved, but Chelsea picked up almost no injuries throughout the season and it showed. What are they doing differently? Your good friend Damian Roden has done a good job at Stoke too hasn’t he?**

*Jose Mourinho has a very deep understanding of periodization, together with his assistant Rui Faria, so that is the most important reason – the coaches have a deep understanding with periodization which is of stark contrast to other coaches. Secondly, they have a football-specific approach so they develop fitness as an integral part of football and football training. Mourinho doesn’t do any isolated training, it is all just a part of playing football, so these two reasons are the most important reasons why Mourinho and Chelsea are doing so well. They can play and train with the same XI almost every day and as a result the team can develop good communication and understanding, which only boosts your chances of winning trophies.*



**Final question; who would you say, whether it be a club, a player or a national team, is at the forefront of the game today in terms of conditioning? Who looks after themselves the best, or which club looks after their players better than others – who is the one leading the way so to speak?**

*Like I said before, Chelsea and Jose Mourinho are the benchmark in terms of football periodization. That doesn’t mean they are perfect because if you look at Diego Costa he struggled with hamstring injuries almost throughout the season. So that proves that nobody is perfect but if everybody would apply the same principles as Jose Mourinho and Chelsea then the number of injuries in football would decrease dramatically.*

I'm very work motivated and career focused - my life for the last 8 years was completely taken over by work and I enjoyed it until I was fired.


I can't just float through life in minimum wage jobs with no aspirations or goals. I want a **career** not just a job. I want something I can be passionate about that I take pride in and be successful in. I can't work in my industry again.


I have to find something new to be passionate about and strive for. My only real passions are films, but I live in an area with near enough no film making community and certainly not an area I could find a job in. Even if I could find a job in the film industry, without having an expertise or skill, I'd have to be an unpaid runner which isn't good enough as I need to earn money. The competition for becoming a runner is ridiculous.


I'm quite hands on and a creative type, I like responsibility and being in control (I was a line manager in my previous role) and have lots of decisions to make. My ideal job would be in a creative role within film.


Alternatively I'd like to work for a big company in a management position but without a good degree that sounds impossible. I don't want to spend 3 years studying for a degree (well 4 as I don't have enough A-Levels so would have to resit them) as I'll be on low or zero pay and I can't afford that. Doing a part time degree takes too long (5-6 years)!




I literally have no idea what I want to do, I know I just want something:

* Creative
* In a position of responsibility 
* Good prospects/progression 



I know I **don't** want:

* To be in a minimum wage/entry level job for the rest of my life
* To spend 3+ years studying/training (happy to consider anything that takes less than 3 years)


I would consider:

* Working in a trade like electrician/plumber/construction/painting and decorating but I've heard to be employable or be able to register with certain associations you need to have around 3-5 years experience training/learning?

Factual nitpick, but that's not true at all.

According to the CAIN database, the closest was the Red Hand Commandos, with 5 protestants, 5 catholics and 3 'not from Northern Ireland'. Killings under the name of the UDA is next up (57 catholics, 53 protestants, 3 nfni). No other loyalist group comes close, at least as far as known killings is concerned.

One possible 'out', though, is that about 250 killings are classed as unspecified Loyalist (circa 1971, 1972, there were a lot of unclaimed murders as the UDA and UVF revved up their murder campaign, but let Republicans take the rap) The victims were about 80% Catholic, so it's highly unlikely that this changes anything.

To me, it is by no means a satisfying answer. But his application of liberalism to the issue is apparent, however:

The absence of reference to a scientific evidence-based criteria for the advocacy of medical treatment seems to be quite illiberal in the potential harm it could cause. I feel that he missed the point when he wrote 'a'. Additionally, on his point 'c', it would seem odd if any political parties suggested we pray to them/offer sacrifice/or participate in other ritualistic activities in order to better our physical health. 

It also begs the question that, for such a U-turn, why he even signed it in the first place.

Certainly, it is worthy to be sceptical of those in a position of power, and Tim is no exception - he has made it quite easy in this case.

In the end, there are many qualities that make a good leader, and I think he's certainly one to watch and that his liberal principles will probably come out over his religious views.",null,0,null,1437073162,null,0,false,0,ct5o8r8,null,t3_3dij2o,null,t1_ct5o8r8,null,t1_ct5m5bl,null,null,null,1437910240,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Firstly, I chose my words carefully when I said it was the *aim* of the BBC to be unbiased, rather than saying that it *is* unbiased. It's not perfect, but its a long way better than the shameless likes of Fox News, which is not the way I want to see UK media go.

Secondly, I said specifically that I was against the license fee. This conversation we're having now began when someone else said ""Why not replace it with general taxation?"". You were opposed, I was in favour, but I did suggest alternatives as well (e.g. the Channel 4 approach for which you wouldn't have to pay a penny). 

So why is it that (after I've fended off accusations of starving children to death), you now seem to be debating the license fee at me, as if at some point I said it was a fantastic idea. I didn't - I said it was regressive. I also didn't bring up kids in poverty - I brought up kids who *aren't* in poverty. 

Seriously, is it Opposite Day, or something?

Am I the only one who's been reasonably disappointed with our transfer business so far?

I'd hope for at least 4 more players including Song, a striker and two wingers. If we're going to get a striker, i'll be very pissed off if it's not Chicarito, Remy or Austin because those are the only three we've been linked with who aren't risky.

Basically, we shouldn't be trying to get players who big teams actually want to offload, which is more or less what Everton have been doing for the past two years and, in my opinion, failed in so doing (i.e. Destro, Doumbia, Gervinho, Ogbonna). I guess Chicarito fits into that category but there's less desire to let him leave than the other ones, who are basically being offered to us.

null,false,mushroomgodmat,null,null,null,"&gt; I'd like to see a compulsive test or training for people on bicycles. Either at school as a one off lesson, when buying a bike or as a short course.

Its an idea... 

A better one would be to train motorists on how to deal with cyclists. Perhaps get them on a bike, cycle down an A road, and see how they get on. 

But generally I dont have a problem with training in schools

&gt;While bikes are relatively safe people need to understand that when they are on the road they need to to follow the highway code and understand who different roads and road vehicles work.

around 85-90% of adult cyclists already have a driving license. Most know what read lights are, and the law generally. They (for a bunch of genuine and selfish reasons) break the rules because they can, or need too. 

&gt;Lately I've seen a lot of cyclists on country roads doing 30mph+ down hill. Just takes one pothole

That's a non issue - it rarely costs lives. 

&gt;In towns or cities whether they signal correctly

signaling is interesting on a bike - this is in no way an excuse for those who cannot be bothered - but I will say that on many occasions signaling is not all that safe. For example, around roundabouts in heavy traffic. Its not recommended you start removing hands from handlebars at speed, and whist making multiple turnings. 

&gt;Anyone riding a moped (restricted at 30mph) has to do a full day of training before they are even allowed on the roads. Can't see why cyclists who can achieve and even pass 30mph should be any different.

Because I suppose the average speed of a cyclist in the UK is something like 13mph. Yes there are people out there who can hit higher numbers than that (I can hit 30ish for about a mile) but generally some random Joe on a bike has no hope of doing so.

With that in mind, I appreciate you might like the idea, but the government wont see the need, the numbers are simply too low to start training millions of people.

As for Carvalho, the injury is long-term but not so bad for recovery. Typically tibia fractures don't have long-term effects on player performance. Recovery will take a few months but he should be able to return to first team action and get right back to his best. Unlike significant Ligament or Meniscus damage which could and on some scale I believe always will affect player's abilities, broken bones recover fully. There are no significant side effects other than a weaker bone at the break site for a year or so. Of course I'm no doctor and every injury is different, but this is my understanding from research.

The guy hasn't said a single controversial thing in 5 years at City. I just think this is because we're talking about Wolfsburg and City here. And he's soon to be an ex-player of both teams (probably a done deal). Don't think it's malicious. 

Just so we're on the same page, read the full quote:
&gt; Full quote:
&amp;gt; A lot of players who excelled in other leagues have had problems here -- take Angel Di Maria. I’m certain that he (De Bruyne) has what it takes to play for one of the top clubs in Europe but he’s also aware that at these clubs there are 20 top players who always want to be on the pitch. Maybe it would also help him if he plays in the Champions League with Wolfsburg this season and takes another step in his development there. Kevin has an advantage, through his time at Chelsea he knows the Premier League and knows that it’s completely different. Top players like Kevin De Bruyne won’t stay at Wolfsburg forever. Everybody dreams of one day playing for a leading international club. It was the same with me after we won the league in 2009 -- I had the desire to do something different.

It's honestly not bad at all. He didn't say Kevin shouldn't come to City. Called City a top club in it at the same time.

Logic on my side goes something along the lines of: Alcohol imposes costs on society as a whole via its consumption, currently those costs are not bourn out by those who are doing the consuming, so taxing alcohol addresses that imbalance. A second order effect would be a reduction in alcohol consumption overall, especially among lifestyle drinkers (not binge) who are especially price sensitive, so further reduction in medical impact. May or may not have an impact on binge drinking/addiction, depends on availability of other drugs, if possible to encourage transfer to different chemical that has lower impact would be a positive but more research needed, are there possible candidates among currently restricted drugs. Alcohol consumption is not in itself a good, effects of it that are desired can be obtained elsewhere, but alcohol currently normalised, need to look into breaking link there for any other policies to have notable impact, consider part of review of other drug policy, how to make alcohol consumption less socially acceptable ala tobacco, addiction support services need to be looked at, provide other outlet that is safer then alcohol.

Ok, not super coherent, but that seems to be most of it. People drink for a specified set of reasons, but alcohol consumption imposes a number of negative effects, so push them to other outlets that are not as detrimental to themselves and society as a whole yet still satisfy those reasons. One factor that can be instantly implemented is taxation on alcohol, and while itself won't solve the problem in full does provide a stop gap measure by pushing the costs from general population onto the consumer.",null,0,null,1437077834,null,0,1437078126,0,ct5rhxm,null,t3_3dhh8j,null,t1_ct5rhxm,null,t1_ct5m39f,null,null,null,1440477070,null,-2,false,UKGreens,t5_34166,-2,null

not at all.  If there being paid something now it would be churlish and set a very dangerous precendent to cut pay for them. Simply becouse I could see them turning around and doing it to others. 

Personally I would much prefer it that they got no payrise at all until everyone in the country (i.e. the people they are supposed to represent) saw what little they get increase, including the unemployed since they are part of society no matter what some people would like. 

No, my complaint is, as it was at the very start, the timing of it. since people are being told they have to have cuts due to ""austerity"" then it seems like a slap in the face for the politicians who are not well liked or trusted by some to be given what some people would consider a huge payrise.",null,0,null,1437078114,null,0,false,0,ct5rp5w,null,t3_3dhp2k,null,t1_ct5rp5w,null,t1_ct5mkpk,null,null,null,1440477067,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

An assertion of their core values should be a priority. That means their stance on taxation, the NHS, Europe, the free market - everything needs to be spelled out because I'm afraid saying ""Tim Farron is an excellent communicator"" means nothing to me as a voter. Modern-day politics seems to be a general overview, like a CV for a job. If we could hear some serious stances on the issues that we're facing I'd be very happy to re-accept the liberal democrats as a serious party and I'd welcome another voice in the political discourse.

Say whatever you feel about UKIP and the SNP, but they're both presenting strong statements of intent and I'm sure the integrity of at least the SNP will stand up to scrutiny (less so UKIP because they insist they're don't attract racist voters. They do.) Having a strong Lib Dem voice should be a priority and I deeply care about what they have to say.

It's a decent chunk of our transfer budget, I'd be surprised if we spent that much on another player this window if we get him. I just don't think we can afford to waste so much money on someone who's been very poor for over two years, only has one good season on his CV, is 27, forced to 6th choice centre back at United behind two teenagers and a left back, and only has one year left on his contract. It's been a long time since he was good enough for Fergie, players can peak early, decline fast, or never live up to potential. He would not be playing for United now if Fergie was still in charge. I reckon he has more mistakes in him than Alcaraz and that's saying something. Plus, he seems like a bit of a dick. If he was at any club other than United he'd seem like a very dodgy signing. 

Again, I hope I'm wrong, there is a chance he could turn out to be moderately reliable back up, but I think we need to be aiming higher if we're spending £8m of our limited budget. If it's so little why didn't we offer the full £12m for Dann, a considerably better player, or even the £8-9m for Klavan who's better than him all day long.",null,0,null,1437079025,null,0,false,0,ct5sdip,null,t3_3dj1a7,null,t1_ct5sdip,null,t1_ct5rkxj,null,null,null,1437913371,null,7,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,7,null

Labour stating that they will not oppose the child tax credit cuts is what made me, as a potential Labour supporter, absolutely sure in my disdain for the supposed ""party of the working people"".

They would be hard to pull off but I think, maybe with the exception of Verratti, that we could get these for £20m-£30m less than Pogba, and with that extra money we could look at another midfielder as well, probably a home-grown one like Barkley or Ward-Prowse.

null,false,MattyMurdock2015,null,null,null,"The GAA is not ""for everyone"". I'm 31 years old, and played football for a club in Antrim. Reserves for Christs sake, so I'm nowhere near your level. But I did love it. So much. My grandfather founded my club and I was damn proud to pull on the jersey, coach kids, whatever. But I got married and moved to county derry, a prominent club here. My reserve matches were mostly in belfast,so I would work, and instead of going home to my wife, I'd nip home to my parents house, grab a bite to eat, and train. Or head to a game in Belfast. Some nights getting in around midnight. If I had a game on a Saturday I would use up annual leave as I have to work every second saturday.

Ultimately it was too much and I fell out of love with the GAA. 6 years later I'm now getting back into it, mostly due the fact the club where I live IS the community, and its great. It makes me feel welcome again.

But my point is, even if I had the talent, I dont have the job (going for a random example as my mate works for the same company - Sean Cavanagh.) that supports my career the way CavanaghKelly supports Sean Cavanagh. He can come and go as he pleases.I had to fundraise for every bit of kit I ever got or buy it myself - not that I minded but nothing was handed to me.

The bottom line is, if you're at the top, you're rewarded with gear, sponserships and eleusive medals. If your not at the top, you're giving up a hell of a lot of your life just to play football.

I'll watch the GAA all day now, I'll take my son to the games and help out at my new club. But I know now in my heart of hearts, my one hour of 5 a sides a week, where I meet my mates, get some excercise, have some craic and then go home to my family, gives me much more enjoyment than kitting out for my club ever would.",null,0,null,1437080718,null,0,false,0,ct5tlio,null,t3_3dee9x,null,t1_ct5tlio,null,t3_3dee9x,null,null,null,1437914237,null,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2,null

""Authoritarianism is a form of government. Juan Linz, whose 1964 description of authoritarianism is influential,[1] characterised authoritarian regimes as political systems by four qualities: (1) ""limited, not responsible, political pluralism""; that is, constraints on political institutions and groups (such as legislatures, political parties and interest groups), (2) a basis for legitimacy based on emotion, especially the identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat ""easily recognizable societal problems"" such as underdevelopment or insurgency; (3) neither ""intensive nor extensive political mobilization"" and constraints on the mass public (such as repressive tactics against opponents and a prohibition of anti-regime activity) and (4) ""formally ill-defined"" executive power, often shifting or vague""

That was quickly copy and pasted, now i'm struggling to understand here, how the labour party or those to their left are ascribing to authoritarianism. 

Authoritarianism is irrelevant to the 'lefties' or 'righties' and its impossible to say they're one side or the other. Saying the labour movement is authoritarian, is more wrong than calling Thatcher authoritarian, you know, the woman who restricted the movement and activities of the labour movement, whilst allowing more activity to those who agreed with her philosophies.

My point is not that Thatcher is authoritarian, and neither is Labour, i'm saying that calling the left wing political sphere authoritarian is just as accurate as saying i am 12 lightyears old. Now it might sound correct, except the measurement (authoritarianism) you're applying to the subject, is on the wrong 'scale'.

The 11th night isn't going anywhere. It is becoming better managed - remember not so long ago we had paramilitary shows of strength, shots fired, and fire brigade callouts almost every minute around midnight.

Obviously reading the crap posted here you'd be forgiven for thinking WWIII was just around the corner - don't use echo chambers when gauging progress.

&gt;Fair play to the uup this year, they were actually trying as the shit was going on. 

As I said, far better than irate alliance bystanders shouting loudly at arms length. So about this lack of leadership you accuse unionist politicians of...

&gt;The site is going to be turned into a play park, so hopefully this site won't be an issue next year. 

Rodgers had the sense to stress all relevant participants will be consulted, declaring it a done deal isn't helpful.

&gt;Forgive me if I'm concerned with people getting hurt or killed, and want the celebrations to be safe and lacking antisocial elements. 

Except that nobody ever does, which is remarkable for any night time event of it's scale I'd imagine. And you never answered me when I asked if you ever attended a bonfire - and if you haven't well you can forgive me for being sceptical each time I hear this 'concern' - to a bonfire attender it just sounds like sourness.

&gt;Alliance are hardly on the sidelines on this, having pushed for beacons and the funding scheme. 

'Pushed'? Is that code for more calls? Talking to the bonfire organisers via the medium of the papers and snappy twitter one liners? Realistically Alliance is toxic in the streets bonfires are lit. 

&gt;as opposed to letting the thugs increasingly run the show as the DUP have so far been seemingly reluctant to tackle in any real way.

But they aren't are they? Less incidents = more well managed bonfires. Got to laugh at your fear mongering attitude - isn't that what alliance says it isn't? You're relying on a the rise of thugs to be critical of the DUP. Except your wrong.

I didn't like the much publicised incidents this year, and was the first to say so. I've made my views known to various political &amp; community leaders and I hope they increase their efforts to educate and reform attitudes.

At Fiorentina Ljajic and Stevan Jovetic linked up very well which earned them both big moves. 
Ljajic and Tadic of Southampton are similar players in the sense that both are very technically gifted and good dribblers.

Benteke and Pedro have combined release clauses (if the media are to be believed) £65.5m, which we could easily cover with the enhanced revenues and sponsorship deals we've acquired over the last two seasons. 

If i'm not mistaken the new stadium renovation costs don't factor into FFP, and the huge old stadium design debts run up by H&amp;G have been written off under FFP ruling, so they won't be held against us in the future.

You're right though about the rest - there is no leadership, and no one sensible enough to listen to.

I'd gladly attend a bonfire, same way I've attended orange parades, despite not coming from that community. At the moment though, a certain party made people like me a target for violent attack via a leafleting campaign, and these bonfires seem to have paramilitary backing so for my own safety, I cannot. None of my unionist friends attend due to the perception of anti social behaviour either, so I can't tag along there. Some day, hopefully.

As for alliance being toxic in those streets, I think the election results said otherwise - increase in votes. Every door was wrapped by an Alliance volunteer and my understanding is there was a surprising level of support in unexpected areas. Encouraging going forward.

He can stick around and fill in as Jags gets older while we wait for the younger guys to get up to speed. 

The clear issues are the injuries, and the lack of leadership. Injuries are always a gamble. The leadership is the bigger concern IMO, but that would really depend on how well Stones steps up this year. It has been thrown around a lot that Evans is fantastic when he isn't the main guy. I think coming in as a rotation for Stones he would do fine as Jagielka is a strong leader, but depending on how well Stones can lead the line would effect how well they could tandem together.

£32m relatively speaking isn't a huge sum in the transfer market in the current climate. Back when we signed Carroll the fee was a big deal in that time period.

Nowadays, players go for similar fees and higher all the time, its vastly inflated, competitive market - more than ever and will continue to be.

Benteke is a better player all round than Carroll. He will be under pressure as much as anyone else at this club or any other club. Although going off his record at Villa which is more or less 1 in 2 goals, I think he'll be just fine. He'll be in a better team surrounded by better players feeding him.

Coutinho, Firmino, Milner, Henderson, Markovic, Ibe, Lallana, Ings, Sturridge are all capable of feeding him.

Exciting times.

Firstly they reviewed their locations and recognised that stations and airports (areas with high footfall) were prime locations along with some high street stores. They then assessed the cost basis of each store and to cut a long story short identified myriad stores that needed to go immediately and others that will go when their leases come up. Largely the ones that are going are high street and the ones that will remain are airports and such. They are essentially embracing the books to read on the train/holiday, travel essentials you may have forgotten, snacks, cigarettes and newspaper angle. Those massive bargain basement Smiths are slowly being phased out, and in many ways replaced by the works (seriously, who shops in there?).

It was very easy for me to immigrate here, though the system changed at the start of 2015 (it's now more difficult). I used a couple of year long working holiday visas (for 18-30 year olds) to get one year of Canadian work experience. That was all i needed to qualify for permanent residency.

I love living near the Rockies; it allows me to spend my free time biking, hiking, rafting, kayaking or snowboarding depending on the season. I don't believe there's a place in the UK that I could have such easy access to such an extensive area to explore.

The wildlife here is amazing, probably seen as many as 20-30 bears in the wild since arriving, as well as eagles, elk, bison, beavers and plenty of other things.

I miss some food from home, but can find most things here. The pub/bar scene here is pretty crap. The stereotypical view of Canadian's being super nice is true, but it's hard to distinguish between niceties and people smiling and lying to you - I appreciate the most honest nature people have in the UK. I don't miss how seemingly chavvy the UK has become.

I dislike how little pride people back home can have in their home. Amazed me how many dog shits I had to step over last time I was in Cardiff (one of my favourite places back home). Calgary is fantastically clean in comparison.

I miss the travel options you have from the UK - huge number of places you get visit within a 2-3 hours of flying. I have very few options from Calgary, it's the US, or flying much further down to Mexico, the Caribbean or Iceland.

I advise you to call the airline and to ask what their policy is on damaged passports. My assumption is that they will ask you to bring another form of photo_ID such as a driver's licence if the photo in your passport is damaged. 

Don't just hope to get through because you may easily be the person who is spot-checked that day. 

When you're in Portugal check with both border control and the airline about their return flight policies as these may be more stringent than outgoing flights.

Soares,

null,false,Kubrickhammer,null,null,null,"not what i said though, it's not actually that hard to buy automatic first-team players when you look at who played in our first-team last year.

i keep looking to Hull last year, got into Europe and just spent lots of money on bulking up the squad with mostly rejects such as Ramirez, Dawson and Ben Arfa. Southampton on the other hand reinvested their cash on perhaps less well-known players who had proven themselves in other European leagues (well the Erdeversie basically!) like Tadic and Pelle. i guess we're somewhere in between with our signings so far. honestly, it's just that Payet is the only one who excites me. Put it this way, last year our two best signings were a first team player for the best team in Belgium and the best LB in the Championship. Even if they were risky themselves based on league quality they arrived from (similar to Dutch league signings for Southampton) I'd rather be taking those risks where the player in question doesn't really feel he has to prove he's not past it or that he's actually good enough for Juventus, Roma or Arsenal (Gervinho). Why should we be giving so many players second chances? Zarate fits into this as well, same with Downing and Carroll ultimately, both of whom have largely done nothing to change common perceptions of their quality.

it is unquestionably going to be our biggest season, not necessarily our most important, but when else will not getting relegated matter so much?

Ogbonna, Obiang and Payet (so...our signings basically, I'm talking shit therefore) basically fit into the calibre of player i think we should be after, though the former for a bit more cash than i would have hoped. I don't think we'll quite go down but i'm amazed that more people aren't as worried as i am. It's more the striker and forward chase that's been worrying me.

though being someone who is easy to please, the sigining of Chicarito would immediately reassure me. there's no way a team with fucking Chicarito is going down.",null,0,null,1437086461,null,0,1437087814,0,ct5x8lj,null,t3_3ditdt,null,t1_ct5x8lj,null,t1_ct5tdfp,null,null,null,1437916869,null,1,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,1,null

I'd say on balance it was more stable than previous years, Chobham St was an unwelcome exception.

&gt;By pushed, I mean working within the councils to get these schemes going. Good leadership. Makes things better. :)

No one political party can take credit for something that came from the voluntary sector. When it comes down to it, representations to loyalist bonfire builders are made by loyalist politicians.

&gt;I'd gladly attend a bonfire, same way I've attended orange parades, despite not coming from that community. At the moment though, a certain party made people like me a target for violent attack via a leafleting campaign, 

Are you saying had those leaflets not went out and you proceeded with the big alliance flag idea you wouldn't be in the same situation re loyalists &amp; having your election posters burned, etc?

&gt;and these bonfires seem to have paramilitary backing so for my own safety, I cannot.

This is the crux of the matter. How can you claim to affect change with people you do not have a working, or even safe, relationship with? How can you criticise unionist politicians when if it was left up to your party there would simply be a vacuum?

&gt;As for alliance being toxic in those streets, I think the election results said otherwise - increase in votes. 

In the upper sections of these roads maybe the attack loyalist strategy got votes, but you're kidding yourself if you think the unrest that characterised alliance's term in east Belfast was rewarded in the communities where bonfires are lit.

&gt;I'm not going to pretend APNI aren't toxic to a particular group, but they're small in number, really. And they'd never vote alliance regardless.

That's not what I'm getting at. Quit electioneering on this sub for just a second - I'm looking at your record as a self-styled middle of the road party and saying one large section of the divide in NI doesn't trust you. How are you able to claim balance in that sense? How can you be trusted with good management of the city when you got it so wrong in the past?

You don't really mind of course, because the fact is you use this 'battle' with loyalists to seek middle class votes in the neighbouring wards. Elsewhere your presence is anemic.

In general this one sided policy alliance pursues is having a net destabilising effect on NI.

&gt;In an interview with Michael Parkinson broadcast on ITV1 on 4 March 2006, Blair referred to the role of his Christian faith in his decision to go to war in Iraq, stating that he had prayed about the issue, and saying that God would judge him for his decision: ""I think if you have faith about these things, you realise that judgement is made by other people ... and if you believe in God, it's made by God as well.""[201] According to Alastair Campbell's diary, Blair often read the Bible before taking any important decisions. He states that Blair had a ""wobble"" and considered changing his mind on the eve of the bombing of Iraq in 1998.

&gt;At a Q&amp;A in August 2013 Cameron described himself as a practising Christian and an active member of the Church of England.[300] On religious faith in general he has said: ""I do think that organised religion can get things wrong but the Church of England and the other churches do play a very important role in society.""[301] He says he considers the Bible ""a sort of handy guide"" on morality.[302] He views Britain as a ""Christian country"" and aims to put faith back into politics.
