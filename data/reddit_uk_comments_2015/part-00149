null,false,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,null,"Interesting on Lamela.  I think your point about him playing the game ""faster"" than his teammates is a bit misplaced though... I feel like he is definitely expecting a bit more from them than what they are currently offering (and rightly so... we are still far too stagnant in attack), but his playing of balls regardless of whether they're there to be played or not smacks of poor situational awareness.

The thing is, not every pass needs to be a Hollywood ball.  The vast majority of possession should be simple balls to feet, preferably played with a minimum of touches, unless you being on the ball is actually a) moving into space past opponents, or b) creating space for others by runners, who are pulling away from the defender that's moving towards you.

I feel like Lamela doesn't quite get this.  He neither moves the ball on quickly and simply most of the time, and when he dribbles, it usually doesn't result in any space being created... he's more likely to lose possession in a tackle, a poor, hasty pass, or end up running into someone and committing a foul himself.

Of course, for his assist here, he did the exact right thing, which was touch the ball three times to move into space, and then release the ball just as a defender tried to close him down, which allowed Kane to burst free.  The problem is he doesn't get between the lines often enough, so when he runs at opponents, he's too often running at midfielders rather than defenders.  The only reason he got so much space in this instance was because Newcastle had thrown everyone forward in search of an equaliser.",null,0,null,1429600753,null,0,false,0,cqjfcva,null,t3_3394uo,null,t1_cqjfcva,null,t3_3394uo,null,null,null,1432512974,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

Obviously we've been linked with Lacazette and Benzema in the recent past, but seriously. No CL (probably) and losing Gerrard are blows to our ability to attract top players.

* It's safe to say you're planning on doing lots of spending, I may be missing something since I only had a skim but I don't see how you're going to be able to fund all these different things purely by taxing the rich and reducing tax evasion. Further to that I can't see a plan for reducing the deficit despite you mentioning how bad it is right now, Is this manifesto fully costed?

* Could you explain the Robin Hood Tax on the stock market? I'm not quite understanding why that'd be a good thing.

* With the European Union, you appear to want reforms, how do you plan on achieving that?

* With the reduction of surveillance that you wish to do, do you not worry that some cases of terrorism where communication is done purely online would rise?

Lucas is pretty limited as a DMF, though, he lacks physical presence which he makes up some of his weaknesses with his positioning. We need to replace him eventually, we can't rely on him with his fairly constant injury troubles.

If Henderson has some decent DMF behind him he can make more late runs into the box and help the attackers press more. These are his strengths. With Allen or Gerrard besides him we can barely afford him joining the attack. That's what's currently limiting him.

What I wanted to say - Henderson isn't the problem. He even brings in very decent numbers for a midfielder. He is the only midfielder bar Coutinho who has done his job well this season.

&gt;Now I wouldn't say that those who don't agree with me aren't level-headed but as far as sacking Rodgers is concerned I would say that anyone who wants to see Rodgers going out of the door just because Klopp is available is not being level-headed at all.

Your opinion is that Rodgers should be kept on. Other people want him gone. You *are* saying that the people that disagree with you aren't level headed.

&gt;Not only that it's got something to do with being swayed by the media as well. The whole Rodgers' being the first coach since the 50's to not win a trophy in three seasons is a media circus because each era is different and cannot be judged by the same yard-stick.

The first person I spoke to at the bank (NatWest FWIW) cancelled two of them, but then I checked PP again and realised that there are four more pending ones for another £1500 and called the bank back at which point I was given the 'Speak to PayPal, it's not our problem' line.  If the first two are in fact still cancelled I *might* be able to take some cash out of my account later today before the next lot of DDs go through, but the second person I spoke to at the bank gave the distinct impression that that wouldn't be possible anymore.

I'm really fucking angry with PayPal, I hardly every use (twice in the past 18 months) and only every for values of no more than £10, I've *never* used it to ship items to another another country or anyone else in this country, but apparently they only flag suspicious activity and lock the account *after* they've taken the huge fucking amount of money out of your bank.

&gt;#Aston Villa Review: Episode 117 - Villa beat Liverpool to reach the FA Cup Final
Wow. What an incredible weekend to be an Aston Villa supporter. Let nobody tell you the FA Cup is dead because it clearly means plenty to the supporters, players and manager of this football club. We don't need Budweiser to sell it to us, or a matchday announcer to rev us up; we felt it at Wembley and getting to the final is an achievement none of us should underestimate.

&gt;In this week's show Chris and Steve attempt to digest Villa's victory over Liverpool on Sunday. If the players felt anything like the sense of occasion that took hold in the stands, they showed none of it. A swaggering, professional and exciting performance guided them to a thoroughly deserved win and the chance, incredibly, to bring home a major trophy at the end of this awful season.",null,0,null,1429608072,null,0,false,0,cqjgxvx,null,t3_33c4yi,null,t1_cqjgxvx,null,t3_33c4yi,null,null,null,1432513721,null,3,false,avfc,t5_2s569,3,null

Of this maybe 2/3 is gas and 90% of that is in winter.

So, electricity is only about £30 a month, £80+ a quarter, £300+ a year.

Heating costs more than anything else. So that means use of the oven could be expensive, assuming a dual-fuel cooker. Fridge-freezer could be expensive.

Why don't you test it by switching things on and off and watching the meter increment? That should isolate what it might be....

EDIT: by the way, check your tariffs and compare providers too- you may be on a very bad tariff- from dual fuel direct debit to plain normal can be 50% different.

EDIT2: I just checked our usage, we use 300 to 400 kwH of electricity per quarter- that is for fridge-freezer, washing machine, TV, hifi, electric oven, kettle, microwave.

Personally I think food labelling is pretty shite.

Or even worse they calculate ""per serving"" and then tell you a serving is 1/3rd of the total pack.

Why? The position of the UK in the world both politically and economically is a direct result of slavery and colonialism. 

Your timescale for these events is off, because it was not ""400 years ago"" that slavery and colonialism existed. Slavery was not completely abolished in this country until 1843 (less than 200 years ago, roughly 7 generations ago), and the country continued to benefit from goods bought in countries which had not abolished slavery for a while after that as well. The British Empire did not really start to decolonise until after WW2 (70 years ago, 2-3 generations ago), and this process didn't conclude until 1997 with the transfer of Hong Kong (only 18 years ago, less than a single generation). 

These events are part of the very recent past, and their influence is still felt in the lives of every single person in this country, to whatever extent, not to mention their influence on the country as a whole in the international community.

That said, I agree with Joe64x above in so far as the rhetoric goes a bit too far. 

The problem for me is that this doesn't hit the right mark either. Even though contemporary Britons (all of us really) may be reaping the benefits of the nation's colonial past, this does not make us responsible for it. I see the hypocrisy of the contemporary attitude in light of this, but shaming isn't really the answer particularly when the modern citizenry just simply weren't responsible. 

It's a bit like going back in time and trying to blame slave drivers for having slaves when that was completely normal at the time. Immigration today is an issue that needs to be addressed in some way. 

The right mark I think would be to focus on isolationism (perhaps a term somewhat synonymous with localism, at least in its unloaded, geographical implications) being a reaction to globalisation. 

For some communities these rapid multicultural changes are too much, possibly even a threat in any number of ways, and thus deserve to be aired.

&gt;They're not about being ""Scottish-enough"" or ""born here"" or any of the stuff you'd hear from other folk. That's a perfect example of modern, civic nationalism in that it's all based on residency, not nationality.

Is incompatible with this:

&gt;I believe in the fundamental of all peoples in the right to self-determination absolutely, in perpetuity.


You can't argue both that your nationalism is based on residency and that 'all peoples' have the right to self-determination, because then you *are* making it about nationality in some way, unless you're describing 'peoples' as 'any fairly homogenous group living in any are at any given time', in which case the 'in perpetuity' portion of the argument makes no sense.

Neither of the previous two statements is compatible with this:

&gt;It's not about history (you'll never hear the Scottish Government harping on about historical stuff), it's about the future.

(Also, they care so little about history that they insist on restoring a national border that hasn't existed as such for centuries and on holding the referendum on that decision on the anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn? That doesn't really scan.)

Or this:

&gt;The SNP believe that the polity of the people of Scotland (note: not the Scottish people), is sufficiently distinctive enough to warrant secession from the rest of the UK.

So, because the people in Scotland *right now* are different from people living in Britain *right now*, that means that they should *permanently* secede from Britain? And also, all the people who are 'sufficiently distinctive' from Britain that they should secede just happen to be North of a national border that was abolished 300 years ago, but this *isn't* about history?

Incidentally, you're also wrong about Scotland's distinctiveness: Once you control for class background, you find that Scots have virtually identical opinions to the rest of the country on virtually every topic. The apparent differences in headline figures like voting intention is largely down to the uneven geographic distribution of income in the UK, which is just as much of a problem for people who live in seaside towns in South-East England as it is for the Scots.",null,0,null,1429609376,null,0,false,0,cqjh78d,null,t3_32x7i8,null,t1_cqjh78d,null,t1_cqidmty,null,null,null,1432513843,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

Yes, a given individual shouldn't feel responsible for the acts themselves, as they didn't commit them. However, i think that everyone should feel a responsibility to set right the harm that those acts did. I see that as a part of the responsibility that (in my view - I realise this is a point that many will disagree on) everyone should feel to society as a whole and other human beings. As we have all (mostly) benefited from colonialism in some form, we should feel a sense of duty to undo that damage. This isn't to say that people should feel personal shame, or *be* shamed, for their ancestors' actions, as a modern citizen is not at *fault* for the damage. I still feel, nevertheless, that it is our problem to solve, and we should act as though it is, rather than dismiss it as ""something in the past"".

The other point I'd make is that while  individual citizens of this country shouldn't feel a personal responsibility for colonialism and slavery themselves, the state and society as a whole *should* feel that personal responsibility. The state of the UK was directly responsible for those acts, and benefited from them greatly, and therefore I'd say that the UK, if not the citizens of the UK, should be under an obligation to correct the harm done by its action.",null,0,null,1429609959,null,0,false,0,cqjhbeo,null,t3_339me2,null,t1_cqjhbeo,null,t1_cqjh6el,null,null,null,1432513897,null,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3,null

Hitler offered us peace so long as we bend to his will, we told him to get fucked and it cost us the Empire but we played our part defeating evil. I know that was then but the principle belief holds. 

We've also created many of the world's amazing inventions that we should be proud of (Industrial Revolution, Magna Carta, First Air Force etc  and also some we should be ashamed of (Concentration camps etc)

It's a very peculiar and interesting issue -- I was lucky to have a chance to take it up in a course on Justice, Ethics &amp; Law. We focused on the Mabo cases in Australia (aboriginals displaced etc.) 

I think you're right insofar as we must be aware of the past because it helps us understand how we got to where we are today. And I agree it is certainly part of the responsibility -- it goes without repeating that it is a relevant issue of the day and should not be dismissed. This article however, oversimplifies the issues so Frankie can go on about his political opinion, and I didn't find it particularly enlightening or useful, but rather self-serving. 

I think I'd describe your approach to the issue as deontoligical -- we have a duty akin to a categorical imperative, regardless of our personal responsibility in the matter. This is a completely noble and valid view to take, and I'm completely on board with the notion that we must do something. It only runs into trouble when you have to consider who it is 'the state' represents, and how far back it should go in making reparations for its past iterations as a symbol of the polity. 

Combine this with the typical left wing attitude that generalises *against* globalisation, and we're in tricky logical territory.

On a council estate, on the other hand, a lot of people are there not out of choice but out of need and have little choice in where to live, and if the council then doesn't do a good job in managing troublesome tenants, you can easily get into bad situations where the troublemakers that end up there are more likely to stay put, while others will be more likely to want to and manage to get away from the bad parts of estates. Let that fester for a while, and you can get ever-increasing concentrations of bad eggs ruining it for everyone. Even if they may never make up a very large portion of the total population on an estate.

Ultimately it's a problem of how tight ship the council runs when it comes to managing the estate.

Haha with that name I assumed you were in law in some form or other. I'm studying law myself at the moment, and next year I'll probably be taking a jurisprudence module or something like that so I might get a chance to study this sort of thing in a proper academic environment.

I agree that the article oversimplifies, and that it's largely trying to make a point in a very direct and provocative (though not even slightly nuanced) way. I don't necessarily think the article is making it's point effectively, but I think it's a point worth talking about.

I agree that it gets very difficult if you have a state under an obligation to do something which its population do not want, if the state is supposed to represent the people. However I'd say that there are generally ways to get around that sort of issue, with compromises and different approaches. I'm not really trying to comment on exactly what should be done (because frankly I'm nowhere near knowledgeable enough to do so right now), but more who should have the obligation to act at all. Conflicts of obligation inevitably arise all over the place in the course of government, so it then becomes a matter of dealing with individual cases and issues in practice.

As to ""how far back to look"", I'd personally say that as long as the effects are felt, there's an obligation to remedy them, but as the effects are felt less severely that obligation reduces. Still, I don't pretend to have an answer to that question, it's certainly an issue. I just feel that while there are such widespread effects of those actions felt, there should be an obligation to fix the situation.

It is an incredibly difficult issue, and there's no other way it could be because of how complex the situation is. But hey, it's fun to discuss!

I didn't say that at all.

I also didn't say that either. 

Perhaps if you were actually reading what I was arguing for, rather than jumping to conclusions, you could see that my argument is straightforward. If I miss something, ask for clarification, don't fill in the blanks with made-up nonsense. 

As for the boundaries - that's a legal matter. The Scottish Parliament (and thus, Government) can only hold plebiscites within the boundaries set out by the UK Parliament. I'm not saying there's a magical line that's any more special than any other arbitrary line on any other map, but it's the one we have got, it's the one that makes most sense, it's the one that's recognised by most people, it's the one that is extant within legal jurisdictions. Any change to this (such as the change the suffrage) would be seen as ""gerrymandering"" and ""cheating"" and all sorts of other nonsense. I cannot see any other suggestion the Scottish Government could have realistically made. If you have one, I'd love to hear it. 

I don't think that anything should be ""in perpetuity"", it's stupid. Nothing lasts forever, and it's really not helpful to sensible discourse. If the people in contemporary Scotland think that they should be an independent country - good for them. If the people in Scotland in 2200 think that they should enter into a union with England and Wales and whoever else - good for them. That's a decision for the people of 2200. That's democracy. That's self-determination. Things change, people change, societies change, circumstances change and constitutional arrangements should reflect that.

null,false,Jodan87,null,null,null,"The Blue Room and Followtonians are the only two I know which are consistent and out every week. Both are hosted by the same guy, Ped McPartland but very different styles.

[The Blue Room](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-blue-room/id553850224?mt=2) is the show on Liverpool's Radio City every Tuesday I think, it's about 40-45 minutes without ads.

[Followtonians](http://www.followtonians.com) is aimed more at worldwide audience, Ped and and American called Eric Howell co host it. It's anywhere between an hour and two hours long depending on what there is to discuss.

Followtonians is a lot more informal as it's just a podcast and not on the radio. I find the Blue Room slightly better as it's a panel of Evertonians so the discussion is more interesting I find. But both should cover everything you need.

Everton have launched an official podcast a few months ago. But being the official podcast I haven't bothered with it as it'll just be propaganda with no negatives being discussed at a guess.

EDIT: They're are a couple of others but I've found them not to be as good as Ped's and/or they are not produced on a consistent basis. I'll list them below:

[NSNO Podcast](http://www.evertonpodcast.com/category/nsno-everton-podcasts/) Wasn't for me, wasn't being produced reguarly when I was subscribed either, might be different now.

[Not Bitter Just Better](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/not-bitter-just-better-everton/id680166202?mt=2) No idea about this one. Never tried it.

[Echo of the Blues by The Liverpool Echo](http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-podcast-echoes-blues-8976727) Podcast from Liverpool's local paper. I didn't know about this one until last week. I'll definitely be giving it a go though.

[The Official Everton FC Podcast](http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2014/08/13/official-evertonfccom-podcast) For completions sake. Never tried it, but being official they get interviews and access with the team and staff etc. Not tried it but I'm just wary it's an exercise in propaganda.

You said that the people of Scotland were distinctive enough to deserve self-rule. Forgive me for paraphrasing

&gt;you can't also think that 'all people have the right to self-government in perpetuity'.

&gt;&gt;I also didn't say that either. 

[Here is the comment where you said exactly that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BritishPolitics/comments/32x7i8/something_new_is_happening_in_british_politics/cqtidmty) You accuse me of not knowing what you've said. I think it's more worrying that *you* don't know what you've said.

My point regarding the borders is that it's clear that the desire to secede is rooted in history, not in the present. As I've pointed out, the Scots are not, in fact any different from the English. Insofar as there are problems in Scotland and the UK as a whole, it's down to disparities in income (this is an increasing problem across most of the developed world), which is not an argument for secession: It's an argument for greater equality for everyone. We won't get that by splitting up, as the SNP's plan to cut corporation tax in an independent Scotland suggests: It'd be more racing to the bottom, more inequality, more corporate dominance. We can beat those things together, not apart.

It's a bit like pointing the finger at people who may legitimately want/need a sense of control over the matter and shaming them into not being as forward with their concerns.

It turns out (we discovered on Saturday) that the care home was the subject of a Care Quality Commission investigation at the same time that these allegations were being made.

They have been shown to not be providing basic nursing care, staff unable to understand the mental capacity act 2005. Staff untrained in lifting / repositioning, medicines and personal hygiene care given late or not at all. etc. These have all been identified by my friend Tony before any of us knew about the report.

There are two online local paper articles about the failing of the care home, and we plan to be in touch with the authors of those.

Finally, we have found a letter from Tony's wife's consultant physician in neuro rehabilitation who says - 1 month before the alleged abuse - SPECIFICALLY that in her current state, excessive auditory and tactile stimulation could result in false responses. Additionally that he has shown extraordinary devotion, and that he needs significant support from the care home.

This whole thing is beginning to look like a concerted and malicious attempt by the care home to limit complaint and deflect blame for their failings (Tony was documenting everything about his wife's care before being ejected and arrested.)

Dodgy multi-buys, special offers that aren't really special, shrinking packs even though the prices stay the same... We've been alerting supermarkets to misleading pricing tactics for the last 7 years! Yet, I'm sure many of you still see dodgy offers on shop shelves. 

Enough is enough. We're now deploying one of the most powerful legal weapons in our armoury - a super-complaint (we need a cape!) - to demand action from the Competition and Markets Authority. You can find a link to our full [super-complaint to the CMA in our blog post](http://conversation.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/supermarket-prices-deals-multibuys-super-complaint-cma/).

The cumulative impact of all these different pricing tactics means it's virtually impossible for people to know if they're getting a fair deal, so misleading pricing tactics must end. A small plea from me... [we've launched a petition](https://whichcouk.bsd.net/page/s/supermarket-pricing) to support our super-complaint and it'd be great if you could sign it so we can keep the pressure up. 

Oh and if you've spotted any pricing tactics that proper wind you up, please share!

I also dont buy the calculation argument. For comparable products its mainly done for you albeit in small print. If you can't think week to week 'this costs more than it used to' then yknow. Write it down maybe. 

Its great someone has the supermarkets in check - they shouldnt be able to deliberately mislead consumers by lying for example. But there has to be some onus on the customer to think for themselves a bit. Someone else mentioned the obesity argument and its similar... plenty of food markets itself as tasty and yet its fattening. You make it a staple of your diet you get fat. The nutrition info is there on the packet. Theres this constant push against making consumers think about what they eat its always 'it should be labelled better.

The fact you say that makes me think you're either not as smart as you think you are or you don't really understand how complex the psychological tricks they use are. They have perfected consumer manipulation.

Price is the easiest thing to work out, although you're not accounting for the fact they change from price per g/kg/litre or whatever to price per unit, and it doesn't account for things on sale or multi buys, the fact you rely on the price tags they display and trust them blindly sums it up really.


I find people who think they're too smart to fall for marketting tricks are usually the easiest to fool.

There's the University of Edinburgh, which is old (1582) and generally prestigious.

There's Heriot-Watt, which is newer (roots in the 1800s, university in the 1960s), and heavily focused towards business and industry (and which has a good reputation)

Then there's Napier, which was formerly Napier Polytechnic, and originally Napier Technical College.

And there's Queen Margaret University (very new) - which focuses on the arts, business and consumer studies, and social and health sciences.

To quickly look at some rankings, here're the four Edinburgh universities plus Leeds:

University|[Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2014/jun/02/university-league-tables-2015-the-complete-list) 2015 (2014)|[Complete University Guide](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings) 2015 (2014)

Heriot-Watt |13 (18) | 33 (40)
Edinburgh |18 (19) |21 (18)
Leeds |28 (34) |23 (32)
QMU |69 (81) |80 (90)
Napier |78 (85) |101 (98)

While these aren't absolutely definitive, and it'll depend a bit on the particular course you do, *in general* you can see that Leeds is in a different league to Napier.

City wise, Edinburgh's a gorgeous place to live (totally not biased here *cough*) though in fairness it's also not the cheapest of cities in the UK.

In your situation, where finances are not unlimited, and given the choice between Leeds and Napier, I think I'd be favouring Leeds unless Napier has a particularly strong reputation for the particular course you're doing.

Edit: [This article](http://www.littleatoms.com/society/tragic-irony-censoring-queens-universitys-charlie-hebdo-discussion) suggests that there was no real security risk.  Rather it was cowardice on the part of the university afraid that people might get offended.

It's not one game though, is it.

It's his 3rd season, his 3 year plan should be putting us into CL this season.

He has had 3 years with no silverware at Liverpool.
He's consistently stubborn in his decisions that seem to hinder the team because he is afraid of saying ""You know what, you're right, I'll change it."" How long did he stick with 1 striker up front when we knew it wasn't fucking working, and that's just one example.

These are just a couple of reasons which have been sitting waiting to be sprung.

We've just lost a massive massive game to United that's crushed tp four because managers understand how to beat the 3 at the back with the style we play 3 at the back - they just overload the midfield and physically beat Emre.

Then we went and lost our silverware hopes with the same formation, we were flooded in midfield and Can was physically matched.

Tests were booked in for 11am onwards so I did get couple of hours in the morning just beforehand to hone in my mad skillz.

Edit: I was also more confident going into my Mod 2.

Top tips that helped me nail the Mod 1:
* During the figure of 8 allow yourself more room for error on the furthest loop, without cone boundaries, and pass close to the cone on your way back round. Gives you more space when you need to avoid the cones used for slalom.
* Just before you do the controlled stop, the examiner will head off and turn on the speed trap. After you do the controlled stop ask him how fast you were going. This will give you a rough idea if you need to add any speed to hit the requirements for the next 2 maneuvers.

I'm sure they'll tell you all the above but worth mentioning as they helped.

Best of luck when you do your tests mate.

&gt;Progress Online

Oh dear.

Anyway the majority of this is just the usual partisan tribal rhetoric as we have come to expect from Foulkes (also the blairite Progress telling anyone how to be left-wing is hysterical). It's pretty easy to refute most of this frankly and I'm killing time at the moment so I'll go through it. The ScotRail franchise bid is probably the most spurious line I've heard from Labour in quite some time. It could not be put out to public tender because guess what? The Scottish Government does not have that power as it is reserved. The Scottish Government did indicate it was minded to support a bid from a publicly owned body when and if it had the powers but it was not within it's remit and holding off the new tender would have just renewed the contract with the frankly terrible FirstGroup service. Of course that doesn't stop Labour attacking the SNP for it. 

Council Tax on the other hand is a regressive tax which the SNP wanted to change but the then Labour government refused to release the funding (council tax benefit) the SNP needed to implement it. I'm not the biggest fan of the council tax freeze to be fair but the SNP argues it actually benefits the less well of because of it's regressive nature. Whatever the case the SNP are now on course to change it now the situation with council tax benefit has changed so it will soon be irrelevant. Also a council tax freeze was in Labour's 2011 Scottish Parliament manifesto so if Labour had won they would of done the same (this becomes a familiar theme by the way). The fact Labour continue to stick to the Council Tax and it's outdated valuations which hit poor people particularly has always been a big mark against them for me. The Council Tax is just a poorly re-jigged Poll Tax after all.

The SNP actually have a policy on the living wage and have a Fair Work programme and have been pushing for companies to join and have been relatively successful in this regard. Hard to see how they aren't progressive on that. Curiously enough almost every party in Scotland has a policy on the living wage (even the Tories) so it's could be an area of consensus if the parties weren't so tribal. Also it should be pointed out Scottish Labour send a lot of shite bills the SNP's way and frankly the SNP are quite right to strike some of them down. The idea though that the SNP preferred Tory support to Labour support during the minority years and essentially locked Labour out of any agreement is an outright lie, Labour got quite a lot passed during that time as did the Lib Dems and the Greens. What didn't help was Labour's constant disruption from the sidelines, I remember one budget where the SNP introduced everything Labour had been asking for as amendments (apprenticeships etc.) and Labour still voted it down. The SNP had to threaten to call another election at one point because Labour were obstructing the budget.

So other than that the only points that sort of stand up are the cuts in college places, personally I do have a problem with that and would like the SNP to do more but seems a bit odd to attack the SNP over free tuition since it is now a Labour policy too. Same goes for universal free benefits, Jim Murphy has signed up to that, it was in the 2011 manifesto and it is a well worn Labour principle. Also Welsh Labour were the first to introduce Free Prescriptions (well actually if we want to go back it was how it was in Bevan's original NHS) so I'm guessing Foulkes doesn't consider Welsh Labour progressive either?

So other than the college places and something about Brian Souter being homophobic (the same sex marriage bill in Scotland was an SNP bill Foulkes) what was George's point again? A wee tip Foulkes, if you want to criticize the SNP do it on something where Labour doesn't have the exact same policy. Policing &amp; Justice is an area of weakness for the SNP, go after that next time.

**tl;dr Labour attack the SNP for policies that are also in the Scottish Labour manifesto.

I don't like how taxpayers subsidise their lifestyles. Those are my reasons, but I'm not trying to pursuade others particularly. We live in a democracy, after all, right?

Anyway, I'll quote from a blog [here.](http://www.welshnotbritish.com/2014/02/that-royal-myth-about-tourism.html)

&gt;But why stop there, if we look at London's official tourism site the top 10 London attractions by visitor numbers for 2012 were as follows.

&gt;British Museum, Tate Modern, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, London Eye, Victoria and Albert Museum, Science Museum, Tower of London, Madame Tussauds and the Royal Museum of Greenwhich.

&gt;The astute will note that Betty's palace isn't on there. Some will say it's because people just stand outside it, well they could do that if it was empty couldn't they? But what about the guards in the funny hats I hear you ask. Well they could still have them there if they wanted as security when they fully open up the palace to visitors. Perhaps even turn it into a hotel, casino or how about the world's biggest cat house. Think of the tourism that could bring in? Businessmen would flock to spend time with some of Miss Betty's girls.

&gt;So what about France? Their version of Betty's palace is the Palace of Versailles which welcomes 5.3 million paid visitors every year. It is the fifth most visited paid attraction in France. Just to put that into perspective, their symbol of France's former absolute monarchy welcomes just under a fifth (18%) of the visitors that the UK welcomes.

Buckingham palace performs nowhere near as well as the Pallace of Versailles, so your asertion that it being lived in helps it in comparison is evidentially false.

Conclusion

These are just the first decent enough links I came across, but it does highlight two of things. Firstly there are examples and case studies from all over the world, and I'm ~~sure~~ hopeful that the staff in the Department of Transport are well trained in urban planning. The second problem however is why is a public company allowed to run at such a lose; with a projected lose of £14m this year, I can only assume the top lads are doing the following:
1) Using £50s a lighters
2) Using it to pay for all the hookers and coke
3) Putting it in a nice little offshore bank for when we all learn how shite they are and they end up fired.

IN:

First choice RB: No idea, but I hope we have someone solid, stable, and consistent here.

Backup LB: Again, not sure. Maybe someone like Trippier but I don't think he's really good enough.  It would be cheeky to have a go at getting Cresswell back (I think he could actually really push Moreno for the starting spot), but I doubt we try.

2 midfielders: This is where things get interesting.  I think we need a creative force who is an expert in facilitating transitional play quickly involved, like Pjanic for example, but I'm not sure how we'll attract a talent like that.  I hope the club has a cheeky bit of scouting done here and we can get a nice Coutinho/Sturridge-esque deal done. Someone like Illaramendi could work out well as he can really pull the strings from deep and release the play going forward in the same vein as Xabi or the older model Gerrard. Realistically we'll probably overpsend on some bullshit though.  Good news is I really think Milner will be the other midfielder coming in, which is good because he has nice leadership qualities and he's picked up even City a fair few times to lead by example and spur them on in games they looked a bit lazy (something we desperately need).

1 striker: Probably Danny Ings, but I don't think that's good enough.  I wouldn't be surprised to see us stick with young strikers because Sterling can play there in a pinch (we fucking have 3 fit strikers right now and Sterling still starts up top), but barring Sturridge there's still not a ton of firepower or clinical finishing in our front line.  Origi is anything but clinical, Balotelli still isn't sure if he's supposed to kicking field goals or trying to keep it under the bar, and while Ings has had a great season; is he as ruthless in front of goal as we need him to be?    I really think we need a bigger name player with an established record and proven quality here more than anywhere else to lead the line, but I don't think we'll get one.

So, if lots of people are placing bets on Miliband and he wins the bookies may lose money.

Balo also finally gets a fucking friend to play with so we can see him look a bit more comfortable.  with Can and Henderson both in midfield I think it becomes safer to play Coutinho to one side of the diamond.

Vilification is systemic oppression because it relies on power requires access to the modes, methods, channels of communication available to the powerful to achieve its aim of denigrating a group. 

The clue is in your own sentence. You said ""daily vilification"". Your words. These imply a systemic campaign. For a campaign to be systemic ( and by implication of your own quote) in the media  then it requires access to power. 

I know it's fun to use words like ""equivocating"" on the internet because it sounds like one has actually read some Aristotle, but in this case, the relevant philosophers are people like Hegel, Nietzche and phenomenology. Weber also clearly demonstrates that power flows through the structure of society, and the expressions of media, news papers, beaurocracy are the expressions of power. 

Now, considering all that - it is untenable to suggest that ""white males"" are anything but the segment of society that wield most power. As a grouping they dominate media, politics, bureaucracies and corporate environments. It is a repeatedly proven fact. Thus society itself reflects that domination.

Of course we are striving for the best, my point is that if we finish 5th it'll be a record for a club as low as we were in the first half of the season. Not the best of records to attain but if you had asked me for 5th when we were 12th I would've taken it in a heartbeat.  So yes, it definitely could be worst, as 100% of clubs who have been where we were earlier in the season have not finished higher than 6th.  It's a literal statement.


It's not the best record to be breaking, but it reflects pretty well on Brendan Rodgers.  He's young, he makes mistakes, but he's learning.  He's the third youngest manager in the league.  We've lost two premier league games this calender year, and we still got further than Chelsea, Man City, and Utd in the FA cup.  Every club above us has significantly more resources than us, have been in the top 4 consistently over the last decade, while we were finishing 8th a couple of years ago.  It was BR who turned that shit around.

Edit:  To add to my point, I would expect a better season next year, but to right off Brendan when he is a young manager learning, who almost won us the title last year, and has had to deal with losing a player of Suarez quality for the first time, is absolutely absurd.  Do you not remember how bad it was chopping and changing managers every couple of years?

I think politically we're both in agreement, so we can put this to one side. No real need to expand on why it's morally appropriate to help 'our fellow man' and so on. It's straightforward to frame the debate in this way, and not always particularly helpful since inevitably it involves moralising these complex issues. This is necessary of course to influence people etc etc, but doesn't really help us 'solve' the problem or get us to look under the hood at the relevant law. 

Enter legal reasoning. The issue I have with the syllogism is that why should we do X on account Y due to Z? Why not due to W? This isn't straightforward to answer. 

But in either case or no matter the answer, how should we frame the rule that enables, facilitates or enforces [insert imperative word here dependant on your jurisprudence with regards the role of law in society], us to do X on account of Y *due to Z.* How far back should we look? How do we measure this other than in vague terms of the current Zeitgeist? What is truly the current Zeitgeist?

Basically I'm borrowing a bit from CLS jurisprudence, but rejecting their absolute equivocation between law and politics (I don't think these two are entirely the same or completely synonymous). I see a triangle with overlapping corners; morality, politics and law at each point.

What you say re globalisation seems somewhat contradictory since you're accepting that it's particularly relevant yet saying at the same time it is entirely separate for the most part. I don't quite follow, but we can talk about globalisation separately if you wish. 

Full disclosure: I'm a Lib Dem. I just see an incoherence between leftist papers' stance on globalisation (read pejoratively: neo-liberalism) and the teething pains (as manifest in the attitudes of Ukip, for instance) of multiculturalism. They almost want to cut and paste the perks of globalisation ('one world' open to all cultures, nice positive language etc.) while overplaying the inequalities of the system.

Most places in Europe have large English-speaking expat communities, with many Brits who assume they're only there for a year or two and make next to no effort to learn the language. I lived in Poland for a while, and I acknowledge the language is extremely difficult, but out of the dozens and dozens possibly hundreds of people who were English that I met, not more than a handful were making any active attempt to learn the language or seriously integrate. They more or less wholly remained within their expat communities. I met a guy who had been there for nearing 6 years and he could scarcely even order a meal in Polish. I've found this to be the general pattern wherever I've lived, and I am almost certain that most people who have travelled widely and met with expats will say the same. 

I think it's as much an anglophone problem as it is a British one. Most Americans I've met are also like this.

null,false,TechJesus,null,null,null,"God, I had no idea Boyle had such imperial angst. I appreciate it's difficult to be funny and make a point, but this article is so full of factual rubbish that it defeats itself.

&gt; White Americans have a stereotype of black people being criminals purely because they can’t acknowledge that it was actually white people that *stole* them from Africa in the first place.

Firstly, they *bought* them from other Africans. Secondly, it is quite a challenge to become a millionaire by robbing a homeless man.

Wealth, as the Scotsman Adam Smith could have told you, has always been about providing goods and services. Yes, the Europeans bullied and harried everyone from Cape Town to Beijing during the Imperial Age, but they also built trade routes, invented things and set up the beginnings of the global economy – which does a far better job of feeding and clothing people than the local economies that existed before.

&gt; Britain is the true scrounger, the true criminal.

We aren't. I doubt there are many countries that spend more time worrying about their place in the world than Britain. All the main party leaders bar Farage are happy to commit to the international development budget. Before Iraq we were happy to come to the aid of countries in need militarily, and we still retain something of that instinct.

Ironically Boyle is doing exactly the thing he protests about: taking the behaviour of the few and stigmatising the many. At around 15% of the vote Ukip is widely regarded to have peaked. Their supporters are largely white, middle-aged men with few links to any actual power. They are marginal figures in a country that largely repudiates their views.

And yes, people want more controls on migration, but we are in the midst of a housing crisis and are told the NHS is on a permanent brink. Frankly, we are also in need of some major infrastructure spending – a tough ask given Miliband's surrender on the austerity debate.

[Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BritishPolitics/comments/32x7i8/something_new_is_happening_in_british_politics/cqidmty). So that you don't have to click it, here's what you said, with the key point in bold:

&gt;I absolutely am pro-European integration, but still think that Scotland should be a memberstate in its own right, distinct from the rest of the UK. It's not about history (you'll never hear the Scottish Government harping on about historical stuff), it's about the future. The SNP believe that the polity of the people of Scotland (note: not the Scottish people), is sufficiently distinctive enough to warrant secession from the rest of the UK. **I believe in the fundamental of all peoples in the right to self-determination absolutely, in perpetuity**. The people in Scotland voted to remain in the UK, so that's what will happen. It's not my preference, but that's democracy. It's not based on historical slights at all(indeed, you'd hear more historical references from the ""no"" camp""), it's a looking-forward, what's-the-best-deal-for-our-representation thing.

You're clearly *not* talking about what you call 'the polity' as you made a distinction between 'people' and 'polity' in the previous sentence. Now, if you want to back down from this position, that's fine. What you cannot do is pretend you didn't say it and swear at me when I remind you that you did.

This point is ridiculous.

Tesco doesn't print special value onto Green Giant's packaging, it comes in like that, what are they expected to do about it? If Green Giant won't play ball and make a deal on larger can sizes, then Tesco have made a deal on the smaller cans that makes them even cheaper than the bigger cans which are normally proportionately cheaper. The smaller ones that are on promotion are then given extra space on the shop floor to be sold from and much bigger point of sale pricing displays than the 'special value' that Green Giant printed on their packaging in an attempt to push sales of the better value line.

Yes, in a very big part we brought this upon ourselves by too many of us switching to the convenience of supermarket shopping over travelling into town. But it's not just consumers who are affected by these supermarket pricing strategies, and in the long run, if nobody attempts to temper the power that these large organisations have, we will all lose. And by the time enough people realise it, it will be too late.

One reason I continue to shop at Sainsburys rather than switching to cheaper stores is that from what I read [they pay farmers better rates](http://www.nfuonline.com/news/latest-news/sainsburys-dairy-advert-nfu-comment/).

In the 80s, Thatcher got rid of most of the unions for reasons I don't care about and Foot wanted to reverse it.

By the end of GCSE you're lucky if you can confidently order food in a restaurant abroad. 

I've spoken to people from France, Germany, all of the Nordics, Belgium and the Netherlands and they all started learning English at a young age and we're able to speak fluently by 16. Now I know not everyone will be that good at speaking a foreign language by then, but I'm confident that of schools did a better job of teaching language then we would have far more multilingual Brits. 

I think one of the issues that cause this is a lack of focus towards a specific language. If you're in Europe, then learning English will be useful due to how Anglocentric the media and Internet are. But in Britain and Ireland we don't have an obvious choice. French, German and Spanish are popular due to being so close, Chinese is taken by many due to how fast China is growing, Slavic languages useful in many areas of the UK as well as their origin countries. 

Where do you start, especially when you consider the limited resources of schools and lack of teachers?

What research did you do, and what were your expectations about the recovery period? How many passes did you do on each area, did you go over any more than once? If yes this intensifies the acid. You should also not be increasing the length of time after a week, increase ONE thing only - with a new product that is frequency OR length of treatment OR number of passes.

Peels are intended to damage the skin barrier in a controlled manner, basically over exfoliate. If you want regular exfoliation do not use a peel. The skin barrier keeps water in and bacteria/ irritants out, when it is damaged it may fail to do this so you need to baby it not use your regular routine. Being alkaline the neutraliser also damages the skin barrier, the acid mantle and beneficial flora that help keep opportunistic bacteria out.

Never exfoliate for a few days before or a few days after a peel, I drop my muslin cloth so IMO no konjac sponge. A week apart is very close, you should therefore not be exfoliating at all in between. Use occlusives NOT moisturisers afterwards, water can reactivate any residual acid and many of the ingredients can irritate.

Also no sun exposure - stay indoors a couple hours either side of solar noon the first few days - roughly 11am until 3pm - religious application *and reapplication* of a broad spectrum sunscreen, ideally physical not chemical. Be aware UVA particularly can penetrate glass, cloud and shade. No make up whilst skin looks or feels irritated.

null,false,mrmessiah,null,null,null,"&gt; How do you know if something is good value? The only real way is to look at the market. What is everyone else prepared to pay?

Thats true to an extent. Look at diamonds and their percieved vs actual value. If I offered you a diamond while you were dying of thirst in the desert, I doubt you'd buy it. But you might offer me everything you had for my flask of water. Or to pick a less out-there example the toy that every kid wants at Christmas. It was a surprise hit so theyre scarce, and no kid is going to want the competitors second best alternative. Market forces push the potential value of that item up.

Chocolate eggs on the other hand, mass produced and non scarce, mostly replaceable with any other chocolate egg. Or any other chocolate for that matter. Sold with a weight, so you know how much egg youre getting for your money. Chocolate prices arent the most volatile, but were not talking about investing in cocoa futures here... you know roughly how much chocolate costs by weight based on any other chocolate purchase you make. Add on a bit for the novelty shape and packaging. So is it worth the money to you? Most people can work that out, and most of the others instinctively know if easter eggs are a rip off especially if theyve ever bought one.

&gt; When a shop tells you an item was previously on sale at a higher price, they are presenting that as its true market value.

Thats implied at most. Thats reading way too charitably into the supermarkets intentions and thats part of the problem, we assume supermarkets are being fair because they market themselves that way. But theyre just businesses like any other.

&gt; A shop wouldn't stack its shelves with goods priced so high that nobody would buy it, right? Except sometimes they do exactly that, and it is a lie, a con.

Theres very good rules about how long an item has to be available for sale at full price before given a sale price. Im not arguing that putting them on sale in january at a high price to get around that isnt shady and cynical. But people can see theyre not good value at the shelf right? Youve got a cost, a weight, youve bought the product before. If you buy a 15 quid easter egg without checking the weight or noticing it was a bit light and then get it home and think ""hey, I thought this would be more like if I bought £15 worth of dairy milk"" at what point do you step in and say well you had all the information to know that was a bad purchase?",null,0,null,1429621650,null,0,false,0,cqjkmpq,null,t3_33bvdk,null,t1_cqjkmpq,null,t1_cqjjjj7,null,null,null,1432515460,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I posted on here a couple of weeks ago about getting started with peels, so I chose a relatively low strength of LA to begin. I knew my skin would feel different after use, and I expected some purging, maybe even some flaking. The first treatment went OK - yes, it stung a bit on application, there was bit of redness, but nothing that lingered. My skin felt soft. So I thought I was fine to carry on treatment the following week by upping the time, as per the instructions that came with the acid.

Your comment about the number of passes is spot on - I definitely went over more than once. I don't think I did that the first time. And the konjac sponge didn't help. Or the neutraliser. Or using moisturisers. I've also been using sunscreen religiously - however, it's the Biore Watery Essence, which is probably not helping due to the drying alcohols in it.

I would, however, be concerned about the number of people who don't, whom I am assuming to fall into the categories of older persons, those who work long hours, those who fall into a significantly lower IQ spectrum who might not have been informed or otherwise not be aware of the concept, and many others. That said, in each group there is inevitably going to be a percentage that do not fall into this gap. It is this percentage, added to the number of persons who already understand and take note of the concept, that (likely) make up a significant minority.

Of course, there are also very likely to be a large percentage of persons who simply don't give a flying fuck - such as those with more funds overall than the average.

&gt; [W]hy should we do X on account Y due to Z? Why not due to W? This isn't straightforward to answer. 

I agree, although I'd also point out that there's no reason it couldn't be both. That's sort of what I was trying to get at with what I was saying about globalisation. Concerns about globalisation and concerns about colonialism are both relevant to the discussion on immigration and might prompt certain action. The reason I was talking about globalisation as a separate point was because I think that while it would be useful to have discussion of immigration with regard to globalisation, I don't think that discussion of immigration with regard to colonialism is necessarily less useful or less worthy of discussion. Sorry if I haven't been clear.

&gt; But in either case or no matter the answer, how should we frame the rule that enables, facilitates or enforces [insert imperative word here dependant on your jurisprudence with regards the role of law in society], us to do X on account of Y due to Z. How far back should we look? How do we measure this other than in vague terms of the current Zeitgeist? What is truly the current Zeitgeist?

I agree that when you look to actual law, and not simply at a vague ""obligation"", it gets very difficult. I think I've been mostly thinking of how people and politicians act and think, so have been looking at the issue from a largely moral and political standpoint, while not really thinking about the legal issues involved too much.

I'm hoping Mourinho is just desperate to win that first title in his second stint here so he didn't give the youth (or even those deemed to be bench players at the beginning of the season) a chance this year. Right now, it looks like we're too afraid to a risk on these youngsters. That's not the right attitude with youth/bench players because we're always going be in the title race so we have to take a risk. We've already seen a glimpse of what the lack of rotation in the PL has done to our best players this season after Christmas. They don't look as sharp and some have looked clearly fatigued overall. Some of the situations where we've stuck to our normal starting XI have baffled me. 

Why has Filipe Luis, the world's best leftback last season, been on the bench outside of cup games even when Ivanovic has had awful stretches of games together? That Luis at LB/Dave at RB combo could be amazing, but we've never even seen it in a match. Why has Zouma not replaced Cahill? I get Cahill was in a slump, but it's kind of unfair that Cahill gets dropped for bad performances and Zouma gets dropped even when he's been better than Cahill. Why have Solanke or Brown make their PL debuts one of the last two weekend? Before you go ""United/QPR is too big of a risk for a youngster!"", I say so what? It's not like Real, Barca, Bayern and United had all their youth academy players who have became first team players make their debuts in perfect conditions. I think if we were in the same situation as United last year and we had Januzaj and Wilson as prospects, they wouldn't make their debuts because we're too afraid to take a risk.

That being said, I can't be too harsh on Mourinho as everything else about his managing abilities gives him the benefit of the doubt and I think this might be a learning experience for him considering he's never had to stay long term at a club to develop ""boys."" No manager is without flaw though and I definitely think rotation/youth incorporation is the one thing Mourinho needs to improve if we're too become as big and stable as Real, Barca, Bayern or United.

Teresa May might be popular with a lot of the conservative party because she has a proven track record, can be pretty fierce across the dispatch box and her professional composure comes across well against Miliband's bumbling awkwardness in the commons. It's also fair to say that women look set to do well in the 2015 election, with Sturgeon obviously having surged in Scotland but also to a lesser extent Natalie Bennetts party likely doing well, especially in areas like the student vote. There might be some appetite in the Conservative party for trying to move away from middle aged white men. It's also worth pointing out, that every single party (with the possible asterisk of UKIP) headed by a white man looks set to lose vote share in this election.

Boris Johnson will be popular from his fairly successful tenure as Mayor of London. He's a more passionate politician than either Miliband or Cameron and arguably sits further right than Cameron. He will face opposition from his party on the basis that a) there might be a perception he represents a London elite, b) his class backgrounds which make Cameron look like a bit of a pauper and c) his slightly more ""out there"" finances - like his US tax arrangements, which might be an easy target for attack. So while he is probably the 'riskier' candidate, he probably still has a good shot at the leadership job - in many senses Boris is a bit of a personable anti-hero that people seem to take well to, despite in many respects being a cookie-cutter conservative by birth. In a nutshell I can't help but feel that I shouldn't like him... but I do.

Osborne will probably also try to get a look in, but I suspect if the cards are down most of the Cameron-camp would back Teresa May so his chances will be quite anaemic from the get go. His best bet would be to back Theresa May in exchange for the deputy PM role while remaining as chancellor (like Brown did). 

I don't think it would be out of the question for Michael Gove to try his luck - but he's a polarizing figure both in and out of his party. After his pretty disastrous spell as education secretary I doubt he'll get very far. His main asset is that within the conservative party he has a bloc of supporters who might route for him.

As for Sajid Javid he probably doesn't have much of a hope against some of the bigger names... having said that, he might be used as a first challenger. This is often a candidate with little prospect of actually winning the contest, whose role is to challenge the incumbent leader for the purpose of creating a leadership contest without hurting the reputation of people with a better chance (i.e. by making Teresa May or Boris Johnson appear to be mud slingers against their former boss).",null,0,null,1429623412,null,0,1429624133,0,cqjlfaq,null,t3_33cepn,null,t1_cqjlfaq,null,t3_33cepn,null,null,null,1432515833,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

The directions I received with the acid said to moisturise afterwards, use sunscreen, and I followed the treatment times exactly.

There isn't a lack of grants, it seems that English students can in some cases get more cash up front, but all that is tempered by the fact that they also have 9k more debt a year regardless. Thats a huge debt:cash ratio different.


And again this is a multidimensional issue. I really don't think the figures would be reversed if we offered a few hundred pounds more a year to the poorest potential students (remember, in return for *much* more debt).


It's also worth noting that the Scottish system is much better for students who aren't the poorest in society, as so don't qualify for the grants, but aren't well off either. Their funding is very similar whether they are in England or Scotland but in Scotland they will have spectacularly less debt at the end of it.

They aren't your friend, and they don't want to help you. People *should* shop with a healthy scepticism and a keen eye for the best deals in order to work against attempts to manipulate them.

Sometimes, however, it's almost impossible for even a smart, keen-eyed person to spot attempts at manipulation. The tactics are so clever and so heavily researched that unless you have every single bit of insider knowledge and a product's entire pricing history, you will be conned, despite your best efforts.

Most importantly, however, is that whilst people with a better level of education will be able to sniff out the best deals and ignore some of the cons, lower educated people are being conned left right and centre. The lowest educated are often the poorest, and they have the most to lose through this price conning. If I pay £1 more for a 6 pack than I need to, it doesn't really matter to me. For someone on minimum wage or benefits, it could make all the difference.

**AFPS 15 Key Points**

* The scheme is non-contribution based.
* A pension accrual rate of 1/47th of pensionable earnings each year.
* Active members benefits will increase by annual Average Weekly Earnings.

After you've taken those into account you need to estimate how much your military pension will be worth when you retire given your pensionable earnings &amp; rank progression. If you've just joined on a short commission as an Officer for example it would be worth about £7,000 per annum at age 60 (increasing with CPI once you stop paying in). Assuming you just started training your commission will be up when you are aged about 33 (unless you exit early, extend the short commission or transfer to a long commission). Some of these details vary greatly depending on rank (e.g. OR or Officer) &amp; role.

Unfortunately with the AFPS 15 you give up your younger years, where pensions earnings *could* benefit the most from compounding over the bulk of your career, for Careers Averaged Revalued Earning scheme whereby the contributions increase only by either Average Weekly Earning or CPI.",null,0,null,1429624240,null,0,false,0,cqjltt3,null,t3_3399sw,null,t1_cqjltt3,null,t3_3399sw,null,null,null,1432516023,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

This season was never gonna be as good as the last one and these handicaps just made it worse. By my estimation we should've at least competed for top 4 this season. Well, we nearly did but not having a striker for so long cost us heavily. We still don't have a striker tbh.

Can a handicapped team do well in big games? YES, it can! BUT to do well consistently in the big games we just need a complete team, the other teams aren't gonna wait for us to score one attempt in 30. More often than not we will come up short when we're severly lacking in one area (scoring goals).

When we started with Lambert against Basel at home, I cried a single tear. It was the epitome of our failure in the summer. 

I think that we've been in the shit since we discovered that Balotelli (and we knew he was a gamble) really isn't gonna be a new ... Sturridge? Backgrounds somewhat similar, no? Just me? But suddenly we though: ""Wait, who's gonna score the goals?"" Shit, let's wait for Sturridge's return. He's injured again? Fuck, well, let's wait for another month and a half... AGAIN? FUCK, I'M DONE! The injury before the last CL games was the last straw for me. I couldn't see how the hell we're gonna solve this.

And we couldn't recover from it. Simple and big mistake at the same time. Not bringing in a striker that we wanted. It has haunted us the whole season and IMO it's not fair to criticise Rodgers too much for not performing with a fundamentally broken squad. Not having a striker that scores is only then allowed when you've got world class midfielders. We only have Henderson, Coutinho and Sterling who are decent but they are no world class. They aren't goalscorers, they can all score couple, but that's not enough. They all need a striker they can rely on to get best out of them.

*Price* £1.50ish, on offer

*Bought at:* Superdrug

*About you* Lips get quite dry, and really sore in the summer, despite the skin on my body and face never, ever burning. 

*Opinion:* This product sucks ass. I'm sorry to be vulgar, but I cannot find a single good thing. I don't find it moisturizing - it's very stiff and waxy. I applied it on dry lips and they still felt dry after. It has a faint, chemically sweet smell. It doesn't soak it, it just sits on the lips.

By far the *worst* part is the taste, though. I don't really like my lips much, so I have no idea how this happened - I guess just through the natural motion of swallowing your saliva. I realised I had a horrible, bitter chemical flavour building in the back of my throat. So I did the cleverest thing I could think of (!) to figure out if this was the balm's fault, and deliberately licked my lips. IT WAS HORRIBLE. I'm sure someone out there likes this product, but I could honestly not recommend it.

This is probably the only lip balm where I would say it's not better than no lip balm at all - it actually made my lips drier.

The impromptu mutual support group discussed in the article seemed fairly promising in these early stages: we know for example that mutual support groups for quitting smoking double their members' chances of success, and of course the lure of cigarettes to an addict is probably far stronger, easier to satisfy, persistent, and ethically fine than paedophilia, presumably making quitting smoking more difficult than avoiding offending against children, for smokers and paedophiles respectively.

This isn't always the same as a reason to be allowed to go free - a person who doesn't know right from wrong may easily be viewed as requiring mental health care and may need to be detained for treatment, and the protection of society at large rather than for their punishment (even though the practical ramifications may occasionally not be dissimilar to one another).

If someone is mentally ill then they may in some circumstances have no control over their actions. As moral actions are deemed to be those over which you have a choice then behaviour where you have no control over your actions cannot be said to be moral. Such actions, therefore, fall outside the remit for treating profoundly immoral behaviour or ['evil'](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/evil?s=t), as you put it.

CM - Milner seems logical, could also get Sissoko from Newcastle, he's a good player. Would also like Illarmendi as if Lucas goes, we need a holding midfielder and if they can pass, all the better

RB - Can't think of many. I would go for a more defensively sound player over someone who likes to bomb forward though, it'll help cover for Moreno's attacking instincts. Janmaat might be good. We'll have Flano as cover or Wisdom. 

GK - If we can get Cech cheap that'd be great. We don't need a first choice keeper though, we just need someone better than Jones to push Migs.

My last shop showed that the branded products I bought were £2.75 cheaper than I would have paid at Asda. The TV commercial also says that if you pay more, then they will give you a voucher for the difference.

Then I realised I *may* have been paying more for half the branded products, but less for just one or two. What they show you as the difference is averaged over the complete basket.

So we don't see what it would be best to buy at Sainsbury's and what would be best to buy at Asda. What I *do* know is that if I see a particularly good offer - six tins of tomatoes for £1.50 or something, I am likely to pick that up. That will generally always bring that basket price compared to Asda down. If I was in Asda, they may have baked beans on offer instead, and I would have picked that up instead. So what I ""saved"" is not actually comparing similar circumstances, because depending on which shop I was in, the basket contents would be different.

But that may just be the way *I* buy - staples for the cupboard I pick up in bulk, when on offer, and they usually last us until the next time they are on offer.

I'm not complaining, just kind of find it interesting how the numbers can be used to make you think you are getting more than you really are getting, or saving more than you really are saving when the reality of human nature is taken into account.",null,0,null,1429626544,null,0,false,0,cqjn26o,null,t3_33bvdk,null,t1_cqjn26o,null,t3_33bvdk,null,null,null,1432516674,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

that would yield about 500-750k per week in wages and maybe 30m in transfer fees. if lucas decides he wants to leave, it will be closer to 40m in transfer fees. 

in: a st, a rb, 2 cm, a back up gk...we have a back up lb in flanno who should be healthy, we have some young guns at rb (mclaughlin and randell) who could step in there. 

for st, i would love to see vietto or icardi...i love south american strikers, they have a certain type of fight that translates well to english football. 

for rb, janmaat is my number 1, but if carvajal is actually available, i would throw the book at getting someone like him. once we sort out rb, our back line would be pretty well settled for years (moreno, sahko, skrtel/ilori, carvajal)

for cm, milner + someone with box-to-box/creative abilities. coutinho can't do it alone all the time and they need to be fit enough to match our pressing style. i've read about allan from udinese, but i also like jordie clasie, gonalons, pjanic obvious, nainngolan...don't know who we would realistically be able to get but i want a tough, take no shit cm who can run and play box to box.

finally, i think depay would be a luxury buy or a replacement for raheem if he did leave. depay is a good finisher, fast, strong and young. fits the bill perfectly. i think our focus now is currently on tying players to contracts (hendo signed 5 years yesterday, skrtel to follow soon, couts already signed up, kolo is in talks and raheem should sign a new deal)",null,0,null,1429626687,null,0,false,0,cqjn56c,null,t3_33c6v2,null,t1_cqjn56c,null,t3_33c6v2,null,null,null,1432516714,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

I don't understand how you can possibly say that Luis hasn't lived up to the title when he hasn't been given a fair shout. How is Filipe Luis supposed to make an impact when he's limited to the odd cup game or rare sub minutes? Players need a string of starts together to gain/regain form. Very few players can be Remy and do well in the 1 or 2 matches they get every month. Why do you think every right winger not named Willian has been shit this season? No playing time to get adjusted to the rest of the team. Fair enough if you think Ivanovic is the better choice is he's less of a risk instead of trying to incorporate Luis when we want to win the title, but it's absolutely unfair to say he hasn't lived up to the title. I also think he can offer a lot more if paired with Dave. We'd still have the one attacking, one defensive fullback combo but Luis is better going forward, knows when to go forward, can get back on a counter with superior speed, has great link up play with Hazard and can score free kicks. Him playing at LB would allow Dave to play at his natural RB position and make him effective going forward as he can whip in crosses from the right. Dave doesn't look comfortable when he's going forward on the left outside of that one assist this season to Costa.

I'm not saying we're in comparable situations at all. You misunderstood. I simply said I feel if we had a poor season that we'd still not take a risk on the youth.

null,false,seamushoo4,lfc68,,null,"&gt; petition! And CL for next season is very very unlikely now. Depay doesn't really need a stepping stone for bayern mate, as they're already interested! Suarez maybe used us as a stepping stone because no other massive clubs were in for him at the time. He had interest from spurs 

no it doesn't mean we're regulars but it means we're competitive, and yes that one year did a lot for our reputation. in addition, our style of play is extremely attractive to attacking players like depay. imagine going to chelsea, he would win a lot of trophies but his style of play would be stifled. same with at man u, they don't play the most positive football, they play for results. BR is plying for performance and hoping results come with it, which in barca's dominant days, it did. that's the benchmark we are *trying* to reach...probably won't hit those dizzying heights but i can dream. 

that's a fair rebuttal to my stepping stone point, nor do i want lfc to be a stepping stone...we should be a destination. i just think if we're selling depay on the project, that is what could draw him in. otherwise, he won't come to us...but i can see our project being a very attractive offer to players. we have shown some serious class and ability to the hurt the 'big boys' of current football climate inconsistently...i can only imagine as this team grows how well we can perform over a season, and that's what you sell depay. you tell him that he's the missing piece and with him, we could be a world power again and that might have some serious appeal.

If you don't believe her for whatever reason then look at it's obvious absence from their GE manifesto.


The SNP have made it abundantly clear many times that there is a **triple lock** on another referendum. Firstly circumstances have to change, such as the UK leaving the EU against Scotland's wishes or a surge in support for independence. Secondly the SNP have to put holding another referendum in their **Holyrood** manifesto and thirdly they have to be elected with that manifesto in a **Scottish** election.


So in short, another referendum will only happen if the Scottish electorate vote for the SNP in a future Scottish Parliament election with a referendum clearly in their manifesto.


EDIT: In fact look, they've not just left it out of their GE manifesto but specifically addressed it


&gt;The SNP will always support independence - but that is not what this election is about. It is about making Scotland stronger.

As for my argument: I've very clearly highlighted a response to stagnant social mobility made by the SNP and argued that it hasn't succeeded. Other parties have succeeded at dealing with an identical problem in the same country, and I've said why I think that's happened.

I think my logic's pretty clear here, particularly for something that, I am told, has recently been through a window.

&gt;As I said Klopp is a good manager. Yes he won titles, in a league that's not quite as competitive as the one in England. That's not a slight against him, it's just a fact.

But he's done  well in the champions league, and unfortunately for Brendan, that's how you make a name for yourself as an elite manager. 


&gt;As it stands DVB are 9th in the table, Rodgers is 5th and people are calling for his head. If Liverpool were 9th lads would be foaming at the mouth for him to be sacked. 

We did have a similar season in 09/10 under Rafa, similar in that we went massively off the boil after several good seasons. And it's true that a significant number of people wanted Rafa out and in the end they got their wish. I think there's a case to be made with Klopp that he tried his absolute best to cope with the constant losses of his star players and did very well in doing so, unfortunately for him losing Lewandoski &amp; a missing Reus was a step too far. Also there is such a thing as the ""magic wearing off"" as in the effervescence that made Klopp so great at Dortmund just kind of wore off, similar to Pep and Barca. He's still a top manager though and a massive name. 

&gt;Also you're making the massive assumption that all we have to do is offer Klopp the job and he'll take it. What happens if you try to get Klopp, he says no and Rodgers seeing that he's being undermined walks out? Then you're in a position of having to scramble to get someone late in the transfer window. 

This is a great point and it is something I'm worried about. Them hicks and Gillette bastards did the same thing with Rafa in trying to get Klinsman behind his back and nearly made Rafa walk during 08/09 iirc. We just have to have faith with FSG and Ayre (it's hard to, I know) that they can have talks with Klopp and be assured of his want to manage Liverpool before making a final decision on Brendan. Does Klopp want to manage us? I think he's said multiple times how he'd rather go to a traditionally big club like United/arsenal or us than a money club like city. Madrid is a possibility too, but let's hope they don't sack their manager the year after they won a European cup, (because they've got history in doing so)

 A player works hard and gains the attention of big teams. Wolfsburg, which is unlikely to be a proper CL contender, is out of the question for KDB if he really wants to win the CL and become better and better.

In the simplest terms, the Conservatives support is more spread out, and because of First Past The Post, share of the popular vote doesn't automatically turn into seats in parliament. That's why UKIP are on 13% or so, but only predicted to get a few seats, whereas the Lib Dems are on 8% and are predicted 15+ seats. Their voters are concentrated in certain places, making them more likely to return a Lib Dem candidate to parliament as opposed to a party with more support but spread out more evenly across the country.

If you can break down the visitor demographics to those places, that might be a bit more meaningful - I've been to see buckingham palace once when I was a kid and see no need to go back - but I'll go to the British Museum every chance I get because exhibits change and there's loads more to see there.

i think your mentioning of rankings is great but that is without context and looking at the team/system as a whole, the team was pretty dejected at that stage before december 15. anyways allen is a good player to have in our squad, and i love him and will defend him til he's gone, but i do think we need a better player in there. he is a great option to have off the bench, great player for cup matches, great player for squad rotation because i always think he performs decently well, never below the teams average. 

lallana is fantastic, truly sublime but has been injured so much. a full pre season without injury and i think he hits the ground running and is an important player for us. lovren had a horrid start as well, but sahko and skrtel are his fonte's. he needs someone a little less reckless to play with him. sahko is our best cb, period. skrtel is probably our most consistent cb period. lovren has potential to be very good and consistent as well a la skrtel. i think he will be a big player for us in europe and cups next season and will really get blooded in well with the squad.

https://www.gov.uk/right-to-buy-buying-your-council-home/selling-your-home

&gt; If you sell your home within 10 years of buying it through Right to Buy, you must first offer it to either:

 - your old landlord

 - another social landlord in the area

&gt; The property should be sold at the full market price agreed between you and the landlord.

&gt; If you can’t agree, a district valuer will say how much your home is worth and set the price. You won’t have to pay for their valuation.

&gt; You can sell your home to anyone if the landlord doesn’t agree to buy it within 8 weeks.

&gt; **Paying back your discount**

&gt; You’ll have to pay back some or all of the discount you got if you sell your Right to Buy home within 5 years of buying it.

&gt; You’ll have to pay back all of the discount if you sell within the first year. After that, the total amount you pay back reduces to:

 - 80% of the discount in the second year

 - 60% of the discount in the third year

 - 40% of the discount in the fourth year

 - 20% of the discount in the fifth year

The problem we currently have is that people are buying homes and selling them within a few years to private landlords. Any discount they pay back is typically small change compared to the rise in house prices.

Many councils either won't buy the homes back, or won't respond to the offer in time, which allows the new owner to sell to anyone. 

What I would propose is that you have to offer it to your original council within the first 25 years. You must wait a minimum of 6 months for the council to respond to your offer. And if you sell within the first 15 years you have to pay back the entire discount - with a scale similar to above for the next 10 years. And the offer would have to also go to a housing association if the council refused, or failed to respond.    

This would prevent people from selling up to cash in on a quick payday after only a couple of years. ",null,0,null,1429628162,null,0,false,0,cqjo0pr,null,t3_33c8jw,null,t1_cqjo0pr,null,t1_cqjngsm,null,null,null,1432517126,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

You have simply displayed what I see all too often, mostly from Labour supporters. They believe in a caricature of the SNP created from spin, a SNP that spends English money and blames everything on the English.


It is impossible to argue with that and I have no desire to do so. I believe the facts speak for themselves however and, back to my original point, we will continue to see the SNP remaining very strong in Scotland at the expense of Scottish Labour until their is a fundamental change in the party.


The Scottish public are not *wrong* by electing an SNP majority in a system designed to oppose that, the natural order of things will not restore itself mystically. At the end of it all the SNP are clearly delivering what the people of Scotland want and Labour is seeing itself ousted from previously ultra-safe seats that haven't left their hands in generations.


I really just don't understand how a party that is being destroyed so consistently and shockingly continues to focus outwards and blame everything on another party that has reached levels of popularity, as the article said, many thought was impossible in this day and age.


So yes we can end it here, I've heard every Labour argument there is about why the SNP is actually terrible and how the election results somehow don't matter. I'd really much rather see Scottish Labour working through it's own flaws because I don't think the SNP being completely unopposed in Scotland for any length of time is a good thing, it could lead to complacency and ultimately less good politics, but I don't hold out much hope for any change in the near future.",null,0,null,1429628406,null,0,false,0,cqjo5yh,null,t3_338ftb,null,t1_cqjo5yh,null,t1_cqjno70,null,null,null,1432517195,null,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3,null

[Here is a post I made regarding our statistics from December 15th and 6 gameweeks forward](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2sebwp/some_interestingpositive_statistics_i_found_for/)

[And here is a post I made a month ago regarding our most recent 6 games in the PL after Lucas got injured](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/3001bb/a_new_look_at_the_underlying_statistics_in_the/) 

I'm not trying to say that Allen alone is at fault for those statistics, but to say that the midfield-trio Allen has been part of is the most effective midfield trio this season is simply not true. 

Yes Allen did fine against City or other teams that try to play their own style against us. But against both City and Southampton we won because of some great long-shots, we didn't create many chances. 

Allen and Henderson shouldn't play at the same time unless we have a pure DM behind them AND a very good attacking 3 up top. When Allen and Henderson plays at the same time without a DM it means that Henderson has to help out a lot defensively and as a result of that he's not taking that much part in our attacks. Hendersons statistics going forward when it comes to chances created, shots etc are at approximately 60% lower when Lucas isn't playing.

I agree that Allen is a great squad-player and backup for Henderson or whatever other CM/AM we buy in the summer but not first-team material unless we get an attacking trio working like in 13/14 when the midfielders didn't have to create as much going forward.

I'm going to take a guess that it's something hydro related. Now if that's true I'd be very surprised that a company would be stupid enough to do something illegal, but then there are always idiots. If this is a legit business then all of your details should be kept within the law of the Data Protection Act 1998.

In order for the police to be able to search your property they will need a warrant unless you get nicked on your doorstep. Now you buying a packet of seeds won't allow this to happen. You buying a hydro start up kit could. Once again it depends on what and how much of it you buy. 

So the long and short of it is that in the unlikely eventuality the company gets shut down (for something illegal and related to drugs), and you've been buying lots (and I mean like industrial amount) of hydro equipment the police probably won't do anything. Buying something once probably won't flag up anything to the police anyway if they did decide to search through this companies customer list. They generally have better things to do.

Simply blaming the Labour Party for it isn't good enough.

There will be more power to the regions; there will be more power to the Scottish Parliament. I didn't say it was localism or federalism, not least because those are quite vaguely-defined terms. My understanding is that the Smith commission was based on the system we have now, and didn't take account of House of Lords reform or future Labour policies (because why would it?). The position of the Labour Party is that we have a better set of policies regarding the governance of the regions, that will help solve the key problem of the UK, which is not 'How do we govern the regions?' but social inequality.

Supporting governments that are doing things right, on a governmental level (ie, the British government and other western governments support them) through trade agreements, food and medical aid etc. As for education, while the elites of a country might be educated in many cases the poor are not. Ensuring that everyone has free access to at least primary education is a good start; this can be done by providing financial support that is designated to educational provision only, going in and building schools, funding teacher's job, sending textbooks and other learning materials, etc.

If their country is 5/10 and ours is 9/10 is it any wonder they'd want to live here? If we help them make their country 8/10, fewer people will consider it worth the effort to uproot their lives, leave their communities, than do currently.

But I think it's more than just desiring a better life. It's about hoping for a safer life too. In some places, like the Congo, people are constantly displaced because the country is engaged in civil war and there are armed soldiers all over the place; wanting out isn't ust about a better life, its about trying to find somewhere where they have a decent chance of living to old age without being beaten up or raped all the time. In some places the religious climate means belonging to a religious minority means they simply have fewer rights to try to earn than other people.

Interestingly, this has the potential to work against the unionist parties. Because the Scottish parliament is elected by AMS and the SNP are so popular, there's very little benefit to an SNP voter giving their regional list vote to the SNP (as the SNP will pick up most constituencies). Therefore, I suspect many SNP voters will give their regional list vote to the Greens.  

Realistically, this stands an evens chance of the Greens becoming the 3rd largest party, but if there was a *tactical* push (from the grassroots) for a split SNP/Green vote (and as soon as the GE is out the way I suspect there will be), then they could even end up ahead of Labour.

null,false,GuzBear,swans2002,Thanks For Everything Bony!,null,"**Team, Formation and other shit:**

Personally, I think that we should revert back to the 4-2-3-1 formation, with wingers. The wingers provide defensive cover for our fullbacks that tend to be exposed when the opposing team attacks. Also I believe that playing wingers would suit Gomis more, and would also help Oliviera because the wingers could provide attacking support for him to play off of or with. In my opinion I think we're wasting Gylfi not playing him in his No.10 position. He would, and would make, our team so much stronger with his range of passing and vision and could provide the vital assists and occasional set-piece or long shot goals. Of course, behind him would have to be the two covering players of Ki and Cork, but then of course what do we do with Shelvey. He is worthy to be played. Like Gylfi his range of passing is immense when he is 'on one.' His long shots are as good as Gylfi's. Personally I feel Gylfi should start over him, I feel like Gylfi is slightly more mobile and is fitter than Jonjo. It's really a 50-50 but for me I feel like Gylfi should start. Continuing down the team, Right back should be Naughton, he is a solid option, decent pace and defensive capabilities with average crossing and good overlapping. We have, in all honesty, missed his overlapping and his energy recently. Centre backs should always be Fernandez and Williams in-case anything drastic happens, if so Amat will easily fit in for one of them. Left back, I personally like Neil, but I see us buying a new left back this summer. Goalkeeper should stay as Fabianksi, unless Roma or some other team take him, he is and always should be our first choice goalkeeper. He is absolute quality in all departments. Good claims, great diving, reflexes and positioning. 

**Possible Transfers:**

**A striker** is more than likely going to be purchased, hopefully Mitrovic but I trust Monk to buy efficiently and purposefully, with the right intentions. Ideally we need a striker that can hold up play, contribute (assists) and score goals in both the air and with both feet. There are plenty of other options and we could take a risk, like we did w/ Michu, purchasing players from second divisions or lower standard divisions, like the Belgian pro league, or the eredivisie, from which we purchased Bony.

**A Winger** is also likely to be purchased. We have Jeff, who should be our first starting winger, if we revert back to the old formation, and the others are debatable. Routledge is good, but has poor crossing, Dyer has hit a bit of poor form and with Emnes, it's hard to see because we've not really seen him playing often for us. I see us buying a fast winger, a player like Montero who is direct, and not selfish in front of goal, but can score goals, and example is Andre Ayew who is more than likely a pipe dream, but would be loved by many if he came to Swansea.

**A Left-Back** is another likely transfer. We lack depth in our fullback positions and so depth is what we need to compete higher in the division. Again, I'm unsure who we could get but someone who could cross a ball would be extremely useful. They'd need a nice amount of pace and good physicality and ability in the air. We were linked with, I think it was, Franc Tabanou who has a cracking left foot in terms of crossing and shooting, so he would be a good option. Our left and right backs need to be overlapping, especially if we don't change our formation from this diamond, so a both attacking and defensive minded left back will be needed.

**Our Aims:**

As a fan, and not a manager, I think our aims should be realistic. Yes this season, so far, has been good, but who knows what the next season brings. For all you know next season could turn out to be a poor one with lots of money spent on players who turn out to be shite and don't care about the club, hence highlighting the reason why our recruitment has to be spot on. If we get our recruitment spot on, our highest aim is probably 7th, maybe with a late push for Europa; it is likely that some players we buy will want to play in Europe and so achieving European football could be our only way of keeping high profile players, like Mitrovic, who I've heard recently being linked with Barca and Real, of course these are from Tabloids and highly unlikely, but you never know. Anyway, back to my point, we could probably reach 7th dependent on how the so called 'bigger' teams play, and we could try and get a trophy like the FA cup or Capital one.

Barker had the worst game I've ever seen from him. He was up against a faster, stronger, bigger full back and he couldn't do anything. Good for his development though, because he needs to learn how to get himself in the game when he's in a full backs pocket.

Also - notice how Angelino stayed back so much because of the threat of Chelsea's RW - and Barker seemed isolated. Later when Tammy Abraham went off, Agelino bombed forward and then Barker came into the game more with his partner in crime outside him - we need to see that next week.

People talk about Barcelona and Bayern bringing youth players through to the first team, it is much easier when you have a B team they can play in and be called up to the first team at any point.  With England not having B teams we are forced to loan our our older youth team players as they are to good for the Under 21 league and not good enough for our first team.  If we had a B team that Bamford could be playing for right now in the Championship the odds are he would of been on the bench if not starting against United when Drogba was our only option.  

The same goes for Chobolah who would likely captain a B team and spend some games on the bench for the Senior side and even get a major role in cups.  

Instead, we are forced to loan out certain players such as Thomas Kalas simply because we need his roster spot.  The only reason Zouma is on the first team this year instead of Kalas was the fact that Zouma is under 21 and doesn't use a roster spot.  That is the same reason Kalas got to stay last year as he didn't use a roster spot.

I agree that training and playing with the first team is the best way to bring players through to the first team.  However the top British teams are at a disadvantage in this situation as there is no good way to do it.  Mourinho has said the goal of the academy/loan system is to develop players to be ready to play for the first team by the time they are 23 years old.  This allows them to call up players to the first team between 18-21 without using a roster spot, loan them out from 21-23, and hopefully have them ready to be full members of the club at that point.  There are certain players that physically mature earlier then others or players that are just huge considering their age and these players (RLC, Zouma) have a chance of breaking into the first team at an earlier age.

I assume Kalas will be on loan against next season, hopefully in the Premier League.  Cholobah and Bamford both have a chance at being on the squad as they will count as homegrown players and not takeup an international roster slot.  Cholobah could easily replace Mikel/Ramires if they are sold and Bamford could be a 3rd choice striker.  The question is does using Bamford as a 3rd choice striker provide more value then getting him a years experience as first choice striker for a lower tier team in the league?",null,0,null,1429632417,null,0,1429632700,0,cqjqps9,null,t3_33c3wl,null,t1_cqjqps9,null,t1_cqjkjpi,null,null,null,1432518398,null,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4,null

Technically yes, but on a practical level none of them are natural allies. You might argue that Labour and Lib Dems are closer than others, but the Lib Dem vote has disappeared.

While the Europeans managed four times (if not more) the amount of slavery than the Arabs did the Arabs were still the major importer of slaves for the centuries prior to European colonisation. We're talking numbers of the millions here. Its an interesting enough adjunct to any discussion on slavery because it provides a perspective. e.g:  

* Slavery was an ancient trade  
* Countries had (prior to the Europeans) exploited these networks for their own gain.  

The ""classic"" discussion often paints the Europeans as creating a new, wicked and unnatural trade but this isn't the case.  
Another interesting piece of the puzzle is the Ottoman capture of Constantinople ~1400ishAD resulting in Europe's historical location of slave import (Crimea) being either heavily tariffed or blocked to them. Perhaps in an alternate dimension the racial slave make up of the Americas would have been very different.

Sam can't be blamed entirely for those draws, while his game plan may have been flawed, the players have to also be partly at fault. Quite simply on many occasions they didn't get the job done. There have been problems with transfers and the seemingly negative playing style, but Sam has ticked virtually every box asked of him, promotion, stability and growth of the team.

Also, the players opinions have to be taken into account. While I'm sure no player would openly say the manager has to go, from all the reports I've read they seem to almost unanimously want Sam to stay.  If this is true it should be taken into account.

I disagree with many of Sam's actions such getting rid of Zarate, not wanting Sakho, keeping Cole and not playing youth as much (not to mention he's quite overpaid) but the board seems to still have faith in him.  Considering the success of the board in recent years in making shrewd transfers and getting the Olympic Stadium (probably the single best thing for the club in decades, if ever) if they see fit to give him another contract, I trust them completely.

Before the Spanish Armada, England was an impoverished backwater, the edge of European society, poor compared to most of the countries of Europe, parts of Africa, and Asia. Britain's wealth and political clout now is directly linked to the activities the British government and private individuals took during the colonial era.

Utter, utter bollocks.  Let's look at the wealth estimates of Angus Maddison, who was the world's leading authority on long term world economic history.

In fact, India and China had roughly the same wealth as Western Europe in 1000 AD.  The gap between the West and 'the rest' had already grown enormously in those 500 years (1000-1500 AD).  And the British economy grew as rapidly in the 16th century as it did in the 17th, when the empire really got going.  But this shouldn't surprise anyone with common sense anyway; you can't colonise so much of the world unless you have an economic and technological edge to start with.  I don't expect posting facts will get me anywhere on this sub but what the heck.

It's worth pointing out that in the result of a hung parliament, the incumbent prime minister gets first dibs on trying to form a government.

I don't see the SNP as a bad thing, and if Labour went into coalition with them I beg to suggest there'd be some interesting policy decisions; but I think appealing to rUK is why Sturgeon is putting so much emphasis at the moment into appearing to act for all the UK. The SNP want rUK to see them as a feasible option so they can get more autonomy for Scotland, and that's not a bad thing—we need more devolution across the board.

**Rose:**  To start people off, you need to be started off.  ""Rose"" set everything up quite well, you get a Normal Person to experience the world through, then here comes the Doctor and whirlwind tour.   Eccleston's season was AMAZING with minimal faults.

**Vincent and the Doctor:**  This episode hit harder emotionally than most any others, for my wife and myself.   So much so that when we got the opportunity to meet Tony Curran that my wife broke down again from the amount of whelm.   Shows that even with the best attempts of the doctor to show how amazing someone can be, that Sometimes even the Doctor doesn't save everyone.

**Impossible Planet/Satan Pit:**   Two part story, perhaps unfair picking, but it shows something not On Earth, something without the Tardis, something without the Sonic.  Its a /spooky/ episode and gorgeously done. 

**Blink:**  A doctor-light episode, shows the versatility of the  series that it does not need to HAVE the doctor as the protagonist to make a great story.  Plus the Weeping Angels are introduced.

**Human Nature/ Family of Blood:**  A gorgeous story, and one of Martha's best.  The part at the end when he ""takes care of"" the family, is absolutely chilling.

Contemporary audiences are a lot more receptive to the idea of a fallible and flawed protagonist, which the Doctor always has been in his incarnations to one degree or another.  The new series in particular calls out the Doctor's hubris regularly (even if it resorts to dei ex machina pretty regularly, too).  That he almost fails completely in Midnight sets up a different set of expectations for newcomers than the typical sci-fi action show in which the heroic protagonist always wins.

It's for that reason ""The Empty Child"" doesn't work as well as an introductory episode.

Personally speaking, I think we're being arrogant with the assumption that our existence in Europe is inherently a better experience due to a few measurable technological differences. ""Deserve"" is such a shitty word to use here as it implies that our lives in Europe is ""better"" than that of a Chinese serf. By what means are we using to define ""better"" and do we genuinely believe they translate? Does the ability for us to read the works of Tolstoy enrich our lives beyond a more primitive existence where we're not even able to read? Does the tribal closeness of a jungle existence ""better"" than a hollow and lonely city dwelling existence as a tiny bee within a giant swarm? Does the King deciding to burn our village down affect us much more than suited businessmen and politicians evicting us or taking away our income due to a vote that we couldn't effect because we were such a minority?  
With the discussion about healthcare are we really trying to say that all that matters is that if ours mothers or children are sick then we'll likely be able to cure them or is the pain of death experienced eventually for all societies? Does the comfort of primitive religion give us the required closure that an educated and agnostic leaning cannot?  
If we are going to argue that Britain did not _deserve_ the gains they received during the colonial era then perhaps we should review any beneficial trade agreements we presently have and rescind them as we are essentially saying that any society that has an advantage is not allowed to exploit it. OR perhaps it is the moral issue of slavery or resource plunder? In which case I assume we're all going to take all of the gold away from all the societies that ever gained it (from China to the Mongols, Greeks, Europeans and America today etc) and go to Africa and put it back in the ground? We're gonna have to tear down all those skyscrapers in Dubai too. Should we also redefine all the borders that were established during wars that lacked correct moral behaviour?  

I don't really think any of this is measurable and I think you're trying to construct a disingenuous narrative to apply to history. I'd suggest wiping the words ""better"" or ""deserved"" from discussions in history or sociology as IMO they don't fit.

Combine this with buy-to-let mortgages and we have a massive shortfall of affordable housing, while a lot (not all) of private landlords are raking it in.

Another problem with this kind of system is that it favours those landlords who already own several homes already, as they have the capital to offer the sellers their asking price right away without the hassle of waiting for someone's mortgage to clear. So first time buyers struggle while the larger landlords take more houses off the market.

One of the solutions suggested to help ease this was to charge council tax to the landlords, regardless of occupancy. Two times the normal rate for an empty property, and charge them extra if they have multiple empty homes.

That way the landlord has an incentive to get people in there, which will usually mean lowering the prices to just about the maximum of what most regions pay for housing benefit. If a landlord has a choice of taking someone on benefits or paying out a large bill every month for an empty property, I think most of them would rather they actually rent out their houses instead of trying to keep prices high.",null,0,null,1429635679,null,0,false,0,cqjsuae,null,t3_33c8jw,null,t1_cqjsuae,null,t1_cqjrnfy,null,null,null,1432519398,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

How are the tyres?  Is the front locked that whole time and then when you try to swerve while under braking with the front locked it puts the bike down instantly?

It usually means you will be near amenities and other people so if anything goes wrong you're safe. You might miss the peaceful isolation of wild camping though.

Personally, I've never done it, as I've grown up in Norway where we only really do wild camping.

Wild camping often, usually, involves driving to the outskirts of a wood or moor or something and then hiking for a while until you find a place to set up. Obviously you're on your own so you have to be prepared, if the weather turns, someone injures themself, etc. you need to be prepared to either walk back to the car or tough it out.

I prefer wild camping but it's surprisingly difficult to do in England legally (private land, etc.). Dartmoor is meant to be great for it.

Now if that all came from electricity that would be at least 4 times what I would expect the cost per unit to be; but as there is some gas usage in there (which is cheaper) it is probably 6 or 7 times more than it should be in cost. Hence, one of those figures has to be wrong.

Economy 7 makes the electricity in the day a little more expensive (a few pence) but not that much more. Also it is strange you have gas heating and an economy 7 tariff.

Just want to explain the logic behind this. We're still reviewing exactly how to enforce this rule.

The reason for quoting the post is so other people can see what sort of post we're removing. The end goal is to get fewer such posts, after all. Perhaps there is a better way to do that? We remove it (rather than just replying), so that these posts don't get voted on, to remove the incentive to make a low-effort post. Internet points or not - people like seeing approval of the joke they made. Seeing it incentivizes *other* people to do it themselves, whereas seeing a mod who removed the post disincentivizes this.

We reply to make it visible to users that we are enforcing this rule. We also decided to enforce it a bit more than we might usually (say, how we plan to in a few weeks time), since such posts had become relatively commonplace. I'm pleased to say they're not as common since the rule was introduced last Tuesday, so we'll probably turn it down a notch when we think it's appropriate.

&gt;As the Centre for Welfare Reform (CWR)has pointed out, people in poverty – one in five of the population – bear 39% of all cuts, including to social care and community services. Disabled people, who make up 1 in 13 of the population, have borne 29% of the burden

There is also something really interesting from Simon Wren Lewis where [he says that the Tories sort of stopped cutting in about 2011](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n04/simon-wren-lewis/the-austerity-con).
&gt;The chart shows Osborne’s original plan for the progress of the government’s current balance until 2015, along with what actually happened and is now forecast to happen in the next year. The slowdown in the pace of deficit reduction in 2012 is plain to see.

&gt;This slowdown was not caused by the government going back on its plans to reduce its spending. Instead it largely reflected disappointing tax receipts, caused in part by an unexpected decline in real wages. Osborne could have stuck to his original deficit reduction plan by raising taxes or cutting spending further. But he chose not to. An honest chancellor would have said that the funding crisis panic of 2010 had passed so the pace of austerity could be slowed. But to do that would have been to admit that austerity was bad for growth, and therefore that Plan A had delayed the recovery. Instead Osborne chose to bluff it out, and insist that his original plan was on track. To do this he needed a compliant media.

1) Subtract the existing matter at the destination and materialize in its place, storing the matter in an unoccupied space (read dimensionally transcendental) in the Tardis

2) Merge with the existing matter, by doing #1, but relocating the stored matter in a defined place (ex: in the control room). In this mode, the tardis most likely subtracts the original matter from the control room and moves it to a dimensionally transcendental place like #1. We see the doctor do this a handful of times where the tardis materializes ""around"" someone to protect them.

3) Expunge existing matter from the destination, by exerting a force that ""pushes matter out"" from the space that the Tardis will occupy at the destination, and materializing in its place.

I personally believe that the default setting is #1 that most Time Lords use, however the Doctor prefers to use #3 most of the time due to the fact that it creates a distinctive ""Whooosh Whoooosh"" sound that jives with his ego. #3 is the proverbial ""parking brake"" that River refers to.",null,0,null,1429638705,null,0,false,0,cqjuudi,null,t3_33d2k3,null,t1_cqjuudi,null,t3_33d2k3,null,null,null,1432520412,null,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2,null

we have a top 10 revenue in world football, 5 of them being in the prem. we have a stadium increase of 15,000, bringing anfield close to 60,000 capacity. we have famous fans that come to anfield, YNWA sends shivers down the spines of almost all of the greats. we have increased our kit deal to 50m per season. our shirt sponsor is 30m per season. our main stand will bring in an additional 5-10m per season. we have vauxhall, garuda indonesia, subway, dunkin donuts, jack wolfskin, and so many more big sponsors that are pumping money into us. we have champions league money now finally coming onto our books. 

so to recap in a summary: 

1. we have enough money to compete with almost anyone in the transfer market bar maybe 5-8 teams (mufc, chelsea, city, arsenal, psg, madrid and barca)

2. we will have the third largest stadium in england behind old trafford (75k) and emirates (60k)

3. we have a young, exciting team with a young, attack minded coach...who happens to also let young players express themselves on the pitch and is a great trainer...all players i've heard asked about him in interviews have very high praise. 

4. our club has been on an upward trajectory, finishing 2nd last year and competing for top 4 and getting to the semis of both domestic comps. 

5. we will likely still have europa league next year, which isn't as presitigious as CL obviously, but is still europe and has a good bit of good sides in it. 

i can see depay wanting champions league and some money, but if he is sold on the project, then it matter doesn't how ""attractive"" you think we are to players of his ilk, it's up to him. i can imagine a lot of young players heads are being turned by us right now because we are providing an excellent platform to get a lot of playing time and become super stars if they want it. we have a top 5-10 global following, so it's not like you won't become stupid rich and be famous worldwide because you chose liverpool over man u.

Yes, he needs a lot of work finishing but then you bring up Hendo immediately after this and completely ignore that he is a horrific finisher the majority of the time and has missed many sitters or even failed to put shots on goal that were wide open.

I don't share what seems to be your blanket distaste for anything postmodern. There's some ridiculous stuff being written in the name of postmodernism but also some very worthwhile stuff; there's a reason why researchers started bumping up against the limitations of modernist paradigms to analyze our current world. To each his own, I guess, but considering that postmodernism has played a pretty major role in academic research for a few decades now, it seems a bit paradoxical to say that you ""don't have any time"" for that kind of thing and at the same time blame feminism for not being ""willing to engage with the rest of the intellectual world"".

That's tangential though, I guess. More to the point is that I don't quite see how something being postmodern would make it ""extreme"". And that's the original statement I took you to task for: that feminism is ""becoming more extreme"". 

For example, you apparently disagree with the whole concept of gender. But the observation that ""gender"", as social construct, exists parallel to ""sex"" as biological entity isn't really particularly controversial anymore. The basic idea is accepted by global organizations and government institutions and in fields from psychology to social science. So it's not somehow ""anti-scientific""; if anything it's in part the result of scientific research finding that sex as binary construct of identity isn't adequate (think of [gender dysphoria](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gender-dysphoria/pages/introduction.aspx) for example). It's also hardly like biology could disprove the existence of a social construction of gender, alongside the physiological givens of sex, in the first place, even if there were biologists who wanted to go that way. So what about it is supposed to be ""extreme""? 

Finally, there is still the issue of how you choose to single out one or the other particular manifestation of feminism, and to studiously ignore the rest. Feminism isn't just blogs, it isn't just books, it's also about policy-making, activism, and community care. You can declare yourself ""uninterested"" about all those other dimensions of feminism, but then you can't really make any credible claims about how extreme ""feminist leaders"" are becoming anymore. I mean, how is a feminist academic who writes books any more a leader than a feminist Senator who writes bills? Yet you insist that you should be able to make claims about what feminist leaders are, or are not, like by looking only at the one, and ignoring the other.",null,0,null,1429640223,null,0,false,0,cqjvud9,null,t3_32sil5,null,t1_cqjvud9,null,t1_cqetyvt,null,null,null,1432520883,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt; His appointment as Group Chief Executive took effect on 1 June 2003. Shortly afterwards, in October 2003, HSBC announced that it would offshore the work done by its UK finance processing centres in Birmingham, Sheffield, Brentwood and Swansea to India, Malaysia and China within two years. The move, which represented the largest such offshoring in the financial services sector at that time and would lead to the loss of 4,000 British jobs   
...

&gt; In January 2005, Green became Chairman of HSBC Bank plc, the group's UK clearing bank subsidiary, and Group Executive Chairman in June 2006. In its July 2005 issue, Bloomberg Markets magazine reported that HSBC was allowing money laundering by drug dealers and state sponsors of terrorism; the magazine alleged that this had included a transfer of $100,000 in April 2000 to the Taliban in Afghanistan 
which had subsequently resulted in a fine levied by the US Treasury Department. Green denied the allegations, calling them “a singular and wholly irresponsible attack on the bank’s international compliance procedures”. Subsequent investigations however, confirmed that money laundering had taken place at HSBC for several years throughout Green's tenure as Chief Executive and Chairman, chiefly for the Sinaloa Cartel.  
...

&gt; In February 2015, there was further criticism of Green and his leadership of HSBC after BBC Television broadcast a Panorama programme entitled The Bank of Tax Cheats exposing the complicity of HSBC's Swiss private bank, HSBC Private Banking Holdings (Suisse) SA, in helping more than 100,000 clients from over 200 countries evade tax worth hundreds of millions of pounds. At the time of the alleged offences Green was the Swiss bank’s chairman.

If you're up for a night out, and if my memory serves, Tuesday is great for people of student-age on Broad Street (same large street that Cineworld is on!) with a string of decent (ish) bars which make up a good crawl (start at the bottom, stop when you find somewhere you like) and it really does have something for all tastes. I can particularly recommend Revolution as a typical tacky-but-basically-fine bar for shit music and cheap shots, or The Tap &amp; Spa (just off broad street to the south, about halfway down) for a more relaxed pub night. Selly Oak is Student Central and so can also be relied on for a more toned-down version of the same experience.


If Beer is more your thing, Birmingham has an absolutely shitload of Camra-loved pubs in all areas of the city and suburbs. My own favourites for both good, cheap (ish) and safe include the Wellington in the centre (just follow the road about 2 mins uphill from New Street station), Post Office Vaults (next to the PO opposite the town hall) the Junction and the Plough on Harborne high street, the Midland in bearwood and the Goose in Selly Oak. But really, google it and you'll be handed far more choice than anyone needs.


If you're strapped for cash, catch the rest of the evening while you can down by the canals (location permitting) which are really beautiful in pretty well all areas (though some are naturally more industrial than others) and we have more than Venice, donchaknow!


Somebody joked about the middle-eastern culture but in all seriousness you have on offer the best selection of curry in britain, Birmingham has a reputation for it's South-Asian communities and this seriously shows in some spectacular cooking- the smell walking through some neighbourhoods at around 5-6ish is often unbearably good. Moseley is a particularly nice area for a meal and a drink afterwards, if you're near there. You likely won't have to look far to find something in pretty well any area of Bham.

null,false,FloatableCat,null,null,null,"The issue with portsmouth is that in terms of people per sq Km it has a higher population density than London, and in such a limited space there isn't much you can really do about building new homes.

There needs to be an initiative to build upwards, more multi storey halls for students, more good flats etc.

The parking in portsmouth is a joke, and so is the parking scheme. I lived in south sea when they introduced the scheme in what was the MB area, some residents objected so instead of cancelling the scheme in that area they just excluded the two roads with objections, all the overflow parking went onto these two roads and so residents complained and the scheme was brought in.  Then a year or so later the council decided to remove that zone from the parking scheme!

What we need is a consistent approach that actually solves the issue, more incentive for students to leave cars at home, and a fair solution to parking across the city, not just in certain zones.

Also it seems stupid to me that portsmouth is so close to gosport and hayling yet there is no bridge. Sure it would be a huge undertaking but either a bridge or tunnel near gunwharf to gosport would make the area so much more accessible. The same with a bridge where hayling is close to portsmouth, students could then easily live in those areas as well and reduce the number of people in the city.

Can we really call Can / Markovic / Moreno / Origi / Lallana failures?  If even 3 of those 5 come good, which I think most people expect to a certain extent, that still puts the squad in a very solid position.  Even Manquillo has played well for a 20 year old who came to Liverpool from a foreign league with all of 6 first team appearances under his belt.  

Where I think the committee has absolutely failed is up top.  I don't really have an opinion of the Lambert transfer either way:  31 years old, great story, very low financial commitment, low expectations, etc.  Obviously, though, somebody lost the plot with replacing Suarez.  It isn't failing to replace possibly the world's 3rd greatest player.  It's failing to make a like for like exchange.  We need(ed) a player who can press for 90 minutes, run at players, and finish.  If that person managed 20+ goals, fantastic, but (to me) not absolutely necessary for top 4 in our system.

Still, people here act as if they support building through youth &amp; patience with one eye on the future.  The sentiment isn't that people understand it's a fiscal necessity to compete with the financial powerhouses, but that it's a model we're fully behind.  We've essentially lost our 3 best players from last season's title challenge (Suarez, Sturridge, Gerrard (with all due respect)) and we're 4 points off of 4th having made two semi-finals.  The fact that we're quite possibly a decent striker from a solid top 4 position is really pretty fantastic.

It doesn't go both ways.  you don't invest so heavily in undeveloped potential and dominate that same season.  5th is absolutely a solid result.  Disappointment is warranted; we should've won the title last season, and 2nd to 5th is never easy, but as this is the first season in a major restructuring (i.e. 9 new players) I don't see how anyone could have realistically expected more.  

I'm not saying the committee is a success.  I'm saying it simply can't already be an utter failure.

Year after year we see world class players make moves for less money than we spend on some average ones - that's not FFP's fault. 

It's not FFP that has stopped us from defending our title this season. 

Yes it's deeply flawed, and the fact United think they are better than everyone else because they happened to be on top when the money arrived is pathetic - but aren't you glad that we are now breaking even, and if Abu Dhabi pulled out, we wouldn't go bankrupt? 

Honestly I am, and we wouldn't be in that position without FFP. The money is incredible, and has done so much for us, but I prefer to see it as mostly an accelerant for the normal football club growth through increased revenue and fans.

If the SNP demonstrate that voting SNP can produce a *stable* UK Labour government - boom - what's Scottish Labour's purpose any more? It has no reason to exist and will be forced to 1) dissolve over a period of time due to massive infighting, or 2) become autonomous to differentiate itself from both UK Labour and the SNP (and I suspect an autonomous unit might be neutral on the independence issue or support home rule in order to win back voters).

He still has some flaws in his game like his (somewhat spotty) decision making in the final third and finishing/shooting.

These are problems that are typical for young players, and will improve as he gets more experienced and confident in front of goal. The perfect example of this is Coutinho, who at 22 is finally showing everyone that he can actually shoot well and score goals.

&gt;postmodernism has played a pretty major role in academic research for a few decades now

No, postmodernism does not have a role in scientific research.  Of course there exist pomo journals - but post-modernists have not and will not produce anything of any research interest to the wider intellectual world.  They're off in a little island by themselves and are simply ignored by actual scientists.  (I'm not trying to show-off, but I think it's relevant that I've got a PhD in physics.  I have some experience with what does and doesn't get published in serious academic journals.)

If so, then this is what we call an 'unfalsifiable theory' and so lies outside of science.  It's closer to faith.

Tadic is meant to be our side's prime creator, that means we need him to take the game on himself a bit, draw a player out, take him on and lay off that pass, or whip that perfect cross in, or any number of things that a player like Tadic has been doing for teams above us.  

Elia also hasn't quite got something atm, not that pace of flair that he had when he first arrived, and it's a bit of a disappointment because he provided us with a traditional winger which was good, and had direct running like Mané.

It's too easy to defend against, and either Koeman before hand or the players during the game need to find a way around that.

null,false,OptioMkIX,,"Who can I vote for if no one is offering ""FULL COMMUNISM NOW!"" ?",null,"Thought Id post this as it highlights a fantastically pony theme in modern british politics: that of hubris and contempt. 

We saw it last year with the Scottish referendum. The political establishment was so goddamn sure that the Scots would vote no, they treated the entire place with contempt - right up until that one poll was published showing that actually, it was nearly just as likely to vote yes. On the release of the news that Scotland could vote democratically to swan off into the void, the entire political establishment shat itself as one and organised the great Scottish road trip to try and persuade voters to vote no, the final week of the campaign being a pretty grim struggle with bribe, counter bribe and fearmongering on all sides.

And now we see a repeat. The Tories were so damn sure they'd done a good job of nailing a stake through Milliband's heart in the court of public opinion, they just didnt put the effort in. Now its becoming apparent that Milliband is in with a fighting chance, and so the Tories are ramping up their efforts to try and woo voters back. Last week it was the extension to help to buy, the announcement of new round of Right to Buy and in the last couple of days the opportunity to buy shares in Lloyds - provided you've got the cash, natch. In short this can be summed up as ""Vote for us, and we'll let you buy Britain."" I guess it appeals to a certain kind of voter.

Now apparently they're flying in some tossers from the States to help the campaign. In short, they're throwing the entire fucking kitchen plus sink at the electorate but Milliband is still steadily gaining ground now that the debates have shown him not to be the stuttering, malingering fool that a lot of the media have previously made him out to be.

null,false,frckls29,null,null,null,"**Name of product:** Aldi Biocura Aqua-Complete Multi Intensif Serum

**Price of product:** €5 for 50ml

**Where did you purchase:** Aldi Netherlands

**Product claims:** -

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV. Freckles and PIH from hives.

**Your opinion:** 
This seems to be a revamped serum of the same name by (Aldi) Lacura. This one no longer contains shea butter, macadamia oil and algae extracts and replace them with aloe vera and amino acids instead.

My skin recently got its moisture barrier disrupts from me trying to regularly using sunscreen again, yet not realizing that my skin has grown overly sensitive to avobenzone. Plus, the only ss I had in my stash without avobenzone has real high amount of alcohol, which didn't help with my skin in such state.
I was using SebaMed Clear Face Care Gel, but it too, irritated my fragile skin at the time and didn't help with the dehydration from the japanese Nivea sunscreen. It doesn't hydrate my skin the way I expected it to.

After my skin finally calmed down considerably (yet still dehydrated), I took this out of my stash drawer to give it a test. The texture is like a very light lotion and it has jasmine fragrance which although smells soothing, irritated the area around my eyes a bit (slight warming sensation). Other than that, I found this serum helps a lot to increase my skin's hydration. It doesn't have occlusive, so I layered this under the SebaMed gel, under a drop of sunflower oil patted all over the face before proceeding with sunscreen. I found my face no longer feels as parched, tight and crinkled, and started looking plumper and healthier.

The serum is housed in a frosted glass pump bottle with a twist lock and costs only €5 for 50ml. It looks classy and not cheap at all. One pump dispenses a perfect amount for my whole face, yet two aren't too much either.

My only gripe with this product is just the fragrance, thus I won't repurchase if I find something just as good or better at holding moisture (so I'd need less products in the morning) that is more sensitive-skin friendly.

[According to that Carl Gardener link I posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/33a3x6/ed_can_enter_no_10_without_nicolas_keys_barrister/) (and assuming my reading is correct), if Cameron fails to pass a Queen's Speech then procedure is that he resign and the Queen invite the leader of the next largest party or group of parties to form a government, without the need for a fresh election. It would only be once all possible opportunities have been exhausted that an election would be called.

&gt;If there is a ‘hung’ Parliament, with no party in overall control, the monarch invites first the incumbent Prime Minister to continue in office; if he is unable to do so, then the leader of the largest opposition party is appointed Prime Minister.

I don't know how long you've been a fan for, but I'm sure you are aware of just how average Liverpool have been before Rodgers. It was close to being a Leeds United situation under Hodgson. So after Daglish steadied the ship Rodgers has done a great job in creating something that will produce over a period of time. 

You cannot expect instant results, because Liverpool can't attract world class players and the owners clearly don't want to spend the money to change their mind. Mourinho wouldn't be able to change that, let alone Klopp. Seems silly to me to go through another transitional period, but i'm not the owner , so we'll have to wait and see.

Since then Bayern's final point totals each season have been 91, 90 and they're currently sat on 73 with five games left. Those two Dortmund titles are just as arguably Bayern Munich having dodgy seasons as they are Dortmund putting in some sort of exceptional title charge to better them. 

His Champions League run is only one or two seasons as well. He got to the final one year, and a quarter final another. His other seasons in Europe involved going out in the group stages of the Europa League and the group stages of the Champions League, and they went out in the second round this year. Can't really argue that all the other clubs in Europe flopped that year they got to the final - Dortmund played some seriously good football. But then so did we under Rodgers last season and apparently that doesn't save his ass in comparison to Klopp.

People talk about Klopp as some sort of young manager who has spent four or five years at Dortmund and instantly won everything there was to win against all odds. That's just not true. He spent seven years managing Mainz before he managed Dortmund (including getting them promoted and then relegated again a few seasons later), and his two league titles and a CL Runners-up has come from eight seasons at Dortmund. He's got a better record than most, but he's hardly got the midas touch for management that some people seem to attribute to him.

I don't think he's world class. At the very least his track record is nowhere near as proven as a manager like Rafa, who I'd say probably isn't considered ""world class"" either by most non-Liverpool fans, but who has at least won trophies on a consistent basis with different squads at different clubs.

They have been relying on their young talent to carry them and have made the playoffs two years in a row. When they have brought in big money talent it hasn't gone well. (See: Turkoglu, O'Neal) Their big name players have a history of moving on to bigger and better things for chances at titles (See: Carter, Bosh)

They brought in a player to control the game from point guard (Lowry), similar to how we brought in Eriksen, and he has been the linchpin of the team.

They will probably not win a lot of titles, but there will be excitement and pride in the youth.

It's not a problem for a party until you get splits in the ranks of the MPs and MSPs. We still seem some way off that (although 50 extra MPs ought to make life more interesting internally).

Like Salmond before her, Sturgeon is a gradualist. There's no point in rushing into another referendum. If she plays her cards right over the next 5-10 years (and there's no guarantee she will) then I expect the independence polling numbers will naturally swing in her favour. 

The next referendum really will be the last for a generation. I don't expect she'll go for it until there's 60% in favour in the polls. Until then, strategically, I expect it's better for the SNP to bide its time, let the Scottish Labour party strangle itself to death, slowly amass powers, and let the largest block of no voters pass on from this world...

FFA doesn't work as a proposition in the near future and, for another referendum to be called, the public have to be sold (or desensitised to) an economic plan involving a separate Scottish currency. So there's no point in going into another referendum unless that's been achieved first.

If she tries to manufacture strife at UK government level then the public will act against the SNP. I expect what we will see is more of a soap opera trope where people will continually accuse the SNP of trickery and dishonesty while it's doing nothing wrong (like we're seeing now in fact). Voters will get sick of the baseless accusations and the SNP will gain support.

Umm, a couple I think

Leather coat &amp; suit. Coat is practical, suit is for special occasions.

When they need cleaning. Which is rarely.

The situation under Hodgson was bad yes, but that doesn't mean we should be fine with that level.. Rodgers has spent £240m since coming in 3 years ago yet our results in all competitions are pretty much that of a mid table club right now.

Yeah for the money we spend we should be 5th etc, but that doesn't mean we should be so poor in cup competitions... and teams can also underachieve and overachieve.. look at United last season, us last season, City this season etc....

Klopp would help attract world class players, but it'll still be hard unless the owners break the wage structure which isn't going to happen.

null,false,reverent_irrelevance,null,null,null,"Well I mean, we played fine without Elia. And Elia has been a bench player. So he can't really be blamed for our failures. Nor can Tadić. He's done more in recent games than other players have. The ones I have the main issue with are Davis and Wanyama. They've looked completely off the pace and frankly short on confidence too. 

With either of them in the side, we are frail and clumsy in the middle of the park, and without that anchor in the middle, without that security, none of our lads want to BOMB forward. Except for Mané.

Which is why my point stands that unless we have our central midfielders performing like they were earlier in the season, finding space and stretching the opposition, Tadić, Pellé, Ward-Prowse, none of them will thrive in our system.

The only one that still manages a decent game when our central midfield is being shut down is Mané. He finds the ball during the second phase. When either a long ball gets knocked down by Pelle or back by their defense, Mané knows to press and collect the ball. Our central midfield is so disjointed right now, they seldom do that. 

How many goals this season have come after a second phase of attack? From collecting a loose ball in their half or making an interception halfway up the pitch? We are not strong in the middle of the park right now and that has crippled our attack and exposed our defense. I don't blame Pelle or Tadić at all. I blame our entire midfield currently revolving around Morgan Schneiderlin. And while he is excellent, he's not Pirlo-level good at dictating a game.

That's why he's repeatedly getting frustrated. It showed like hell against Stoke. He was alone out there in the second half, because Davis was completely absent and Ward-Prowse was played far too deep. That massive hole in the middle allowed Charlie Adam space. It allowed Nzonxi space. And I'm sorry, but Toby is not a central midfielder. He looked poor. Worst performance he'd had all season before he went off injured.

2. Minimal, maybe 2 on average, I can completely avoid it some weeks, 3-5 hours other weeks, but I like sewing (making clothes &amp; bags etc) and it's imperative that you iron your seams. I usually watch a film while I'm ironing, preferably something I've seen before so I don't worry about missing it, but nothing with subtitles, because I get distracted.
4. Karate gi, because the cheap, student ones crease if you breath near it, ballet skirt and leotard, nasty fabric that creases easily, shirts and blouses (as and when required), evening wear, because if you're going to make an effort, make a damned effort. Similarly with trousers (not jeans), skirts and anything floaty. Some dresses (especially at this time of year) look dreadful if you don't iron them.

1. Dunno. Lots. 
2. Mainly evening dresses, because they tend to be the elegant ones, one *good* suit, because it looks awesome, and an inherited coat made of mink (was my Nanna's Mum's and I don't wear it often, even though it's vintage, it's still frowned upon. (I know, I know, fur=bad, but this was a gift from her husband when my Nan was born and it's got sentimental value, I'm not chucking it out.)
3. About twice a year. To be honest, I used to work in the fashion industry (straight out of school, stupid idea, dreadful industry, made me the cynical bitch I am today) but it taught me to take the labels with a pinch of salt. There are a few items (suede jacket, fut coat, leather items, and a  velvet evening gown particularly) which I always take to the dry cleaners, but I don't wear them often, so maybe twice a year and I'll take a pile of things, all the others go in a delicates bag on a special setting on my machine. I didn't cheap out buying a washing machine though, I bought an expensive one which has a special setting for pretty much every eventuality on it, sadly it's not a Miele, but it's the best I could afford, and next time, next time I'm getting a Miele!

We're getting to the point where every Scottish constituency is SNP. Every English non-urban is Tory. Every urban is Labour. The LibDems have some of the mixed constituencies. The UKIP might show up in the seaside towns.

That's a false, inaccurate picture of the UK. It shows us as incredibly divided, when in fact we are not.

No matter where you are in the UK people vote tory, labour, libdem, ukip. Anywhere in Wales/Scotland they vote PC/SNP. 

If you look at the red/blue map of USA voting it's even more apparent. Some states are 45/55 and others are 55/45. If you watch US commentary you'd think it was 0/100 and 100/0.

What did bother me today and I should have put in my original post is that Sturgeon has no intention of another referendum and has all but said so. However the SNP have intentionally left it out of their manifesto. The only reason for that is because they think it'll lose them less unionist support than it gains them nationalism-above-all-else support - you know ""the 45"" type people.

I quite believe Sturgeon is a gradualist, however I believe that like Salmond she will want her referendum before she goes. Maybe Salmond was forced to have his early, but I do not think he would have wanted to step down without it.

What I also believe is that Sturgeon does not fully represent her party. She is the acceptable, pragmatic, practical, sensible face of Scottish Nationalism. There are still lots, and lots of bitter, nasty cretins who don't give a fuck about anything other than Scottish independence and see anything else as a means to that ends, and have no interest in good governance.

I know that you couldn't have got Alexis with us interested, but with the amount of Suarez money you had and fucked up a wall on average players, I reckon you could have easily got a difference maker player or two.

So, you spent £117m last summer on 8 players, and when it comes down to it, the way I think you need to think of it is ""Would any of these players get in Chelsea, City, Arsenal or Uniteds team?

I think Can for £10m was good business, he can become a very good player. £20m for Markovic I'm iffy on, not a big fan of him personally but he's young and I'm not a pro manager.

If we buy four or five fairly low-price players then we keep depth, and so long as we buy wisely enough and have a good development team, those players will at least maintain or go up in value and strengthen the total value of the squad.

Liverpool's current strategy has them hemorrhaging money, in smaller increments but given the number of players involved it is significant.

For example many of you lot suggest that Balotelli flopping isn't a massive problem because he can be sold this summer. However that means that Liverpool will have wasted 6-10 million pounds for absolutely no gain in less than one calendar year. Lambert, 5m squandered. Lovren, 20m down the drain.

However, that isn't to say that the strategy at a whole is the incorrect one for us to take.

People are apportioning blame to the transfer committee, while completely ignoring the context in which they're operating.

Sure, we made mistakes and with hindsight, you'd have wanted at least 1 different signing instead of one of Lallana, Balotelli or Lovren, but, while clubs that are already stronger than we are are outspending us massively or at least matching us, we're both subject to the lottery of the transfer market, but they're buying more tickets.

Every club is going to have head-scratchers - players that were a total waste, that failed to live up to the hype, or positions in the squad that weren't filled.

But when the players you're signing are averaging about less than those of your competitors (half as much in some cases), not only will your successes be worse than theirs, but so too will your failures - Di Maria would've been one of our best performers but has been unquestionably a failure this season given the price tag.

You could argue that we should only buy £30m+ players then but there's a host of reasons why we can't - they're not interested, we needed squad depth, a smaller number of signings represents a bigger risk because you're pinning your hopes on a small number of players staying fit and on form rather than spreading the risk out.

**Name of product:** Mentholatum Skin Aqua UV Moisture Milk SPF50 PA+++

**Price of product:** $5 for 40ml

**Where did you purchase:** Supermarkets and drugstores in Indonesia

**Product claims:** -

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV. Freckles and PIH from hives.

**Your opinion:** I used this a few years back since it was so cheap back in my homecountry and I just learned the importance of sunscreen in my routine.
It's a white liquid that feels very silicone-y. It has high shine and feels quite greasy upon application, but dries down fairly fast with no whitecast. It left my skin looking pretty shiny but leaning more towards dewy. It wear very comfortably, adequately hydrating and slightly moisturizing.

It also acts greatly as a primer. I wore this under Lucy Minerals powder foundation and people would compliment me for how great and smooth looking my skin is. They just blend together amazingly. I used to even wear this with just concealer or loose setting powder and my skin still looked great.

Unfortunately, this doesn't have the best protection as I see my freckles were just as strong as always. In fact, I got a few more during the time I was wearing this.

Even worse, ever since my skin started acting up more by being SD-prone, this no longer agrees with my skin (thanks to cyclopentasiloxane). It made my SD-prone areas looked like they have patched of floating dry skin (I really don't know how I can make that making any sense; fellow SD-prone people would understand) and it flared up my SD and PD.

For sunscreen newbie who don't have such finicky skin as I do, this would be awesome for daily city use (mostly indoor). Ergo, 4 stars.

P.S.: The one I used is the one being sold in Indonesia. It has slightly different ingredients list, having the ingredients in different orders, but still with the same actives.

Or just even the one in the place that you live, because most places will have a local football team. I know Man City supporters who were vocal Man City supporters before Man City got money- and they were loud and proud. Where I live, people were Derby supporters before they got into the league circa 2007/8 (iirc) and supporters even now. So... not really? My partner still cheers for the Bantams (small team from Bradford) and follows Derby. 

Back in the day, before Barcelona got Qatar'd, Barcelona used to be most people's second team, because they weren't so obnoxious then. They had a good mix of academy talent and South American talent, as well as promoting Unicef (they'd give a donation to Unicef every time they wore their shirts, for example). I think people started following La Liga in a big way when Ronaldo left Man United to go (and it was the biggest signing at that time, rah rah) and then Bale (British signing, biggest signing, etc) but it's one thing to follow Real Madrid and another thing to bandwagon, and I don't really get that in my neck of the woods at all. 

There's a nobility to curse the fortunes of your local team, I think. My partner refuses to watch the playoffs in the Championship if Derby gets that way, for example. My friend follows a wee team called Hartlepool - and he rocks the shirt and everything (League 2 team). 

I'd say what seems to be the hipster thing/middle class thing in the past few years is to support Bundli teams, especially when Dortmund was flying.

I never know these days. [The Orange Book Lib Dems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orange_Book:_Reclaiming_Liberalism) strike me as natural allies of the Tories and might prefer them over Labour, particularly given Miliband is in favour of some market regulation which might not sit well with more laissez-faire Lib Dems. Who knows.

&gt;What's remarkable is how little difference there is between 32/35 for lab and tories. 

The key difference is the total seats when you add up the coalition permutations. In [this model](http://may2015.com/category/seat-calculator/) Labour + SNP = 328 (a majority), Con + Lib Dem + DUP = 304 (no majority).",null,0,null,1429650085,null,0,1429650273,0,cqk2dwc,null,t3_33dwkx,null,t1_cqk2dwc,null,t1_cqk247r,null,null,null,1432524037,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

For example we can look at the risk/volatility vs return for the much circlejerked over vanguard LS 20% (20% equity, 80% bonds).

Over the last 12mo it returned 11.5% with a volatility of about 4.1%. Based on this, an investment over the next year could have a 97.5% chance of returning better than 3.3%, and an 84% chance of returning better than 7.4%

Over a 3 year investment return is 23% with 4.6% anual volatility, giving expected return over 7% at 97.5% confidence and 15% at 84% confidence, equivilant to 2.3% and 4.8% per year.

So you can see, investments can give a good return, but they do carry risk and you have to be comfortable with that. Investing over an appropriately long time period can help reduce risk by giving fluctuations to sort of average out.

I don't have a problem at all with the purchase policies we are operating under, but where I do think we need to do way, way better is identifying exactly what we need (in terms of positions, style of play, ability, etc.) in the squad and buying to that rather than randomly buying players for no discernible purpose.  

I don't think we need 'big name' signings, I just think we need the right signings.  Where are weak?  Where do we lack depth?  Where can we improve?  Do we have a player in the Academy that provide depth for a position or do we need to spend?  Those are the things we seem to do badly for me- the strategic side of figuring out what we need and plugging the gaps first and foremost rather than spending a lot of money (in aggregate) on players destined to be loaned out constantly or hardly ever play.  

Given our financial position relative to our peers (as you point out) it's even more important that we keep the screw ups to a minimum as we don't have the money to waste like the others might.

I also knew nothing about Moreno and expect more after the hype and, tbf, his stellar start through the Spurs match.  He did make a defensive error against City.

I'd be happier with Markovic if he was in the 12 - 15 range, but we basically had Sterling and Coutinho to play in wide positions, where I think Coutinho doesn't belong anyway.  So I disagree with his being unneeded.

I wasn't happy that we were pursuing Lallana, especially at the prices that were being quoted.  I'd have much preferred Salah or Shaqiri and, given the prices they actually moved for, can't see how Lallana's price wouldn't have bagged one of them.  Again, though, I disagree that he was unneeded.  Like I said, really only Sterling and Coutinho in his position.  If the plan was always to continue with the diamond, we wouldn't really need an extra number 10, but I think we always expected to transition to the 4-3-3.

Origi is hard to make a judgment on.  Decent price after a strong showing in the world cup.  You're right that his money could have gone towards a striker who'd contribute this season, but I think it should have been Origi *and* a striker to contribute this season.

I'd probably count Can as a CDM, but he never gets any time there so I'm not sure that's fair.  

Swap Balotelli for a better fit and I think it's a lot more like a solid summer.  We added a cb, lb, rb, cm, and a few ams/wingers (of which we really had just 2), all of whom look(ed) to have fairly high ceilings.  Lallana is one the I have the biggest problem with.

We need to buy a striker. That is obvious, willing to trust Bafe, (I want to believe he was just homesick). But Rory isn't going to pan out, and it is asking a lot of the youth strikers to step up as early as next year. So good depth is needed there and maybe Michu has gotten better ankles-like on a black market somewhere-and can hit some of his past highs. But since Scotland/Dobbie. Back up striker for Swansea City AFC is a black hole for form ( I maintain that when Graham played well Michu was a ten)

Next I think we need a lad that is fluent in French, seriously. If we are going to keep Bafe he should have someone to speech his own language with, when Bony left it's not hard to tell why he would feel very alone. I think this is part of the reason we wanted Stromboli last summer over another defensive midfielder. Part of the reason Montero is doing well despite not speaking much English is having a base of people that are similar culturally around him. When we got de vines and later Vorm, both said the were happy that there was a few Dutch players in the team with them. I think we over look that personal side of football too often. 

Fullback is the other spot where we need cover particularly if Neil decides he doesn't want to live in South West Wales his whole life. I know it is hard to take, but look at all the expatriates on this sub, it isn't an uncommon desire. Jazz taking a step forward, he is ready and could play ahead of Rangel right now tbh. Will help but a full time Left-back, has to be a priority in the summer.

&gt;

&gt;The __""Black spider"" memos__ are a series of [letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_(message\)) and [memos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum) written by [Charles, Prince of Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales), to British government ministers and politicians. The Prince of Wales is the eldest child of the British monarch [Queen Elizabeth II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II) and [heir apparent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heir_apparent) to the British throne. Traditionally, the British monarch remains politically neutral.

&gt;The letters are sent by Charles in a private capacity, but concerns have been raised that they may represent the exercise of undue influence over British government ministers. Charles has described himself as a ""meddling prince"". Issues that Charles has expressed views about in public include farming, genetic modification, global warming, social deprivation, planning and architecture. The content of the black spider letters is known only anecdotally and from memoirs and leaks.

&gt;In 2010, *The Guardian* journalist Rob Evans made an application under British [Freedom of Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information) legislation to see the Prince's 2004 and 2005 letters to ministers. After several legal cases the application was eventually refused by the Attorney General, Dominic Grieve in October 2012, and the case was the subject of an appeal in the Supreme Court, who in March 2015 ruled against the government's decision, and allowed for the eventual publication of the letters.

null,false,strolls,null,null,null,"I was recently disappointed to learn how Lord Ashcroft came to get his peerage.

Now known for his political polling, at the time of his ennoblement Ashcroft was most famous as a wealthy donor to the conservative party who had non-dom (i.e. offshore) tax status.

The Sunday Times ""rich list"" has rated him as the 37th richest person in the UK, and so he was seen to be buying political influence without paying his fair share of tax.

The scrutiny committee had denied Ashcroft membership of the lords a year before, so he inveigled upon Hague to put him forward again, on the basis that he would give up this non-dom tax status.

It's hard to say what went on behind closed doors, but the newspapers described him as having ""pledged"" this, and that he had made a ""gentleman's agreement"" that he would become a full UK taxpayer by the end of the year.

At the time the cabinet office released an official press release, stating that Ashcroft had agreed to become UK resident, with ""official guidance to the press"" that this referred to his tax affairs.

The Parliamentary Ombudsman subsequently stated that the ""political honours scrutiny committee were content to rely on undertakings given by both him and the then leader of the Conservative party [William Hague]"".

Ashcroft reneged on the deal, remaining non-dom for another decade, denying that he had ever made such an agreement and saying ""it was the cabinet office who made that statement, not me"".

There was to be a public enquiry about this, but it was determined that the role of the scrutiny committee was complete once the peerage was awarded, and that there was no way to rescind it, short of an act of parliament. 

Ashcroft retained his non-dom tax status for another 10 years, until a 2010 act of parliament required peers and MPs to be tax resident and domiciled in order to remain in Parliament.

During the intervening time, Ashcroft joked about the title ""Baron Ashcroft of Belize"" and used one of his Belize-based companies to pay for polling, thus avoiding VAT.

It's not clear to me whether Hague colluded with Ashcroft, telling him ""you just need to cross you fingers when you make the promise"", or whether Ashcroft realised on his own that he could get away with breaking it.

I think those alternatives are pretty much the most succinct way of describing what happened - this is a bloke who owns three of the largest superyachts in the world and who has a collection of aeroplanes, and he fibbed to a committee of old peers in order to avoid paying tax fairly.

There's been discussion today of how sleazy Grant Shapps is, editing his own wikipedia page and selling these shitty overpriced ""get rich quick"" books, but I can't help thinking it's just part of the endemic culture of the Tory Party.

It rings hollow to hear people talk about conservatism as the ""politics of aspiration"" and about removing barriers so that people to succeed - that only seems to make sense if they assume that everyone is as bent and grasping as they are.

Well, yeah. If your definition of a result is ""hoping to nick a draw"" then that basically is the case, and it pretty much always has been for any Liverpool side I've watched in the last 20 years. Even in 2008/09 when we came close to the title under Rafa and were playing good football, we still drew to Stoke, West Ham, Fulham, Man City (just before the money kicked in) and Hull at home, with three of those games ending 0-0.

If teams are happy to turn up and play anti-football (as a frustrated Mourinho has been known to call it), especially if they're practised at it, then it's not that hard to play for a draw. Best case scenario you nick a goal from a set piece somewhere and have a chance of a proper result, worst case scenario you narrowly lose a game you were never expected to win to begin with. 

We should be scoring goals in games like that and comfortably walking through, but Man City, Chelsea and Spurs all went out to clubs they'd be expected to beat. And it's not like Reading didn't run Arsenal incredibly close in the other semi-final either. Shit happens in the FA Cup, that's why people watch it in the first place. 

Also, back to your first comment, we didn't score a single goal at home in the FA Cup, but then we only played at home twice. And we scored seven in four away.

For me, Ibe/Alberto could have played the role of Markovic this season and Teixeira/Suso could have been the Lallana (or some combination thereof), although I wouldn't have personally minded either of the players you mentioned.

I would really like to see Can actually play holding mid as I think he would be a good one.  Strong, fast, reads the game well (for his age anyway), good on the ball, not afraid of getting stuck in, etc., plus I do think he could learn a lot from Lucas.

The words of Julian which I assume are the cause of her lawsuit (I can't see which other comment it would be):

&gt;I was really shocked at the suggestion that people with mental health problems should be expected to wear wristbands to identify themselves

She's trying to use this legislation:

You can see from the recently ended season that the team has a group of loyal fans and players that don't back down when faced with problems (injuries to literally EVERYONE). On another note, with all the Rose discussion here recently, it hit my mind that he really is like Westbrook in the manner that they don't give a shit about what people say and that they're just really hard workers and aggressive players.

Transfers have to be calculated and very well thought through. We aren't even near the best placed clubs to have our say when someone really good decides to change clubs. We are well placed to get really promising young players and that's our policy. Build for couple of years to be ready to rule the world later - that seems fine to me, I have time and patience. I would much rather see a group of younger players get older and improve together than just buy some group of ready made players. I like observing progress, but maybe I'm alone.

I agree now that Ibe could have played Markovic's role, but it'd have been difficult to say that at the beginning of the season.  I think he likely benefitted from the Derby loan.  Not sure where he was for the Villa game.  Alberto didn't show enough for me last season.  That's at least partially due to his limited playing time.  Not sure you can invest in youth only to limit them to 15 minutes stints.

Teixeira has looked solid for Brighton. Again, though, not sure that could have been counted on in the summer and think he's benefitted from the first team loan action.  I thought Suso looked pretty good whenever he was given minutes.  Wouldn't have been upset if the plan was to involve him more often and invest the Lallana funds elsewhere.

I think Can's ideal position is CDM, at least from what I've seen.  He provides decent cover defensively and bombs forward to great effect through the middle.  I think he's shown he isn't a wingback / rb and never showed anything to suggest he should be, at all.  I'm frustrated when I see him out there.  CDM lets him influence the game more while playing to his strengths (time on the ball, middle of the park).  When he receives the ball too far forward he's limited.  He isn't the player that stands up a defender and beats him.  He builds up a head up steam when he's allowed to turn into space and barrels past people.

He was poor last year (and hasn't really been any good for a long while) which is why they wanted him out even if they had to cut the price in half to do it.  

Know how many shots Balotelli took last season?  157 shots and he only scored 7 times from open play.  95 of those shots were from outside the area and he only scored 2 of those.  That's just awful.  By comparison, Sturridge took 99 shots total and scored 21 from open play last year.  That's excellent.  Granted that's not the only measure of success, just trying to show how poor he was numerically as the only YouTube clips you will find are the 14 of 157 shots that went into the net from him- no one ever shows the other 143.

As for BR, I have no idea why he doesn't play Lambert or Borini or even Mario.  I don't rate the guy at all, but there is no way Mario shouldn't be on the pitch more than he is when Sturridge is out, or if not Mario at least one of the other two.  That's ~£32M spent on those three and they can't get a start over a 20 year old winger (who Rodgers didn't buy).

You get the point. No team has won the league without a proper goal scorer. We needed to spend big money on a proper proven striker, someone who has a track record for goals.

Lovren isn't the problem. Lallana is a good player and will improve next season. The fundamentals are as I mentioned, a keeper, 2 goal scorers and some decent midfielders.

&gt;

&gt;___Dr. Who and the Daleks___ (1965) was the first of two *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)* films made by [Amicus Productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_Productions) in the 1960s. It was followed by *[Daleks – Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daleks_%E2%80%93_Invasion_Earth:_2150_A.D.)* The film features [Peter Cushing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cushing) as [Dr. Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Who_(Dalek_films\)), [Roberta Tovey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberta_Tovey) as Susan, [Jennie Linden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennie_Linden) as Barbara, and [Roy Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Castle) as Ian.

&gt;It is based on the second serial of the British science fiction *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)* television programme, *[The Daleks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daleks)*, produced by the BBC. Filmed in [Technicolor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technicolor), it is the first *Doctor Who* story to be made in colour and in a widescreen format. The television series continued to be made in black-and-white until 1969 and not in widescreen until the revival of the series in 2005.

&gt;The film was not intended to form part of the ongoing storylines of the television series. Elements from the programme were used, however, such as various characters, the Daleks and a [police box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_box) time machine, albeit in re-imagined forms.

At first it was just a tool that would screw and unscrew things by the use of (ultra)sonic vibrations. Later he was shown using it for more and more purposes: vibrating metal atoms to heat and melt things, detonating mines, welding or soldering circuits together and many many more. 

Over time the Doctor has added more and more functions and settings to it, so that currently it can detect a huge range of energy sources, and other signals, and can fix/break/seal or unlock just about anything, using the correct setting (and it has lots of settings). It seems to be a bit telepathic, when he uses it, but he has to tell his companions what settings to use before they are able to use it. Occasionally it will be lost or destroyed, but the TARDIS can produce another - and keeps a backup of the software that it uses running at all times.

It doesn't work on wood, though, or against dead-locks.

If we are to believe the mother invented the story and coached the kids, then we are to believe she invented a blindingly obviously flawed story which guaranteed her own downfall.

People tell lies and end up tripping themselves up down the line all the time. But the mother, if responsible, is supposed to have invented lies that she knew would be found out.

Details of the kids stories could be easily checked and their credibility tested. At the slightest investigation her story *inevitably*  unravels and all fingers point to her. 

What's incredible is the unnecessarily outlandish, fantastical nature of the story featuring unnecessarily specific names, specific details - it lends the whole thing a sense of credibility. The element of  ""*Why would anyone invent something like that*""... 

Or maybe she factored that in and that's why she came up with the crazy story she did, if she did - the idea that it sounds more believable when you've got real names in it.

Stilll - doesn't change the fact that she would have known that as soon as any claims were probed, she'd be in the spotlight.

So why do it?

Another explanation is that that there's something to the children's claims but it seems like the ship's sailed on that as a popular viewpoint.

&gt;

&gt;The __Royal Collection__ is the art collection of the [British Royal Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Royal_Family) and one of the largest and most important art collections in the world, spread among some thirteen Royal residences and former residences across the UK. It is the property of the monarch as [sovereign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign), but held in trust for her successors and the nation.  

&gt;It contains over 7,000 paintings, 40,000 [watercolours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watercolour) and [drawings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing), and about 150,000 [old master prints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_master_print), as well as historical photographs, tapestries, furniture, ceramics, books, and other works of art. It is physically dispersed between a number of locations of which some, like [Hampton Court Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Court_Palace), are open to the public and not lived in by the Royal Family, whilst others, like [Windsor Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Castle), are both residences and open to the public. Some of the artworks are in residences, like [Sandringham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandringham_House), which are not open to the public. [The Queen's Gallery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Gallery) at [Buckingham Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace) in London exists to show displays and exhibitions from the collection for several months at a time. There is also a [Queen's Gallery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Gallery,_Edinburgh) next to the [Palace of Holyroodhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Holyroodhouse) in [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh).

No club kicks you in the nuts better than Liverpool. On the verge of something one season, don't push on the next. Sell a key player, re-build. Wash, rinse, repeat. It's the same thing, over and over. Season after season.

I don't expect trophies every season. This isn't Spain where 2 clubs dictate everything in all comps. But after 3 seasons and serious money spent I expect something, as most fans should.

It's all very well and good having a young squad. You need experience and top quality players interspersed with that, this transfer window will be the same as last, those world class players will go play for a manager who has the respect needed to attract those players.

And of course Celtic wouldn't say it was intentional, they never do but they always have to ask someone for 'clarification' instead of just letting it go like most other clubs would. If it's not the SFA (Killie League Cup final, Hearts semi final,...)  then it's with UEFA for the game against Juventus.

There is also the argument of democratic accountability. A Lib Dem + SNP supported Labour government (of whatever form) will probably be able to claim majority support from across the UK.
