This also assumes that the consumer is ""right"" and government is ""wrong"" - is it to the benefit of society that people have more money to spend on plasma TVs versus improving said roads, when one primarily benefits workers in other countries versus workers here. Like I said, government tends to make bigger decisions for the longer term than your average punter. 

Furthermore it assumes that the economy is zero sum (or at full capacity, because otherwise nothing is being displaced as there is no idle money). If so then who cares, demand isn't shifting anyway, so the workers displaced by you not buying the proverbial pair of shoes can just get rehired to build roads.

**Price of product:** $125HKD (approx. £10) for 45ml

**Where did you purchase:** Innisfree store in Hong Kong, also available at [InnisfreeWorld](http://www.innisfreeworld.com/main/index.do) and /r/AsianBeauty has a retailer list on sidebar

**Product claims:** *""Long lasting sun block made from organic sunflower oil SPF50+ PA+++*

1. *It glides on the skin without a white cast while sebum-control porous powder keeps the skin fresh and soft*

2. *Mild care with 100% mineral filter protects sensitive skin*

3. *Sunflower oil and Jeju green tea extracts keep the skin in healthy condition protecting from damage by UV rays.*

*This non-greasy milky sunscreen applies lightly and easily without leaving any white residue behind.""*

**About you:** Combo dehydrated skin, prone to diet related break outs, sensitive to exfoliants, fair to medium skin tone that tans and doesn't burn.

**Your opinion:** This definitely works well in terms of oil control, but during Winter or if my skin is leaning more towards normal than oily it works too well and gives me an excessively matte finish.

Application-wise it's a watery lotion so measuring out the required amount can be tricky, I also find it leaves a noticeable white cast but trying to rub those away results in the sunscreen just balling up into white bits everywhere. Best to pat in thin layers and build it up but even then it's not guaranteed to not cause problems.

It has a herbal talc-like fragrance that does sort of linger about a bit but it's not a smell that irritates my nose.

&gt; What? I never made such an assertion. I only said the BOE has monopoly on sterling creation, and therefore can regulate it more effectively. They know how much money is in existence and are effectively the only people that can create more.

&gt; *A suitcase of unsequential £20's is not going to be traced.*

&gt; Could you please quote me where i have stated ""cash can be traced"". Stop strawmaning me or I wont reply k thanks.

But I think your arguments have far more fundamental flaws so we can move on.

Effective regulation is to protect the consumer not stop illegal activity, that is law enforcement. Effective regulation means that if I put my money in a UK exchange I am reasonably sure that it has good safe guards in place to protect my money. It also means that if a UK business wants to do business it Bitcoin they can use a Regulated UK exchange and know that reasonable money laundering safeguards are in place, just like a bank. It means that those exchanges file transactions with HMRC properly and everything is above board. If people chose to break the law then that is on them and hopefully the police can catch them.

I'll use the example of the drug codine, there are regulations in place about its production, supply and sale. This means that if I walk into boots with a prescription I am fairly confident that the drug they give me will be legal, safe and effective. If Boots buy it from a reputable supplier they can also be confident that the product they get is legal, safe and effective.

The regulation has been effective, it has helped me and it has helped boots, neither of us had to go exhaustive or detailed background checks on our suppliers, neither of us had to get a lab an independently check the drug before selling/using it. However if I buy codine from some dodgy guy in an alley or from the internet I am breaking the law, and I have none of those protections, but that is a matter for the police and it doesn't mean there is no point in the regulation.",null,0,null,1427128189,null,0,false,0,cpo26fx,null,t3_30054z,null,t1_cpo26fx,null,t1_cpo0r5o,null,null,null,1431966996,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

Alright, some people here think that just because people faulted him based on yesterday's performance, it means that they've forgotten what a legend he is. No one in their right mind is even remotely suggesting that. Gerrard is the greatest Liverpool player I've seen without a doubt. But there is no denying that he was a major cause, but not the only cause, of our defeat yesterday. The criticism meted out to him yesterday was correct and objective. If anything, giving him a pass for yesterday's idiocy would be subjective treatment solely because of his status. The fact that he accepted it shows what a leader he is, and we expected nothing less from him. But yesterday's criticism doesn't in any way invalidate his earlier contributions or his status at this club.

this is a different situation - where the people have perfectly healthy finances and simply lack a sizeable deposit. a few years a go they might have got a perfectly ordinary mortgage, but the crisis has changed the nature of the market requiring bigger deposits, or the value of the houses in the south east is so great that the investment might be sound but the size of the deposit would take a long time to acquire.

That said, their leader Abdullah Ocalan has specifically renounced violence, instructing the party at large to seek political solutions rather than violent ones. For fear of giving in to a 'good vs. evil' binary oppositional narrative, it's also worth bearing in mind that the difference between 'terrorists' and 'freedom fighters' usually depends on which side you're on, too. The French Resistance used violence, as have myriad other resistance groups pushing back against extremist or murderous regimes throughout history. Turkey has killed almost 30,000 Kurds since the mid-Eighties, and its oppression of Kurds is a long-standing cause of the halting of intended Turkish entry to the EU. I will make it clear that I am aware that the PKK's troops are ostensibly responsible for numerous deaths or crimes that ought not to have occurred. However I do understand Kurdish anger against Turkey, and maintain that at times it is wholly appropriate to violently resist and obstruct oppression.

The economies of scale really helps, for example it's one of the reasons why the NHS keeps costs so low versus private providers, because they can play hardball in a way private providers can't. High speed rail would be another example; it's something government has dragged its feet on but with the opposition and lack of short-term returns I don;t think it's something a private provider will ever carry out.

Here we have a player who has spent his entire life trying to smash Man U because of a searing hatred between the two clubs.

Then comes the game, everyone is fired up, the fans were loud and proud, we're given the chance to not only beat our fierce rivals but leapfrog them in the table and what happens? We're completely limp, no passion, no aggression, no local lads in the starting 11, no fire at all. It reminds me of what happened with United/Arsenal a few seasons ago. It lost the edge that made is a spectacle because Arsenal didn't have the local core that made it passionate, that made it a rivalry. 

I know it's the way the game is going, I know there's less and less chance we will see local kids come through,  yes, we'll get a few academy kids come through, oens that have been plucked from all over the country, but the local lads? Not so much.

*""If we were still an entirely sovereign nation we could of course tell anyone and everyone to get fucked whenever wanted.""*

It sounds to me as though you are advocating it, what else are you trying to say here?

&gt; Yes but we aren't talking about trade of goods are we? We are talking about foreign owned companies being able to buy up British companies, and by foreign owned we are talking about any company within EU or not. Can't be arsed to find you a source but it's common knowledge that the EU has quite a lot of legislation around restraint of trade. You can't just stop a foreign owned company buying another because you don't like who they are.

There are also reasonable grounds to block foreign companies buying nationalised assets. Such as security grounds, environmental grounds and even because of ""economic patriotism"" which is what France has used in the past to get a myriad of concessions on Alstom's takeover.

About three years ago, EADS (now Airbus) made a move to acquire the British company BAE. This move was torpedoed, not by Britain but by Germany. And why should Germany, an important partner in EADS, have been against this move? Apparently because it would have implied a move from Germany to Britain of significant parts of the resulting fused company.

One might also wonder about the ability of some multinational companies, such as Nestlé, to protect themselves from ""predators"".

Other commentators have already noted that the US has the power, which it uses, though granted on few occasions, to stop takeovers that it considers inappropriate.

So most countries take some measures to override takeovers that a free market would permit. The question really is where to draw the line.

They then overpay said friends family and underpay their vital staff.

End result is a company run by muppets, with a quick turn over of any decent workers, with only the shitiest of staff (who know they can't get more elsewhere) sticking around. Privatisation obviously fuels this fire, big time.

**About you:** Combo dehydrated skin, prone to diet related break outs, sensitive to exfoliants, fair to medium skin tone that tans and doesn't burn.

**Your opinion:** Ignoring how pricey this could get for an outdoorsy holiday it's my favourite physical suncream so far.

The texture is rather thick and you can definitely feel it on your skin as you apply it and leaves a slightly tacky feeling. But soaks in after a few minutes without a greasy or sticky feeling or any residue. It also doesn't ball up as you rub it in and haven't noticed much of a white cast.

Also works well under makeup due to all the silicones but not enough to replace a primer completely.

Despite being more for dry/sensitive skin my T-zone isn't overcome by oil after a few hours and my cheeks still stay comfortably soft. But oily people may find the initial texture too heavy anyway.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"It's not that different. All student loans between 1998 and 2012 had the same terms, all that happened was that interest rates changed, the loan amounts changed when they put tuition fees up, and the repayment thresholds and ages have changed a few times. Post 2012 the difference is that fees went up, the threshold was raised for repayment, the interest rates are linked to your salary, and the length of time for which it takes for your loan to be cancelled was extended.

&gt;Loans taken out for courses that began between September 1998 and August 2012 are repaid under the so-called 'Plan 1' variant of an income-contingent repayment (ICR) scheme.[22] Repayments do not begin until the April after graduation or leaving a course. Thereafter, repayments are fixed at 9% of gross income above a threshold,[23] shown in the table below. The interest rate for these loans is the lower of either the Bank of England base rate plus 1%, varying throughout the year, or the RPI measure of inflation, set each September to the value from the previous March.[21]

When people say it's cheaper, all they mean is that if you took a commercial loan for the same amount, the interest rate would be higher than for the student loan of the equivalent amount.

The time when your loan gets cancelled:
&gt;For loans taken out from September 1998 to August 2006 (August 2007 for Scotland): when the borrower reaches age 65

&gt;For loans taken out from September 2006 to August 2012 (England and Wales): 25 years after they became eligible for repayment

&gt;For loans taken out from September 2006 onwards (Northern Ireland): 25 years after they became eligible for repayment

Bentaleb plays as a holding midfielder, but has the quality to pick out a pass even under pressure and to shoot from distance. Mason plays higher up, but has the tenacity to get stuck in and hassle the opposition.

Capoue is a quality destroyer, but he can also play passes. This season, he put up better long passing numbers than Tom Huddlestone. And we've also seen him play probing forward passes along the ground. I can't help thinking the reason he's been dropped is personal, and related to the mutiny rumors from earlier, as Kaboul has also disappeared completely.

Dembele and Paulinho have been mostly one trick ponies (Dembele's dribbling, Paulinho's late runs into the box) but they don't get starting time.

As for Total Football: How many times have we seen Vertonghen or Dier make bursting runs forward *from the back line*, with Bentaleb covering their spot? Or Mason dropping into the RB position when Walker or Chiriches get caught upfield after overlapping?

Green MLA Steven Agnew says there remain barriers to cycling being used as a ""daily mode of transport, a commuting form of transport"".

He gave the examples of traffic, topography and the difficulty of bringing bicycles on trains as potential obstacles to cycling to work.

Mr Agnew says it should be ""one of our choices of how we go to and from work and go about our daily needs"".
/////////////////////////

then....

/////////////////////////
Regional Development Minister Danny Kennedy responds to the debate.

He recognises the committee's criticism of the draft cycle strategy as ""more of a statement of intent than a strategy"" but says the strategy provides direction, which needs to be matched with action.

His department is working with Sustrans, a charity promoting sustainable transport, to develop ""a Copenhagen-style bicycle account"" for Belfast.

Mr Kennedy says he supports the Cycle-to-Work scheme being extended ""as widely as possible"" and agrees it should be ""better and easier for people to join"".
/////////////////////////

then to conclude.....

/////////////////////////
Motion passes

The motion passes on an oral vote.
/////////////////////////

So I think we currently have a 'gentleman's agreement' that Mr Kennedy has the support of Stormont to push forward with more cycling infrastructure improvements. Visiting the website of Sustrans, they promote you to contact your local MP (or MLA), about what you want/will happen in your local area. I think that is a very polite way of saying hound them until they build something.

Gerrard is still a complete fucking moron for what he did.  I'm still in shock about it to be honest, it boggles my mind he'd lose his cool like that in 30 seconds over the kind of tackle you see come in fairly regularly in this fixture.  Deplorable behavior from the man we look at as the club made flesh.  Do I hate him now?  hell no, he's a fucking legend and will always be my favorite player ever, but he really fucking cost us a massive amount with this.

Their first goal was Moreno getting sucked in and not knowing Mata was over his shoulder.  Moreno in general had a real bad match yesterday, Mata tore him apart over and over again.  Shame he picked the NW derby as the game he forgets how to play football.

The second goal was rough because we were already down a man and trying to attack.  Sakho just had a giant pocket of space behind him there but if he drops back to cover it then it's basically like parting the red sea to let United in down the middle.  tough situation.

Sturridge's goal was really well taken, but he basically didn't fucking do anything all game before or after that.  I don't know what his deal is, but he seems way off from his old self, it's not even close.

Migs continued to look very impressive, I hope this loss doesn't rattle him because it really isn't his fault at all.  He even got fingers to Mata's first and nearly got enough on it to push it off the post and out.

we played shit until we went down a man, and because of that the game is largely our own fault.  Fair play to United, they were the better team on the day and got their 3 points.  The ref was pretty good too, didn't miss much.  I'm pretty pissed about 2 incidents though:

Jones trying to tear Henderson's leg off.  I get you go in hard in this fixture, but he was days late and had plenty of time to control his followthrough there.  He's absolutely wrecked Hendo and you can argue for a red there.  A yellow is probably appropriate as Jones wasn't really getting riled up before that and out for blood for a while, it was a pretty isolated incident.  Still though, I was really worried Hendo wouldn't get up for a minute, challenges like that hurt like hell and can cause some serious damage.

Rooney kicking Mignolet: Yes, Skrtel pushed him a bit, but you can clearly see Rooney's leg come out in a way and angle it really doesn't need to at all, there was definitely something in it.  I used to do things like this when I played if someone got under my skin because I always saw it as a clever way to get a nick in at them, but regardless of whether I used to do it or not I was always aware I'd see yellow or red if I got caught.  Stupid, stupid risk to take and I'm really frustrated Rooney didn't get caught.

I don't doubt that jobs would be kept in the UK, but developers such as MediaMolecule develop their games here with the profits held by Sony.

**Basics of EUMR**

*The EU Merger Regulation (“EUMR”) is articulated around the principle that mergers with an EU dimension, i.e., meeting certain turnover thresholds, have to be cleared by the European Commission. Article 21 EUMR provides that the Commission has sole competence to review such mergers and that EU Member States shall not apply their national competition rules in respect of these transactions.*

*The allocation of jurisdiction between the Commission and the Member States is, however, subject to a number of exceptions, and Member States may review transactions which initially fell under the exclusive competence of the Commission.*

*Thus, pre-notification, the parties may opt for a case referral to a national competition authority instead of notifying their operation to the Commission. Similarly, post-notification, notified cases may be referred from the Commission to a national competition authority.*

*Another exception is Article 21 EUMR. This clause provides that Member States can adopt measures which could prohibit, submit to conditions, or in any way prejudice transactions with an EU dimension in order to protect legitimate interests in so far as they are compatible with the general principles and other provisions of EU law.*

There is also a ""legitimate interests"" clause, a ""Recognised interests"" clause and an ""Other legitimate interests"" clause.

**Where did you purchase:** Watsons (pharmacy chain store in Hong Kong)

**Product claims:** 

* ""*Fine beige powder brightens up skin tone and covers pores for a natural finish that fits perfectly on skin*
* *Light in texture, it keeps skin clear for long hours and control sebum*
* *SPF50+ PA++++ blocks UVA and UVB, preventing sunburning, pigmentation and skin aging*
* *Enriched with hyaluronic acids and citrus essence to moisturize skin*
* *Watery texture that guides and absorbs smoothly*
* *Can be used as makeup base""*

**About you:** Combo dehydrated skin, prone to diet related break outs, sensitive to exfoliants, fair to medium skin tone that tans and doesn't burn.

**Your opinion:** As usual with Biore suncreams, the citrus extracts caused me problems and fragrance.

That aside this product seems a bit confused, it's a sort of BB cream but without the coverage, it's a facial suncream but the texture isn't particulary pleasant to use I can't quite describe it. It comes out a sort of mousse texture and has a streaky beige white cast as you rub it in but this does fade after a few minutes.

It leaves my skin feeling slightly tacky and smelling of powdery citrus sweets.

- It appeared to take Pochettino a fairly long time to nail down something resembling his starting back four. (It still appears as though he isn't 100% sure about his starting back four.)
- When he did there were injuries.
- When injuries came around, the squad defenders weren't ideal.
- When the first choice defenders had a bad run of performance, the squad defenders weren't ideal.

At left back, we have two dependable and capable choices. 

At right back, we have no other player to fill in for Walker when he's injured or playing poorly. Naughton could do the job, but obviously needed regular appearances. Fredericks will hopefully come good now he's had some loan development, as will Yedlin eventually.

Chiriches whether in the centre or at full-back is okay from time-to-time, but not an immediate choice for the starting eleven. 

In terms of our centre halves - Vertonghen, Dier and Fazio have all had good runs of form but always seem on the brink of conceding (or have conceded on 48 occasions). None seem to be team leaders especially. 

We need a Gary Mabbutt, a Sol Campbell, an uninjured Ledley King, a Tony Adams, a John Terry - a leader to build the central defensive unit upon. I don't really see the three mentioned above as being that.

It's good news about Kevin Wimmer, if true. Perhaps one more signing of that ilk would be significant.

null,false,DenningLJ,null,null,null,"Glad you got your reply, I'm awaiting mine, however, I do take some issue with the reply itself and unlike you appear to be I'm not satisfied with 'oh Dave said there's no point and we're all perfectly safe and politicians would obviously never mislead the public...'. 

A valid point of altering legislation is to provide certainty within the law, this would have done perfectly that. We all would have known where we stand and it would have removed any threat, this is a completely valid use of an amendment process when an ambiguity presents itself, hell, Ireland accidentally made a number of class A drugs legal and heterosexual marriage illegal through uncertainty of language the other week. Instead what they've done is worse than that. If an individual came forward with information for the purposes of this scenario then they would still be breaking the law, there is no defence. Prosecution aside, they've broken the OSA and that has the prospect of ramifications within the intelligence services that will affect any future access to information. 

Secondly, the CPS is ultimately independent. If they chose to go after someone for breeching the OSA, they could and there is very little the government could do once it's out there. The whole point is the CPS are seen to be totally independent of governmental interference, and yes, I know in practice it doesn't work like that as they are given direction by the government and ordered on budgeting and prioritisation, however, in principle the government can not be seen to tell the CPS who to prosecute or not prosecute. That's a very slippery slope. 

Thirdly, the government work and legislate for us and in our interests. If there is public unrest and an erosion of trust with the public, as there clearly has been here, and an argument of a possible conflict of interests within the government then they owe it to us, the electorate, to be doing all they possibly can to affirm their integrity. This would have gone a step towards that, this would have gained some public trust and shown some movement in the proceedings, giving the enquiry additional credibility. 

Finally, this all has to be seen from the point of view of the person sticking their bollocks on the line and coming forward. The government have had a chance to unambiguously give them legal protection and remove a barrier, a fucking huge barrier, to them coming forward and they /refused/ to do so. Worse than refuse to do so, they fought against doing so and whipped their MPs to ensure they did the same. The government have actively pursued the option to keep a threat of prosecution over these individuals heads, a threat to criminalise them and destroy their lives and that of their loved ones at any point in the future on only the promise of 'I promise we won't.' 

The cumulation of this as I see it is twofold. 

Firstly, it further erodes public trust in the proceedings, like it or not this is a very threatening measure. The government does not have public confidence at the best of times and this appears very very much that they are continuing to protect their friends and colleagues. 

Secondly, the government are actively disincentivising individuals with potential knowledge about historic child abuse from coming forward by failing to remove the threat of prosecution if they do and for many, the promise of 'we will turn a blind eye to you breaking the law' isn't enough, especially when they could have offered protection. If this stops a single person from coming forward, just one, then the government have failed the victims of this situation and more widely, they have told society that they care more about protecting their friends then they do about justice.

**Product claims:** *""Formula perfect illuminating serum is enriched with 4% vitamin C, plus a hydra care complex featuring moisture boosting hyaluronic acid. This silky textured and highly concentrated fluid delivers a reviving boost to the skin.*

*Made in the UK, not tested on animals BUAV approved.""* 

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased as I am curious about the hard-to-find AA-2G form of vitamin C and about M&amp;S own brand skincare.

**Your opinion:**  Smells very faintly fruity, texture is a super light lotion.

I rashly decided to use this instead of my L-AA serum today, thinking it would be gentler on ever-so-slightly over exfoliated skin. Cue tingling and blotches, progressing into a mild rosacea flush. Will leave for a week or so and see if this was a one off or if this serum needs to be relegated to neck only.

They will fix it the same they've always fixed it.

Those unemployed were not low skilled either they were craftsman and artisans of their time. Many went into empire building and fighting Napoleon. 

From then all the way until 1951 they had massive massive wars in order to cull the population. When it gets to the point you describe conscription will start and we'll have a massive infantry war with China over something like Taiwan. 

Think back to how Scots were used as cannon fodder for the British empire and suffered disproportionate casualties compared to other commonwealth infantry.

First off, as you state, the friend sat on your kid's knee. Arguably the friend's actions were the direct cause of the bed breaking. Even if not, and the shuffling caused the bed to break, then we move on to the next issue below. 

Even if your child has a duty of care to the owner of the damaged property, as a minor of 13, it might be held that the standard expected of her is not as high as it would have been for, say, you or another adult, and so she did not breach that duty of care. If there's no breach, there's no negligence and no claim.

Also, I'd say you have a pretty good argument that the bed breaking was not foreseeable, and again this would mean no breach of duty of care. If it wasn't foreseeable to your daughter, as a reasonable 13 year old, that the bed would break under the circumstances at that time, then there's no breach. I'd argue that the weight of 2 kids on a bed shuffling would not be foreseeable to an adult, never mind a child. And we're not talking about them using the thing as a trampoline. 

As you say, if it's the frame and not the slats it looks like there's a quality issue with the bed. Your child is not expected to know about that. Depending on the age of it the friend's mother should speak to the shop where they got it/the manufacturer, or home contents insurer. 

Also, even if (and it's a big if) there was a duty of care, and a breach, the friend certainly contributed to the bed breaking and the resulting damage, meaning your child wouldn't be wholly responsible. I don't think it would get this far anyway.

Then there is the question of who to claim these damages from. Generally parents are not liable for torts (civil wrongs) committed by their kids, so they'd have to be claiming for damages from your child, not you. They could only claim the money from you if you yourself had been negligent in not supervising your child at the time and if you should have done so. I don't think this is the case. If your child doesn't personally have the means to pay, there's no point in pursuing it. 

I don't think your daughter was negligent, and there's no legal reason to give her any money. I don't think any claim would be successful, and I would think that a solicitor would advise her of that. If you want to offer them something because you don't want the relationship between all of you to suffer then fair play to you, but I would make it clear that you are not doing so because of any legal duty to do so, and that you certainly aren't acknowledging fault on your or your daughter's part.

null,false,Leemage,null,null,null,"&gt;Turning Ursula into a sex toy as a consolation prize for Elton is gross and misogynistic as hell.

Erm. I definitely don't think that Ursula was created as a sex toy. She certainly was a ""consolation prize"" for Elton, insofar as they both were able to continue a mutual relationship. If Ursula didn't want their ""bit of a sex life"" she could just bite him. How many sex toys can say no?

Is their choice to have a sex life a bit gross? I know it does give me a ick factor but if that's what they want then who am I to judge? I didn't really get ""mysogyny"" out of it. 

Even without the sex joke, saving Ursula was a misstep (unless she could be fully restored) because Elton would never be able to move on and was stuck with a paving stone for the rest of his life-- he couldn't take her out for Chinese or have kids or even stroll in the park together. That's the tragedy of the paving stone debacle. Not because they are able to have oral sex. 

&gt;However, notice that we have no objective proof of anything that Elton is saying. The only stuff that is definitely happening is the footage that's being recorded by his video camera (the shot of SlabUrsula is over Elton's shoulder, in the opposite direction to his video camera). It's entirely possible that he's making the whole thing up and/or is completely deranged. 

While it certainly is from Elton's pov, I see no reason to assume it's made up or he is deranged. That just sounds more like wishful thinking by fans trying to fix a mistake. 

&gt;Certainly the crap Scooby Doo bit with the doors is supposed to suggest that it's Elton's telling of the story, not an objective view of what happened.

I loved the Scooby-doo bit. I could see that being exactly how they looked like to an outside person. Plus it's pretty traditional British humor. 

&gt;Either way it's the ballsiest episode of Doctor Who ever written, and I admire RTD's willingness to go nuts even if I don't always appreciate the finished episodes. Doctor Who was certainly less predictable under his stewardship, even if Moffat is tricksier.

I agree. It was such a unique episode.

null,false,parameters,null,null,null,"A few arguments used by both sides:

**Anti-Trident**

* Money saved can be used elsewhere. The UK spends billions on its fleet of SSBNs, when you consider the difference this money could make used for health, education, or infrastructure, it could even be considered morally wrong to use it on weapons of debatable use, and great danger.

* Removes the possibility of the UK being involved in a nuclear accident, potentially ending human civilization. The submarine crew are supposedly capable of independently launching the missiles, eventually this could happen by accident or malice. For all the supposed discipline of the submarine service, the probability of any event, no matter how improbable, is greater than 0.

* It gives the UK a moral high ground to help reduce proliferation, or even bring about disarmament in other countries. Trying to prevent other countries like Iran developing weapons technology is hypocritical when you hold desperately onto your own.

**Pro-Trident**

* Most of the money spent goes toward supporting the UK's ability to;build maintain and operate military ships/submarines. This needs many; skills, technologies and the ship-building industrial capacity which are globally rare, and very hard to develop from scratch in a short time. Unless you want to lose this, you will still need to spend money on a conventional navy to support this, meaning you can't actually spend the money on health etc.

* Nuclear armed states like Russia and North Korea do have a first use policy in case of feeling their homeland to be under threat. the exact circumstances for this are ambiguous, and the governments of both are not entirely stable. [It also appears that being nuclear armed has successfully acted as a deterrent in the past](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Days_to_the_River_Rhine#Nuclear_response), and it is not possible to put together a nuclear deterrent in response to a crisis unfolding over a scale of weeks. Maintaining it as a just in case is better than the risk of an unforeseen existential threat developing which we do not have the means to defend ourselves against.

* The UK's military spending is currently as cheap as it is because we are part of NATO, where the USA effectively underwrites the defence of Europe through article 5. However, the USA's interest in Europe has waned, and its frustration with European countries failing to pull their weight, has risen. The UK deciding to cheap out and effectively piggy-back on the US deterrent without contributing, may end up hastening the end of NATO, (and a distancing of the UK-US cooperation) and so, end the currently beneficial cost/security arrangements we have at present.",null,0,null,1427136532,null,0,1427140372,0,cpo7m1f,null,t3_30124z,null,t1_cpo7m1f,null,t3_30124z,null,null,null,1431969556,null,34,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,34,null

Sturridge goal? Thoughts on it? Is Sturridge back? Not really. This 3-4-2-1 does not suit him whatsoever. he had a great finish but either we switch to 2 at the tip or move Sterling back up there. something has to be altered as we looked dreadful up top yesterday.

Mignolet penalty save? How is his form? Migs is playing with excellent confidence at the moment. Could he have done a bit more on the first goal? possibly. But that's not on him much if you ask me. Moreno was out of position once again.

null,false,swug3,,Right Wing Conservative,null,"&gt; Its about 16% of Scotland's overall budget. A lot, but better with oil than without it altogether. No one voted Yes to be richer in Scotland.

Noble of you, but I thought the whole premise was that you would be richer in an independent Scotland. Financial instability of the bat isn't the best thing for a new country.

&gt; You have absolutely nothing to base your opinion on in this matter. The EU is obviously expansionist. They would never let 5M EU citizens leave, especially when they didn't want to. That's my opinion based on not much really, just the same as yours.

Here is what I base my claim on: 
Turkey: 

Massive pro- Opens up the EU to the Islamic world which is key for making the EU more powerful in world affairs. 
            
Con: They are really poor human rights

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union
 
It has taken nearly 30 years and Turkey still haven't joined the EU.

I am not saying that Scotland has poor human rights, but I am highlighting how complicated it will be for any nation to join. 

Croatia took 10 years to fully join: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_enlargement_of_the_European_Union

And a nation can block the entry, so A nation like Britain or Spain could block Scotland's entry due to Unanimity. It could take even longer.

&gt; Scotland can use the pound with or without agreement. Currency was was clearly the downfall of the Yes campaign. Whatever way you look at it Scotland would still have something...just what would be best?

Naturally the only answer is for Scotland to create their own currency or join the Euro straight away. These two have their own problems which you surely know what they will be. A Currency Union is a massive sell out in my opinion. As having control over Economic policy is the most fundamental part of independence. 

&gt; NATO could not operate without the waters around Scotland, Orkney, and Shetland. The USA were clearly worried about that. What would NATO do, allow an independent Scotland to be wooed by a Russian deal?

Scotland will get in to NATO faster than the EU I will concede that, but that's as you said, due to necessity, however, it will take time, that is something a new nation doesn't have. 

&gt; Trident wasn't welcome in an independent Scotland, but would probably have been housed here for the foreseeable future as a bargaining chip...possibly currency. There are many NATO countries that don't house nukes...England for one. 

Geography, Scotland is closer to Russia than the rest of the UK is. This means that if the event ever happened that Russia and the US start a nuclear conflict, the UK will have more time to react as the missiles will be closer.

&gt; Why would it be absurd for Scottish regiments to be Scottish? Scotland has contributed to the UK defence budget, and obviously would be eligible to the kit that it paid for.

The British army is paid for by everyone's taxes, everyone has a stake in it if you pay tax. Once you decide that you are not part of the group, you do not get the benefits from it. Splitting the armed forces is the worst thing that can happen at this time. 

&gt; Borders, like the one up between northern Ireland and Eire?

Now its back to the EU argument. NI and Ireland benefit from Schengen agreement. The rUK and Scotland wouldn't have that. And again, it will take years to actually get Scotland signed up, have a referendum e.t.c

http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/01/labour-and-tories-aren-t-same-so-why-do-voters-still-think-they-are  

The Tories and Labour have extremely different targets in their election promises. Labour want to cut the ""structural deficit"" (day to day spending) until it's a surplus, while Tories want to cut both that and the ""capital deficit"" (investment in assets) as well. Sound tedious and technical? The up shot of it is that the Tories are planning to cut £33bn, while Labour are planning to shed only £7bn (or 80% less than the Tories, in other words). 

What does that mean? On to the second source: 
http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/03/labour-could-end-cuts-next-year-and-still-meet-deficit-targets-says-ifs  
To meet Osborne's targets, the Tories will need to keep cutting at greater than the current rate until 2020. To meet Ball's target, cutting at the current rate austerity will be all done and dusted by 2016- next year. So Labour literally will be ending austerity in the next parliament, compared to Osborne who thinks he *might* be able to do it during the NEXT one after that (although he said that 5 years ago, and here we are today).

So in essence, the choice between Labour and Conservatives is a choice between austerity ending next year, and austerity going on for ""the foreseeable future"".

No. You clearly didn't follow the referendum very closely. 

&gt;It has taken nearly 30 years and Turkey still haven't joined the EU.

So completely different from expelling 5M EU mambers against their will then. There is even doubt if EU law would allow this. 

&gt;A Currency Union is a massive sell out in my opinion

It was a politically motovated ""solution"" to a problem that the Yes campaign had. It was clearly the issue that the campaign floundered upon. I tend to back a Scottish currency, we'll see what is presented next time ;) 

&gt;Scotland will get in to NATO faster than the EU I will concede that, but that's as you said, due to necessity, however, it will take time, that is something a new nation doesn't have

NATO can't afford a gap in their alliance for even a day...so with respect this would be automatic. 

&gt;Geography, Scotland is closer to Russia

Another reason why Scotland is vital to NATO, and why Trident in Scotland is an absolutely huge bargaining chip. Scotland could have ""demanded"" practically anything and been appeased to keep Trident here. 

&gt;The British army is paid for by everyone's taxes

Well said. Britain includes Scotland. We all get what we pay for. The SNPs defence policy was pretty robust, as a *defense* policy. It's the UKs that is dodgy. 

&gt;Now its back to the EU argument.

Indeed. Remember Scotland wouldn't have been independent the day after the vote. There was a negotiation period. The SNP said that it could be completed by 2016...most people think that was a wildly optimistic prediction. Maybe 2020 would be nearer the mark. Plenty of time to thrash out the EU membership. Believe it or not Scotland is worth a bob or two...the EU aren't as dumb as UKIP say.

Why does the BBC need to compete with the likes of the Daily Mail? We pay our license fee for quality journalism. If it's going to try and beat clickbait journalists at their own game, it's going to end badly. We pay the fee precisely so our primary news source isn't driven by lowest common denominator shitty yellow journalism whose whole purpose is to get clicks.

And even in that one small paragraph that deals with the actual incident, the main worry spelled out is that one of the people might get hurt by the car, as if Farage is the danger in this situation, and also that he is a coward for not staying and talking to the mob of people assaulting him.

Look at the language used in that one part describing the incident: *""just for a moment""*, to minimise it down to a trifling matter; *""Two or three activists""* like its nothing major, not even worth counting, barely even noticed; *""shouting teasingly""* as if he is a big-girls-blouse for not accepting a little 'teasing'; *""“What a coward!” says one woman. “He wouldn’t even stay to argue with us!”""*, what, with a bunch of people surrounding him screaming and shouting and denting his car? Yeah, what a pussy he is! He's shown his true colours ain't he! And then that's really all that is said about the interaction with Farage at all.

&gt; So completely different from expelling 5M EU members against their will then. There is even doubt if EU law would allow this.

Here is a clip from the Ex-President of the EU commission. So effectively head honcho for the whole EU project. His belief will be the same as Junckers as they are from the same TNPP. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebmfvA12ROs

&gt; It was a politically motivated ""solution"" to a problem that the Yes campaign had. It was clearly the issue that the campaign floundered upon. I tend to back a Scottish currency, we'll see what is presented next time ;)

Something we can agree on. The currency union thing was crap. I believe if anyone goes independent, you go fully independent. Everything else is a cop out.

&gt; NATO can't afford a gap in their alliance for even a day...so with respect this would be automatic.

No no, it will take years. I think you underestimate how much legal business there is to NATO.

&gt; Another reason why Scotland is vital to NATO, and why Trident in Scotland is an absolutely huge bargaining chip. Scotland could have ""demanded"" practically anything and been appeased to keep Trident here.

With respect, no party will back down on Trident in the UK. Other than the Greens. Its not a bargaining chip for the Yes campaign. Its something that is indefinitely going to be there, whether you Scots like it or not. 

&gt; Well said. Britain includes Scotland. We all get what we pay for. The SNPs defence policy was pretty robust, as a defense policy. It's the UKs that is dodgy.

The UK's position is clear, You are part of Britain, you pay for collective security, once you stop paying, you don't get the benefit.  

Having a policy based on the fact that the UK will give us soldiers because we paid for it is a weak one. What if the Scottish regiments want to remain British, You are expecting the Armed force to become political which is the worst thing to happen.

&gt; Indeed. Remember Scotland wouldn't have been independent the day after the vote. There was a negotiation period. The SNP said that it could be completed by 2016...most people think that was a wildly optimistic prediction. Maybe 2020 would be nearer the mark. Plenty of time to thrash out the EU membership. Believe it or not Scotland is worth a bob or two...the EU aren't as dumb as UKIP say.

The EU commission might not be dumb, but the nations inside the EU have their own national interests.

For example. Spain would never let an independent Scotland in, due to the Catalonian problems they face.

The arguments can also get very very picky. I.e. Greece won't allow FYRoMacedonia to join the EU over the name Macedonia. Because Alexander the Great, to the Greeks, is Greek. Acknowledging the name ""Macedonia"" would concede that Alexander the Great was Macedonia.

5 years is also very optimistic, I would be looking at 10 at a push. As the EU would want to see whether the country is economically stable to join. As they do not want to accept a weak member and risk the entire Eurozone.

No, because he is on the England National Team and they don't want to ruin the reputation of English players.

I agree Mourinho has a right to complain. I also agree there is bias. My issue where I  disagree is this view that it's exclusively against Chelsea which is what Mourinho argues. Why do I hold this view, well its related to disagreement on your comments  that

&gt;why now that they have had time to write all this up is there not the same uproar

There is no uproar against Skrtel or Gerrard as it wouldn't generate the same number of views and therefore money as Costa. People already hate Costa so when he does something bad they will triple the coverage. But  why don't I think this is  bias against Chelsea? Because if Ballotelli did what  Skyrtel, or Gerrard did they're would have been far more uproar than even if Costa did that.

We already have evidence of this view  in the uproar when Ballotelli swapped shirts at half time, compare it to the uproar (or lack thereof) when Ozil did the exact same thing. This suggests that media coverage will vary based on PLAYER NOT necessiarly CLUB. 

&gt;The question posed to carragher would have been vastly different, if it was terry being sent off and costa stamping 

Partially agree, I think the coverage would of been minimal if Terry stamped,  as he's English see lack of coverage for Cahill's stamp [here!](https://mtc.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/EFD14D64961162514369591259136_3bca0e1fcdf.1.4.2586154930647302037.mp4?versionId=yem8uUsSCOogPdNX2TeEIzqnFLUGwOFP). 

I agree  question would have been different for Costa, but don't you think the question would be different if Balottelli stamped? Or say if Ronaldo (who is generally respected but not loved) did a stamp compared to Messi?

In summary the questions/severity of coverage asked will vary depending on player, with the key variables being:
1)Nationality (English players get easier time)
2) Ability ( Better players get easier time e.g. imagine reaction to Messi stamp versus Colback)
3)Reputation ( Players perceived is arrogant, lazy, malacious will get harsher coverage e.g. Messi stamping vs Barton stamping)

This makes me feel there is bias unfortunately against certain players, but NOT clubs.

Contains only the world’s finest lanolin. Dermatalogically tested. All Lanolips products are animal cruelty free.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because my skin LOVES almost anything with lanolin.

**Your opinion:** Despite the fruity names the tinted Lanolips all smell sweet or perhaps of honey. Rhubarb barely shows up so I would not repurchase, Apples gives a light red tint, Mulberry looks scary in the tube but is a lovely soft berry shade that is my go-to for every occasion. The tints are *slightly* less silky and *slightly* more sticky than the Lemonaid, but still superior to any lip gloss I have tried. A little goes a long way so every tube lasts forever. 

Lanolips is the only brand I use: both for regular balm (the untinted/ no SPF Lemonaid) and as make up. [Mulberry] (http://www.adorebeauty.com.au/lanolips/lanolips-lip-ointment-with-colour-spf15-mulberry-limited-edition.html) was originally a limited edition and is now exclusive to Australia but I have three, I love it that much!

I don't know, I might disagree on this also. Just a couple weeks ago *Ronaldinho* put Terry in his all time XI. So it clearly isn't even limited to Chelsea fans, let alone diehard fans.

Yup..ex president, and with an axe to grind with regards Catalonia. He is entitled to his own opinion, as is everyone...simply the EU wouldn't want to expel 5M EU citizens, and probably can't.  

&gt;The currency union thing was crap.

Yes, a compromise that suited nobody. Want to be independent, then be bolder I'd say. 

&gt;I think you underestimate how much legal business there is to NATO.

If Putin saw NATO shun Scotland for even a day, what do you think that he would do? He wouldn't be doing his duty to the Russian people if he didn't act to offer Scotland a deal. Its would never be taken...I don't think...but a hell of a worry for NATO. They simply couldn't have this, even for a day. 

&gt;With respect, no party will back down on Trident in the UK

We are talking about an independent Scotland, not the UK. Get these boats out of our independent waters now...or lets talk. Politics. Any independent nation has the right to expel these boats. 

&gt;The UK's position is clear

No share of debt without a share of assets, remember that? Cool, keep the assets then Scotland starts debt free. Obviously debts and assets would be shared in reality. 

The Scottish government were to allow every individual serviceman to decide whether to serve for r/UK or i/Scotland.  There would be years to recruit and equip. 

&gt;Spain would never let (in) an independent Scotland

The Spanish government stated officially it would not stand in the way of a democratically independent Scotland. Yes, it would be a problem for them, but they will simply never allow Catalonia a vote! 

There is no direct comparison anywhere in the world for our union of governments in the UK, and so there would be no precedent set should it dissolve. 

&gt;As they do not want to accept a weak member and risk the entire Eurozone.

An independent Scotland is far from a weak nation. Scotland is not too poor to be independent.

null,false,Eisenhorn_UK,null,null,null,"&gt; Are you suggesting that if trident is scrapped, all the theoretical and practical knowledge, that is required to build and maintain nuclear weapons would suddenly disappear?

I think you're unaware that the weapons themselves are only part of the issue. You'd face the following problems:

1. The actual missiles themselves that lurk darkly within the Vanguard subs are provided by the USA. If we scrapped Trident and returned them to the States then we'd have a hell of a time getting them back again. And if the USA refused - thinking us now unreliable for some reason - then it wouldn't be the case of the UK having to remember how to build a reliable, compact, long-range under-water-launchable missile; we've not ever actually done this ourselves. This would have to be R&amp;D from scratch. And that would take *years*.

2. The missile bodies are American but the warheads that go in them are fabricated and maintained by UK staff at AWE Aldermaston. If you killed off  Vanguard then these people would be immediately redundified. So a while down the line, when you decide that all of a sudden you need Trident again in a hurry, tough. You've pensioned all these folk off. 

3. The same applies to the men &amp; women who design and build the hulls of the submarines, and of everything that goes in them. Any one of the subsystems that gets squished within a Vanguard hull - everything from its sonar and its communications to its toilets - is specialised to a horrendous degree. And submarine warfare is a bit like F1 racing - if you're 5% worse than the rest of the field you won't lose 95% of the time, you'll get the shit kicked out of you 100% of the time. If you're dusting-off a shipyard to try and build one of these again then good luck producing anything that isn't the underwater equivalent of a clown-car.

4. Don't forget that submarines need crew. Apart from the fact that it takes a rare type of sailor who can get on with life underwater at all, you need to train these sailors up to a pretty high standard, and keep them match-fit. Even making the enormous assumption that we'd keep our other nuclear attack submarines in service after losing Trident you can't just transplant a whole crew from one boat to another and think that they'll know what they're bloody doing.

The key thing, though, is that even if you could pull the plans for the reactors, the missiles, the warheads, the wiring, the plumbing, the computers, everything like that out of a filing-cabinet AND that you had enough high-grade steel and uranium and cabling of the right sort to start making them AND you had a shipyard &amp; factories AND you had a crew AND you could pull all of this together without making your new enemies dangerously irate, well, you're still fucked, because in the ten or twenty or thirty years since you sent your last Vanguard to the scrapyard you're now ten or twenty or thirty years behind where the rest of the world is in terms of naval technology.


tl'dr: you're right to say that it's not like turning off a light-switch, but only in the sense that it's actually worse; at least when you turn off a light-switch it doesn't actually get darker.",null,0,null,1427144052,null,0,false,0,cpoclp2,null,t3_30124z,null,t1_cpoclp2,null,t1_cpoa4dg,null,null,null,1431971977,null,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23,null

Disagree, if  we use google search results as a rough proxy, Costa stamp received roughly 4-5x as much coverage as this incident, suggesting the media didn't kick up a fuss about it. 

&gt;Plus you also don't see that O'Shea kicks Costa from that angle, but he does, which is why he runs off before the ref arrives.

I do see this hence why I wrote before ""Even if he was provoked by O shea."" 
It would help if you read my comments carefully before calling them ""bullshit"". 

&gt;We are talking about the media not about what players got away with

Wrong. What players get away with is very important as the two are directly linked.  Why is Moruinho  been complaining about  the media if what players get away  isn't important to this discussion? Well  because the medias  coverage affects what players do and don't get away with. Costa got away with this, which suggests that Chelsea HASN'T been exclusively targeted i.e. Chelsea have been victims of incompetent referring not systematic discrimination. 

I feel like this
&gt; don't want to ruin the reputation of English players. Also Cahill has always been a player

Contradicts your view their is a campaign against us. Surely if there was a campaign against Chelsea then Cahill would have been destroyed to? Maybe the media just doesn't like certain players, hence why Balotelli gets disproportiante coverage for an incident any other player does e.g. Ozil shirt swap vs balotelli shirt swap.


Your logic is flawed here. 
&gt; how wonderful a player he is with Sky Sports always waxing lyrical about him.
&gt;slapped around on all papers

The logic flaw is twofold

 1. Because your talking about two different entities 
a) sky sports in the case of ryan giggs and
 b) newspapers in the case of Terry 

You'll find that sky sports also love John terry, always saying he should be back in the national team etc. There is therefore no difference in treatment in Ryan Giggs, and John Terry. 

Your second logical flaw is comparing two different scenarios, and complaining why coverage is different. 
Scenario a) contains 1 premier league footballers and 1 unknown brother. 
scenario b) contains 2 premier league footballers 
Scenario B will always get more coverage in newspapers, as it's 2 premier league footballers (See Mario lopez and Icardi for a proxy) and the fact that Wayne Bridge refused to shake his hand, and left the England Squad.

Yes, and those specific terms include the fact that any future Government can make modifications to the current terms. In particular, they can change the earnings threshold and the percentage of your income that you pay over that threshold.

Rothschilds gave the government two potential values for the loan book - £12Bn if T&amp;Cs were changed or a ""synthetic hedge"" was introduced to guarantee profits, or £2Bn without any changes.

Cable ruled out T&amp;C changes but was still supporting the sale and the £12Bn figure as late as June 2014. Suddenly in July 2014 he halted the sale, claiming that it wouldn't reduce government debt and estimating the actual income at around £1-2Bn, the figure without any incentives.

The synthetic hedge option always required approval by the ONS - the government can't generally claim that an asset's been sold if they're still liable for costs based on it.  My guess is that Cable was told that the ONS would not consider it to be a genuine sale.

Even if he got cold feet for other reasons, the fact remains that in order to achieve the £12Bn figure in the budget, the government has to either:

* Promise to hand over an unknown amount to private investors over the next 30 years to guarantee their profits; or
* Raise the interest rates to commercial levels or find some other way of making the loan book more attractive to investors (such as converting to fixed term loans in order to make the income stream more predictable)

The first option is going to annoy every single tax-payer in the country, the second will annoy around 3 million people in a demographic who generally don't support the Conservative party anyway.

Finally, when this idea first appeared in the Autumn 2013 budget statement, it included the phrase ""The interest rate charged will remain at the Retail Prices Index (RPI) or base rate plus 1%, whichever is lower."".

**About you:** Combo dehydrated skin, prone to diet related break outs, sensitive to exfoliants, fair to medium skin tone that tans and doesn't burn.

**Your opinion:** This is a chemical filter only suncream, there is titanium dioxide but it's so far down I'd consider it there for colouring reasons.

Unlike the majority of Asian suncreams this doesn't start off with a bunch of silicones or alcohol so it goes on rather greasy and you will look shiny while waiting for it to sink in. It's also a watery lotion texture so you either measure it all out on your palm then hope to God you're fast enough so it doesn't run down your arms or face while you apply, or do it gradually in small sections.

It smells ""fresh"" not minty but more green garden, no problems with it balling up, no white cast either, can't comment on the oil control claims as I wear makeup and powder anyway. But definitely not amazing enough to warrant the RRP!

I think countries like the UK and France (and by extension Europe) can actually be quite moderating influences internationally, I can see it being slightly more possible that things could heat up if nuclear weapons were further consolidated into only the superpowers.


I very strongly support nuclear disarmament, but that needs to be worked towards together and honestly I don't think we'll see real progress for many decades, we need to wait until Russia and China mainly stop their fast development phase and even out politically.

The most important thing to our offense is to put passes together quickly and dynamically; a short one-two is one of our most potent weapons. Eriksen has fantastic instincts to know exactly where the ball should go whenever he receives it, and he's a master at placing a ball in the path of a run just outside the reach of a defender.

The United States clearly demonstrated a use for nuclear weapons during WW2 - vaporizing a non-nuclear power into submission, causing their early surrender and saving the lives of potentially *hundreds of thousands* of American troops. On the other hand, Japan clearly demonstrated a *need* for a nuclear deterrent. If Japan could've retaliated in kind, I don’t believe the United States would've nuked Japan, or would've even considered invading the mainland.

 I think that’s why we need a nuclear deterrent. If we decided to scrap Trident and there was an all out war with nuclear power (which we couldn't predict if it would happen in 5 years, let alone 50), they would merely need to threaten to nuke London, Manchester or Glasgow to force our surrender. But, being able to retaliate with Trident (even if we're just bluffing) would significantly raise the cost to them.

null,false,noggin-scratcher,null,null,null,"&gt;1) Does this overall plan seem sensible?

Broadly, sure. Getting started is more important than fussing over the minutiae of adjusting exactly how you allocate your funds. Sounds like you're aiming for diverse/low-cost trackers, which sounds like a good plan to me, exactly *which ones* you pick is less significant.

Well, I guess the returns could be different, but more by chance than anything else.

&gt; 2a) What is a tracker, exactly? b) Is it the same as a fund? c) And a mutual fund?

A fund could be almost anything, a tracker is specifically a fund that aims to track an index, (e.g. a particular stock exchange or grouping of shares - FTSE100, S&amp;P500, whatever) typically doing so automatically so as to cut down on management fees. 

They don't necessarily have to actually own all of the stocks in the index they track, but that's the easiest way for them to ensure that the return from the fund matches the index (the difference between the two is referred to as ""tracking error"", and a fund with low error is preferable... although identifying which one that is can be tricky).

&gt;4) When I enter Vanguard LifeStrategy 100 into https://halifaxiweb.digitallook.com/funds[2] , it comes with two options. ""Acc NAV"" and ""inc NAV"". I cannot seem to find what the difference is between the two?

Accumulating funds (Acc) will take any dividends paid out by the individual stocks and automatically reinvest them. Income funds (Inc) will pay that out to you as income to do what you want with (possibly including reinvesting them back into the fund)

&gt;I was looking at the help to buy ISA, which I think would be very beneficial if I was planning on buying a house several years down the line. The main downside I see is that it uses up my subscription for the year so I would not be able to start the S&amp;S ISA?

I'm not *certain* but from what I've seen about it, it sounds like it counts as your one Cash ISA for the year, but you were always allowed to have one of each (Cash ISA and S&amp;S ISA) per year, so I imagine that would continue to be true.",null,0,null,1427147425,null,0,1427147649,0,cpoeqn9,null,t3_301wvs,null,t1_cpoeqn9,null,t3_301wvs,null,null,null,1435445894,null,4,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,4,null

Then these two drunken idiots, both of them girls, walk by us a few times, and every time they've got something cheeky to say. We shrug it off. Pair of drunken slags isn't anything to get riled about. Call 'em cunts and move on. Lol. It did rub me the wrong way a bit though. Who goes into someone else's pub and acts like a fucking prat like that? Plain rude. But I kept it civil.

Except later we are stood outside after the game (which we lost rather horribly) having a smoke and out they come and start talking shit as they walk to a taxi. So I just call 'em cunts again. This big lad that was with them didn't like that though, gave me a warning and told me to cool it. I told him to do the same with his friends and that would have been it, until he went and said something cheeky about the game and how we lost it as he was getting in the taxi. I don't know who stopped me, the bouncer by the door or one of my friends, but I just flew at 'em.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;2) What is a fund? 

A source of money that will be allocated to a specific purpose. 

&gt;2) What is a mutual fund?

An investment vehicle that is made up of a pool of funds collected from many investors for the purpose of investing. A mutual fund's portfolio is structured and maintained to match the investment objectives stated in its prospectus.

&gt;2) What is a index/tracker fund?

A type of mutual fund with a portfolio constructed to match or track the components of a market index, such as the S&amp;P 500 or FTSE 100. An index mutual fund is said to provide broad market exposure, low operating expenses and low portfolio turnover. Can be known as either an index or a tracker fund.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;4) When I enter Vanguard LifeStrategy 100 into https://halifaxiweb.digitallook.com/funds, it comes with two options. ""Acc NAV"" and ""inc NAV"". I cannot seem to find what the difference is between the two?

[This article](http://monevator.com/income-units-versus-accumulation-units-difference/) briefly goes over the difference between accumulation and income fund variants. It seems that in your case the accumulation fund is probably the one you want.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;5) Whichever of the above from q.4 is correct, I assume that all I have to do is to buy shares in this fund? As simple as that?

Pretty much. Choosing which funds you want is usually the hardest part.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;6) I was looking at the help to buy ISA, which I think would be very beneficial if I was planning on buying a house several years down the line...

&gt;Skrtel charged by FA for stamp on De Gea. Three\-match ban likely. Right decision, just like it was right to charge Costa. Stamping is vile.

If you're doing 40hrs with paid breaks, you'll be picking up £260 a week before tax, which, off the top of my head, gives you about £230 after income tax and national insurance. That gives you around £950 a month to play with. 

In Edinburgh, you can get an OK flat in an OK area for around £500/month. Council tax is another £100. Your bills will likely be around another £100, which leaves around £200 for transport (£51 a month here for a bus pass), internet (£20ish), and mobile (£15). I've been sloppy with my maths, but it leaves you roughly £115/month for food and drink and everything else, which isn't much.

Chelsea dominance was mainly having the ball around the attacking midfield area (i.e. Ramires not having it). Hull dominance was due quite largely to direct passes into space which bypassed the midfield - how is he supposed to interecept them?

I think there is a lot of Ramires hate, but he's still a decent player. However he needs a team to play well with if he's at the BPL title chasing level.

It must be acknowledged there is a certain level of irony here, Farage complaining that people chased him out of somewhere while saying things he didn't like. It sounds extremely similar to the official UKIP policy.

If you are the head of a party which spouts a lot of rhetoric which is clearly insulting to a huge portion of the population, I find it incredible you would be so irresponsible as to go for dinner in a situation where your children could end up being scared by a crowd. If you are on TV saying foreigners are here stealing benefits, don't be surprised if some of them might want to say something back - and do what other politicians do, reorganise your life to deal with it.

The DM role is one of the most underappreciated roles, because if you fuck up, you have backup from the defenders. And you rarely do a lot of attacking play. Your main jobs are to win the ball or be the linkup between defense and attack.

And those jobs are essentially the only way to win the midfield battle.

I'm also not a big fan of the white navigation bar at the top either.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/231N6Wx.png), I quickly changed the colour of the header bar to the one they use for the TV graphics, and made the navigation bar black, personally I think the design suddenly looks far better.

Edit: It's pretty annoying that they've moved all the regional news to a subsection on the UK page, before within the header bar there used to be direct links to Welsh, Scottish, English &amp; N.

Thatcher is emblematic of neoliberalism and, at a time when the opposition were means-of-production socialists, she believed that the government had no business building houses.

Thatcher held the loony-libertarian belief that all property should be in private and the free market will sort everything out.

She believed that supply-and-demand would address any problems with the housing market, a belief which has been disproven.

I can't say that Cameron &amp; Co. disagree with her - I suspect that they're just trying to buy votes, but I don't know for sure.

Coincidentally, I spent two years in St Andrews a few years ago (dropped out of an undergrad degree) and am now hoping to start at Surrey in September (another attempt at undergrad study). 

Guildford, the town in which the University of Surrey is based, is really great. Guildford itself has everything you could possibly need, it's got lovely rural surroundings and is also within very easy reach of London.

However.

St Andrews is a very special place. It's difficult to convey exactly what makes it so special, because I think it's the unique balance of lots of different qualities that makes it so e.g. the architecture, the pubs/cafes/restaurants, the tradition and history, the beaches, the general atmosphere, the academic reputation, the proximity to Edinburgh... I left because the course wasn't for me, and unfortunately the subject I now want to study is not offered there -  otherwise, I would happily return.

In regard to Glasgow, I'm ashamed to say I've never actually been there. The city is supposed to be diverse and interesting, and the university itself has a pretty good reputation. 

Edinburgh. I have spent a lot of time there and absolutely love the city. I would imagine it's the perfect situation for your program too because the arts/culture are very prevalent. Academically, it is slightly less prestigious than St Andrews but it still has an excellent reputation. The only thing that concerns me about Edinburgh is this : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-31796418   Edinburgh is so accessible from St Andrews anyway, so there would be plenty of scope for spending time there even if you chose St A's. 

I think I've made it apparent that, from my perspective, St Andrews is the winner :) But you've got 3 other great choices as well and I'm sure you could be happy and successful at any of them. This might be one of those situations where you have to follow your heart and make wherever you decide to go the right choice by working hard and enjoying yourself as much as possible!

Cutting investments in assets to promote growth to me to be the most insane part of austerity, and Labour are not going to do this anyway.

This is a big deal - it means Labour fully intend to end austerity in the next parliament. And it wouldn't take five years - to meet their target, if they keep cutting at the current rate, austerity would be ended by 2016 - next year. I don't think left of centre people realise that this is what Labour is proposing at this election. It really shows how misleading the 'they're all the same' narrative is.

If you are already aware of this, sorry for the rant. But the only way I could see Labour softening their stance on austerity further would be an immediate unilateral rejection of austerity, which I really don't see happening.

**Best Player?** That's up for debate, personally, I'm loving captain Jose Fonte at present. He's been with us for years from the depths of the Football League

**Biggest Need?** Well we just lost our goalie, and super Kelvin Davis isn't the best of backups around

**Highlight vids?** YouTube Matt Le Tissier, aka Le God. He's the epitome of Southampton FC

**League:** Barclays Premier League. The top league in England. Bottom 3 teams get chucked out and promoted teams come up. Top league positions determine whether teams are good enough for European competition, either Champions League (the best) or Europa League (still pretty good). These are played alongside the Premier League, and we are fighting for qualification this year with our league position. (We haven't played in European competition since 2003)

**Songs/Chants:** ""Oh when the Saints go marching in"" is the classic. Most of the others are variations of classic football chants you pick up whilst following. Some good individual player chants too, don't really know how to describe them.

**Abbreviation:** The Saints is fine

**Jersey:** Go for a name, then when you look at it a couple years from now, you'll be extra happy with memories of that player. Players leaving happens a lot in football, and it can be amicable... not always though *cough cough Lallana, cough

**As for good videos:** Just watch a bunch of games if you have the time, it's pretty simple. Our last famous trophy win was against Manchester United in 1976 in the FA Cup, you can watch that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vv9-Dxqoys), we were huge underdogs.

Essentially if public spending is too little then the economy quickly hits the buffers as there is not enough infrastructure to grow. Think isolated Siberian/Kazakhstan cities, I've been to plenty. The roads in are awful and were challenging on an off road motorbike which I took. Therefore there is no reason to build a factory or anything there because you can't get materials in or out.

OTOH

When public spending is too high the state crowds out the private sector, those that do exist seek to suckle at the teet of the government. Companies like Serco or G4S which before the cuts pretty much relied entirely on government contracts. Secondly in order to fund such high public spending taxes have to be high which destroys incentives to generate wealth. We see this in the poverty traps of the tax system.

I certainly have seen the fund examples, it mostly got me a little more confused at the time as I thought I'd narrowed myself down to a bunch of Vanguard funds.  Would you be willing to share your fund choices?

Yes I looked at the help to buy ISA but Monevator seemed to poo poo it a bit.  From a bit more reading it seems worth a punt anyway so I probably will put money into it alongside investments.

I'm lucky in terms of finances, I will be keeping emergency savings out of investments and in high value current accounts.  I am also lucky that my parents are retired and middle class, if something happened, they could cover me and be confident I will pay them back.  Still I have about 10k accessible so should be fine on this front.

I'm unsure what you mean about treating it as a bonus?  Just use it as a High yield type portfolio and attempt to market time?

Thank you for giving a crap about my post, I appreciate you're looking out for my best interests.  Please know I'm not putting everything into investments, I just want to max my ISA allowance for S&amp;S ISAs at the moment.

You're right about the mental costs, it is annoying as usually I'm not such an idiot but I just can't shake the feeling.  I need confidence in my decisions and right now I don't have a great deal.

I did start conversations with an advisor but I thought they'd probably just try to convince me on their active management and keep things abstract which isn't what I'm after.  Still you're right, I don't know until I actually do it so might be worth sorting that appointment.

I'm in the last year of a degree in Environmental Science. The Green party has come up in discussions with course mates.The general feeling is that the Green party is made up of people who don't understand the situation and are bizarrely anti-science, with two critical major technologies - Nuclear and GMO - slated for banning. Why is the Green party so against these technologies? Please provide sources, not ""because they are bad."" Meanwhile, the party advocates wind farms, which, while less damaging on macro, they have known detrimental effects upon the local ecosystem. Most of the faculty that have spoken on the topics are pro nuclear and GMO. Why does the Green party listen to the scientists on the general topic but ignore them when it comes down to the details, if not hysteria?

on other topics:

* Why does the Greens advocate shrinking the military?

* why does the Greens advocate the open door policy for migrants?

* Why would you take us out of NATO?

&gt;MG102 We are aware that, in the 21st century, there is likely to be mass migration of people escaping from the consequences of global warming, environmental degradation, resource shortage and population increase.

&gt;PP102 'Carrying capacity' is the term used to describe the population that can be sustainably supported in any given region. It is not a fixed number but depends on consumption patterns.

&gt;PP107 Long-term trends in population size are proper 
considerations for public debate and government policy in order to plan housing, health, education and other needs.

&gt;MG300 We will work to achieve greater equity between the UK and non-Western countries. In step with this, we will progressively reduce UK immigration controls.

* knowing this, why do you advocate allowing increased migration, when that will put the resources available to Britons under strain? You admit that public resources are going to be strained by higher population, you admit that there is going to be a large amount of migrants heading towards the country, yet your migration policy is to allow MORE people into Briton. Why would people vote for a party that openly admits its going to jepodise their living standards?

Going on from this, why do pretty much all your policies on migration revolve around reducing border controls and letting more people in? you must know this is going to be unpopular to many, and you openly admit it will put great strain on the resources of the state. 

This also links in to the economic growth issue. If you want to allow migrants to arrive in large numbers, then how do you expect the country to support this new population with a stagnant economy?

They can expel, because Scotland on its own is not part a of the EU. Britain is part of the EU. This is where I think a lot of the confusion comes in. Britain has signed up/opted out of the various legislation, None of the stand alone nations have deals with the EU. That's why we send British delegates, commissioners, Eurocrats, MEPS. 

He was the president at the time of the vote, and it will looks like the EPP will be the president makers for a while. 

&gt; If Putin saw NATO shun Scotland for even a day, what do you think that he would do? He wouldn't be doing his duty to the Russian people if he didn't act to offer Scotland a deal. Its would never be taken...I don't think...but a hell of a worry for NATO. They simply couldn't have this, even for a day.

Yeah he would do that, but it would be up to Scotland to decide whether they want to do of those deals with a homophobic war monger. Which I think Scotland wouldn't. Scotland don't get special treatment, Scots will not get treated differently to any other nation. You will go through the same process as everyone else.

&gt; We are talking about an independent Scotland, not the UK. Get these boats out of our independent waters now...or lets talk. Politics. Any independent nation has the right to expel these boats.

You see, Trident can be used both ways. If you want Trident out of your waters fine, but you pay. You pay for having the costly movement. Since its your nation that doesn't want it. So, what will it be? Or we have a referendum on it here in the r/UK and decide for ourselves whether we like the agreement that the I/S and the r/UK came to. That's fairness.

&gt; The Scottish government were to allow every individual serviceman to decide whether to serve for r/UK or i/Scotland. There would be years to recruit and equip.

You said in an earlier post that you'll take an economic hit, fine, but how are you going to pay for the your version of the NHS, Free state education, Armed forces, Everything really with less money.

I wouldn't want to pay taxes knowing that it will go to an independent Scotland who just needs to sort itself out. I had no say in the referendum and I damn well won't pay for the repercussions. 

&gt; An independent Scotland is far from a weak nation. Scotland is not too poor to be independent.

Neither is France and look how well that is turning out for them.

&gt; Yes, a compromise that suited nobody. Want to be independent, then be bolder I'd say.

That's what I think annoyed me the most about the Yes campaign. Its like they wanted an independent lite, which doesn't make sense, you might have just asked for Devo-Max.

I'm also not saying it was moral, or legal. 

What I am saying is that you can't deny that there's an almost overwhelming majority feeling in Crimea that they have a right to be Russian if they want to which is being denied them by the Ukrainian government (and the constitution of said government). 

That's what the 1994 referendum was all about; the right to hold Russian AND Ukrainian citizenship. This was denied them, which has led to bitterness and a general willingness to be involved in the uprisings now.

The general point I was making in reference to the Falklands is that they voted to remain a British territory (or dependency or whatever they are), so any arguments that the Russian government make about it being rightfully Argentine only hold water if the Falklanders had voted to become Argentine citizens, and then had the referendum they took part in declared illegal, on the grounds that ALL of the UK should vote in favour of an Argentine Falklands/Malvinas.

null,false,havetribble,null,null,null,"&gt;The dispute made headlines once again earlier this month when a Drogheda printing firm refused to provide invitations for a civil partnership on religious grounds. The couple who placed the order said they were shocked, as one of the men had been a customer at the firm for four years.

I think this is where it becomes more thorny. The issue with the Asher's Bakery case is that they were creating something with a message, advocating a political belief, and I don't think people should be forced to produce something supporting a cause they disagree with, regardless of my own personal beliefs. Conflating this issue with the case of the Dublin printing company makes it much trickier. In this case, is the fact that it is a civil partnership the invitations are being requested for a political statement, when civil partnership is legal and the product is devoid of a deliberate message? I would say it isn't, but where would the dividing line fall in the Equality Commission's future decisions of whether or not to pursue a case?

That's why we differentiate between printing and publishing. The former is just putting ink on paper (or, in this case, a cake). The latter is endorsing the message of the ink.

It is the unpopular opinions that need protection in law. I recently needed some stuff printed for Faith and Pride (somewhat related to this case: [you can read it online](http://faithandpride.org/2015/03/09/support-religious-freedom-support-same-sex-marriage/) if you want). We sent the PDF to a printer, and they sent the printed material to us. The printer didn't care what the message was. They weren't endorsing it, they weren't saying they agreed with it. They were just printing it.

Suppose the first printer we went to had decided they didn't approve, and I had had to go to a second printer. Suppose they didn't approve. We'd have to find a third, and hope that they approved. If we could't have found a printer, we couldn't have got our message out. There would have been de facto censorship.

Fortunately, the law protects us. The law has long distinguished between printing and publishing, and more recently has provided non-discrimination protection.

This is bad as China is a land of famine (there is a book written about 100 years back whereby China has had a famine every other year for 2000+ years). As such the population would spiral out of control above the carrying capacity of the land.

So gigantic conquests of neighbouring states occurred. The victors and losers alike where then put on public works projects and worked to death like the Great wall 1+2.

You can look through the lists of battles for nigh on 3000 years there has been a war every 2-5 years using massive numbers of troops with massive numbers of deaths and civilian massacres. Things like the Taiping Rebellion caused 20-30 million dead more than WWI.

I specifically think WWI was a population cull exercise. The very fact that British infantry were ordered to slow march into German machine gun fire and told to hold guns to their chest to show British resolve. A tactic that was found to be completely ineffective yet was employed right up until the end of WWI in order to maximise allied casualties.

I might have mentioned this before, but one of the profs at the Surrey school is also interested in the study of the nonhuman animal and I *might* go on to do my PhD in a combined creative writing/critical animal studies field. So it would be beneficial to ""leave the door open"", so to speak, in that regard. Guildford does seem really nice and I like that it's close to London.

*But* from everyone I know (""know""=people on reddit, haha) that has gone to St Andrews, they've described that you said. That it's ""something special"". It does seem really unique and hold many cool traditions. Plus the architecture/general vibe is amazing.

Also, if you have American Express in another country you can easily create an account in the UK using your credit history in another country.

Another thing you can consider is British Gas reports payment history (and is apparently the only one to do so), so you might consider switching your electricity/gas to them.

Well, a fraudulent referendum definitely is suspect.

&gt;What I am saying is that you can't deny that there's an almost overwhelming majority feeling in Crimea that they have a right to be Russian if they want to which is being denied them by the Ukrainian government (and the constitution of said government).

Considering that Russia had been blaring propaganda about how  fascists in Ukraine were coming to power and about to really fuck over the region for being too Russian, its not surprising that people weren't too enthusiastic about being in Ukraine. Build into that that the invasion by Russia into Crimea scared off pretty much anyone that was passionate about Crimea staying in Ukraine, its not terrible surprising that support for maintaining the status quo wasn't too high.

&gt;The general point I was making in reference to the Falklands is that they voted to remain a British territory (or dependency or whatever they are), so any arguments that the Russian government make about it being rightfully Argentine only hold water if the Falklanders had voted to become Argentine citizens, and then had the referendum they took part in declared illegal, on the grounds that ALL of the UK should vote in favour of an Argentine Falklands/Malvinas.

I suppose but i think a closer analogy would be that if a significant population of the falklands were Argentinian, where Argentina had been been taking advantage of political instability in the UK to try to turn the populace against the UK.

I just don't understand how you can justify sending none but the most violent and notorious female criminals to prison. 

Am I to understand that you would therefore put in place two separate sentencing guidelines for criminal law?

Do you just believe that a prison type environment is bad for women and they should be 'protected' from it? I'm not saying that male and female prisons should necessarily operate in the exact same fashion, but the underlying custodial/community sentences have to be equal. Otherwise there is no equality under the law in the country (whether or not equality under the law exists right now you could debate due to prejudices of juries or judges or whatever, but you are seeking to enshrine that inequality into the law through legislation which is pretty dangerous and a step back in my opinion.)",null,0,null,1427154909,null,0,1427155780,0,cpoj997,null,t3_3026ob,null,t1_cpoj997,null,t1_cpois91,null,null,null,1431975184,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

As if Asher's are the fucking victims here. Absolute disgrace. 'Ohhhh, we're not allowed to discriminate against people based on their sexuality...'. And, let's be clear, this is exactly what's happened here. 

This is the 21st century. People now have the right not to discriminated against based on the colour of their skin, their gender, or their sexuality. The Christian Institute survey is fundamentally flawed, because it presumes that Ashers are the ones who have been discriminated against. The comparative examples offered to survey respondents illustrate this perfectly: we have an environmentalist refusing to work with a fracking company, Muslims refusing to produce pornography (note that this is a classic fundamentalist tactic: whenever possible, equate gays and gay marriage with something unsavoury like swearing, stealing, or porn), catholics refusing to produce abortion literature. In each case, we have someone standing up for their beliefs. But we also have another party - the ones requesting the service. 

In each case (except the Ashers case) the requesting party isn't being discriminated against. People don't have rights not to be discriminated against in their pursuit of images of Mohammed, pornography, Young Earth Creationist viewpoints, or homophobic t-shirts. People do have the right not to be discriminated against in their search for equality on grounds of sexual orientation. That's the key difference here. Ashers have every right to make a mountain of cakes proclaiming their support of traditional marriage. What they don't have the right to do is discriminate.

It's sickening that Christian groups both portray themselves as the victims, and place the people they've discriminated against in the same category as pornographers. Ashers don't give a shit about biblical marriage - I'm sure they don't check that any cakes they make won't be used by women with braided hair, wearing silver, who have been divorced etc. The line has been drawn, not coincidentally, around gay marriage, because it's one of the betes noires of fundamentalist Christianity at the moment. 

Also, if you support this kind of nonsense, do the rest of us a favour and fuck off back to the Dark Ages where you belong, and see how you fare there without all these ridiculous liberal-socialist-secular-humanist (or whatever inanely perjorative spin you want to apply) laws keeping us equal. Even better, fuck off back to a time when Christians were genuinely being persecuted so you can get a bit of perspective on the matter.

&gt;Not against GMO's, as in, the Green party would not ban them.

FA720 states The Green Party supports a moratorium on the use of GMOs in all agricultural systems. A Moratorium is effectively a Ban. Either way:

&gt;[We’ll only agree to the planting of GM crops, the release of other types of GM organism, or the marketing of GM food or feed products, if a robust risk assessment indicates that it is safe for people and the environment. GM product applications should be assessed for safety on a case-by-case basis, taking full account of the scientific evidence.](https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-the-food-and-farming-industry-more-competitive-while-protecting-the-environment/supporting-pages/genetic-modification)

The UK already has some of the strictest standards on GMO in the world.


&gt;The Green party would ~~also~~ bring in legislation that makes any company liable for any damage caused by GMO products they produce.

Updating the ELD is overdue.

&gt;We are not for free borders right now, this is a long long term policy that we will not see in our lifetimes.

According to your policy's, its medium term. And your parties short term polices all advocate massivly increased immigration - MG400-MG454 (i.e. every single Migration policy).

&gt;back to their country of origin. If we build toward a better attitude toward immigration not just in the UK but around the world, immigration will be more evenly spread out, instead of just focused in places like the UK

This seems naive and idealistic. Britain has a very high standard of living. You admit that right? Why would people leave this country to return to a country of a lower standard of living. There may be a few who return, but we are talking policy not specifics. The I really don't see how you make the jump between making immigrants more welcome and this somehow equating to a balanced population. 

And none of that answers my question, which was *why should I vote for a party that will jeopardize my living standards*. 

And moving from a purely practical debate to a moral one, why should we open our borders to everyone? What is the benefit to us? We don't need a influx of unskilled migrants, the Green Party itself acknowledges that that will cause a strain (PP107), but the Green Party says that skilled migrants should not be given priority over unskilled migrants (MG205). Skilled Migrants will be allowed in anyway under the proposals from every other party - even UKIP's point based system will allow them to migrate.

'Hun' is not an 'oblique' reference to germanic protestantism nor is it sectarian.


It has two definition which are related:
 
1. a member of a warlike Asiatic nomadic people who invaded and ravaged Europe in the 4th–5th centuries.

2. a German (especially during the First and Second World Wars).

Germans were referred as huns not because of their protestantism (they were at war with a predominantly protestant country and crown: Britain) but because of concerted propaganda which likened German agression and expansionism to 'a warlike Asiatic nomadic people who invaded and ravaged Europe in the 4th-5th centuries.'


In a similar vein Rangers fans used to actually call celtic fans huns. Why? Because they saw Irish Catholicism as having come to Britain and, less dramatically, 'invaded and ravaged' their culture, jobs, livelihood etc.


So why did rangers fans end up getting referred to as huns? Because, largely, of their behaviour when travelling, not only in Scotland, but even in Wolverhampton in 1961 where a local paper described them as 'coming across the border like marauding huns'.


It is a derogatory term for a rangers fan, and in that respects its offensive to rangers fans. Just ss sheep-shagger is meant to offend aberdeen fans, weegie bastard is meant to offend glaswegians etc.


Tl;dr if it walks like a hun, destroys towns like a hun, sings like a hun, its a hun.

You should remember that when forcing a company to do something. You are forcing people to do it who work in that company. So in a case like this when you are forcing the rights of one individual you may be taking away the freedom from others. If this happens where does it stop next?

In this case what is actually happening is trying to fix discrimination by discriminating against somebody else. The same also happens in the workplace with male / female ratios. Where a company basically ends up hiring one sex over another because they have not hired enough of one gender.

From my point of view the bakery broke a contract with a customer. This probably being a verbal agreement probably said nothing about refunds or compensation for not supplying the cake. This happens all the time between customers and company's that fail to deliver. From my point of view the reason is irrelevant.

null,false,Individual99991,smith,Smith,null,"&gt;Erm. I definitely don't think that Ursula was created as a sex toy. She certainly was a ""consolation prize"" for Elton, insofar as they both were able to continue a mutual relationship. If Ursula didn't want their ""bit of a sex life"" she could just bite him. How many sex toys can say no?

That's basically her role in life now. Sit motionless and 'peaceful' or give him a nosh. It's not like he can even return the favour.

&gt;Is their choice to have a sex life a bit gross? I know it does give me a ick factor but if that's what they want then who am I to judge? I didn't really get ""mysogyny"" out of it. Even without the sex joke, saving Ursula was a misstep (unless she could be fully restored) because Elton would never be able to move on and was stuck with a paving stone for the rest of his life-- he couldn't take her out for Chinese or have kids or even stroll in the park together. That's the tragedy of the paving stone debacle. Not because they are able to have oral sex.

You're looking at it from his point of view, not hers. The Doctor saved her from dying (or entering a mass consciousness or something), and in doing so he destroyed her life. Screw Elton not being able to move on - what about her? Unless he props her up in front of a TV, she can't do anything. Not even change the channel! She might as well be paralysed from the neck down - but at least then she could still have visits from family members and friends. As it is, she's now stuck in Elton's house, unable to do anything without his say-so. 

As for the misogyny - it's not to do with the blowjobs, it's to do with her role in the story, and the way her life is destroyed without her consent so that Elton could have a happy(ish) ending. She's a passive victim, and all that matters in the end is that Elton is happy. 

It's all especially annoying because not 10 episodes before, we'd been introduced to some mind-swapping future technology. The Doctor couldn't whip up a mindless clone and stick her consciousness in there?

&gt;While it certainly is from Elton's pov, I see no reason to assume it's made up or he is deranged. That just sounds more like wishful thinking by fans trying to fix a mistake.

We've lost games against Villa, Chelsea, Palace, United twice, Newcastle, City and West Ham. Out of that 8, scored first against Chelsea and Palace. 

Back to our style of play. We play a high pressing, high intensity game and often catch teams of the counter attack as opposed to slow, calculated build up play. This means that we can break down a lot of teams but, on the other hand, teams that are able to break us down first have a better chance of holding on until our intensity drops and we run ourselves ragged and frustrated.

You do know that this is the exact same sort of excuse the BNP/EDL use when some of its 'rogue elements' go around smashing 'paki shop' windows at its rallies.

It's a terrible excuse when they use it and it's still a terrible excuse when far-left protesters use the same justification for *their* actions.

Organisers have to take at least some level of responsibility for the actions of those they invite to join them in protest. I'd say this should go double when the organisers are laying on coaches to directly transport protesters to the place they'll be protesting.

In defense of my sanity, I've correlated these two entities

ISIL/Cyborgs of alien origin, men and women, whose rational
minds have been hijacked by blood-thirsty, technology savvy
scientists of Islamic origins. The Daleks/ISIL have unleashed
their brainwashed and souless evil on anything that ever 
gave meaning to aspirations of Arabs. Domination and 
extinction of their own cousins. Destruction of antiquities
that informed those aspirations.

The development of human coexistence has been a painful

chants and rhetoric boggles my mind.

He's just not smart on the ball.  Too often he tries to dribble when he should pass, and pass when he should dribble.  If I see him receive the ball and make another fruitless run straight into another crowd of defenders when we have a break on, I'll tear my hair out.

He offers little width, pace or penetration at present.  He's obviously got skills, but if it doesn't translate to impact on the pitch, then what's the point?

I'm not advocating selling him, but he's 23 now.  World class players are generally well and truly world class by his age.  They don't just suddenly blossom when they hit 24 or 25.  I'm resigned to him never being the player we thought we were buying, and so now it's just a matter of hoping he can develop enough to be a good squad player, and perhaps do enough to edge past Townsend for our right attacking spot (presuming we don't bring in a better talent there in the summer).",null,0,null,1427157771,null,0,false,0,cpokz8l,null,t3_302pu7,null,t1_cpokz8l,null,t3_302pu7,null,null,null,1431975995,null,52,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,52,null

The fact she had an affair with your ex and you do not like her isn't sufficient reason. You would have to prove harm or the risk of harm.

So how do you know she has no morals?

Do it and if they really love him you may find they never forgive you. You may even drive them away from you.

Capoue is far and away out best defensive midfielder.  Is he a perfect player?  No.  But I definitely think he's been dropped for disciplinary reasons, because there's no way in hell Mason is a better player than him.  Capoue a better tackler, interceptor, marker AND forward passer.

Media.

It's as simple as that. The media is incredibly influential, and even people like me who complain about the media still are guided by it.

There are essentially two or three major newspapers which don't follow the ""scrounger vs striver"", ""banker bonuses need to be high"", ""rich people will leave if we raise taxes"" narrative - the Guardian and to a lesser extent the Independent. The remainder essentially toe the line, or wholeheartedly endorse it.

The bit where I knew the world had gone mad, was when the Sun newspaper - traditionally the working mans newspaper - wrote a front page story calling Russell Brand a hypocrite for paying his taxes and rent to a landlord who didn't, in retaliation for him helping working class people keep their homes. Can anyone explain that one to me?

And to top it all off, I've yet to see the Sun front page story calling Rupert Murdoch a hypocrite for paying 0 tax in the UK. But it worked, and Brand was ridiculed as a rich hypocrite (instead of as naive but good intentioned).

There are no criteria here. 

But you have to understand that the PFA is decided by the PFA--the union of the players in the league. Every player gets a vote. These guys obviously know the game a whole lot better than all of us on this sub-reddit. 

So you have to try to think to yourself who do players ranging from Ryan Mason to Steven Gerrard to Sergio Aguero deem as being the best young player? As professionals they probably value exciting style/talent over dominance when they vote on best young player. It is easy to imagine if you asked a random player at Spurs who the best young player currently is, they would look at emerging talent rather than the dominant ones.

Lastly, in regards to your subjectivity comment, how is it any more subjective that all the professional players in the league get to vote rather than some committee appointed by the FA?

For example, Adebayor was given a really good run in the side at the start of the season.  He was Poch's first choice striker, even though he'd just recovered from malaria.  Poch played him again and again, even though he was looking fatigued, indisciplined and well out of sorts.  He kept getting selected all the way into November, well past when most of us on here thought he should be in the side.

So what happens next?  He selects Kane, Kane starts doing what Adebayor wasn't (ie. scoring goals), and then a legend is born.

Now Lamela hasn't quite been given the same amount of back-to-back game time as Adebayor was, but he's been used more frequently.  Playing him again and again when he's not producing is costing a spot in the side to another player who could actually make a difference.  In single games it might not matter hugely, but over the course of the season, that will cost us points.

The only difference between Lamela and Adebayor is that no one has really stepped up and claimed that right attacking spot in the way Kane took his chance.  Townsend is probably a nominally better option at the moment, but not overwhelmingly so.

I'd love to see Lamela really fire up and play with the kind of intensity and intelligence of someone like Hazard.  But I also don't want to wait out another whole season to see if that might ever happen.  Games need to be won in the here and now, and we've blooding too many unpolished youngsters in our side right now to strap Lamela in as a passenger for too long.

You need players who can do everything. If you have a dedicated DM/ball winner, such as Mikel, then suddenly you lose a bit of attacking threat. Play more attacking players, suddenly nobody is a good tackler and half your team is on yellow cards because they're putting in poor tackles.

Having players like Ramires/Matic to some extent is important to keep balance on the pitch. Ramires is a world class box-to-box midfielder. Yeah his touch has been a little off since he's returned after his illness, but that doesn't mean he's useless. He's a great ball winner, good passer, has pretty decent vision, and has a good shot in him too (that finish against Barca for example). 

He's a very underrated player in my opinion, and he gets a lot of shit because he lacks flair and has had a couple of off games recently. But when he plays well it goes unnoticed because its not a flashy role

I've said it before and I'll say it again, really he just needs to be quicker on the ball. He's been getting better at it fortunately. Watch highlights from a recent game compared to what he was at the start of the season. With him and Townsend there's just no even ground right now. Lamela takes too long on the ball, therefore explains why he often losses possession or someone strips it from him. He's just not quite adjusted to the pace of the game, I didn't think it would take him that long honestly. Townsend on the other hand is too quick with the ball and is why too direct offering very little creativity. Works against some, but once you have him figured out he's almost useless. Lamela once he's used properly offers far more creativity and at least a way to lose his marker.

I hate the argument that he's not wide enough player. Look, bar Townsend we have no outside wingers. Chadli, Lamela, Eriksen (when he is playing winger) all drift into the middle. On a pitch the size of WHL, we need to use that to our advantage. I'm advocating inside players, they work. That's what the two pacey fullbacks are for, they work on the outside. 

Will he ever be a £30m player? No, I'm not that stupid. Will he ever be a world beater? No. But can he contribute at Tottenham possibly one day get us the CL berth and possibly some kind of silverware? Fucking right he can contribute. He has the potential, we've all seen what he's like on his good days. Now it's a matter of putting him in the right direction.

There's also an element of discrimination based on religious beliefs.

The beliefs of the employees aren't relevant here, they're free to hold discriminatory political views and religious beliefs in private, and pursue them on their own behalf, if they want.

Good for you.

&gt; We do win important games, remember last season? 

Ironical isnt it? Remember Chelsea? 

&gt;  The game I saw ... poor team performance 

The game I saw was a poor team led by a poor manager who again failed at a crucial stage. Unless 'true red' TM want to absolve Rodgers of all blame, then I'm down with that.

&gt;   scapegoat at the most public figure. 

He's the manager. Stop with this 'leave my Rodg alone' narrative. He got due credit when he turned it around. He will get stick when the team fucks up. 

&gt;If you give me a viable solution for replacing Rodgers, I'll listen.

Rhetoric of the highest quality. You know no one has the answer to this. 

&gt; Although what I've seen from the #RodgersOut crowd is that they bark like dogs staring out the window and then roll over on their backs when we start winning again.

Atleast we arent fucking rabid stray fuckers chasing to bite anyone who talks about Rodgers and upsets the apple cart. That we leave to the true Reds TM like your good self.

Have a nice day.

I'll credit you though - you've said all along you've preferred Reina over Mignolet, and you've questioned Joe Allen too. At least you have that sort of consistency going for you.

The rest of the shit though, makes zero sense. Saying he isn't a tactical genius - saying he's extremely lucky - winning X amount of games on the run I'd say is more than just luck mate. I'm not going to say he's the best manager in the world, but he's done a pretty good job since he's been here.
