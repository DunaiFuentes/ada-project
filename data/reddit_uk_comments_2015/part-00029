Three is (arguably) the leading challenger brand in the market, and with the spectrum holdings of O2, the combined entity will provide some meaningful competition to EE. 

What will be interesting to see is what comes of the UK's mobile network infrastructure from this point. EE and 3 currently share infrastructure through the MBNL joint venture.

That's the beginning of the '12/13 season. That's 2 years ago. That's also the first season we got BR.


I remember it being before then, that he had a very good season, but that's better for your argument, because you can't say a player is one of the best in the league just off a few months' good performances.

Either way, this makes sense because of BR's high pressure system. It will help any decent DM who picks up the scraps look even better. I argued this from the beginning when Lucas' role really started to shine. 

Don't want to take anything away from the lad, because it still requires a lot of skill and smarts, but I think it says more about the importance of the role than Lucas' quality. We know he's good, and can be really good at times, but I wouldn't quite say that would make him the best raw (is that the right word?) player in his position; it depends on tactics to get the most out of your holding mids.

I think we're far enough along in the cup that we can't take any unnecessary risks, and the opposition is to be taken seriously.  I hate to say it, but Tremmel does seem to be a liability at this point... though odds are, he'll get the start.  I think Naughton will have to spend some time training with the team before starting, so I do not forsee his immediate inclusion.  My guess would be Angel, for leadership and stability.  I'd be interested to see how Bartley and Amat show, as I do like both of them and think they could certainly play first team... we are just so lucky as to have two better options. Left back is tricky...  I would honestly prefer to have Taylor still play there, to build some more consistency in his form, rather than risk one of our other... options.  I think Shelvey will get a chance to play higher up - his preferred position, and where I'd rather see him anyways. His failings have largely been in (a) poor discipline, which is less of a factor in a less defensive role, and (b) long, speculative passes, which don't work well as a holding midfielder, but serves as an asset for unlocking defenses when higher up, when there is more room to run into. He has been infuriating this season at times in the holding role, but his clear talent should not be ignored, even if it should rightly play second fiddle to Gylfi. Holding midfield could go a couple ways... ultimately, I'd like to see one of the young kids start alongside Britton (so long as he's up to it), build confidence, and then bring on one of the others for him in the second half as long as things are going well. Mo should get a start, and likely Dyer, though I wouldn't be surprised if Emnes was in, or at least subbed. Montero will hopefully be on the bench, and we may give him time, depending on how he feels and the game goes.  As far as a striker goes, he may not be the most popular man in Wales at the moment, but I want Gomis to get the start, earn his money, and build form for league.

For me I think the best way to solve it is to do away with Scottish MP's entirely and we'll just send our MSP's. Right now my Labour MP basically doesn't influence my life. He goes to Westminster and votes on policies that won't change my life but will change a Scottish budget he's not involved in spending (Unless it's immigration, welfare, foreign affairs etc). He's practically pointless and his presence is pissing off the English. Let's get rid.

If we done that I think it would go a long way to cutting ties between UK wide and regional parties, my Westminster representative would actually be directly responsible for *all* government issues. If he votes on Education in England he has to stand in Holyrood and justify why he done it, what does he gain for me by doing that? 

Then all you really need is a slight policy change that makes it obvious to what extent any given bill will effect Scotland and appropriately criticises Scottish MP's for their involvement thereafter. 

Maybe even set up a system where in return for abstaining from these kinds of things Scottish MP's have the right to have the financial impact in Scotland assessed and Barnet adjusted accordingly. It would mess with the tax/per/head stuff but it seems like a fair trade to me. 

Treat Scotland as a singular block that can have a majority within, if that majority doesn't like the direction taken by the wider parliament then it there is *some* recourse to guarantee the change won't effect it.

It's effectively federalisation but without all the need for English devolution, presidents etc. Scottish MP's can still be health secretary because they are still responsible for health policy all the way down to me, just split across two parliaments for us in Scotland not for everyone else.

Far from *perfect* but it's better than what we've got. Kills off the *blame westminster* angle, kills the *that's devolved so they caused it* problem, doesn't *really* create two tier MP's and allows England to have the laws it votes for as long as its willing to accept that equally Scottish votes for Scottish laws *and* budgeting.",null,0,null,1421992244,null,0,1421992474,0,cny2466,null,t3_2taqj6,null,t1_cny2466,null,t1_cny1dot,null,null,null,1424442636,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Step 1: Legalise all drugs and also prostitution.

Step 2: With the millions saved from not having to police drug/prostitution related activties, use the revenue instead on research and development into science related areas.

Step 3: Become an innovation nation (Thanks to step 2)

Step 4: Increase entrepreneurship - set up a product development centre for folks to create prototypes and eventually bring them into production and to market! Also have greater taxes on large PLC and give tax breaks for SME's to help startups and with growth!

Step 5: Expand the railway infrasture across all of NI. 

Step 6: Have a tram system in Belfast to diversify our public transportation and help reduce congestion. [We're #1 in the UK for congestion!](http://www.u.tv/News/Belfast-most-congested-city/18155494-f929-4a55-89b3-59ac139f6ed7)

In fact Martinez's man management isn't even being called into question here. I've quite vocally said I still think he's a top manager who's been doing the best he can with a lot of injuries and players showing their age (admittedly I've also said sometimes his tactics have been off, but the same is true for almost any manager)... In the long run, Besic and McCarthy are obviously going to be partnered up as our defensive mid pair, probably sooner rather than later, now that Barry's been showing his age.

We're not really talking about Barkley, or Baines, or Coleman, Mirallas, or Stones or Oviedo either. We're talking about McCarthy and Besic and defensive mids. Sure, all of those players you named are tops, I didn't call their ability into question. And to answer your question, yes, I think Besic has been awesome. I feel his enthusiasm and speed have been class since day one and the West Brom game he really came into his own and played brilliantly both in attack and defence. 

Personally, I don't buy into that ""look at our record with him in the team"" stuff. It's a team game; one player can make the difference and one player can't, but our record with him in the team has no bearing on how the whole team plays, in my opinion. Sure, he's fucked up a few times (his first touch against Chelsea, anyone?) but he's young and how many young players haven't a few times? He has a whole lot of potential coupled with speed, skill, endless energy, and devilish good looks. I think he's an important player and will continue to be for some time.

I dont find it right that someone is entitled to drive around while claiming benefits. A free bus pass is something id happily allow, free train pass even. 
But the idea of a car to me is something that is a luxury. 2 of my friends started at the same work place, when they started they both caught 2 buses, for around 1Hr 45mins each way.

Labour / Tory are idealogical opposites in some areas but weren't on how to run an anti-independence campaign. As far as I'm aware Labour were fully on board with the approach that was taken. There was no need to compromise. 

In my opinion if Labour were true to their roots they would have had a serious problem with taking the more negative approach. They know *exactly* how disliked the Tories are in Scotland (They've been capitalising on it for decades) and there was literally nothing stopping them running their own separate &amp; positive campaign. The passionate Gordon Brown speeches of *""You can have everything""* didn't happen until the very end when they were shitting themselves and even then it appears it was a very well laid Tory trap they walked straight into. 

They didn't do their own campaign though. So for me the only logical conclusion is that they had no objections to pissing off Scotland by linking arms with the Tories and didn't care/understand the positions of the bedrock of SNP/Indy support which was the ordinary working class who Labour are *supposed* to stand up for.

We had George Galloway reminding us about WW2 and we had Ed Milliband reminding us about the foundation of the Labour movement. Outwith that it was predominantly *""The SNP suck and are liars""* which is the same tired act they've used in Holyrood for the past 8 years whilst the SNP take all their votes. An act they are *still* using even though SNP support is soaring, all they've done is its now *""The SNP suck and are liars.. and we're better patriots""*

I don't like the Tories but at the very least you know where they stand, what they want and what they'll oppose you on. They can be worked with. Fuck knows what Labour wants.

From one city fan to another, welcome onboard and be prepared for the heartbreaks. We've had some good times and a lot of bad times, but this just makes the good times even sweeter. Check out some of our old matches like the Spurs match as mentioned above. You can also check out some of the past derbies to see what it was like back then; there were way more fouls and hard tackles then. I remember Michael Ball (I think) injuring Ronaldo from a slide tackle in one of the derbies.

So, hypothetically, a 25 million fee over a 5 year contract would come out as 5 million a year. This, along with his wages produces one number which is Cuadrado's annual cost for us.

I think Salah's loan actually makes some sense because we'd be getting his FFP cost off the books, which thereby frees up space for Cuadrado. 

With regard to Schürrle, I can see why letting him depart may change our stance on Cuadrado. As it stands, Salah costs about 3.5 million a year, on our books. Schürrle comes in at more than double that, at a little under 8 million per year. 

If we were to only let Salah depart and bringing in Cuadrado on his full buyout clause, his FFP cost would be a little over 10.2 million a year. In total, our FFP hit would be 29 million on our 3 right wingers (Cuadrado, Schürrle, and Willian) annually. I'm assuming the rationale is that it's a little hefty, seeing as our striker trio comes in at a little under 26 million a year.

If someone takes the stance that a formal religious education is inherently harmful then you'd have to have faith that the alternative isn't, and then it's really down to someone's view as to what a healthy upbringing constitutes. Personally I'd find that pretty hard to define. It certainly doesn't end at 'be excellent to each other'.

This is such a huge topic that I wasn't sure how to respond. I take the view that education absolutely extends into value systems, otherwise we end up with Gradgrind. 

Given that people hold and prefer profoundly different value systems, we can't objectively say that one value system is better than another. Because of this an education system needs to contain an element of tolerance and pluralism *even if the underlying value system doesn't support this*.

&gt;You realise that if the same criteria were applied to the quality of local authority education, heads and teachers, there'd be no need for OFSTED? And then you'd be removing the real absurdity of scoring, league tables and the need to be 'performant' to be judged a success

The root cause of the tick box culture in public services is a deep distrust of the professionals involved. Professionals will want to follow evidence based practice which might be inconvenient to the politicians.  The best way of running a public service is to recruit competent professionals, set some objectives, and let them get on with it. 

Even then some sort of independent review would be necessary. Competent professionals are still vulnerable to groupthink and can still go off the rails.

[Symbol](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/symbol) *noun*:

*1. something used for or regarded as representing something else; a material object representing something, often something immaterial; emblem, token, or sign.*

*2. a letter, figure, or other character or mark or a combination of letters or the like used to designate something: the algebraic symbol x; the chemical symbol Au.*

*3. (especially in semiotics)* **a word, phrase** *, image, or the like having a complex of associated meanings and perceived as having inherent value separable from that which is symbolized, as being part of that which is symbolized, and as performing its normal function of standing for or representing that which is symbolized: usually conceived as deriving its meaning chiefly from the structure in which it appears, and generally distinguished from a sign.*

Language is, by definition, symbolic. Words, whether written or spoken, are symbols. You don't have *the* European Union on your passport, but you have words with that meaning. Those words are thus a symbol. If he had said ""sign"" or ""emblem"", you may have had a point. But he said ""symbol"", so you haven't.

To learn more on the subject: Wikipedia entries on [symbol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol) and [semiotics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics).

I think it's really cool that you are interested in the topic and yes it does certainly lead to very interesting discussions but I think your expectations here are a little off. You clearly don't know much about the topic, all you have linked is a Wikipedia article. You want a discussion but despite your lack of background you already have an opinion and want me to basically teach you. I'm sorry but I think it's really unfair to come into this topic so strongly without really knowing what you're talking about.

If you do wanna learn more about the topic this article has a very quick review of why the argument your presenting creates a problem. A very good book on gender differences, she goes into detail on the how topic and how a lot of research done in this area is really shoddy and unreliable. Sex/gender by Anne Fausto-sterling is a kind of 101 into this topic and good for a little background. To summarise the crux of the issue when it comes to biotruths, is that there are biological distinctions between gender, of course, for example there is a lot of evidence showing that the brain is sexed in some way. It becomes very difficult to divorce what is biology and what is cultural influence. For example your claim that men are sexually visual primarily, that does seem to be true cross culturally, but most cultures are very focused on the male gaze, things are made for guys case in point, the page 3 girls. Another example is the hip to ratio equation and how men are mostly attracted to women that fit within a certain range because it indicates health. I would say culture is a much bigger factor when it comes to classifying beauty, in North Africa whole groups think the bigger a woman is the more beautiful, to the point they say things like anyone can have stretch marks on their legs and abdomen, only the truly beautiful have them on their arm (there's a ethnographic work on this called bodies, though I don't recall the authors name). And of course even if there are biological differences does that mean we should box people up based on that? Are we going to shape our culture EVEN MORE on preconceptions? We do it already by the way, This really good and quite funny article by Emily Martin discusses how even our language choice when discussing biology is very gendered and very telling of our cultural perceptions of gender. And this is not barely touching the surface of the topic Nd not even bringing trans and homosexuality into the equation.

I hope this has given you an overview on the topic and helped you understand why I'm reluctant to discuss it with someone without much background :)

&gt; The e-petition 'introduce mandatory noise complaint waiver for anyone who buys or rents a property close to motorsport venue' signed by you recently reached 37,927 signatures and a response has been made to it.


&gt; As this e-petition has received more than 10 000 signatures, the relevant Government department have provided the following response: 

&gt;**Introduction** 

&gt;The issues raised in this e-petition relate to land use in England and Wales. They touch on the law relating to the ownership of property and the private law of nuisance as well as the planning system, statutory nuisance and the regulation of public events. The underlying complaint is that new residents object to established activities within their new neighbourhood. Individuals are in general free to live in any part of England and Wales. They may buy, rent or be permitted to use a residence. On taking up residence they generally have the same rights as the existing inhabitants. Removing the rights of incomers to protect themselves against nuisances would discriminate against them and probably intensify the enquiries made by prospective residents, making transactions more complicated and expensive, as well as increasing the risk of post-transaction litigation about non-disclosure or limited disclosure. The Government has no plans to change the law in this respect.

&gt;**The law of nuisance**

&gt; The private law of nuisance is a long-standing common law tort, or civil wrong, which affects a person’s private rights in relation to land. The law recognises that, in general, every person is entitled to the comfortable and healthy enjoyment of the land or premises owned or occupied by them. It is open to anyone with an interest in land to bring a civil claim where there has been an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of their land as a result of the unreasonable use of neighbouring land by another person (the defendant). Remedies available could include an injunction to moderate or cease the unreasonable use of the land and/or damages for the interference suffered. The standard to be applied by the courts in determining whether the claimant is entitled to a remedy is an objective one based on what is reasonable to the average person. It is also necessary to take account of the circumstances and nature of the locality in which the claimant is living. While any benefit to the wider community arising from the defendant’s use of their land is not a defence against a claim, it may be a factor considered by the court when assessing if the use is reasonable. The fact that the defendant may have been using the land in that way before the claimant came to the vicinity is also not a defence, although the extent to which the claimant was aware of the activity when acquiring their interest in the land may be a factor that the court will consider as part of the overall picture. Applying these general principles, the court has to reach a decision in the light of all the circumstances of the individual case. 

&gt;Achieving a just outcome in such civil disputes is a matter best left to the courts, and the Government has no plans to change the law in this area. There is also statutory nuisance legislation which draws on common law nuisance. It would apply to noise from premises that unreasonably and substantially interferes with a person’s enjoyment of their property or damages their health. It also places a duty on local authorities to take action, rather than individuals relying on seeking redress through the courts. Before using this legislation, the local authority would assess whether a statutory nuisance exists based on the circumstances of the case, taking into account a range of factors including how the character of the locality (including existing noise sources) affects the situation. Individuals may also bring private actions under this legislation There are safeguards for motor sport venues in relation to complaints from nearby residents. When assessing statutory nuisance and deciding on potential enforcement action and whether mitigation measures are required, the venues – or any businesses - have a defence of best practicable means if they can demonstrate that they have done all they reasonably and practicably can to minimise the noise impact. 

&gt;**Planning**

&gt; The planning system has an important role to play in helping to prevent nuisances occurring in the first place. National planning policy for England as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework expects local planning policies and decisions to avoid noise from giving rise to significant adverse impacts on health and quality of life as a result of new development, and mitigate and reduce to a minimum other adverse impacts on heath and quality of life arising from noise from new development, including through the use of conditions. 

&gt;However, it should be borne in mind that the grant of planning permission does not license a nuisance and in some cases businesses may need to do more than just comply with their planning conditions to avoid causing a nuisance. Where appropriate, the courts will look at planning decisions and compliance with any planning decisions when assessing whether a nuisance exists. Elements of an ‘agent of change” or “right of first occupant” principle already exist within national planning policy and guidance. The National Planning Policy Framework, for example, states that existing businesses wanting to develop in continuance of their business should not have unreasonable restrictions put on them because of changes in nearby land uses since they were established. 

&gt;In particular, the planning guidance supporting the Framework directly addresses the issue of noise sensitive developments, like new residential developments, where there is an existing noise source and includes advice on noise mitigation measures. 

&gt;In a recent update of the guidance, the Department for Communities and Local Government underlined planning’s contribution to avoiding future complaints including through looking to developers building new homes near venues giving rise to noise to include sound-proofing in the homes. 

&gt;**Motor sports venues**

&gt; The Government fully recognises the huge popularity of motor sport in this country both on 2 and 4 wheels. Motor sport is important in terms sporting participation, volunteering, engineering, advancements in technology, job creation and wider economic benefits. In summary, our policies and legislation, along with existing planning guidance, allow people to enjoy motor sport while managing the noise environment and without placing an unnecessary burden on businesses that operate as motor sport venues. The Government considers that it is striking the right balance between those who welcome motor sport and those who have concerns about it. This e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.

**Margaret Thatcher**
Died a couple of years ago, but still exerts tremendous influence, with 'Thatcherite' being both hurled as an insult (by the left) and worn as a badge of honour (by the right). What Reagan was to the US, Thatcher was to the UK: An anti-trade union, anti-USSR, free marketeer with a strong populist streak. She was the first female PM, led us to war in the Falklands, and helped keep her party I  power for 18 years (although they themselves booted her out over a deeply unpopular 'poll tax': A flat rate tax on property).

**Tony Blair**
Led (New) Labour to its first General Election victory in 18 years in 1997 and won further elections in 2001 and 2005. If Thatcher is roughly equivalent to Reagan, Blair was a British Bill Clinton - that is, until he embraced George W. Bush's War on Terror and led the country into Afghanistan then Iraq. Like Thatcher, he's a deeply divisive figure, especially within the Labour Party, who elected Ed Miliband as leader partly because he was seen as rejecting 'Blairite'/New Labour policies.

Also, I've been reading Assembly funding and budget scripts for a few years now, and there's no such thing as a 'surplus'; any 'savings' are usually discovered *after* the cash has already been allocated to other projects. Deficit funding at it's finest.

There's pleny of cash around for R&amp;D such as EPSRC grants, TSB calls, Innovation Vouchers (although at 4k they're pretty useless) to mention just a few. R&amp;D always attracts money, but what we need is a culture of innovation, and you get that by collaborating and engaging with the community across science, technology, arts, engineering, etc. Projects like FNM, FabLab, Farset Labs, Skainos Centre, Oh Yeah Music Centre, and NISP Connect do great stuff in terms of simply bringing people together.

Watching porn in public is something that we all know intuitively not to do - the question of whether it's reasonable or not doesn't even arise. But because Page 3 is in the newspaper, it falls into a different category.

There's a significant support for small-c conservative ideas in Scotland. However this is greatly diminished by FPTP.

In the 2011 Scottish elections (AMS) they got about 12% of the vote so received about 12% of the seats in Holyrood.

In the 2010 general election (FPTP) they got about 18% of the vote however FPTP gave them only 1 seat out of 59 (about 2%).

&gt;It's the part where we put it in a national newspaper and act like it's normal to imply that these women are good to look at and not much else.

We can change a few words in these comments to point out the weakness of your arguments:

&gt;**Charlie Hebdo** is **racist** because it makes **the mocking of Islam** into something so 'mundane' and 'inherent' that even a newspaper does it. It desensitises you to the issue at hand.

These are arguments as to why page 3 is bad. They are weak and assume that your morality is universal and everyone is ashamed of the human form as you are. A lot of people don't have a stick up their arse about nudity (which page 3 is not). You can dress it up as it being better for society and that everyone who disagrees with you is ""wrong"" or ""sexist"", but in reality, you're just trying to push your middle class puritanism onto the working classes, of which you know nothing about (inb4 ""I have working class relatives - my great great uncle was a coal miner, so I AM working class"").

If Page 3 was soooo terrible (and believe me, I think its as tacky as shit), why are all these women working for them on their own volition? Who are you to declare what can and cannot be published in the free press?  It seems like the Mary Whitehouse moral outrage crusaders are back, but rather than using the banner of Christianity, you're using the banner of sexism.

I'd like to think he'd be thankful for that and also just enjoying his time here enough to want to stay.  

Alderweireld I don't know; I'd love him to stay but he is just so damn good, he could play in just about any top team. I don't really know who Atletico have that could push him out, but as they do then I hope he's enjoying playing with us, getting game time and working under Koeman (who he's said has been a big influence) enough to stay. If we did get him for £6m then that would be the biggest steal since Lewandowski for free, because I would happily see Saints pay £20m for a player of his calibre. Just got to hope that a) our buyout clause will come before any other bids and b) Atletico won't want him back themselves.  

Cork I've said in the other thread, I would love to keep but would understand if he wanted to go somewhere else to get regular football. He's definitely good enough for any PL team outside of the top 8 (and I think even a few within it), and good enough to be their first choice holding midfielder. It is just a shame for him that we have two of the best in the league in his position already.  

Clyne I don't know about, I feel like he's so good that he could get snapped up by Chelsea or City, but at present, as things stand, I don't know if going to United would be as good as staying with us! Obviously it might just come down to wages, which we can't compete with, but who knows, he's been here a while and is improving with us all the time, maybe he'll stay if we get CL.  

Rodriguez - total unknown. Lets see how he comes back, I still think he'll be off as opposed to signing a new contract, but if someone offered £20m right now for a player that hasn't played in almost a year I would  be tempted to take it and reinvest in someone who could help the team now. If he didn't want to stay, won't sign a new contract, we may as well see if we can't get some money for him before people can take stock of his condition on returning. Though I 100% doubt that every other top 6 team is after him, because he's been out so long. It's just a slow window.

If you have all of those and still have money left over, it's worth buying ABS, but never prioritise it above the others. Personally I put it at about the level of self-cancelling indicators - nice to have, improves safety to a certain extent, but something that I've lived without and not missed for most of my life.

Just bear in mind that it's not a silver bullet. You still need to think about where and when to brake. If the road is slippery or icy, ABS will not increase the maximum braking available on that surface even if it helps to get you a bit closer to that limit - and it's still possible to go off the road if you go into a corner too hot and try to brake your way out of trouble.

You may or may not find that it fires up in normal riding. I had a BMW R1200S (a sports bike) for 2-3 years, and never felt it work.

&gt;Passages in the [Old Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament) book [Leviticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviticus) that prohibit ""lying with mankind as with womankind: it is abomination"" and the story of [Sodom and Gomorrah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodom_and_Gomorrah) have historically been interpreted as condemning [homosexual acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_acts), as have several [Pauline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle) passages. Today too some interpreters uphold that understanding of these passages, while other interpreters maintain that they do not condemn homosexuality, saying that historical context suggests other interpretations or that rare or unusual words in the passages may not be referring to homosexuality.

**David Cameron**
Current Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party. He was elected to lead his party promising to 'detoxify' the Conservative 'brand' as it was widely seen as 'the nasty party'. He introduced environmentalism to the party and promised to match Labour's spending. His party became the largest in the House of Commons but lacked an overall majority, leading to the formation of the current coalition with the Liberal Democrats. His project of detoxifying the party has largely been thrown to one side in the wake of the financial crisis.

**Ed Miliband**
Ed Miliband is the leader of the Labour Party. He was elected after the 2010 election and set about moving the party away from its recent past, condemning the Iraq War and generally moving the party more to he left. He's very unpopular due more to the fact that he looks weird than any substantial objections - his policies, from tighter regulation of the renting sector, to an energy price freeze are generally popular, but he isn't.

**Nick Clegg**
Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats. He was briefly the most popular politician in the country, treading a middle ground between the Tories and Labour, before going into coalition with the Tories and reneging on a promise to abolish university tuition fees: He instead voted to triple them.

**Nigel Farage**
Leader of Ukip, the largest British Party in the European Parliament. He's one of the most popular politicians in the country, regularly seen drinking pints and talking 'common sense'. He's basically a right wing populist who is treated with scorn by people who consider themselves in the know, and with adulation by those who think the in-the-know are stuck-up bastards.

They don't monitor the content of them, but if someone wanted to blackmail you because you were calling another person, then that could happen already.  

The reason that this shouldn't happen isn't because someone who shouldn't access the data does (there should be a whole load of oversight into who has access to the data that will limit this).

The reason it shouldn't happen is because there will be too much data for anything useful to be done with it.  If you suddenly needed to investigate me and look back at 12 months of communications, then there will be thousands of emails across four different email addresses, huge numbers of reddit posts and comments, tweets, facebook posts, skype messages, calls, etc before you even think about webpages that I've visited, games I've played and so on.  Plus it will be badly dispersed - I'm in an office at the moment, but I'm sometimes in different offices, using different computers, different wifi, different mobile connectors, etc, each of them logged in a different place by a different ISP.  Putting a picture of me together would be a complete and utter nightmare that would mean you were almost certain to miss something.  Any negative has a huge likelihood of being false (and I'm not trying to hide my activity).  Then on the flip side, the likelihood of a false positive is huge as well if you can't see the content.  So here we now have a load of time and effort being wasted investigating false positives, with the negatives missing and suddenly you realise the system doesn't do what it was intended to do.

This is before you take into consideration the cost of keeping the data.  ",null,0,null,1422013489,null,0,false,0,cny7irp,null,t3_2te41m,null,t1_cny7irp,null,t1_cny6y67,null,null,null,1424440037,null,-15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-15,null

Bunch transfer payments back to the UK into lump sums rather than small monthly amounts and you can save on  transaction fees - even if you're earning minimal interest in Korea you can undo all of the benefit of transferring it if you tot up the transfer costs. If you're only there a year you can probably do just one. I'm not sure how volatile the Won/GBP rates are.

Credit cards: Investigate whether a low foreign fee UK card is going to work out better than a local card. Where we are we spend a fortune each month compared to the UK on our card (easily over £5k a month) and the Lloyds Avios premier card is a significant bonus - no foreign transaction loading and the Avios pay for regular flights and upgrades home, while maintaining a solid credit rating at home. The local cards offered nothing in benefits and cost a fortune. 

Also, most of the rest of the world doesn't have free banking, so don't be surprised if even the most basic checking account costs you £50-100 a year.

Sure. Ultimately it comes down to asking if you want to preserve the UK then is it better to preserve it in a federal form or not at all?

&gt; It would not be fair for rUK to be in a position whereby it has no control over something for which it is ultimately responsible.

Although it would receive something in return of course: if Scotland pays a levy for ""shared services"" like defence or foreign policy then that would also encompass shared financial stability.

Then again the UK gave [Ireland a £14bn bailout](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9813358/British-taxpayers-funded-Irelands-14bn-bail-out.html) without any prior arrangement.

We work in a representative democracy, which means we expect our government to act as delegated representatives of the 'interests' of the people. As the classic quote sort-of goes, the public 'interest' is not the same as what the public are interested in, but is instead a kind of enlighted steady-state where - in the long run - everyone is as happy and prosperous as they can be.

Part of the balance of democracy is that sometimes parties have to make stupid (or ideological) decisions which go against the short-terms interests of the people in favour of some long-term vision of what the country should look like. For example, none of the major parties are in favour of the death penalty despite a slightly better than 50% support for it in the UK as a whole because they think it is morally wrong (also, probably, they don't want to be the party in charge when an obviously innocent person is killed). Alternatively, the Lib Dems and Greens are in favour of electoral reform despite rock-bottom support for it because they think it is more democratic.

One example of such a policy is the NHS. Most mainstream parties know it is so heavily in the national interest to keep something like the NHS operating that no matter what public opinion on the matter they should not waver. I know this sub is always like, ""Hurr durr Tories will privatise the NHS"" (and they will, just not in the 'American' way some commenters seem to think) but in reality the Tories are comitted to an NHS free at the point of use, just changing the way it is structured. If a party like UKIP claim they will just roll over and not defend the NHS at the first hint it is unpopular then I don't think they are fit to govern.

On the train I found myself traveling in that night all the toilets had been locked.

It's a tricky one; you're right about us being a representative democracy -- we don't get to vote on individual policies, only the aggregate that any one party represents.

&gt; For example, none of the major parties are in favour of the death penalty despite a slightly better than 50% support for it in the UK as a whole because they think it is morally wrong 

The problem is that when they do survey's like this they never consider that question of how much the voter cares about it.  That 50% support the death penalty, all other things being equal, should mean that we get the death penalty. We don't because all other things are not equal -- we don't have two identical parties save for one policy, death penalty or not, because if we did, going on those polling figures, the death-penalty party would get in.  The point is that voters obviously rank other things of higher importance when selecting their party.

&gt; One example of such a policy is the NHS. Most mainstream parties know it is so heavily in the national interest to keep something like the NHS operating that no matter what public opinion on the matter they should not waver.

The NHS is a big one, so obviously people are going to care lots about that one.  It might be that that would be a vote swinger too; far more than death penalty policy would be.  The principle is the same though -- we can only vote for aggregate policy.  Presumably though, parties will try and select that set of policies that get them the most votes when all policies are considered in combination, not in isolation.

With that in mind then; I don't see that it would be unreasonable, or even shock-inducing, for a party to have a policy of ""we favour privatisation in the event that the voters are accepting of it"".  It seems fairly democratic in fact -- in fact, it seems so completely and utterly wet as a policy that I'm not sure it's even worth stating.  I'm not stating a preference for what I believe in this case -- I'm saying that I don't understand the fuss, given that ""we'll do this, only if people want us to"" is pretty much the basis for all party policy.

&gt; To put it another way - would you vote for a party that says, ""We will tax you to fund essential services, unless you don't want us to""?

That people don't like paying tax is not the same as people wanting to scrap taxation.  I don't like going to the dentist, the shops, paying electricity bills and a whole host of other things.  I understand that they are necessary though, just as with taxation.  So would I vote for a party that said ""we will scrap all taxation, and hence get rid of all essential services"", I would understand (as do most people I think) that that would be a foolish vote.  Now, we might debate what are ""essential services"", and I think that is the essence of all political debate in the UK, but only a idiot would think they can vote for no tax, but still have the services they want in the same way that everyone knows if you don't pay your electricity bill, the lights go out.",null,0,null,1422017234,null,0,false,0,cny8gjh,null,t3_2ta84a,null,t1_cny8gjh,null,t1_cny84qn,null,null,null,1424439600,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

No I work in British pharmaceuticals tied to academic research groups. The greens polices on animal welfare within science is appalling. If their policies (note plural not singular) were to be pushed through:

* No more animal models for testing new drugs/therapeutics - this includes genetically modified mice or mice used for grafting cancer cells to.

* No more animal cell lines for testing drugs/therapeutics - As a result of this and the above, the level of effective research is pretty much non existant.

* No more animal derived products - say goodbye to all those testing kits you manufactured to test for different diseases, ie Cancer/Genetic disease. Can also say goodbye to most of those cancer drugs we currently use as they are all animal derived.

* British pharma companies will also ship all their research (and potentially manafacturing) out of the UK to countries which allow it. Because its the only place you'll get effective research done.

* Say goodbye to UK universties having ground breaking research and as such being competitive globally in the courses they teach, because if you cant do the research then nobody is going to want to work for your university, when they can do it in another country.

As a result of this, nobody is going to fund research in the UK. Literally nobody would waste the money when you can just fund a group In France for example, who can do more then you and achieve more for exactly the same amount of money.
Furthermore there will be intense limitations on what treatments they can give to people with cancer or those who are immunodeficient. Hell even vaccinations require murine studies to make sure they are safe. 

People always bring up the fact that the Greens want to 'Increase funding to British science research'. One thing they have yet to even bother learning is that money isn't the issue. Its an issue of 'If i do this test on an animal i get a result which is potentially applicable in humans' then becoming 'I cant do this test now, and even all this money isn't going to magically give me the same results I receive off an animal'.

It's a joke and the fact that the Greens have always failed to address this issue when asked is why pretty much everyone in the Industry will not vote green.

Yeah, let's not play the false equivalence game, especially when this bill makes a very specific provision to ensure that the content of these communications should not be recorded (Section 3A, ""Power to ensure or facilitate availability of data"", part (4), I believe states this fairly clearly), ensures that the data can only be accessed with a warrant (Section 3A, ""Consultation Requirements"", also ""Other Safeguards""), and (perhaps most importantly of all) ensures that any party that keeps this data must do so securely, and may only access it when authorised to do so (3A, ""Data Security and Integrity"").

There are also other interesting provisions in there, such as ensuring that nothing that is obtained can be considered unlawful in of itself (unless of course it's unlawful for other reasons, such as being CP or whatever), which ensures that the government can make no value judgements based on the data it collects.

Now I'm not a big fan of this, I would probably argue that this sort of data should only be stored when a warrant is issued, and not stored by default.  On the other hand, if you're trying to find evidence of an action after that action has happened, then you're going to want that year's worth of evidence available for you to look at (with the proper warrants and documentation from the judicial system).

Now to answer your specific issue with this:  It is abusable in exactly the same way that *any* piece of evidence that police gather can be abusable, and we don't ask police to just not do their jobs because we can't prove that they're all incorruptible.  That's why we have extensive safeguards that ensure that, when a piece of evidence is obtained that could potentially damage an individual, it is not then immediately released to the public, but rather dealt with officially.  That's essentially why we have an organised, official, publicly *accountable* group known as the ""police"", who act in tandem with the organised official, publicly *accountable* group known as the ""judiciary"" to ensure that when someone is accused of being a criminal, they receive justice and not a gang mob.

Comparing the UK to NK is a bit like comparing this simile to Wordsworth at his finest.  North Korea works on the basis the the Glorious Leader is correct, that the police serving him are right, and that if the government says something it is true.  On the other hand, the UK works on the basis that the Prime Minister sets a direction, the police do not serve him in any way but instead uphold the law which is balanced by constitutional monarchy, the two-house system, as well as a judicial system that can intervene, and if the government says something it should be checked at all costs.

Your FB analogy assumes that anyone who works for the police will have access to all the files they like on anybody they like, and will then be allowed to go around talking about them.  If this were the case with this new bill, then it would have been the case for the past however many years we've had an accountable police force.  The government does not have this power, this amendment grants the power to police who obtain a legal warrant for which in most cases they need evidence of reasonable suspicion.

So finally, why don't I care?  Because this amendment, summed up, allows a publicly-accountable body to inspect content-free data that I have produced in the last year if they have a legal warrant.  That's not a big issue.  If everything you said was true, then yes, by golly gosh I would care, I would care a great deal that my privacy was being invaded.  On the other hand, you've been spouting largely bullshit, so I can't claim to be desperately worried about your claims.",null,0,null,1422018706,null,0,false,0,cny8wf0,null,t3_2te41m,null,t1_cny8wf0,null,t1_cny6y67,null,null,null,1424439389,null,-16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-16,null

cagechicane, lets just agree we like having them both in the squad, they love lfc and have bought into the system and at the end of the day thats what we need. like SAF used to do, he would get players and make them play well in his system and theyd move else where and struggle. i can see BR's lfc starting to get that kind of presence. not to compare the two because as much as i must bite my tongue on this one, SAF is lightyears better of a coach than BR is. BR may never reach those heights, but who will? anyways something to model after, if not anything else.

All elections could be done on a policy-by-policy basis on a site that looks a lot like reddit (i.e. 'upvote' policies you want, 'downvote' policies you strongly disagree with, and a space to discuss policies you are unsure of). You'd still need a civil service, but you wouldn't need a Parliament or Prime Minister. If you want to get fancy there are ways to reflect strength of preference (i.e. a 'double upvote' function once every day), but I think most people would object on principle rather than technicalities.

I put it to you that the point of political parties is therefore *not* to reflect the electorate, but in some sense to guide them. I think you must accept this, because you indicate that you would not vote for a party which said, ""We will consider scrapping all tax if 50% of the electorate would vote for us if we did it"" - a clear example of believing there is some point to political parties beyond simply actioning the short-term desires of the people.",null,0,null,1422020072,null,0,false,0,cny9d11,null,t3_2ta84a,null,t1_cny9d11,null,t1_cny8gjh,null,null,null,1424439175,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

 [**Homosexuality in the New Testament**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality%20in%20the%20New%20Testament): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;In the [New Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament) (NT) there are at least three passages that may refer to homosexual activity: Romans 1:26–27, 1 Corinthians 6:9–10, and 1 Timothy 1:9–10. A fourth passage, Jude 1:7, is often interpreted as referring to homosexuality. None of the [four gospels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel#Canonical_gospels) mentions the subject directly, and there is nothing about [homosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality) in the Book of Acts, in Hebrews, in Revelation, or in the letters attributed to James, Peter, and John. Jesus may be restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples when he cites Genesis during a discussion of marriage (Matthew 19:4-6 and Mark 10:6-9).

chelsea will be much  more adventurous in the second leg. i can see it being a 4-5 goal thriller. i think some of the keys to that game are gonna be we have to continue to inject pace into the squad. having sturridge (hopefully), coutinho, sterling, marko, moreno, even hendo..that's 6 players who harrass, harry and are relatively pacey. that was really, in my opinion, chelsea's downfall in the first leg, our pacey pressing disrupted them while on the ball and made lucas' job of destroying that much easier. im fine with hazard and willian having hte ball on the wings all day. we have pacey wingbacks who handled everything thrown at them. can made a boo boo but he showed class in how he reacted to his mistake. gonnna be an awesommmeeeeee semi final...this is exactly what we wanted guys, now lets go beat those plastic rentboys!",null,0,null,1422020917,null,0,false,0,cny9o3e,null,t3_2tdvci,null,t1_cny9o3e,null,t3_2tdvci,null,null,null,1424439031,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

It does both want and need you to listen. This is primarily because SNP is concerned with breaking the Monopoly that Labour and Conservative have, which has stifled change for decades.

You shouldn't just listen to things that are meant for you. Indeed, you should listen to all things to widen your perspective and learn about things that are not directly in your sphere. This is empowering.

I wasn't saying it was on a policy-by-policy basis.  I was saying that you only vote on a policy set, and the set that any party selects is what defines the party.   Because they are a set, it's not just a pick and choose thing because different people will have different mutual exclusions for policies they like.  The optimum combination is not simply those individual policies that have the highest support.

&gt; I put it to you that the point of political parties is therefore not to reflect the electorate, but in some sense to guide them.

You have greater faith in the parties than I do.  I think their goal is to obtain power, and they will say and do the thing that is most likely to get them that.  Now, because picking the optimum policy set is neither obvious nor easy nor, perhaps, even a unique or stable solution, we end up with multiple parties, altering their policy sets over time.

&gt; I think you must accept this, because you indicate that you would not vote for a party which said

&gt; a clear example of believing there is some point to political parties beyond simply actioning the short-term desires of the people.

I don't see how you've made that connection.  The parties, effectively, want to buy my vote.  But they don't care about me personally, they will happily give up my vote if a change of policy that would lose me, would gain them ten.

To try an bring this back to the topic at hand... if UKIP found that adding ""we will do X"" get's them more votes, they will certainly add that.  A policy of ""we will do X if more than just our supporters are in favour"" is still a policy, and I don't understand why there is a fuss, particularly as that seems more reasonable than ""we'll do X regardless of whether there is support for it"", and certainly more democratic.",null,0,null,1422021104,null,0,false,0,cny9qop,null,t3_2ta84a,null,t1_cny9qop,null,t1_cny9d11,null,null,null,1424438997,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Secondly, it says in 1 Peter 4:8, ""love covers a multitude of sins.""

The other things you mention either originated in or were present before the second world war, while the marriage bar still existed in the civil service in the 1970s! Not to mention these rights had to be fought for when no one ever had to fight for the 'value' of pretending we're not bothered by things. But I could be missing some of your other new, shiny values, I read your comment last night and thought I'd express my amusement at that and forgot the rest. 

In all honesty it seemed utterly ridiculous to me that you would imply that we as a country are not similar to many other advanced capitalist democracies in regards to gender equality to the point you think it's an innate value. It's not particularly British. No one talks about royalty, crumpets, and the equal pay act.  

British values are tied up in these idyllic notions of a by gone era in which no one could sensibly argue that gender equality had any part to play. 

Perhaps if you were arguing for a redefinition of British values for the modern age then maybe gender equality would have more of a part to play, but then so would racial equality, freedom to practice whatever religion you choose (and not 'you can have any religion as long as it's christian') and an open society that accepts difference and similarity rather than trying to pin down what 'British' is. 

In short, bollocks is gender equality a British value traditionally or in the modern age in my eyes, and to imply so is to ignore the fact that this 'value' was and still is fought for across the world. Great progress has been made, but let's not imply the fight is over by paying lip service to it and pretending it was always there and that it's just a British thing.

That's the really annoying thing about it all.

These laws keep coming back. Sometimes with newer wording and better timing. Sometimes as emergency legislation. Sometimes amended onto another law at the last minute.

The question it makes you ask is why does it always happen this way with this particular type of legislation?

I have a particular interest in this, as I've a child with CP, and she once did a exercise for staff in our local hospital about how they treat kids with communication difficulties. Generally, hospitals have no specific communication policies, and this has led in the past to another kid I know getting some seriously shonky treatment as the staff didn't know how to ask him how he felt, or how to communicate with him at all, thus they had to rely on his mother as a conduit. Poor decisions were made on the basis of fear of litigation, and the lad in question got worse before he got better.

After the second investigation by the IPCC, (Stockwell 2) they applied pressure for the resignation of Ian Blair due to his conduct.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Jean_Charles_de_Menezes

He's also responsible for the Forrest Gate shootings.

Called for, and lobbied for 90 day prisoner detention of terror suspects.

In a BBC Radio 4 interview Blair stated that Islamic terrorism ""is a far graver threat in terms of civilians than either the Cold War or the Second World War"". Civilians killed in World War II totalled around 47 million. (What a twat)

When he was Commissioner of the Met a 30 year buddy 'won' an IT contract with the Met worth £3m. Same buddy also won an no bid PR contract worth £15k.

Secretly recorded telephone conversations with the Attorney General.

No idea how he slimed his way to the top, shit floats I guess.

Addendum: It may also be interesting to note, the person in charge of the botched surveilance which led to Mr Menezes murder, was Cressida Dick. She's now Assistant Commissioner of the Met Police and is on the Council of the for-profit private corporation, and quasi political plod, ACPO.

---

&gt;

&gt;Scientists have reported tardigrades in [hot springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_spring), on top of the [Himalayas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas), under layers of solid [ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice), and in ocean sediments. Many species can be found in milder environments such as lakes, ponds, and [meadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meadow), while others can be found in stone walls and roofs. Tardigrades are most common in moist environments, but can stay active wherever they can retain at least some moisture.

&gt;Tardigrades are one of the few groups of species that are capable of reversibly suspending their [metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism) and going into a state of [cryptobiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptobiosis). Several species regularly survive in a dehydrated state for nearly 10 years. Depending on the environment, they may enter this state via [anhydrobiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhydrobiosis), [cryobiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryobiosis), [osmobiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmobiosis), or [anoxybiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anoxybiosis). While in this state, their metabolism lowers to less than 0.01% of normal and their water content can drop to 1% of normal. Their ability to remain desiccated for such a long period is largely dependent on the high levels of the nonreducing sugar [trehalose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trehalose), which protects their [membranes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane). In this cryptobiotic state, the tardigrade is known as a tun. 

&gt;Tardigrades are able to [survive in extreme environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile) that would kill almost any other animal, including:

&gt;


&gt;* [Temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature) – tardigrades can survive being heated for a few minutes to 151 °C (304 °F),  or being chilled for days at −200 °C (-328 °F).  Some can even survive cooling to −272 °C (~1 degree above [absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero) or -458 °F)  for a few minutes.

&gt;* [Pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure) – they can withstand the extremely low pressure of a [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum) and also very high pressures, more than 1,200 times [atmospheric pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure). Tardigrades can survive the vacuum of open space and solar radiation combined for at least 10 days.  Some species can also withstand pressure of 6,000 atmospheres, which is nearly six times the pressure of water in the deepest ocean trench, the [Mariana trench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_trench). 

&gt;* [Dehydration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration) – the longest that living tardigrades have been shown to survive in a dry state is nearly 10 years,   although there is one report of a leg movement, not generally considered ""survival"",  in a 120-year-old specimen from dried moss.  When exposed to extremely low temperatures, their body composition goes from 85% water to only 3%. As water expands upon freezing, dehydration ensures the tardigrades do not get ripped apart by the freezing ice. 

&gt;* [Radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation) – tardigrades can withstand 1,000 times more radiation than other animals,  median lethal doses of 5,000 [Gy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit\)) (of gamma rays) and 6,200 Gy (of heavy ions) in hydrated animals (5 to 10 Gy could be fatal to a human).  The only explanation found in earlier experiments for this ability was that their lowered water state provides fewer reactants for the [ionizing radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation).  However, subsequent research found that tardigrades, when hydrated, still remain highly resistant to shortwave [UV radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_radiation) in comparison to other animals, and that one factor for this is their ability to efficiently repair damage to their DNA resulting from that exposure. 

&gt;&gt;Irradiation of tardigrade eggs collected directly from a natural substrate (moss) showed a clear dose-related response, with a steep decline in hatchability at doses up to 4 kGy, above which no eggs hatched.  The eggs were more tolerant to radiation late in development. No eggs irradiated at the early developmental stage hatched, and only one egg at middle stage hatched, while eggs irradiated in the late stage hatched at a rate indistinguishable from controls. 

&gt;


&gt;* [Environmental toxins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicant) – tardigrades can undergo chemobiosis, a [cryptobiotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptobiosis) response to high levels of environmental toxins. However, as of 2001, these laboratory results have yet to be verified.  

&gt;* [Outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space) – tardigrades are the first known animal to survive in space. On September 2007, dehydrated tardigrades were taken into [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit) on the [FOTON-M3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foton-M) mission carrying the [BIOPAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOPAN) astrobiology payload. For 10 days, groups of tardigrades were exposed to the [hard vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_vacuum) of outer space, or vacuum and solar [UV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV) radiation.    After being rehydrated back on Earth, over 68% of the subjects protected from high-energy UV radiation revived within 30 minutes following rehydration, but subsequent mortality was high; many of these produced viable embryos.   In contrast, dehydrated samples exposed to the combined effect of vacuum and full solar UV radiation had significantly reduced survival, with only three subjects of *[Milnesium tardigradum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milnesium_tardigradum)* surviving.  In May 2011, Italian scientists sent tardigrades on board the International Space Station along with other extremophiles on [STS-134](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-134), the final flight of [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle) [*Endeavour*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Endeavour).    Their conclusion was that microgravity and cosmic radiation ""did not significantly affect survival of tardigrades in flight, confirming that tardigrades represent a useful animal for space research.""  In November 2011, they were among the organisms to be sent by the US-based [Planetary Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_Society) on the Russian [Fobos-Grunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fobos-Grunt) mission's [Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Interplanetary_Flight_Experiment) to [Phobos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_(moon\)); however, the launch failed.

I don't know enough about this as it isn't my area, but that seems to mean an inconvenience of a similar nature to when banks all threaten to leave en masse when the country makes a policy decision that affects them. It creates an inconvenience, not a ban on the industry itself. 

A lot of this seems to be ""no research can possibly happen without animal testing"", which isn't true. It would definitely have an effect yes. Would Pharma companies want to stay? How many more liberal countries are there than us on these regulations where GSK could run their operations securely? Why don't they run their research there already? 

This is a more complex question that has ramifications across a lot of areas and not just ""Business must always be allowed to do what it wants all the time or we will go back to living in hovels in the ground"". We definitely can't have our cake of free markets, low labour protection, business friendly tax etc and then eat it with ethical policy, high labour laws, high tax etc etc. Life's about compromise.


&gt;It's a joke and the fact that the Greens have always failed to address this issue when asked is why pretty much everyone in the Industry will not vote green.

That's understandable I guess, and i guess there's other groups who aren't fans either just like many are not fans of specific Conservative or UKIP policies due to their own interests.

The continued denial of equal marriage rights to all consenting adults in Northern Ireland makes us a laughing stock. Even the USA are winning the fight against religious conservatism where this point of equality is concerned.

Gay people, just like many other minorities, are specifically given special protection by the law - they need this protection, because otherwise you'd have countries like Northern Ireland making it legal by majority to discriminate against them based on irrational positions (this is why, even if the Conscience Clause makes it through Stormont, it'll be challenged, brought before the EU, and shot down there). 

When gay people try to exercise or fight for the rights they should be entitled to, they are chastised for rocking the boat, destroying ""traditional marriage"" or the ""family structure"", and their voices and struggles are minimised or ignored entirely as a result. As it turns out, refusing to print a message that the legal system ultimately endorses (even if the legislature hasn't caught up), and specifically, doing it because you think gay people don't deserve equal rights, can be interpreted as conveying the opposite message: shut down gay marriage. Keep it illegal. 

This is an exercise of homophobia, even if it has wishy-washy (and entirely legally unsupportable) ""strongly held religious convictions"" behind it, and is being shown to be as much by the people who think that openly supporting institutionalised discrimination against gay people is only as bad as not making a cock-shaped cake.",null,0,null,1422024483,null,0,false,0,cnyb6l2,null,t3_2tcv6z,null,t1_cnyb6l2,null,t1_cny9uw0,null,null,null,1424438329,null,-2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,-2,null

Greens in-fighting over council tax rise, which the leader wants to introduce to tackle local crises, such as bin collections - apparently Brighton has gone from having one of the best recycling records in the country to one of the worst, under the Green Party led council. 


Other things I have also learned are:

1. They tried to ban bin men from eating bacon sandwiches on a Friday, as part of a meat-free day (failed)

2. They use sheep to graze on grass on the Downs instead of a lawnmower (seems a good idea, IMO)

3. Also wanted to let sheep wander near roads to slow down traffic (abandoned)

4. They have hired a counsellor to stop internal fighting in the Green Party

5. They wanted to ban swimming on Brighton Beach on Christmas Day for health and safety reasons (gone ignored)

6. They wanted to cut down an old elm tree to make way for a cycle path. Some in the party disagreed, and the partner of one councillor chained themselves to the tree. The tree is still there.

7. They want lorries to stop for one minute if they exceed emission targets (to be decided)

I used to work for 118118 (before they closed all of their UK call centres) and we were required to be on the phone and available to take calls for at least 97% of our shift. This amounted to about 10 mins a day in which you could go to the toilet for full time staff and 6 mins a day for part time staff. On a weekly basis, falling below the 97% would lose you your ""bonus"" and if you did so more than 3 times in 6 months you would be invited to a disciplinary hearing. 

Calls would be more or less constant with no break in between, so drinking a large amount of water was absolutely vital to save your voice. Of course, getting up to get a drink was included in your time off the phone, so between get drinks and pissing them out again you could very quickly go over your limit. 

Call centres, in my experience, treat their staff like a combination of children and cattle. I hope I never have to go back to one as long as I live.

A country is a geo-political entity not a legal entity and can also be a sovereign state (such as the United States or France which are both countries and sovereign states) or it can be occupied by a sovereign state (such as Guam, Gibraltar, or the Falklands). These countries which are occupied or part of a larger sovereign nation may have a certain degree of autonomy given to them by the central government of the nation state (such as the Scottish Parliament).

Couple this with javascript/flash used to expose internal routing and addressing, and a VPN becomes almost a redundant step.

Of course the VPNs people tend to talk about on threads such as this are privacy-orientated. Which are of course, a lot better and can be expected to perform additional steps to attempt to ensure user anonymity.

Maybe I was being a bit pushy on what could be classed as subjective there so let me explain my reasoning. We can ""just ignore it"" when people are being publicly sexist or racist or homophobic but many people feel the way you change that is by engaging with it. 

They are starting from an assumption that ""just ignore it"" isn't an option so if you are just going to say ""you can just ignore it"" clearly they are just going to come back with ""but that's not an option"" rendering the first part practically pointless as a starting point for the debate.  

&gt;As for the ""should"" line of reasoning, I don't understand the point you are making. It seems to be word play.

Me choosing not to do something because I feel I shouldn't is distinctly diffrent to me not doing something I otherwise would because I can't. Lots of people now say it's censorship when people are put under social pressures to not say something but it uncommon (even in this country) for there to be things that the law simply bans me from saying. 

The important point is that even if social pressures make me feel I can't voice a given opinion even if I personally would if social pressures were diffrent I still *could* voice that opinion if I was willing to accept the social consequences. So, so long as the opinion isn't outright banned it has the potential to be voiced and make its case which could result in a public debate that changes the prevailing social pressures. It happens all the time and it's not something I feel we should be conflating with the idea of fundamental rights.  

This is what is meant by the phrase ""freedom of speech is not freedom from consequence"" just because I could doesn't mean I should even if I may otherwise would.

I agree with your desire to move the discussion more to the matter at hand. Perhaps I'll try another hypothetical:

Suppose UKIP said, ""We're not officially in favour of banning criticism of the government, but if enough people support it then we would seriously consider making speech critical of the government illegal"". Would you not feel that the *implication* here is that quite a lot of UKIP members were in favour of a pretty backwards policy (especially since the leader has gone on record as saying he would prefer a system where the government couldn't be criticised)? The public are manifestly not in favour of such a policy, there is no chance at all that the public *would* be in favour of such a policy between now and the next election and anything that could concievably cause the public to be in favour of mass censorship of anti-government material in the next five years would surely be so catastrophic any responsible government would call a snap election.

Ok, you'll have to work with me a bit on the example (I needed to find something obviously wrong to illustrate the point when privatising the NHS is not obviously wrong, although I think a consideration of the evidence suggests it is wrong for the UK), but can you see from the example why some people might argue that such a policy reflects an implicit deprioritisation of the NHS by UKIP?

What's more, some people will see this as an attempt to sneak privatisation in through the back door. Consider; when UKIP come to power they have free reign to define 'people in favour' however they want; perhaps they believe most people *are* in favour of privatising the NHS, but are scared of speaking out because of the powerful doctors' lobby. Perhaps they believe 5% of people being in favour is a good enough majority, because the 95% of people who aren't in favour don't understand the issues well enough. Perhaps (most likely) they will argue that people are in favour of privatising *this particular service* (cardiac care in Manchester, say) and hence privatise the system piecemeal. Note that I'm not saying that that's UKIP's clear goal, I'm just saying that it is reasonable to read a policy as saying, ""X, unless Y"" as less strongly comitting a party to something than a policy which says, ""X"". Many people suspect UKIP really do want to privatise the NHS, so they are very worried about policy which appears to give them mechanisms to do so.",null,0,null,1422027701,null,0,false,0,cnycuwm,null,t3_2ta84a,null,t1_cnycuwm,null,t1_cny9qop,null,null,null,1424437543,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

&gt;__The Football Association Challenge Cup__, known worldwide as the __FA Cup__, is an annual [knockout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament) cup competition in [English football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England); it is the oldest association football competition in the world.  The FA Cup is organised by and named after [the Football Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association). A concurrent women's tournament is also held, known as the [FA Women's Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Women%27s_Cup).

&gt;The FA Cup was first held in [1871–72](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1871%E2%80%9372_FA_Cup). Entry is open to all teams who compete in the [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League), the [Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League) and in [Steps 1 to 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_System#The_system) of the FA [National League System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_System), as well as selected teams in Step 6.  This means that clubs of all standards compete, from the largest clubs in England and Wales down to amateur village teams. The tournament has become known for the possibility for ""[minnows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdog_(competition\))"" from the lower divisions to become ""giant-killers"" by eliminating top clubs from the tournament and even theoretically winning the Cup, although lower division teams rarely progress beyond the early stages. The qualification rounds and a system of [byes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bye_(sport\)) mean that the very smallest and very biggest teams almost never meet.

&gt;[Arsenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.) are the current holders, having beaten [Hull City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_City_A.F.C.) 3–2 after extra time in the [2014 final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FA_Cup_Final). With their 11th FA Cup title, Arsenal are now level with Manchester United for the greatest number of title victories in the history of the competition.

There is no party platform released yet, so as of yet a one issue party (anti-EU).  I can't find a definitive study but roughly 50% of Brits say they want to leave EU.  They are the closest approximation to the Tea Party in the US.

As for European elections, they have very low turn out.. in 2014 only 34% of eligible voters bothered to vote.  This is how smaller parties (like UKIP) can do so well.  In this case only 4 million people voted UKIP.  The larger issue/concern is the low turn out but most people do not see EU elections are very important, unless they are against the EU and then vote UKIP.  

EU membership itself is a very long topic.  Simply put EU membership includes free trade and movement of people.  The free movement of people into UK is what UKIP takes issue with, despite study after study showing they help our economy and do not cause pay deflation (is negligible for low income at £5/week, actually helps mid/high level) and take less benefits than Brits.  The next argument is the stress more people put on housing and services, which is a valid argument.

Matilda - Was Holy Roman Empress, before leading the ultimately successful side in a civil war in England, all in the 12th Century. 

Jane - Shortest ever reign, if you accept that she was ever Queen.

Mary I - The first joint-monarch, and still remembered as Bloody Mary for her religious persecution of protestants. 

Elizabeth I - Oversaw the flourishing of English drama, sea power and military confidence. Has a lasting impact on public perception of the time - the Elizabethan Age.

Mary II - The second joint-monarch, and the jointly the first Monarch appointed by Parliament. 

Anne - Oversaw the Union of England and Scotland to form Great Britain. 

Victoria - Oversaw the massive expansion of British power and influence worldwide, the rise of Britain as a superpower. Also gave her name to the Victorian Age.

Elizabeth II - has overseen the rapid decolonization of the British Empire, the rise of the Commonwealth and one of the fastest periods of change in history.

Would you not feel that the implication here is that quite a lot of UKIP members were in favour of a pretty backwards policy

I personally would yes; but if you believe in democracy (and as it happens we're getting close to touching on the reasons I think democracy is broken), then if enough people agreed with them then those of us that thought it was ""backwards"" would have to put up with it wouldn't we?  The problem is that to you (and I) ""no government criticism"" is backward, but people find a great many political party's policies ""backward"" -- so we can't use that as a criteria for reasonableness of policy.

As we've touched on it, I'll state my position: democracy is broken for exactly the reason you touch on here.  Democracy is simply the tyranny of the majority -- if 51% of people voted for a party with ""no more criticism of the government"", then a democratic country could reasonably enact that.

&gt; What's more, some people will see this as an attempt to sneak privatisation in through the back door.

Some people will, yes, but if the condition is ""when the electroate find it acceptable"", then those ""some people"" are out of luck aren't they?

&gt; ""X, unless Y"" as less strongly comitting a party to something than a policy which says, ""X""

Agreed.  As I said; I think they're a bit wet for putting it like that.  A political party should set its stall out and see what the electorate buys in on.  If your policy isn't liked -- tough.  If it's just that you are embarassed by your policy, then you don't really deserve to be in power -- being embarassed is going to come with the job, and if you don't think you're right, don't have that as a poilcy.

Yes, lets continue to shit on Navas, who was the only player vs. Arsenal who actually got the ball into a position to put in a ball to Aguero with any regularity and ignore the players who couldn't actually even do that much. Lets ignore the defence who all went missing for the second goal, lets just blame Navas.

Milner on the other hand was completely invisible playing against an 18 y/o third choice RB, and deservedly got the hook at half time because he was just a spectator. Even Silva couldn't actually manage to do anything positive with the ball, and Jovetic actually spurned the only two chances we created all game - including one from a fantastic Navas cross - which he should have scored and let us nick points in a game we deserved to lose.

Navas put crosses in because that's what he's told to do. He's not creative, and surprise surprise when Arsenal pack the box and his only target is 5'10, the crosses go to defenders not Aguero.

He'll play tomorrow, because actually despite being shit last week he was still one of our better attacking players.

TASER is not to be used in a public order situation or carried by level 2 public order officer or level 1 officers when deployed on public order duty (that is to say those you would recognise as ""riot officers."" There is good reason for this. Again trying to deploy it in a crowd, not a good idea. People panic and the situation tends to escalate, another problem is if you deploy it (get your target) then you need to remove the barbs. The crowd probably won't want to let you get the subject in order to remove them, explaining the issue, probably not going to work.

2) CSing people in a riot/ugly protest is not always a good idea nor is it a legitimate option. It spreads like anything, it is not very directional. If you sprayed 1 person in a crowd you'll probably end up affecting about 20, and police officers are not immune to it. Probably not a good idea to take out your hole serial, many doughnuts and coffees will have to be purchased by way of apology. Oh and the line might fail and then you could have a really serious situation but you know, doughnuts. The met does not and never has used pepper spray. Some forces in this country do use a synthetic version called PAVA.

Yes, because that would certainly explain how the English Helen Saville Roberts has been selected to stand in the safe seat of Dwyfor Meirionydd, or other Englishman Mike Parker is standing in the winnable seat of Ceredigion. It would also explain how they had the first non-white, non-British Isles born Assembly Member.

Whether you think their policies are ""moronic"" is your own choice, but personally I think UKIP's policies are moronic so that is no reason not to include them in the debate.

From the link:
&gt; Wales has a unique linguistic heritage, a breathtaking landscape, and a fascinating history. Since its inception as a political party, Plaid has fought for the rights of Welsh speakers, and for the preservation of our national identity. Culture, media, heritage and sport are vitally important to us all because they are not only about enjoyment and celebration but they are about motivation and personal development. This shapes our identity, and our sense of who we are. Culture creates our sense of place, our feelings of community, and our view of our place in the world. 

What exactly is BNP-esque about that? I checked the BNP website (I fell really filthy for doing do) and they claim to oppose multiculturalism. Plaid do not, they merely want our own culture to survive, they have no problem with people from other cultures.

Adebayor makes £170,000 a week. Gets given captaincy and a second chance. He should be the star player. 

Eriksen makes £75,000 a week.

Townsend makes £16,000 a week

Kane makes approx. £7,000 a week.

When Adebayor sorts out his attitude, his work ethic and starts contributing to the team as much as anyone earning even a tenth of his salary, then maybe people's opinions will change.....

So from a somewhat statistical financial perspective, booing him to convey the fans annoyance makes sense. Perhaps it will change the situation.

At the same time, the whole ""support your team through thick and thin"" argument stands. When a player does well, we should support them as much as we do when they do badly - aka do when we do to Soldado. 

The difference between Soldado and Adebayor though is that work ethic, that personal connection, the knowledge he is human and just like anyone else. He wants to do well. Adebayor doesn't have that character.

Whilst a warrant can be obtained via a judge. The bill also allows a senior police officer to approve access to internet subscriber data. 

The bill also contains provisions for the Home Secretary to :-

1.Authorise access by any other government department, not just the police/security services. 
2. Designate who can authorise access to internet subscriber data, not just a judge or senior police officer.

The bill, as written, does not provide any reasonable safe guards against abuse of the data. 

Also, you imply (I might have misread your meaning) that content-free data is nothing much to worry about. But that is not true for anyone who spends a reasonable time on the Internet (or uses a smartphone). Content-free data provides an incredibly detailed picture of someones life. 

How about a fun example, using your reddit comment history to impute some ""content-free"" data.

Kane is on effectively his first pro-contract (even with the contract re-up we did with him recently) until this season we were paying Kane on his potential same with Eriksen, Andros and even Jan (who is reportedly on something like £36k/wk)....at the time they signed contracts they hadn't proven their ability in the PL so they get less salary.

Ade got his contract from his previous performance and pay level, same with Lennon (£55k/wk), Kaboul (£45k/wk?) and many others....Should they be performing at a higher level?...yes...but that isn't the way contracts are worked out....

In the end i am sure we will offer pay raises to players to keep them around (we supposedly offered Eriksen ~£60k/wk but he is deferring contract talks until season end)....which is one reason we need to clear some of the contracts off the deck.

Personally while i agree with the sentiment and as much as i am not a fan of Ade.....i *want* him to perform for the club and support him when he is on the pitch.  I may hate his wage, his attitude, work ethic or any number of things that people raise about him.....but he still is a member of the squad and in the end i just want success from the players on the pitch (as that hopefully translates to success in the table) regardless of who they are or my personal opinion of them....",null,0,null,1422031747,null,0,false,0,cnyf9o3,null,t3_2tevp3,null,t1_cnyf9o3,null,t1_cnyemsn,null,null,null,1424436409,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

4. We'd have to start paying more diplomats to take over Royal functions
5. We'd have to start paying for expensive head of state elections
6. If we had a strong head of state (France/US) the conflict between them and the Commons (as we frequently see in those nations) would paralyse our political system.
7. If we had a weak head of state (Germany/Ireland) we'd be paying a ton of extra money for someone to do the current job the Queen is doing except this time they're not politically neutral.
8. A head of state not beholden to political whims of the masses is less likely to fall under the spell of a rising extremist party and can thusly stop the extremist government by refusing to consent to their actions/law. It's a last chance mutually assured destruction option that could save the country.

* SF (with advantage) in the League Cup, with a very good shot at a trip to Wembley
* R32 of Europa Leauge
* Still in the League Cup.

Are you saying Orange Protestantism and Green Catholicism are not culturally distinct? Because that's a bold, bold claim. I think your coming at this from the modern plurality demographics NI has now as opposed to the massive 70/30 majority Protestantism had in NI in 1921. NI is in effect no different to any Yugoslavian successor state that was only held together from 1801-1921 because of the large neighbour and had no history of being an independent single nation.

Edit: I read through some of your other recent comments on other threads and this jumped out at me ""British did a terrible job at running Ireland "" Yes they did, ""and just as bad a job at running NI after it was split off"" this second part means you do not understand the history of NI in any accurate detail, the British army made mistakes in there actions in NI after the start of troubles however the British government had no hand in the running of NI from it's founding until 1971 and Stormont being dissolved, the British had issued a statement in 1921 saying ""We will leave Ireland to the Irish"" and only NI politicians were involved in running of the state (Which ironically is why it ended up so bad was the lack of oversight from the mainland).

with that said, the only point i have to make is that rossiter is 17. if he is ready physically and mentally to compete with full grown men, sure fine (ibe and sterling both can certainly do that, at 17 they both were physically very strong), don't shield him, blood him and get him aclimatised to our team. if he is not, play him against some lesser competition and build him up. the psychology aspect of a player cannot be understated. it must be of paramount importance, and it is a skill that i think br certainly has shown he can employ to devastating effect. we have lots of young players that he is working with daily in training, putting them on the bench, etc etc...putting a 17 year old on the bench, 9/10 with BR isn't to give them substantial minutes or anything like that, but more often used as an incentive, to give them a feel of what it's like to be a professional...motivation if you will to get to that level. anyways i know im beating a dead horse adn probably singing to the choir because we're on the same page, but if rossiter is ready physically and mentally, he needs to be challenged or he won't grow. pressure is always there",null,0,null,1422033320,null,0,false,0,cnyg90s,null,t3_2tc04g,null,t1_cnyg90s,null,t1_cnxtyml,null,null,null,1424435946,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

We really need a few more new towns, but ideally we should have started them 20 years ago. You can throw up a few houses in no time, but creating a town takes a lot longer. There are already parts of the country with plenty of empty houses, but no jobs or facilities.

I do own a house. I bought it at the end of the 90s before the boom started. I was actually worried that the market might fall again, but we needed more space when we started a family.

Overturned due to all of them being down to the fault of the advisor who pushed them through. On bringing it up with the advisor in question I was accused of starting an argument even though I've never once raised my voice. I even put in a formal complaint through the jobcentres complaint procedure and my full written complaint ended up on the desk of the advisor that pushed them all through, which only led to further problems not far down the line, mainly that they kept sending my post to completely random addresses and then accused myself of telling them that I lived at those addresses, yet they couldn't produce the paperwork to show that was the case (and anybody that has been through that zoo knows that *everything* requires paperwork).

Funnily enough when I actually did move address earlier last year they claimed they hadn't received it, even though that was handed in in person and I had the evidence to show it was.. It turned up a week later on the desk of that one awful advisor). On moving address this month (the 6th), I'm 11 days after my last payment was due and it hasn't been sorted out yet. 

That advisor in question didn't even work directly for the jobcentre, but for Avanta - The work program. For some completely fucked up reason the people there have full rights to issue sanctions even though they don't have access to the jobcentre systems. All sanctions get sent to some central location where they're automatically approved without checks. You then have 2 weeks to appeal to this centre who will, in turn, automatically deny your appeal (again, this happened 10 times to myself when I had clear evidence).

It's only once you throw in a second written appeal at the jobcentre itself that another department will take it up and if you're lucky, will actually look into the matter and make a decision (they used to have a time limit of 4 weeks to get back to you, that has been lifted due to the volume of appeals and there's no longer a time limit to get back to anyone, they tell you that on average it will take 6 weeks).

But oftentimes even those wont look into it and will write to you advising you that your appeal has failed. It was at those times I'd start writing emails and letters to the jobcentre complaints department whilst cc'ing in my local MP and local papers and then it would be looked at (sometimes).

null,false,tomintheshire,eng-devon,Still better then Cornwall,null,"&gt; I don't know enough about this as it isn't my area, but that seems to mean an inconvenience 

&gt;It creates an inconvenience, not a ban on the industry itself.

Its not an inconvenience when you cant even do groundbreaking research. This isnt something that they would prefer to remain the same through ease of business. They want it to remain the same because **it is their business**.

For example

* Without animal testing you cant find out if a drug is lethal on living organisms, unless you doing shit loads of predictive modelling and then finally when you do human trials, you hope your years of meticulous planning and all the money you spend on R&amp;D will allow this drug to work. But then when you go to test on a living organism (which would be phase 1/2 trials on humans, not animals remember) and it doesnt work, well then your screwed. All that money spent and all that time to produce something which doesnt even work. 

* With animal testing. Do the same simple cell tests on tumours. If it works then you test on a living organism - first mice and then when you think its ready, test on primates - and it doesnt work? no worries as you spent relatively little time and money doing the tests.

See what I mean? Its terrible for a business to invest so much money into doing complicated and limited testing only to find it not work, when you could just ** go to a different country and do the same work, quicker, for a fraction of the cost**. Who in their right minds would run a company in a way that is overtly expensive?

**British pharma brings in around £14.6 billion**, why would it be feasible to dent a huge contributor to the GDP for the sake of animal testing.

&gt;A lot of this seems to be ""no research can possibly happen without animal testing"", which isn't true.

Ok then, tell me 

* How to do Cancer research without in vivo models? 

*  Where Im going to get all the pancreatic tissue to do diabetes research?

* How i'm going to create all these antibodies to be used in testing for cystic fibrosis/cancer/phenylketonuria?

&gt; This is a more complex question that has ramifications across a lot of areas and not just ""Business must always be allowed to do what it wants all the time or we will go back to living in hovels in the ground""

Right here you just flat out ignore the huge effects this has on British academic research. Universities dont outsource, they create through funding. No funding group would bother to fund research in a British university lab because they know the results they get are not significant and they can do it cheaper in another country.

I understand it's not your area, but im willing to cite you countless papers showing how vastly animal models are used in day to day testing. **it's not an inconvience, its a destructive force.**

The woman was previously verbally abusive towards the hospital staff (on the day and several times previously) and had had been banned from the ward as she was trying to interfere with the treatment of the child(Or at the very least Staff members feared this due to her aggressive behaviour).  When hospital staff had asked her to leave, she didn't, the police were called because of this.

When the officer arrived, knowing the woman was abusive and threatened to remove the child from treatment, it looked like she was interfering with the child by trying to remove the hospital equipment on the childs arm.

The woman was being verbally abusive and posed a risk of physical abuse to the hospital staff. They had banned her from the ward and she was trying to interfere with her kids treatment by taking her out of the hospital which could have led to the death of the kid. That's why they called the police in the first place.


I fail to see the problem, If a police officer asks you to do something nicely, you comply, talk it over and take it from there.  The officer feared for the child and when the woman wouldn't let go he escalated the level of violence to resolve the issue.


While having a sick child is stressful, being abusive towards staff is inexcusable and lead to this outcome.  No sympathy at all for the woman in regards to her beating.

 I think these measures are going to be abused (even if the people passing these bills have no intention of abusing it, that doesn't mean the next party in power won't) but the average guy on the street is going to care about this as much as they do about some crisis going on in a faraway country, they are going to think it's bad, but they aren't going to care enough to do much about it because it doesn't really affect them.

&gt;There is no party platform released yet, so as of yet a one issue party (anti-EU).

While that is obviously the main issue, they seem to be heading towards having a lot more policies, you can see some of them in more detail [here](http://www.ukip.org/policies_for_people)

&gt;They are the closest approximation to the Tea Party in the US.

Close, but I'd view UKIP slightly less negatively for various reasons.

&gt;As for European elections, they have very low turn out.. in 2014 only 34% of eligible voters bothered to vote. This is how smaller parties (like UKIP) can do so well. In this case only 4 million people voted UKIP. The larger issue/concern is the low turn out but most people do not see EU elections are very important, unless they are against the EU and then vote UKIP.

Pretty much correct here since it's just facts, UKIP tend to have slightly more loyal supporters as shown by the poll that popped up last week.

&gt;despite study after study showing they help our economy and do not cause pay deflation (is negligible for low income at £5/week, actually helps mid/high level) and take less benefits than Brits. 

While this is mostly true, it does cause issues for low earners due to the fact immigration will obviously drive down the wages of certain lower paying jobs.
It goes further than that though, as a Kipper I take the point that we could still continue to let through those that will contribute to our economy and society, those which are coming with no intention to work, people with a criminal record, etc could be prevented from coming even if they are in a minority, that would allow us to benefit even further from immigration by only letting in the good apples.

&gt;The key here is that right leaning parties (Tory/UKIP) have no intention to address these issues (preferring to privatise, keep government out of it...).

I'm not quite sure what you mean with this bit, I'd say UKIP(and even the Tories) are already addressing the fact that immigration puts a strain on housing and services.

null,false,steviematty,null,null,null,"I know a few people who i used to go to college with who work in a warehouse in the UK. It is a huge warehouse and if you need the toilet there is lot of distance to cover but not much time. 

Not only that but there are security measures in place. When they leave the warehouse floor they need to be checked to make sure no stealing is going on. The (big British supermarket) does this by making them walk through metal detectors but the workers are required to wear safety boots for health and safety. This means that boots and belts need to be taken off while they're frisked and then put back on again. There is then a set if huge stairs for them to go up if they haven't already pissed or shit themselves in the time it takes.

While there is no allowance limiting their visits to the toilet per se. They are timed strictly according to how many items/packages they pick per shift/hour. It is very difficult for them to hit their targets without going to the toilet let alone by going to it. A simple trip to the toilet takes 10-15 minutes and that is if you only spend 1-2 minutes on the actual toilet. Another thing is that the work is very labour intensive and obviously requires consumption of plenty of water during an 8 hour shift.

A few of them have several hours of pay docked every month. i asked if this happens to co-workers and it does. I tell them to leave but in northern England there aren't many jobs. The warehouse managers know this so treat them like shit/slaves because they know they can. The managers do this because they have unrealistic targets to hit too and don't have the balls or want to risk their own job by telling their superiors.

The only ones that don't get pay docked are ones that break health and safety rules by taking shortcuts along aisles that are reserved for forklifts speeding along. There have been accidents involving crushed feet and legs too.

The reason none of the workers complain is because the big British supermarket i am on about uses agencies but these agencies have long-term contracts with the warehouse. This means that they're hired ""full-time"" but have zero hour contracts. If someone tries to complain they quickly see their hours drop from 40+ to 0 hours. Another thing is that half of the agency workers are Polish  and have little knowledge of their rights.

The not so funny thing is that a worker in this warehouse died in 2012 or 2013 if i remember correctly but the company brushed it under the carpet and paid off the family to avoid a proper investigation. 

I can only think that this is going on in warehouses up and down the country but health snd safety investigators are simply not independent enough from the companies they're monitoring or receiving their own ""bonuses"" in some way or another.

So I just watched this episode and I am so disturbed and no one seems to be talking about it, I had to come here and see if anyone else can put me at ease.

The premise is that for all of human history, death hasn't really been final. There was an 'afterlife' controlled by The Master which ALL OF HUMANITY was being funneled into so that one day he could resurrect them as CyberMan.... Neither the Doctor nor anyone seems all that struck by the huge impact of this. 

EVERYONE THE DOCTOR EVER MET WHO DIED ON EARTH HAD THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS STILL IN THIS SYSTEM. The Doctor only seemed concerned about Danny's consciousness being trapped... what about Amy and Rory Pond, for starters? As the Doctor had his little showdown in the grave yard, somewhere in a New York graveyard, the Amy and Rory Cybermen were standing waiting for their orders. And if Danny was able to not have his memory/humanity deleted due to love... do we really think his love was any stronger than Amy and Rory’s? They were probably conscious as well. Not to mention the many tens of thousands of other couples throughout history who have had intense love.

Danny then orders all Cybermen zombie humans to kill themselves in the clouds... and the Doctor is sad for Danny... but what about the millions, no billions of others who for the first time in tens of thousands of years were now officially dead? All 'deaths' in the Who series before that moment (on earth at least) didn't ""count"" because their consciousness was locked away in the Master controlled afterlife. Only at that point when the zombie Cybermen killed themselves in the clouds did those billion human souls/consciousnesses finally die. This was the largest onscreen genocide Doctor who... or any show in the history of television, has ever shown. Any human ever previously thought dead over thousands of years (approximately 125 billion humans have lived and died on earth so far), was actually alive (or at least conscious), until that exact moment. Billions upon billions of people. And The Doctor didn't even take a moment to try to find a way to save them. HE LET AMY POND DIE FOR REAL THIS TIME.

I just... I couldn't wrap my head around that concept and how the other characters didn't really seem to understand the impact of what just happened. Doctor Who just participated in the largest genocide in the universe.

'Orange Protestants' are going to be back to being a minority in a 'Green Catholic' state within a couple of decades, partition or no partition, so the whole exercise divided a country and caused a lot of pain and suffering for no reason.

First, booing doesn't convey anything except to the player. Just the mere fact that he's on ridiculous wages is enough for Levy &amp; Co to decide that they should offload him. Conveying annoyance doesn't do anything except unsettle the team, and it creates a toxic environment at the Lane. He will be sold, and we'll never hear from him again, but right now he's our goddamn player and we gotta support him. 

Second, Ade has contributed more to the club than Soldado ever has. Absolutely appalling that everyone forgets the world class performances he had in Lillywhite just because a struggling striker puts up some Instagram photos.

Is it because people think he's lazy? That argument doesn't hold up anymore. Poch would never, ever plays a player that doesn't fit his high pressing style this far into the season. He's not as fast as Soldado, but anyone that says he has not been pressing the past two games is blinded by their bias. 

Is it because he hasn't done much in his first two games back? It's funny, when **any other** player comes back into the side and have a shit performance everyone says ""he needs a run of games to get back into it, he'll be fine."" When this happens to Ade, the narrative changes - ""see? look how shit he is.""

Is it because of that bust up in the locker room? The **rumored** bust up? Not even worth discussing. 

Is it because he said fans should be more supportive after the Stoke loss? He's goddamn right, who would want to play in their own stadium if they're just gonna hear boos ringing around. 

Poch is playing him for a reason. If not for the man, people should stop booing for the fuckin club. It's absolutely disgraceful and downright embarrassing.

Entirely true, Ireland however was not a country before the British came along there had never been a history of a distinct Irish country at all at that point... I would also I would say does that not mean they can't self determinate simply because they had no history? For example a major point in the Scottish referendum debate was would Shetland vote for independence from Scotland if it happened? Theres no history of an independent Shetland, does that mean they shouldn't have the right to self determination?

The border was incredibly badly done I would agree, the commission failed to do anything substantial and didn't meet it's task at all. Also while population transfer was done at the time until the end of WWII I don't know why it wasn't attempted but I think we can all agree looking back at history it would have been immoral to do so.

Again, your looking at this in the modern view of plurality as opposed to the 1921 view where according to 70% of the population an Irish nation did not exist. I also agree a united Ireland is inevitable when NI becomes more economically stable, by then I also expect a more fedralised EU.

I think you underestimate how bad a position the ROI would be in if it had had 1/3 of the population of Ireland at the time in open civil revolt which it had openly threatened and armed itself for, the ROI would be in the same sorry state NI is in now without the backing of being propped up monetarily by the British state.

null,false,Yaverland,english,London,null,"I am a former parliamentary assistant with experience working on complex and controversial legislation. I do not think this is a bona fide attempt to pass the amendments.

1. Generally, the government lays amendments it actually wants to pass in the name of the minister leading on the bill. In this instance that's Lord Bates. He's put lots of other amendments on [the list](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2014-2015/0075/amend/ml075-II.htm) but not this one. 

2. In bill committees, MPs and peers often table amendments that they are not trying to pass. They do this to secure debating time, argue about the principles, and occasionally extract commitments from the government. They get the chance to make speeches and then withdraw the amendments without them ever going to a vote. I suspect the four peers who tabled this are trying to kick start a cross-bench movement in favour of stronger security laws. They'll use their chance to make speeches and then withdraw their amendment. (EDIT: They have since made clear that this is an earnest attempt to legalise the powers but as noted above, they are raising this without any co-operation with the government. [Source](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/22/snoopers-charter-changed-version-pass-before-election).)

3. Even if this is a genuine attempt to insert this language, it is a highly irregular way to go about it and I would bet against it surviving a vote. Peers are very aware of the role they play in making legislation and they know they aren't supposed to ram in controversial language like this. It's for the elected members in the Commons, who have the democratic mandate, to make the crucial decisions and for the Lords to focus on technical elements. This would not go down well. In the Lords, the whole House votes at Committee stage. This means hundreds of peers, who are independently minded and relatively difficult to whip, would get to express their view. I would not expect them to let this by.

4. Even if it survived the committee, the Bill needs to go *back* to the Commons, in a process known as ""ping pong"". The new clauses would almost certainly be defeated by MPs because the [Lib Dems would be whipped against it](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30870442), depriving the government of its majority, and [Labour has already said it won't support it eithe](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/11/ed-miliband-snoopers-charter-paris-attacks)r. The numbers just aren't there.

I am not close to this issue and could not tell you what they are trying to do. This is all guess work.

I'd say that depends on whether you think ethnic cleansing should be a viable and profitable policy.

It would have been farcical if in areas the Nazis had successfully ethnically cleansed the Germans would have been allowed to keep that territory.

Similarly, I don't think successfully ethnically cleansing part of Ireland is a valid justification for splitting the country. If any population transfers were to be done it should have been from Ireland to Britain of anyone who couldn't accept living in a united, independent Ireland.

null,false,Nachodolphin,null,null,null,"Hello there friend! The whole keeping track of tournaments can be very difficult even for life long fans. Try to stay with me and I'll try to give you what I know 1st off:

Barclay Premier league

This where we play most of our games 0 points for a loss 1 point for a draw and ,even though it hasn't happened for a while, 3 points for a win. In the end of the season the points are tallied up the bottom three teams are dropped down a league (relegated) the top 3 teams and the winner of the FA cup are offered a spot in next years champions league, 5th and 6th are offered Europa League(which we did last season)

The Community shield 

The winner of last years league plays against the winner of last years FA cup. Its not really much its more of a season opener. Won by Arsenal who beat Man City 

The FA cup 

A glorious event where over 750 or so teams across England compete for a spot in the final at Wembley. Knockout, with a tie you play a second game and if that game goes into a tie it goes to overtime followed by penalties. We were recently just knocked out by West Ham in a thrilling match

The Capital cup (aka the league cup aka the football league cup)

Instead of having 750 teams compete only 92 teams compete in this cup. Its a cup named after whoever decides to sponsor it (Recently its been Capital One) Its a knockout cup just like the FA cup consisting of the 10 premier league teams and the 72 clubs in the Football league. We were knocked out of this ages ago losing  3-0 to Swansea sometime in September

Champions League 

Every top club in Europe hopes to win this tournament. It takes the top side of each league in each country and tosses them into several groups. Two teams from the same country cant be in the same group. It follows the same point system as the league 3 for a win 0 for a loss 1 for a tie. The winner of the group gets the top seed 2nd place gets the 2nd seed and 3rd place gets into the knockout stage of Europa League. 4th place Gets nothings. This is followed by a knock out stage. Each round each team places the team they were drawn against at home and away. The scores of the game are added together and the winner of the two ""legs"" moves to the next round. For example Team 1 plays the 1st game at home winning 2-1 the second game the lose 1-3. Team twos total goals is 4 while team 1 has 3. Team 2 moves to the next round. In event of a tie in goals whoever scores the most away goals moves through. If that can't decide a winner the teams go into extra time followed by penalties. This goes on till you have the final (just like the Superbowl is already at a predetermined location). One game if it ends in a tie it goes to extra time then it goes to penalties. The winner is given a spot for next years champions league. Real beat Athletico Madrid to win their 10th champions league final (La Decima) last year. We're not in the champions league this year. 

Europa League 

Same format as the Champions league; Group stages (Which we came on top), Knock out round (We're playing young boys a swiss team sometime next month) determined by aggregate, then most away goals, then extra time, then penalties. The final is held at a predetermined location it goes to extra time then penalties. Winner gets a spot in next years champions league

Sorry about the Great Wall of Text here's your summary

Tl;Dr We're still in Europa league but we've been eliminated from every other cup we were eligible for. We are close to the relegation zone in the Barclays Premier League.

The FA Cup is similar, but a much bigger deal.  The preliminary rounds start in the fall and teams from pretty low down the pyramid (I think the 10th or 11th tier) attempt to qualify, something like 650-700 teams.  At each round, teams from further up the ladder enter, until in the third round the Premier League teams come in.

Whereas many people see someone with work ethic and attitude problems, I see a man who has been obviously deeply distracted and under stress. I also imagine Ade is probably seriously frustrated not with the situation but also with himself, as his physical and personal issues arose during a time of transition within the team that he was basically left out of.  I can't feel that it helps the situation, or makes Ade feel more comfortable or a true part of the team, if we as fans rake him over the coals every chance we get while adulating Kane and being accepting of Soldado's struggles.

null,false,MalcontentUK,null,null,null,"I flirted with moving careers (from medicine, going into a science based masters programme) but didn't in the end. But I was given some general useful bits of advice for when applying for post-grad courses.

First general advice; in addition to what [Eloquai said](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/2tcgjb/masters_degree_admission_criteria/cnxr7z3), in the universities graduate prospectuses they do outline the individual admission criteria for each specific course and programme, and usually specify the minimum class of degree required - so while the website says generally 2:1 or above, some courses will specify ""a good 1st"" - unfortunately they're not kidding when they say that and if it's above the universities minimum then it means it's a particularly competitive/popular course. They will also specify the other requirements - e.g. [In LSE's prospectus](http://lsedesignunit.com/GraduateProspectus2015/) (which you mention above), non-UK graduates usually also need to do GRE or GMAT for most courses and even UK graduates may need to do them for some courses or are recommended to do them for others as it can be very competitive.

As well as the academic requirements (which you either meet/exceed or not), your personal statement is extremely important as its the only opportunity you get to stand out from the crowd to get an interview (or sometimes straight onto a course). When writing a personal statement, do it very early and get someone (or a few people) to read it for you; ideally get someone at your current university who is familiar with admissions (particularly someone in your current course's department or a field related to the masters programme you're after). The general idea of a personal statement is that you demonstrate you're a normal rounded person (surprisingly important aspect!), you show off your relevant achievements (not necessarily just academic) and that you demonstrate why you want to do the course (passion for the subject, a bit of a life plan - things that show you're dedicated to it, motivated and will follow through). It's also important that you pick your academic referees carefully - you really want people as senior as possible, who write well but by far most important is that they *like you and you can trust them to do a good job*. A supportive referee would probably also make an ideal person to help check over your personal statement - the earlier you do it, the better and the more time for corrections and changes, plus more time (perhaps cynically) to butter up your referees. 

That's about all the advice I can remember except to remember it is *not* the same as applying for an undergraduate course: many people seem to wing that process at 17/18 years old and the universities give some latitude for that because they're kids applying from school. It can be very competitive to do a masters (especially with overseas graduates piling in), plus as the funding is different (and big business) the universities want the best students and people who will stick to the course. So you have to take the process as seriously as they do.",null,0,null,1422041175,null,0,false,0,cnyl8ym,null,t3_2tcgjb,null,t1_cnyl8ym,null,t3_2tcgjb,null,null,null,1424433501,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

I think what we love about luis the most, though, is the pure passion he played with every game. crying after crystal palace (last season) and after the zenit game (2 years ago) was gut wrenching to watch. picking stevie up after the chelsea game was inspiring. the way he celebrated with the fans was something i can't explain, and even though i watched all the games on tv, i felt connected with him and his success. he was the honorary vice captain when stevie or dagger weren't on the field and even started a couple games with the armband. that shows you how much brendan entrusted in him, how much the club believed in his passion. someone like him comes around one in a billion, he is truly the most unique footballer of the generation. a bit crazy, but a genius on the pitch. passionate and loyal, yet always having an eye on the greater goal. my only wish with luis is that he could have stayed one more season, but he earned a 75m move to barca and i think we were happy to oblige as much as he was happy to have had the final season that he did.",null,0,null,1422041631,null,0,false,0,cnyljj3,null,t3_2tf3o8,null,t1_cnyljj3,null,t1_cnyiemu,null,null,null,1424433364,null,16,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,16,null

Yeah, new trains are expensive anyway. But the railway companies don't actually buy new trains.

The taxpayer and farepayer ends up paying for the trains many times over, over the 40 year lifespan of the average train.

The equivalent would be if you saw a house you liked, and instead of getting a mortgage yourself, you got someone else to buy it, and just rented it for 40 years for way more than what the mortgage would be.

Down lower in the thread you stated ""You don't see chelsea, city and united winning the league because they have 'youth talent'."" 

Aside from the fact that United's academy played a massive part in arguably the biggest period of sustained success ever witnessed in any team sport, this statement pretty much encapsulates your childlike understanding of every facet of football. Think really hard for a few minutes about what those clubs have that we don't. The words ""resources"" and ""unlimited"" and ""virtually"" might come up...try to rearrange them so they make sense. 

Pochettino is not stupid. If he could go out and buy a player like Bony or Schneiderlin or w/e he surely would. He had no problems spending some money here and there at Southampton. But I think he's quite rightly trying to change our identity and mentality. Rather than bitch constantly about the restraints he has, he's focusing on the positives of our academy. There is literally no downside to improving our academy and giving worthy players opportunities. 

I know you don't agree with Pochettino on which players deserve opportunities, but at the end of the day you are an idiot with a keyboard and he is a man who has lived and breathed this sport his entire life. 

Look at Liverpool for a second. They have a lot of money. A big revenue stream from a worldwide fanbase, a big wage bill, a history of spending a lot in the transfer window. 

They had Champions League football to attract players. They have a history of winning lots of silverware. And yet the best they can do is buy players like Lallana, Lovren, Sakho, Markovic etc. All theoretically fine players which they paid a lot for, but not exactly world beaters just yet. They couldn't attract Sanchez, they won't get someone like Reus. Fuck's sake they couldn't even sign a 16 year old who worships their club. 

Now what on earth do you expect a team like Spurs to be doing in the transfer window? 

As long as we are in the financial spot we're in, the types of signings we've made are the types of signings you should continue to expect. Expect not to spend big unless we also sell big. Expect to buy younger players with a chance of making money from sales later down the line. Expect players like Eriksen, Vertonghen, Lloris--opportunistic bargains--to be rare gems among more mediocre buys. Expect there to be plenty of misses to go with the hits. Learn to celebrate a signing like Chadli which proves to be a successful bit of business because it'll be more common than a Bale or a Modric. 

If you have a problem with any of this, there's still time for you to go support one of the clubs with unlimited money. If the end-all-be-all of you supporting this club is Champions League football, you chose the wrong one.",null,0,null,1422042264,null,0,false,0,cnylxzq,null,t3_2tegqc,null,t1_cnylxzq,null,t1_cnycy88,null,null,null,1424433177,null,10,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,10,null

For the time being, a VPN will easily prevent ""casual"" government snooping, as proposed by this bill. If you're specifically put under surveillance however, you probably haven't got a chance. There are other ways to track a computer after all, as you said.

I don't say that at all and I resent the implication that I do.

Not at all. One thing I think you're overlooking is that Jesus is not some random person or volunteer, Jesus is literally God in human form. It's not just some arbitrary being he decided he'd kill for lols. The reason for the sacrifice, I believe anyway, is to offset Sin. Which again would lead into a long discussion on the nature of Sin.

&gt; **The end of Roman rule in Britain facilitated the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, which historians often regard as the origin of England and of the English people.** The Anglo-Saxons, a collection of various Germanic peoples, established several kingdoms that became the primary powers in present-day England and parts of southern Scotland.
[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_England)

The English Language did not exist during the Roman empire and only developed with various waves of Anglo Saxon invasion after its demise, The tribe from whom the name England is derived. In the process losing the much older [brittonic celtic language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittonic_languages)

&gt; English originated in the dialects of North Sea Germanic that were carried to Britain by Germanic settlers from various parts of what are now the Netherlands, northwest Germany, and Denmark.[38] Up to that point, in Roman Britain the native population is assumed to have spoken Common Brittonic, a Celtic language, alongside the acrolectal influence of Latin, due to the 400-year period of Roman Britain.[39] One of these incoming Germanic tribes was the Angles,[40] whom Bede believed to have relocated entirely to Britain.[41] The names 'England' (from Engla land[42] ""Land of the Angles"") and English (Old English Englisc[43]) are derived from the name of this tribe—but Saxons, Jutes and a range of Germanic peoples from the coasts of Frisia, Lower Saxony, Jutland and Southern Sweden also moved to Britain in this era.[44][45][46]
&gt; 
&gt; Initially, Old English was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of Anglo-Saxon England[47] but the West Saxon dialect eventually came to dominate, and it is in this that the poem Beowulf is written.
&gt; 
&gt; Old English was later transformed by two waves of invasion. The first was by speakers of the North Germanic language branch when Halfdan Ragnarsson and Ivar the Boneless started the conquering and colonisation of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries.

[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language#History)

Ireland however had an established common Language, customs and legal code long before that.

&gt; Written Irish is first attested in Ogham inscriptions from the fourth century AD; this stage of the language is known as Primitive Irish. These writings have been found throughout Ireland and the west coast of Great Britain. Primitive Irish transitioned into Old Irish through the 5th century. Old Irish, dating from the sixth century, used the Latin alphabet and is attested primarily in marginalia to Latin manuscripts. During this time, the Irish language absorbed many Latin words, including ecclesiastical terms: examples are easpag (bishop) from episcopus, and Domhnach (Sunday, from dominica). By the 10th century, Old Irish had evolved into Middle Irish, which was spoken throughout Ireland and in Scotland and the Isle of Man. It is the language of a large corpus of literature, including the Ulster Cycle. From the 12th century Middle Irish began to evolve into modern Irish in Ireland, into Scottish Gaelic in Scotland, and into the Manx language in the Isle of Man. Early Modern Irish, dating from the thirteenth century, was the basis of the literary language of both Ireland and Gaelic-speaking Scotland.

Copying this from another post. 

So, think this was you. You've been told by doctors there is a mother who is disconnecting her child from potentially life saving equipment, to take her home. If she is disconnected from those machines, IT COULD KILL HER. 

You have no other context than the woman was agressively trying to leave with her sick daughter. When asked to stop removing equipment or trying to move the child, the woman holds on to her child, which risks pulling the child from the bed. Removing the equipment which might save her life. 

Injuring someone to potentially save someone's life, even if it looks horrendous, seems like a reasonable thing to do. Perhaps the officer went too far, but the sentiment of his actions were in the right place. 

What annoys me is the way the article phrases the entire thing, as if the mother did nothing wrong. She was trying to remove hospital equipment and forceably remove her child from a hospital.

* *Portability* - I have to be able to decant it into a travel size container, or there should be samples of it so I can take it around. If there isn't, then sorry buh bye product.

* *Reviews* - I have to find a well written negative review. If a product just has glowing reviews that worries me a little. I have to know if someone didn't like it, and what they didn't like about it. If they have my skin type and how they're managing it if they still use it.

* *Samples* - I also am not buying a full size of anything (other than a cleanser) I haven't tried a sample of.

Even Kirsty Williams, who I usually find to be insufferable.

Unless her performance is disastrously bad, though, I don't think this could possibly hurt Plaid. The party's biggest problem is exposure: it doesn't get any. These debates, if they actually go ahead as planned, will provide Plaid with the chance to remedy that, and 
thereby grab the attention of the Welsh electorate. It hasn't had such a chance since the '99 Assembly Election, when it won a higher vote share than the SNP did in Scotland, with almost 30% of all votes cast.

In fact, even leading anti-extremist groups generally argue that returning fghters - except for high risk individuals - shouldn't be charged, but instead forced to take part in mandatory de-radicalisation programs. Others enter de-radicalisaiton programs even without intervention of the state, and it would be counter productive in many cases to just drag people away and put them in court and ship them off to a jail.

There were around 20 of us on that course and not one of us needed to learn how to use emails. They're just dished out as punishments and in turn these courses are receiving up to £500 per person that attends out of the taxes put aside that are supposed to help people back into work. 

Everybody from the jobcentre, to the work program to those that are running the courses and those attending know fine well that that money is just being passed around with no intention to help anybody back into work. It's just various training companies popping up everywhere looking to get their share of the coffers whilst so much of it is being dished out.

I even got sent to a housing advice centre for voluntary work at one point. Turned up and there was 6 of us on voluntary positions stuck in this tiny front office that could hold at most 3 people comfortably.. And then you had the 3 actual employees who worked there.

On the second day we all just got sent home after signing papers saying we'd been there for 2 weeks. The bloke admitted he just takes people on for extra funding and we weren't going to complain about not having to sit sweating our balls off watching 3 people sit and chat at their desks all day, so we all just signed the paperwork.

null,false,joaommx,dundeeutd,,null,"Not exactly, there are no variables but United will get a share of a future sale. The deal details have been made public by Sporting. They were published in Sporting's newspaper back in September:

* Sporting paid United £2.200.000 for 80% of Gauld's economic rights

* Until 31 July 2015 Sporting can buy an extra 10% for £500.000

* Until 31 July 2016 Sporting can buy another additional 10% for £500.000

If Sporting buys the remaining shares from United and ends up owning 100% of his economic rights United will still receive some money from a future sale. The way that compensation is calculated is like this:

* United's compensation = (Sale price - €5.000.000)*15%

So for example if Sporting sells Gauld for €20.000.000, United will receive a compensation of (€20.000.000 - €5.000.000)*15% = €2.250.000",null,0,null,1422049175,null,0,false,0,cnyqb43,null,t3_2t7x9j,null,t1_cnyqb43,null,t1_cnxb2e4,null,null,null,1424431069,null,1,false,ScottishFootball,t5_2sba4,1,null

null,false,MadArend,num20,,null,"The ""highest win percentage"" stat that Sherwood likes to throw around relates to his record in the Premier League.

Interestingly, Pochettino today has managed exactly as many matches in the Premier League as Sherwood did, 22.

Best record in his first 22 matches, past three managers:

Manager | GP | W | D | L | W% 
 --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
 Sherwood | 22 | 13 | 3 | 6 | 59.1% 
 Villas-Boas | 22 | 12 | 4 | 6 | 54.5%
 Pochettino | 22 | 11 | 4 | 7 | 50.0%| 

Of course, one big difference is that Sherwood really had only one competition to deal with most of his time, as he immediately crashed out of the FA Cup and League Cup, and went out of the Europa League not long after.  AVB crashed out of the League Cup after two games, but kept us going in the FA Cup ad the Europa League.  Pochettino has kept us going strong in all three.

For sure, restricting the set to Premier League matches exclusively can be a form of cherry-picking, and I think Sherwood was doing exactly that when he claimed to have the best league win percentage in Spurs history, while conveniently leaving out his utterly atrocious record in other competitions.

That said, separating out the Premier League records provides a more valid basis of comparison, since Premier League opposition is roughly equivalent across years and across managers, whereas opposition in the cups and the Europa League varies.  It's still not great, since lots of other things vary across years, unrelated to the competition: things like squad strength, player form, etc.  And sample sizes are still pretty small, so luck plays a significant part.  But focusing on the PL does at least add at least one ""control.""

This is at about the top of my price range, I could get the older model 2005-2011 with fewer miles but I really prefer the newer model.

She doesn't get the hand holding like you've mentioned, I try to guide her, and none of that matters when you have a crying kid due to no one coming to the party. I can't tell her ""well, you're not very nice to people"" that one day when she's sad about it, I try to guide her daily but mostly she's an individual who makes her own choices. 

With special needs kids, I can't speak to that. We had a couple kids with ADD but that was it. My daughter mentions that she goes to Art with a group of autistic students. She doesn't ""like"" it because the teacher only caters to the autistic children, but she understands that they need more attention. They are seated on the other side of the classroom, they do not do the same projects and because Art is an elective, they are integrated to help with socialization, but are not allowed to socialize. 

But if I saw any one of them sad because they were left out for some reason, they would get blanket sympathy. As well as the gifted and average kids. 

I do appreciate your point, but this post wasn't about the social interactions, just more about the community showing love for a fellow fan.

At the end of the training course I did two scenarios which were quite realistic and involved distraction techniques, baton strikes, cs spray and handcuffing.
