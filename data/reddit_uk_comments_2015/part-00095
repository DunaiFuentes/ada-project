There are basically no original stories. Haven't been in centuries; 99% of books follow one of a very limited number of plot themes, and Pratchett's work was no exception. 

The reason we read and love authors like Pratchett isn't because of his wholly original ideas, it's because of the clever way he would explore themes, weaving references and jokes in. His books are easy enough for a teen to read yet intricate enough that you can still find jokes you didn't notice ten, twenty years later.

Take Jingo, for instance. On the face of it, it's a fun little story. But when you understand what Jingoism is, you realise the book parodies such things as racism and diplomatic relations while throwing in a not-terribly-subtle reference to the Lost City of Atlantis.  Or clacks towers which are obviously a cross between belisha beacons and the telegraph.

He also provides no evidence whatsoever to suggest that these psychological observations have any basis in reality. I think this line sums up his views nicely:

&gt;""If our society had no social problems at all, the leftists would have to INVENT problems in order to provide themselves with an excuse for making a fuss.""

Which is perhaps true. I would argue that the right could be similarly defined:

&gt;Our society has terrible social problems, but the rightists have to PRETEND THEY DON'T EXIST in order to maintain their power, and the status quo.",null,0,null,1426196810,null,0,false,0,cpd054q,null,t3_2yry8q,null,t1_cpd054q,null,t1_cpcnt8p,null,null,null,1427727235,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

My concern is the United, Arsenal and Liverpool fixtures. I just hope we play like a team that's not afraid of the opposition instead the shit we've been doing so far. I have no problem with playing defensively, I just don't like us trying to settle on a 1 goal lead or a draw unless it's the last few minutes. I also wish we commit on the counter. I don't know what happened but this year we even counter like we did last year. You'll see the striker and attacking mids commit, but the holding mids and back line don't really help out outside of Ivanovic.

Agree.

&gt;  I don't really think Fabregas playing deep is the big issue. 

It isn't THE big issue, but it is A big issue. Take a look at some of our best games bar the stoke game. His best results and performances have always come when he plays next to Matic. He sees more of the ball, he gets more involved and he plays better coming from deep. Furthermore he doesn't have the pressing ability that oscar has, to close down spaces and force errors. He gets isolated, surrounded, taken out of the game and goes invisible when he plays up front.

null,false,major_pants,null,null,null,"For non-tax exempt wrappers you need to maximise your use of capital gains tax allowance each year (c£10k I believe) - i.e. liquidate a holding in a fund when gains reach that level, reinvest in a similar fund. You will end up paying tax, but as you say - you have ticked the obvious boxes.

Property may be good, its all about diversification at the asset allocation level - stock, bond, cash, property, gold, other real assets. Politically BTL appears a target for labour but no forecasting possible on tax treatments and who can ever predict what's going on with London property prices.

With the pension there is an annual limit to what you can put in and receive tax relief (40k currently). Although may be worth using your carry forward capability to max out the tax relief - you can go back to 2011/12 and fill any gaps in your take up of the 50k allowance in that year, 2012/13 and 2013/14.

However given how young you are you should model out the likely value of your pension at 55 when (at least currently) you can first access it. There is a £1.25m life time allowance limit on the pension, go over that and face 55% tax on the excess (clawing back the relief you got at the time of contribution). This seems to be an area politicians fiddle with regularly.

You may want to look at VCTs as a tax efficient investment. Tax relief at time of investment on income tax (I think 30%) and dividends are tax free and no capital gains. A number of managers have consistently hit 5% yields (tax free) over recent years, but previous performance is no indication etc. etc. - Mobeus, NVM, Baronsmead are all well regarded, but there are others. This is high risk investment in small companies - much higher risk than stock market trackers etc. IMO EIS and SEIS schemes are too high risk for the most part - better to pay tax...

Well done for getting your pension in good condition early in your working life. And don't let all your decisions be driven by tax.

null,false,Dardanator,null,null,null,"I wouldn't. I'm not a fan of the current set up, the law is somewhat confusing and ridiculous in parts and I think TVL are  rather forceful and threatening in their collection of licence fees. A compulsory licence would fix that in some respects but I still don't see the point in a licence fee, particularly that it is used to fund the bbc but is required to watch any TV channel, even if they're broadcast from outside the United Kingdom. I'd rather see it abolished and have the tv service just receive direct funding from the government. That would still mean money we pay in taxes is used to fund it, but it removes the problems caused by outdated and needlessly restrictive legislation that has struggled to keep up with modern developments. If, in the meantime, the BBC want to set up their own subscription service for accessing iPlayer (and waive the fee for licence holders) then they're free to do that.

A more timely question is do I think non-payment should be decriminalised? I'm in two minds about that. On the one hand, sending people to prison for not paying a tv licence fee is utterly ridiculous. On the other hand, if decriminalised then non-payment will become a civil offence, and civil court cases don't seem to require the strict ""innocent until proven guilty"" approach that criminal cases do. That is, currently the prosecution would need solid evidence that you were watching TV while not covered by a licence, something very difficult to obtain unless you're a complete moron. If decriminalised they might not need such compelling evidence and it would be easier for innocent people to be find.

The difference with Franky Boyle, for example, is that Franky Boyle's persona is to be as offensive as possible. I find him over the top, and a conceited shit of a comedian, even if he does rip laughs out of me, quite often. Clarkson's public persona is to pretend to be himself, pretending to be himself. So he is offensive in that he pretends not to want to be offensive whilst clearly wanting to be offensive. Part of it is apparently improvised, or at least personalised to his off/screen on-screen persona, where he comes up with jokes from the seventies and early eighties, employs musical stigma from the same periods, and is seen to be ""being himself"" in his on-screen performance, a reflection of his off-screen situation of age and culture, on-screen, off-screen... on the screen, in an off screen way ... etc. I exaggerate, but I wish to convey the idea that he conveys a persona that is fake real and yet real fake, and real, and fake ... and so when he comes out with a perler, the public can't know what is real, fake, old-ass sad, and pure contrived comedy, and so his fake real genuineness is perceived as being too honest for comedy, too funny for honesty. But the *cultural age* of his humour does not advance so well, and that is where we feel we *can* and possibly should get tired of him. He is a real fake scripted genuine asshole and he cannot keep his game up to follow society. His time may be over. People might ask for more of his shtick for a bit, but he has to lose his traction soon because the real fake genuine part is stronger than him and he is more and more apparently an anachronism ... and coming over as a two-faced piece of shit will be the only thing left before he slips way from the TV eye and sticks with the written press where he will get more angry and represent the funeral insurance general public. His failing there will be that his public likes Meatloaf, so he will have to sup it up or drift into actual obscurity and live with his money and ten-year old car collection.

It might be worth having your partner follow you, or someone else in a car if need be. It will make you feel a bit more secure, which might help in another dodgy scenario. It sounds like you know what you're doing but probably panicked and lost control, it happens. Your goal should be to get as comfortable as possible so that when something bad happens in the future, you react the way you're meant to.

Traffic is the worst part about using the roads, try to get out of town or ride at weird times. Before 9am on the weekends is a good time to be out. Practice your braking, they're not much cop on the YBR and the wheels lock fairly easily, which might have been what happened before. Squeeze don't grab.

Stay disorganize? We were rubbish, no tactics or formation could have saved us from getting knocked out. Our players didn't play with heart. Honestly, what kind of formation or tactics would have made our players more energetic and defend set pieces? They were indecisive and running scared the whole time. All our players were utterly rubbish, even the keeper included. His long balls were erratic and was gifting PSG an easy ball possession. Jose's teams are not known for being just defensive. They are discipline and energetic. They do chase the ball for 90 minutes. If we were ultra defensive or parked the bus there is no way in hell we would have conceded two goals from corners. We would have been discipline, organized and very strong at the back. PSG looked very dangerous every time they had the ball. It is quite shocking that most fans here are not blaming the players for their outrageous performance. You can't always manage determination and will to win. Against PSG our players lacked those traits that made Chelsea unbreakable in big matches.

My experience is that London salaries are above regional salaries, and career prospects tend to be far better. I appreciate this will rile all non-Londoners and is not always the case.

If you do decide to stay in London I'd advise thinking about schools early and get yourself near some decent ones with your first property. Bad London schools are really bad.

Aside from that I though Jags had a great game. Made one (maybe two?) big blocks in the box, and definitely commanded like a captain should.

Alcaraz had an awful first half. Three or four shit passes off the top of my head, and two potentially huge mistakes in the box. Looked better in the second half though. Regardless, we should have Stones back in the next leg, so it shouldn't be a problem.

Barkley playing hungry. Not back at his best, but the effort is there. Hopefully he keeps it up, and gets a goal to bring his confidence back up.

As for Martinez, I thought subs today were on point. Whatever he said during the break motivated the team to push hard for the rest of the match, and his subs later on were both good decisions. Both Kone and Osman made strong impacts in the attacking intensity.

Yeah, *RAIL* recently looked at the Neville Hill depot, they are having to refurbish many of the ancillary bits on the HSTs and are now seeking companies to remanufacture things like speed governors and alternators, IIRC.

As good as the HST has been, now is really not the time to be trying to retro fit yet more equipment like ERTMS or whatever to them.

&gt; And it makes it easier from a management perspective, if you can use one train across your entire network. I know that Network Rail was told to ensure that there is enough line clearance so that the IEP can run down here if necessary.

I hadn't heard that one but it would make sense.

&gt; I don't think anything to do with the ""Insanely Expensive Project"" would be anything less than horrendously expensive :)

Nope. Hitachi must be laughing all the way to the bank, all they have to do is literally build the train to spec. That said if it is anything like the Javelin it will be very reliable, so they are a very good choice for something that must last for the next ~30 years. It's a pity there isn't a truly British manufacturer left who could have built a 'HST2' but that went out of the window 20 years ago when BREL was sold off.

&gt; To be honest, of all the investments in rail that ignore Devon and Cornwall, this one annoys me the least. I really like HSTs. I just don't like the fact that the line they run on is so crap and slow.

Yeah, I think we have discussed the Dawlish situation before. Yes, it's a wonderfully scenic and historic part of the railway network but the time has now come to leave it as a secondary line for local services and build a new line inland between Exeter and Plymouth.

1 minute in and it's already hilarious how they had a video of Ed singing but with a womans voice over it.. 

2:16 - Huh, he can do a rubix cube in a minute and a half. Oddly this is the most respect I've ever felt towards him..

3:30 - Why doesn't he have a podium? Looks so awkward sitting there in the middle of the stage..

6:13 - First bit of panto audience reaction from the guy that said the working class don't give a damn about feminism. 

6:20 - A bloke just said 'Woman to woman' as if him and Ed are both women.. Not sure if this guy is a troll or what. 

8:10 - Really liked Eds answer to the 'why go after the young peoples vote if we don't vote anyway' answer. He admitted he wants young people to vote for him so he can get into power, but he also admitted that his generation had it way way easier than the current generation do and he wants to fix it. Didn't really say how he'd fix it though, but admitting there's a problem is good. 

12:09 - From Twitter 'How do we know you'll not break your promises like others have before'.. A small dig at Clegg, and he's making the claim that he sticks to his promises. I have no idea how true that is though. Said he wants to 'Under promise and over deliver' which is a nice little soundbite I'm sure we'll see in the papers tomorrow. 

14:00 - Private rentals is brought up. Ed says people are being ripped off and that he wants to implement 3 year minimum contracts. Also that letting agents won't be allowed to charge fees for tenants. Fucking fantastic proposals, imo. He even had a dig at the last Labour government. 

15:00 - 'Call me Ed' 'No, I'll call you Mr Milliband'.. Legend. But then he goes on to complain about Gordon Brown and doesn't even mention Tony Blair... And he didn't really have a useful question. 

18:30 - Will abolish the bedroom tax. Huge applause. Wish he wouldn't call it a tax though.. It's clearly not a tax, it's a benefit cut. I wouldn't usually mind, but he specifically said 'Of all the taxes, the bedroom tax is one of the worst..' 

19:25 - 'You're weird and you look like Wallace, do you think that matters?' I'm not even joking. That was an actual question. No was the answer, and he even made a joke.. Got to admit, I'm warming to him a bit. 

20:35 - Someone rips into his appearance again and says he'll look ridiculous as our leader. Harsh. 

22:10 - 'You've never run a business, how can you run a country.' His answer was that he's not embarrassed of being in politics and that his parents taught him that if you see injustice then you should do something about it, and that's what he's doing. 

22:45 - 'Stop shouting on PMQ's, don't you know how microphones work?'.. His answer is that PMQ's is awful. But he says he doesn't know how to change it. But he also said he'll create a 'Peoples PMQs'..

25:30 - Says he's trying to get away from New Labour in response to a question about his brother. Doesn't recognise what he did as backstabbing. 

27:20 - 'I'm from Rotherham. Why should we still vote Labour?' (got a cheer) 'And not UKIP' (Got mad boos).. Ed admits that the Labour party has let Rotherham down. Guy from 15:00 is shouting again. Think he insinuated that the Labour council abused children, but could be language barrier. Guy next to him is trying to calm him down, lol. Ed says learn the lesson.. Yadda yadda. Not that convinced. 

28:38 - Ed says people calling him a weak leader are wrong. 

29:50 - 'Whats your biggest fear about being PM' Answer is family. Yawn. Lets be honest, his biggest fear is that he'll fuck up royally and be hated for generations because of it. That'd be anyones biggest fear as PM. 

I'm done now. But Eds won me over a bit. The Conservatives and Lib Dems are the only two viable parties in my area though, so I still won't be voting Labour but if I was on the fence I might be tempted from what I heard in the first half and hour. 

Most reassuring bit was how he said he wants to distance himself from the Labour of Tony Blair.

I had a bit of help as I managed to get a lot of gear by nicking my Dad's old stuff and then gradually replaced it. 

Day to day running costs are a lot less than a car. You'll be doing over 100mpg, tyres for a CBF are around £40 each and all it will need is a bit of chain lube at the weekends, cleaning and an oil change every 6 months or so. 

It's the gear that adds up and makes it expensive. Yes, you can go budget but if you ride everyday, I'd say buying the best is worth it. Proper goretex for winter, a decent helmet and a nice leather jacket. 

I don't want to add it up, but I've been riding 4 years, 125 for 3 and a 650 for 1. I'd guess I've spent close £2000 on gear.

There's actually a couple of newer ones missing, but by the time you get to those, you won't need a reading order.

And here are my own recommendations:

If you want a gentle parody of fantasy, start with The Colour of Magic and immediately carry on to The Light Fantastic. The Rincewind series that it kicks off follows an inept wizzard as he goes about not dying.

If you want a level-headed yet reverent look at myths, magic and stories, start with either Equal Rites or Wyrd Sisters. Equal Rites is a bit odd compared to the rest of the Witches series as it involves the first female wizard. (Yes, it's explained in the book.) Wyrd Sisters is more about the power of Shakespeare leaking into the Discworld. I'll say no more, there.

If you like mystery and what turns out to be CSI: Ankh-Morpork, go for Guards! Guards!. The Watch series of books follow Sam Vimes, commander of the Ankh-Morpork Night Watch as he looks at attempting to police a world full of magic and mystery. This series contains many humorous and thought-provoking quips and quotes.

If you want to see modern-day life inexplicably mirrored in a pre-industrial age with humorous outcomes, go for the Industrial Revolution series. Many of these books are parodies of our own culture.

Finally, the Death series. These don't really parody anything (as far as I'm aware) and I consider them the more original of Terry's Discworld works. They weave an interesting story/view of life and death. I started on Mort, not knowing entirely what to expect. I haven't read it for possibly a decade, yet I still clearly remember the moment Mort met Death for the first time. It is perhaps this set of books that are the most relevant at the moment, given that Terry's buggered off into the great unknown.

The reading order isn't strict. You can pick and choose most of the novels, as recurring characters and settings will be properly introduced in each book. The important thing is to find something that piques your interest, as that will help you to branch out into things you may not have enjoyed before getting to know Terry's style.

I hope this helps.",null,0,null,1426206316,null,0,false,0,cpd5nr1,null,t3_2ysu63,null,t1_cpd5nr1,null,t1_cpcpo4t,null,null,null,1427729831,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

**1. Is university for you, or is it time to get out of education?** It's a big investment of money and time. There's no point doing a course you don't care about for a job you don't want when you could be out earning. 

**2. What subjects interest you?** From what it sounds like, marketing or creative writing may be interesting to you.

**3. How is your subject going to benefit your career?** Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying do something you hate for the vague promise of a job afterwards, but I am saying be realistic and have a plan in mind. If you decide you want to be a web designer, say, plan out getting experience accordingly.

Like most things, uni is a balance between finding something you enjoy and something that will benefit future-you. Don't let yourself be guilted into something you'll hate because you don't want to be in a career you hate for the next few decades, but don't pick something which has no relevance to whatever career you want because you thought it'd be a fun 3 years and ~40 grand.

It is simply a fact that the EU formed from these groups and communities. You cannot rebut that. the EU didn't just begin one day. We didn't just wake up one morning to closer economic, political etc union. This happened over the course of decades, and the name of the union and legal methods changed accordingly.

Since you are  not subject to income tax right now, the benefits aren't really there but the drawback of not being able to touch it until you are 55 is in place. 

For now it's probably best to just save normally and put it in an ISA to build up your allowance. Whilst you might not see the tax benefits of an ISA right now, it'll become important later once you start paying income tax so if you've already built some up then that will be useful as there is a limit on contributions per year.  Now you can contribute upto 15k per year so it's a lot more generous anyway (used to be much less) but there is no disadvantage to you putting your savings in an ISA unless you can't get the same rates you can get in non ISA accounts. 

If you can get a Santander 123 account that pays 3% it might be worth going with that over an ISA though.

It would be very easy to quit and then get stuck in a rut doing nothing so it is vital that you have some idea of what you'd do instead.

There are lots of options (year out to travel or work, switch University course etc), but one starting place might be to try and get a week or two of work experience in an Advertising agency - see if the reality of the Ad Creative is something you might enjoy and you might even get some advice from them about the best route in to that area. At least that would be a starting point on one area that you have some mild interest in.

The other thing I'd start doing is researching careers and jobs - you're at a University so why not make use of all the facilities available? You may have had loads of people telling you about this at college/6th form but lets face it - who really does it? Well now is the time if you're finding yourself stuck on a path you don't like. Go to the University's Careers Advice service, go to the Library and start looking at careers books and websites. Maybe start with creative industries (Design, Media, Architecture, Computing, Advertising, etc - it's a broad category) but don't be afraid to look at whole new areas you probably never considered before and see if anything sparks an interest. If you don't know what's out there then how can you know what you want to do? 

That's where I'd start. Careers Advice might also be able to help in arranging a work experience placement, but if not I'd start writing to agencies and asking - nothing to lose from trying.

If i was in your position, I would work on gathering as many options as i could. The first thing to do is talk to someone about careers and the entryway into marketing (ie whether you need a degree and what degree exactly) and also what aspect of marketing (it seems like it has a lot to it: advertising, PR, event management, research), you'll then have to decide if you want to get out of education or consider going to uni for a marketing-related degree.

Then you have to figure out a plan, i'd highly recommend finishing out your first year. ""Quit/failed First year law"" is going to look substantially worse on your CV than leaving after successfully finishing first year, i know it's hard and you have no interest in it, but you have to stick it out until the end of the year. The plan for after that should be something along these lines:

1. Contact some of the big (big!, think Tesco or M&amp;S) companies that are based in your city, they'll have a careers section on their website somewhere that you can contact. Try to talk them into letting you shadow their marketing team for a couple of days to see what they actually do. There are advertising agencies that you should contact as well for the same thing.

2. Apply for courses through UCAS. Go for advertising, business admin or marketing. You may or may not go on to do the course, it doesn't matter, just get an offer so you have the option.

3. Depending on how well step one goes, apply for some jobs, apprenticeships or internships with marketing or advertising agencies. Now i think about it, they could probably tell you in 30 seconds exactly how to get into the industry and whether or not you need a degree.

4. Tell your parents. Good luck with that.

We pretty much played on the left side,so much so that there is a thread about Costa playing too wide, because Ramires is so ineffective going forward.

Pretty much when you started saying, 

      ""But the European Steel and Coal Community was
       the proto-EU. It went through many stages to get 
       to where it is today. Sort of similar to how a nation 
       forms and reforms.""

When you start arguing for what the EU is, or pushing towards, on the merits of something different and unrelated, that's when you started arguing it as justified, without knowing your history.

&gt;but you're losing focus.

Seriously, that's the last thing you should be saying to me now given you have missed that it wasn't the EU, even-formed, which you want to give credit for.

&gt;My argument is that the EU and all stages before the EU have maintained peace in Europe. 

Then you've changed the argument and it doesn't apply to the EU today.

If you wanted to argue that the EU has brought peace - and that's a terrible platfor given the crisis and what it is doing now, then it has nothing to do with pre-EU.

You can't justify the EU for what it is, according to what something before it was and which it has changed from.

&gt; You are making far too many presumptions about what my actual opinion is of the EU.

I'm not making any.  You literally just said so in the same paragraph.  "" My argument is that the EU and all stages before the EU have maintained peace in Europe.""   The EU hasn't, and all the stages before weren't the EU, and needn't have become the EU.

You're wanting to inherit kudos which has nothing to do with the EU, and use it as a pro-EU argument.  No.  You can't.  The EU before it was formed has nothing to do with the peace it maintained before it.

&gt;Your first issue is that you aren't convinced that the EU is a reformed coal and steel community.

I'm not arguing it hasn't evolved from it. Everybody knows it did.  That doesn't mean that it is the same thing.

Please don't state obvious things and then assert them.  You don't have to give a link to what it evolved out of.  We're not children, and it doesn't make your case.

&gt;It is simply a fact that the EU formed from these groups and communities.

It's simply a fact that something that happened in 1993 formed the groups and communities before it?   

Revionism^3

&gt;If it makes it easier for you to conceptualize, let's stop using the term EU and start using the term european economic centralization.

NO.  LET'S NOT.  BECAUSE THEY'RE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS.

That just goes to show you don't know the difference between the EEC, Lisbon, and the future fundamental law being proposed.  It's literally asking me to accept that you have not only adopted the slim side of the wedge, but that the entire wedge has already been accepted as fact without all the treaty changes inbetween

&gt;The crux of what I'm saying is that European economic centralization has been successful in stopping wars in Europe.

Yeah.  And that is utter crap.     
It's as about relevant as it has been in stopping wars with the US and ANZAC.

&gt;If you want to nitpick how incorrect the terms are I'm using to explain, fine. But this conversation will go nowhere

This isn't even close to nitpicking.  This is fundamentals.   

YOU'RE IGNORING AN ENTIRE COLD WAR &amp; THAT THE EU WAS ONLY FORMED IN 1993.

I kind of agree with you here but sitting here saying X player should be sold. This player should be benched, this player should start and this player should be SOLD off **one** (emphasis on one) of the worst team games of our season is so unfair . If we go off that logic, literally the entire team should be benched and sold bar Courtois and Hazard. 

We can't sit here and point fingers when everyone played poorly. We didn't do it vs Tottenham game, we shouldn't do it now.

What we should discuss, imo, is ways we can tighten up our tactics as a team.

Something like (just for an example): 

&gt;Q) What went wrong vs PSG and what can we do to fix this?


&gt; A) Well, I noticed PSG did XYZ. To counter that I think that we need to stop playing X in this position and maybe shift him to this position. Maybe reverting to a more aggressive form of counter attacking and a high line defense.

If you cant criticize players after a poor performance why view a Chelsea forum? There is nothing special with this sub, all online Chelsea communities are like this right now. It was an extremely poor performance and is being treated as such. If all you want to do is cheer there are plenty other places to go mate.

null,false,prototype45,null,null,null,"I think its a bit unfair to judge how we would do against Real/Bayern/Barca based on this bad performance. Yes the tactics weren't the best but the players themselves did not show up. They lacked spirit, determination and discipline. Matic was huffing and puffing by the 30th minute because I'm guessing he didn't train much due to his injury, Costa was beyond dreadful both in terms of attitude and his general game, Fabregas was played out of position and wasn't at his best, Hazard went invisible in the second half, etc.. Where was the team that is so often praised for working hard off the ball? The team that presses and presses, closes spaces and forces errors? We've been praised for that countless times by people like gary neville for that and it was completely absent on wednesday. We looked flat, players were walking, standing on their heels and gary reminded us of it every 5 minutes. On our day, we can definitely beat those teams. Madrid not only lost but conceded **4** goals at home to a schalke whom we beat 5-0 in germany, Bayern also got destroyed by wolfsburg at the alianz and even against Barca we have at least a massive advantage in the air. 

Am I saying we would be favourites to beat those teams? No way. But our chances of defeating them are by no means a small one. This is a quality side that is *very* strong. Wednesday was a mixture of the wrong mindset, the wrong game plan and just the players being far from their best in general. Even against PSG we didn't even lose.. we were knocked out on away goals. It was just a disappointing performance and unfortunately it came at the worst time. 

&gt; We've lost some prestige in Europe 

yeah thats for sure, even though I know that we are still a top 5 team, non chelsea fans will (understandably) say otherwise now. 

&gt; It's not just a loss to move on from as if nothing important has happened.

certainly not, thats why theres been countless threads on here with people asking what the hell happened. A real train wreck game.

It is, but what we played that night was nothing close to defensive football. We can't play defensive if the opponent is sitting back. 

Anyway I agree with your points and the quote in the title is pretty interesting too. I believe that an attack consisting of players such as Costa, Fabregas and Hazard alone should be something every team should fear and we should use that. 

Willian, Hazard and Oscar are amazing shooters from outside of the box, yet we rarely see them shoot. Fabregas is a pretty good dribbler, yet the only players taking on opponents properly in our team are Hazard and Costa (Willian and Ramires do try...) and maybe Ivanović haha. 

It seems to me that when we get to that final third we are too static. There are some runs here and there, but not enough to break the defense, especially with the players that we have.

Losing Gerrard will be a massive blow to the experience in the squad and i think we DO need to find a player or even 2 to help the younger players.

I know he is leaving for PSG, but i would of loved to get Dani Alves in the summer. Would be very reassuring for the younger players.
Xabi Alonso would also be an option and i would love to have him back, but i don't see it happening.

I don't know which player we should get, but we NEED more experience asap. And we can't let Kolo Toure leave.

Chinese university will be pushing to rule the school as according to the law according to policies set by Central Government, as well as increase supervision among schools.

In recent work report of the Li Keqiang, China will be ruling the country with law. Guizhou University's principal Zheng also suggested that schools in China also need to be ruled with law by bodies such as student councils that can sack and criticize teachers who don't perform their duties properly.

Zheng adds, top universities are lacking China's ""rule with law"" mechanism, and their education models shall not be imported into China's higher education reform.

He also adds, after years of reform, China's university students's standard are on the rise, a lot of university ranking polls are unable to reflect this situation. He also points out that without Chinese students overseas, 20% of the United Kingdom's university will face closure.

* Charity.  See if your work offers a Give-As-You-Earn scheme.  With mine, I pay £1 to a charity, it only costs me 60p, and my employer matches my contribution.  So the charity gets £2 for my 60p. See http://www.payrollgiving.co.uk/ and https://www.gov.uk/donating-to-charity/donating-straight-from-your-wages-or-pension 
* Premium Bonds! Lots of people here hate them - I love 'em :-)  Worst case scenario inflation eats away at your savings. Best case scenario, you get a million quid tax free.  Average scenario, you get a few £50 cheques to fritter away.
* Over pay on your mortgage.  Get it down to zero (or close to it).
* Buy-To-Let is reasonably tax efficient.  Once your flat is paid off, you could get a BTL mortgage on it and use that as a deposit for a nicer place.
* Invest in something you love. Rare books, antique fireplaces, Japanese  statues.  Find something you'll enjoy learning about which might have the side-line of being a serious investment.  Which leads me on to...
* Go on holiday, learn to fly a plane, train for a marathon - invest in *yourself*!  No point being the richest man in the graveyard.  Do things which make you happy and let you tell entertaining stories.

null,false,quinn_drummer,null,null,null,"I wouldn't necessarily call these comments racist, but I definitely question his motive for saying them and for him fundamentally misunderstanding or misrepresenting how firms employ people.

I don't think any firm truly worries about hiring a Brit over a non-Brit because there are countless legitimate reasons you can for doing so.  I also suspect it's incredible difficult to prove.  Also, the way he paints this picture, is as if you have a Brit, and a non-Brit apply for a job, and companies feel compelled to hire the non-Brit on grounds of not discriminating. If that were the only case then the Brit could also claim they discrimination based on nationality.  It's not all one sided like that, and I think a lot of people forget that.

Also, firms will where ever possible hire the the best person for the job. If that person happens to be a non-Brit then so be it.  No company is going to pass over someone better qualified for a job because they want a British employee, unless they themselves have prejudiced view and this is exactly why these sorts of anti-discrimination laws are in place.

Now, as I said at the start, I don't think the comments themselves are necessarily racist, but the motives I think are. He is definitely trying to undermine anyone who isn't British, he isn't squeaky clean when it comes to racist comments in the past anyway, and he is using a spin of patriotism to rid laws that protect people from all backgrounds of discrimination, and his reasons given as I have pointed out about are questionable given that I think it isn't a necessarily problem.  If a British worker is passed over for a job in favour of a non-Brit, that's because the non-Brit is better qualified for the role, not because a company feels compelled to hire foreign staff.

David Cameron puts down his glasses as the train pulls out of Watford Junction and confronts the paradox of his five years as prime minister: how is it that a country that has regained its economic poise appears more insular, unsure of its own identity and its place in the world?


It is not a characterisation Mr Cameron recognises. “More solvent, but I don’t think more insular” is how he describes Britain’s evolution since the last election in 2010, held in the shadow of the financial crash. “I think we’ve had to sort out our own stuff but we’ve done it while being, I think, the engaged nation.”
TV debates: Prime minister risks being an ‘empty chair’
British Prime Minister, David Cameron, talks to the FT from a train as he made his way to Birmingham to visit a science exhibition called the ""Big Bang"" at the NEC.


The prime minister’s refusal to take part in a televised head-to-head election debate with Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, has left him open to accusations of cowardice or arrogance.


Since he entered Downing Street at the head of a Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition government, Britain’s economy has been a rare European success story: the deficit as a share of GDP has halved, growth hit 2.6 per cent last year and unemployment has fallen below 6 per cent — half the eurozone average. Yet to the outside world Britain looks more like the Disunited Kingdom. Mr Cameron has been forced to offer a referendum on a British exit from the EU; MPs rejected his plan to intervene in Syria; Washington warns that Britain risks becoming a diminished military force; a restive population frets about immigration; Scottish separatism refuses to go away.
But there is a breezy optimism about David Cameron. There may be a few more grey hairs, he is watching his weight and the spectacles are a more frequent sight but his face remains preternaturally unlined by his five years of office. He says he has been frustrated by the “buggeration factor” of trying to force policy through the system, with its consultations and reviews, but he declines to echo Tony Blair’s phrase about “scars on my back”. That is, he says, “a bit Fifty Shades of Grey”.


Mr Cameron faces a general election on May 7 and the polls are tight. His campaign advisers insist that undecided voters will break in his favour but if they are wrong Labour’s leader Ed Miliband will replace him in Number 10. In any event, the election could produce a messy hung parliament and considerable political risk for business.

Speaking to the Financial Times en route to Birmingham, where he is campaigning, the 48-year-old prime minister admits that his repair job for Britain is not complete. He dismisses criticism that Great Britain has turned into “little England” and says another five years in power would confirm the nation’s status in the world. “The first thing is finish the job,” he says. “With a 5 per cent budget deficit and still too many people unemployed, with growth that hasn’t worked its way through so everyone feels the benefits, the job isn’t done.
“The ambition is for Britain to be the best place in Europe to start, grow and run a business, schools where we are not lagging in the tables but we’re absolutely busting through the top, a welfare system where it pays to work, where you’re always better off in work. And from this a sense that the values of the country will have changed to be ones where people feel deep national pride.” A bit like Mr Blair’s Cool Britannia, then? “It’s not cool,” he says. “It’s more down to earth.”


For Mr Cameron, his economic record is the key to electoral success. “We’ve all got lots of dreams and visions in politics but in the end none of them is deliverable unless the fundamentals are right.” He believes the voters will reward a party which stuck to its plan — a tight fiscal consolidation backed by loose monetary policy — even when things looked very sticky in 2012.


While the International Monetary Fund and economists urged the government to change course, he says the counsel of Ken Clarke, a former chancellor of the exchequer, was crucial in maintaining cabinet support. “He sat round the cabinet table and said, look, this is going to take longer than you think, stick with it — there’s no alternative package,” Mr Cameron recalls.


The prime minister says the aim is to keep squeezing public spending, especially welfare, until the public finances are back in the black in the second half of the next parliament. “We should be targeting a surplus after seven years or you never will,” he says. He refuses to say how big the surplus should be and shies away from confirming that the Tories are targeting a £23bn surplus by 2020, an ambition which would leave Britain with the smallest state, as a share of GDP, since the 1930s.

George Osborne, his chancellor of the exchequer, may pare back this notional surplus in his Budget next week, using the spare cash to soften his austerity plans and offer the prospect of tax cuts.
Apart from presiding over a private-sector led recovery, Mr Cameron says he hopes to be remembered as the prime minister who resolves the country’s two existential questions in the first part of the 21st century. “One is, does the United Kingdom want to stay together? Yes. Secondly, does the United Kingdom want to stay in a reformed European Union? Yes.”

null,false,TheSquareMileVampire,null,null,null,"Listening to Mr Cameron reeling off the objectives of his premiership is a reminder of how he has been defined by his response to events, rather than any success in reshaping the political landscape on his own terms. After all, when he was elected Conservative leader in 2005 he wanted his party to “stop banging on about Europe”, supported the Labour government’s hefty expansion in state spending and preferred to talk about the environment and his elusive “Big Society” concept.


As it turned out, Mr Cameron quickly sidelined greenery and the Big Society; instead he shrank the state and indulged his party’s obsession with Europe.


As for Scottish independence, he confirms he had little choice but to agree to the referendum demanded by the Scottish National party government in Edinburgh. “We would have been in a punch-up situation,” he says. “Instead we did the decent, proper British thing.”


Mr Cameron may claim to have “settled” the issue — the pro-union No campaign won last September’s referendum by a margin of 55:45 — but the SNP is still gaining momentum and could play a role in putting Mr Miliband into power in a hung parliament.


“I think it’s very dangerous,” he says. While he says that “nobody is actually arguing for another referendum”, the SNP is not about to drop the issue.


With his proposed European referendum, Mr Cameron argues that if it was possible to settle the issue of Britain’s future in Europe as early as 2016 he would be delighted, but thinks a plebiscite in 2017 more likely: “I expect it will take a bit longer because there are quite a lot of moving parts.”


Mr Cameron was forced to offer the referendum under pressure from the eurosceptic UK Independence party but says in the end it was untenable to keep dodging the question. “I think this is the moment when Britain stops sleepwalking towards the exit — I think that’s what’s happening now. The British public can see what’s happening: Europe is changing before their eyes and they haven’t been asked about it.”


He is demanding changes to the EU treaty, including on plans to welfare rules for migrant workers, which may be unacceptable to other member states, notably Germany. They may meet further resistance when he tries to exclude Britain from the EU’s goal of “ever closer union”. But assuming a better deal for Britain, he says he will fight for the UK to remain a member of the 28-member bloc.


At that point he concedes that some Tory MPs will “vote to leave altogether” whatever deal he strikes. But he insists his party’s schism will be repaired once the referendum is over: “I think there can be a coming together after that.”


Even if Mr Cameron settles Britain’s place in the EU, there are wider concerns that he is turning his back on the world. On immigration he insists Britain will remain open to the brightest students and the most talented workers but adds that the public needs reassurance that the country’s borders are under control.


In spite of the problem of homegrown jihadis, Mr Cameron insists the UK remains a beacon for “civic nationalism where different nationalities can live together in one country”, adding: “We are cracking one of the great problems of the whole world: how do you create a multifaith, multi-ethnic opportunity democracy.”


Mr Cameron’s rhetoric about Britain being confident and outward looking can sometimes run ahead of reality, not least when he lectured other European nations last year on the need to meet Nato’s military spending target of 2 per cent of GDP.


The prime minister’s failure to guarantee that a future Tory government would meet its Nato promise — British spending on defence could dip below 2 per cent of output next year — has prompted concerns in Washington and at Westminster that Mr Cameron speaks loudly but carries a small stick. In this view, the UK is a nation in retreat, short of money and war-weary after the campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.


Mr Cameron is robustly dismissive. He says “deployability” of forces is more important than “raw spending figures”. Yet he insists on sticking to his commitment to 0.7 per cent of GDP on overseas aid — one of the few western countries to honour a commitment made at the G8 summit at Gleneagles in 2005 — as a sign of the country’s global outlook. Asked to justify the inconsistency, he concedes: “It’s a fair point.”
On Ukraine, Mr Cameron argues that Britain is the “hard pole in the tent”, helping to stiffen the west’s resolve on sanctions against Russia. He is hopeful of a deal with Iran. “Britain is a fantastically networked, engaged and active power,” he says.


What about his own future? “I’m standing for a full term and that is what I want to serve,” he says, as the train glides into Birmingham International station. He sees himself as the chief executive — not the chairman, as some have suggested — with a talented team of ministers around him. “I don’t set myself up as some sort of El Presidente,” he says.


Many Tory MPs believe Mr Cameron — if elected for a second term — will step down voluntarily after his proposed EU referendum, perhaps in 2018, after eight years as prime minister, 13 as Tory leader. He once advised Mr Blair to step down as prime minister before he went mad and Gordon Brown, Mr Cameron’s predecessor, clearly struggled under the strain.
Will he follow his own advice? He thinks for a second and smiles: “I’m not saying all prime ministers go mad at the same rate.”

&amp;nbsp;

Long answer: It depends, but still probably international fees.  Firstly,  read your schools fees policy carefully. Then any terms they use like ""resident"", ""immigration status"",  ""home country"", or pretty much any noun (slightly joking) should be noted. 

&amp;nbsp;

Then the most important part, use Google to find then read through The Education (Fees) (Scotland) Regulations 2011 and any more recent  amendments. My guess, you being in the US and all,  is that you won't meet the requirement for ordinary residence in the European Economic Area (EEA) which means you won't be eligible for home fees no matter your citizenship (and despite what some people online may claim).

&amp;nbsp;

However, and this is not likely, but might be worth a shot, apply anyways and if you get accepted then get in touch with someone at the university and make a case for why you should be eligible for Home fees.  

&amp;nbsp;

Schools also occasionally have money set aside to ease the burden on some international students, so look into that schools funding options. 

&amp;nbsp;

Anywho, I hope that helps even if it wasn't what you were hoping for. Best of luck at Uni wherever you find yourself though!

What I will say is you need to get back in the saddle. Having a knock in a car can really do your confidence in. Having a knock on a bike is a whole different kettle of fish and can really *really* damage your confidence. 

I would take the bike out by yourself at quiet times of day in fair weather. Start plain and simple, get used to the bike again and get the feel for stuff. Take a break and go out again in those conditions. And again. And again! I used to just take the YBR out for the sake of it, just to get a feel for the bike in different conditions. I knew that if I could ride solo in those conditions at quiet times during the day, I would fair much better when it's at rush hour on the way home from work.

Following someone on a bike is much different to doing it yourself. I would suggest going out with your SO but have them follow *your* lead. That gives you some safety from them being there, but allows you to make decisions and practice roadcraft yourself.

Its very confidence building and lets you push your own limits on a bike. I have been commuting 20 miles into work on a 125 for ages now and I used to go so slowly round corners and roundabouts! 

After getting out with a group of 125's though and trying to keep up with them I realised what speed you can actually go round a corner (in the dry ofc) and still have control. They all had the same engine size as me, a lot had the same bike, so I could mechanically keep up with them, I just had to learn how and get the confidence to do it.

My local club is very friendly and are always letting 125's come along on rideouts, because they also have a lot of noob big bike riders that don't want to keep up with the old hats on their r6's :D And a 125 is fine at plodding along with the bigger bikes that don't want to hoon everywhere.

Other road users are the biggest enemy though and there's nothing you can do but try and anticipate them trying to kill you at every moment, for example I'll do my best to not sit in peoples blind spots, even if it means dropping back a bit so that if they do just switch lanes i'm not going to be there!

You're absolutely right about the normalisation of certain economic factors. While not a government service, the move of soccer from the free-to-air channels (licence fee excluded) to the pay channels was an interesting one. When I hear how much some of my work colleagues pay for their TV packages I do a double take. This cost seems to have become an essential part of household costs without anyone really noticing. A full bundle from Sky is around £70pcm and then if you add on the Broadband fee you're probably looking at an amount that is equal or close to the monthly rate of council tax (another element that used to be included in my rent when I was a student).

Yet if you try to increase a tax to pay for failing services there is a huge outcry ..

One thing that definitely changed the game was how the word Socialism became completely tainted following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Politicians seem terrified to include even a smattering of a social contract ideal. Dave's 'We're all in this together' trope was really quite pathetic, not just because we weren't, but because if he wants a social contract then he needs to build one..

This also has the benefit of people from minority backgrounds, and women etc from being able to see that they can, if they want to, go into these roles, and not just them but society as a whole, which helps reduce sexism and racism in other places.

Of course I believe quotas should be used with good judgement. i.e. don't just hire the Indian guy for being Indian if there is someone better for example, but then where possible maybe think of the other benefits that someone could bring such as community connections for example which can add value to the organisation.

As for Joe's comment, if private companies are hiring people to appear more diverse, that's up to them, again, it could add value to the company in other ways as I've mentioned here.

Sorry, that's your job.

&gt;We have working private models also available.

None of which match up. I've already given examples of what they provide that others can't/ don't. Your response instead of providing the equivalent says lots.

&gt;See above.

That'll be no actual facts to back up your assumptions, then.

&gt;But the Apple iPhones are for everyone, not just me - doesn't mean they're a public service.

Neither is Private Medicine - so why are you pretending they're the same?

&gt;Your entire argument hinges on the idea the BBC must be public. It's up to you to back up why.

Because it provides stuff other channels can't. I've already given examples. Since you're the one insisting other offerings are 'just as good', I'm still waiting for your equivalents. Odd, I thought it would be really easy for you since you paint it as so obvious.


&gt;Me and everyone in agreement with me, Me and everyone in agreement with me, do some reading and you'll see I'm certainly not alone in my opinion on a forced tax to fund the BBC.

Lots of people agree with homeopathy - but it's telling that you're now resorting to numbers instead of facts. Especially when those numbers would in no way threaten the numbers that oppose changing things. Do some reading and come up with real responses.

&gt;Which, as I've already pointed out more than once, is not what a public service is designed to do.

This doesn't actually mean anything without context.

&gt;Weren't you just mocking me for supposed pedantry earlier?

So...pointing out the similarities between Public Services is pedantry, now? Sorry, the definition has to change first, and not by your leave.

&gt;Unsurprisingly, yes. I don't much care about yours - they don't matter to me.

Just as well I haven't mentioned them once then, eh? Of course, that could have nothing to do with my viewpoint being based on what's best for everyone and not just me. But then that is, er, what a Public Service is for.

&gt;Are you really this scared of losing the television you love so much?

It's not about me. Would you really be that scared of losing an NHS that you never use?

&gt;Yes, I'm literally stealing from old ladies now. Well done you.

Sure, belittle reducing the funding for a public service and then it somehow doesn't happen.

&gt;Can we end this now? 

I ended it with the last reply. Your only option was to provide examples of these 'equivalents'. You haven't.

&gt;You've provided lots of examples and I've returned none to back up my claim.

FTFY.

&gt;we both know there are private alternatives to most of what the BBC offers

And we both know that none of them are as good - or you wouldn't have procrastinated so much avoiding such supposedly easy replies.

&gt;or that the BBC could be re-modelled as a private entity in a similar fashion and funded accordingly

Actually we both *don't* - I'd ask how you'd get private funding whilst providing the same service without adverts - but you would have given details before now if that was a real option.

&gt;If you can't think of examples of that then you're either an idiot, incredibly sheltered or being deliberately ignorant.

I've been asking for basic examples of your alternative from the beginning - let's have some of those first. I've even pointed out that you've avoided them again and again and what this ultimately means - and you *still* haven't. So yeah, I'm an idiot for hoping you'd given this any thought past excuses as to why you don't have to feel bad about not paying. Best part is how you carry on not giving them across three replies, replacing them with yourself at the centre of things when it's been pointed out again and again that public services don't work like that. And yet here you are, providing more 'solutions' that appear to be even less well thought out instead of backing up the assertion you made at the beginning.

&gt;Either way, talking this through more is of no more value to me.

Making assumptions without any evidence is talking something through? Righto. Because, even now, it's still all about *you*. 

&gt;Rather like the BBC.

What a stand you're prepared to take in order to avoid £12 a month on a service for everyone to benefit from. Wonderful.

Yes. Any indication to a recruiter that an application hasn't been written for that vacancy, e.g. it contains irrelevant information or doesn't address the particular role closely enough, is inviting rejection. Try to understand what specific criteria the recruiter is looking for and ensure that you address each one in your cover letter and/or CV. 

You don't have to make substantial changes to your CV for each different role, but if there is an opportunity to customise it - for example, to emphasise a relevant aspect of your experience - then you should, and always make sure that your cover letter (or equivalent statement if it's an online application) matches your skills and experience to the criteria.",null,0,null,1426241748,null,0,false,0,cpdiuuu,null,t3_2yw5mp,null,t1_cpdiuuu,null,t1_cpdiqsx,null,null,null,1427736151,null,1,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,1,null

Technically speaking, the Bank of England prints a certain amount of money every year, and this is distributed to the banks (not in such a way as to just give them free money - I don't know the precise mechanism) so that the amount of money in circulation grows slightly faster than the rate at which money is destroyed (because notes and coins do just wear out).

In reality, the actual money supply is much harder to keep track of. This is because banks in this country operate on a thing called *fractional reserve lending*; this basically means that they are able to lend out more money than they have, so long as the expected returns of that money (taking interest and the risk that people will default into account) is above zero. They also always have to maintain a portion of their debt in reserve currency, in order to pad against small runs on the bank. This is why banks collapsed in 2008/9, because they had lent out too much money, and *everyone* wanted their money back, but the risk wasn't taken care of properly, and so the money had just vanished.

In terms of money supply, this means that for every pound distributed to the banks for lending, £10 gets lent out (or thereabouts), depending on the confidence of the bank and who wants to borrow money. This isn't just the case for new money, either; it can be lent out and debt can be traded multiple times. This makes the rate of inflation (the rate at which money supply increases) very difficult to measure, and why we have several inflation tracking mechanisms - most notably the consumer price index, which tracks the increase in prices of certain representative goods over time - it's not as simple as just saying ""well, the BoE printed £100Bn this year, and we expect that £90Bn pounds have been destroyed, so the money supply has increased by £10Bn"".",null,0,null,1426242851,null,0,false,0,cpdj33m,null,t3_2yl43z,null,t1_cpdj33m,null,t1_cpdixmi,null,null,null,1427736259,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

First of all nowhere near most of the fanbase is actually racist - this racism shit is something that is prevalent among all football clubs whether it be against blacks, jews, etc.  of course i agree what the ppl did in paris was horrid, but the ppl at /r/soccer 's opinions are no different than the guy in paris, stereotyping the millions of chelsea fans as racist. How do i know that we are not racist????? Because at least most of the chelsea fans both in and out of /r/soccer heavily condoned what happened and both the club and fans are taking an initiative to show that we're not.  Don't let 3 ppl ruin the image of millions. This is like calling all muslims people who would gladly blow themselves up because of what we see in the extremist minority - something ridiculous i hope you realize after reading this.

Which leads me to my second point, racism is discrimination, a very serious one. What is racism exactly? Let me kindly get the definition for you. From merriam webster: ""poor treatment of or violence against people because of their race"". Now tell me if we replace ""race"" with ""club"" how is it different in whats happening in /r/ soccer?

 I don't care if there is an actual discussion critiquing the play style of chelsea bc of this this and that... Id love to see why my team played like shit. But if people are gonna gild and top comment ""FUCK CHELSEA"" and when someone genuinely ask why chelsea is hated ""x is a cunt so is y and z"" coupled with ANY comment with a chelsea crest being heavily downvoted just pisses me off lol. What the fuck did we ever do to you guys? Can't just we just have a fun civilized discussion? Banter is poking fun at something or burning someone which nobody condones, but the current situation at /r/soccer is just blatant hate and discrimination.

Besides, if it was an issue with the players, it should have been dealt at half time because the red card happened around 30 minutes in. If anything, we played even worse in the second half.

Alcaraz was shaky as fuck to begin with, but grew into the game as time went on and if Seamus Coleman hadn't had the season he had last year, I'd think he was a limited clogger who can't do much but run (the ball out of play) this season.

Garbutt continues to do well, even if he hasn't quite got the nous to be truly effective in the back end as well as his frankly offensive set piece delivery, but I wouldn't want to praise him too much in case he goes and up sticks to someone else for fuck all in the summer. Probably someone annoying... like West Ham. Sign it!

Jagielka was magnificent. His supporting runs on the counter attack put the rest of our midfield (the committed McCarthy aside) to shame whilst taking no prisoners at the back. He's a proper centre half and I adore him like no other since Dave Watson.

Actually, to say McCarthy was committed is an understatement, he sets the tone and it's up to the rest of the team to go with him, when they do (like the 31st-90th minutes last night) the opposition cannot live with our style. The tempo makes it work. There's a quite beautiful marriage in there somewhere between the Everton effort, fight and fire, and the Spanish possession model. It's unique, I feel, and it's aided of course by the effort and deadly finishing of Stevie Naismith, even if his link up play continues to be fairly wayward.

Every time Tim Howard comes off his line a member of his family dies, but Kyiv's goal was fairly savvy and I don't really place the blame at anyone's feet, not even Ross Barkley whose confidence looks absolutely shot, couldn't control a television if you gave him a remote and then concedes a free kick trying to win it back 'enthusiastically'. He'll still come good, but it won't be this season, and I continue to blame Roy Hodgson and his constant public shaming of a twenty year old kid whose potential talents are a million miles above that dinosaur.

I've come this far, who have I missed?

Mirallas did well but he looks a bit out of form himself lately, at least since PENALTYGATE (Sky Sports TM) and I thought he was unlucky to get the hook for Koné, even if it was a system change. Arouna continues to do 'alright' but looks like a player who's been out for a year and is still working his way back. He looks an athlete though which always seems to make a difference in these situations. Looking anything but an athlete, Leon Osman is playing alot better since coming back, even if he didn't quite show it last night.

Which leaves only the main man, the greatest Evertonian striker in Europe since Victor 'The Arse' Anichebe. The type of performance that we have been calling for all season, a committed, powerful, borderline violent performance from this Jonah Lomu of a man, running with the ball whilst mere mortals are torn away by the very slipstream he leaves in his wake.

To expect him to do that every week is unrealistic, and I still believe he'll be better next year after an injury free summer break and pre-season, but if that performance appears more regularly, then £28 million is absolutely fuck all.

I feel that the current series of Topgear has been a winding down. The presenters have been facetiously treating it as a way of exposing their swan song. I have no exact references but the program has currently don't more and greater pieces, and things that seemed like legacy stories instead of just another lambo or mercedes. It's not because the release or production of cars has slowed down. 

Personally, I believed that this was all made up - until this story. In my mind, it was likely that the Beeb knew they'd run out of scapegoats and people who could get fired because Clarkson's work was released ""without proper examination"". 

I honestly believe the last few days of public appeal has made the BBC rethink this strategy of letting this TopGear thing die down. Now, I know that's a feeble argument because TG is obviously one of the biggest moneyspinners and pieces of desired TV as any market research will let on. The only way I could possibly think I am still right in the future is if MINTEL or some other fringe research company start selling TV insights.

If I am not right, what I am about to say is probably what happened and it disgusts me. Some producer got in an altercation. Clarkson maybe punched him and walked off. Producer files report. BBC perhaps try to spin that Clarkson is bad. Public support turns the other way. 
At this stage, the head of BBC production would be cacking himself. 

So then, the report is lost. The story is changed. The justice is not there. It's not time that will only tell the truth - if published details of the report that Clarkson supposedly filed is there.. then the details should sound reasonable and believable enough to cause Clarkson to get himself suspended out of his own personal motives.

null,false,Froolow,null,null,null,"When Boris took office in 2008 the population of London was around 7,812,000. Currently it is around 8,416,000 (that's the mid-year estimate for 2013, which is the latest year for which ONS figures are available). This means there are just slightly over 600,000 new Londoners in Boris' London. [Source](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/office-national-statistics-ons-population-estimates-borough).

The London Living Wage is £9.15 / hour. [Source](http://www.livingwage.org.uk/calculation). That means someone earning minimum wage and working a 40 / hour week earns £366 / week. The IFS estimates that this means that you earn more than 60% of the population (I haven't corrected out the cost of council tax because I don't know if you get an exemption at low incomes - I know it is possible but I don't know if the living wage counts as a low enough income). [Source](http://www.ifs.org.uk/wheredoyoufitin/). This seems very high to me, but I think it is to do with the extremely large number of people who earn 'nothing' a week - because they're homemakers, for example - and the high number of people on benefits / pension payments who earn a lot less than they could if they were working.

This means that of the 600,000 new Londoners, we would expect around 360,000 to be earning below the London Living Wage. So if Boris Johnson is soley responsible for poverty in London (which he isn't), 12,000 Londoners have reason to thank him for managing to beat the UK average and everybody else can just accept that London isn't so exceptional to be immune to the national economic climate.

Admittedly this reasoning isn't watertight - there is probably a difference in income distribution between London and the rest of the UK, there is probably a difference between newly-arriving and pre-existing Londoners and Leftfootforward use a much higher value for the living wage than I have seen before or could independently source.

If we just compare our front three minus Costa (Hazard, Oscar-Fab-Ramires, Willian) to other front lines, you can see what I mean.

Real     = Bale, Benzema, Ronaldo

Bayern = Robben, Muller-Lewa, Goetze-Ribery

Looking at previous great teams

Chelsea (04-06) = Robben, Drogba, Duff/Cole (with Lamps bombing)

United (07-08)   = Ronaldo, Tevez, Rooney 

Ac Milan (02-03) = Sheva + Inzaghi upfront with Pirlo behind

Obviously formation wasn't completely structured like this, and obviously it is not completely fair to not include Costa whilst including other teams strikers, but I just think that every other big team has at least 2 players who you can expect to hit around 20 goals.

Secondly, I know a couple of people who work in creative at ad agencies, and while it sounds like an amazing job (and it is) its also *really* *really* hard to get into, and stay in, and be successful at, if I were you I would look at degree options that will allow you to go into that, and build a portfolio of work that you could use to get into that area, but also provide you with useful general skills that you can use to apply for other more generic jobs (which any decent course will). 

In my eyes degrees generally fall into two camps, you have the things like engineering, and law and medicine, which have well defined set out career paths and then you have a whole load of other subjects which provide you with skills which you can use in a multitude of jobs. Lots of people are tempted to go for the first kind, because they lead directly to a job, but, if you can find a course you will enjoy in the second type you'll probably do better and there are more options at the end of your degree. 

So I would worry first about finding a good course that covers things you're interested in and then worry about exactly what you want to do with it, once you're doing a degree that you actually enjoy.",null,0,null,1426246125,null,0,false,0,cpdju00,null,t3_2yuepv,null,t1_cpdju00,null,t3_2yuepv,null,null,null,1427736608,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

&gt; Do you ever wonder why the right wing is united and fairly strong at all times? It's because we don't tear each other down over minor disagreements. We are willing to compromise and work with people who's views we may somewhat detest. As long as the left feels the need to bicker and argue, heckle and jibe, downvote or make personal attacks on all right wing opinion it will never be a respectable force in politics.

Do you honestly think that the 'right' is united at all times? How does that explain the Tory party and it's split over Europe, which was bitter and left the party in a weak position, especially during the early Blair years?

The manner in which Thatcher was ousted from power by Tory MPs? 

The fact that UKIP is taking votes from the Tory party/taking defecting MPs?

The issue is that you've made huge generalisations, you need to be more nuanced, I think that people haven't really engaged with you here simply as it's just a wall of text (which is also why I'm picking at a single point, as I feel it'll be easier to discuss things that way)

Running a business is usually used as an example because it involves a wide range of skills and experience. That isn't to say you can't get those skills elsewhere but for example a nurse may have lots of experience but it is more narrowly focussed experienced and so not as directly transferrable to the business of politics.

**What's your style of play?**

A poacher, getting in around the box, it's where I score most of my goals. 

**Who do you model your game on?**

Michael Owen in his early days, and obviously with Southampton it's Matt Le Tissier. He was my biggest inspiration from early on as a Saints fan.

**Have you worked with the first team?**

In the last few months and when I made my debut I was training with them quite a lot, they've got near enough a whole first-team squad fit now so it's getting harder but I still train with them every now and again. It's a good experience.

**Do you speak to Ronald Koeman often?**

He gives me advice in training, as do Shane Long and Graziano Pelle, with my shooting and movement.

**What do you do to relax away from football? Hobbies?**

I'd love to say golf but I'm not very good at it! I just relax really, I like all sports but don't play too many.

**Last album you listened to?**

Probably The Wanted, someone like that.

**Last film you watched?**

Fury. I loved it - I love war films.

**Another youngster you'd tip to make it at Southampton?**

Jake Hesketh. Made his debut for the first team in December, we're a good combination on FIFA! I've got a career mode on the game with Southampton at the moment, only in my first season so don't know if I get any good yet. I bring myself off the bench though...

**Best young player you've played against?**

Adnan Januzaj in Under 18's. We played them away from home and he was just tearing it up. It was before he made his United debut, but I knew he would make it.

**What would you be doing now if you weren't a footballer?**

I think about that all the time. I've always thought it would be nice to work in a supermarket. Don't ask me why. I've always found it interesting.

**Best advice you've been given?**

Rickie Lambert, last season when I trained with him, told me I don't always have to shoot with power, to finesse it more often, and since then I've scored most of my goals from that. I look back to that advice.

**Any advice for young players?**

Also I've heard rumours we could be going for Luke Garbutt on a free from Everton - from what I've seen he's a very decent young player. Obviously on the opposite end of the spectrum compared to Coentrao and Rodriguez, but I think that could be better for the growth of Moreno - to see how far he's come since the first few matches of the season is really exciting. He's been a consistent performer in that wingback role so I'd really like to see him get as much game time as possible. 

Janmaat would be a top signing, I was hoping we'd go for Sam Bryam on the right if we did decide to get someone, but if we can afford him Janmaat would improve our team so much. He'd probably cost £15m though, he's on a 6 year deal...

Obviously Lacazette has had an amazing season and is the man everyone's talking about but I don't really think he'll be an attainable player, at least in the next window. OL have a really good young squad, with a lot of youth players that have grown into first teamers including him, and they're on the verge of CL qualification and have a new stadium. Their owner has said Lacazette will stay until 2017 unless there's a substantial bid, so we'd probably have to overpay for him. However he does seem like an amazing player! 

I actually hope we go for Dybala, I think his ceiling is higher and he could score 15/20 goals for us next season. Lacazette obviously has scored more goals, but he's in a much better team and from what I've seen he is a less intelligent player than Dybala. He'll run into three defender and try to take them on instead of holding the ball up and passing it off, and although its worked many times for him due to his strength and pace, his poor decision making could result in bad form if he joins us. Dybala is a much better player in terms of passing and team play - I think he could fit in much better with us as a partner to Sturridge. I think Dybala will be better than Lacazette in two seasons. He could become the next Aguero you know.

Also, Palermo's president wants to sell Dybala and I think we could get him for around £25m, but we will probably have to contend with Arsenal and United if we do go in for him. 

Anyway Son and Subotic would be amazing but I don't think we could get either haha, maybe Son if we have enough money!

My priority would be 

1. Pjanic/Gonalons/Khedira - CM

2. Milner - CM

3. Dybala - ST

Also consider your dental care products (possible culprits sulphate surfactants, drying alcohol, fluoride) or whether you might be purging (acids bringing deep logs to the surface) or overexfoliating (the mouth area is more sensitive than much of the face, not everyone can tolerate daily exfoliation).

Your sunscreen has drying alcohol which is not great for the skin barrier, this may be contributing to overexfoliation/ irritation. Also a load of other potentially irritating chemicals. Note that not all irritation is visible to the naked eye by any means, once you can see it you are often into full blown inflammation. You might consider looking for a zinc oxide sunscreen which is naturally antibacterial and soothing/ calming.

Are you consistently meeting or exceeding ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle? Oily fish - experts recommend up to four servings a week - is particularly important in winter and when using sunscreen. But all the guidelines work synergistically to give a balance of minerals,. vitamins, essential fatty acids and antioxidants.

If you think poverty is basically a bad thing and something needs to be done about it, then you have to live in a shed and forage for berries, otherwise you are a hypocritical champagne socialist.

Miliband constantly argues that Cameron is an out-of-touch, elitist snob with no idea how ""real"" people live... with the idea being that being part of an elite is *by itself* sufficient to make the Tories unsuitable to govern, as it inevitably leads them to create unfair policies.

So it's absolutely valid to point out that if being elite and out-of-touch makes Cameron unfit to be PM, the same applies to Miliband.

Hypocrisy is one of the most damaging claims you can make about a progressive politician, and I think that's as it should be... if you want to abolish public schools for everyone else, don't send your kids to one; if you want to tax motorists more heavily don't use the ministerial jag; if you want to argue that your opponent is out-of-touch with the real world, don't appear on film drinking tea in a ""kitchenette"" that is bigger and more expensively-equipped than many people's main kitchen.

(Same applies on the other side... if you want to preserve the sanctity of marriage by banning gay weddings, don't go around shagging the au pair etc).

Or have the bollocks to stand up and say ""yes, I've done well but that just makes me more determined that everyone should have more"", but that means you might have to drop the class-warfare approach of arguing that just because Cameron doesn't ""live in a shed and forage for berries"" doesn't *automatically* make him a hard-hearted bastard either.",null,0,null,1426250224,null,0,false,0,cpdl0k8,null,t3_2ywfni,null,t1_cpdl0k8,null,t3_2ywfni,null,null,null,1427737184,null,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

This is supposed to be a place where Chelsea fans can discuss their club, both good and bad. People are going to have different opinions, people are going to disagree - and that is okay. That is what analysis is.

Yes, they had an off game. But guess what, people are allowed to talk about those off games. People are allowed to vent about what is frustrating them about a player or a style of play, that is why they come to forums like this. Some people actually want to hear the opinions of others. That is the point of engaging in conversation. Just because someone has something negative to address doesn't mean they are any less a fan than you. Being positive for the sake of staying positive is just as pointless as what you consider knee-jerking. Neither are productive. Neither contribute to the community.

When i post something that frustrates me, it is because I want to discuss it with people who are as passionate as I am.. not because I want to piss people off. The same goes when I post something positive. I would much rather hear thought-out criticism/analysis of the team or a performance on this sub than look at pictures of what jersey you bought last week or hear people complaining constantly about shit they simply don't agree with.

**tldr; This isn't just a forum for mindless cheering. Chelsea FC is not reading this sub looking for motivation for their next game. The entire point of being here is to share your passion, to discuss and to debate - the good and the bad. Stop taking opinions you don't agree with personally and instead engage them in thoughtful discussion, you might actually learn something. It is okay if people disagree. You may not like someone's opinion and it may very well be based on a knee-jerk reaction to something, but that is okay too - they are entitled to it all the same, and they should be allowed to share it.**",null,0,null,1426250859,null,0,1426262126,0,cpdl8n8,null,t3_2yv6nn,null,t1_cpdl8n8,null,t3_2yv6nn,null,null,null,1427737289,null,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2,null

Khedira would be awesome, brings that experience to the table as well as just being all round quality; though he's had a rough couple of years with injury. Gonalons would be better actually IMO, he's a little younger.

I like Dybala, but Ligue 1 players seem to (not definitive of course) acclimatise a little quicker than Serie A players and we need some making an instant impact alongside Sturridge.

There is absolutely zero correlation between class and honesty ('telling it like it is'), and zero correlation between class and propensity to make comments that can be construed as racist.

null,false,sometimesihelp,null,null,null,"I did notice it mentioned elsewhere about overpaying your mortgage - sure the (guaranteed) return is only as much as your interest rate but as was also alluded by yourself there is also the emotional return of security. At the end of the day certain assets (e.g. primary residence) are not about their purely financial investment and return but also about their emotional investment and return.

My only other suggestion is that you sit down and take a look at the long term figures and about why you are generating these returns (or how and when to enjoy them). How much money do you want to have available to spend every year (not including mortgage or contributing to retirement)? How much net wealth will you need to be able to achieve that spending rate without hurting your capital (say by multiplying by roughly 30 for now)? How long will it take you to reach that value at your current rate of saving (don't forget to factor in interest &amp; inflation)? This assumes you've paid your mortgage. By setting your original spending rate you don't have to frugal this just allows you to estimate (and a rough arse one at that, so many variables!) how long before you *could* stop working if you *wanted* or *had to*. Then lets face it not everyone wants to stop working that early but at least you now have *options* and *flexibility*.

Just some other personal points of view. 

But we have helped provide education, improved people's lives and they have a form of democracy that is nothing like they've seen before. I've been out there three times in the past 6-7 years and the changes I've seen have been drastic and in general the people of that country are in a much better position than they were before, in my own personal opinion. 

I think what most people do is make the mistake of thinking that anyone involved ever thought it would be possible to change Afghanistan into some kind of country anything like our own, we had absolutely no chance of doing that and nor were we trying to do that. What we were there to do was to provide the Afghans with the means and security for them to give their country a kick start towards developing and that's what we've done and good luck to them in their future. Yes when people compare them to us or other more developed countries there's huge differences, but that's to be expected. I'm very happy with what we've done there in general, yes there have been fuck ups but that happens in utter chaos which it has been over the years. 

It's a crazy amazing country full of some really wonderful and interesting people living in circumstances that are so hard to try to describe, all I can do is hope for the best for them and I'm glad I was there to try to help them. 

That's it really, I could go on for ages about the media and how they generally ignored the norm (the good stuff being done out there every single day) and instead concentrated on the rare fuck up.

Personally as I said before on this very thread - I believe we have the politicians we voted for. Ever since the late 70's there has been a trend for electing politicians because they can produce a good soundbite not on the strength of their policies, and this has slowly led to the state of affairs we are in now. The British public have nobody but themselves to blame.

The other issue is that we as a society often want stupid things from the perspective of what is best for the country.

Legally yes, especially when getting renewal quotes even if there's no claim made against you. The question is: ""Have you had an accident or claim in the last XX years?"" Answering no when you have is making a false statement in law and is regarded as fraud. If you answer yes there is always a follow on question where you select the type of claim and the amount. So if they didn't claim you would select ""At fault"" and enter ""No claim"" or £0 in the appropriate boxes.

&gt; I am unsure if THEY are going to contact their insurer.

Which is why you should. Under UK law they have a few years to put in a claim.

&gt; If I do tell my insurers (which I most likely will do) can I inform them of the incident, but NOT make a claim and keep my NCB and have it not affect future premiums.

No. It will have an effect. Even if you had protected NCD your insurance goes up. Contrary to popular belief, protecting NCD protects the discount you get, not the baseline quote. If they don't claim though, the increase will be a lot smaller.

You may find the quotes they get are more than you think and you don't have the right to argue the toss and refuse to pay and demand they go elsewhere. People seem to think that a slight crack in a bumper is a £50 fix. It was - 20 years ago. Nowadays its a good few hundred quid, usually more than your insurance would go up by putting in a claim. 

**TL;DR,** Legally you should, you may get away with it if you don't and you may find the cost of the repair a lot more than you were thinking and would save by not claiming.",null,0,null,1426255230,null,0,1426255475,0,cpdn47r,null,t3_2ywqiz,null,t1_cpdn47r,null,t3_2ywqiz,null,null,null,1427738165,null,9,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,9,null

A lot of times defenders end up with low ratings because possession and shooting doesn't really go through them and people are careless with timing tackles (keep pressing tackle over and over until he finally wins the ball so they end up with 4/12 tackles won). Do some simple things during the game like forcing [pointless] passes through him to the outside defenders, sending him up for corners (he scores a fuck load of headers for me and that appears to be the biggest factor for player ratings), only going in for tackles you know you will win (he is one of the best slide tacklers i've played with in the game). Better percentages in these categories should raise his average player rating each game. 

Also, every once in while I would throw him in defensive center mid (yes, even before Jose did) and put his instructions to cut off passing lanes (or something like that) which helped get him more involved in the game.

Not meant to be teaching you to suck eggs but only go as fast as you feel safe doing. No harm in going 5mph below the speed limit if that's safe for you - you will discover your own human limits as well as the limits of the bike this way. Not everyone can ride at the same speed all the time and that is fine. Your SO might be able to take a 40mph bend without so much as coming off the throttle - that's no doubt through years(?) of experience. You may not be able to and that's cool - just do what you feel safe doing and as long as you do it safely, then you're golden.

Reason I say that is I have been in front of mates on bigger bikes and I have often felt like they want me to speed up. I haven't felt comfortable doing so, which is entirely my prerogative. My human limits are not the same as theirs, they may never be, but on the other hand in a years time with a bigger bike they might be. Until then, I will do what I deem safe and secure.

Bars: It depends what you like. There are a lot of bars and pubs in Harrogate stretching from tradional syle pubs (Old Bell, Coach and Horses) to trendy cocktail bars (P&amp;P, Banyan, The Pit) to more rock oriented bars (Montey's, Blues Bar) and even a couple of hipster style places with board games and craft beer (Major Tom's Social, 10 Devonshire Place). 

Club wise you've got Viper Rooms and Moko Lounge for your dance and R&amp;B. Rehab, which is more of a late bar with a couple of dance floors, pretty grubby but free to get in and plays Dance, R&amp;B, chart and rock etc. King's Club and Villa Mercedes which are the strip clubs. Retro Bar is an awesome late bar only open at the weekend but then I would say that because I DJ there!

Shit loads of restuarants  - Italians (Sasso is good), Indians (Sartaj ftw), Chinese (The Royal Baths is spectacular and The Orchid is the best restaurant in town), there's also a really good Turkish place called Konak Meze, albeit quite pricy. For burgers try Damn Yankee. You've also got your safe-bet chain restaurants such as Pizza Express, Zizzi, Jamie's Italian etc

Cinema wise the Odeon is a fantastic building but it's old and tired inside. We are getting a new Everyman cinema though very soon which should be very good as the one in Leeds is amazing.

The theatre quite often has well known comedians on... Michael McIntyre has played twice as has Russell Howard. Jimmy Carr does the International centre quite often.

null,false,strolls,null,null,null,"&gt; a company that legitmally is paying a fair amount for a Intellecutal proprty 

There is no ""fair amount"" to be paid for something you're buying from yourself.

If a mechanic buys a can of oil from Halfords for £10, he's allowed to deduct that from the £40 he charges his customer for an oil change, and pay tax on only £30.

If I, as a small business and sole trader, got my mum to go to Halfords and buy the can of oil, then sell it to me for £30, thus reducing my tax obligation, then the HMRC would be down on us like a tonne of bricks.

If Google makes $100 million in this country then they can deduct all the wages they pay in this country, they can deduct the cost of all the PCs they buy from Dell, they can deduct the amount they pay their accountants.

But we shouldn't be allowing them to bill themselves for work done in their SF office, and claim it as an expense here, and we shouldn't be allowing them to fabricate a value for their own intellectual property and use that an expenses claim for tax.

If Google earn $100m in this country, then they can deduct the £10m they spend on wages here, they can deduct the £10m they spend on British datacentres and the £10m they spend on PCs in this country. But they should pay 20% corporation tax on every penny they transfer to their US office.

But if it weren't for tax there would be no reason for them to place a value on their own intellectual property. They wholly own their UK subsidiary, presumably, and if it weren't for tax it would make no difference to them if they paid their US office a $50m licensing fee for the use of their own logo, or if they made $50m extra in profit. They should just pay 20% tax on that $50m and be done with it.

I don't say this solution is perfect, and there are shortcomings with it. I'm happy to discuss those with anyone reasonable (last time global tax avoidance was discussed, someone went off the rails at me, replying with claims I didn't say). Ultimately, though, we do need to get together with other big economies - the US, the EU and so on - if we want to fix the global tax problem (but I suspect our politicians don't really want to).",null,0,null,1426257632,null,0,false,0,cpdocks,null,t3_2ywc4h,null,t1_cpdocks,null,t1_cpdlkhl,null,null,null,1427738836,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

My dad was, before he retired, a senior dentist. He was around during a trust re-shuffle that involved a lot of management taking golden goodbyes in voluntary redundancies. They got together at an event and planned it out - they all took their impressive severance payments leaving their current posts, and reshuffled into each other's area of influence, and into new posts with equal or higher pay.

&gt; 82% of the UK population say the government should have more powers for making sure ~~large~~ companies don't avoid tax

It's always ""large"" companies that receive the ire, but tax laws apply to everyone.  The vast majority of employment is from small companies though -- and they are the ones who can't afford buildings full of tax accountants.  Let's also remember that these companies often aren't paying no tax, they're paying no tax in the UK; they're using their multi-national status to pay the tax in the place it's cheapest to pay it (being in the EU, there's little we could do about that).  The solution in that case would be to start competing on having the lowest tax rates (I know: anathama), so that they don't all just incorporate in Ireland and ship the profit there.

So 82%, you think your life gets better when you give HMRC more power, you should think again.  ""Avoidance"" is legal; and in the vast majority of cases, companies using these so-called loopholes, are using the same allowances that were put in place on purpose to make taxation fairer.

Unless you've ever filed small company accounts, and understood turnover and profit, equity, captial and liability, then you should quit moaning about ""avoidance"", because you've got no idea.

Am I saying that these big companies aren't paying less than they should?  No.  I'm saying that if you close loophole #23677, then it's closed for _everyone_ and the people who will be hurt by that will be the little guys more than the big guys -- because to them, it wasn't a loophole, it was an allowance -- a _genuine_, fair allowance.  And when that small guy has additional money taken from him, where do you think that will come from?  Fewer employees, smaller pay increases, higher prices.  Again: be careful what you wish for.

They really shouldn't. This sets a terrible precedent.

Our country, and indeed all of Europe, runs on the basis of the rule of law: the idea that the law applies to every person equally, from the Prime Minister to the guy who collects your bins. This is quite possibly the most fundamental idea underpinning our society: there are rules, people are bound by them, people respect them, and if you break them you will be punished.

Assange being questioned in London makes a mockery of this principle. What it says is that an individual can dictate to the state the way in which the law can apply to them.

I've had mine from new and ride most days. It's got 25k on the clock now and just turned three years old last week.

Use a set of the Pilot Road series and you are set for anything really. I've run PR2/3/4 on mine and all felt great. I wouldn't use anything else in the wet.

The bike is fairly comfy on those long motorway runs, after the 3-4 hour mark though, your arse will be wanting a break.

Through the twisties it's not the most nimble, and at 245kg wet, it's a bit of a pig; that said, I take it round Isle of Man every chance I get and still manage to easily trounce the vast majority of the big boys through the corners.

Yeah, you will get your arse spanked on every straight, but there is nothing else that will put a smile on your face like heaving your behemoth round the outside of that group of latest gen. Fireblades/R1/etc. and leaving them behind as you dissapear into the twisties.

It will do commuting just fine, and the fairing helps a little with the rain and wind at higher speeds. Heated grips will keep you going for much longer.

At 6'4, 95Kg I'm a big lad and it will lug me around no problem, but two up has a little caveat. I mostly only go two up these days with the GF, who is very petite at 50KG (sorry dear), which isn't a problem at all, it's a little like having luggage on the back (sorry again :p). If your pillion is of a similar size to you though it becomes a bit unwieldy and quite tiring. That obviously goes for all but the biggest bikes, but it's worth bearing in mind for those long trips you mentioned. It will do it, but comfort may be an issue.

There are lots of luggage options and racks available, and if the pillion seat is free you can really load it up. I've shared pics of mine loaded up for multi-week trips before and it packs well.

This is a true work horse, a jack of all trades, but master of none.

I hope you find something in there helpful. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

TL;DR: Great all rounder, does commuting, motocamping trips, spirited rides and shopping trips with ease. Track days for begginers and intermediates only, advanced riders will find it to be a bit of a whale.

You are correct, there are [certain countries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gAwK36D3RQ
) which have massive problems with plagiarism and cheating. 

The international exam company go as far as setting an exam to be held on a single day around the entire World. Students are locked in the examination room until the exam has been taken by all the students in the World. Otherwise people in an earlier timezone can relay the questions to people in a later timezone.

Me, personally? Well...  
  
For many, getting the Bus is a necessity, but for a lot of people it is a choice. If you could choose between driving to work with the radio on and spending a little more money for parking etc, or spending half an hour on a dirty, noisy bus with a grumpy driver, you're going to drive. This is where my generation of drivers differs from the preceding generations. This is why I get so irate when I get issued a dirty or broken bus.  
  
People aren't going to want to get on a bus that comes from the late 90s, regardless of how much ""life"" it's got left in it! Customers don't care how many miles the propshaft has left in it, they want a quiet, clean and efficient bus, that doesn't look like it's going to fall apart before you get to town.

I'm going to make damn sure that your journey is safe, pleasing and timely because if its not, you're not going to want to do it again. If everyone stops getting the bus, who pays my wages?  
  
I will do my best to wait at the stop if I see anyone running, I will look out for people running a bit late to the stop, I will wait till I'm on time before leaving and do my up most not to be late. I will ALWAYS greet you with a smile, a good morning or afternoon and am happy to chat if it doesn't make the Bus late. I will answer any questions you have, will point out your destination, connection or further route and make sure you will want to willingly get on that bus again tomorrow.  
  
Call me the next generation of Bus Driver, but surely that's all just common (business) sense?

It's easier to get around in some systems, like the US, because a person can be charged in absentia and then it doesn't matter how long it takes to actually bring them before the courts so long as they are charged before the time limit expires.

In Sweden it's a stricter system that has very stringent requirements on how a prosecution is brought to preserve the requirement of a speedy trial. The guidelines make it so a final interview is conducted after which the charges are either dropped or the suspect is immediately charged and taken into custody and brought before the court in a matter of days to ensure a speedy trial. 

The final interview is the stage Assange is at.  Sweden want him there so they can take him into custody if they want to charge him to preserve the speedy trial requirement. It may prove difficult to facilitate a speedy trial if they interview him in the embassy because even if they wish to charge him they still won't be able to take him into custody to ensure he is available for the trial. 

I'm not entirely sure if they will treat it as an exceptional circumstance and abandon the speedy trial requirement in order to avoid going over the time limit during which they can charge him.

What annoyed me was the line ""Emre has thrived in defense for a number of reasons"". What are these reasons, explain your point don't just say things without proof.

&gt; Starbucks buys coffee beans for the UK through a Lausanne, Switzerland-based firm, Starbucks Coffee Trading Co. Before the beans reach the UK they are roasted at a subsidiary which is based in Amsterdam but separate from the European HQ.

&gt; Alstead said that tax authorities in the Netherlands and Switzerland require Starbucks to allocate some profits from its UK sales to its Dutch roasting and Swiss trading units. This is a common requirement, which multinationals meet by setting prices, known as a ""transfer prices"", for goods that pass between different group entities. Experts say transfer prices are also a way for a company to minimize its tax bill.

&gt; It's not clear how Starbucks allocates such costs. What is clear is that while its UK subsidiary is making a loss, its Dutch roasting operation has only a small profit. In the past three years, the Amsterdam unit has had an average annual turnover of 154 million euros but recorded average profit of 1.6 million euros, or 1 percent of that, according to its accounts.

&gt; On average, 84 percent of the Amsterdam unit's annual revenue has gone on buying goods such as raw coffee beans, the electricity to roast them, and packaging.

&gt; Starbucks declined to give details, or comment on what the charges indicate about the price its roaster paid its Swiss unit for coffee beans. It also declined to say what profit the Swiss coffee-buying unit makes, although Alstead said it was ""moderately"" profitable. Swiss law does not require the unit to publish accounts.

For one, he has been criticised, even by supporters, as being egotistical. His fleeing could be example of his own instinct for self preservation.

Moreover, whether or not he committed those crimes, a trial might very well tarnish his reputation and that of Wikileaks. Hiding in an embassy, whilst very difficult, raises the profile of the organisation and Assange  without doing the damage a trial might.

Finally, and perhaps most likely, Assange's ego and politics have made him a little to paranoid. He sees three governments and their various judicial and prosecutorial organs as engaged in a conspiracy even when legal reality is different.

The best legal minds have looked at this issue and concluded that there is no basis for fearing Sweden when he was comfortable being in the UK.

A European Arrest Warrant cannot be issued for simply questioning a suspect. So Assange challenged it in the UK courts claiming the same thing as you are claiming now. He was only wanted for questioning so therefore the EAW was invalid. The Court of Appeal rejected that argument and upheld the EAW stating that it was the equivalent stage as charging someone in the UK. So Assange fled.

The companies ARE to blame for these strategies that are not called evasion ONLY because it hasn't been proven in a court of law.

- gov ARE doing a lot about it - most recently there has been general evasion laws and now there is proposed diverted profits tax

- you can't just fix a few laws and magically expect it all to work fine - its sooo much more complex than that. for example there is nothing stopping countries basing themselves in Ireland and selling as much as like to UK, making all profits there (apple as high profile example). Once profits are in Ireland it is now up to Irish gov to deal with subsequent evasion... which they may or may not care so much about (they really like having the jobs there so they are less keen on cracking down).

Love the guy, seems like he's usually got a heart of gold and he's charitable, a community-driven fella ect. but unfortunately in the footballing sense he just doesn't fit with our style of play or BR's ethos. Hasn't been helped by BR trying to make a point to the transfer committee about Balo's failings, but Rodgers has a point... who knows how the season could've gone if we did end up pursuing Bony or Lacazette?

I'd like Pjanic and Milner to hopefully fill that void of Gerrard. Pjanic brings so much class to the centre of midfield and those heavy links to him when BR went to Roma made me excited. He can really pick a pass, and keep our midfield ticking. Milner is consistent, a big goal threat, versatile and has so much experience in the league. He'd hopefully fill that experience void left by Gerrard, and would work well with Rodgers' pressing technique.

I think in terms of DMs Lucas is quite good enough, obviously if he goes we'd have to replace him, but having Lucas/Can/Allen/Williams/Rossiter would be enough for me personally. Obviously we don't really know the levels of Williams and Rossiter but judging by our players who've come up from the 21s we can probably expect a pretty high standard haha. 

EDIT: so for our strike force I see us shipping off Borini and Balo. I think Rodgers really does like Lambert and he does provide a decent option off the bench. I hope we can get Dybala as Chelsea and City have so many quality strikers, so our only competition is Arsenal and United. If United don't get CL, I think he'll come to us as he'll see Welbeck and Giroud and see he'd have more competition there.

I'd also like us to get Luciano Vietto, but we'll probably go for the safer option in Ings. I think Vietto has a higher ceiling and for how he's done in La Liga (5th in goals per 90 mins), he has a very low release clause of £12m. However we always run the risk of overseas transfers not adjusting to the league, but he is a real prospect who could go big. 

So my dream would be Sturridge, Dybala, Vietto, Origi and Lambert but it could as easily be Sturridge, Ings, Origi and Lambert. ",null,0,null,1426263228,null,0,1426263601,0,cpdrlp8,null,t3_2yv2v4,null,t1_cpdrlp8,null,t1_cpdq7cp,null,null,null,1427740536,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

* Smuggler (cargo hauler of illegal goods)
* Combat Mission Runner

The last two aren't exactly main professions rather variations of what anyone can do, combat missions are missions distributed by stations that send you into active war zones, so you are essentially a mercenary. 

With 1.2 you share bounties across your wing, and if you escort a cargo runner, you get 5% of the profit, so being an escort is also a viable career now too.

If you like all of the minutiae E:D is the game for you, there are so many ""buttons to press"" so to speak, it's great.
