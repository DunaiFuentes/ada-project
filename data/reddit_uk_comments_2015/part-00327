I admit that was a little hyperbolic, but I'm referring to the whole 'solidarity for Venezuela' schtick and the effusive praise for Chavez's policies whilst never attempting any criticism whatsoever of what Venezuela gets wrong.

&gt;Here's a recent one from Cameron. 

Cameron's the PM.  There's a world of difference between the leader of a nation meeting with dodgy heads of state and when a rebellious backbencher does it off his own initiative.  I bet Cameron wasn't having tea and Jaffa Cakes with Morsi when *he* was a backbencher.  Plus - there's the point that Corbyn actually *supports* the dodgy people he's met up with.  These aren't just neutral diplomatic meetings.

&gt;Is Corbyn an antisemitic terrorist supporter?

I don't know, but the company he's chosen says a lot about his fitness to run a party.

Look, you don't have to change my mind.  I'm irrelevant.  The question is whether an argument could be made which could convince the British electorate that it's OK for the probable leader of the Labour party to have associated with antisemites and terrorist supporters - and I don't believe you can.  I don't think anyone's going to buy this weak-sauce stuff about how the PM's also met bad people etc.  That line of attack will be torn to shreds in seconds once every political commentator in the country (bar Owen Jones) explains why the two cases are not comparable.

null,null,StevenTCShearer,null,null,null,"I'm not sure if this is what you're wanting but I'll try to keep a brief history of Celtic.  

Celtic was formed in 1887 by an Irish Marist named Andrew Kerins, but better known by supports as Brother Walfrid, and was aimed to eliminate poverty in the east end of Glasgow (many of which were Irish immigrants), similar to Hibernian (Hibs) aims in Edinburgh. Our first match was played in 1888 (hence the year on our badge) against Rangers which we won 5-2 although many of our players came from Hibs. Note: Rangers and Celtic are Scotlands' biggest teams and are known as the Old Firm, the rivalry is one of the biggest (and fiercest) rivials in the world. Historically this is down to religion (Celtic was Catholic and Rangers were Protestant) nowadays that isn't the case as much.   

Fast forward a good half a century and you have Celtic's finest moment in history. Our manager, also a former Celtic player, Jock Stein (one of the greatest managers the game has ever seen) dominated the Scottish leagues with winning the league 9 times-in-a-row but he also is the first manger to win five titles in one season in 1967 when his Celtic side went to Lisbon to beat Inter Milan to win the European Cup (called Champions League nowadays). This was the first time that the cup was won by a British club. The team that played on that day are refereed as the Lisbon Lions. The special thing about the Lisbon Lions was that all players were born within 30 miles radius of Celtic Park (something that has never been repeated).  

Fast-forward to more recent times, in 1990's Celtic were in a awful situation, we were close to being in administration until 1994 when Fergus McCann bought a 51% stake of the club and floated it onto the stock market. He also, boldly, decided to revamp Celtic Park (our home ground) to a 60,000 seater stadium, the biggest in Britain at that point. This turned out successful as 53,000 season ticket were sold the following year.  After saving our club and fixing our finances, we were ready to stop Rangers (who had already equalled 9-in-a-row and going for their 10th) and with a new signing, Henrik Larsson, we won the title in 1998 stopping 10-in-a-row. Larsson is now a club icon usually known as ""The King of Kings""  

Fast forward to 2003, under Martin O'Neil Celtic managed to get to the final of the Uefa Cup but sadly lost. In 2012, Rangers were demoted to the third division after getting liquidated (ironic due to many of their singing were to make Celtic aware of the money they had and we didn't) but most importantly, in the month of our 125th anniversary, we played Barcelona at Celtic Park and won 2-1!   

Currently Celtic are a selling club, were we buy players cheap and sell them for massive profit, mainly due to the lack of money we get from the Scottish game (the English league gets a lot more money). We are trying to get into the group stages of the Champions League, we play Malmo and if we draw or win we're through.  

All in all, Celtic have a rich history (much I have missed out!) and are a huge club. We also have a reputation for having passionate fans, many players comment that Celtic Park has the best atmosphere they have ever heard.

In fact, let me give you my unsolicited opinions.

I think that /r/islam try their very best to be moderate, and the posters there will readily condemn terrorism.  Still - it's pretty clear from following their discussions that even moderate Islam is a world away from what we normally think of as moderate religion.  It is an article of faith for many that the Quran is to be taken absolutely literally and that nothing could ever contradict it.  (You don't get many moderate Christians who are as literal about their texts.)  They also have all sorts of weird discussions about whether it's OK to listen to music, or to laugh at jokes, etc.  Things which moderates of other religions would never see as an issue.

There's the discussion of the problems they face- and the solution is always MOAR Islam.  Even when those problems are caused by Islam - the answer is to crank up the Islam even further.  

And then there's the relentless persecution complex - in which they obsessively look for examples of how bad they've got it and how Westerners don't understand them.  Oh - and of course anything to do with Israel is played for maximum outrage.

I very very rarely comment on their subreddit.  I think the only comment I wrote this year was to correct some nutty stuff some guy wrote about how Darwin was inspired by Islam (which the posters there TOTALLY believed).  Still - it drives me crazy to see how ignorant they are about the world and how much their religion dominates their lives.

null,null,for_shaaame,null,null,null,"The case law on reasonable suspicion vs. reasonable belief is very well-developed, and I would argue that in fact in that scenario a police officer would have reasonable suspicion.  In *Shaaban bin Hussein &amp; others v Chook Fook Kam 1969*, the court said:

&gt;Suspicion' in its ordinary meaning is a state of conjecture or surmise where proof is lacking; ""I suspect but I cannot prove"".

Conjecturally, then, if a person is the subscriber using a particular IP address, and that IP address is used to download child porn, could a person with that information *reasonably suspect* that the subscriber was the person who downloaded the illegal material?  The answer, of course, is yes.  With the information presented it would be reasonable to say ""the subscriber could have downloaded the material"".

The officer does not need proof; he merely needs an articulable suspicion (that is, he must be able to put his suspicion into words) based on the objective facts of the information he has.  The information does not need to be complete.  Reasonable suspicion does not need to be even close to certainty; the so-called ""simple test"" says that reasonable suspicion may be as low as 2 or 3 out of 10 on a scale of certainty.

In *Cumming &amp; Others v The Chief Constable of Northumbria Police (2003)*, six people were identified as having access to a CCTV system.  CCTV evidence captured on that system was tampered with.  Although only one person could realistically have carried out the offence of tampering with the evidence, all six were arrested on suspicion of tampering.  That suspicion was based only on their opportunity to access the tape - each was of previous good character.  All six sued for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment, but the case was dismissed.  The court found that the arrest of all six having access to the tape was lawful, even though only one could have committed the offence.

So even though they each shared the opportunity, all six could be lawfully arrested, because the police reasonably suspected that each of them individually had tampered with the evidence, even though only one of the six could have done it.

This carries over to our example quite nicely, because it means that the police can arrest everyone who had opportunity to commit the offence (i.e. everyone who can be identified as having connected using that particular IP address), even though only one could realistically have carried out the offence itself.

Hi,

I plan to do a new build but I want a Corsair 760T case to last me until the InWin 909 case comes out, so looking to buy it second hand.

I've had absolutely no luck buying it on here before, but here's to trying.

Corsair Dominator Platinum DDR4 - I don't care on the frequency, would just like 32gb of it.

I'm looking to pay via PayPal, and I can pay with cash on collection if you are in the Sheffield area.

Even if Sizer did post links suggesting 9/11 was the responsibility of the Jews, that does not mean that he didn't highlight genuine injustices of the Palestinian-Israeli situation. Therefore, you cannot call Corbyn's comment anti-Semitic.

Regarding Salah, Corbyn said: “We had quite a long conversation and I made my views very clear. He did not at any stage utter any antisemitic remarks to me.”

Maybe Corbyn needs to spend more time researching every quote made by everyone he ever meets and discusses to weed out potential antisemites, but my guess is he has more important things to worry about.

What I find curious is the desperate attempts by Zionists to try and link Corbyn to people who have said inappropriate things.

Hi there, I'm looking for the following:

Any Asus X99 Pro/Deluxe variant. A USB 3.1 version is preferable. I only have around £220 to spend on a motherboard as I'm running out of budget. Would like some sort of warranty with it.
An Ultrawide or decent 4K monitor, let me know what you have.

I've potentially gotten hold of an Air 540 on here so I'm hoping this could also help me source the remaining stuff for my build.

null,null,EliteHunting,null,null,null,"That is big and really important question. One of our previous khalifs answered that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kI1DaoLqPw#t=28) but of course its more complicated than that though. 

I say the key is education + self identity. In countries where there are high amounts of terrorism are also difficulties in going to school. Places where girls get attacked or there are not enough schools have these issues, not just in Islamic countries but it is prevelent.

Also where there is education , people fall into extremist ideas. I believe thats due to lack of self identity. At the ages of 15-25 an even beyond, we fall in areas of our lives where the ground rumbles where we stand so its time to jump. That is when we need local leaders to take innitative to guide the youth. Our Ahmadi communities have programs that teach youth about community serving/volunteering (Humanity First / Stop the crISIS for example) and not one person through 200 countries is known to go religiously violent. 

How do we get muslims to do that? Educate them  on the standards of Islam and hold the people up to the standards of the Quran. For example , the Prophets (pbuh) first revelation from God was ""ikra"" which roughly translates to ""read"" ""educate"" ""learn"". N there are teachings to always try to learn, for example , a student may be able to not fast in ramadan due to they need food so it will be okay to not fast. By doing that people will learn the realities and learn some people say what they need for their own agendas n keep track on what is right. but thats just my two cents.

null,null,backtowriting,null,null,null,"&gt;How do we get muslims to do that? Educate them on the standards of Islam and hold the people up to the standards of the Quran.

Well, I refer you back to my earlier remarks. The solution to problems caused by Islam is unlikely to be MOAR Islam.  

I get that there are some inspirational verses in the Quran you can use as starting off points, but the problem with always turning to  religious holy books for the answers is that there's plenty in there which isn't so nice.  At least, not if you treat it literally, which many Muslims are apt to do.

But, I don't have the solution.  I don't think anyone has.  I guess my only thought is that we have to try to uphold secular values, including free-speech, and we have to allow ourselves to criticize Islam, just like we criticize any other set of ideas in a secular society. 

Lastly, it strikes me that the UK Ahmadiyyas (or however the hell you spell it) would do better to align themselves more with the secularists than trying to patch it up with mainstream Islam.   You're evidently much safer in a secular society.  Besides, the Sunnis and the Shias don't appear to have much love for your group and would likely persecute you if they were ever given the opportunity.

Thus he wants to have a continuation on what was built on the first two games (suggestions on what Brendan said, that partnership in the back is of upmost importance) to have solidity at the back. Which, so far has proved to be pretty reliable with two clean sheets in the opening fixtures. On top of this, Sakho just had a new child. So maybe Sakho was originally in the plan, but a mix of the unforseen (Sakho's child) plus maybe Sakho's doubtful fitness pushed Rodgers to pick Lovren and Skrtel to start the first four. 

That's of course a lot of ifs and buts as it is just pure speculation, but Sakho just committing to a new contract also suggest that Rodgers sees him in the long run.

null,null,NEWSBOT3,cnty-uk,Londontown,null,"no, there is work in the places *where you are*. 

You are also assuming that such low level work is a full time 40 hour a week job, when almost always its either zero guaranteed or 8 hours a week. Maybe you get lucky and its 16 hours but then they spread it over 5 days and the travel means you lose money getting to and from it.  16 hours of work is £104 a week to pay rent, food and bills with. Pensioners by the governments own assessment, require a minimum of £151.20 a week to live on. Thats what you get your state pension topped up to if its less than that amount a week. 


So then you have to juggle several of these jobs, spend a lot of time and money travelling between them because they may not be in the same town, nevermind near each other, and one or more of them will often will fire you if they conflict because they only care about themselves. And getting them itself can be a nightmare  - i know of a business who advertised 3 part time roles and received over 1000 applications for them - if those are your odds of getting any part time job, you need to apply for a hell of a lot of jobs.

Well , maybe they can move to a big city with more work ? yeah, they could. The last time i moved house, it cost me almost 2k in house deposits, fees, overlapping rent since the new place wanted someone in right away, furniture, moving costs and so on. I'm sure people without a full time income are not going to have the money to do it. 

These are all situations which I've had and still have friends and family in. Last year, a part of my family in the north asked everyone not to buy them xmas presents because they didn't have the money to reciprocate, despite both parents working full time but minimum wage jobs that they have to travel to and from for several hours every day. Yes, they could relocate (not that they have the money) and move away from all their family and friends, maybe incur some debt they cant afford to pay back doing so. They could get part time jobs near where they live and have less money and a far worse quality of life than they do now. 

That was my original point - people live in bubbles and think that their experience in that bubble is the whole country, so they don't see a problem. The reddit uk demographic is by and large employed professionals who work full time jobs at above average wages. We don't see the people scraping to get by because we've never been them.

OK, so you and your friends get warm fuzzy feelings when you shop local. Meanwhile, your local shop buys from the same overseas suppliers as big box stores and extracts surplus value from their employees via exploitation. You're just moving the problems out of view and sweeping them under the rug.

It kind of is, but it's not really like America. It's usually when someone really wants to show appreciation so they throw in an extra quid or so. **There is never an obligation.** If I was ever asked for a tip I would call the manager and condemn them for poor wages.

Tipping is cancer. The last time we went New York there was a brochure advertising $40 shuttle runs to the airport in a taxi from our hotel, but the freak wanted us to pay for the toll road once we arrived at the airport. He then started bitching about not being tipped either and called a security guard over. So we had to pay an extra $5 which wasn't agreed beforehand. (this wasn't just the ticker happening to go to high, the point of that taxi was it was an airport service for $40 which would be regular, rather than going a random amount of distance).

but ""ketchup"" is not necessarily a tomato condiment in the first place. Recipes for ketchup historically could include everything from fruit to fungus.

I understand that modern usage virtually overrides any other meaning of the word ""ketchup"" in the western world, but it really surprises me that a country like Israel with such a diverse confluence of cultures would have a qualification like this. According to this particular Israeli food regulation, ""ketchup"" is a word that exclusively refers to a 41% tomato-based condiment.

null,null,CheekyLittleCunt,null,null,null,"Let's say the government spends x amount in a year on public services; they allocate the money they have and split off portions into budgets for health, education, roads etc. Schools and hospitals will get a certain amount of money, councils will get a chunk, maybe british farms will get a grant from the government (a subsidy) in order to keep operating and competing with cheaper foreign imports, maybe a centre for disabled children will receive a portion, a homeless charity might get help from the government to help out on London streets. You get the idea. 

Austerity measures are when the government says ""Look, we're in debt, we need to repay back some of our loans, but we're just spending too much. Cuts need to be made"". So they start giving less money to hospitals and schools and councils and farmers and their x budget is now y, where y is lower than x. Less money for these places means they have to start cutting corners too; some schools might decline academically or stop offering as many different courses or higher fewer/less skilled teachers, hospital staff might end up stretched thin due to lack of budget to hire more staff, prescriptions and medications end up costing more, potholes start taking longer to be filled, some roads stop being salted in the winter, british beef might start costing more. Austerity cuts to public services end up affecting the general public, and the working class, much more than the rich (who cares if NHS services are getting worse when you can just use your private health insurance). 

So austerity is the general idea of ""making cuts during hard times"". It could either be because a government needs to pay off debt, or has run out of money because of an economic crash/expensive war. It's the same concept as you skipping a night out on the town because you're too broke, or buying cheaper off brand stuff at the supermarket, less money = less quality. 

Some people oppose austerity because they feel the poor and disabled are heavily damaged by it and it's harmful for society, they say that the money doesn't need to be cut from public services. (For example, NHS budgets are being slashed, yet the government are about to drop £2.9billion /a year/ in order to build and maintain a new nuclear weapons system). Some people think that austerity is necessary in order to make sure that we as a country stay above the red line and have manageable debt. A lot of those people think that the government spend way too much on public services anyway and that they are unfairly being taxed for government overspending, they would rather budgets were cut than their taxes risen. These people tend to be more conservative and aim for a smaller government that is less prevalent in people's lives (stating that the free market will provide as necessary). More left leaning and socialist political parties believe that austerity is bad for the common man and the lowest members of society and we should be spending more money on giving the disabled and poor better lives and more support and opportunities.

You'll pay a co-pay of anywhere from $20 to $70 or 20% to 40% of the total bill, depending on how crappy your insurance is. Same with ER visits, specialists, etc. 

Then there's prescription costs. Generic prescriptions will cost between $10 to $30 a time. Meds which are too new to have a generic equivalent can cost a small fortune, regardless of your insurance. A friend of mine is on one that costs her $1600 a month even with insurance.

Then there's the fun of medical billing. I went in to a day surgery center (because an overnight stay can be ruinously expensive) for a ligament repair on my knee. I got 3 bills - one from the surgeon, one from the anesthesiologist  and one from the facility itself. Again, co-pays on all of them and 9 times out of 10 the bills are wrong. Arguing with facilities and insurance companies after surgeries can be a full time job in itself.

If you would prefer you can bypass us and donate directly to HFSG here. - See more at: http://www.liverpooltees.com/hfsg/#sthash.SrB7divO.dpuf

null,null,prnfce,EN,england,null,"&gt; Ramires isn't Chelsea quality right now and he's still on the team. I refuse to accept that Xhaka isn't good enough for us if Ramires is still on the team getting meaningful minutes.

was he in the squad or on the bench today, the answer is no.

&gt;Also, according to people who ACTUALLY watch the Bundesliga, Baba Rahman was the best LB in the league last year, so yeah

According to people that watched la liga Filipe luis was the best LB in the league the year before last, yet the premier league games told a different story - People who watch tv aren't always the best people to listen to.

&gt;I'd say we brought him in because we're fairly confident he can play immediately at a high level.

Yet he didn't feature yesterday and pedro did, in jose mourinho's interivew on chelseatv about the signing of baba he said ""Baba is a young player with lots of potential, pedro is one of the best players in the world""

When questioned what he likes about Baba he replied ""A left back who needs to improve, needs to learn obviously - but the potential is there."" 

Similar to what Jose had to say about Zouma when he joined so i wouldn't expect an immediate impact, and i definitely wouldn't expect us to be buying players like Xhaka to break into the first 11.

&gt;Y'all need to stop underestimating players in the Bundesliga.

You need to stop over rating players in the Bundesliga, sure they have talented players De Bruyne a player i always liked shines there, though its hard to argue he had a harder time performing in the premier league.

I am more than capable of working, and have learned the ability to bullshit my way through interviews and general interactions with people in a work environment, which I fear and loathe in equal measure.

Barely enough to get by on.

It is a policy that is touted as one for reducing the national debt whilst maintaining economic growth.  No one has asked why we need to reduce the national debt, this is just a given.

The reality is that plenty of rich people are making money out of the policy.

There are things we no longer question, statements such as we need to grow our economy are simply accepted and not questioned.

Growing our economy does 2 thing, it outstrips our labour supply, necessitating the import of labour from outside our economy and it make more profits for those in control.

To normal people it has no benefit, it just makes us feel miserable and poor.  The lack of challenge to this policy is breathtaking.  

We could easily sacrifice economic growth to avoid Austerity but it is never suggested, because economic growth is the sacred cow of government, but just as when the emperor has no clothes, there is no sacred cow.  The need to maintain growth is a fallacy.

null,null,specialkkurtis,null,null,null,"Hello, I travel from Abingdon to UCL a few days a week and have done for two years. Before that I travelled from Headington to the City and then Headington to UCL for two years. I've used the X90 for all of that time.

I've never bothered with the train as it was too pricey for me.

This is my commute routine:

* 5:00am - Wake up
* 5:30am - Leave the house, walk to Oxford Road
* 5:45am - 6:00am - Reach bus stop and get X3/X13 to Speedwell St (near Christ Church)
* 6:00am - 6:15am - Get on X90
* 6:15am - 8:00am - Sleep, read, do some work, listen to audiobooks
* 8:00am - Arrive at Baker St, walk to Waitrose on Marylebone High St to get a free coffee and walk to UCL
* 8:20AM - Arrive at UCL and sit on the steps and drink coffee/eat breakfast.
* ...
* 15:00pm - Leave UCL
* ...
* 17:30-18:00pm - Arrive home

Luckily I only do this maybe twice a week. Any more and it would kill me. I did it 5 days a week when I worked in London and that's why I quit the job!

I never use the Tube on the morning. The walk from Baker St to UCL isn't too long and is quite nice if you cut through Devonshire St and the like.

The journey London-Oxford is always quicker, which is nice.

Audiobooks are your friend. I got a few and love them. I then downloaded pretty much every audiobook I could get. They make the journey so much nicer.

I've never had a problem getting a seat on the coach. I'm generally one of the first people on the coach at Speedwell St.

Costa, he started off poor looking and complaining at the ref. In the Sunday game he looked mean he heled the ball up very well and when defenders get to tight, he just turns on them and gets a shot off. I think we have our Costa back... YES!!

Pedro gives the team a directness to run in behind and pick the ball up on a fast counter. He can also dribble very well beat and leave opposition for dead with his pace. His work ethic with or without the ball is admirable.. something the our team should look at more.

Willian, I don't know how I feel about him at the No. 10 roll I think that Oscar would be better and I think that he would shoot on target more then Willian and if it's on target always a chance to score.

* The government spends money on services such as hospitals, schools, and defence capabilities.

* If the government spending on the above, exceeds the amount of money that the government takes in in taxes, the government has to borrow the difference (which is called the deficit). As a result, the government's total amount of debt increases.

* **Austerity is when the government's borrowing this year is smaller than last year's**, and is typically done through reducing government spending. 

* The purpose of austerity is to borrow less, which means the deficit is smaller, therefore total debt level won't increase as fast/will start to fall.

I watched him very closely against Leicester, mainly because my post about him needing to play as a 10 gaining lots of attention JUST before the match, and then he had his chance with Eriksen out. Also, he hasn't had a run of games there, so you can't expect him to excel straight away there. 

I noticed a lot Lamela did right, even a couple of nice moves (and he got overly criticized for anything 'wrong') but he just had no options to exploit, especially with them defending 11 behind the ball. In the Leicester game, they had their forwards defending on the edge of the box. What can he do there? Most 10's in world football struggle in games like that.

I know we want him to ''do it all'', like Bale, who could be totally anonymous for 85 minutes then blast one in. But he's not naturally that type of player. He has the tools to do so, Zeman had them sprinting in training at Roma and he was the quickest with a great time, and he has a good shot. But he's naturally a 10. Eriksen is more of a 'take on a player' guy than Lamela is. 

Our team lacks pace to stretch and worry defenders, with no real movement. This is the case *regardless* of if Erik plays. It's not a Lamela issue, I see this in every Match Thread where people bemoan our mindless passing and lack of movement. There's no real intent behind it, no rushing counter attacks, no fast play. Lamela has the talent, the vision, and that spark to do the unexpected in a set up like that, but he can't do that without options in the current team. Hence why Berahino is a target, and Njie was purchased.

I also have followed him for years, and have wrote many posts highlighting his days at River even and games, notably vs Boca and Riquelme where he excelled so young, in such a huge game, as a 10. 

How long do we keep blaming the players for flopping, 'not adjusting', and realize it's a team issue? This has happened with so many of our players recently, and it's not a coincidence.

Deobandi:

&gt; The movement was inspired by the spirit of scholar Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (1703–1762),[3][4] and was founded in 1887 in the wake of a failed revolt against British rule a decade earlier.[5]

Again, 1700-1800's. Not 7th century. 

The most important figure in the ideas behind contemporary Salafism is Wahhab. In fact, most ""salafists"" are called Wahhabists these days.

Aston Villa Review: Episode 128 - Crystal Palace review, Notts County and Sunderland previews


Aston Villa began the weekend staring down the barrel of three games in eight days, both a blessing and a curse for a team short of match fitness and fluency. Saturday took Tim Sherwood's men to Selhurst Park, where Crystal Palace were gifted two of their three Premier League points by a remarkable defensive cock-up involving Brad Guzan and Jordan Amavi. Villa had previously pegged Palace back thanks to Adama Traore's ability to force an own goal.

In this week's show Chris and Steve look back on Traore's debut, a point thrown away and all the other moments worth analysing from Saturday's game, before turning our attention to the future and Tuesday's League Cup Second Round game against Notts County at Villa Park. After that it's back to league action and a brief preview of Aston Villa v Sunderland next Saturday afternoon.

null,null,frugilegus,null,null,null,"The explanation of austerity offered by /r/CheekyLittleCunt has the benefit of being simple and meeting the commonly understood use of the term, but the disadvantage of being wrong.

**TL;DR - austerity is to ensure the stability of government finances in the long term. That can be done by some combination of tax rises and spending cuts. Spending cuts are more effective, and fit the current government's ideological preferences. Some people who know what they're talking about say it might be better for the government to spend more money to improve the economy, increase tax revenue and close the deficit that way.**

It's a fallacy to compare Government debt to personal debt. The main reason is that a government can ""print money"". If it is running low on funds, it can just magically create some more by declaring that is has done so. This has consequences, like increased inflation, but is an option that's not available to individuals. 

Secondly, government debt exists for a good reason; it's better to spend the money now and pay some interest on the loan than it is to save up and spend it later. This is easiest to see in infrastructure; the benefits of a new hospital now rather than in 20 years time are worth the cost of the loan. However, the same is true of things like welfare payments, the salaries of administrators and soldiers and so on.

If you must think of government debt in analogy to something familiar, then the least bad way is to think of it as a mortgage. The government has borrowed money to improve infrastructure because the benefit of having the infrastructure outweighs the cost of the debt. (However, the ability to print money thing still makes it different to a mortgage, and unlike an individual governments have an awful lot of diverse assets and future income to encourage creditors to lend to them.)

A government surplus isn't always a good thing; it means the public are giving more in tax to the government than the government is spending. That money would be better used either by the individuals or by the government to do something useful. (The current government want a surplus to reduce the amount the country is paying on interest for its loans, and implicitly claim that is the most useful thing to do with the money.)

...so, given all that, why bother with austerity at all? Governments can sustain some years of spending more money than they take as tax, they can borrow for investment and they can create money, but eventually these will have inflationary pressures. The value of the currency becomes weaker, goods are more expensive, people are poorer and thus pay less tax, creating a cycle. Money is spent paying interest on the loans, the forecast value of the assets that those loans paid for was predicated on a level of economic growth. If that's not met, then again, there's a spiral of decline.

Part of the cause of the deficit (spending more than income) is ""cyclical"", it's just because more people are out of work, people are buying less stuff, so income is lower for a few years. The other part is ""structural"", the economy has fundamentally changed in some ways, and will never be the same again. Austerity is the adjustment to government funding to correct for an increase to the structural element of the deficit. 

This correction could come from either decreased spending or increased taxes. From an economic point of view, both count as ""austerity"". It's generally reckoned to be more effective for the government to decrease spending, because of the way decisions influence behaviour as a whole. (People change their behaviour to avoid taxes; they still need to use the services paid for regardless of funding and will get by with less). Both are valid strategies and are used in combination, it's not a case of either tax rises or spending cuts.

The politics of this are that right-wing government tend to prefer lower taxes and less spending on a philosophical basis (""people should be free to spend their own money how they want to""), left-wing governments prefer higher taxes to increase equality at the cost of less individual freedom about how money is used. Therefore, a centre-right government is inclined to use the more effective, spending-cutting form of austerity with some tax rises (e.g. the VAT rise). They see it as the least harmful way of stabilising the economy, because tax rises are limited. The centre-left sees that policy as particularly harmful to the poor (who disproportionately rely on government provided services) and would prefer a balance of more tax rises and fewer cuts. They argue that even though tax rises are less effective than cuts they're fairer (but would still include some cuts).

Another argument is that austerity is entirely unnecessary, and actively harmful to the economy, in the current economic circumstances of the UK. Rather than trying to correct for the structural deficit, the government should, for now, just live with it. If the government instead invests even more money into infrastructure and spends more money on salaries it will encourage the economy to recover and increase tax income to cover the deficit. Arguably, the government has been doing this to some extent, but many mainstream economists argue that it should be doing this much more. This isn't just spending money because it's nicer to poor people than cutting, it's an active attempt to stimulate the economy to increase government revenue. However, some on the left tend to prefer this approach because they see it as kinder and fitting with their agenda. Some on the right seem to dislike it just because people on the left like it, others because they believe the fallacy about equating government debt and household debt. The more sensible opposition see it as a high-risk approach which could cause an inflationary spiral if the government misjudges the stimulus, and austerity is a safer way to steady finances, even if it has a higher guaranteed cost.

If the answers are no, no, yes, then you should invest.

Timing the markets is a mug's game, and with a sensible long-term investment strategy the current level of the markets should matter very little. This is especially true when drip-feeding. If the values continue to fall you will be buying more at a cheaper price. You couldn't ask for much better!

null,null,dasblog,null,null,null,"Come on, you know why this has been downvoted. You're willing people to be made redundant because you had a bad experience with the DWP.

I think you lack a bit of perspective here. I've never worked for the DWP but the staff you dealt with were in no way responsible for how your case was handled. In large organisations like the DWP the front-line staff are only there to work with processes created by other people higher up. They have to follow those processes because that's their job and if they don't do their job properly they'll not have one much longer. So you want people to lose their jobs because they followed processes they had no control over.

When I worked in a previous job, there was a big focus on security and in certain situations people would have to prove their identity (by emailing in a copy of their passport or drivers licence.) In some cases it might be an elderly widow who didn't even know how to email, or had no family to help her. I had to explain that because of our work processes the only way I could help her was to get an email with a copy of her passport first and there was nothing else I could do. 

I could have ignored the work processes, but then my manager checks my work and I get reprimanded for giving money to a woman who's identity wasn't confirmed.

Obviously in a lot of these cases I took the brunt of backlash because people assume incorrectly that front-line staff at any organisation have any power to do anything. They don't. Front-line staff rarely get to make a decision, somebody else makes the decision and they do the work, that's why management exists.

In mainland China economic growth is slowing, wage costs are rising, as are the costs of exporting - presenting a very real threat to the Chinese economy as a whole. A huge run in the Chinese markets corrected itself at the end of July with a massive crash over three weeks. All of this led to China devaluing the Yuan several times to keep export prices low and support growth, but that apparently hasn't worked. TPP is in the water - China faces severe economic threats and doesn't have many moves to make.

The crash in China has spooked markets across the globe and everyone is trying to get out of their positions.

However they, or more probably departmental management, realise that when the cabinet say ""I want fewer staff"" that the cabinet definitely don't actually want a reduction in the output/productivity of the department, nor do they actually even care about the number of staff, and they don't have a fucking clue about the actual costs of the department because there isn't one big number but a myriad of accounting reports for different (sub)departments.

My answers are definitely no, no, yes.

Have just looked at Charles Stanley Direct / Cavendish Online - Cavendish online appeals to me more (in particular because of the Vanguard Lifestrategy fund option - I have heard good things about them from many different places).

Some further questions (if you don't mind).

* Do you know if Cavendish offer a similar option to Nutmeg, where you can invest an initial amount and then choose a set amount to be invested each much? (e.g. £2,000 initially and then £200 per month automatically put into the fund)
* Also, do you know if there's any charges for this constant drip feeding with them (I've looked at their website and there's a platform charge [but that looks annual] and a ongoing fee [again, looks annual])

Some more personal questions (since you already seem so useful!):

* Having read a lot on this sub, many people appear to be better off than I - I would only be able to afford £200-£250 a month to invest - I am worried this is not much and it's almost putting me off investing with it - thoughts?

&gt; First, we need a serious growth plan that boosts productivity. We need to work with business to double our national investment in science and create 2 million more hi-tech manufacturing jobs. With a vocational revolution – ending the age-old British snobbery that treats vocational skills as second class.

&gt;Second, we need to bring borrowing and debt down in a sensible and fair way, with a clear commitment to sound public finance – but with the confidence to strongly oppose 40% cuts, and maintain support for the economic infrastructure and public services we need.

&gt;Third, we must stay in Europe to support jobs and growth – and as an internationalist party we must argue strongly for that.

&gt;Fourth, we need wider reforms to the way the economy works. I’ve talked about a more feminist approach to the economy – developing free universal childcare, starting with the money from abolishing the stigmatising marriage tax break. But we should also be challenging the short-termism of what Hillary Clinton has described as quarterly capitalism.

&gt;Fifth, we must have an alternative to the Tories’ widening inequality. That’s why I will restore the target to end child poverty in a generation, campaign against the Tory cuts to tax credits, oppose the inheritance tax cuts for the wealthiest estates, and pay a proper living wage to 1.4 million care workers. And I have long argued that a 50p tax rate on pay over £150,000 while the deficit is coming down is fair.

She even quotes Hilary in a critique of capitalism, who bankrolls her election campaign off the likes of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs who are the peak of predatory and short-term capitalism. She says she is radical, but offers no actual radical opinion apart from using her gender as a means to push political views. Don't get me wrong, I agree with her senitment, but you can see how she comes across as completely in the political bubble. That'll be why she doesn't get upvoted, cause there seems to be a lot of anonymous corbyn upvoters about who aren't concerned with the other candidates.

Suicide is always more complicated than one factor. Compare the reporting of suicides that have proliferated over the last few years to the Samaritans guidelines on how to report suicides, in particular things like:

* *Approximately 90 per cent of people who die by suicide have a diagnosed or undiagnosed mental health problem at the time of death. Over-simplification of the causes or perceived ‘triggers’ for a suicide can be misleading and is unlikely to reflect accurately the complexity of suicide. For example, avoid the suggestion that a single incident, such as loss of a job, relationship breakdown or bereavement, was the cause*.

* *Remember that there is a risk of copycat behaviour due to ‘over-identification’*.

* *Aim for sensitive, nonsensationalising coverage*.

And so on. The lack of care and opportunism that goes in to reporting on suicides is extraordinary.

Was a genuinely terrifying experience; I'd only left the bike unattended for five minutes whilst I dropped off some books at uni.

I shot over the road at probably also around 30mph, and hit the high curb. It stopped my bike dead in its tracks - in fact the whole frame shattered into 3 pieces. I achieved enough air time to completely fly over the pedestrian path and past a road sign (about 2 metres) landed on some grass and skidded for about another 2 before coming to a stop. My bike seat swung up behind me and hit me hard in the back of my neck.

If there had been a car on the road I'd have been dead. If I'd hit the road sign that I only missed by a couple of inches I'd have snapped my neck. Doing this to a cyclist is definitely no joke.

A lot of them are quite well made; lots of people rant and rave that some Lexmotos are made in the same factory, with the same parts, as Yamahas. No doubt if taken care of like any bike should be, it will last a long time.

The trouble is though as you've very rightly said, is the depreciation. If you intend to keep it and run it into the ground, then I guess that's not an issue. But 125s almost always tend to be a stepping stone and one day, you will want to trade it in or sell it for a bigger bike (or another 125 - they don't last forever). For a new rider, it's going to hurt when your bike of ~12 months is worth about 30% of what you paid for it.

I bought my YBR125 for £1,700 from a dealer. I sold it for £1,100 - £600 loss for what was about 5,000 miles. Bit of a con there but still - I reckon I'd only have gotten £1,300 from it if I really pushed as the rear wheel baring was fucked.

CSD only levy the platform charge, so there are no upfront costs per investment. They have a specific monthly investment option where the minimum investment per fund is £50 or £100. If you make ad-hoc purchases the first contribution usually needs to be £500 or £1,000 but after that it drops to the regular investment minimums (this differs depending on the fund).

The platform charge should be the only charge levied by CSD/Cavendish. The ongoing fund fee is levied by the chosedn investment fund(s).

As for amounts, any amount invested is better than none invested. £250 invested monthly over 20 years and achieving inflation+3% growth on average would result in a lump-sum of £80,000+ by the end of it. 

You should determine which LS fund based on your appetite, capacity and tolerance for risk. This is a very wide topic, and you would do well to investigate further. 

Advisers use ""risk profile"" tools to try and help with this. There are loads available for free online, ranging from very simple ones ([Scottish Widows investment decision tool, for example](http://www.scottishwidows.co.uk/idt/decisiontool/decisiontool.html)), to quite complicated (Finametrica being the key example - free trials/versions can be found online).

There are also ""rules of thumb"" that can be used. A common one is to deduct your age from 100 and use that as the proportion of bonds you should have in your portfolio. If you were 20, the portfolio would then be 80% equity/20% bond. 

William Sharpe (who came up with modern portfolio theory, the framework for most risk management systems) invested in 60/40 portfolios to minimise regret if it turned out his life's work was wrong, and 60/40 is considered the ""standard"" ratio by many (particularly US-based) investors.

This whole BT vs Sky thing is really getting on my nerves now. BT dealt the English public a massive blow recently by taking 100% of the UEFA Champions League matches away from ITV (which everyone has and is free) and Sky.


It was bad enough when Sky won the cricket contract over Channel 4 (also free for everyone) just after 2005, but at least enough people and pubs had Sky Sports, it didn't close it off that far. Now you're telling me I need to pay for Sky to watch the cricket when it's in England, and BT when it's in Australia? I recently cancelled my BT subscription because it rose to £26 a month, when it was about £12 last year (off the top of my head)


I mean nobody can deny BT the right to try for all of this, and on one hand I commend their commitment, but it's like two parents fighting for custody of the children; they're probably acting really smug with each other with every contract they win, but the people who end up losing out from this are the viewers.",null,0,null,1440412379,null,null,false,0,cudr8hc,null,t3_3i6jef,null,null,null,t3_3i6jef,null,null,null,1441437761,null,14,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

Languages they use, they said they are allowed to use whatever they want as long as it gets the job done. They work in teams and decide within those teams.

Air shows are an income generator, and I believe there are usually some profits to be earned there. Not just that, but aviation itself is deep rooted into our history. 

Now people do not consent for aircrafts to perform manoeuvres above them, and a lot of them are done in land, though most away from settlements and places where there will be a concentration of people (air law), however, there are exceptions, and this is one. If one does not consent to be in the flight path, they have the option to move. This especially applies to Heathrow and other airports where people are in the flight path, and the approach path at runways. 

I disagree that this was an unlawful killing. Precautionary measures were taken, and there was adequate training of aerobatic staff. Is it wrong to risk the life of others for entertainment? Yes - does it happen more often in other sports etc? Yes. For my upset recovery training (as a pilot), manoeuvres were performed both in land and off land.

No, not at all. The problem with this suggestion is that it will forcibly shrink the rental market without seeing an overall drop in the number of potential renters. It's not like there is a huge number of tenants with deposits ready to go but they literally cannot find a single property for sale hence why they're still renting. Property is in high demand but it's not totally unavailable. Tenants who are going to buy are going to buy. All this will do is potentially stagnate prices for a few months, then price rises will simply go back to normal as the small surge will end. Then you've got the same rental market, with the same number of new people coming into the rental market to let a house, all with a fewer number of rental houses to choose from and far higher barriers to the BTL market, which makes correcting the difference harder. This will do nothing but put an upward pressure on rents.",null,0,null,1440416292,null,null,false,0,cuds9mj,null,t3_3i04gp,null,null,null,t1_cudr9hr,null,null,null,1441438247,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Now I don't know this field well enough to give a clear answer, and form reading the law the jurisdiction question isn't obvious to answer.

There is provision for copyright law to apply in the UK by reference to the nationality of the author in [s154](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/154) but I have no idea how this would work in a case of false attribution.

Similarly, with location of first publication ([s154](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/155)) there is an argument to be made that an online publication may count as simultaneous publication in a number of countries - though I don't know quite how this is/has been enforced at present.

- He wants to return to 67 era borders, thus forcing Jews out of their homes and making entire neighbourhoods places where Jews aren't allowed to live but Muslims are allowed to live 

- He advocates BDS -  specifically targeting the Jewish state for sanctions over other repressive regimes such as Iran and Yemen. Israel is probably the least worst offender in the middle east (maybe except Tunisia) and the only lasting democracy - it makes one wonder why he thinks Jewish crime is worse than Muslim crime.

null,null,JavaTheCaveman,null,null,null,"The S1 on its own - when not relied on for commuting - is pretty okay.  There are upsides to it for commuting, too: it goes right by the rail station, and their [smart card](http://www.stagecoachsmart.com/oxfordshiresmartcard.aspx) works well for weekly (or more) tickets.  However, there's no clever way to integrate the S1 with the Oxford Tube on one ticket, so no savings there.  

The biggest problem with the S1 is its lack of integration with FGW's rail times.  I frequently caught a train home that arrived in Ox at 1922 - just as the bus is scheduled to pass.  Add a few minutes' delay on the train (because of course it's late), and you get the pleasure of watching the S1 sail down the Botley Road without you.  This happened about 40% of trips home.  That half-hour wait for the next S1 was properly excruciating.

Now, this may change.  As Chiltern starts running to Oxford proper in 2016, maybe the times'll fit better with catching the S1.  Who can say?

If you have a car, this is a different story.  It'll cost a bit more than the bus (fuel, parking at Oxford City station), but you'll save a lot of time, especially in the evening.  Better yet, I'm looking forward to [Oxford Parkway](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-33199121) rail station opening by Water Eaton park-and-ride.  I'll definitely be trying that in the future, as it's straight along the A40 and you avoid central Oxford entirely.  Certainly promising!  Opening mid-October, I believe.  

I averaged door-to-door (Witney to Piccadilly Circus) about 3h in the morning using bus-train-Bakerloo, and 2h30 in reverse (add 30m if you just miss the S1).  A car, which I now own, would shorten this dramatically.  According to the route I may take via Oxfor Parkway, I may be able to get it down to around 2h (no bus, no central Oxford, shorter Bakerloo).

&gt; The latest Department of Health accounts for the NHS in England, published in June, now provide a full picture of the government’s NHS spending outturns and plans between 2010/11 and 2015/16. Figure 1 shows that the NHS will have spent an extra £16.7 billion cash over the six years from 2010/11 to 2015/16. Allowing for general inflation in the economy reduces this to a real-terms increase of £4.8 billion (figure 2) – a real rise of 4.4 per cent over six years – or an average of 0.7 per cent per year for six years.

Actually, this seems to be the case with spending overall, which has continued to increase since 2010 (at least in nominal terms) despite all the austerity.

But the situation is totally unique, take the following considerations : 


The following teams were included in the race ( officially or unofficially ) : 

* Real Madrid
* FC Barcelona
* FC Bayern
* Manchester City
* Manchester United
* Chelsea

Now, this is how the transfer window panned out for those clubs (till 24th August) : 

* Real Madrid : Have bought some squad players but notable buys include buying Mateo Kovačić from Inter ( for Midfield role ) further stacking their midfield, obviously Pogba wouldnt go there and rot on bench?
* FC Barcelona : Have bought Turan and Vidal ( from Sevilla) for midfield but wont be able to play till January, so that makes no sense for Pogba to not play till January, at best, FC Barca would make a bid in Jan.
* FC Bayern : Have bought Vidal, highly unlike to make another bid for a midfielder despite losing Bastian ...
* Manchester City : Have already spent close to 100m ( Delph, Sterling, Otamendi), look set to spend another 50-60m on KDB and can not afford another 100m on Pogba .
* Manchester United : Pogba's uninterested in United and they have 5-6 midfielders for 2 pivot spots.
* Chelsea : We haven't spent much just replaced outgoing players (Begovic : Cech, Baba : Luis, Juan? : Pedro) , Pogba likes us (via that FM post) &amp; London (some of his relatives stay here).Plus he is a B2B player, which we lack currently and options in our Youth/loan include MvG and RLC.None near his level of play and experience. So as a result of Other teams' difficulty in bidding for him and our need for a player, make it a unique case, incase we get into bidding, we are highly unlikely to be met by any competition...so .... lets see

He's got an excellent understanding of how banking and money creation functions, and writes clearly on the subject.

Now, in your example, let's consider the balance sheets of the operation of making the loan.

Before the loan is made, for simplicity let's assume that the household has £0 in the bank.  Now, after the 500k loan is made, the household has both an asset and a liability.  The asset is the 500k which it now has in it's bank account, however that household also has a liability of 500k which has to be paid back.  The net change to the households balance sheet is 0.  Similarly for the bank, the bank gains an asset of 500k (the loan) and a liability (the deposit).  Everything nets out to 0 on the books, so you haven't got any richer at all.  How you get richer is if, say, the housing market goes up and the market value of the house increases above it's book value (the value of the loan).  Now, if you default on your loan, the bank loses it's asset (the loan) and claims your asset (the house), which it sells to try to recoup the loan, however it doesn't really like doing this, as banks prefer to make money just through arbitrage and the like, and there's a chance it might take a loss.  You lose both the liability (loan) and the asset (house) and end up on the street.

Now, why doesn't this go into hyperdrive and cause runaway inflation, if banks can just magic money out of nowhere?  The answer is that commercial banks are generally very cautious creatures (aside from US mortgage lenders a decade ago), and will only lend to credit worthy borrowers.  There's no point lending 500k to someone who works part time in McDonalds, because they will default on that loan.  One of the reasons that inflation has been so low lately is that there have been very few credit worthy borrowers because the economy is in the shitter, so bank loaning (and thus money creation) has been depressed.  We can see this in [data from America](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/fredgraph.png?g=1Fbc).  Since the financial crisis loan creation (and thus money creation) there has been depressed, due to a lack of people worth lending to (and probably tighter lending standards too).",null,0,null,1440417776,null,null,false,0,cudsq9p,null,t3_3i0ze9,null,null,null,t3_3i0ze9,null,null,null,1441438465,null,2,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

Robert Peston did a very good documentary last year on bad debt in the Chinese banking sector (and worse, the shadow banking sector). It sounded a lot like China has a serious debt timebomb as the banks, and to a greater extent the shadow banks and even worse the Chinese Central Bank itself are massively over-leveraged and relying on massive growth figures to escape their debt (Peston predicted that even that wasn't enough). Much of that debt is tied up in the Chinese housing market which has been undergoing a massive boom, and worse, ordinary people had taken loans to invest in their stock market which is already in freefall. If those debts become unservicable and the property investors get spooked and try to lock in their gains by selling up, I'd expect to see an enormous financial crisis hit their banks. 

Given that both Brazil and Russia are experiencing a severe downturn, and the only other major economies that are growing are the UK (barely) and the USA, I think this has the potential to hit the global economy like a tidal wave.

Hard to argue with anyone disliking him for his actual goal/assist output last year given his number of appearances, not to mention that he truly would bring very little to the press, but I would disagree with anyone who says he's not a substantial upgrade on our wingers (save Chadli).

I think peak pressing Lamela last year could be more valuable if only for the pressure he provides, but if the Lamela we've seen so far is going to be par for the course this year, then it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see Bolasie would be more valuable. I wouldn't like Bolasie for 20+ mil, but if we ended up selling Townsend or Lamela to fund most of his purchase (and it didn't interfere with getting Berahino and CDM), then I would be a huge fan.

The implication is that this is something new, yet people have been accusing the left of selling its soul for power forever. So, her attempt to claim that this is all some vile consequence of Thatcherite policies actually ignores the radical tradition of which she is now claiming to be a part; indeed, this argument *has* to ignore the realities of political radicalism, because otherwise it would have to admit that it was the historical *opponent* of everyone from Hardie onwards. Instead, its current mouthpieces have to pretend that they aren't the exact people who tried to continuously undermine the people who built the Labour Party.

And Labour didn't 'abandon most of what it claimed to believe in'. Insofar as Labour abandoned the explicit idea of nationalising everything in the Blair era (which was not, incidentally, a cornerstone of the party at its foundation), it had already, in practice, ceased to follow the path of nationalisation under the leadership of Wilson. It instead continued to follow the path of equality and social justice which had been the aim of the party since its foundation, but found other means to do so.

With glycolic acid you really need using a higher factor sunscreen since it can cause photosensitivity, not sure if the Zineryt can too.

There is also [Active Formulas] (http://www.activeformulas.com/products/15-vitamin-c-serum) at £10 for 15%. These are both the CE ferulic combination that is proven most effective and most stable.

There is a tradeoff to be made with getting any bike - the most concerning for me with Chinese bikes is depreciation and maintenance. I am led to believe that if you look after a Chinese bike it will last you a long time, but if you are a new rider and have no prior experience then it's likely (but not definite) your bike might suffer a bit until you get the hang of doing regular tasks yourselves.

You just have to think that these bikes are built to a budget. Corners have to be cut somewhere. Yamaha/Honda/Suzuki cost more, but they have a bigger budget for quality control there. With a motorcycle, for me it has to be as safe and reliable as they come. I wouldn't settle for something that ""will do"", because I rely on my bike a lot and to have it fail on me could not only be a massive inconvenience, but could cost me my life.

""Negotiating on a ‘without prejudice’ basis means that a concession made by a party when genuinely trying to settle a case cannot be used against him at trial.

An example is where: X sues Y for damages of £120,000 and X’s solicitor writes to Y’s solicitor on a without-prejudice basis saying that X will accept £100,000 if that sum is paid immediately. Y rejects this offer; however, Y cannot refer to this letter at trial and X can still try to obtain judgment for the full amount of the claim, £120,000.

Essentially, this rule exists to encourage litigants to make genuine attempts to reach a settlement. It applies irrespective of whether the negotiations are oral or in writing and therefore applies to an attendance note of a without-prejudice conversation as well as to formal correspondence. It means that all negotiations that are aimed at a settlement are excluded from being given in evidence.""

&gt;The key function of banks is the provision of financing, meaning the creation of new monetary purchasing power through loans, for a single agent that is both borrower and depositor.

&gt;Where do you get 'go off on their murderous crusade' etc.. . what hyperbole.

What do you think they're doing out there? Arranging flowers? Or perhaps spreading love and tolerance across the whole world through the medium of interpretive dance? There are some videos, if you'd like to see what sort of thing ISIS is up to, or would you simply shrug and say ""that's only the extremists"". If you think ""murderous crusade"" is hyperbolic, what words would you use to describe ISIS military campaign?

&gt;A bullet from a drone? lol.. you have no idea what you are on about. Drones fire Hellfire's typically. Each is $110k+. 

I don't know much about drones, no! It will still will be cheaper than arranging for her transport back and a lifetime of monitoring / re-education.

&gt; I assume you don't want to target children? (Please confirm this, if yes we can stop this discussion right now as you are clearly beyond reason) 

""Won't someone think of the children?"" That's what you're doing here. Its an appeal to emotion. Of course I don't think we should be targeting children (unlike ISIS, who execute children and have them perform executions) Nice attempt at building a straw-man. It shows your argument is weak.

&gt;Your attitude is short sighted. We need to stop people from going and tough love attitude hasn't worked yet, why not get some of these people back and have them talk to other like minded people about the horrors...?

Its not ""tough love"". There is no love here. These people are fools. Those who believe in the cause will write it off as propaganda anyway. Any attempt by us to use them for propaganda purposes is likely to backfire. Appeasement is not something that has worked historically I don't think it will work in this instance on a large scale. This sort of thing might put a few people off, but I doubt the cognitive abilities or mental health of people that choose to join up with these monsters. I also doubt our own government's ability to assess whether someone was involved in war crimes or not, but that’s a different matter.

In all honesty, though, I believe the government will let the kids in, arrest her and then she'll be a spokesperson against joining after a few years of re-education. We wont really be able to measure how effective she is so some will say that it was a waste of time and resources and others will say it was successful.

Nonsense. This whole argument balances on the belief that there are swathes of tenants out there with full deposits ready to buy a house, but they simply cannot find a single house for sale anywhere. This is clearly not true in the least as tenants with deposits will buy houses anyway. There is a lot more interest in buying than houses available but this just means the market moves quickly. It's not like every estate agent's window is void due to not a single house being available.

Tenants won't buy in any greater numbers. They will simply have more choice to buy from, and more time to make up their minds for a limited time until the surge ends.

Even if it drops another 20-30% it'd still be up 100% on 18 months, which is probably still the best return you could of got anywhere! 

The big problem is the investor demographics, most other markets are made up overwhelmingly of institutional investors, globally diversified with huge portfolios and equity buffers to absorb losses in one part of the world with gains on the other. But for China, the majority (80% I think!) are private middle class citizens, middle class people, uneducated in how markets work, likely only invested in single stocks/sectors or just the Chinese indices who got in late to the boom over the last 6 months or so after it had already gone up around 125%. And so confident was the Chinese government in the boom continuing that they've been actively encouraging all these little investors to BORROW money to invest in the stock market, overinflating it further. So now the bubble appears to be bursting you've got millions of lower/middle class Chinese who are overleveraged, got in at the peak with their life savings and have just seen the value nose-dive ever since and to rub salt into it, having to pay back the loans they took out to buy the stocks in the first place! A middle class that just lost the retirements they worked their whole lives for by following government advice is not going to stay quiet for long so the government has got to throw the kitchen sink at the problem to try and fix it.

Speaking as a staff member of the NHS, I'd say staffing levels need addressing but the quality of new staff coming out of University now is exceptionally good.

A&amp;E is amazing but awful to work in at the same time, it's obviously shite to be a patient in if you're not an emergency patient. If you've been in a car accident or you've got chest pains you'll be seen strait away, something more minor will see a wait and probably a long one. 

My experience as a patient has been good, i've been seen quickly, diagnosis to walking out of outpatients in a month for a minor surgery with a pocketful of Tramodol. 

I'd say the feeling towards the NHS is generally positive with the odd, warranted, grumble. There's no point holding it up as the best system in the world as it ain't, it does however provide an excellent service that is importantly free at the point of use.

Stats don't tell you the whole story, but that's just not acceptable for an attacking midfielder we bought for £30m. His work rate is fantastic, but people need to stop acting like that's all he's supposed to do. 

His biggest problem isn't even making shit through passes or missing chances he should put away. The problem is he doesn't even do that often enough because he's not nearly aggressive enough. For somebody with amazing pace, touch and dribbling ability, he doesn't utilize it. When he gets the ball, he'll only go until he gets to a defender and then passes it sideways or backwards. He doesn't take on defenders as much as he should. He also doesn't make off the ball runs.

There is undeniable difference between wanting to live in a country where there is universal healthcare, education and employment opportunities than what you just said. One is about providing basic human needs whilst the other is about greed and social advancement, making your argument untenable. 

&gt;Those aren't grounds for asylum. They certainly aren't grounds for literally crowbarring your way into other peoples countries. Being a refugee is about getting out of certain country, not into a certain country. They are risking being deported to their home countries by breaking the rules like this. I don't think genuine refugees would be so stupid.

They might not be current grounds for asylum but then the current grounds should be changed. And it makes perfect sense for a ""genuine"" refugee to take actions that risk the being deported as it is unlikely that they would have thorough knowledge of our asylum process. By creating a system that allows for people to enter the country as refugees, it would become more efficient and opportunity for initial education would support ""genuine refugees"".

This first rejects, the shared cultural history created by the British empire and those places that have seen a decline in what you call ""natives"" are exemplifying parts of British culture that simply used to exist in its colonies, and will much in the way that curry became a staple British dish, simply add to the current culture of the home island.

Except refugees are dying. They die from drowning in the Mediterranean. They die in refugee camps. Some have even died during the chaos in Kos and France.

I'm not really sure this is accurate.  My impression is rather that most people here are interested in whether or not the player purchased is the right kind of player for the job.  A player's ""quality"" doesn't just have to do with what he's able to do on the field - just as important is his ability to give the team what the team needs.  Last year's transfer window was obviously a failure, precisely because the players we brought in were panic buys after Levy et al. were unable to get Pochettino's first choices.  So far this year, it seems like they've been able to fill the positions with the exact kind of players we've needed.  For me, personally, I'm not sure Bolassie is the right fit, though I have admittedly not seen too much of him.

IMO, NO!

But the situation is totally unique, take the following considerations : 


The following teams were included in the race ( officially or unofficially ) : 

* Real Madrid
* FC Barcelona
* FC Bayern
* Manchester City
* Manchester United
* Chelsea

Now, this is how the transfer window panned out for those clubs (till 24th August) : 

* Real Madrid : Have bought some squad players but notable buys include buying Mateo Kovačić from Inter ( for Midfield role ) further stacking their midfield, obviously Pogba wouldnt go there and rot on bench?
* FC Barcelona : Have bought Turan and Vidal ( from Sevilla) for midfield but wont be able to play till January, so that makes no sense for Pogba to not play till January, at best, FC Barca would make a bid in Jan.
* FC Bayern : Have bought Vidal, highly unlike to make another bid for a midfielder despite losing Bastian ...
* Manchester City : Have already spent close to 100m ( Delph, Sterling, Otamendi), look set to spend another 50-60m on KDB and can not afford another 100m on Pogba .
* Manchester United : Pogba's uninterested in United and they have 5-6 midfielders for 2 pivot spots.
* Chelsea : We haven't spent much just replaced outgoing players (Begovic : Cech, Baba : Luis, Juan? : Pedro) , Pogba likes us (via that FM post) &amp; London (some of his relatives stay here).Plus he is a B2B player, which we lack currently and options in our Youth/loan include MvG and RLC.None near his level of play and experience. So as a result of Other teams' difficulty in bidding for him and our need for a player, make it a unique case, incase we get into bidding, we are highly unlikely to be met by any competition...so .... lets see

null,null,nivenkos,null,null,null,"Jeremy Corbyn could sack the Bank of England governor if they refused to print money to fund his spending projects, the leftwinger's economic adviser has suggested.

Richard Murphy, who is seen as the architect of Mr Corbyn's economic agenda, the so-called 'Corbynomics', warned that there was ""no such thing"" as an independent Bank of England.

He said that if Mr Corbyn's government wanted to use the cheap money from the Bank any governor who refused to carry out the plan for ""people's quantitative easing"" should be ""on the next plane"" out of Britain.

Under the proposal, Mr Corbyn would create a national investment bank to fund infrastructure projects which would issue debt to be bought by the Bank of England - effectively meaning the Bank would fund government spending on housing, energy, transport and other projects.

Mr Murphy said current governor Mark Carney has said it would be possible but other experts have warned the Labour leadership frontrunner’s plans would fall foul of EU laws intended to avoid runaway inflation.

Asked if Mr Corbyn would sack a Bank governor who refused to carry out the plans, Mr Murphy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Bank of England governors are responsible to democratically elected politicians. If we have governors who think they are over and above the rule of democratically elected politicians, then I'm afraid to say, yes they should be on the next plane.""

""There is no such thing as Bank of England independence, there never has been, it's a fiasco put together, a facade created to appease people to put forward a presentation of something that doesn't exist.""

Mr Murphy also suggested that the Bank takes its cues on setting interest rates from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, which he claimed was in fact influenced by the Chancellor because it is based in the Treasury.

He said: ""The Office for Budget Responsibility has issued a forecast which says at the end of this year it is expecting interest rates to rise.

""If you were sitting on the Monetary Policy Committee, might you take that as some steer that the Chancellor would be happy if that's what you did?""

Now there are a certain few fans who rip my knitting. 

My house has always had four or five season books growing up. A couple of adults books and a few kids. Now when the big games roll around the kids don't normally go wether it being my dad not wanting them to go to the old firm games or the European nights being a bit too late at night. Now these big games roll around and our phone wouldn't stop ringing with people asking if we had spare tickets. 

Where are the phone calls for 12pm kick offs in December? I used to get sick of getting into an old firm game to find some randomer sitting in the same seat I've been sitting on for the past ten years. Someone I've never met in my life and I'm expected to just squeeze in beside them.

Then theres the fan that expect the world because we're Celtic. Sorry but 1967 was a long time ago. Money has now taken over football. It bugs me so much when people get offended when a player chooses a different team over Celtic. 
It's impossible to grudge a player that. Money and Glamour talks.  Gone are the days of Larsson, Sutton and Lubo. 

My final wee rant are the fans who are calling Jo Inge Berget for everything. Why? For scoring twice against a team who failed to give him a chance to show his full pottential. Good luck to the guy. He's now with a team who's making good use to him. He didn't show any disprespect or bad mouth Celtic. He just done his job.

Anyone who attempts to do well in school is therefore either an idiot doomed to fail, or an *other*, one of those posh cunts with opportunities. 

It then becomes a self-feeding problem.

The idea of Camping as a holiday is the most ridiculous notion since the idea of Spam as a foodstuff

I can understand why, if you are travelling across the world, you would need a tent etc so that you can sleep in the wilderness

but people who go camp in nice welsh towns with perfectly reasonable B&amp;Bs I cannot understand.

It's uncomfortable, unpleasant, and unreasonable in our climate of ever-changing weather.

""But it's cheaper!"" - yeah, OK, maybe if there's two of you in a £100 tent with two sleeping bags it might be cheaper than a week in Dorset or somewhere.

But the campers I know (my parents) have probably spent £750 in the past two years since their unhealthy obsession began on tents, cookers, various types of pillows, and tons of crap that is basically just a smaller and more plastic-y version of what they already have in their kitchen.

It's at the stage now where their car (a big Skoda) is FULL of camping gear for two days in North Wales - I thought the point was to be at one with nature, not build a fucking village exclave in the wilderness

How could this possibly be a more valid example than ""going down to the pub""? Just more vague glorified BS. Have immigrants not contributed to British history, art, music, language, literature, sport and film? You can fuck right off if you believe that.

British culture has *always* been pancultural. There has been a *massive* contribution to British culture by immigrants and descendants of immigrants since the Second World War.

I expect there are comedians in the US doing material like that but we're generally going to be exposed to the more mainstream comedy. The US view of UK comedy could be the acts we see on telly plus a few other big names, that's stuff I generally wouldn't bother seeing as it's not really my favourite.

Spoiler alert: ""Breaking up"" is industry in-speak for 'their numbers from target markets in the last quarter didn't perform as well as expected and their sales are in decline among their existing demographic'.

The number one most tried and tested proven to be successful way of turning this around is to wait for the audience to mature, and then blast them with nostalgia for their childhood / early teens when they're about to leave college and university. 

This lesson was first learned by the recording industry when The Beatles sold more albums after they'd broken up than they did when they were together.  It is as much the formula behind the success of Take That without Robbie, as it is the continued existence of 'Now That's What I Call Selling You Music You Already Own Volume 10'.

It's day one of business school marketing and advertising.  Create demand.  Exploit assets.  Wash, rinse, repeat.

null,null,drunkwithanxiety,num7,,null,"It's not the transfer fee that kills you - that's just a potentially mortal wound.

It's that a high transfer fee indicates that a high wage should accompany it.

Suddenly your new boy is further up the salary structure than he might otherwise be with your current players.  Thus, players who felt fairly compensated 5 minutes ago now feel ""undervalued"".  In the short term, that creates disharmony.  In the long term, everyone you sign going forward plus your own guys that you extend or renew all get raises to the new salary structure, but their ""quality"" is the same as it was.

If you are Chelsea or Man Utd, this is such a ""whatever, man"" problem.  But if you are Spurs, it's the hidden shadow of bad future money that blows out of control in a few years with no appreciable benefit to the quality of play.

By way of a hypothetical:

Suppose, for whatever reason, the Powers that Be at Spurs felt that Clinton was ""the answer"" and Lyon managed to extract a huge fee for him. That huge fee puts him on potentially higher wages - let's say Clinton gets whatever Kane gets because Levy is playing ""whatever, man"" with wages.

Suddenly, Kane is now undervalued. Because he's English, because he's homegrown, but also because he's better, Kane now gets a raise the next time his contract comes around.  (And no matter how many ""5 year deals"" are announced, players can force a re-negotiation pretty easily.)  Kane didn't get any better, but he costs more.  Kane gets his raise, now among the highest paid players at Spurs.  Given that both Eriksen and Lloris are still considered a cut above, now they are ""undervalued"" and they get to push for more money, again without having gotten any better.

The TLDR version: salary structure is related to transfer fees, so Spurs cannot simply flash the cash without it causing future consequences down the road for which they have no good answers.",null,0,null,1440426770,null,null,false,0,cudwokx,null,t3_3i6y2j,null,null,null,t1_cudtkjb,null,null,null,1441440393,null,1,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

when it became apparent that he was on his bike, the players reacted by sulking their way through the second half of the season, only occasionally turning up for a few glamour fixtures. 

anyone who saw the end of season lap of appreciation will see where the lads loyalties were. showing honest punters who were paying the best part of a grand a year to watch them earn a year's wage in a week how much they meant by huddling around the large one as they were frog marched around the centre spot like they were on their way to a firing squad.

so in comes the new bloke, he's not there to be their mate or make excuses and actually sets down expectations for playing decent football. suddenly the lads who haven't been pushed for three years are suddenly being told that they aren't as good as they thought (apparently dicksy said that ""some of these players aren't nearly as good as they think they are"") and they have the choice of swallowing it down and pulling their socks up, or going into a mard, moaning to their agent, their old mate sam and each other about how it wasn't this way under his largeness.",null,0,null,1440428521,null,null,1440428885,0,cudxoam,null,t3_3i7757,null,null,null,t1_cudw2fy,null,null,null,1441440860,null,7,null,Hammers,t5_2sco3,7,null

Besides, Pogba is very much a Yaya Toure type player who I think would contribute far more on defense than the Ivorian. With this in mind, he would really round out our midfield. Imagine a paring of Pogba and Matic teaming up, this could potentially mask the defensive deficiencies of Fabregas.

It's also becoming increasingly common, from what I've seen, to have a minor injuries unit or urgent care centre attached to/next to A&amp;E, so that patients are sent into the appropriate one on arrival, which will reduce waiting times and clogging up of beds for those who do need the emergency unit.

A. he should have never been purchased if Rodgers didn't believe he fit our game plan - which he doesn't bc we haven't played with two forwards and god knows how long. Not blaming rodgers or the transfer committee, but clearly it was a bad move if we weren't gonna use him correctly. Waste of money and waste of time for all parties. 

B. The way he has been handled this year has been shameful. Clearly Rodgers wants him gone, but what kind of message does that send to potential incoming players? I have never heard of big teams doing something like this just to get a player out of their squad. Rodgers has again and again shown poor man management skills. 

C. Balo did not do himself any favors. I still like him and believe it could have worked, but clearly it wasn't meant to be. His style of play does not fit BR's style, and he was always going to end up on the losing end. Our team was really struggling last year and it was always going to be tough. Had sturridge been healthy him and balo could have potentially worked up top together. BR going with a single striker ended any chance of him doing well. 

I dont like when people say he didn't give his all when he was on the pitch simply bc he's not a maniac chasing the ball around, he just has a completely different style of play. I feel for him bc I dont think Milan is a good fit either, they just purchased two forwards for quite a bit of money, he'll be on the outside looking in there as well. Hope it all works out.

I will say Lamela's biggest weakness is he doesn't seem to understand situations in which it's imperative he doesn't give the ball away. His one bad pass cost Dier a yellow card (a smart booking to take by Dier, fwiw). And I think it's one reason Lamela gets so much grief -- his mistakes tend to be more noticeable because he's making them in such dangerous areas.

That said, I don't think this was the right time to play him (though hindsight is 20/20).

null,null,Arctic_Fax,null,null,null,"&gt;There isn't much value compared to other countries.

Definitely, also the attitude in the US to healthcare is different to in the UK, like people expect that if they go to the doctor they will come away with some medication, because ultimately they're paying a lot of money for this stuff! In the UK they'll just tell you to go home unless you actually need something. The NHS generally adheres to [NICE guidelines](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance) they're basically clinical trial/peer review backed guidelines which weigh up the cost of various treatments against the chance of success/potential impact/importance to the population as a whole.

Its basically the way all government spending / policy should work imo, and its basically the thing that governs how good the NHS is at supplying treatment.

In the US I found the guidelines seemed to be ""throw everything at it"", that's fine and it makes patients feel like they're getting lots of stuff, but it makes things expensive (insurance companies like that) and also actually wastes a lot of time. 

A lot of people in the UK like to feel all superior about how much better the NHS is than the US system, and I do think it is a better system, but the treatment that a patient receives is probably a bit below what you get in the US. *However* the NHS receives far far less funding, and you always have the option of going private and skipping all the queues anyway, and private insurance in the UK isn't a whole lot more than it is in the US to be honest, and you get all the benefits of the NHS on top!

The US system is just extremely wasteful for the taxpayer....but extremely good for insurance company profits.",null,0,null,1440431416,null,null,false,0,cudzfdu,null,t3_3i5bva,null,null,null,t1_cudx74u,null,null,null,1441441686,null,3,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

I've had to go to the urgent care at my local hospital twice here, have been seen within 2-3 hours for relatively minor injuries that couldn't wait for a 10 day later GP appointment. For a similar case where I had to take my younger sister to A&amp;E in Dublin after she cracked a bone in her hand during a football match, we were 8 hours in A&amp;E before anyone could see us because she was unfortunate enough to get injured at 3pm on a Saturday. Wait times to see certain consultants and have certain procedures back home can be in the range of years on the public system, it's not quite as bad in the UK!

Contraception is free and my GP practice tries to encourage the use of LARCs, which is good to see but they were happy to prescribe me a low dose combined pill when I simply wanted to prevent for another year before trying for a baby. Maternity care is free on both sides, but Irish hospitals are seriously cheaping out on scans these days - I've heard cases of women at certain hospitals only getting a 12 week scan, no 20 week anomaly scan because of a combination of cost and Ireland's fucked up abortion laws. I'm currently 10 weeks pregnant and so, so happy I live in the UK these days.

Prescriptions tend to work out relatively good value - my parents (one is a two time breast cancer survivor, one has a chronic bowel condition, both early-mid 50s) would pay about £40 a month in total for their medications if they lived in England, but end up paying more like €150 each in Ireland.

Last year he really struggled because we were slow going from defence to attack, and now we have pace, he's looking great. Been very dangerous in all 3 games. Also contributes greatly to our defensive solidarity.

However, it is impossible to overlook the fact he can't pick out a final ball or score at the moment. He had the easiest cross to put the ball on a plate for Aguero yesterday and fucked it up. Then he had a great goalscoring chance and passed when he should have shot.

He was never prolific in front of goal, but he used to score fairly regularly and came up with loads of killer crosses. The 18 month goal drought has destroyed his confidence in the box, and when he gets so many opportunities he should be getting at least 10 goals a season - he should already have a couple.

I really like him but he needs to find some shooting boots (BTW he actually changed boot sponsors from Nike to New Balance and that's when he stopped scoring. Probably coincidence.) or he's going to get replaced. Well, he's going to get replaced anyway if we can get KDB, but he would be an incredible back up if he could just bloody score.

Ade is notoriously untrustworthy, and only shows his talent when he's fighting for something.  He's among the least professional footballers around, as he's shown again and again during his career - I'm pretty sure we can't put that on Pochettino.

Aside from that I consider the License fee to be a completely outdated means of providing public service broadcasting.  It's let the BBC grow into this huge cultural behemoth and understandably they're a bit desperate to maintain this position and easy funding.  We all know the license fee doesn't insulate the BBC from Government so they might as well just fund the essential stuff (news, weather, world service, emergency broadcaster stuff) from taxation and move everything else over to subscription.

null,null,Masterofknees,logo,,null,"Last season it was like he didn't have a plan B, he was always looking to use his burst of speed to get past his man and cross, and while that was sometimes fine he became a headless chicken when it didn't work. His crossing also doesn't bear much fruit when it's only Aguero who's up front. He's also really bad at scoring, yesterday was a good example of how he just can't put it in goal no matter how big the chance, might be a mental block or something but I think we're not too far away from reaching a year since he last scored, a winger really needs to put more in the net than he does. Also, his corner kicks are hilarious, they never amount to anything.

That was last season though, even as one of his harsher critics I'll happily admit that he's started off this season really well, he's mixing up his play more and isn't just relying on his pace or overlapping runs from the fullback, he's playing it into the midfield much more than usually and isn't just looking for any opportunity to cross it into the box. Basically it seems like he's just been given new instructions by Pellegrini, I think since the initial plan was to run 4-4-2 last season they were depending on someone like Dzeko to bang his crosses into the net, but since that formation didn't work we switched to the 4-2-3-1 halfway through, something which didn't suit Navas' playstyle at the time, and therefore he didn't produce as well. 

Since it seems he's now being used properly though I'm pretty optimistic about his role this season, even if De Bruyne arrives he'll be a fantastic option to have on the bench and as rotation, especially in games where we might need to be more defensive as he's really good at tracking back.",null,0,null,1440432747,null,null,1440432981,0,cue09ja,null,t3_3i7qp3,null,null,null,t3_3i7qp3,null,null,null,1441442081,null,2,null,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2,null

Overall I like Jesus Navas. It's easy to overlook a player like him when you have Aguero, Silva, Kompany etc on your team. I think maybe that's why he's not as talked about as the others.

Safety is important to me, as is reliability and relative longevity, so that gives me a lot to think about. I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty when it comes to maintenance and like to think I take good care of my things, and am also pretty solid on two wheels after 30 odd years of cycling/mountain biking and 5-ish years of moped riding, so I hope I would be able to keep the thing in decent condition and not knock it about too much, but hearing about failures like the one mentioned by BelfastBikerDave - that is not cool and that concerns me.  Makes complete sense what you say about being built to a budget. I'm not too worried about the depreciation that much if i'm going to get a couple of good years out of a bike I like, and I do like the look of this bike, which is mainly what got me interested in it. But I guess there's no point having a bike that looks good but is falling apart from day one. I have spent months on ebay and gumtree looking at used bikes and have been a bit reluctant to go down that route because often the bikes I like are nowhere near where I live and just generally am a bit uncertain about purchasing from someone who could be pulling the wool over my eyes. I suppose I don't even want to have to consider that I need to check a bike I want might be stolen.

Really, I started this thread hoping that somebody would whip out some link that would settle the question entirely-- some article saying that he had an MRI at a young age confirming his age, or that his birth was well documented.

Failing that I'm just raising it as a slight risk and something to keep an eye on.

I may be overly sensitive to this issue as a fan of US baseball-- baseball had a *major* rash of age fraud among dominican players before teams really started to take the risk seriously. It's worth noting that prior to the issue of dominican age fraud entering the public consciousness, it does seem like US baseball teams weren't as diligent and skeptical as they should have been in assessing a player's age.

Again though, the fact that Berahino came to the UK at a relatively young age does make the risk pretty small.

The budget did include some tax rises, such as on car insurance. Now yes, you could tax income more. The most obvious choice is to tax the wealthy more by reintroducing the 50p tax rate. However a lot of economists thought that such a high top rate tax was [damaging the UK economy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14810323). Now of course, you can probably find economists which support a 50p tax but I'm just demonstrating that it isn't as simple as simply raising taxes as there are drawbacks to doing that. And anyway, the tax wasn't generating even nearly enough revenue to get anywhere close to wiping the deficit. You could of course raise taxes for lower/middle incomes but that would almost definitely damage consume spending considerably.

Assuming your tent isn't damaged, you put it up badly. This happens a lot, unfortunately. People think it looks easy, and are then miserable because they have absolutely no idea what the hell they're actually doing. They then pronounce camping shit.

My dad used to spot first timers a mile off and grab whichever one of us was nearest to go and teach them how to do it properly. Once he decided a tent was so badly put up he took it all down and started again. Most common mistake: not spreading the guy ropes out far enough.

Holding off could possibly save you money but is more likely to lose you money in the long run especially since you already have the deposit and house you want.

He has a much better chance of dominating his level of youth football and of standing out.  He has a much better chance of being picked up by a good football academy. The benefit is even *larger* at a younger age than at an older age.

* Excellent healthcare is available for those who can afford it
* There are lots of doctors and specialists available in certain parts of the country
* Facilities are well equipped with technology
* Waiting lists are short or non-existent
* Everyone pays lower taxes

*Anti US System*

* Many people, including the poorest in society, have no access to healthcare at all
* It is an extremely inefficient system, with up to 24% of the total spent on administration costs 
* Facilities tend to be located in areas with people with the most means rather than on a needs basis
* There is a potential to encourage 'over ordering' of tests that may not be considered a medical necessity
* It leads to fragmentation. Health services for poor and marginalized groups are often highly fragmented and severely under-resourced
* Health outcomes are worse in the US than other developed nations despite having the highest per capita costs in the world

In a comparison with ten other developed countries by *The Commonwealth Fund*, the UK's National Health Service was ranked first overall and first in quality care, access and efficiency.  The US was ranked last.

Parking on the other hand is the never ending struggle that will hone your character as a London biker. I struggled with this for years as well and, from my experience, options include...

-Renting a garage. Last I checked that will run you £150 - £300 per month, depending on where you live. If you've got that kind of scratch to spend on parking your bike though it might be time to upgrade your ride : ) 

-I lived in a place for a few years that had a front garden with just enough room to park a bike on the walkway and leave room for people to walk by. I surreptitiously sunk a ground anchor into the concrete path and locked my bike to that. Lots of houses in London have similar little nooks and crannies. 

-A lot of new build apartment buildings come with secure underground parking with space for bikes. I've got a mate who lives in one near Seven Sisters, I think he pays an extra £35/month for a spot in a bike bay. 

-Live outside of the centre. The further you get out of central London, the more places you'll find with off street and secure parking.

The Turkish Lig is NOT a step down from Scotland, and is far the podunk, useless league in Europe that would be comparable to somewhere like Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, or maybe even Ukraine. 

I understand that most of us only see one or two teams in Europe, but that does not speak to the quality of the league. There are three big teams - Galatasaray, Fenerbahce, and Besiktas, but there are maybe three or four very good and growing clubs as well. Trabzonspor and Bursaspor might be names you know as well (Bursa being where Enes Unal was bought from).

This league is full of skilled stars, and each club has a few names you'll know. Denayer will not be facing useless talent week-in and week-in, and will be facing better than he did in Scotland. Add in a team with higher CL aspirations than the group stage, and you've got a good situation for him. The atmosphere's are difficult, there's loads of travel, and most importantly Gala have first class facilities rivaled by few in Europe, let alone Turkey. 

This might not be a PL loan, but again we'll get a look at him in a good squad that plays in Europe. He likely had his choice of places, but I don't think Gala is any worse than a bottom half club in France or Germany.

There's no magic formula, no small trick increasing your chances. For example, I'm a languages student so my experience is nothing like that of, say, a computer scientist.

Assuming undergrad: there's a lot of advice on the admissions website and if you go to an open day there might be a mock interview to show you what it's like (it depends on the college. Different tutors interview differently so it's not always representative). 

Generally though, practice interviews if you can. It helps if your school can schedule mock interviews but you can also ask family friends, parents' colleagues, etc. (it's better with people you don't know too well). The point is not to be able to answer every question but to gain confidence and learn how to react when you don't know something. 

If taking a test is part of your subject's entrance requirements, prepare it too. Look at past papers. I don't know how important it is (I'm pretty sure I did terribly) but don't neglect it.

Finally, Oxbridge is not the be-all and end-all. Plenty of incredibly intelligent people get rejected every year and have a great time somewhere else. You've probably heard this already but it bears repeating.

null,null,wellthisisoutrageous,null,null,null,"That's a very orthodox take on a 4-4-2. There are plenty of sides across Europe employing variations of the formation, and I can't remember any that even uses traditional wingers. A lot of them have been very successful in recent years, too.

Just last season, Juventus reached the CL final setting up in a 4-4-2 diamond system, with Pirlo as a regista, Marchisio and Pogba as wide midfielders and Vidal as a 10. I'm not saying this is the way forward for us, as they usually sat deep and relied on counter-attacking through Tevez and Morata, which is somewhat antagonical to Poch's approach, but it would translate quite well to our squad.

The two Madrid sides are also excellent examples. Atlético usually deploy four midfielders in their formation, but unlike Juve they still rely on a double pivot (Tiago - Gabi, usually) with two wide midfielders tucked in tight (Turan and Koke, most of the time).  As for Real, Ancelotti's system was often much more of a 4-4-2 (or 4-2-2-2, which had already been his favoured formation at PSG) than a 4-3-3. When Bale was out injured, he'd often use James and Isco behind Ronaldo and Benzema and ahead of a midfield pairing of Modric - Kroos, or Ramos - Kroos. He'd already done this the previous season ([here's](http://i.imgur.com/Gx5NIEn.png) a screenshot from the 2014 CL final), while every pundit was referring to it as a 4-3-3. 

Jorge Jesus's Benfica was probably my favourite side in Europe a couple of seasons ago. I was at the Lane when they beat us and I left the ground wondering if I would ever see us play such thrilling football. Again, 4-4-2, and one that would be easy to implement with the squad we've got - a right winger, a 10 playing on the left and drifting inside, a classic centre-forward supported by an aggressive second-striker, a physical double pivot, attacking full-backs. 

On the whole, I understand where you're coming from, but your post reads a bit like a collection of common myths and misconceptions regarding football tactics. There's not a Manichean division between Cruyff's 4-3-3 and Sven Goran Eriksson's much-maligned 4-4-2. Wide players don't need to be traditional wingers. We're not ""built for three central mids"", we've been playing a double pivot for years now. Eriksen played in a midfield three for Ajax, but he's a classic 10 for us - his lack of defensive work is a tactical option, etc etc.
