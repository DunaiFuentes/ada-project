I am not going to respond to this it is simply ludicrous, you may as well stick your head in the sand.

&gt; ive seen fiana gail and the southern parties they have all the issues of Westminsters party

I'd agree with you there to an extent, however, the Politicial winds are in the south are moving to the Left , the same can not be said for the UK which is currently shifting further to the Right.

&gt; I still don't trust the euro if nations like greece have a bad time.....

I'll be gentle here, i don't think you understand the issue at hand, i think you should do more reading on it. Greece's problems are not simply Currency problems they are a lot more complex than that.
 
&gt; ....and it affects me why should I take it?

This is a bizarre form of NIMBYism, you do realise that economic problems anywhere in the world can affect you regardless of Currency. 
 
&gt; The pound may have issues but I know for a fact the currency is more desirable why would the snp a independence party prefer it over the euro they pushed strongly for the pound and I am with them on that..I would ask that northern ireland keep the pound if reunification happened.

The Problem with an Independent Scotland and the Pound, relate to it being an entirely new state.  In terms of it's importance in the debate it was vastly overplayed, the truth of the matter is that the Pound relies heavily on an equally strong Euro, otherwise it has huge difficulties exporting to its [largest customer the Eurozone](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/comment/article-2893696/HUGO-DUNCAN-Roller-coaster-ride-ahead-sterling-2015-turbulent-two-years-pound-suffer-no-party-wins-majority-general-election.html
) and it is no stranger to wild fluctuations.

&gt; You haven't answered my querie on why the citizens of the south should subsidise us when we can offer nothing in return the effects of the reunification of east Germany to west is still being felt in Germany why should a significantly smaller country take on our debt? We drag down the uk god knows how badly we would drag down the republic.

Northern Ireland has not been a Net contributor to the UK since the 1940's, it had only really been Economically viable for around eight or nine years of its early existence. The reason for such a heavily subsidised economy has largely about keeping the place intact, it is an entirely false economy kept in the shadow of the uk, if anything it is an afterthought. The general consensus from Economists is that this Current form of subsidisation will end otherwise NI will remain forever as an economic backwater , this is happening regardless of Re-unification. It is already being felt with up to a third of public sector jobs under threat, nevermind the rest of the cuts that are planned.

&gt; And answer to me is the south prepared for the troubles round 2 because as I said the ruc and British army couldn't handle it and the south will most likely experience the same thing only with the loyalists wanting reunification with the uk do the citizens deserve it?

There will be NO troubles 2.0 and here is why, if the decision is made it will be democratic, unlike the formation of NI. It will not deny rights to loyalists in fact it will more than likely embrace them. It will be transitional, meaning it will take quite a bit of time. It won't be the end of the world.

I understand greece has a range of issues but there mishandling of the euro affected the other member states to the point certain members considered dropping it.

The euro I just don't trust sure everything can affect an economy but when my currency is linked to say any another country whos actions could hurt me I would be incredibly cautious of having it as my currency

Shed lower behind the goal is pretty similar to MHL but not quite as good IMO.

If not then where would you propose the first route should be, it seems hard to argue that it shouldn't connect to the UK's capital and largest city. And I'm pretty sure most other countries started their systems by connecting to their largest cities or capital.

If so, do you not recognise the significant capacity issues facing many rail lines, in particular the west coast main line. Upgrading that line would be very expensive and very disruptive while not as effective as a new line, and if you're building a new line it would be totally short sighted to make it not high speed.

I also don't understand where your reasoning comes from for the government's Machiavellian plan to make the whole country into London commuter towns. For example if property prices continue to rise so disproportionately it could encourage the opposite of what you describe with companies setting up outside London knowing staff can still quickly travel there for other meetings or whatever.

Which is good and i'm the same, but it seems like your dismissing the Greens because of a lack of information, yet you consider the other parties valid options while lacking that same information from them. Who are you voting for currently? The way i see it, its either the greens or a labour vote because the tories are assholes.

&gt; If the UK isn't in debt, then it has surplus money which can be used on well whatever a Government decides to use it. The longer the debt drags on, the more interest is put on and therefore the worse the credit rating goes. This then makes it harder it is for the UK to borrow and makes the UK a less attractive place for business. This then causes many economic issues, which as we have seen throughout history and in the modern world it can have serious consequences. Examples. 1, 2, 3. Who all threaten to not only leave the EU, but ensure it fails.

Who do you think we are in debt to? Our debt is financed by issuing government securities (gilts), then auctioned to various UK investors, building societies, pension funds, banks, ect. Gilts pay the holder a fixed amount of interest every six months until maturity, at which point the holder receives the final payment; the original amount the gilt was issued for.  
This is where our debt comes from, meaning the debt doesn't ""drag on"" and accumulate interest. Owners are paid a fixed bi-yearly sum and they last however long they last (average is 15 years). The problem is we've issued too many gilts and wasn't able to tax enough to pay them back, so decided to issue even more gilts to pay back the previous ones, creating a cycle of never ending debt. But that is a different matter.

[This](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/holdings-gilts-sector.png) shows who owns UK gilts. As you can see, the UK private sector owns most of the debt, 30% of it being undisclosed foreign investors.

25% of gilts have been bought by the Bank of England, which is owned by our Treasury. The BoE bought those gilts by creating £300+ billion from nothing, (because on-screen numbers don't mean anything) and are now gaining the interest on them! [The Treasury is effectively paying interest to itself on assets that it bought with “free” printed money.](https://www.bondvigilantes.com/blog/2012/04/11/if-the-government-simply-cancelled-the-300-bn-of-qe-gilts-held-by-the-boe-who-would-be-unhappy/) 

This is the kind of ridiculous, abstract situation I'm talking about when i say it doesn't really matter. We are effectively borrowing money from ourselves, then getting worried that we won't be able to pay ourselves back. Who cares if we are less attractive to business? We are currently surrounded by the stuff, with London at the centre sucking up all the ""recovery"" money and all they do is destroy the planet in a one-sighted lust for profit while avoiding as much tax as possible. Businesses doesn't create jobs, consumer demand does.

I didn't really understand your examples of consequences, btw. The only consequence I saw was that the National Front became economically protectionist, which was a result of the party. That isn't the economy doing anything. The economy isn't real, its just a concept. Plus, because we are separate from the Eurozone and have our own central bank and currency, your examples might not apply here. 

I'll also add that fixing the broken taxation system would replace much of the need for all this borrowing in the first place. And that was a really small part of my previous comment that I just spent far too much time on clearing up! Haha

&gt; It sounds great yes, but in reality, the efforts as I said would be futile, Russia and China are still going to churn out tons of fossil fuels, so until we change every nations minds on climate change, the world will get worse. The Environment is a world issue, the world needs to work together.

Again, do you suggest we continue supporting (not just supporting in fact, increasing our reliance on) unnecessary and world destabilising fossil fuels just because Russia and China won't stop? Doesn't that sound a bit childish? It would be better to start now and lead by example, giving us leverage on the ""global emission negotiation table"" whenever that might happen. Putting it off won't help at all, but a UK/Europe reduction will, regardless of how small.

&gt; If Eco-tech companies want their ideas to become policies, then they need to lobby harder and get in with the right MPs and Lords to actually succeed. That's how lobbying works, some are successful, some aren't.

Sure, but it shouldn't work like that and it doesn't have to. You must know its not that simple, the system is corrupt and money in politics is openly everywhere. 

&gt; I would want to know what type of renewable energy would be used, and how much will it cost. 

The type doesn't matter, although i imagine the most cost-effective and efficient renewable would be the best choice. [Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58YuHcIv1LQ) for an idea of the potential that is being wasted. 
Cost doesn't matter either, it would be an investment for a self-sustaining future and as i highlighted above, the money is there. Its just going to the wrong place. 

&gt; Ideas have to be put under scrutiny to have credibility.

Sure, but then you need to investigate that yourself. Don't just ask questions, go find some answers.

&gt;Where will we put the new houses, without making everything cramped for everyone. There are a lot of people and limited space.

Again, not something I know. [I did just find this though](http://www.shelter.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/802270/Building_the_homes_we_need_-_a_programme_for_the_2015_government.pdf) which seems like a great, in-depth source explaining what needs to be done and how it could be done. From my very quick read, I found that the UK has 87.5% Green space. 8.5% Urban with 1.1% of that being peoples homes. So space isn't at all as limited as you believe. 

In the end though, its like your saying because there is a chance it can't be done, you would rather vote for the proven corrupt parties who have been taking turns at being in power forever, who are quite happy to refuse to even try because the poor don't/can't lobby for houses.

&gt; I am not easily swayed by promises and buzzwords. So I would need questions answered in detail before I would make a decision on any party. I am not wasting my first vote.

Promises and buzzwords are all there is in politics. You won't get answers just by asking questions. Your first vote won't be anymore important than your last if the system doesn't change.

Northern Ireland is the [Economic Basket Case](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/northern-ireland-is-the-lame-duck-of-the-uk-29669915.html) and has been for some time. Being Part of the UK has had a [deeply negative](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/over-a-quarter-of-northern-ireland-workers-paid-less-than-the-living-wage-29730081.html) impact on the economy on this part of the island. Borders in general have negative economic impacts, but it has been disastrous for this island.

&gt; A product of the balance of coercion between Britain and nationalist Ireland in 1920,
&gt; the partition of Ireland installed an erratic and meandering international boundary of
&gt; 450km, cross-cutting 1400 agricultural holdings and 180 roads, and bisecting villages and even some individual houses ...  (O’Dowd et al., 1995: 274). 
 
&gt; From a more economic perspective, the Irish border shares many of the characteristics which Mitko et al. (2003) suggests are typical of other border or frontier regions, and which may be contributing to their underdevelopment. For example,Mitko et al. (2003: 21) cite low population densities in border areas in Southeastern Europe which, it has been argued, may lead to a lack of agglomeration economies and a reduction in the scope for local cooperation
&gt;  and learning (Petrakos and Tsiapa, 2001). ^[Source](http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/CentreforInternationalBordersResearch/Publications/WorkingPapers/MappingFrontiersworkingpapers/Filetoupload,175403,en.pdf)

If you need a stark image to realise the negative impact on Infrastructure and it's subsequent effects on both sides of the border take a look at this [image](http://www.discoveringireland.com/images/stories/Ireland/train_routes.jpg) this covers the railway network, but could be taken as an indicator as to the serious underdevelopment of all areas of the economy, never mind the doubling up and replication of services due to having two separate states on this tiny Island. Partition quite simply is bad for the Economy.

The untold story of the peace process, is that cross border co-operation has been its greatest success story, every effort has been to minimise the effect of the border.

&gt; There is now general agreement that inter-firm cooperation through networks, partnerships and supply-chains can, by facilitating knowledge exchange and reducing
&gt; transaction costs, contribute both to innovation and company competitiveness (Oerlemans et al, 1998). Dense patterns of “association’, alongside links between firms and other support institutions, have also been linked to cluster and regional growth(Cooke and Morgan, 1998). Case-studies of areas with high levels of such inter-organisational cooperation have generally also been characterised by social and economic uniformity, geographical contiguity, high levels of social capital (including, in particular, trust), and stable and supportive governance and support institutions (Braczyk et al., 1998). **Border regions are often characterised by exactly the opposite conditions: economic discontinuity, low levels of social capital, and governance which is at best divided, and at worst, antagonistic (Mitko et al., 2003). The result can be both a lack of knowledge sharing, diffusion and organisational learning (Petrakos and Tsiapa, 2001), and disproportionately
&gt; low levels of trade. In this context, cross-border cooperation can play an important role, countering the structural discontinuity of border regions and generating a potentially positive growth dynamic**. ^[Source](http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/CentreforInternationalBordersResearch/Publications/WorkingPapers/MappingFrontiersworkingpapers/Filetoupload,175403,en.pdf)

There is a trend in this Sub to spout overly simplified economic arguments ""such as NI needs 11Bn to be supported, the South doesn't have it"" it is indicative of a complete lack understanding of economics. First of all,  no one asks what led to the situation where we have to be spoon fed, why are we so reliant on subsidies, why is the economy stagnant? It has little to do with the troubles because Northern Ireland has not been a Net Contributor to the UK since the 1930's.

&gt; The weakness of the Northern Ireland economy became apparent in the 1930s, with its reliance on traditional industries which went into decline during the decade. Economic decline, halted only by the Second World War, put strain on Northern Ireland's social structure. ^[Source](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/sectarian/brewer.htm)

The reality is that Northern Ireland was only really Economically Viable for about 8 or 9 years of its existence with mild reprieve during WW2, Creating an artificial state on this island was a dreadful mistake economically. The only saving grace was the [Welfare State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c86Gwsb5LY). 
If you have not been paying attention it is under attack. At the moment a free trade Agreement is being Negotiated; EU/US Free Trade Agreement (or TTIP). It will have a devastating impact on public services. The minimal advantages of being Part of the UK, such as the NHS, [won't exist](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/privatisation-agenda-drives-tory-policy-on-nhs-says-andy-burnham-9052640.html) in the near future. 

&gt; The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership The European Commission (EC) is currently involved in negotiating an FTA of unprecedented scale between the US and European Union (EU). This is the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (or TTIP). The initial aim was to conclude negotiations at great speed (or ‘on one tank of gas’) by November 2014. It now seems that towards the end of 2015 is more realistic.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to reducing tariffs and increasing protection for transnational investors, TTIP also aims to remove (or ‘harmonise’) regulatory barriers that restrict profitable trade between the US and EU.  These ‘barriers’ are often our most prized and hard-won regulations and standards that protect, for example, our labour rights, environment, food safety, digital privacy, and banking standards.^[Source](http://www.patients4nhs.org.uk/eu-us-free-trade-agreement-or-ttip/)

The advantages of being in the UK are being swept away, the Economic arguments for the state of Northern Ireland are paper thin (and on the verge of being torn to shreds). There are real economic advantages to an All Ireland state that have yet to be tapped. The trend of business is already seeking greater co-operation north and south, it is time for the institutions to follow suit.

The woman interviewed was born in Israel to Polish parents fleeing Europe after the war, she says she has only been French on paper for one month after living there for twenty years. In context his comments seem to me a little less outrageous. On balance he is no more patronising towards her than toward the fellow from a Muslim family (which is to say very patronising indeed - the bit about depictions of the prophet is cringe worthy) .

Yet the topic at hand is the climate in France for Muslims and Jews; his introduction of the topic of Palestine is sudden and clunky. He interrupts her twice in doing so. That eagerness to bring the conversation around to Palestine makes me uneasy. Antisemitism is a real concern in France, and one which is rising - something Willcox himself refers to in the interview. Is this the proper reaction to bigotry towards Jews, to simply say ""but what about Palestine?"".

I don't have a particular dislike of high-speed rail.

They've just announced they're going to dual another few miles of it, but it's one of the most vital roads in the east coast of britain...but because it's further north than the wash, it's left for decades...

How about complete electrification of all major lines, re-nationalising the railways, with control given to a not-for-profit government-owned company (similar to how ferries run here)?
Then maybe reopen some of the dozens of rural train stations closed in the '60's to help increase rural usage of railway, instead of the constant use of cars...helping to reverse decades of countryside-flight as younger people are forced to flee to towns and cities, leaving their village homes sweet-picking for holiday-home investors who are quite happy to devastate rural communities in the search of a quick bob?

Instead, billions will be wasted on a trainline that serves only one nation out of four, and only truly benefits maybe 10% of the population of said nation...

Or go to FAQ for the subreddit for a compilation of lists. You'll find that Classic Who had more multi-episode story arcs while New Who has more single episode stories.

Watching Classic Who will give you a lot of the backstory, and you can see themes and nods from the Classic Who that appear in many of the New Who episodes. You will also get to see acting without CGI, sometimes campy monsters, and occasional wobbly sets. Even if you just watch the highlights of each season/series, or each Doctor, you will still get a good introduction to the show's history. Enjoy.

Rather than use a prosthetic they, for some reason, opted to make Skaldak's face completely CGI. Pretty much every scene in which you see his face and see him talking is the [exact same frame at the same angle in a completely static shot.](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130414012414/tardis/images/4/46/Skaldak.jpg) When I first watched it, I was taken completely out of the experience by this. When you compare the way the shot of Skaldak's face is to the rest of the scene it looks so out of place and feels so un-natural. What almost makes it worse is that they try to hide the fact that it's a completely static shot by moving the frame around slightly in a way that is completely different to the way the cameras in the rest of the shots move. 

It completely ruined the whole episode for me. If they weren't going to use a prosthetic or didn't have the budget for a CGI shot of him in motion then they should have just left his helmet on.

Ahh, apologises. That wasn't my intention, which is why I asked who you were voting for. Although it wouldn't have been an unthinkable leap to assume you would have some idea of who you support, since your on the BritishPolitics subreddit and you said you didn't want to waste your first vote.

Like i said before, I actually think its all bullshit. I'm just discussing my opinion of the ""choices"" within the system because that is sadly all we currently have.

&gt; I'd vote on what I know and who I could trust. 

You can't trust any of them. A big factor in my liking of the greens is not only their policies, but that they haven't yet had a chance to prove they are untrustworthy, unlike the other parties.

&gt; I'm not dismissing your arguments at all. I'm just still not convinced.

Is there anything that I did convince you on? Just out of interest.

&gt; I also am a Eurosceptic, so voting for a pro-EU party would make no sense.

So am i. I think devolution of power would help reduce corruption, but I also think, like immigration, there are much more important issues that don't get constant media coverage.

Standard procedure. Why did they take so long?

Seriously, this is a very brave move on Kraft's part. They are selling in the USA to the niche market who don't like Hershey's chocolate on the very reasonable grounds that it is almost indistinguishable in taste from vomit. The American palette is different.

There's a large minority who prefer the British style (richer, creamier, smoother, less mysterious random chunks of carrot), and they will buy Creme Eggs in droves. But Kraft changed it based on a blind tasting, according to the article.

Blind tasting tells you what consumers think taste better, not *what they will buy*. 

So what they've done is to move away from their successful niche market so that they can compete with household names that Americans are loyal to already. Will it work out? Maybe. The filling is delicious and wrapping it in bad chocolate won't change that. They *may* be successful. But why on earth didn't they keep their successful brand and issue a special version like Coke did with ""cherry coke""? They could have called it ""Creme egg: vomitchoc edition"" or something.

Instead, the commuters drive on completely inadequate roads, causing horrendous traffic.

null,false,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,null,"I kind of feel for Lambert tbh. When I said last season that we needed to keep playing on the counter (like we did under O'Neill, even) because it utilises our strengths (pace on the break, and the fact that we don't really have a creative link player), people complained and said the tactics were shit and I was blind to Lambert's tactical ineptitude (the 1-0 loss to Crystal Palace in particular comes to mind).

Now he's changed it up and tried to make the football nicer to watch, and we are generally dominating in midfield and are much harder to score against... and people are still complaining because we don't score enough goals (citing the exact same reasoning I did for playing the boring, defensive counterattacking style; a lack of a creative player to unlock defences).

He's currently trying to address the problems in the transfer window, by signing a couple of decent attacking players, the type we've been lacking recently, so we CAN score more goals... and people are still complaining.

It's like no matter what he does at this point, he just can't get a break. I feel like he could get us to Wembley via a series of tactical victories and people would still want him out because it would be seen as a fluke. And it's not even like it's entirely his fault we're struggling. It's clearly not a case of ""he's set them up in a shit system"" because he has tried practically every system Villa can feasibly use and none have really worked. It's not a case of ""he's signing the wrong players"" because who else could he realistically have gotten on the budget he's been allowed? When he has money to spend, he generally spends it well. I really don't get what more people want from him. People seem to be criticising him for strange things. First it was for ""not listening to the fans"" now it's for doing exactly what they asked him to do before.

Yeah, I get that we, the fans, are frustrated and whatnot... worried, even... but seriously? Booting Lambert most likely won't change that.

Even the complaints about Randy Lerner make no sense. What money is he supposed to spend if we're to conform to FFP and avoid fines and sanctions and whatnot? We simply don't have that kind of revenue right now, and with crowds shrinking, it's only going to get harder. I assume this is why Tom Fox was brought in -- to boost our financial clout, and allow us to actually improve the squad under a sustainable financial model. But this stuff takes time.

I'm not even mad at people complaining. I get it. I just don't see what else the club could realistically be doing, and frankly, I'm kind of thankful that Lambert hasn't just done an O'Neill and fucked off because he's mad at the restrictions he has to work under, leaving us even further up shit creek than we already appear to be. Or that Lerner hasn't just said ""fuck it"" and sold the club at a huge loss to some dodgy Singaporean at a cut price, just to get the fuck out of here.

Where did the Imam get the money from? Here is an interview with an ex-Jihadi who explains their funding system http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04wwqcp - skip to the 15minute mark for the funding part.

The term he uses is called ""Tajheez al-Ghazi"". But I think there are a variety of spellings because I can't find many hits on this.

* Footballers are not robots.
* Our success last season was a blessing and a curse.
* I personally felt that this season was always going to be more of a transitional season rather than one where we repeat the success of last season.

Yes, the talents of our summer signings were certainly heralded over the summer with all of the highlight videos that were uploaded. But footballers are not robots. They are human beings - young ones at that - who have moved to a new club, a new city, and in most cases have to learn a new language. Combine all that with the pressure of a big club like Liverpool and the pressure and expectation to succeed. It is a difficult transition especially for young players.

Combine that with the fact that we exceeded expectations last season and almost won the title.

Now recognise the fact that we have lost the two top goal-scorers from last season. One permanently, the other due to injury.

While we all hoped that we'd catch a bit of lightning in a bottle with Balotelli, Lallana, Lambert, etc., unfortunately, that simply did not happen and that was magnified with Sturridge's lengthy injury as well.

I agree, maybe Rodgers should have - in hindsight - made better decisions in the transfer window. Maybe he should have adjusted his tactics and formation much earlier. Maybe.

But I think we're finally getting it right and I think all of our young, talented transfers are starting to come good.

This is exactly what we need.  Suarez used to menace defenders like this.  Sterling still does and Lallana has looked lively but we've lost a lot of that intensity we had last year.  Once reason is because we were being caught on the break and had to shore up the rear guard but if we play Lucas, Henderson and Gerrard, we should be able to have a front three that press constantly.

For me, this is where Coutinho lacks.  A wonderful player when we're dominating a game but he can't take the game to a team like we need.

The thing is that with a car most people cannot afford to pass their test and jump into anything with near the power to weight ratio of some of the super bikes out there. Therefore the easiest thing to do is to stop them riding high powered machines. Rather than doing something like working with race tracks to get young people familiarised with and give them respect for powerful machines teach them to corner properly with a heavier machine and so on. 

The thing is though we've had the two year restriction thing for a long time, it just worked differently and I suppose it allowed people like me to turn up with our 125cc machine, having taught ourselves post CBT and pass a test with no training, then I got a restricted 500 for two years then I got a 600 and I've had a fair few bikes with the current one being a blade.

It is thought, wrongly, that by giving *c*s a new name, *n1*, say, they will no longer attract the opprobrium attached to *n*. This is true initially, but only initially. In the fullness of time, the opprobrium directed towards *c*s comes to attach to *n1*. It is therefore necessary to scorn all those using *n1* as instruments of the dark forces of all that is evil, predatory, inhuman, and inimical to peace, justice and tranquility. 

Instead, we must now denote *c*s with new name *n2*. And so the cycle begins again. To break it, we need to remove the opprobrium from what is denoted. No amount of re-notation will change what is denoted, or ultimately, what value is attached to it.

I would have taken that all day long. The recent away games I've been disappointed with have been Everton (when you realise how poor they've been this season) and Burnley. The Everton game you've just got to forget about, we lost to 3 rubbish, deflected goals, there's nothing you can do. The Burnley game I can't help but feel there was a psychological aspect to, fair enough. But you've got to bear in mind that the teams we've played away are either going to be finishing in the top 10 or were on great runs of form, or both. It's a point that's been said over and over again but that doesn't mean it's any less relevant. And we have come close to getting results on several occasions. No, it's not good enough, but we have improved considerably from the start of the season.

Vargas has not been replaced. I've got no qualms about Zamora starting up front with Austin. Before Zamora hit his bad patch it was very effective. With regards Harry's transfers this season the only bad ones that come to mind are Ferdinand and Mutch. I think Harry is unfairly criticized with his signings; everybody loves to point to the one player that hasn't worked out rather than the 2 that have. If anything, I think our form right now is down to the fact that players like Caulker, Dunne, Barton, Zamora and Henry haven't been performing to the standards they set during our run of home games.

We need another loan or two. I think we need to get somebody in at the back and maybe look at another winger/striker. I can see Harry looking for two more players. I'm not sure what I can say with regards your point about Fernandes though. After how long he put up with Hughes last time round I'm no longer encouraged by what he says on twitter but at the same time considering everything he's had to put up with with his Airline I think he has more pressing matters to deal with than our loss to Burnley and rightly so.

I'm as disappointed as you are with the result, but there are 8 teams down at the bottom and it is too early to expect us to be running away from relegation into midtable.

This is why it's combined with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation - you are pumping blood through the lungs to attempt to keep oxygen flowing to the casualty's organs.

CPR by itself has a &lt; 5% success rate, last time I looked at the statistics, and the side-effects are pretty horrific (multiple broken ribs, vomitting etc) but if it's that or the reaper, you do what you can.

This is why there are defibs - they are much, much more effective than CPR at restarting a heart and maintaining some form of bloodflow.

&gt;Well, we've reached the end of our respective tethers. Aston Villa's pathetic defeat to Leicester City at the weekend has brought added depth - and we use that word quite deliberately - to Paul Lambert's loss of control at the club. Villa are the butt of all the jokes and the unsackable man has lost his grip. We're heading in a bad, bad direction.

&gt;In this week's show Chris and Steve briefly look back at the loss to Leicester and preview next Saturday's Premier League home game against Liverpool, but Lambert is the main subject of conversation. If he were at any other club he'd have been sacked long ago. Now's the time for him to do the right thing himself.

Like most Randroids, I went around for a few years mindlessly parroting all the the Rand dogma and imagining I was an ‘individualist.’
Some years later, after becoming a published writer, I actually was invited to meet Ayn Rand once. (I was ‘summoned to the Presence,’ as Arlen said.) I confessed my doubts about certain Rand dogmas and was Cast Out Into the Darkness forever to wail and gnash my teeth in the Realm of Thud. It was weird. I thought the Trots and Catholic priests were dogmatic, but Ayn Rand made both groups look like models of tolerance by comparison.
I thought she was a clinical paranoid. It was nearly 30 years later that I found out Rand was merely on Speed all the time, which creates an effect so much like paranoia that even trained clinicians cannot always tell the difference, and some even claim there is no difference.”

You basically collected the wrappers (this in itself was a bastard, I was never very good at unwrapping the things without destroying the tinfoil) sent them to Cadbury where your account was credited (I think 1 wrapper = 1 point) and then you could bid for some rather cool things like skiiing holidays, a trip to Japan, or a go in one of those zero-gravity planes in Russia.

Being young and stupid, I decided to participate. And I've never been able to eat Creme eggs since, as I am forever mentally scarred by the sight of massive trays of naked, sweaty creme eggs literally filling all the space in my fridge....I couldn't give the things away, I had eaten so many of the fucking things I imagine I shortened my lifespan significantly and for what you ask?

A holiday abroad? A weekend of pampering perhaps? 

NO....

My pathetic attempt at collecting wrappers apparently paled in comparison to this one guy who spent over £2000 on Creme eggs and promptly won almost every one of the cool prizes. I did win a pair of Cybikos, which were a sort of shitty, wireless, dot-matrix-screened things that you could play card games and dice games on.

There's also the fact that he is still only out on license, until 2017 he categorically *has not* done his time, that's an absolute fact.

Personally I don't particularly want him to return to football, but I am very very against him returning to football until 2017. It just makes a mockery of the justice system if he gets out on license and then is able to resume his professional footballers job while he's still serving out his sentence! 

Even using your logic (which is sound) that the justice system should reform him, he won't be reformed till his sentence is served in 2017. And this is in addition to the fact that he still publicly stated that he doesn't think he did anything wrong, and so is by the very definition *not* reformed.

* Finance deregulation
* Wealth is not a zero sum game

**If they don't follow those positions, they get fired.** In Academia, there is independance and you are free to pursue research.

Very true - but at the same time we have to admit that although the vast majority of Muslims view the violence as abhorrent, a similarly large majority support the banning of the depiction of Mohammed. Freedom of expression is a cornerstone of Western society so I think this shows an issue we can't pretend doesn't exist.

I don't like that the current approach is that we are not allowed to discuss these issues at all, instead we are just to accept that violent extremists emerge from a vacuum - well IMO they don't, they emerge from a political, cultural and religious background and we can't arbitrarily ban ourselves from discussing one of those things.

Pochettino has had enough time to assess the entire squad now and it's clear these players aren't in favour for one reason or another. When you consider the wages most of these players are on it's just not worth keeping them around. We are in the slightly strange situation where our bench/squad are probably costing more in wages then our starting 11 and that kind of imbalance shouldn't exist. Our starting 11 are looking very good but the rest of the squad just doesn't fit and is too expensive.

Vlad is our second choice right back, without a replacement (Perhaps Yedlin in the future, but not ready yet) he still needs to be part of the squad. Dembele is on the fringes, and Stambouli deserves more time.


We need four or five players that can give our starting 11 competition for places, right now only one spot on the pitch has enough competition and that is left-back (shocker considering previous years) everything else is nailed on. That means a few injuries could be devastating.

It isn't as if he is only in this role to position himself for a better job down the line. It's not like lots of people see someone with a lot of talent. We should rule him out just because he doesn't know a lot about ancient philosophy and likes Ayn Rand (why he went for Atlas Shrugged rather than the Incredibles I shall never know, but meh).

Don't worry anyone; if we ignore him and just caracture him as an ignorant fool that will be really effective. After all, the intellectual elite humiliating Boris, George W and Reagan was exceptionally effective at halting their approval ratings.

Phil Beard seems to be a nice guy, but maybe it's time to swap him out for someone a tad more suitable. At the turn of the century we were overtaken by Fulham, and within two and a half years we'll have a smaller ground than Brentford, whilst probably playing in the same league as them, having pissed away monumental sums of cash. In fact, should the worst come to pass and QPR go pop, I can imagine some bizarre future where Brentford's new stadium attendances are bolstered by West London QPR refugees left without a team.

Still, I'm looking forward to the Man U game on Saturday. Hopefully we pull off an upset so we can rub it in the faces of all the Man U infiltrator fans who will sneak into the QPR stands. Anything could happen and like you say we're only a few points away from midtable.

Replace the moon fairy dragon by something like an alien civilisation hibernating inside the moon.

While nobody knows what is causing this, humanity launches a desperate mission to find out and... blow it up.

Then, much of the plot progresses as before, even the giant germs (hey, Star Trek got away with it, so I'll let it slide).

But then, the moon isn't an egg, it's a ark of extra-dimensional beings who were hiding inside the moon and the critters are their version of bacteria (they are from a really large dimension).

The Doctor explains that these beings can't hibernate in vacuum but need to live in the matter of the moon and that the radiation is a side-effect of them waking up, phasing out, returning into real space.

Cue drama over: ""what if they conquer Earth?"" In the end, then, they phase out of the moon harmlessly, leaving in a majestic techno-organic spacecraft thing... and then disappear in a wormhole that fills the sky, inspiring humanity not only to go to space but to learn more about science, dimensions, time travel and so forth.

Pension income is taxable income like everything else (except a few specific pension benefits, like war widow's etc.). The reason this was taxed must be because you were predicted to receive more than £10,000 in pension every year? Does that sound correct to you? 

When you look at your payslip for the Nov14  Apr15 job, does it state anything in “Income from previous employment”? If it does, the employer’s pay roll provider is likely to know about your pension income (though I would be surprised if they did). If it doesn’t, you are likely being under-taxed, though unless your pension and salary was really high, I would wager you haven’t actually hit this point yet.

Look at [example 1](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?page=view&amp;resid=1C1DB386405AA757!222686&amp;authkey=!ACAZcGXyD5WDnIk) – I’ve taken the liberty of assuming some numbers (a pension of £1000 month and an annual salary of £21,600/year in your job – do substitute the correct values in a local copy of the sheet. As you can see in my example, the first three months Apr14 --&gt; Jun14, your pension provider is moving forward assuming you will carry on your pension through the entire year and hence make £2,000 worth of taxable income in the year (£12,000 - £10,000; your tax free allowance), so it subtracts £33.33 from your pension, as £33.33*12 = £2000*20%. 

Then, your pension stops and you’re actually overpaid tax from HMRC’s perspective (to the tune of £33.33*3 = £100). If you didn’t get a job in Nov14 you would have been due a tax refund at the end of the year.

But, you do find a job in Nov14 and start taking in £1,800/month (my assumption). Here’s what should have happened: As you start taking in £1800/month, payroll adjusts your annual estimate upwards and you eat away at your tax-refund and start getting back into where payroll predicts that you are likely to make a little bit of taxable pay for the year.

Now, let’s see what happens if your new employer isn’t aware you’ve already paid a bit of tax – in your local copy of the example sheet, set D3:F4 to 0, which creates the world-view that your current employer’s payroll has of you (one where you didn’t receive any taxable income in the start of the tax year, nor paid any tax &amp; NIC on this). As you can see your paycheck for Feb15 and Mar15 slips through without paying any tax. If you undo these changes, you will see that Feb15 and Mar15 again lead to a situation where tax ought to have been paid.

So, assuming my guesses at your pension and salary are correct (they aren’t), you would face a tax bill of £300 by the end of the tax year, when HMRC closes the accounts for 14-15 and realise you’ve been under-taxed.

That said, depending on the size of your pension and salary, the point of actually needing to pay tax may not have arrived yet (in my example, it doesn’t arrive till Feb15). 

I would call HMRC and discuss your two incomes with them. They are likely to issue your employer a new tax-code to ensure you pay your tax now. If you don’t, this will hit you with a lower tax code in 2016-17 or a tax bill to settle in 2015.

Building a squad for Europe is a ""cross that bridge"" situation. There's no point in splashing cash around now only for us to miss europe and have a bloated, expensive squad. Not to mention that if we buy players after we know we've qualified the calibre of player willing to come on board shifts up a bit.

As for if it would hurt us, I would say probably yeah. I expect for domestic cups we would play a lot of kids and bow out early. And in the league the fatigue would start to show earlier in the season, plus we'd probably have more injury problems.

But in the end there'll never be a 'perfect time' to qualify for Europe. You can't put the brakes on and hover around 7th for a few seasons with the idea of building a deep squad because in the mean time our better players will be leaving anyway.

So to answer your question of why we aren't buying players, it's because it's too soon. If we qualify we'll have all summer to fill out the squad.

And Europe might be bad and stretch the club and the squad thinner than it can handle, but fuck it deliberately not qualifying isn't an option.

Given that there are almost 10,000 GP surgeries in the UK this represents about 10% of them. Given that these are (probably) the worst in the UK, we could turn this around and say.

So halfway through the year:

Your personal allowance is: 50% x £10k = £5k (assuming you have one)    
You pay 20% tax on the first: 50% x £31,865 = £15,932.5 above that    
You pay 40% tax on the following: (50% x £150k) - £15,932.5 =  £59,067.5 above that    
And pay 45% on anything above that    

So if you’ve earned £25,932.50 in the first half of the year you calculate your total tax as:

£5,000 at 0% = £0    
£15,932.50 at 20% = £3,186.50    
£5,000 at 40% = £2,000    

So your total tax-to-date should be £5,186.50

This month you pay the difference between that and what your total tax-to-date was last month.

And I wouldn't put too much stock in the fact that Huddlestone played 22 league matches in 08/09, David Bentley played 29 league matches and that guy was garbage.

I'll be using the VAT MOSS scheme. As long as I keep my (direct) sales records distinct per EU country, I can continue to not pay UK VAT as my sales fall below the minimum threshold. I don't believe this is the case for sales through Apple, Amazon, etc.

I agree that the error made here is to not create an EU-wide minimum turnover for VAT. Whilst it might be impossible to have everyone declare a flat band across all countries, VAT MOSS would make it possible to have a minimum turnover for each country.

It seems like a rushed policy that hasn't taken small businesses and the reasons we have minimum turnovers into account. Even VAT MOSS seemed to be a reaction to the outcry from the initial plan.

[Whataboutery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_relative_privation).

&gt; I don't like that the current approach is that we are not allowed to discuss these issues at all, instead we are just to accept that violent extremists emerge from a vacuum - well IMO they don't, they emerge from a political, cultural and religious background and we can't arbitrarily ban ourselves from discussing one of those things.  
  
  
Man A is Muslim. He comes from socio-economic/cultural/religious background X.  
Man B is Muslim. He comes from socio-economic/cultural/religious background Y.  
Man A advocates violence.  
Man B does not.  
Man A and Man B share a religion.  
Given that they have different socio-economic/cultural/religious backgrounds what reason have we to suppose that religion is *the* thing that is the source of Man A's advocacy of violence?  
  
  
Anyway, it's not that you're ""not allowed"" to discuss the issues (what do you think this is if not that?), it's that either focussing on religion to the exclusion of all else, or assuming that all people who follow a religion all believe exactly the same thing is to simplify the issue past the point where it can be meaningfully discussed.

Keynesian economics based on increasing demand through government spending has run it's course in the Western world and has led to the huge national debt we're now saddled with. 

Due to the deficit reduction plan, the UK has managed to stay an attractive place for foreign investment - bringing more FDI in than the whole eurozone combined. If we go back to excessive government spending, it will endanger this as foreign investors will think twice about investing in a country saddled with over a £trillion of debt.

We abandoned the mining industries for very good reasons! We're uncompetitive compared to the south american and asian nations that pay negligible labour charges to get the stuff out of the ground. The wage costs here (and most of the developed world) are simply too high to make a profit and current commodity prices. Commodity prices are determined by global forces and the global supply, so we cannot hope to influence this. (Just think of the problems the shale industry is having in America for a modern equivalent, they can't compete with low cost oil producers).

Also, the financial services industry contributes the highest levels of tax per person in the UK. Why would we want to get rid of it? No Financial services = even less tax revenue = even less money to spend!

Well first of all, not really. But secondly it's interesting that rather than discuss a very real problem which a hugely popular religion has with a fundamental of Western society, you'd rather play the fallacy game. It is absolutely valid to discuss how moderate beliefs can influence extremist beliefs, they set the baseline from which extremists deviate. If the moderate beliefs are already ""extreme"" by our standards, is that not a major issue?

&gt; What really brought about the end of the IRA was the IRA. 

So it had nothing to do with the drop off in funding, and the dismantling of support networks in the Republic due to a population which no longer agreed with either the goal or the methods?

&gt;Their leadership (and Nationalist leadership) had been engaged in talks since the 1980s, long before the first ceasefires and official peace process.

Yeah, because they had lost support as Irish people no longer cared about reunification. Even Irish Americans didn't care anymore. Simple really.

&gt;Given that they have different socio-economic/cultural/religious backgrounds what reason have we to suppose that religion is the thing that is the source of Man A's advocacy of violence?

Well in fairness I said there are 3 causes - political, cultural and religious. I at no point said religion is ""the"" source, so I'm not really sure why you are asking such a pointless question? It's an interesting question, but certainly not one posed by anything I said had you actually read it instead of kneejerking to it.

I think the fact Man A states it to be his primary source is a pretty good indicator that it at least is some part of it. It would be incredibly stupid to ignore that, and should at least start us questioning man B's beliefs as well, regardless of what nameless religion they observe.

&gt;Anyway, it's not that you're ""not allowed"" to discuss the issues 

If only it were true. Your entire response to me is proof that you do not practice what you preach. I specifically stated 3 causes and asked to be allowed to discuss them all including the ""taboo"" one. Your response only focused on religion, once again proving my point, you cannot speak about religion without getting kneejerk answers like this one. It is a valid topic yet any attempt to discuss it is met with one word links to wikipedia or other trite responses.

The current direction of Government is to drag back a lot of Labour reforms. Labour crammed more and more students into unis, some now graduate to jobs they could have got without a degree but with added debt. The Tories want to reverse this but know that closing Universities would be deeply unpopular and make them seem elitist. While I think lower numbers attending University is inevitable what no one is doing is putting alternatives in place, there are not enough apprenticeships or jobs for kids leaving school with opportunities to make a career out of. The Tories don't care, if they don't have work they are lay abouts and scroungers, that's the narrative. 

What they did was to impose quotas on students with A Levels below AAB/ABB (it changed at one point). The aim of that policy was to starve what they see as the bottom of the sector of funding. They can't attract as many good students so can only get students in up to their quota. My opinion is that this policy was designed to try and close those Universities, it failed as it was limiting the size of supposed better Universities (in my opinion the whole good/bad uni thing is nonsense, every uni is good at something, every uni is rubbish at lots of things). The cap also had to be put in place due to the Government caving to NUS and others on lots of parts of £9k fees, just not the headline figure, which has created an unmanageable system that is costing silly amounts of money. 

The cap has now been lifted, at the behest of the top unis, in the hope that the top unis with expansion plans will grow and take the top students from lower ranked institutions. I'm not sure it will work, the Government forget how much many teenagers want to stay as close to home as possible and it doesn't matter who their local uni is. 

While all this had been happening Birmingham saw an opportunity, a loophole in UCAS. The system is supposed to stop undue pressure being put on students and put more power in their hands. Birmingham completely undermined this. They wanted good students and knew that predicted grades were reliable enough that they'd only get a few students who failed if they used them. However they didn't just offer on the grades, they started making conditional offers and told students that if they made them their firm choice it would become unconditional. Basically, you want a place at a top uni guaranteed now or do you want to gamble on exams you haven't taken yet? It's a horrible position to be in for a student worried about their performance. It must have worked though, Birmingham have continued and now other unis have started breaking from the norm to copy them. 

Personally I think UCAS needs to stop what Birmingham are up to, though I'm not sure they can, they definitely can't stop students getting offers on predicted grades. The people who suffer in the end are students. A school wants to get more students in to uni so predicted grades get a little inflated (not always intentionally). The student then gets into a course that as be academically difficult for them based on an assumption that they perform better than they do. They drop out and things get difficult.

With regards to some of your statements though, and believe me I am no Labour loving idiot, only 15% of Labour MPs are privately educated and only 20% went to Oxbridge. So plenty of Labour MPs will have got where they are through hard work.

Social mobility is a huge goal of left-leaning political ideals. Now, Labour isn't the left, let's be real here, so perhaps your point still stands, but it's certainly debatable.

As for no ethnic minority non-christians, I'd like to introduce you to [Virendra Sharma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virendra_Sharma) who is a Labour MP of Indian descent who is also Hindu. Also Ed Miniband is an atheist, but that isn't what you were really aiming at with your 'non-christian' jab.

That said, when I did this I was still able to use my school qualification years later and no one cared. Now more universities want to see evidence of recent study. I would recommend talking to any Universities would be interested in and giving them the honest truth. Find out if your grades would still count and if they don't ask about access courses, it may require study at a college or they may just take what you have.

I'd also recommend getting in touch with your old University as they are more likely to be able to take you back on in that second year than others as they know you've met the requirements.

One thing to watch is funding, I did this all in Scotland and while I got student loans I had to pay my own fees in the first and second year. I'm not sure of the situation in England but get in touch with Student Finance England and ask. Likelihood is there will be some support but you may need to save some money first. I worked 2 jobs for a year before coming back to save the money I needed. 

The thing that annoys me most is that no one knows about what is known as a false start. I'm not sure you would have considered dropping out after first year but, in Scotland at least, if you drop out after first year it's called a false start and you don't lose funding (technically it's now a plus one year but that's more complicated and for anyone not going through college to uni it ends up the same). No one knows about this, no one suggested maybe I should think deeply if I want to go on to that second year. That cost me a lot of cash when I came to go back!

""A SENIOR Conservative politician once described England’s beloved National Health Service (NHS) as “the closest thing the English have to a religion” (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland run their own services). Yet, as with many religions, passionate devotion can often stand in the way of serious analysis. Public discussion is too often reduced to an absurd competition about who can express support for the institutions of the NHS in the most unqualified terms, says Stephen Dorrell, a former Conservative health secretary. Anyone who tries to introduce nuance “quickly finds out what it must have felt like to be regarded as a heretic in a more religious age”."" (My favourite line from that one).

With Balotelli, you play through the centre, you aim for him, he holds it off for the other striker or attacking midfielder. Without the striker it's not nearly as effective a play-style. He tried the hold up style with Balotelli, and it didn't work, so he dropped him and changed it up. Then he tried the battering ram approach with Lambert and it didn't work, so he dropped him. Then he went back to our older style, pace up top, play from outside into the centre and let the speed do the work, and it's more effective so Balotelli can't get into the side.

also, to evidence my point: the team defended resolutely (only giving up 5 shots all game), we kept a clean sheet (6th time ALL SEASON), the weather conditions were HORRIBLE (very cold and the wind was persistent) and the lads dragged out a crucial win for us during a weekend when tottenham lost, west ham drew, swansea lost, everton tied city and scum lost. the only thing that would have made this weekend better is if scum and saints drew their match and arsenal got stomped by stoke. but i'll take it at the moment. we have a large number of players coming back off of injury who will help us, notably sturridge, flanno, (sahko who just came back) and lovren, who as poor as he's been, didn't become a horrible player overnight. we need him for this crucial period where toure is away and i think he will be a useful player for us this season. once he is settled, i think he's a starter next season, a skrtel esque turn around. it seems the quality and physical qualities are there, but the system has him turned around. 

so back to your original point...yes, yes you are the only person who is enraged. I was disappointed that we didn't put them away when they were down to 10 men, but against a struggling sunderland side, with 10 men (which can oftentimes be more dangerous), we pulled out a clean sheet and got a VITAL 3 points. so no i am not enraged.",null,0,null,1421073625,null,0,false,0,cnmhd2g,null,t3_2s5j8c,null,t1_cnmhd2g,null,t1_cnmghlh,null,null,null,1424920602,null,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11,null

I will stick to trying to address your headline then.
Are Redfearn and Cellino Actually Talking About Transfers? Yeah they probably are but the dynamics are not that of a traditional manager-owner relationship.

I think the aim has always been for them to get younger and somewhat cheaper players of championship level quality, from Italy. That when settled in provide a solid base of players who can become a proper team over time and push for promotion. Also players with resale value so we stop pissing money away.

Rather than us repeating the endless cycle of buying overpriced ageing players with 'championship experience' that leaves you ultimately a mid table championship team unless you get lucky.

Now yes it could backfire, as we have seen they are taking longer than expected to settle in and we could certainly use some more experienced players from whatever league to come in and sure us up.

Warnock I would like to stay on for example for that reason but the reality is he's ageing, nearly out of contract and if a good offer comes up and we don't let him secure his future somewhere with it, he could well become a liability anyway being pissed off till summer. Tough one.

Also sorry for the usual wall of text haha

Ask them about the paths for adult learners, there isn't (or at least shouldn't be) a University in the UK without college articulation and access courses. They'll tell you what courses they accept. You'll then apply while you're on the course and the college should be able to help you with the process so I won't go into it here (the UCAS website has good application guides too).

null,false,HappyResultsDay,null,null,null,"Think about your personal statement, what skills do you have that you can tell us about? How do they relate to a degree in general or your subject in particular? If you think there's any gaps go get some experience. Whatever you do think about it in terms of the skills you gain from it, some volunteering can always improve a personal statement and do some good in the world too, win win!

I'd also look for work experience in relevant fields if you can get any, it helps to show commitment in your application if you can get any.

Other than that I'd recommend looking at ways to improve your organisational skills. Many students get to uni and have to organise their own time for the first time ever and fail miserably. Learn how to work an email inbox so you don't lose things in it and forget important stuff. Learn how to make a calendar work for you and get into the habit of always using it so you always know when you're free and when you're not. There's loads of great courses to check out.

Other than that I'd say research, every uni is different, every course is different. You need to find your perfect match to do the best you can. Visit unis, not just on Open Days when we trot out all of the bells and whistles. If you can find out when a lecture is in a course you'd take just show up and sit in, tutorials, seminars and labs won't work like this but at least you'll get an idea of what the teaching will be like also the atmosphere of the campus. 

Finally, look into some MOOCs, websites like FutureLearn, Coursera and loads more have a ton of free uni courses. Take some, give yourself a wee head start, you have nothing to lose!

Yeah, that's true. It was just a little frustrating how loud they were.

&gt; What I meant s that because Chelsea is a popular club you get a larger percentage of fans who just visit for one game. They don't know the chants and don't really add to the atmosphere.

That's a fair point. But (as I mentioned I haven't been to many matches) I learned a lot of the chants just from watching the matches on the TV/computer. It's not always possible to discern what the fans are chanting but after watching several games, I kind of just got it. So when I was at the Bridge in MHL a while back and the people next to me started chanting, I was able to chant along with them. 

I don't want to make a generalisation but that makes me think that either the people who visit for only one match don't watch a lot of them, or are uncomfortable chanting - in which case, they probably shouldn't sit in MHL.

The idea that the UK is an Islamic country, or that Islam is taking over, is in all honesty, utter bullshit. 

The media, and politics in the UK has placed so much spin on linking domestic problems such as unemployment, benefit dependency, undeserving uses of social welfare, with issues such as Immigration. And anything to do with Islam is often overexaggerated. 

2011 census showed that 2.7 million people in the UK identified as muslim, that's 4.8 % of the population. The idea that Birmingham is 80% muslim is beyond a myth it's laughable. I mean a quick Google search gives us the wepbage for Birmingham which estimates that the Muslim population of Birmingham amounts to 21.8%

All taxes will cause some economic activity to not be performed simply because the tax exists. This is called ""Deadweight loss"". The main four forms of taxation are Income, Consumption, Property and Corporation. Of these, corporation taxes cause the most deadweight loss.

In other words, for every £1 collected in corporation tax, more economic activity is destroyed than any other form of tax. Corporation taxes are a misguided attempt to tax the rich when they clearly do not (The wages of the rich are taxed by income tax, not by corporation tax).

The least destructive form of taxation is a progressive consumption tax (taxing income - investments). This, combined with taxing activities that have negative externalities (such as creating a carbon tax), is what we should use.

Logic.  
If you have two systems - one working and one broken - and they share a factor you can conclude that factor isn't sufficient to cause the problem. If it were you'd have two broken systems.  
If you have two men - one violent and the other not - and they share a factor you can conclude that factor isn't sufficient to cause the problem. If it were you'd have two violent men.  
  
  
&gt; The usual attempt to prevent people from highlighting that many moderate religious beliefs feed extreme beliefs  
  
  
Yes, but moderate beliefs of any kind influence extreme beliefs. What's the solution? Abandon moderate beliefs or belief in general?
  

&gt; I specifically stated 3 causes and asked to be allowed to discuss them all including the ""taboo"" one

No-one has banned you from discussing it. Despite the above *I'm* not that interested in discussing religion because I find it rather boring, but that's hardly a general prohibition. I certainly don't think the ""religion's to blame"" line of thinking gets you very far - people have used religion as a means of justifying their own fucked up violent nature for centuries, and when they're not using religion they're using politics, or ""I don't like your face"" as a justification.

3. Not sure if it is a straight Elia vs Mane situation. As Mane has played well in the inside forward role. So I think Tadic is also in the mix, as at UTD where Koeman can mix and the speed of Elia and the guile of Tadic, depending upon the opposition/situation.

Credit where credit is due, to my delight I don't think the defence was the issue, I think it was the midfield that shut down and refused to advance towards more scoring chances that irritated me so much. With the exception of another lacklustre performance from Mignolet the back line seemed to cope much better as you indicated. Also, your points about off the field activity are well thought out and not for debate.

null,false,agentdcf,flair8,,null,"In light of our current situation, I've been trying to figure out how we can assess the validity of rumors. If we accept that the appointment of Paul Mitchell indicates an acknowledged deficiency in scouting, and that the recency of that appointment would not provide adequate time for the appointment or retraining of scouts, the construction of our own black box-style database, etc., then the problems of deficient scouting continue.

Further, we know from the experience of the current squad that raw ability alone is not enough to get a player into the squad. He has to show exceptional commitment on the training pitch, respond to the coach's instructions, and so on. Any player acquired who will not train the right way is a waste of money because he won't feature.

So, any player we acquire must have both the skill set we're looking for (at striker, midfield, defense, whatever) as well as the requisite attitude. With a deficient scouting apparatus at the moment, I think that means we'll see the most action with players that our coaching staff already has some experience with: guys like Hector Moreno, for example, whom Pochettino coached at Espanyol. 

So, when names come up as players we're apparently interested in or scouting or whatever, I've been trying to locate links between them and members of our coaching staff in recent years. So far, I see nothing with Bacca; he and Pochettino weren't even in Spain at the same time, as Bacca arrived at Sevilla the year that Pochettino went to Southampton. 

Another possibility, however, is that Mitchell arrived at Spurs with a list of players he thought were undervalued, overlooked, particularly well-suited to Pochettino's system, etc. And in this sense, almost any player could be a possibility, since he would have been identified in the past year or more with Southampton's black box. The downside of this is that there's no way for us to really know, save digging around for rumors connecting the player to Saints. And here too, I found nothing. 

So, at the end of a totally inconclusive brain-dump, I have nothing to contribute other than to say that there's not really any reason to think that Bacca would be a likely target.",null,0,null,1421078046,null,0,false,0,cnmjd7z,null,t3_2s5q6k,null,t1_cnmjd7z,null,t3_2s5q6k,null,null,null,1424919668,null,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5,null

My story? Lol... I was born into a Christian fundamentalist cult where having 'worldly' friends was heavily discouraged and it was taught that Armageddon is just around the corner so it would be best if members dedicated their lives to serving God and proselytising, rather than pursuing education. When I left the cult my family followed their rules and shunned me, which kinda messed with my head somewhat and I spent the next 10-odd years trying to deal with that and being transgender. I've been homeless in 3 countries, dealt with addiction and until the last couple of years never stayed in one place for more than a few months. Since I began living as female 3 years ago I have a much more stable life, I've worked with national trans and homelessness charities and am about to release my first children's book but that is highly unlikely to ever pay me enough to live comfortably on and the majority of charity sector jobs which come up have very well qualified applicants so I rarely even get an interview.

 [**Tidal force**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal%20force): [](#sfw)

&gt;The __tidal force__ is a secondary effect of the [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force) of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity) and is responsible for the [tides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide). It arises because the gravitational force exerted by one body on another is not constant across it; the nearest side is attracted more strongly than the farthest side. Thus, the tidal force is differential. Consider the gravitational attraction of the moon on the oceans nearest the moon, the solid [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) and the oceans farthest from the moon. There is a mutual attraction between the moon and the solid earth which can be considered to act on its centre of mass. However, the near oceans are more strongly attracted and, since they are fluid, they approach the moon slightly, causing a high tide. The far oceans are attracted less. The attraction on the far-side oceans could be expected to cause a low tide but since the solid earth is attracted (accelerated) more strongly towards the moon, there is a *relative* acceleration of those waters in the outwards direction. Viewing the Earth as a whole, we see that all its mass experiences a mutual attraction with that of the moon but the near oceans more so than the far oceans, leading to a separation of the two.

Bear in mind that if you were letting the property for a full year the standard deposit is six weeks plus first month rent, that's what my flatmates and I were charged in London anyway. It does seem strange though because you're only on a 3 month let.

By my understanding, with regards to the deposit, that makes the contract void and is illegal. If it's an assured shorthold tenancy then the deposit HAS to go into the scheme, with no exception. [This is a helpful guide to the scheme](https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-deposit-protection/overview). Potentially the letting agent doesn't want to have to do extra work?, See what other commenters say here, but if what I've said is completely correct then you need to talk to your letting agent and be clear that you want the deposit protected.

On a side note. From experience, letting agents in London can be a bit of a nightmare. Make sure you get everything and take a note of all payments sent, receipts etc and what those payments covered. Also if you do move into the property get pictures of the place and report problems asap - nothing worse than the letting agent claiming its you who caused the damage and you've got no recourse.

Much though I'd like a proportional system, AV was, and remains, my preferred system for the UK.

I live in a Conservative safe seat, where in reality, Its only Conservatives, UKIP and Labour, so I am limited choices. But personally I would keep Labour out. So my vote can only go to two parties.

That being said, my MP is quite trustworthy to us constituents, he does put our needs first before his party.

I do have strong environmental views, but I would go about it in different ways to the Green Party. I.e. Firstly sort the issue over the EU out first before we try and push for renewable energies. As well as using the economic sanctions on Russia to push for Environmental change there.

* ""Fear Her"" from season 2 is, IMO, unwatchable.  I can't take that little girl's 'scary voice' seriously. CHLOE!

* Also ""The Idiot Box"" from season 2 as well.  The blank faces are ridiculous and The Wire's constant ""HUUUNNNGGRRRYYY"" is just plain annoying.

* I also gave up on trying to get through the two-parter Ganger episodes in season 6.  Just boring, predictable and I can't force myself to care.

* ""Let's Kill Hitler"" from season 6.  They just shove Hitler in a closet for the entire episode!  Oh principle alone, I cannot like that episode since they never in fact killed Hitler.

**Great Episodes:**

* ""The Girl in the Fireplace"" from season 2.  The story, the characters, and the sassy dialog make this my favorite episode.

* ""The Doctor's Wife"" from season 6.  Creepy and great to see the Doctor's interaction when the TARDIS becomes a woman.

* ""The End of Time"" post-season 4 special.  Who doesn't love a good Master episode?

* ""The God Complex"" from season 6. Terrifying and suspenseful!

However, given our current squad, I'd like to see the following needs met, in no particular order:

1. Speedy center back for rotation in order to give Vert/Fazio some rest and give us an alternative defensive match-up options.   This is preferably to replace Chiriches.   Dier can rotate as a back-up and get more experience in cup games and, hopefully, European fixtures.

2. Creative deep lying playmaker with good work rate.  I think this is the big missing piece in the squad right now.   We see glimpses of the ability to recycle/maintain possession with Mason and Bentaleb, but they aren't as creative going forward.  This, in turn, places more pressure on Eriksen and our wingers, which means less chances.   This needs to be corrected for next season.

3. Striker to replace Adebayor and give more competition/rotation for Kane and Soldado who I would both like to remain for next season.

&gt;

&gt;__Argentina v England__, played on 22 June 1986, was a [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) match between [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team) and [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team) in the quarter-finals of the [1986 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_FIFA_World_Cup) at the [Estadio Azteca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estadio_Azteca) in Mexico City. The game was held four years after the [Falklands War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War) between Argentina and the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) and was a key part in the already intense football rivalry between Argentina and England. It was also a match which included two of the most famous goals in football history, both scored by [Diego Maradona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona).

&gt;The first goal, after 51 minutes, was to become known as the ""Hand of God"", which Maradona scored by using his hand. His second, after 54 minutes, saw him dribble past five England players, Beardsley, Reid, Butcher, Fenwick, Butcher (again), and finally goalkeeper Peter Shilton. Argentina won the game 2–1 and went on to win the 1986 World Cup with a victory over [West Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany_national_football_team) in the final. Maradona won the [golden ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards) for player of the tournament whilst England's goalscorer on the day, [Gary Lineker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker), won the [golden shoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards) for being the tournament's top scorer.

When we have Carroll up top, and especially with Nolan in midfield, as has been the case recently, we have a harder time keeping possession.  When the other team has possession Valencia's defensive role has been as that of a left winger.  So when we get the ball back, he's starting out on the left wing more often than not, and we rarely hold the ball long enough for him to work his way back into the middle.

He has a good chemistry with Sakho, and that seems to be missing with Carroll.  Carroll rarely looks for the other striker when he's got possession, he looks for a back pass to central midfield while he peels off his defender and makes a run.  I don't think Andy plays well with a striking partner, unlike Sakho or Valencia.

The only real complaint I have about Valencia is this.  He was our big money signing this year.  He was supposed to come in and dethrone Andy, be our main striker, and score loads of goals.  If anyone has done this it's Diafra Sakho.  So Valencia is fighting to earn his spot, which in my opinion has lead to him trying to hard.  He's been dribbling and dribbling and ignoring the easy pass and looking for the long shot, trying to recreate that Hull goal without any success recently.  I think he needs a couple of goals to give him his confidence back, and help him to be a team player more so than he has been.

I'm not overly concerned about him.

 A show like Doc Who is like a magic show. You know its all fake, but you enjoy the trick because its artfully done. Now in magic the art is in the misdirection.Hes doing something shifty and cheating with his right hand. His 'magic' was just pulling another card out of his pocket, but with his left hand just did a complicated swirl and you were so engrossed in trying to follow it, you missed what his right hand did and the trick was done.

 And so it is with the writing of the story. But in this case while his right hand was trying to slyly pull a 'gravity is broken' card out of his right pocket, his left was actively pointing at the pocket and saying 'Hey look! gravity is broken!'

 What I mean by this is his very first observation is that the gravity not what it should be in the shuttle, and anyone who had enough working knowledge of gravity to follow the doctors point, also knows that the rest of the gravity points the show brings up are fully bullshit. Such as high tide everywhere and shuttles landing in regolith at full earth gravity with no atmosphere will explode, not slide.

The fact is you CAN NOT drawn attention to the very plot holes you want the viewer to not notice till afterwards. The suspension of disbelief is a thing the audience does willingly and almost automatically with a story. 

We temporarily put all our knowledge of gravity and evolution and European history and mechanical engineering  and Kraut rock of the late seventies and early eighties and all the other stuff we don't need for the tale into little mental boxes like they are street clothes and we are going for a swim. BUT the second The Doctor says, 'Hey, do you guys notice something about the gravity?', we the audience will instantly start unpacking our knowledge about gravity again and the suspension of disbelief snaps.

 This episode did that about three times, and by that stage you are no longer engaged in the story. By that stage you are overwhelmed by contempt for the writer that thinks you are that fucking stupid.

null,false,alex_texasiswest,null,null,null,"People have to remember that Sam never really changed, he just used what he had in front of him, and given our summer signings, we could play the way we wanted to, which was a more attractive attacking style.

I personally am 100% behind him until the end of the season, because doing anything else would be stupid. If people call for his head anytime before the last day of the season they will look like spoiled brats. He has managed the team well and made good (not perfect, but good) tactical decisions this season, and its shown, we were 4th on xmas day ffs.

As for whats happenned? I think things changed after West Brom. We were 1-0 up, at home, after two losses, we need to get momentum, and we pressed far too high, against a club that has just inherited Pulis. We did what Sam has nightmares about - committed too much to attack and exposed ourselves to a counter, drawing, and almost losing.

I think this scared him - and so now we've gone to the other extreme the last few games, attack well, get a goal, but then being overly cautious, sitting TOO deep on the lead, inviting pressure, and resulting in the inevitable.

Yes, we've had a few draws, and West Brom deserved a point, but I think our luck had just run out a bit with the disallowed goal against Arsenal, and then the late goal against Everton and the Noble OG at the weekend. 

People will point to Nolan and say he's *THE* problem, he isn't. He is too old yes, but Sam was spooked and Nolan sitting in the box poaching goals is the safe option he wants right now. I think it's too early to say if there even is a long-term problem, lets give him and the boys some time.

Tomorrow night is massive, as is Sunday. I'll be there for both of them and I couldn't be more excited - two home games we should be winning. Attacking, but not over-committing, and defending well.

I deleted the original but here goes...

I thought you were replying to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryWhatIf/comments/2s4xkb/if_germany_had_developed_the_nuclear_weapon_first/cnmbpkp?context=3). Note that's /r/HistoryWhatIf, which is why my original post describes the Germans nuking Moscow.

I thought our conversation was going like this:

&gt;&gt;  some people make extreme claims either way (all Germans were Nazis/no Germans were Nazis)...

&gt; Serious questions: do such discussions get heated or do they remain 'intellectual'? 

My original reply said that it depending on whether the guy was a denier or just mis-informed. Not always easy to spot right away. But my initial response is to pop up the facts with links to as reputable sources as I can google quickly (I really must start bookmarking them but much of my knowledge comes bound in dead trees).

The mis-informed will usually upvote and/or thank. Deniers will reply to the effect that the facts are in question or fabricated. They may well link to Nazi Revisionist sites and some other dubious sources to back up their claims. Google will show you what sort of site/source it is pretty quickly. 

If they seem polite, I may have one more go (could be a copy-n-paste from their dad on Facebook and they honestly want to know if it's true): but denialists tend to be aggressive and fairly easy to spot as such.

I deal with Nazi Denialist the same way I would deal with any other sort of denialist or general fact-dodger.

There's no way to win against a false premise: so an old horse like me will get out quick but leave a fairly barbed parting shot for the enjoyment of the neutrals. I always make it clear I shan't respond further if they keep making stuff up - and then *don't*.

Most times they'll reply with an ad-hom, a logical fallacy, or more links to disproven things. My lack of response is reply enough in those cases. I am too old for flame wars with diehards ;)

Another common response is to change the subject and bring up Allied war crimes - real or imagined. Dresden and Hamburg are popular. A quick reply is sometimes warranted for those.

&gt;&gt;Blah blah Dresden blah blah firebombing blah blah so both sides were as bad, and the Allies only prosecuted Germans. They exaggerated all the stuff about the Heer to cover their own crimes it was only the SS and Nazis who did mass killings of Jews or civilians blah blah

&gt; Hey look, everyone! A lone fact stumbled into view by accident! Well, we agree on Dresden. But as for the rest.. sorry mate: I did say that if you started using made-up stuff again I'd ignore it. The actual facts are still linked to above, for your convenience. Bye now!

I'll include a [horrendously long and badly edited recent post with dubious sources](http://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/2rxep7/my_grandfather_hunting_nazis_in_germany_1945/cnkntb9?context=3) which I now regret not tidying up a great deal more. This guy, I think, was mis-informed, from his single post at this time. He seems nice, anyway.

A much better-edited post is above that one, giving my own views on Nazis in the Heer (German Army). Though note that I consistently call them (wrongly) the Wehrmacht (Armed Forces) in that post; I couldn't be bothered to edit it all after I introduced the Luftwaffe as a  counter-example right at the end.

Strictly, this shouldn't be (and I don't think is) true, if you compare how grades have changed versus how courses have changed. From what I can tell, A-level requirements have risen significantly, whereas degree content hasn't changed much at all (physical sciences here, so things are pretty consistent). Grades are more linked to demand and popularity than difficulty, above a certain threshold.

And there are no ""no-go"" or ""Muslim only"" areas.

Basically you will get a lot of posts and comments and so called reports from the EDL, Britain first, or other far-right wing nutters. I have had people being adament that there is a place in Bradford (where I am from) that if a white person walks there (as I am and have) that people will run out into the street to chase you away or attack you (which never happened). And you can tell them that it doesn't happen, but there is this ever increasing circle of lies, egsagerations, and a willingness to believe that those lies are true. 

People WANT to believe there are areas of the UK and France where the police have no control, and sharia police and courts rule unimpeded.... but that's bullshit... and it takes about 2 seconds of thinking to realise that's bullshit. 

The UK is a multiculturalism success. It's just that that success doesn't stop far right parties (as in, we have the tories and labour, who are like your Rep and Dem, but we also have other parties like libdems who are... well.... leftish.... and UKIP, who are quite rightwing (think tea party) and then BNP (Think Nazi party)) and groups from saying ""Multiculturalism has failed! because.... some brown guy commited a crime!""

&gt;

&gt;In 2001, the main religion in Birmingham was [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity), as 59.1% (577,783) of the population were Christians. The second largest religion was [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam), adhered to by 14.3%. Meanwhile 12.4% of the population had no religion.  8.39% (81,959) did not state their religion, above the national average of 7.7%.  

&gt;Birmingham's percentage of Christians is below the national, regional and county average. The percentage of Muslims in Birmingham is above the national, regional and county average, as are the [Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) (0.3%) and [Hindu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism) (1.98%) percentages. The [Sikh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism) percentage, 2.93%, is higher than the national and regional percentage, yet below the county figure. The percentage of [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism) population in Birmingham (0.24%) is higher than the regional and county average yet almost half that of the national average. 

&gt;There were only 21 out of 354 local authorities in England where the proportion of self-described Christians was lower than that of Birmingham. There were only six authorities with a higher percentage of Muslims. Birmingham's total Muslim population of 140,033 was the highest of any local authority area.

Bear in mind that this was one of their main campaign policies in the last elections and they couldn't dance around the issue any harder, although Mr Clegg did issue a video apology regarding the issue.

[CH4 did a nice little article here on the u-turns.](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/have-the-lib-dems-kept-their-promises/5980). 

If they had the fortitude to follow through with their policies, pledges and even their own party lines rather than pandering to everyone else then they might be respected a little more but instead they piss away all their credibility.

While no other party is any better, the Lib Dems saying specifically that they will oppose it give most people little hope that they actually will.

I think a striker is the one thing we do need. It looks like Ade is already out the door, so we only really have Soldado as backup. The possibility of Kane getting injured and Soldado starting for an extended run of games keeps me up at night. Of course it's difficult to find a decently priced PL proven striker in January, but regardless I think that takes precedent over midfielders, where we have a lot of choices.

yeah man i would love nothing more. it sucks that he had the leg break, i have read various reports from people who watch the academy games (which i unfortunately do not have enough time for) that he was one of the brightest players on the pitch at most times. he's young, so could still develop, but his upside has been talked about before. it is also indicative that he was in some training pics with the 1st team after his injury! here's to hoping he is still in the picture and could be our underrated american super star! i think FSG are holding out on him too because they know that as soon as an american makes it big in england, that will be the jersey everyone wants. the US is a market share grab right now when it comes to football, and the first prem team with an american is going to grab a huge portion of the market share, which is also another reason why i think we will have a serious look at son from leverkusen (except for the korean market)

null,false,TooLeft,null,null,null,"&gt;To lose the analogy, the UK aren't exactly without experience in peacekeeping missions. I get the benefits in relations etc, and I guess that is arguably value enough.

The UK is more experienced in combat operations than with the sort of peacekeeping operations Ireland did in Lebanon, and in general the Irish have a strong reputation within the peacekeeping corps of the UN. Compared to most of their other European counterparts, Irish military was very quickly able to strike up close relationships with the local population (and actually drew Israeli ire over it in Lebanon). Mainly due to having no historic reputation, but also as the military is defensive only and is trained differently.

&gt;I was mostly wondering if Ireland would be contributing financially to this deal

Honestly, very unlikely. For the UK, Ireland is one of its most crucial military allies in terms of position alone and most likely are receiving air-traffic and sea-traffic information, as well as agreements for strategic staging posts etc. Wouldn't be publicised but also impossible to confirm :P

On top of that, for the UK, Ireland is one of its most critical security risks due to the free travel between the two countries, so again any co operation benefits Britain in the long run.

&gt;My knowledge of Irish and British relations is limited, so the boost in relations may well be worth the cost, hopefully somebody with more knowledge on the matter than myself could elaborate?

The relationship is very complicated, but at a governmental level you could say it is normalised - the two countries treat each-other as friendly neighbours.

In the overall balance of things, the UK is probably getting more out of the deal, but Ireland is lifted up in the process. For example extremely well educated Irish workers, their 3rd level education massively subsidised by the Irish government, walk in to jobs over here without ever paying that tax back, while women suffering under Irelands abortion laws take refuge over here as well.

i have been bitterly disappointed with our season so far, but i have learned a very valuable lesson. sometimes you must destroy everything to build a beautiful thing and that in a sense is what BR had to do when he lost suarez, dagger and sturridge to injury. he reinvented the wheel, so to speak, and it hink the benefits to suffering growing pains sans sturridge, suarez and some other key players has been the other players have had to learn quickly and grow up quicker than expected. when we throw sturridge back into the squad, we will have a team ethos that he can slot right back into and enhance, rather than carry and build himself. the team is on track to finish the season strongly and if we finish 5th or higher with a cup win or two, i will be laughing at everyone on this sub's face for doubting rodgers. it could go the opposite way and i could be proved wrong, but i would rather have to eat my words b/c i supported BR then lose faith and be proven wrong. 

you make some seriously good points though in your initial posts. first being, i wish our midfield could dominate games more and keep the foot on opponents throat. we should have been able to nick a goal in the 2nd half to alleviate pressure, but to be honest, minus that 10-15 minute period, they never looked likely to score, which is a credit to lucas, the defensive work and mignolet, who is looking more and more confident. perfik, you and i are one in the same as fans, and we have every right be upset we didn't put that game away a lot earlier, but lets face the facts that the team is looking a whole hell of a lot better. the squad is growing before us, and we have emerging leaders in hendao, coutinho, sterlinho, sahkinho, mignoletinho, caninho...lol enough with the brazilian names but you get the point.

Generally, it's difficult to get funding for an MSc, and it would help if I knew which field you are hoping to study in. In my field there are things called ESRC 1+3 studentships, which provide funding for an MSc (1) and PhD (+3). But they are very competitive, and not all universities offer them. The best thing to do would be to check the website of the institution you're interested in - they will usually have a list of potential funding sources. A lot of these will be quite niche, though. For example, my university offers a grant specifically for students from Hungary. 

Finally, Barclays and the Co-op bank both offer something called a Career Development Loan. This is the route I took.

There is a condition known as isotretinoin-induced rosacea: if that is a possibility the main thing would be to seek a formal diagnosis and prescribed treatment. In the short term application and reapplication of a high factor broad spectrum sunscreen is important, just as it was when you were on isotretinoin.

Once you have a formal diagnosis we will be better able to help you. I have been diagnosed with papuopustular rosacea (more flushing than pimples) and atopic eczema myself, others here have seborrhoeic dermatitis and other skin conditions. The problem is erythema linked to rosacea doesn't have the same underlying cause nor the same effective treatment as erythema from, say, seborrhoeic dermatitis. Also there are several subtypes of rosacea, which all require a slightly different approach. There is also /r/rosaceahelp/ 

Lastly review your diet and lifestyle choices, ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle.

I accept that the student fees pledge was stupid when they knew a hung parliament was possible. But it wasn't malicious - the Tories wanted unlimited fees but they compromised with the Lib Dems on a cap of 9000. 

What do you suggest Nick Clegg should have done. Remember were in 2010, election has just happened, Tories (who pledged they would introduce unlimited fees) are the largest party. The economy is circling the drain, our deficit is huge and investors are losing confidence fast. 18 months earlier our entire banking system nearly collapsed and £500 billion had been pumped into them to stop total catastrophe. What investors and companies (and individuals) want and need is stability and an economic plan of some kind. The Lib Dems have 2 choices. They can abandon the country to a Tory minority government that could be easily outvoted and thus would be very weak and unstable or it could join the Tories as a minority ensuring that the important economic stuff gets dealt with and let stability return (which it largely has) and maybe you will get some policies passed too. 

I do not envy Nick Clegg with that decision. One way you risk economic collapse, the other way guarantees you will have to give up on most of your policies because the Tories are bigger and so get to pass more policies. I think he chose the right way and helped being stability back so that we could at least think about the long term. 

Unfortunately Clegg has to deal with people like you who pick up on those policies the Tories passed instead of the Lib Dem policies (as was their right as the larger party) and declare the Lib Dems liars and crooks because they haven't passed every major policy. Why are you not angry that they did not pass their foreign policy? Or their education policy? Why do you focus on student fees? It's a policy area just like the others that the Tories had control over.

Again what would you do in Clegg's position? You go into negotiation with the Tories on what policies to collectively support and you say ""Student fees are an important policy for us"" and David Cameron says ""No, we have control over uni education in this government and we want to raise fees. If you can't agree to that then we can't firm a government. We can give you an AV referendum which you also promised but we are putting Tory ministers in charge of universities and that's final"". What would your response be. Does he betray students or voting system reformers? Or maybe he gives up on his policy of raising the minimum tax threshold which has raised hundreds of thousands of people out of tax? Who do you think would be less angry - who would you piss off. 

Unfortunately this will be the pattern of politics for the next decade at least coalition governments where each party (probably the smaller one) has to give up many of their policies especially the big ones which will be under control on the larger party. You better get used to it as must the general public. This constant whingeing on the internet and in the media about who passed what, when everything is negotiated in advance and where both parties make sacrifices, makes it impossible to actually tell who you agree with. 

Coalition policy is not Lib Dem policy, nor is all of it Tory policy. You have to look past that and decipher what parties stand for before you decide who's evil and who's not. Being upset at the Lib Dems over not passing certain policies is about as pointless as getting upset that you aren't being given your yearly raise because your employer has gone bankrupt. You're ignoring the much bigger and more important reality that makes the original promise nigh on impossible to achieve and it obscures the bigger picture. Maybe it was stupid to pledge something you were not sure you could keep to but it doesn't make sense to feel betrayed - to be betrayed by someone they have to at least be given the option of helping you only to deny you help. That's not what the coalition was.

There are of course exceptions and obviously if you have a degree in accountancy you have a better chance of getting on a charted accountancy grad scheme. To start in some banks front of house operations, i.e; High street branch, you don't even need a degree. And once you're in, work your way up from the inside. 

Eg: Aviva recruit people from 'numerate'/'sciency' backgrounds for their grad courses in accountancy, underwriting, insurance etc. From what I have heard from friends employed by KMPG, PWC, if you have a numerate degree you have a good chance of getting in, proving you have the right people skills.


I studied Maths &amp; Physics and am now employed in the Utilities sector, despite my degree not really relating to my job. 
I know of a History grad who works as a project manager for BAe, despite not really knowing what a Eurofighter Typhoon was before starting.
Another works for the NHS as a Data Analyst, 'no petri dishes in sight, just lots of Microsoft Excel' and has a lab orientated MSc Biology.

With a science background, especially something requiring such attention to detail, you should be able to do most none specialist careers. 
One thing I can recommend, if you are having no luck with direct applications, there are a number of agencies who recruit on behalf of companies, they generally aren't as fussy about what degree you have, only that you have one. 
Your degree doesn't confine you to one path. Hope you find this useful, I would say 'good luck' but as a physicist, I don't believe in imaginary variables.

&gt; Firstly sort the issue over the EU out first before we try and push for renewable energies.

Does that mean you consider the EU more important than the environment? Or just that you think the environment concerns can't be solved until the EU situation is resolved? Either way, the environment isn't going to wait while we squabble over things like that, and who knows how long that could take.

&gt; The EU is not fit for purpose anymore, and it seems likely they won't reform any time soon, so in reality, it will have to be rebuilt.

What do you mean by that? Lots of countries in the EU are doing great, so it must be doing something right. And i don't see why you would want to rebuild it at all if you don't think its working.

Then you'd have to stream all that data - from every camera (kinect, laptop, tablet, phone, dashcam (if your car has one, some insurance companies prefer it now)) to whatever storage or processing system they have. Even if you didn't notice the computer running slower, you'd definitely notice the internet slowing to a crawl. End edit.

Which is why warrantless surveillance of *everybody* is a damned stupid thing for GCHQ or anyone like them to want - it's ultimately self defeating. I can understand (but don't like) the idea of them tracking a threat without a warrant if it's intelligence led, but would prefer they have an alternative authorisation system behind it.

For example, allow them to start tracking immediately, but only on the basis that they apply for a warrant retroactively. Can't get one within 72 hours? Everything recorded and captured is inadmissible and gets torched.

&gt; If you have two systems - one working and one broken - and they share a factor you can conclude that factor isn't sufficient to cause the problem. If it were you'd have two broken systems.

&gt; If you have two men - one violent and the other not - and they share a factor you can conclude that factor isn't sufficient to cause the problem. If it were you'd have two violent men.

So any time where religious war has taken place, all average people sitting at home immediately also became violent because that is the only possibility?

This is like saying violence isn't a cause of murder. There are lots of violent people, but they don't ALL kill people (some of them just beat people up on a weekend), so you can't blame violent personalities.

Come on, this is the most flawed logic of all time. And it doesn't even take in to account that the people committing the act literally said it was in the name of their religion. They literally, not figuratively, said it: ""We have avenged the Prophet"".

&gt;Yes, but moderate beliefs of any kind influence extreme beliefs. What's the solution? Abandon moderate beliefs or belief in general?

No, openly and vocally criticise a huge number of our fellow citizens holding to beliefs which are completely outside our societies norms, and try and use our free speech to eliminate those aspects of their beliefs, as happened in Christianity. The fact that moderate muslims hold beliefs which are already extreme to our eyes just pushes their extremists even further.

&gt;The problem is violent people and how to stop them being dicks to others without lapsing into the same violence.

I think this is a very common sentiment of ""don't criticise the religion"", but when the moderate base of the religion is already extreme to most non-Muslim people, I think it's crazy to ignore it. 

Do you think there are no religiously motivated young men getting drawn in to these causes? You hear countless stories of it happening, people being radicalised through Islam and travelling abroad.

It's a really good point about having to rebuild from the ground up and I think that part of BR's genius is that he has the balls to do that job and not just try to quick fix the issues. I think the first half of the season in the long run will make us stronger, I think BR was right in thinking that it will take time for the new signings to gel, I believe that most people didn't realise just how long, being tied to their hope rather than their judgement. To be honest maybe you are right, maybe I was terrified rather than enraged or maybe I was mired inbetween.
I have to say that the performance without Sterling was a welcome surprise, it's great to know that the team is able to rely on each other without him especially given all the hype. I am also warming to Lucas and Can both of whom have taken a great deal of criticism but who are proof I believe of the plan that BR has in place.

I would be interested to know what his plan is for the window, for me, I think a keeper and a striker should be first on the list because as much as I would love Balotelli to come good I just don't see it happening with the current setup. I think he will do better with Studge back in but it would be preferable to have another striker on hand just in case DS gets another injury. Someone to run around and distract the defences while Balotelli poaches and waits like the true predator that he is.

null,false,juliantheguy,null,null,null,"I think the frustration at Andy is likely attached to the tactics around Andy.  So if we take Carroll out, we can't play the hoof it up tactic.

I think the second half we're missing is that Alex Song is basically the lynchpin to this entire framework.  He's the only player in the squad trying to thread these 20 yd passes up the pitch and on the ground.  He's got the defensive stability to hold off play and the creative skill to thread the pass.

Nolan isn't going to bring that. And Allardyce doesn't play him with that goal in mind anyway.  Nolan's meant to be poachy and stir up trouble.  I think our midfield gets stuck with these ""jack of all trades"" dependable player types and we need a little more specificty in the role players hold.

Song and Downing are the bright side of our defensive and offensive half.  They both do alright in hold up play and creating chances. Kouyate, Noble, Amalfitano, and Nolan are to some degree interchangeable on the pitch.  But if we lose Song to injury or country our system breaks down.  

Additionally, when we change shape by bringing in Joey O'Brien or a third CB, downing gets pushed wide and we see the same problem. We don't have the same positional advantage to take risks and find gaps in play to slide the ball in and on frame.

Carroll and Sakho can be a great partnership, but if the tactic is reliant on the long ball up to Carroll to lay off to a second striker or out to the wing, we totally eliminate the chance for Song or Downing to create a bit of magic from the center of the pitch. So I think that's where the frustration comes in.  Carroll is forced to flick the ball on or play it out wide, which doesn't open up any space, it just carries us a little further up the pitch and from there our only option is a cross in from a fullback.

This is my best understanding of how West Ham play football. So my hope is with Song back in the lineup, we should resolve a lot of frustration.  I also think Collins and Tomkins are pretty reliant on a long ball up to a forward, while Reid seems to play through the midfield a little more often than not, so when we move into 70' minute tactics with 3CB's we have a 2/3's chance of seeing a long ball up the pitch.",null,0,null,1421088115,null,0,false,0,cnmoyny,null,t3_2s6lmj,null,t1_cnmoyny,null,t3_2s6lmj,null,null,null,1424917005,null,8,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,8,null

But there was a certain point in the 90s where the enmity seemed to dissipate. Average people just didn't care anymore, it was and still is only the communities in NI which hold on to the hatred, which at this point is more about family/blood feuds than it is about the 6 counties.

At the end of the day the two countries are culturally similar neighbours with prosperous societies - we could hold on to past grievances, but what would it achieve?

null,false,HighburyOnStrand,null,null,null,"I think his comment is incredibly irresponsible.  In the precise context she says Jews are the target, he then asks her whether Jewish people (Israelis presumably) have not inflicted suffering on Palestinians.  There are two fundamental problems with this.  

First, there is seemingly a justification for targeting Jews, due to Israeli policy toward the Palestinians.  I think it is very easy to interpret that question as explaining a rationale behind targeting French Jews.  Meant or not, the impact on the listener is profound, and obviously there can be no rationale behind shooting up a supermarket.  Also implicit in his comment here seems to be an implied moral equivalence between murdering unquestionable civilians and killings during what is sadly an ongoing conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.  Doing so seems to ignore the fact that Palestinians have presented an ongoing threat to Israelis (regardless of whether the Israelis have grossly overreacted) and French kosher supermarket shoppers have presented a threat only to lettuce and bread.  

Second, there is a seeming ignorance of Jewishness as a religion, apart from statehood.  Here is an interesting commentary which might shed some light into why many find this type of questioning so offensive:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/01/12/the-bbcs-tim-wilcox-projects-the-last-two-hundred-years-of-european-anti-jewish-ideology-on-an-elderly-french-woman/

In short, Jews are not being regarded as French or Britons, or whatever first and Jews second.  This is a dangerous implication as much anti-semitism--especially during the Holocaust--played on this very concept, that Jews were not true Germans, were not to be trusted, were subverting the state, etc.  Honestly, this is very scary to hear, even when it is definitely not meant in a directly nefarious context.

Amalfitano is a wide man. Sometimes we ask him to play centrally, but his bread and butter is bombing up and down the wing.

Manchester United have QPR (A), Leicester (H), West Ham (A), Burnley (H) and Swansea (A) - no 'big' teams, though I'm sure they'll still manage to screw a couple of those up.


Arsenal's next five are Manchester City (A), Aston Villa (H), Tottenham (A), Leicester (H) and Crystal Palace (A) - Man City aside, Arsenal will be favourites to win those.  A draw with Poch would be good for us, and hopefully the Pardew magic is still running by the end of February when they go to Palace.


Tottenham's next five league games are Burnley (H), Sunderland (H), West Brom (A), Arsenal (H) and Liverpool (A) - Arsenal and Liverpool will both be tough, but Sunderland and West Brom are two of the easiest games in the league at the moment.  

Worth pointing out though that Spurs are still in the FA Cup (replay this Wednesday), League Cup (two legs of the semi-final) and the Europa League, so combined with a couple of injuries and general fatigue they could drop off.  If Harry Kane or Eriksen get injured then they are screwed.


Also slightly worried about Liverpool, but they're 7 points behind us at the moment and their next five games include West Ham and the third place team (us!); they're also in a two-legged semi-final against Chelsea which will hopefully wear them out and ruin their confidence when they get comprehensively beaten.

There is a constant myth that Scottish Unis hate English students, I can see where it comes from because of all the independence referendum stuff and the way that was being reported down south, also having a government in Scotland who couldn't care less about English people makes people assume that we all think that and that our institutions follow. The reality is hugely different.

The Scottish Government pays Scottish (and EU because of a quirk of EU law) students' tuition fees for them. It can't just write unis up here a blank cheque so we are limited on the number of Scottish/EU students we can take in. There is no cap on students from down south or outside of the EU so Universities that want to expand can only expand in these two groups. International is a seriously competitive field because of the money involved so right now a growing Scottish uni wants more students from down South.

lucas for me is regaining form he already had, and can is one for the future. people who were asking can to be thrown into the deep end by october were crazy. there was no chance he was fully ready for that, and if he was, BR was protecting him. he's had no other choice but to throw manq and moreno in the deep end, and he is protecting them now. marko was protected early on, and balotelli was thrown into the deep end. balo and lovren being the two players who were supposed to slot straight in. i think balotelli can come good, but i think you're right, after this season he is likely gone. but if i had to choose, i would axe borini and lambert this summer and keep balo, studge, bring back origi and see if ibe fits into our plans...if not, buy another striker, if so keep him.

* One of the first comments I left.
""*You seem to be forgetting the fact that in space there's no atmosphere, it's never cloudy, and in geosynchronous orbits it's never night, a perfect place for a solar power station to harvest uninterrupted power 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.*"" 


* Geography is also a big factor, not every nation has the room to develop conventional solar power, a classic case for this is Japan, where usable land is at a premium, nuclear power is a taboo and it is not willing to rely on the Persian gulf. This is why JAXA is arguably the leading nation in development of this technology and is hoping to have developed satellites with the capacity of a nuclear power station by the 2030s.


* Feasibility and the economies of such a system are also coming along in leaps and bounds ""*By 2014, the company’s (Space X) next rocket, the Falcon Heavy, aims to lower the cost to $1,000 per pound. And Musk insists that’s just the beginning. “Our performance will increase and our prices will decline over time,” he writes on SpaceX’s Web site, “as is the case with every other technology.” *""[Here](http://www.airspacemag.com/space/is-spacex-changing-the-rocket-equation-132285884/?no-ist)


* What the US would need to build in order to meet it's projected energy consumption [here](http://youtu.be/3_m6tlF901g?t=5m56s). This is why I showed you the Kardashev scale, energy demands rise not fall and our near term solution (in the scale of energy) is to seek the energy directly from its source. The Sun.


&gt;Climate change is not a matter of necessity spurring invention. The technological solutions are available right now, and in fact have been for some time. The problem arises from politics and economics.

No economics is, either through governments forcing energy supplier to develop new technologies through green levies or the costs of current technologies not being profitable.  Seen, as the first is often an insurmountable hurdle in many nations the second is far more likely. 

&gt;The results of climate change could easily be sufficient to set our knowledge back a long way. Even without ongoing catastrophe, knowledge is lost all the time. You mention the Apollo program; if we wanted to launch equivalent missions today - that is, not do anything new, but simply repeat what already happened - many years of work, at great expense, would be required to rediscover the knowledge that has been lost.

Not really sure what you are getting at, firstly I take issue with your idea that climate change could overnight set us back and your second point is not really of any significance. However with reference to Apollo you should know that space development for future such missions is well underway and is in fact another reason why I suspect costs to be reduced for space based solar technology. [see here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proposed_missions_to_the_Moon)

&gt;And that's all in the absence of widespread food shortages, extreme weather, rising sea levels and a rash of warfare breaking out at numerous currently simmering flashpoints.

Yeah……. I’m not going to delve into that as I fear we are somewhat diverting from the original point of our discussion, namely 

You- Don't worry, some magic future technology will sort it all out somehow.

I've heard of courses where lectures are taught by video link to second rooms to fit in everyone admitted and students put up in dorms that were once common rooms. That's not a nice start to your time at uni. Sadly I can't see a party that has what I'd call a good plan for HE. I didn't mention the SNP in that bit above but they're as bad really (we do have a new Education Minister though so we'll see if that's an improvement). Any party who can promise to select it's ministers based on experience and knowledge of a field not how senior the post is seen as being would get my vote.

2. They're managed by a small time manager known as Nuno, who also shares Mendes as the agent.

A team that should be consistent champions League, is now struggling with fourth after millions were spent on transfers. He even saw through a €25M deal for Enzo perez, who's deal is running low anyways at benefica.

Let me get this straight, there is sewage spraying on your belongings??

You can take them to court for the value of the ruined property, it is their fault they did not do proper maintenance - this happened after they were made aware of the problem.

Additionally, if your boiler was not working properly, and it is your only source of hot water, that is contrary to section 11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 and your landlord must fix it or risk prosecution.

One thing I know is that your deposit is safe. Assuming it's in a protection scheme of course, I don't see any way the landlord can justify taking any of it, assuming you have not done any damage to other parts of the property etc.

Take photographs, write a letter, take it to the agents, and send to the landlord. You do know the landlord's details, right? I am sure they will want to know the actions of the agent managing their property.

You have every right to find alternative accommodation immediately and expect to be reimbursed. If they refuse you can force them to pay in court. The caveat is you are without your money in the interim.

EDIT: Also, since we can assume there has not been a time this month that the problem has been fixed, I would instruct the agent to return this month's rent to you. You are well within your rights to refuse to pay it if the situation is as you describe. If they refuse then make sure you do not pay them any more rent, and begin the small claims process. It is *unsafe* a *health hazard* and you can probably sue for a lot more than I'm suggesting. You may even be able to have them prosecuted.

In short, go all out, make the hugest fuss you possibly can, threaten them with everything you can, and maybe you will get something reasonable out of it. If not, carry out your threats.

EDIT2: Also you can involve your local council because you have hazardous biological waste in your living space.

Immigrants are generally poorer than the population already living in the area. People from other backgrounds such as Indian and Pakistani and most other backgrounds for that matter are also less likely to be employed and when they are employed earn less on average than white British. This creates poverty as they have to rely more on charity and this fuels crime.

Social tension is not just white British vs everyone it often forms tension between large minorities such as Pakistanis and Black British. This again create poverty and crime.

Wiki says this about police state;

&gt;The inhabitants of a police state experience restrictions on their mobility, and on their freedom to express or communicate political or other views, which are subject to police monitoring or enforcement. Political control may be exerted by means of a secret police force which operates outside the boundaries normally imposed by a constitutional state.


Now, a lot of these things look an awful lot like that;


* You will get arrested if you put something on social media that the government don't like.


* The government are setting up a scheme to make sure toddlers have the same ideology as them. [\(not joking\)](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11323558/Anti-terror-plan-to-spy-on-toddlers-is-heavy-handed.html)

* You will get arrested if you protest in places where it might actually matter.

* Our telephone calls, texts, emails, internet history, and webcam images are currently or will be all monitored by the government. 


[Guardian article on webcams](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/gchq-nsa-webcam-images-internet-yahoo), 

* The government are introducing a bill to ban people with opinions they don't like from; TV, social media, interacting with certain people, meetings, public speaking, and even banning them from certain locations.

That way you'll hopefully get wee reminders and there's barely a uni without those presences as a minimum.

For accommodation you'll probably get an email from both unis with details. You should be applying for accommodation as soon as it opens (though that might not make any difference as most unis try to be fair to people no matter when they apply so long as it's before their deadline). No harm in getting onto their accommodation websites, there may be some limitations on what you can apply for for your insurance choice, not all unis do it but some do.

In many ways Swansea parallels Rosenborg so I think that may be a huge part of it, or at least the edition of Rosenborg I grew up with.

Withholding rent should always be a last resort, but it is not true that you lose any rights at all. A tenancy does not end just because you stop paying rent. You still have full rights that you had before. 

This is where the agent does not want to take responsibility for the situation - the situation being one where **raw sewage** is entering the tenant's bedroom. This very much counts as a situation where witholding rent is a *good idea*. For one thing, it can be better used to find and secure alternative accommodation. Think of it as less money to have to fight for in court. 

The fact is, OP can keep their rent, and sue the company/landlord for all their additional expenses. As long as the place not habitable no rent is payable anyway. They don't lose anything by doing it, and they certainly don't lose any legal rights.

EDIT: Seeing lots of upvotes on the incorrect comment but still no mention of what specific rights are lost. Funny that.

Instead he voted for additional fees and the inevitable subsequent fall in support from the student population who are affected (and others like me who value honesty and trust).

Mobile spyware is more common than you might expect - for example, the top 10 android ""flashlight"" apps all have access to file data held on your device and internet. What possible reason could they have for wanting such access, if not to exfiltrate data? More to the point, there have been an estimated 500 million downloads of these apps - why are people even installing these when they get the privacy warning screen at install?

Hardware hacks, custom firmware are all possible - but generally would require some sort of targeted attack. i.e. they identify a suspect, and then hack the phone.

This is different to the current mass surveillance and interception that is possible. For example, gmail has had HTTPS security for years. When the traffic gets to google, it goes to a gmail web server - this server has to decrypt the data. That google server then contacts the gmail main database servers by connecting over a private internal fibre-optic cable which is unecrypted (why encrypt this, when it is a private internal network between different buildings on campus?). It turns out that NSA had located these private cables between various gmail servers, dug them up and spliced into them without google having any idea.

So, even secure services like gmail can be compromised, because there is a central point of weakness - all the data has to be stored unencrypted, or encrypted with a generic key. If you can compromise the central point, you have total access.

With true peer-to-peer end-to-end encryption, there is no mother-lode which you can hack to get access to everything. You have to hack each individual user. 

Yes, you may have methods to hack individuals-  but how do you hack 100,000,000 individuals without getting noticed?

DLA = Disability Living Allowance. It's not an out of work benefit, but is meant to cover the additional costs of living with a disability, so you can claim it even if you are in work, or to cover the additional costs of your child's disability (as David Cameron did for his son Ivan before he died). It's currently being replaced by PIP, which appears to have tighter criteria for the higher levels of support.

ESA = Employment Support Allowance which is for when you can't work due to illness or disability. So if you're unemployed and break your leg you can get moved off onto ESA, and then back onto JSA once you've healed up and can walk properly again. There's different levels of ESA - the assessment rate is the same as JSA iirc, and you get that until you have your Work Capability Assessment. After your WCA you get put in the Work Related Activity Group if you're deemed as having the prospect of being able to work at a later stage, or the support group if you're deemed as not being able to work long term, and you get a higher rate of ESA in the support group. (My understanding of the distinction between the two groups may not be totally accurate, but you get the general idea).

Maybe a week in I noticed the expiry date on the MAP serum in the tiniest writing (I do need an eye test!) and it is just five weeks from the date of ordering. By the time I noticed it was already well expired. Even if I had started using it the day my order arrived I may well not have used it up in time, the whole point of MAP is that it is more stable than L-AA.

No response to my first message before Xmas - I did go through my spam folder - so have messaged again today. Given there was no quibble service the first time I hope this is simply a Christmas related oversight. I still have the expired MAP serum in my refrigerator, expecting to need to return it since it is the second problem from one order..
