I certainly agree that soldiers should be held to a higher standard; but I would be surprised if ""rape"" wasn't below every possible standard, higher or otherwise -- so really it doesn't matter that the guy is a soldier.

It would only start to matter, if there was evidence that soldiers were more likely to do this sort of thing or that they were being encouraged to do so by their superiors.  That doesn't seem to be the case though.

&gt;They were waiting for him to extricate himself from the Everton contract, but that is taking far longer than expected.

&gt;“I haven’t been working in football for long and can say this is a weird working environment,” said Sampdoria President – and movie producer – Massimo Ferrero on Sky Sport Italia.

If I were in charge of the explaining, though, I think I'd just give the Doctor some lines about Time Lords going through periods of varying levels of hormonal activity, and that at the moment he's more or less on ""pause"" in that department, and enjoying the calm in that respect; and then take on board whoever knocks on his TARDIS door, because they're curious enough about a big blue box on a previously unoccupied street corner to ask a question.

- Clara is my favorite companion because she's smart (smart enough to have a real career, unlike any of the others on this list except Martha), she's outgoing and brave (which is not unique to her but still a plus nonetheless), she's got attitude and isn't afraid to tell the Doctor off (a trait shared only by Donna), and, most importantly, she strikes me as the most human of the bunch. Especially with Capaldi. Her relationship with him, I feel, is the most important Doctor-Companion relationship of them all, because Capaldi is the Doctor that's constantly reminding us, through his dialogue and his behaviors, that he is in fact an alien. He's the least human of them all, and so he needs a good human character to bring him down to Earth (no pun intended). That's why Clara is perfect for him. I didn't like Clara as much when she was with Smith, because Smith was already very down-to-Earth and human (albeit a goofy one). He was childlike, and in need of parenting. That's why Amy and Rory were perfect for him. But I'll get to that in a second.

- Amy and Rory were my second favorites, for the reason I just said. I liked the family dynamic that they shared with Smith. It felt very warm and comforting, like they would be fun to hang out with as a group without the expectation of running from aliens or saving the world. But at the same time, we know that could never happen, because as we saw in episodes like ""Amy's Choice"" and ""The Power of Three"", Amy and Rory's lives are very boring without the Doctor, and they're not sure what to do with themselves. That's why Clara has the advantage over them. She has her own life outside the Tardis, her own career as a school teacher, her own relationships, etc. Rory kind of has his nursing job but it doesn't really make him happy. And Amy certainly isn't satisfied with that lifestyle.

- Martha and Rose are tied for third place for me. I like Martha because she's really smart, resourceful, and probably the bravest of them all. She would have gone on to have a great and promising future even without the Doctor coming into her life. My only problem with her was that she had very little personality beyond loving the Doctor and wanting to impress him, which was the same problem I had with Rose. But Rose was with the Doctor the longest, and of course she was the first (of the revived series, anyway), and so I guess for me, she feels like the quintessential companion, in a manner of speaking. She's like...the trendsetter, you know? Some are better, some are worse, but she's just the one that sets the standard.

- And Donna was my least favorite. Now, the last time I talked about this I got -15, but that doesn't bother me enough to change my mind. So I'm just going to repeat what I said before: Donna was literally just a plot device in human form. She had almost no personality, except being a snarky bitch. Everything good about her could have been acheived with an inanimate object. I would rather have watched a whole season with her grandfather as the companion.

For nice areas can't speak much for Lakenheath, but I don't think it is especially good or bad. Most areas around here are fairly nice. I don't know of any really bad areas (though I hear Chatteris isn't much and parts of Thetford can be rough, but I don't have personal experience)

A couple of points that might help though - you will find though that the moment that you open your mouth and they hear the accident, they'll ask if you're US military and then, often, as what your rank is. This is because - at least as it was explained to me - that the military pays a fixed amount for housing based on your rank, so all of the rental companies tell you that the cost to rent the place is whatever the maximum the military will pay for your rank.... Essentially they take as much as the can from the military. It won't affect you because you wouldn't have gotten the difference (I don't think) You'll also find - again as explained to me - that most places that rent to US service personnel will not come with a fridge, freezer, dish washer, washing machine or drier because the base provides that stuff. They usually have hook-ups for and space for US sized devices. You may also find long leases because you're in the military - one place wanted us to commit to a 3 year lease.

Personally I used [YourMove Lattimore](http://www.your-move.co.uk/estate-agent/newmarket.html) in Newmarket to find this place. I happen to know that there is a company called ""Beatrice Carter"" who deal exclusively with the US military - they were actually pretty irritated when they found out at a showing that we weren't in the military. Mostly I think that this was because of the rent/rank thing.

For your cats, make sure that they have shots so that they don't need to go into quarantine for 6 months. I'm sure that the base can help.

Bury (pronounced Berry) has an beautiful cathedral and the abbey garden's have a gateway that your daughter should approve of, it isn't an actual castle, but the playground inside should help :) Not huge numbers of castles in this area, but check out the [English Heritage website](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/eastofengland/) This area wasn't big for castles. Also I'm going to say not that if she likes clambering around in trees and listening to stories then you should take a visit to [Bewilderwood](http://bewilderwood.co.uk/) come the spring/summer. I also recommend [Thetford Forest/High Lodge](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-7xwlfc), great for the playground, walking, biking, a sound trail and a den building area. You'll also be next to Centre Parcs, which has a great pool. Come summer the Norfolk coast is beautiful (but the water isn't warm, sorry this is England).

For sports I have no idea. Horse racing is big in Newmarket - so if your daughter wants to see horses this is the area, unfortunately the jockies don't really like kids around, for safety reasons I think (kids make noise and these are skittish horses) -  I know that Cambridge has Cambridge United football (soccer) team. There's probably other teams though, most places have at least one team, even Newmarket.

Anyway this probably hasn't helped with much and I'm am certain that the base will be able to help loads because they do this all of the time. I'd be happy to help if I can though so PM me if you think I can help.

Edit: Update:
Sorry I forgot about the phones. We use ours from the US on T-mobile/US. They do international roaming and it works well enough. Really need to switch to UK simcards though. Possibly virgin since they have a bundle it with your cable deal. *shrug* iphone 4s and Galaxy S2, both work fine.

Also tip for US redditors in this area. If you have a Costco membership then keep it. There's a Costco about 1hr away (actually two are about the same distance). In the UK you can only get a Costco membership if you're a lawyer, work for government, teacher, doctor, in the emergency services, etc. You can just be a member of the public like in the states, but they still accept US Costco membership cards :-) We let ours lapse, but then when we found our renewed it over the phone and had it forwarded on.",null,0,null,1421874027,null,0,1421877395,0,cnwgc3s,null,t3_2t73a7,null,t1_cnwgc3s,null,t3_2t73a7,null,null,null,1424479335,null,2,false,cambridge,t5_2qh8u,2,null

Scotland doesn't have to spend that £1 on the NHS or cut that £1.50 from education, Holyrood can arrange the pie chart however they wish.

This ends up in situations where English NHS spending goes *up* but on the whole because of cuts to all the other devolved areas (Education, Police etc) the Scottish pot goes *down*. Then the SNP get blamed for not matching the NHS spending increases. Yeah, no shit, they'd have to make similar level cuts elsewhere to find the money to do it. That would be literally just adopting Tory spending policy.

It was set up this way because, in short, Labour are twats. It works *really* well if both the UK government and the Scottish government have broadly similar spending plans. Labour just assumed they'd always be in power in Scotland so it could work in tandem with Westminster when they were in power and used to kick the Tories when they weren't.

Obviously it hasn't worked out that way, Scotland hasn't reacted well to being the Labour party's *PLAYMOBIL mini government*.

Essentially, when we *are* scoring it's because of our offense and center midfield, whereas in the past we were scoring when our defenders were making runs. The problem is that our defense is still making runs, but with the style of play that an actual striker brings we're just not capitalizing on them like we were when we scored off the wings or off crosses.

And to be honest, maybe it's bullshit from the FA that they're the ones calling you out for it, but given you've got the exact liverbird logo and LFC that's used currently on the shirt, it's not like you can really claim you're not infringing copyright. The fact that it comes from the FA is kind of a moot point considering that if it had come from the club themselves you wouldn't be able to have any argument whatsoever. Which means it could also be the third bullet point and the FA are raising the infringement and you're being flagged because it's pretty obvious that you don't own the rights to use the club crest either.

null,false,Firefox7275,null,null,null,"There is a journal article on diet and acne over on /r/skindietandnutrition/ which is a review of all the quality research up to publication. IIRC its findings were that a high glycaemic index diet is a potential issue, as well as dairy *but not for all by any means*. There are various schools of thought as to why that night be, one being the hormones in milk.

I would suggest cleaning up your diet generally initially, ensuring you are eating a proper balance and quantity of all food groups, and thus all micronutrients. If you then notice a pattern between intake of plain dairy (not the sugar added or processed stuff) and breakouts or SD flares it would be wise to discuss this with your GP or another health professional.

Never cut out whole food groups without increasing other foods to compensate for the lost nutrients. It is not easy to eliminate dairy and maintain balance: if you say increased, say, nuts you would also be increasing inflammatory omega-6s and so on. Our pre-dairy ancestors would have eaten a seafood heavy diet, the small bones in fish and a lot of bone broths but this tends to be unpalatable to the modern UK or US adult.

null,false,Firefox7275,null,null,null,"You can see the cleansers I and others have tried and tested in the mega reviews thread linked to in the sidebar, you will note I do not use foaming products. If you wish to use those Simple KTS Refreshing Wash Gel and Boots Simply Sensitive Cleansing Wash are both sulphate free IIRC. You can also get either of the CeraVe cleansers on Amazon, these are well thought of over on /r/skincareaddiction/ but nobody here has yet reviewed them.

Toners don't have a defined function as such or duplicate the function of other products. In a western routine they are an additional cleanse step, I do not believe double cleansing is necessary if you use the right product and technique, unless you wear heavy or greasy make up (guessing not!). Some are astringent or alcohol heavy so are irritating or drying, which is a disaster for sensitive or already irritated skin (SD). Also you can waste a lot of product on cotton wool pads which is fine for the Simple one but not so much for Paula's Choice.

Toners can be useful if you need to lower the pH of the skin after cleansing and before using an acid, but I would always encourage people to use a cleanser that is the right pH for skin at ~4.5 to 5.5 anyway (only applies to water based products).

An Asian style routine and Paula's Choice have a toner as a sort of extra serum step - something that lightly hydrates and adds a few antioxidants or other skin friendly actives. All the toners I am playing with at present follow this philosophy but none have water as the first ingredient. IMO if you are trying to streamline your routine or save money toner is an easy cull.

Last thing is a favour in return: please contribute to any or all of the mega reviews as and when you have time - products you are using now and/ or ones you use in the future, good bad and meh.

We had Suso, sent him on loan and bought a similar sort of player for £7M for some reason that isn't entirely clear to me as he didn't get much of a chance either and is now following a similar career path to Suso.

Many wanted us to buy depth, we did and loads of it, the kids will be the ones to suffer for it as they are very unlikely to get many, if any, chances to play in the first team in the immediate future as they've been supplanted as 2 or 3rd choices by more senior players.

&gt;Police officer here..

&gt;You could call us. We probably wouldn't treat it as a priority but would get to it eventually I think.

&gt;Usually words of advice would be enough to get them to move it. As for actual offences, maybe you could argue it's obstructing the highway in some way. If they didn't move it so you could get out I suppose I could report them for that. If it's poking out into the road it might also be considered leaving a vehicle in a dangerous location

Another interesting reply was:

&gt;Section 54 of the Protection of Freedoms act 2012:

&gt;Offence of immobilising etc. vehicles

&gt;(1)A person commits an offence who, without lawful authority— (a)immobilises a motor vehicle by the attachment to the vehicle, or a part of it, of an immobilising device, or (b)moves, or restricts the movement of, such a vehicle by any means,

&gt;intending to prevent or inhibit the removal of the vehicle by a person otherwise entitled to remove it.

&gt;Call the police, it would likely not be considered an urgent response, but someone would get to it eventually.



Personally I'd call 101. You've tried to have a polite conversation about it and the bloke clearly doesn't give a shit, explain that to 101 and I'm sure they'd sort it eventually.

We've talked about this time and time again on this sub, and I'm sure we all know the measures that need to be taken to improve it. 


Liverpool's home support, however, is equally as dull in the smaller games. It's only in the larger games that their fans get fired up for it (it doesn't take much for a Scouser to get excited). It's not necessarily that they sing more songs, it's more that they get right behind their side when they are losing, or are having a good spell. For example, when they have a spell of pressure and the ball goes out for a corner, the place will erupt with thousands of fans screaming ""COME ONNNN"" or something of the like. This is why it's so hard playing away at Anfield, as this energy gets passed onto the players who play at a higher intensity as a result. At Stamford bridge, however, fans tend to get more nervous and quiet if we start losing. And the stewards having a go at anyone who stands up is, in my opinion, the main problem. Fans are no where near as vocal when sitting as they are standing up. Younger people who are willing to sing and get right behind their side find it hard to get tickets and these tickets are instead being sold to neutrals and tourists.

When you have decided how much you are willing to put toward paying off your debt, your second goal should be to work out what your aim is for the rest of money. Do you want it to:

1) Generate an income over time

2) Increase in value (capital gain)

3) A mix of these

Each of these aims has different strategies that can be used to achieve them. Really doing some research would be the best idea and your bank should be extremely useful in this regard. Start having a look at the stock market, and think about buying shares in companies that you like and think will do well after researching them.

Letting this money simply sit in your bank account is not really a good idea but if you do so, make sure you spend it on something tangible that you can use and keep everyday. 
Try not to be tempted to spend it on such things as buying tables at nightclubs, or eating out at expensive restaurants every week etc etc. I'm sure you get the picture.

He's shown maturity and a very solid, young defender, who has taken his chances when we're playing 2 games a week for the entire month of January. Game time, and exposure in important games but not against the most dangerous of attacking teams, he did very well alongside **Vert**, who i think has really shown his class again this season after a fairly adequate previous season.

**Davies** - played very well for being fairly alone on that left side.

**Stambouli** - I like how calm and cool he is on the ball, until he looses it and it creates panic for everyone. He reminds me of a little like Dembele but is a little more risky

**Soldado** - for the little time he played, i like how he provided a different option than Ade. He was involved in the play, and looked hungry to participate in the game. This hunger is what makes him have his better games, not scoring goals, but he's definitely been involved in many goals/build ups in the last few weeks

**Eriksen** - Didn't have the most directly influential of games, but without him, we're a much weaker side. His creativity, he draws players in, opponents know how threatening he can be on his day, did his part today.

EDIT **Townsend** - I'm still not a complete fan of his, especially when he's selfish and skies 20 balls a game into the upper stands. In my opinion, the more he sticks on the wing, drives at opponents and puts in a decent cross, the better I think he plays. I'm still not convinced he's better on the right than the left, but i like how his partnership is growing with **Walker**. 2 pacey Englishmen like those 2 are a danger, and while Townsend didn't have any outstanding performance today, i think he did his job at sustaining high pressure with Walker on the right side.

null,false,BritishLibrary,null,null,null,"So I've had a stab at a few calculations - please take these as ball park figures, as your monthly earnings, and gaps in earnings will probably change the sums a little:

[Link removed]

A bit of a breakdown about the pay you have received.

You normally have a £10k tax free personal allowance per annum. Per month, this breaks down to about £833. Any thing you earn above this gets taxed at 20% (up to a threshold).

You also pay National Insurance* on anything you earn above £153/week, at a rate of 12%. 

Your tax free allowance 'accumulates' each month, so as your first pay period in July, your allowance at that point would be £3,332. In theory, you should only pay tax on the remainder above that. From August on, you should have been taxed as normal.

As you're on an emergency tax code, you've been taxed on the total of your earnings, without consideration for your tax free allowance, at 20%, and then NI deducted at the 12% rate.

*February Pay* 
Your new employer should receive from the HMRC a new tax code which will adjust your pay to account for any tax overpaid. In your first employement, you've paid tax on around £12,000 earnings total, when you should only pay that on £2,000 (above the threshold). 

You should in theory have a tax code adjustment to allow you to receive a refund, of £2,000 (20% of the £10k you paid tax on). However, if what you've posted is accurate, between the Feb and March pay dates, I don't think you will fully recooperate the tax, leaving you with something to be refunded.

Anyway, assuming in February you take £5100 (gross), I think that will leave you with a total of £4600, after NI paid at around £500. Normally, you would pay £850 in tax, but this should be returned in your pay.

You'll be owed about £1,150 in overpaid tax after. Part will come in March, part will come from the HMRC at the end of the tax year.

Hope that makes any sense!

As such, Sheffield spend every match trying to break down packed defenses, grinding out draws.

The unCFCtv dailymotion site pirates most of it, but misses a good deal of the Chelsea TV videos.  It's only a few quid a month to subscribe to Chelsea TV, and I see it as a small way to contribute to the club's financial well-being- even for those who can't afford a kit or a matchday ticket.  Additionally, if the channel isn't producing revenue for the club because everyone relies on pirated content, the likelihood of Chelsea TV continuing to produce quality bits is quite low.

In short, I'd love for them to follow the lead of other clubs by adding tunnel cams, more player interviews, and the like to increase the value of a subscription.

Another scenario that was outlined to me is that:

* As a result of the bumper month I was paid (with redundancy), my next paycheck would be taxed as if that bumper month was my base monthly wage.

* Because I had already reached the 10k threshold, that 40% of my wage packet that month would be taxed, plus whatever my N.I contribution would come to.

* This money that I had overpaid would be paid back to me in instalments over a certain period.

So my big issue is essentially, that I have borrowed 1,000 to get by till February 8th, which I need to pay back ASAP. February obviously then brings another month of rent + bills + expenses, which I'll need another 1200 minimum for.

This cascades into a whole series of effects: you expect something close to a medicinal product and thus your perception of taste is influenced for the worse; you are constantly reminded by the entire apperance of the pack (and not just by a single warning label) that you are doing something undesirable and unhealthy, thus associating negative feelings to smoking; every time you smoke you are also aware that other people will see you with the telltale box in hand, compounding those negative associations.

The problem is that your night-consumption rates are off-the-charts. I'm guessing you have night storage heaters (The ones that automatically store electricity during the night, and emit the heat over the next day, yeah?)

Well you're either cranking those bitches right up, or that you have shitty insulation.

Here's my advice:

Step 1. Change providers. The Scottish Power standing charges are known to be fucking ridiculous. This is not going to resolve your problem, but it's probably a step in the right direction. Look for a standing charge of around 15 pence or so. Have a look at EDF's Blue Price Promise plans.

What you want:

- Standing charge of no more than 20p
- Day rate of no more than 18p
- Night rate of no more than 8p

Step 2. Turn your heating a little bit down, and get used to the idea of wearing a jumper. You won't just save money, you'll help the environment. Oooo. Look at you, being an eco warrior! Well done. :)

Step 3. Get your house checked out. It doesn't matter if you have the cheapest heating in the world if your insulation is dog-shit. Roof insulation makes the most difference, next is double glazing, and last is wall cavity. I say last because it's the most expensive. All of those three are very effective and will make a difference, but they're all very expensive and you need to look at them as an investment.

null,false,BritishLibrary,null,null,null,"The month with the redundancy pay - did have a tax code or were you still on Emergency Tax at the time? 

Normally, tax works on a cumulative basis - your personal allowance is split over the year into 12 equal portions, and each period your earnings are allocated against that period. Your previous earnings are only used to determine how much of that allowance you've used. (An emergency code is non-cumulative, so it treats any pay period in isolation - ignoring any tax you've previously paid). 

From your bumper month - they would know how much tax you paid, but they will only tax you on what you earn in the next month.

Point 2 - I think is a little more complex. If your new companies Payroll department work efficiently, they should get an adjusted tax code that compensates for the overpayment in tax. Effectively the code would adjust your threshold to allow you to earn more - before tax gets deducted - Adjusted such that the overpayment is cancelled out. However as you only have 2 pay periods left this tax year, it may not work like that. (Effectively getting the tax back in installments).

If you don't get an automatic reduction in your next pay slip, keep hold of all your records - around April you will get a P60, which states your earnings for the year, and the tax you've paid. You'll need this to go back to HMRC to get a refund.

The only issue I would forsee at the moment, is that you will have a **higher** NI deduction in your February pay on the 8th, because it is 2 months rolled together.

In a solely insurance-based healthcare market, Id be uninsurable. It would bankrupt me and my family, no doubt about it. I'm a huge supporter of the NHS.

The thing is, politicians think short term, and hence are willing to keep increasing NHS spending exponentially for the foreseeable future.

However if you look to the long term, it's fundamentally unsustainable. 

The 65+ population is set to double by 2050, with people also living a lot longer. The cost is going to rocket and unless people are either prepared for massive tax increases or huge cuts in other areas, we do have to at least consider alternatives.

Personally I'd first opt for a much stricter system on foreign nationals coming to the country, all of them requiring NHS-approved health insurance so we're not funding health tourists. That will at least save some money to give a short term reprieve, and reassess closer to the time.

I'd also nationalise the pharmaceuticals industry so the NHS doesn't get screwed over by companies with patents. People claim that the NHS has large purchasing power and influence because it's such a huge organisation, but that doesn't make a difference if a company has a patent on a wonder-drug. And we can also start research cures rather than symptom relievers. 

The sad thing is, people don't recognise this is a discussion that will have to be had at some point, they feel like anyone even suggesting we might have to consider looking towards other ways of funding health care is a raging right-wing capitalist who should be ashamed at even considering the thought of it.

1) Weirdly I was talking about this with my Dad last night. He was telling me how each transfer window we'd add one or two players slowly building a squad up over the seasons. Our Success also came from having a couple of great managers of the back of each other from Shankly to Paisley to Fagan and then to Dalglish. We done a similar thing to Modern day Barça and moulded each new manager internally before the previous manager steps down.


2) I would define Success as winning the league or doing well in Europe. 


3) We can be historically considered the most successful club in England we've won the most (iirc) trophies in England and also have the most amount of trophies in Europe 5 (Champions League) out of any English team. Which is a great feat. 

4) Honestly I think we're taking the right steps right now to success. Last season although we came second we didn't have the squad of players to maintain that high of a level of competing, since our run came out of nowhere. Now we are building a squad in the right direction. We will need to get top 4 and maintain that for a couple of seasons which will allow us to attract higher talent and give our team the experience in Europe they need. As Rodgers has cleverly IMO bought a young squad of talented players with a couple of seasons playing together under their belt I think they can push on for success. In the 70s and 80s money played a lesser role in how to push for success. A lot of teams could come out of nowhere to win titles for example Everton in the 80s. The way to do it now is to as I said build a squad and gain Champions League regularity to attract bigger names, as we don't have the money to do it without that exposure.

Like I said in the Biscuit Tournament, biscuits should be judged by:

1. Deliciousness on its own, without tea

2. Deliciousness after being dunked in tea

3. Structural integrity after being dunked in tea

The Penguin sadly only does well in one category.

1. The Penguin is the most superior non-tea biscuit. It's just a snack biscuit.

2. Bourbons and tea go well together. When you dunk a Penguin in tea, it's the same taste, but all the chocolate melts off into the bottom of the cup.

3. It's not any more or less soggy than a Bourbon, but the chocolate just slides right off.

The trick where you bite two ends of a Penguin off and drink tea is still what brings it over the top.

So, judging from the two of them, the Bourbon and Penguin are tied.

1. Penguin wins for being extra-chocolatey

2. Bourbon wins for just being what a Penguin is without all the chocolate falling off.

3. Bourbon also wins, since none of it falls off if you do it correctly.

But, wild card, you can't do a Penguin Slam with a Bourbon.

What a lot of dealers will also not tell you is that their used bikes are 'sold as seen' or 'as spares or for repair', and you may miss that little footnote when you sign the papers or are already too invested emotionally to back out at that point.

Then there are social aspects of church today that appeal to women (eg playgroups), but that's also somewhat chicken/egg.

**Youthful Eye Cream** least favourite nspa product, wouldn't bother with this, didn't hydrate my under eyes at all for me. Not sure if they still have it but the **Nourishing eye and lip treatment** works so much better, hydrates the under eyes nicely 

**Deepy Hydrating Facial Oil** Impressive blend of oils for the price, if you are after a lighter textured facial oil blend this is for you

**Oil free moisture gel**  surprisingly hydrating gel formula, leaves skin soft &amp; smooth due to silicones. Non  greasy but not a truely 'lightweight' formula though - works nicely as a serum

**Hot Cloth Polish** thick, creamy, hydrating great value works nicely if you are after a hot cloth cleanser for dry skin - tried more expensive ones and find this better 

**Skin Renewal Gel** and  **Melting Cleansing Gel** ( both very similar) takes a little massaging into the skin due to the thicker constistency of them, but melts into an oil which turns milky then rinses off nice and clean. Main difference for me was that the Melting cleansing gel is high in caprylic/capric triglycerides, skin renewal is free from it , so if you are sensitive to coconut oil pick up the Skin renewal instead. 

**Replenishing Moisture Mask**  great pick me up for dehydrated skin, works nicely as an overnight treatment, skin is left feeling very soft &amp; hydrated ( I just recently splurged on the PC Skin recovery hydrating treatment mask and prefer this stuff so much more!) 

- Important note, NSPA products are quite heavily fragranced so bare that in mind! 

Also has anyone tried the Double Action Youth Serum?

I agree in principle but don't think it's practical. I think the issue is that it's hard to filter the time/resource wasters until they've been seen. If GP appointments cost money then you may find people neglecting conditions to the point that they cost more to treat later on, or worse, impact mortality and quality of life.

But someone with slight breathing troubles, an infected wound or other minor ailment that may be an indicator of or precursor to something more severe could be deterred.

I think it's an unfortunate necessity of free and accessible health care.

I'm all for charging for sick notes, x-ray/ultrasound images and any other services that don't interfere with vital healthcare delivery though.

He has a hatred for anybody that is not like him, I.e. poor to working class or foreign (unless rich). I've lost count of the number of people associated with him or in his party that have been shamed in the press for blatant racism. He defends them to an extent but himself is very careful in what he says and how he defends them.

A benefit claimant may need a car so they can travel to a place of work. They're claiming tax credits to top up their salary and are struggling just about to get by thanks to help from mum and dad. Or they might be disabled and unable to take a bus. Or they might not have a bus route near them, or at least one that wouldn't leave them potentially isolated from their family and friends. (not everybody lives in a city)

All this nonsense about **common sense** is a complete insult. He's like the guy down the pub that comes up with the most ludicrous ideas that have been made up in his head on how the country could be better run ""because it's common sense, obviously"".

Except, Nigel Farage, this fucking guy is a politician and may very well be in the Commons in the coming months.

And as for cyclists on pavements, well, that's not going to work. A lot of pavements in the cities have been made smaller in order to widen roads.

null,false,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,null,"&gt; a lot of terrorist income is still from illegal sources e.g. Taliban controlling poppy fields, the Real IRA extorting shopkeepers, etc..

That is true, however one might argue this is in part due to the fact these groups are unable to raise funds legally. 

&gt; the donations themselves are still illegal. 

While technically true I don't think this point is in good faith, my argument is that these donations should be legal and these ""political"" groups should be allowed to philosophically exist.  
Our current situation gives undue precedence to the course of political action the government takes in military activity and outlaws other parties when they engage in military activity creating this ""good"" and ""bad"" narrative in public discourse that I personally find to be incredibly disingenuous.  
I personally think that the Green party are onto something here, especially given that the UN still are unable to define ""terrorism"" (where all parties agree upon the definition) and the cognitive dissonance that occurs when labeling groups such as Hamas as terrorists, given they are now democratically elected by the Palestinian people. This point typically leads the argument to the point that our democracy is ""better"" than theirs or something along those lines. Its true that Hamas receives funding from Iran and its true that Iran supports this proxy Sh'ia/Sunni war, however is that any different than the reasons the West engages in military activity or has in the past (I'm thinking Contras, 70's Afghanistan or even the Afghan warlords we supported in the 2000's here). At the end of the day this all ultimately is about proxy wars and ""terrorism"" is the result of supporting questionable groups because you feel as though they support your political aims. Al Queda was bourne of US funding in Afghanistan to fight against Communism and ISIS are bourne from Emirates funding to fight Sh'ia influence. Regrettably in all these cases the funding ends up supporting a different cause to the one the backer originally intended.

Mostly this comes down to the point of power. If you have a military advantage such as the US or Israel you are permitted to engage in military activity and pass off civilian casualties as ""collateral damage"". If you are not in a position of power you are unable to significantly put a dent in the ""enemy's"" ability to wage war and all aggressive acts you perform are labelled terrorism, even if you strike at political or military targets. This creates this disingenuous narrative where heroes and villains are labelled as distinguishable entities even though they likely share very similar characteristics and belief systems.  

For me it comes down to this absurd goodies/baddies distinction that 80's action films so dearly loved. I think the problem is much more complex than this and a better understanding would be achieved by allowing these groups to form genuine political organisations. As it stands most of the UK population don't understand the true aims of groups such as ISIS or Al-Queda resulting in the discourse of these subjects to be pointless due to the lack of correct information. I'm not saying I agree with these groups nor that their aims are just or reasonable but the debate becomes pointless without access to their accounts of why they do the things they do. Most people don't even know the reason _why_ Osama Bin Laden employed those individuals to fly into the twin towers (revenge for Israeli bombing of Lebanon) which, considering its political significance is a disappointing ignorance.   
I would also posit this ignorance is the reason behind Islamaphobia. If you don't understand the political reasons for these groups one starts to associate their aggression with the only thing they do know (that they're Islamic), however a decent grasp of the history makes it evident that all this fighting IS political.",null,0,null,1421886578,null,0,1421888253,0,cnwo3pn,null,t3_2t2j06,null,t1_cnwo3pn,null,t1_cnwnoy2,null,null,null,1424475675,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

So why is it they are going after the *disabled*, the weakest, *most* vulnerable members of society?

... And who in their right mind would suggest taking back what the middle classes were overspending from the *poor*?

There's no logic to it, and even less morality, it is sickening to have to read these assertions by people with absolutely no compassion or empathy for people who are *far* worse off than they are...

I'm not saying that people committing fraud shouldn't be (rightly) prosecuted, I am saying it is absolutely abhorrent for rich folk like the Minister to go after genuinely disabled people the way they *are* doing. 

Any Govt Ministry that has a  deliberate policy to deliberately antagonise and provoke a reaction from claimants to give any reason to sanction/cut benefits from the most vulnerable members of society is clearly acting immorally if not illegally....


&gt;""John Longden –Personal Adviser

&gt;A Statement on events witnessed by me at Salford Jobcentre Plus and Rochdale Jobcentre Plus between 2011 and 2013

&gt;Summary

&gt;1.0 Managers at both district level and in the local office created a culture which encouraged staff to view the customer (benefit claimant) as an obstacle to performance. The Jobcentre operations became wholly performance led. Sanctions of customers were encouraged by managers daily, with staff being told to look at every engagement with the customer as an opportunity to take sanction action. I was personally told by a manager to “agitate” and “Inconvenience” customers in order to get them to leave the register. The staff performance management system was used inappropriately in order to increase submissions to the Decision Maker and therefore to increase sanctions on customers. Senior HR managers condoned this behaviour by refusing to issue guidelines on appropriate time limits on performance, which encouraged managers to look at short-term targets above staff development, fairness to customers and appropriate behaviour as set out in the departments own values.

&gt;Detail

&gt;2.0 Managers at Salford Jobcentre, created an environment where every action with a customer could lead to loss of benefits. They made the decision to mandate customers to all job programmes regardless of their suitability. They did this by applying a benefit direction on the customer to make them attend. The purpose was to increase the opportunity to sanction a customer, should they fail any part of the direction. My line manager reporting back from the district managers meeting stated that the message from the District Manager with regard to customers was –“let’s set them up from day 1”. Managers’ actions and words didn’t reflect the values and behaviours set down by department, they set the wrong examples and acted without any accountability....

SNIP!

&gt;3.5 22/07/11 – spoke with my line manager [name deleted] about customer interviews that were being booked where the customer was not informed.  These interviews had been booked by the office manager [name deleted] for the intention of closing down the claim and claiming an off-flow performance target or to take DMA action against the client. She had indicated clearly in the conversation box that the interview had been booked and the customer notified in person with a letter by hand. This was clearly illegal action and gross misconduct. There were many instances of this happening with other advisers. [name deleted] accused me of lying – so showed him the evidence. No action taken and the bookings continued.

SNIP!

&gt;3.15 05/07/2012 – new line manager [name deleted] tells me to stop phoning and emailing vacancies to customers and asks me to get them into the office. I ask why and she tells me that I need to “agitate” them. I ask her what she means by agitating and she says – we don’t want people to get comfortable claiming benefit, we want to inconvenience them so that they will sign off."" (sic: My edits. From written evidence to the Parliamentary Committee [here](http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/work-and-pensions-committee/benefit-sanctions-policy-beyond-the-oakley-review/written/16165.html)).

How is that *not* illegal?


&gt;""Ian Wright, a former personal adviser at a Leicester jobcentre, says he was ordered by managers to send more claimants for sanction,and was threatened with disciplinary action when he questioned the policy.
&gt;Unscrupulous staff would target weak and vulnerable claimants for sanctions, he states. In one case a customer who could neither read nor write was formally directed to put their CV on a job match website. “Unsurprisingly they did not manage this task and were sanctioned.” (sic: From [here](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/20/jobcentre-hit-squads-benefit-claimants-sanctions))


Can anyone really justify such policies from the Govt of a *civilised* society?

1. There is no ""UK"" driving licence, there are Great Britain licences and Northern Ireland licences.

2. The DVLA issues GB driving licences. When you apply, they ask you to declare when you came to live in the UK. If you are a British citizen, they have no visa or passport stamps to check; anyway, if you are a British citizen in the UK, then for their purposes you have come to live here. Otherwise, you would need to give the starting date of your latest visa - there are certain rules about continunity which are not relevant to your situation.

3. Australian P1, P2 and full licenses from any state/territory will all be converted to full GB licences. Proof of passing the test will be required.

4. When converting a full GB licence to an Australian license, you will receive the license applicable to the length of time since passing the test. So if you have just passed a test in GB, then try to convert it to an NSW licence the next week, you will get a P1. You will then need to take the NSW tests in order to get a P2 and then a full. If you try to convert it 1 year after passing the test, you will get an NSW P2. If you want a full NSW, you need to wait 3 years after getting your GB licence.

5. Therefore, if you live in Australia, then there is no way to avoid going through the probationary process, unless you are willing to lie to police. If you are, then you need to pass the test in GB, get the full licence, then wait 3 years and then convert. Meanwhile, you will be using the GB licence in Australia illegally. When stopped by police, you need to show them ""proof"" that you are only in Australia temporarily (i.e. on holiday), in order to satisfy them that you don't need an Australian license.

I waited 3 years after getting my full GB licence before converting it to a full NSW one. However, I did not have to lie to the police because I live in the UK and only go to Australia on holiday. As I am an Australian citizen, the NSW RTA (now called RMS) was happy to issue the full NSW license immediately.

Serums are usually in addition to moisturiser: they are your targeted treatment product, similar 'category' to a prescription topical.

1) Make sure you have a tupperdore/humidor to store your cigars properly.

2) Generally speaking when you've received cigars by mail it's best to put them in a humidor/tupperdore for about 2 weeks to rest. If you smoke them immediately after they arrive they typically won't taste anywhere near as good as they should.

3) In the UK especially the cheapest way to get ahold of good cigars is to take part in box splits with others. That is you and another person (or more) agree to buy a box collectively and then split the cigars between each other.

Perhaps in the context of a newspaper the image of a topless woman isn't appropriate (and it certainly isn't *necessary*) but I don't see how the recognition of this at all impacts upon the argument of those who argue for Page 3 on behalf of feminism.

Exactly when is female nudity appropriate? Pornographic magazines, which are also campaigned against? The internet (where the government presses ISP's for filters, and there are laws limiting the production of many types of porn)? I mention these only because I feel they are all part of the same problem; we have a ridiculous attitude towards sex and nudity in this country, and it's only going to get worse if a topless woman in a newspaper is considered so offensive that we have to debate the appropriateness of it. I think implicit in the argument that they are just boobs is really that such a topic doesn't warrant such serious discussion.

In these scenarios what I personally do (and I'd be interested to hear if you see a flaw in this way of thinking) is try to envisage the viewpoint of each side as if it was believed by the whole population. One one hand you have a society that gets so offended at a picture of a naked woman that you'd think it was an image depicting rape (the NMP3 campaign website does state that it's a contradiction for The Sun to both report on rape and show a topless woman).

&gt;ST361 The Green Party accepts that certain uses of genetic engineering may be benign and may lead to enhanced quality of life, but believes that the release of GMOs (genetically modified organisms) into the environment potentially poses substantial risks to biodiversity, human health and animal welfare and that there is currently insufficient research to quantify risks. In addition, genetic engineering of animals can cause significant suffering.

&gt;ST362 Control of research and the use of genetic engineering by a few multinational companies threatens the autonomy of farmers and health services and makes profit an underlying motive for the use of GMOs.

&gt;ST363 We believe that:
1. The precautionary principle must be applied to research using genetic engineering.
2. Research should be genuinely in the interests of humanity.
3. Animal welfare and biodiversity must be protected in research (See also AG623, AR408, AR412 ).

&gt;ST364 The Green Party supports a moratorium on the release of GMOs into the environment and on importation of food and feed containing GMOs, pending comprehensive assessment of the safety of GMOs with regards to the environment, biodiversity and human and animal health. We support a legally-binding protocol making industry liable for cross-contamination and any adverse effects of GMOs. (See also AG623-4, CC254, EU489, and FD208).

&gt;H326 The safety and regulation of medicines will be controlled by a single agency. This agency will ensure that medicines meet minimum safety standards, provide clear labelling of both ingredients and side-effects. The agency will cover existing synthetic medicines as well as those considered as natural or alternative medicines.

Unfortunately /u/NEWSBOT3 is right, I'm afraid. Getting sponsored for a Tier 2 work visa is damn near impossible in this day and age. I think your idea of looking into multinational companies in the US with offices in the UK is reasonable. A Tier 2 intra-company transferee visa is a bit easier to get, although I still wouldn't call it 'easy' per se. Just look for any international company where you want to go - GE, Siemens, Coca-Cola, whatever. It doesn't matter where the company's head office is based or whether or not it's ""American"" - as long as you've worked for that company full-time in an office outside the UK for I believe two years, you can transfer to an office in the UK (assuming the company goes for that sort of thing). You might have to get creative with your search and make sure that the offices in Leeds/York actually provide the services you could ostensibly do in the US - there's no sense in applying for a job with a company in the US if the office in Leeds only works on HR and payroll, and their engineering teams are based in Reading.

Honestly, the only other thing I could recommend would be to research your ancestry. Have either you or your husband got any parents, grandparents or great-grandparents born in Europe? Some countries (Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Croatia, Spain and a few others) have very generous citizenship by descent laws and you might qualify for an EU passport without knowing it. Taking a non-EU spouse with you to an EU country (assuming one of you qualified) is remarkably easy. Definitely something to look into, especially if your parents or grandparents are from Europe. One of the only countries I know of with citizenship for great-grandchildren is Croatia, but have a look anyway.

**EDIT** Okay so I was sort of taking the piss when I mentioned Coca-Cola, but I've just done a search for mechanical engineering jobs in Leeds and (after filtering out all the bullshit agency postings) I see that Coca-Cola are actually hiring a ['reliability engineer'](http://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/reliability-engineer/26291864#/jobs/mechanical-engineer-in-leeds?direct=True) for their production centre in Wakefield, which is just south of Leeds. Now obviously that isn't mechanical engineering or product design, but I'm sure they hire for that. If you live anywhere near Atlanta, maybe see if he can get a job with them?

I would also recommend that you widen your scope for where you're willing to work. I would honestly be willing to be sent anywhere in the UK up until the point that you can get permanent residency, which is normally around five years. After that, move anywhere you want. I say that because so many good jobs right now are in and around London. For example, [here's a product design company](http://www.turnerduckworth.com/) in London (who are actually contracted by Coca-Cola Enterprises UK) that has its US office in San Francisco. Narrowing yourself to a specific occupation with a very specific company (multinational, presence in both UK and US) is limiting enough, but to focus on one part of the UK that's... not exactly the economic centre of the country... might be a bit of a stretch.",null,0,null,1421890845,null,0,1421891738,0,cnwqidf,null,t3_2t7gvv,null,t1_cnwqidf,null,t1_cnwezz6,null,null,null,1424474479,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

So how come [studies keep on finding](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/uks-healthcare-ranked-the-best-out-of-11-western-countries-with-us-coming-last-9542833.html) that the NHS is one of if not the most efficient health care system in the world?

The free market would seem to be the best wealth creation system yet devised but that doesn't mean that it's the best solution to every problem, such as how to deliver health care. 

&gt; But even so it's not necessarily about efficiency. It's purely about finances, and there's certainly choice available. People will have to choose between large tax increases to fund the ever-more costly NHS. With little hope of them ever coming back down significantly: some may indeed be happy with that, others may not. Or you transfer some of the financial burden to individuals which will probably cost most people less...i haven't particularly considered how it would work because I don't honestly know. But I would imagine that we'd keep things such as major surgery, long-term treatments and such completely free (ie; the most expensive things that would bankrupt those unfortunate enough to need them). And perhaps have a small insurance system for things such as broken arms and flu and whatnot (which is the majority of what the NHS has to deal with). 

So ""it's purely about finances"" but we shouldn't consider how efficient health care systems are at converting spending into health care? 

If you're young and healthy and like to pretend that you'll never get sick or old and don't intend to have kids and don't give a shit about your parents. Well then in those circumstance I guess opting for a less efficient system that will probably cost you less in the short term would seem to make sense. For those of us who accept the possibility of getting sick and old, want to reproduce... even from an entirely selfish point of view the NHS is wonderful and far preferable to a less efficient private system.",null,0,null,1421891478,null,0,false,0,cnwqvb2,null,t3_2t6geb,null,t1_cnwqvb2,null,t1_cnwpwwe,null,null,null,1424474312,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

The fact that a woman is topless in a newspaper isn't the offensive thing, it's the fact that it's just part of the sexism that tabloid culture embraces as a whole. Take the Daily Mail, for example, which equally shames and publicises practically any woman with a bit of cleavage, while the red tops in particular have a total lack of any male equivalent.

It's just another ingredient in what effectively functions as a way of making women more self conscious whilst depicting them as caricatured objects for men's pleasure. The NMP3 campaign is basically trying to tackle just a small part of the problem, because this entire ideology is pretty hard to try and take down all at once.

My personal problem with page three is that I can't think of a solid reason why it should stay, as it's negatives far outweigh the positives. And in a society where we now have a constant flow of arousing material online, it's certainly not necessary by any means to feature it on the inside cover of a newspaper, and as a country, we won't be missing out by not having this ""staple"" feature. Those that want to ogle at boobs everyday have plenty of outlets to do so for free, and I feel that their arguments for it to feature in this particular context fall flat as a result.

The quality in Europa is pretty strong, I'm not saying Saints couldn't, I just think it's a *very* long shot, and especially without a huge amount of depth, the longer we stay in Europe the heavier our schedule is throughout the year so a run in Europa could mean injuries (or at least fatigue) which could potentially hurt our chances of winning a cup we're more likely to win (FA Cup, League Cup) or remain in a place for Europe. 

Especially with the caliber of teams in Champions League, I just think it would be awesome to be in it! Imagine Saints paying at the Bernabeu or Camp Nou!!!

I'd argue that a new CB isn't nearly as important as a proper ball-playing CM who can dictate our play and hit vertical balls to bypass the first line of opposition defences.  For the last three seasons, our play through the middle has been frighteningly stagnant, and although it seems like Poch realises this by wanting Scheiderlin, we aren't getting him any time soon and yet the problem will persist.

We also need a CAM option who isn't Eriksen.  I realise Kane can play there, but since he's our only forward capable of scoring at the moment, I'd rather keep him upfront.  Lamela has the skills but I don't think is canny enough to play there, and Chadli is better utilised as a LW or second striker.

It's been said before, but we have too many players of okay-ish quality (Townsend and Lennon, Soldado and Adebayor, our entire centre midfield) who don't really offer enough outstanding qualities or performances to really demand a spot in the team.  Being alive in four competitions will kill us come mid-Feb, and yet there doesn't seem to be any impetus from the club to sign the players we need.

IIRC, one paper (I think either The Sun or the Mirror) had a page 7 male back as far as the 80s.

[Diet Coke Break](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdrE1VMxzoE) adverts scarcely raised an eyebrow, and an [advert for Carling lager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saoCaTlha8Y) showing a woman leading him around a house to clean a toilet with this tongue - was considered funny;  whereas a [Pot Noodle advert](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2403761/Pot-Noodle-advert-banned-comparing-spicy-snack-scantily-clad-woman.html) depicting a fully clothed woman dancing and then rolling up her top was banned for being ""crass and degrading"".

Firstly, I consider myself a feminist, and I'm male.

Secondly, to address that point, people shun feminism because of the wrong message portrayed by certain types of people who call themselves feminists. I 'affectionately' call them feminazis, although I think the word 'misandrists' is more PC and also accurate. The women who go round acting like men owe them the world because misogyny existed and still exists.

This is what I believe politics has been lacking for so long, none of the political parties have any _vision_ or ideology. They spend more time pandering for votes than they do implementing some sort of idea about what they see for the future.  
If I can summarise my editorial for what I imagine the respective visions of the parties are:  

* Tories: Keep things more or less the same, say popularist shit (tough on crime, tough on Europe) while slowly selling the country off to our friends. We represent old money and old interests while pretending to represent the public, in reality: fuck the public unless we need votes, in which case we'll say whatever you want.   
* Labour: same as the Tories now except they represent slightly newer money. They used to have ideals in regards to socialism but now they've mostly dropped them. Can occasionally be slightly socialist as some of their power base (the older part) is still into socialism.  
* Lib Dem: Keep things as they are, slightly tinker with them to attempt to make things more ""fair"". Try to change the political system at any point to gain more political power (as the present system favours two-party).  
* UKIP: Exactly the same as the Tories except they're into the ""easy answers"" of immigration being the source of our woes. They're founded by ex-Tory members who were disappointed by the Tory shift to the centre. Therefore they represent the older Tory mantra, think Enoch Powell.  
* Green: Actually have a fucking vision about how they want society to look and not scared to put it into writing.  

I'm by no means a Green supporter but I enjoyed reading the manifesto. Its not ""bonkers"" this is how politics used to be before the 90's where Labour and the Tories both merged into middle-of-the-road blandits. This is the Clinton era where soundbites and looking good are more important than being good at politics. You say nothing and mostly do nothing because saying things and doing things cost you votes.

&gt;__Joseph Carey Merrick__ (5 August 1862 – 11 April 1890), sometimes incorrectly referred to as __John Merrick__, was an English man with severe deformities who was exhibited as a [human curiosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freak_show) named the __Elephant Man__. He became well known in London society after he went to live at the [London Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_London_Hospital). Merrick was born in [Leicester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester), [Leicestershire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicestershire) and began to develop abnormally during the first few years of his life. His skin appeared thick and lumpy, he developed an enlargement of his lips, and a bony lump grew on his forehead. One of his arms and both feet became enlarged and at some point during his childhood he fell and damaged his hip, resulting in permanent lameness. When he was 10, his mother died and his father soon remarried. Merrick left school at 13, and had difficulty finding employment. Rejected by his father and stepmother, he left home. In late 1879, aged 17, Merrick entered the Leicester Union [Workhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workhouse).

You don't need to have big muscles to be a man, but you can be a man who has big muscles. You can be a man who doesn't have big muscles. It's not one or the other, nor are the terms interdependent. What I'm saying is that supporting equality for all *includes* feminism, and that feminism doesn't exclude all other forms of equality.

By supporting women's rights, for example, I don't refuse to support black people's rights, gay marriage and whatever else. It's just one of many things I support. I support men's rights too. I'm happy to call myself a feminist, and I'll most certainly continue to sigh and roll my eyes when some nutcase comes up with something about subjugating men because sexism used to be commonplace.

Here's what Smokey has said. And I agree, but not for the reasons Smokey has mentioned. You on the other hand are convinced Andros is playing like a wanker. Let's talk about that...

How the flying cock do you know what Andros is instructed to do? Has he been told to sit wide, run the by-line, cross in? Day in, day out? Has he been told to hold up the ball and only lay it off? Has he been told to give the kid in Row Z two black eyes? What do you know?

What absolutely drives me nuts in this sub is that we see Andros Townend playing inverted to his natural footing, and all our football managers expect and presume that his job is to be a traditional winger like Lennon. For all it matters to you, Poch could have told him, ""Right, put in a yard of pace on this RB, and once he is bloody well tired of chasing you up and down the pitch, have a cut inside if it's safe and see if you can pick out the netting."" 

The kid does it week in and week out, but for some reason Poch keeps putting him in the 11; so is Poch blind on his right and fired the interns who keep track of all these stats? Or is he convinced that it's going to come good?

A better criticism might be to suggest that he needs to up his practice on that particular technique, and that's what I'm cross about. The kid hasn't improved his ratio, which I expect. Stats don't show what he has been told, or instructed to carry out in 90 minutes.

Seems to me like male objectification most often takes the form of a man as a provider. The obvious example is in the case of gold-diggers, but it's actually more prevalent than is immediately obvious.

Watch pretty much any romantic comedy/Disney film aimed primarily at a female audience (not to mention romantic literature.. Twilight.. 50 shades..), and you'll find most of the time, the men serve simply as providers of some combination of strength, wealth, emotional affirmation, and usually beauty too. Take frozen (just because it's the one I've seen most recently), the men are effectively 1 dimensional tools who's purpose is to serve the women and look good doing it (or bad guys, though one is both..). 

But that's not to say the objectification of women is any less important. However, I think it is important to recognise that (the majority of) people do have fantasies of members of the opposite sex, and objectification gives content creators the opportunity to indulge those fantasies, as well as profit from doing so for others. 

I would say the problem isn't so much in the fact that women get objectified, but that more often than not they are defined by their gender. Usually even the most fleshed out and multi-faceted of female characters in media are undeniably women, whereas men are often just people. Which is why it's much harder to think of films with important/multiple female leads that could have the casts gender-reversed than visa versa (it's pretty trivial for men). I have no doubt that this both reflects and reinforces social attitudes towards women, and this to me seems like a far more damaging thing.",null,0,null,1421896124,null,0,false,0,cnwtfpa,null,t3_2t843y,null,t1_cnwtfpa,null,t1_cnwpg3b,null,null,null,1424473045,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

You also have to consider his situation. He's been essentially held like a prisoner there at Dnipro by an extremely wealthy owner who has turned down bids from Dinamo Kiev, Liverpool on his doorstep, and allegedly several German and Italian clubs. Despite all this, and despite everything Kono has proven for both club and country, he has been forced to stay there by this owner and third party ownership. I don't excuse any player not giving 100%, but you have to imagine that is very tough on a professional footballer's pscyhe and the needed motivation to continue consistently putting in top efforts. 

I think he'd be an excellent player in Poch's system. Extremely versatile, extremely unpredictable, extremely energetic, and gives excellent aggression in a press and transition to attack. The guy is absolutely ruthless, and never hesitates to run at his defender and get the ball forward. IMO, we could do with a bit of arrogance and will to have at it, as there are far too many instances of our attackers ducking responsibilities and passing sideways or putting in hopeful crosses.

Okay? Don't get your point here. So just because he doesn't get criticized by people don't watch the games, it's okay? What top team would be an upgrade to? Maybe Barcelona because they have no quality right wingers besides Pedro. He'd be good for a lot of teams just below the top tier like Spurs, but that's about it. 

&gt; Ofc there are better wingers in the world but I can't really understand where this attitude comes from that he needs to be swiftly replaced. Sickening sense of entitlement from new fans that we somehow deserve the worlds best in every position - have you honestly been watching the team for longer than 2 years?

Stop being so fucking sensitive and attacking an opinion because you disagree. ""You must be a dumb, new plastic fan because you don't like how one of our players are in games!!! God, you're so ENTITLED to think we should be getting a little bit more than 5 goals and 4 assists in 46 PL games from a £30m winger!!"" Stats don't mean everything but even on the eye test he has not done anything going forward. Seems like every time you provide a valid criticism of Willian's flaws during matches, people can only counter with vague responses that have no support. I didn't know expecting our starting right winger to do a little bit more than press aggressively and run a lot is me being entitled. Not exactly asking for a Reus or Bale here. Give me a break.

In the very first sentence I said I was, at the very least, perturbed they were making a chant about him just because of the way he looked. The racist claim is flimsy, but you are on about the ableist bit, but I don't really subscribe to that being a thing in regards to physical deformities i.e. genetic, loss of limbs, handicaps, because in society we have a standard of ability that maintains functionality. Changing the standards to meet the handicapped would arguably have more negatives than benefits.

What ""makes sense"" wasn't all that relevant. But that's no fun, so let's break it down anyway...

13 faces, 12 regenerations. As far as the general audience was concerned, it made enough sense (at the time) that Capaldi would be there, because Tennant's second regeneration wasn't confirmed yet to have ""counted"" until later. It would also make sense from the Time Lord's perspective (with the line ""No sir...all thirteen!) because they have no reason to know that one of his regenerations was spent on keeping the same face. So as far as they're concerned, Capaldi was his 13th and final face (or whoever; they have no reason to assume what order they're in).

Also, from the perspective of Doctors 1-8, War, and Tennant (if we just assume the Tennant in DotD is pre-Meta Crisis), Capaldi being there also makes sense. They'd have no reason to assume a regeneration was spent on keeping the same face, either. And obviously, from Capaldi's perspective, it makes sense because he already knows his own origins. So when his past selves come to recruit him to freeze Gallifrey, as far as those incarnations know, Capaldi is their final incarnation (and Capaldi would likely just go along with it). That would also ""explain"" why they don't go even further into the future to recruit even more Doctors, since they would all assume that Capaldi is their last life.


So really, the only person that should be completely baffled by Capaldi's presence would be Smith's Doctor. He already knows that he should be the last Doctor, but not yet far enough in his timeline to know he'll be granted a second set of regenerations. Also, he's the only Doctor after DotD to retain his memory of those events, so it makes it even more curious as to how he just seems to forget that there was another Doctor that he's not yet been. However, he WOULD know about Tennant's second regeneration, but probably to avoid a ton of questions and confusion from 10, he doesn't bother to recruit the ""second"" Tennant (why would he even need to?).


As far as Capaldi's Doctor though...the only way it would ""make sense"" is if Capaldi joined his previous incarnations without being recruited by them (since he had already lived those events and would know to go there). He swoops in just to give them all a hand, but doesnt communicate with any of them, and simply goes unnoticed by Smith's Doctor due to the chaos.

null,false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,null,"I sure hope so. There is an old Tomkins Times column (I'll have to try and find it somewhere) that brings about an interesting theory on transfers that really stuck with me; It's the idea that *if* 50% of incoming transfers in a particular window 'succeed' (with success being defined as a player who at least gets some regular playing time within the near future) then that window can been considered a resounding success.

Of course, that means 50% of those transfers can be deemed 'unsuccessful.' Furthermore, that 50% 'success' rate is a relatively ideal/optimistic number. Sometimes it's more, sometimes it's less.

[There was some degree of convincing data that supported this theory; A theory Tomkins Times admits isn't quite hard science but a good starting point]

Obviously it can take many seasons before you can judge someone as a 'success' or not.

Therefore, because of the percentage of 'success/not-a-success' and because of the time it could take for a player to prove themselves as a 'success' or not, the Tomkins Times column argued that we should *always* be active in a transfer window and move people in and out of the side. I believe in that theory as well.

So far, Suso seems to be the one 'major' outgoing-transfer and I really hope that we have at least a couple incoming transfers as well.

We may not be as wealthy as, say, Chelsea or Manchester City or Real Madrid or whatever and in spite of some frustration supporters have expressed about FSG, we are certainly not a poor club by any means.

Therefore, to me, I really think and hope that we should try our best to continue adding and subtracting to our squad.

Personally, I think we should:

* Sign a 'marquee' striker. I know, I know. Easier said than done. But Sturridge's injury troubles and the loss of Suarez exposed our side. I don't expect this, though. Options are limited, Champions League is not assured, and our recent success without Sturridge (along with his - and Lallana's! - impending return), a refreshed Raheem Sterling, the gradual emergence of Markovic, and the recall of Ibe (who certainly wasn't recalled to just sit on the bench) likely points to the fact that we will not get a striker unless one falls into our lap.
* GK. Yes, Mignolet has certainly seemed much steadier in recent weeks but Brad Jones' injury has left us very thin and Jones isn't necessarily the best option if Mignolet falters again. And, furthermore, it has been suggested that Mignolet may not have been Rodgers' first choice or the best GK for Rodgers' style of play. I think a GK (likely a young one for the future) could be on his way to Liverpool.
* Continue identifying and signing young players for the future.

Are these exciting moves? Maybe not. Are these moves that will make an immediate impact on the season? Well, unless we get That Striker, likely not.

However, again, I do subscribe to the theory that Tomkins Times has proposed and so I really do hope that we will make some signings.",null,0,null,1421912539,null,0,false,0,cnx0j0a,null,t3_2t9m8k,null,t1_cnx0j0a,null,t3_2t9m8k,null,null,null,1424469706,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

null,false,TheViagraKid,null,null,null,"&gt; I'd suggest this is a piss in the ocean in terms of solution.  

Hence why I said it's only a (very) short term solution. But it buys a little extra time to get firmer plans. 

&gt; * Increase in taxation by %.  

Yes, that's a possibility, in the medium term, but you can't keep increasing taxes forever. There comes a point when people will simply realise that they're being taxed far more than they'd ever spend on an insurance policy and public opinion will change (slowly I'm sure as many are pretty ignorant about these things), people will move abroad or simply start calling for tax cuts and re-organisation of the NHS.

* Increased immigration (as long as job opportunities increase inline)  

I'm not against an increase in immigration if it fills the skills gaps we have (because there's up to anything between a 3 to 21 year lag for filling them). But simply bringing in people because we have more jobs is foolish. We have lots of low skilled jobs available but bringing in more people from overseas to do them simply leaves more Brits jobless, on JSA or some other benefit (thus increasing the welfare bill, decreasing the potential amount of money which could go on the NHS). They also won't be contributing much, if any, tax/NI, which will almost certainly not offset the eventual cost to the NHS they create. 

* Cut other exponential spending such as pensions, either increase retirement age or cap pensionable age.

You could certainly do this in conjunction with efficiency savings in the NHS, and it would give more time to find a proper solution for sure. But again, as with taxes, there will come a time when you can't cut anymore because it would simply be unfeasible.

I agree they're also an issue. However pensions are many people's sole income once they retire, and I guess that politicians are reluctant to touch them, A) because they've already been changed a lot to reduce the government's financial burden, and B) because those who consider pensions to be more important are also more likely to vote.

&gt; The CPO ""prevents"" it by saying that if they move, they cannot keep the Chelsea name

No, they don't. CPO own the freehold of the stadium and leases it to the club. They also own the rights to the name Chelsea Football Club. The CPO does not ""say"" anything of the sort that the club could not keep the name, it just requires a 3/4 majority vote in favour of allowing the club to continue using the name if it moves from Stamford Bridge. This would happen if the club moved to, say, the Gas Works or Earl's Court or Battersea or probably Old Oak Common. It wouldn't happen if they moved to Essex. It is not a ""big deal"" at all, and has nothing to do with Battersea whatsoever. 

The reason that the vote didn't pass was because the Battersea plans were unrealistic. The mock ups of the ""stadium"" at Battersea were a cynical attempt by the board to wrestle back control of the name and, much more importantly, the freehold. Battersea would never have happened because the site was already sold, the costs of building a stadium around the carcass of the power station would have been utterly obscene, the club had ""ruled out"" expanding Stamford Bridge due to the  £600m cost, so paying nearly a billion for the land and redevelopment wasn't going to happen.

&gt; Other supporters are mocking us for not making any noise. And it's true. It's sort of pathetic when you think about it. Many home games I've seen on TV

Idiot. United fans are criticised for making no noise. Liverpool fans are. Arsenal fans are. City are a fucking embarrassment! 

So you're basing your opinion of our atmosphere based on watching games on the television. Brilliant. How many cup semi finals have we played at home so far this year? The atmosphere at a knockout game is generally excellent. 

Away fans always make a lot of noise, home fans don't make a great deal in straightforward league games. It's the same for every club. Except Palace.

The old days of ""jobs for life"" have gone, and have almost certainly no chance of coming back in the foreseeable future.

Those jobs were symptomatic of a demand for unskilled labour though and it's unlikely any modern business would operate using large numbers of unskilled people.

So in that sense the ""working class"", referring to the unqualified and unskilled manual labouring workers and their families, is just as much of an anachronism as ""peasants."" It's a class that doesn't exist any more.

I don't know what exactly to call the legions of badly paid semi-skilled workers doing precarious work like call centres and telesales.

A woman's breasts are far more than that; ask anyone who has to go through a mastectomy. What a ridiculous comment to make.

&gt;Much better if women were not so extremely sexualised at all so that a nipple wouldn't be a big deal.

Is the best way to achieve that by hiding nipples away, making sure they're always *private* and arguably *embarrassing* things? ""No, no, Timothy/Olivia, don't cast your gaze upon those harmful nipples. Not until you're at prep school.""

&gt;Much better to have children to just buy whatever softcore, objectifying piece of crap they want

What's objectifying about it? It's not even softcor; it's literally a woman standing with her breasts exposed. There's no suggestive tongue, no come-hither finger, no phallic props. Just a woman smiling without a top on. It's a pleasant scene.

Oh right yeah, it's Page 3 that's got front-to-back analysis on how to lose weight with fad diets, how to cure cellulite, how to groom, how to smell, what clothes to buy, yada yada yada.

As for Olympians, why should the unobtainable physical pinnacle of exclusive athletes be admired? 99.99% of people can't achieve it, yet we're meant to admire them? Sounds awfully similar to a crude feminist argument about objectification. Objectifying people for their physical properties...

null,false,MrJohz,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,null,"So this is based off the case of a friend - there might be differences in circumstance, but from what I understand it's fairly common for the process to work like this.

When you arrive in the UK and seek asylum, you'll be given accomodation and various resources such as food benefits, until the trial occurs.  During this time, you need to report to the authorities every week or so.  If the asylum request fails, then you are allowed to stay in the country, but you still need to report to the authorities.  Pretty much at any point from now onwards, when you go to report, you can be put on a plane and sent back.  Most of the time, this won't happen, and you'll be able to lodge an appeal and attempt to fight the deportation.  Around this time, you may also be asked to leave government-provided accomodation.  This isn't always true, but it can be.  You can also be moved around the country largely on a whim.  The amount of notification you'll get for this varies, but suffice it to say that you're not really in anyone's best interests at this point.

Of course, there's always the chance that these things might *not* happen, and that you'll stay in limbo long enough for an appeal to be made and for you to be allowed to stay.  I know a person who has been in the process of amassing diplomas over the past couple of years in order to transfer just some of the qualifications he had in his home country to the British system.  This is all while signing up to say that he hasn't fled every month, and hoping that it won't be the last time.  And trying to cope with the legal case that's being waged around him.

This is all to say nothing of how you can flee from a country that has claimed the lives of your friends and forced your family into hiding in another country and still be refused asylum, in no small part because lawyering is not the sort of cheap thing that anyone living of food stamps can get hold of.

Because he's ***17***. Not even Gerrard had a first team appearance at that age. The fact that he even made his debut is a massive plus!

~~As for Alberto~~ The one thing one must understand about academy players is that they are not scouted. This means that you get whatever personalities, attitudes and mentalities you can think of coming through provided they have the ability to play. 

Of course you try and sculpt them as much as you can, but I'm sure Inter didn't make Balotelli the nut-job he is. That's just who he is.

As such you will get some extremely talented players coming through who don't have the character you want in a first team player. And there you have a choice - do you ignore that aspect or do you let them go and find someone else who has what you want?

Suso lacked graft. I don't mean he didn't work hard in training because I have no idea, but I do know that he wasn't prepared to wait for his chance the way Hendo, Lucas, Markovic, Skrtel, Sakho, Sterling, etc, etc did. Hell Luas went through two seasons of Rodgers before he got his chance in the first team and he has never complained once.

Talent isn't everything. Sometimes that means we let players go and we don't understand why. Sometimes we will make the wrong decisions.

This all depends on how you view immigration whether a drain on resources or a net gain for the economy. I think generally speaking people prefer to work than be on benefits and jobs are not finite resource but more a product of people (the service industry especially).  
Specifically the need for immigration is to retain our age pyramid of those of working age outstripping those of pensionable age.

2 years paid leave for parents? There would be mothers that could spend 4+ years on solid paid leave (imagine having to keep a job open for that length of time, not knowing when they might return, as a small business). 

&gt;New resource taxes would apply to wood, metal and minerals, and steeper levies imposed on cars.

Good job, you've destroyed all manufacturing in this country overnight!

&gt;Crucially, import taxes will be levied on goods brought to Britain reflecting the “ecological impact” of making them – with tariffs reintroduced for trade between Britain and the rest of Europe, ending the free trade bloc.

This would not only be illegal, other countries would introduce their own tariffs for UK goods in retaliation. This was one of the leading causes of the Great Depression in the USA. 

&gt;All elements of the sex industry will be decriminalised, and prostitutes could no longer be discriminated against in child custody cases.

And their plans for the massive influx of vulnerable being sold into sex slavery that occurs when prostitution is legalised?

&gt;SATS, early years tests and league tables will be abolished, and “creative” subjects given equal parity to the “academic”.

You think arts degrees are worthless for the workplace? you wait until you have people that have gone their entire academic lives with arts replacing core subjects! Then there's a time bomb of schools not being able to prove or show that they're bringing up generations of children lacking in core skills and have a lack of general knowledge as arts replace humanities and sciences.

&gt;Independent schools will lose their charitable status and pay corporation tax, while church schools will be stripped of taxpayer funding. Religious instruction will be banned in school hours.

Independent school fees rise, making them even more elitist and they stop offering scholarships. Banning religion in school just creates a more segregated society and makes people more fearful. France is a secular society but religious tensions are far worse than they are here.

&gt;The England football, rugby and cricket teams would no longer play against countries where “normal, friendly, respectful or diplomatic relations are not possible.” Football clubs would be owned by co-operatives and not traded on the stock markets.

The England football, rugby, cricket and probably Olympic teams would be banned from all international competitions as a result. The ownership scheme would destroy clubs and cause decades of court battles. Owners like the Glazers would sooner asset strip Man U than hand it over to the fans.

&gt;No more new airports or runways will be built, and existing ones nationalised. All new homes and businesses must by law provide bicycle parking. Helicopter travel would be regulated “more strictly”. The sale of alcohol on planes and airports will be tightly restricted to prevent air-rage, and the air on inbound flights tested for disease.

Good luck ever getting any private company to ever invest in infrastructure projects in the UK ever again. 

Air on inbound flights to be tested for disease? That's frankly just batshit insane. Ignoring the costs involved, what are the passengers supposed to do in the days-weeks it'll take for the air to be tested for a bunch of diseases? Are we going to force all visitors to be holed up in quarantine accommodation for a week upon arrival?

&gt;Advertising of holiday flights will be controlled by law to halt the “promotion of a high-carbon lifestyle”. New taxes would be imposed on carriers to reduce passenger numbers.

We don't need those tourist billions anyway!

&gt;Assisted dying will be legalised, and the law on abortion liberalised to allow nurses to carry it out. “Alternative” medicine will be promoted. Private healthcare will be more heavily taxed, with special levies on private hospitals that employ staff who were trained on the NHS.

Abortion law is generally fine in the UK as it is. 'Alternative medicine' is a joke (the whole ""it'll be regulated"" will just mean that things are certified as being genuine, not that they only allow things with proven medicinal benefits). Levies on employing NHS staff? NHS trained staff will go overseas (in even larger numbers) and we'll have to ship in even more EU staff.

&gt;In order to prevent “overpopulation” burdening the earth, the state will provide free condoms and fund research for new contraceptives.

We already have free contraceptives available from a variety of sources.

&gt;Merely being a member of al-Qaeda, the IRA and other currently proscribed terrorist groups will no longer be a criminal offence under Green plans, and instead a Green Government should seek to “address desperate motivations that lie behind many atrocities labelled ‘terrorist’,” the policy book states.

Congratulations, the UK is now a massive hotbed of extremism with no need to even hide it. What exactly are we supposed to do about Islamic groups angry about Palestine? Even if we're angels internationally, people will come to the UK angry at other countries' foreign policy. I'm sure the US and co. would love us being a primary exporter of extremists.

&gt;Britain will leave NATO, end the special relationship with the US, and unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons. A standing army, navy and airforce is “unnecessary”. Bases will be turned into nature reserves and the arms industry “converted” to producing windturbines.

200,000 people directly out of jobs from armed forces. 1.2million people rely on the arms industry for a living. Instant severe recession.

The UK becomes completely irrelevant internationally, the Falklands get conquered by Argentina and we're reliant on the allies we've just turned our backs on to protect us.

The south becomes even more overpopulated!

&gt;Access to benefits, the right to vote and tax obligations will apply to everyone living on British soil, regardless of passport.

While innovation is strong in R&amp;D, there really is no point in bringing that quagmire of restrictions, complex insurance policies and payments to this country.  I think most people would be happy to pay more NI if that's what it would take to make up for any budget shortcomings.  

The sad thing is I think the NHS could also save a lot of money if the right kind of tech people were brought on board to look at processes and introduce decent systems.  Then that money could be put into paying for staff, facilities and equipment.  However the track record of NHS computer systems shows this would more than likely get fucked up.

I've had a few experiences with the NHS and got to see one of the best sides of it when I had a bit of cancer, and apart from much interminable waiting, things were good due to how well it was funded.  

Not that's is a useful sentiment but Farage can do one.

- Lovren/defense was shit, we switched to a back 3 and (finally &amp;amp; thankfully) introduced Can and Sakho into the starting rotation. Problem solved.

- We needed a defensive mid because Gerrard's form wasn't up to par and Rodgers wasn't happy with Can there either so Lucas ended up claiming that spot all to himself and has been boss. Problem solved.

- We needed ""ready"" &amp;amp; ""proven"" attacking players and didn't have time to wait for out young talents like Sterling and Markovic to develop into top players. But those two along with Lallana and Coutinho have since stepped up their quality and confidence and are firing as of late. Not to mention the implementation of Moreno/Enrique and Manquillo as out and out wingbacks with their pace. Problem solved.

- We need a clinical striker who has a killer instinct in front of goal. With Sturridge back to full fitness (or at least as full as Sturridge can possibly be) we should have the kind of striker we've been needing in him. Unfortunately the time it takes to really see if he lives up to his potential January will be over and the window will have been kind closed. Problem hopefully solved.

I disagree, I think its a waste of time and focus that ultimately does little to solve the underlying issue which is what I find so frustrating about ""the rise of UKIP"".  They quibble about the drop of water that forces the glass to overflow as opposed to focusing on the capacity of the glass or the reason why its so full in the first place.

&gt; Yes, that's a possibility, in the medium term, but you can't keep increasing taxes forever.

You don't need to keep increasing taxes forever, just find a % point that pays for what we consume. Specifically I feel that our capital gains tax should be brought inline with income tax rates.  

&gt;  But simply bringing in people because we have more jobs is foolish. We have lots of low skilled jobs available but bringing in more people from overseas to do them simply leaves more Brits jobless, on JSA or some other benefit (thus increasing the welfare bill, decreasing the potential amount of money which could go on the NHS). They also won't be contributing much, if any, tax/NI, which will almost certainly not offset the eventual cost to the NHS they create.

This entire paragraph demonstrates the problem with the discourse in the UK at the moment. The ""cost"" of immigration and the cost of JSA is simply irrelevant in comparison to the total welfare bill. You're also trying to make out that immigrants won't contribute enough to cover their costs even though recent studies have shown that immigrants typically deliver a net benefit to the UK economy.

I would argue that it is only reasonable to expect that the male models would be topless and therefore not naked. Tits are in a funny zone that is neither non-nudity or full-frontal nudity, where as mens chests are not given that status.

null,false,negotiationtable,null,null,null,"You'll get most cost effectiveness if you run all this infrastructure shit as non-profit.

If you are cleaning wards, or windows, or preparing food, or maintaining roofs, there's people that need to be paid to do that.  The government is a big enough organisation that it can create small sub-organisations that are run well to do this stuff, and keep costs down.  One reason we have spiralling costs is that many companies get NHS contracts and extract money before paying their employees.  Which is fine, it is why people start companies.  However I don't consider it the duty of the NHS to breathe life into these companies.  It seems wasteful to do so.  The more vertical integration one has in the NHS, the more one can reap economies of scale.  It's my belief that it would be less effort to create organisations to handle all the work of a hospital, from construction, wiring, facilities, infrastructure, maintenance, cleaning, than to put everything out to tender, inspect, etc.  

To outsource you've got to do this:

1. scope the work
2. put it out to tender
3. review responses
4. assess suitability
5. establish governance processes
6. negotiate
7. hire
     7.1 at this point the contracted company has to start hiring
     7.2 establish codes of conduct
     7.3 train
     7.4 invoice and profit
     7.5 pay
     7.6 schedule
8. inspect work
9. pay

and I imagine that's just a small part of the activities.  Surely this overhead would be reduced by directly doing the work at hand?  Rather than paying the administrators to oversee the tender and governance and invoicing and standards, the company itself to provide the service, and the employee, we should pay the administrators for the service in house and the employees for the service?  Likely without the overhead the pay could go towards hiring good people and carefully thought through incentives.

Despite best efforts with the system of outsourcing, there's nothing complex about cleaning wards, windows, etc.  If there was it would be much more difficult to outsource.  You'll likely get the same individuals anyway doing the job, only now they are your employee instead and you can control their training and quality of work directly, instead of having to complain to your service provider, who then fights their corner etc.  

One used to have janitorial staff to do these things.  One could imagine a government facilities organisation whose task is to do all this across all hospitals.  The only difficulty is they need to be run well, with people that believe in saving the taxpayer money as well as doing the best job they can, taking pride in their job.

Interview was with some wannabe flash cunt with a massive shiny forehead. At no point in the interview was the substance of the job discussed and most of my questions were evaded. Naturally, like everyone does, I got the ""job"".

Every morning, it was like a cult meeting. People whooping and clapping, standing in circles in ill-fitting suits, 'motivating' each other not to be a 'neg head', before being sent out all over the country to ""pitches"" that the owner had selected. We paid all of our own travel costs (around Scotland), got no basic wage, 60-72+hr weeks and none of the freedom of being 'self-employed' as we supposedly were. I met some of the most loathsome characters I've every met in my life there - and we'd constantly be sent to ""pitches"" where the populace was poor, vulnerable and mostly elderly and encouraged to hard sell as much as possible.

Basically, the structure of these places is:

Owner (who also pays up the pyramid to his ""owner"" who promoted him);
Leaders (most people get to this level. They have deductions from their contracts taken by their owner, are enticed with the carrot of starting their own marketing company with their owners help, but it's largely a pipe dream);
Drones (Noobs and those who don't buy into the hype)

They also have a 'bond' system where you only receive half of what each sign-up is worth, with the other half being paid if the customer doesn't cancel within 3 months.

Basically, if you're skint, don't take a job there - you will not make enough to justify 6 day weeks, 12 hour days, or the whooping cultist bullshit each and every morning bar the Sunday you get off. Even if you get 4 sales in a day to 'ring' your 'bell', that's like £60 for a 12 hour day, minus your travel costs, food, etc.

So if the premise of their persecution is their supposed homosexuality, how should we ascertain if their fear is legitimate?

&gt;We saw at the UEA-UKIP debates sudents in their Tweenies tear apart the two UKIP candidates

You say you saw a debate with two UKIP candidates. Well how highly do you regard the opinions of political candidates? Anyone can be a candidate. 

If you think the views of a couple of candidates is worth so much, with what regard do you take the view of an MP, and shadow member of the cabinet? Surely much, much higher. So what do you think when Diane Abbot, who held that position, says something like this?:

&gt;""White people like to play divide and rule, black people should not play their games""

If you think so strongly about the opinions of a couple of UKIP candidates, you  must think even more strongly about what Diane Abbot said. If you think those candidates represent UKIP, then Abbot must represent Labour correct? What abbot said is, in my opinion much more racist that anything I have heard UKIP say. Much more likely to cause division in society. And it was said by a much more senior member of the party. So why do you consider UKIP racist but not Labour?

Person from Skye here!  That's bollocks.

If you're driving it would take someone who knows the roads, allowing for traffic and the new (evil) average speed cameras on the A9 5-6 hours to drive from Edinburgh to Skye, so I'd allow eight as a tourist (more if you want to stop anywhere).  If you take the bus from Glasgow it's, from memory, about seven to eight hours as well.

One option for you, depending on budget, might be to take a tour with one of the local companies who take a minibus up to the Highlands with groups.  Even at this time of year they offer a service.  I know a friend who went in October (hey, /u/wee-pixie can you help with your experience?) up to Skye for a couple of days and although the weather was awful I think it wasn't *hugely* expensive given that all accommodation was included.  

If you're renting a car/van, don't underestimate the cost of petrol as it's significantly higher up north.

IIRC there's a car hire company in Skye who will pick you up in Armadale - you could then take the train from Glasgow to Mallaig - regularly quoted as [among the best train trips in the world](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/journeysbyrail/9907006/Glasgow-to-Mallaig-Great-Train-Journeys.html), the ferry to Skye and be met by a hire car that you could then use to explore the island.",null,0,null,1421924034,null,0,false,0,cnx2yua,null,t3_2t6dnb,null,t1_cnx2yua,null,t1_cnw8zvj,null,null,null,1424466913,null,5,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,5,null

Strictly speaking I believe you're wrong, there's no legal grounds (maybe as Asbo) that can stop someone from riding a bike. But anyway, my point is we all have a right to hop on a bike and use it. What we do after that fact is open to debate :)


&gt;transferring the risk to cyclists onto pedestrians instead is not a suitable alternative

Oh I agree, its far from suitable

&gt;Between 2005 and 2009, ten pedestrians were killed and 262 seriously injured by cyclists. That figure would not improve if cycling on pavements were permitted

There are a couple of points to be made here - 1st I agree with you.

But I do take a slightly different view - hypothetically you could argue I think more lives could be saved if cyclists used the pavement. 1st off the normality of the act would acclimatize pedestrians to it. And 2nd over 100 cyclists lives each year would be saved each year. So while im sure more pedestrians would be hurt, I have no doubt that as a whole more lives would be saved.

Of course more lives would also be saved if we punished motorists more, lowered speed limits and generally changed the attitudes on the roads. Which is in my opinion the better option.

Or cycle lanes... :)

&gt;it's simply true.

So if you think it is ok to make such sweeping generalised xenophobic statements I assume you wouldn't complain about the following statements:

""Muslims are terrorists who hate the west""

""Black people are thieves""

Diane Abbots comments are just as inappropriate as these. And your willingness to blame all white people for the crimes of a few makes you yourself a racist, no matter what the colour of your skin.

The fact that you cannot see this really makes your comments about UKIP irrelevant. You will attack one party for begin racist, even though none of their policies are explicitly racist, yet you will defend an actual racist comment, presumably because you believe that racism is only possible by certain races, which again in itself is racist. 

There is a huge amount of hypocrisy in your views, how you can consider your view to be better than those of the average UKIP supporter I do not understand.

Do your job.  Do it well.  Do it *so* well that you make your manager look good.

Get every task done correctly and ahead of time.  Then ask for more work.

Prove to your manager that you've got a brain and that you're not there just to do grunt work.

If you've finished your work - make a round of tea for the office and then ask people if you can help them.  Ask to shadow them.  Take notes.  Learn.

You have an opportunity ahead of you - as you've realised.  You can squander it by doing the minimum amount necessary to not get fired.  That leads to a life of fairly crappy jobs.

null,false,2econdclasscitizen,null,null,null,"A couple of initial things to bear in mind: 

- everyone has an amount they can pass on to their nominated beneficiaries free of inheritance tax (IHT). This is called the nil rate band and it's currently £325,000. 

- no IHT liability arises where property passes between spouses when one dies. 

- nil rate bands of spouses can be combined (so the last spouse to die can pass on £650,000 to their nominated beneficiaries free of inheritance tax). 

So, if the combined estate of your grandparents is less than £650,000, there shouldn't be an IHT liability to worry about. 

Assuming this is not the case, here are the basics. IHT is complicated, so if you're in doubt, a tax lawyer or financial adviser could be worthwhile. 

Most transfers of ownership of property (including money) from one person to another become, for inheritance tax purposes, what are known as Potentially Exempt Transfers (PETs). A transfer becomes 'exempt' 7 years from the date the transfer is made. After this period has passed, the property transferred falls outside the estate of the transferor and no IHT will be payable on it. 

**The quick answer to your question is this.** If any property transferred (including money) is returned to the transferor, ownership of that property would revert back to the transferor. This would cause it to form part of the transferor's estate if they died without transferring it from their ownership again. 

It should also be remembered that for a transfer of property to meet the requirements of a PET, the transferor has to genuinely give up their rights to and control over the property. 'Gifts with reservation of benefit' (as they are known) will not start the 7 years, and the property will remain in the estate until 7 years from the date that rights/control were forfeited. An example is transferring a home to someone but continuing to live in it without paying market rent. 

In your situation, if the beneficiary of your grandparents' money were to allow the grandparents to use some of the money they transferred, HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs might not consider the initial transfer to have met the PET requirements on the basis that your grandparents 'reserved a benefit'. A successful challenge would result in all or part of the money falling into the estate and - subject to allowances etc - being subject to IHT. 

There are are some more complications as well (albeit positive ones!): 

- a person is entitled to (irrevocably) gift up to £3,000 a year which will fall outside their estate immediately and not attract an IHT charge

- if a transfer is potentially exempt, depending on the circumstances, after 3 years the IHT rate that applies decreases incrementally each year until the 7 years pass, so less tax is payable the longer the time that's passed since the transfer. Here's a link to a more detailed explanation (and I expect the site will be helpful in relation to IHT more generally - http://taxaid.org.uk/guides/information/other-taxes-you-may-need-to-know-about/inheritance-tax/828-2/taper-relief-for-lifetime-gifts

But he doesn't come across as a guy new players look to for guidance, you know? Also, he isn't in a position to drag the team forward when we need it, or carry us over the finish line when we're up 1-0 at Old Trafford and flagging. And this is something we're missing, I think.

Westwood isn't a bad shout either, and arguably gives the team a more proactive focus than if we give the armband to the keeper... but he's a bit understated. And I don't get the impression that the new guys look to him either. Similarly, Clark just seems the captain type. He's the guy you want on your side when the shit hits the fan... but he still needs to mature a bit. Can't afford to have the captain getting himself sent off when we need him.

As things stand, I think we kind of have to resign ourselves to the fact that this squad lacks leader figures that we can really rely on week-in, week-out. The closest we have to that is Guzan, IMO. And that's why I'd make him captain.

Could make a case for Westwood or Clark though. The responsibility might force them to improve somehow, change their game and adapt. I'm not sure.

Personally, if you insist on stealing cars and endangering lives, then your fair game for vigilantes.  Each time I hear of these punishments locally, they aren't wrong.  They're careful about capping someone and they get plenty of warnings and it's not til the community is crying out for someone to stop it that they use force.

Again, your inability to recognise  the fact that you are doing what you accuse UKIP members of doing, and in fact going beyond into outright racism, is astounding, and makes your criticism of UKIP totally hypocritical.

Of course some groups of people are better off, or more privileged than others. Why do you think that gives you the right to make racist statements about ALL white people.

And how do ""whites"" have that power? Is it something innate within white people? In which case how do you explain the oppression of white people in south Africa?

&gt;WR350 We will introduce the following system of parental leave. ""Parent"" is defined as a person who takes parental responsibility for a child.

&gt;i .Each parent will be entitled to one month of post-natal leave immediately after the birth or adoption of a child, recognizing the importance of early bonding with the child, and in the case of the birth mother, the need for recovery time.
&gt;
&gt;ii. Every employee should be eligible for parental leave after 3 months service.
&gt;
&gt;iii. In addition, a further total of 22 months of paid leave will be available. This may be shared between two parents, with the parent taking the lesser period of time having to take a minimum period of six months. Should that parent choose to take less than that, it will not be available to the other parent, except in the case of a single parent where no other person is taking parental responsibility for the child, in which case the sole parent can take the full 22 months.

The closest thing to a full 2 years leave for a worker would be for single parents, who would be entitled to a full 23 month paid leave. Otherwise, a couple would technically be allowed a full 24 months between them (1 month immediately for each, 22 months total between them after that).",null,0,null,1421927350,null,0,1421927577,0,cnx3n7j,null,t3_2t9y0m,null,t1_cnx3n7j,null,t1_cnx38x6,null,null,null,1424466596,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I find the proposal offensive on a number of levels that surprises me.

Mounting some cloth up on a flagpole won't fucking do that. It's a singularly craven sort of tokenism.

Speak for yourself, you pompous cunt (*Edit: The author- not you, Joe!*). ""Born of another time""? It's a consensus that's developed over multiple decades. That it offends your precious patrician sensibilities has no bearing on the fact that *society at wide* finds the idea of flying a flag as a tokenistic gesture all the time vulgar as all hell.

I don't know about you but I think that, objectively speaking, getting hit by a car is worse for someone than being hit by a bike. Perhaps you disagree.

&gt;From from us passing the problem to someone else, it's not our problem in the first place! I am not going to put myself at risk of being hit because road users can't work out how to co-exist without killing each other.

So, again, you would rather the cyclist got hit by a car than you, at the very worst, getting a minor injury. Because it is not, in your own words, your problem. Surely it's about minimising the risks and making it as safe as possible for everyone? Putting cyclists on the pavement doesn't eliminate risk entirely, but the result of any collision in that situation is far less lethal (car-bike vs bike-person). Am I wrong in thinking this?

I personally wouldn't mind the small risk of getting hit by a bike if it meant that it saved people's lives in the long run.

It's for my parents, they will be retiring in 5 years and just want to maximise their savings in that time but they very likely will not entertain the idea of anything outside of a current account, an ISA and a savings account!

With that in mind, I'm thinking of the following. 

£20000 into a Santander 123 account and this is to be used for their current account. 

Transfer to 1.5% NS&amp;I Isa and top up to £15,000 and put in £15,240 after April 5th. 

Remainder into highest normal savings account I find and the £1k a month goes into that. Transfer into ISA in new financial year to continue ISA topping up!

It's not glamorous or exciting but there we are!

What do you think?

Yet it's perfectly ok to see breasts printed in the paper. Do children never get access to newspapers, or not allowed to buy them? Do sensitive people who are afraid of breasts never read The Sun?

As a heterosexual male, I'd like to see a lot more breasts*. However, I'd like to see the women who possess them be absolutely free to display them as and when they wish, and not only on condition that they're displayed solely to sell newspapers.

Alternatively, I'd like to see consistency shown the other way. Where breasts cannot legally be proven to exist in public, can we keep that Schroedinger's Tit situation in the papers too?

More for those who earn more and less for those who earn less.  A normal progress tax system to provide universal health coverage for every man woman and child in the United Kingdom.

&gt;There are ways of being more effecient which mean a lower standard of care.

I agree, but I don't think that the way is the turn it into an insurance based system or to let the market get more involved.

&gt;So how long does it take to see a specialist in the Netherlands? How quickly are you turfed out of hospital in the Netherlands? What limits are there on the quality and costs of drugs and treatments in the Netherlands? Can you in fact get cheaper insurance in the Netherlands because you don't smoke or you go to the gym?

**In a developed country like ours, no human should be able to die or suffer unnecessarily from a curable or preventable disease.**

Now, if you disagree with this statement, then the debate stops right there, because we have a difference in basic moral principle that *nothing* will be able to change. Your choice in basic moral imperative will lead you down a specific logical path, and if you don't believe in this same one, then you will not follow the same logical path.

But assuming that you agree with that statement, the logical and inevitable consequences of privatisation will always run counter to that moral imperative:

* If healthcare requires payment to be administered, then by definition, there will be people who will not be able to afford it. They will suffer and die. This cannot be allowed.

* If we have competing private providers of healthcare, then obviously, their level of quality will differ, even in the same location. More expensive ones will have better quality and treatment. Some people with the lesser companies will suffer and die of curable diseases only because of their company choice. This cannot be allowed.

* Even if we have income-based regulations on insurance costs, what if someone refuses or for some reason does not pay their premium, or perhaps has voided their insurance due to some technicality? They will be left to suffer and die. This cannot be allowed.

* None of the above issues will matter to a private company, since the only motive is profit. They will make a huge profit no matter how many people die who don't need to die. You cannot fault a private company for doing what it is designed to do.

its utter idiocy. 

fwiw - you think it doesn't count but it does. the anti iraq protests did not stop the iraq war but they created an environment where going to war again was much more carefully considered and subsequently we have had far more limited involvement in military actions overseas, and parliament is being consulted every time (this directly stopped syria military action). Additionally the occupy wall street movement did not directly affect any laws - but it has placed the 1% concept front &amp; center of the minds of everyone and is now a conversation that is happening every week. If your local Labour MP sees his or her majority sliding towards other parties that will start to reflect on that and may find themselves better representing their policies, or moving the party policy. 

it all counts - however small - and it can ONLY count if you take the quite frankly extremely easy steps to get involved. 

no other system is going to come along to make your opinion count more - you have to accept that the world works by trying to add up everyones - and you should be one of them.

* **AR424 To abolish zoos and private collections of animals except where they are for the benefit of the animal concerned. Licences will only be granted to establishments involved in either captive breeding of endangered species for eventual return to the wild or else those offering genuine sanctuary to animals unable, through injury and other cause, to be returned to the wild and where their living conditions are as close as possible to the animal's natural habitat.**

No more London Zoo. 

* **CJ381 Recognising the nature of the female prison population, with high levels of mental illness, experience of being a victim of crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence, and caring responsibilities for children, the only women who should be in custody are those very few that commit serious and violent crimes and who present a threat to the public.** 

Women can do no wrong. 

* **EC730 A Citizen's Income sufficient to cover an individual's basic needs will be introduced, which will replace tax-free allowances and most social security benefits (see EC711). A Citizen's Income is an unconditional, non-withdrawable income payable to each individual as a right of citizenship. It will not be subject to means testing and there will be no requirement to be either working or actively seeking work.**

Citizens income is almost certainly unworkable in normal conditions. But when paired up with this next policy it becomes completely unworkable. 

* **MG205 Migration policies should not discriminate directly on grounds of race, colour, religion, political belief, disability, sex or sexual orientation. Preference should not be given to those with resources or desirable skills.**

* **EC405 Interest rates on the lending of money should be capped at a reasonable rate linked to the Bank of England interest rate. Any money lent should always be preceded by sufficient credit checks. When sufficient credit checks are not undertaken the Office of Fair Trading should have the power to deliver severe penalties** 

Banks literally aren't allowed to make a profit on loans any more. Counterparty risk doesn't exist in the make believe fairytale land that the Greens apparently live their lives..

* **EC658 We will gradually establish legal ways for companies to be transformed into mutual organisations, such as consumer or worker cooperatives in specified circumstances if a sufficient majority of the relevant workers or customers agree. Existing shares will be converted into non-voting equity or loan stock. One important initial circumstance when this might be done is upon the sale of a small business or upon the death or retirement of the owner. Another initial application might be to football or other sporting clubs where a majority of the season ticket holders, supported by the wider local community, might want to bring a local club into mutual ownership. In the longer run we would envisage some process of this kind applying, with appropriate safeguards, to all companies.**

Literally communism. 

* **EC663 The existing banking system has failed and is no longer fit for purpose. The Green Party believes that the power to create money must be removed from private banks. The supply of our national currency must be fully restored to democratic and public control so that it can be issued free of debt and directed to environmentally and socially beneficial areas such as renewable energy, social housing, or support for community businesses.**

So when the Greens aren't in, any old government can print money whenever they want. Deficit? What deficit? I just printed £150bn and now the deficit is gone. Praise me, people of the UK. I am the greatest leader. 

* **PD302 On inspection, there is little or no threat of direct invasion of the UK by any nation. Commitment to a large standing army, a navy of large warships around our coastline, squadrons of fighter planes and a cripplingly expensive missile defence system is therefore unnecessary. Any threat of invasion that might arise in the future is so remote that realignment of the UK military and defence preparations would be possible long before any invasion occurred.**

Okay, I can see where you're coming from. It's an extremely naive view of the world, but okay.. Oh, wait.. What's this conflicting policy:

* **PD312 The Green Party is committed to the early conversion of economic, scientific and technological resources presently used to support the arms race, to socially useful and productive ends. Some military training areas should be decommissioned and used as nature reserves, with suitable provision for access by the public.**

So after completely dismantling our military and military industry they expect us to rebuild our military and military industry from scratch. 

Russia/Ukraine escalated in mere months, for example. Things can move incredibly quickly. And if you know that your enemy was completely defenceless why on earth would you wait and let them build their military back up before attacking? You wouldn't. 

I'm bored of looking through their idiotic policies section. This was just me skimming it. There's much more bollocks in there. 

They're completely authoritarian and they wish to write authoritarianism into law, while still remaining a democratic nation. So while the Greens might use their dumb as fuck laws in a nice manner, what happens when they get kicked out?

Get the best ISA rate you can, and maximise that. Then for each person split 40k into 2, and fill your santander account up (this will require 2 direct debits in each account and monthly transfers - but there are dozens of ways around this, charity, alternate current accounts swinging money around etc). This will generate £80 a month, £960 a year :). Each year top up your ISA as much as possible (similar to what you've said already). The 1k monthly you should really put into another high interest current account rather than any old account; nationwide and TSB have good interest rates and their minimum monthly payment is less than 1k).

The santander account is great for amounts upto 20k, then they start falling behind an ISA.

This is basically the model I've adopted for my savings, any other money remaining I take more risk with(i.e. P2P loads, stocks and shares) the stock markets doing pretty good at the moment, but as always - don't hope it's gonna remain that way. 

People here like trackers, I prefer specific shares; national grid for example pay 5% dividend, I DRIP (dividend reinvestment plan) the dividend payments quarterly each year and buy more national grid shares - this year the share price alone went up 15% (excluding the DRIP), so I've done pretty well there.

My point is though that none of these things applied to the campaigns against page 3. In that case people who are offended by page 3 were (and presumably will continue) to raise their objections to it.

One of the principles that everyone (quite rightly) brings up is that there is no automatic right to never be offended by things. The flip side of that though is that there is also no ban on being offended, nor is there a ban on expressing that you are offended. To claim that people who are offended should just keep quiet about it is just as bad as claiming that causing offence should not be permitted.

&gt; Freedom of speech is a society issue as much as a government legislation issue. If someone fears for their well-being if they were to say something, their freedom of speech is being impeded. It doesn't matter if the person at their door is carrying a badge or a placard, the effect can be the same.

Here's were I disagree. Freedom of speech *is* a government issue, in that there needs to be laws that dictate the limits. We need to have laws that cover harassment and threats of violence, as well as the other issues you raised.

null,false,Bilgistic,eng-GreaterLondon,Civilisation,null,"Let's take a look at their main claims, starting with the zero growth economy;

&gt; The Greens want something very different.
&gt; 
&gt; Caroline Lucas and colleagues regard economic growth as incompatible with protecting the planet and a fulfilling personal life.
&gt; 
&gt; While their rivals recognise more trade, more innovation, more competition and more globalisation as an engine for prosperity for everyone on the planet, the Greens argue it is nothing more than a race to the bottom that has made the poor poorer, the rich richer, and pillaged the environment.
&gt; 
&gt; The party’s manifesto argues for zero, or even negative growth and falling levels of personal consumption. Britain would be in permanent recession; families would become materially poorer each year. After centuries of growing global connectivity, the Greens want to see greater national self-reliance. 

&gt; And while Labour and the Tories compete on job creation, the Greens argue that government policy should make paid work “less necessary”, with people making their living from the home-based “informal economy”. 

Meanwhile what the Greens [actually say](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/ec.html) is:

&gt; EC201 To this end, the Citizens' Income (see EC730) will allow the current dependence on economic growth to cease, and allow zero or negative growth to be feasible without individual hardship should this be necessary on the grounds of sustainability. (see PB104-106)

&gt; EC203 To devolve economic power to the lowest appropriate level, thereby rendering participants in the economy at all levels less vulnerable to the damaging effects of economic decisions made elsewhere and over which they have no control; to support the 'informal' sector (notably by provision of a Citizens' Income for all) thus reducing the impact of the formal economy.

&gt; EC204 To liberate and empower all sections of society to meet their needs as far as possible from their own resources through activities which are socially enhancing; to encourage all to contribute to society according to their abilities, recognising as they do so, responsibility for themselves, for others, for future generations and for the planet.

They're not aiming for never-ending recessions or a replacement of the formal economy or putting an end to paid work. They're aiming for recessions that minimise the damage on to individuals and decentralisation that empowers local areas. What the Telegraph wrote is simply a lie.

The article continues:

&gt;  International aid should be increased by nearly 50 per cent to one per cent of GDP under Green Policy.

&gt; Merely being a member of al-Qaeda, the IRA and other currently proscribed terrorist groups will no longer be a criminal offence under Green plans, and instead a Green Government should seek to “address desperate motivations that lie behind many atrocities labelled ‘terrorist’,” the policy book states.

&gt; Terrorism, it adds, “is an extremely loaded term. Sometimes governments justify their own terrorist acts by labelling any groups that resist their monopoly of violence 'terrorist’.”

&gt; Britain will leave NATO, end the special relationship with the US, and unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons. A standing army, navy and airforce is “unnecessary”. Bases will be turned into nature reserves and the arms industry “converted” to producing windturbines. 

Now let's look through what the [Greens actually wrote](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/pd.html).

&gt; PD302 On inspection, there is little or no threat of direct invasion of the UK by any nation. Commitment to a large standing army, a navy of large warships around our coastline, squadrons of fighter planes and a cripplingly expensive missile defence system is therefore unnecessary. Any threat of invasion that might arise in the future is so remote that realignment of the UK military and defence preparations would be possible long before any invasion occurred.

&gt; PD312 The Green Party is committed to the early conversion of economic, scientific and technological resources presently used to support the arms race, to socially useful and productive ends. Some military training areas should be decommissioned and used as nature reserves, with suitable provision for access by the public.

&gt; PD313 An imaginative programme of arms conversion could use many of the skills and resources at present tied up in military industry, to create new jobs and produce socially useful products. Conversion would also free research and development expertise and capital. New renewable energy industries, for instance, could be set up in the same area and use the same skills and resources as the existing arms industries e.g. wave power (shipbuilding), wind power (aerospace) and tidal power (power engineering).

They don't want a ""large"" military and want to convert ""some military training areas"" in to nature reserves. Pretending that this is a reference to abolishing the military as a whole is nonsense.

&gt; PD440 Terrorism is an extremely loaded term, frequently used by those in power to justify excessive use of force or the weakening of controls on the exercise of their power. Sometimes governments justify their own terrorist acts by labelling any groups that resist their monopoly of violence ""terrorist"". A Green government, by implementing principles laid out elsewhere in this manifesto, particularly those of self-determination and non-interventionist foreign policies, would seek to overcome the unjust divisions within our global and domestic society and address the desperate motivations that lie behind many atrocities labelled ""terrorist"".

&gt; PD441 However, democratic societies need to protect themselves against those who seek to use terror and violence against them and to have plans in place that mitigate against the effects of attack. In a complex, modern society, it will be a long time before we can entirely eradicate the root causes of ""terrorism"". Any measures to protect society should not undermine the fundamental values that shape a green society: inclusion, justice and equality.

&gt; PD442 Police and intelligence investigations of terrorist activity need to be well resourced, and given sufficient freedom to ensure their safety and efficacy. They must, though, be carried out in a transparent and accountable way, and remain within the law.

&gt; PD443 Those accused or found guilty of atrocities, or planning to commit, aid or abet in their execution, should be dealt with under the same principles as those accused of more conventional criminal activities. In particular, those accused of supporting terrorist acts should have normal rights against arbitrary arrest or imprisonment. It should not be a crime simply to belong to an organisation or have sympathy with its aims, though it should be a crime to aid and abet criminal acts or deliberately fund such acts.

These policies.. are already what we have. The only real change is that they have a big emphasis on underlying causes. As for making it legal to be a member of proscribed groups, that isn't mentioned anywhere. 

Meanwhile on immigration:

&gt;  “Richer regions do not have the right to use migration controls to protect their privileges from others in the long term,” the party’s policy book states.

&gt; A Green Government will “progressively reduce” border controls, including an amnesty for illegal immigrants after five years.

&gt; Access to benefits, the right to vote and tax obligations will apply to everyone living on British soil, regardless of passport. The policy book states: “We will work to create a world of global inter-responsibility in which the concept of a 'British national' is irrelevant and outdated.”

&gt; Political parties will be funded by the state, and the electoral system changed. The monarchy will be abolished. 

To quote the actual policy from [here](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/mg.html) and [here](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/ny.html):

&gt; MG200 The Green Party's highest priority is the creation of a just and ecological world order in which environmental devastation is minimised and needs can be met without recourse to migration.

&gt; MG300 We will work to achieve greater equity between the UK and non-Western countries. In step with this, we will progressively reduce UK immigration controls.

&gt; NY203 In the long term, the Green Party wishes to see the concept of legal nationality abolished. In the short term, while other countries use it, this is not possible.

This is more about creating a world that makes immigration unnecessary rather than opening the borders completely. Framing this as something they want to achieve in 2015-2020 is, at best, disingenuous.

That's not really a massive deal.  We make do without animals in Circuses now after all.

&gt; Women can do no wrong.

That bit lacks detail, I'd want more details before judging it. As it stands i'd agree it ultimately doesn't make much sense. However I think in general one of the policies stated that non-violent criminals shouldn't be locked up and I don't think that one was gender specific.

&gt; Citizens income is almost certainly unworkable in normal conditions. 

I think this one is actually one of the most interesting. I think its something we should try out to see what happens. Same goes with migration. Give us people, give them all some money, see what happens. I don't think the answer is as clear cut as you'd like to make it.  
For me my political outlook has gone beyond the bland and dull and reasonable, I'm into ""interesting"" these days, this strikes me as interesting. No-one has tried this yet, have they? We'll be like the Federation of Planets from Star Trek. Cool!

&gt; Banks literally aren't allowed to make a profit on loans any more. 

I'm not convinced either but this is stating a rate on top of the BOE base which still leaves room for profit. However this does essentially remove the sub prime market for consumer loans. I assume this doesn't effect corporate meaning banks can still make money there, still I wonder if this might hurt the banking sector too much. An interesting debate though but I figure the result would be that anyone with any sort of poor credit would never be able to get credit.... but is that a bad thing? ;)  

&gt; Literally communism.

I think you've found the most crazy one there. That is pretty fucking socialist. It's not communism because its not state owned though. It merely states that everything has to be collectively owned by people that buy from or work for the business.  

&gt; So when the Greens aren't in, any old government can print money whenever they want. Deficit? What deficit? I just printed £150bn and now the deficit is gone. Praise me, people of the UK. I am the greatest leader.  

I get what you're saying but it used to be like that before. In addition ""quantitative easing"" is pretty fucked up in all counts so I'm not really convinced when either the government or an independent body controls it.

&gt; Okay, I can see where you're coming from. It's an extremely naive view of the world

I agree. Falklands was reasonably recent. Still, since then they're mostly right. The issue with having a military is that its existence increases the chance of your government performing military acts. Maybe we could try out being like Iceland and see what results?  

&gt; So after completely dismantling our military and military industry they expect us to rebuild our military and military industry from scratch.

No, they're talking about using the land/property and resources formerly owned by the military for hippy purposes following the dismantling of the military.  

&gt; Russia/Ukraine escalated in mere months, for example. Things can move incredibly quickly. And if you know that your enemy was completely defenceless why on earth would you wait and let them build their military back up before attacking? You wouldn't.

I agree with you here but to be perfectly frank its not like we're fucking doing anything about it right now, is it? Last I checked Crimera is still held by the Russians. Seems to me the only reason we have a military these days is to beat up people significantly weaker than ourselves which isn't particularly laudable. When something _real_ happens like this we shy away. EDIT: To be frank I think we should have declared war on Russia until we wrestled Crimea back out of their hands, call me crazy but you _don't_ do shit like that in Europe, we have to send a message. We can't play with the bear, it doesn't understand that, it only understands hurt. Still, we'll find out who is right following the sanctions. Maybe the peaceful means will be judged correct later on. 

&gt; They're completely authoritarian and they wish to write authoritarianism into law, while still remaining a democratic nation. So while the Greens might use their dumb as fuck laws in a nice manner, what happens when they get kicked out?

That's just hyperbole. Still I appreciate all the effort, +1 to you dear sir. Still, I think considering the details gave us some decent ground to turn over in this debate, don't you?  

EDIT: Personally I thought the idea the extend the NHS to pets was pretty fucking stupid myself. I mean.... they're just fucking pets, its not like there is a good chance of my cats somehow generating tax revenue to help this country or discover cold fusion like there is with humans. From my perspective pets are entertainment systems, as cold as that outlook might be I think it closer to reality than anything else, I mean we specifically bred them to be dumb as fuck and docile so they don't really have much practical use.

I do feel that when it has been decided that someone doesn't need asylum the process of deporting them needs to be streamlined. It can take years of appeals and judicial reviews before we can deport them. In all this time they can be receiving section 4 support and accommodation.

The system is abused by asylum seekers a lot. I have seen asylum seekers who have received asylum in other European countries only to travel and apply here because the UK is seen as a more attractive place.

 I have seen people from western countries attempt asylum (even a few from America) who clearly didn't deserve it and receive lots of funding while their claim is being processed. 

I have known asylum seekers who have been granted asylum enquire about travel docs to visit family in the  country they claimed asylum from. They can't do this but many travel via a third destination to get around this.

Just because someone is born in Nigeria doesn't mean they deserve asylum. There are many people in nigeria living in safety. The individual cases need to be judged on their merit. She has failed in her bid for aslyum and needs to return home. The refugee councils offer a return program including money to help her transition back to her country of origin. Her child may be used to living here but there is no reason why he can't adapt to living in Nigeria.

That being said you are right. The nature of the cases I dealt with meant that I didn't see many who genuinely needed asylum because their cases were dealt with much quicker. Some people genuinely need asylum, and I am willing to pay for aid for them. We just need a better system where failed asylum seekers can be deported, instead of lodging appeals for years then eventually qualifying for indefinite leave to remain based on time spent in the UK.

Rape is an incredibly under-reported crime, which is a problem. Unfortunately, rape-victims too often feel like they shouldn't come forward and/or should internalize the blame, because they worry people won't believe them and/or just think worse of them for it (things like ""it probably wasn't even rape"", ""she was probably dressed a certain way, had it coming"" etc, the sort of things you can read 10 times a day on that sub you like to frequent ;)). 

This is psychologically very damaging, to both men and women, as well as, of course, allowing the perpetrators of one of the more horrid crimes one can commit to walk free.

&gt;Most GAS (Group A Strep) infections are relatively mild illnesses such as ""strep throat,"" or impetigo (a skin infection). Occasionally these bacteria can cause severe and even life-threatening diseases.

&gt;Severe, sometimes life-threatening GAS disease may occur when these bacteria get into parts of the body where bacteria usually are not found, such as the blood, muscle, or the lungs. These infections are called ""invasive GAS disease.""

&gt;Approximately 9,000-11,500 cases of invasive GAS disease occur each year in the United States, resulting in 1,000-1,800 deaths annually. STSS and necrotizing fasciitis are each responsible for an average of about 6%-7% of these invasive cases. In contrast, there are several million cases of strep throat and impetigo each year.

&gt;Although healthy people can get invasive GAS disease, people with chronic illnesses like cancer, diabetes, and chronic heart or lung disease, and those who use medications such as steroids have a higher risk.

null,false,MrFlabulous,,Glorious People's Republic Of Asbostan,null,"Here in Sunny Sweden a lot of people fly either a flag or a pennant, if not all year round then certainly on Sweden's National Day.  What is particularly curious about nationaldagen is that it's a relatively recent idea. It started out very quietly, not many people cottoned on to the idea, but over the last 15 years or so it's become quite a celebration; open-air concerts (and of course their national anthem) and barbecues, also a great deal of drunkenness.

*However*, Swedes in general are not particularly patriotic, at least not in a tub-thumping, chest-beating kind of way. In general they don't like to cause a fuss (apart from the odd burst of neo-nazism or serial-killing), and Swedish patriotism is, if done at all, very quiet and understated.

My point? I think the flag-waving kind of helps to a degree given Swedish society. Despite the small pockets of right-wing pissflappery the inherently liberal nature of the country allows us foreigners to integrate a little easier: the state provides us with free Swedish courses and encourages us to join in with social activities such as fika (which is fine if you like cinnamon cakes) and binge-drinking. So we feel more integrated with the Swedes, but without feeling pressured I guess.

So certain aspects are fine, and I include running up a bit of blue and yellow cloth up a big piece of wood in that. I'd say that the Swedish way of making immigrants feel more ""Swedish"" (and therefore a part of Swedish society) is not too bad at all. Where Sweden *does* fall down is the fact that the country was very isolationalist for many years and some of the older and less well-educated people in the country have a bit of trouble accepting Eastern Europeans and Syrians, and you always get the occasional loon who despises the multiculties but the fact is that singing a few songs and waving a flag does not impart pressure on people like me to conform. Hell, Sveriges nationaldag just feels like the last night at the Proms, to me at any rate. Bit of fun.

I would have no issue with schools at home running up the Union Flag, but the label that UKIP have placed on it, that whole ""reasserting Britishness"" stuff is truly pissole. So yeah, I agree that it's all a bit shoddy. And the suggestions you give to encourage the national identity thing are what have served Sweden so well in recent years.

&gt;__Full-reserve banking__, also known as __100% reserve banking__, refers to an alternative to [fractional reserve banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking) in which banks are required to keep the full amount of each [depositor's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_account) funds in [cash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash), ready for immediate withdrawal on demand. Funds deposited by customers in [demand deposit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_deposit) accounts (such as checking accounts) could not be [loaned out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan) by the bank because it would be legally required to retain the full deposit to satisfy potential demand for payments. Proposals for full reserve banking systems generally do not place such restrictions on deposits that are not [payable on demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_deposit), for example [time deposits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_deposit) or savings accounts.

I never said £32k was the average salary - please show me where my calculations are flawed and correct them then.

Ironically you are correct anyway at £26.5k we do spend pay €160 per month on the NHS.

As far as I can find the average wage in the UK is between £22,000 and £26,000.

At those values, using the website you linked 

£22,000 - £3.27 per day - £99.46 per month to the NHS

£26,000 - £4.20 per day - £127.75 per month to the NHS

£99.46 --&gt; €130.01

£127.75 --&gt; €166.86

My argument is, we already have an insurance based system - for the whole country.  We pay into the government, they pay for all the medical costs - it's essentially the same thing, except rather punitively changing the costs per person based on circumstances they have little or no control of we charge people more if they earn more and can thus spare more.

As apposed to paying to a private company to provide us insurance, who wants to make a profit first, and care second.

Are your car insurance, house insurance, vets insurance &amp; all other insurance premiums going up or down?

Do you want to be having the kind of arguments with your insurance company you currently do with accidents &amp; issues with your roof or floods when you have cancer but don't have quite the right cover, or didn't take the policy stipend that allows you to go surfing?

I'd rather just know I'm covered, and not worry about it.

null,false,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,null,"&gt; There's a reason we've converged into the middle and it's not because of some conspiracy theory it's because it's the best way to manage the country.

I vehemently disagree. The reason we've converged in the middle is because its the most effective means of winning elections. The Clinton era. Its the same way we teach children how to pass exams instead of teaching them subjects.  
Presently we have a system of welfare that isn't maintainable without significant changes but no politician is willing to make those changes (revenue increase or significant cuts) because of their backers and/or political suicide on telly. Instead we have the current government slowly running services into the ground as stealthily as possible while maintaining adamantly that they support these services.  

&gt; If you want to experience socialism why don't you just go to Argentina or Cuba? Even France right now. 

We live in a socialist system. What are you, American? We have a pretty big welfare bill in this country and that is socialism, our country is reasonably socialist so I don't need to go anywhere to achieve experience of that. Remember that the Yanks tried to fuck us over when we voted in Labour after the war, that was our transition into socialism. Its done, its in the past and the welfare state remains.  

&gt; I just don't understand why you want to destroy living standards for everyone else based on some provably false ideology.  

I have no idea what you're talking about.  

&gt; Ideology is as bad as religion, patriotism or any other movement that relies on an appeal to emotion to force people to do things that are not in their interest.

What the fuck do you think I'm talking about? I'm talking about *having a fucking plan*, a vision, an idea of what you want this country to be like as opposed to aimlessly shuffling pieces of paper around on a desk and backing out of any real decision making due to fear of losing votes. 
I mean seriously, what is the plan of the Tories? ""Oh cut taxes, increase growth"" or Labour? ""Increase taxes, increase growth"" or the Lib Dems? ""help out the poor and the middle class, reform voting, increase growth"". None of these people are fucking visionaries, are they? At least the Lib Dems are interested in voting reform which is a principle reason they get my vote.  

&gt; If your appeal isn't based on solid fact and evidence but rather 'won't somebody please think of the poor people!' then it is not worth listening to. The saddest fact is that the people who typically vote Green....  

Seriously who the fuck do you even think you're talking to? I'm a Lib Dem voter, I just appreciate that a party has finally broken this ideological deadlock by putting out some radical policy. We might even make politics actually interesting to debate again for once.  
The last time we started talking like this we got the welfare state and emancipation for everyone.

The police definitely should have been recording every incidence and handing it off to the CPS to decide, however a lot of the cases they were not moving forward were those with little chance of a conviction (e.g. a ""he said she said case"" with little additional evidence).      

So while the number of cases hitting courts and the CPS might increase, the actual conviction rate might get proportionately worse (because weaker cases are being tried). This is both good and bad depending on your perspective (e.g. ""good"" if you think victims deserve their day in court, bad in terms of ""wasted"" system resources which are already over-stretched and underfunded, in particular after the Conservative's massive cuts).

There is though. It's got a bias towards women when claiming equality for all. The reason egalitarianism exists is because Feminism is usually mainly for womens issues, which is fine. To call it equality for all, is wrong. 

&gt;Do you also believe LGBT advocate groups should change theirs names as to avoid a 'bias'.

No. They do not claim to be for equality for everyone, simply LGBT people. 

Imo feminism is majorly for womens issues. This is why mens rights movements have been created, since there are valid issues men have that do not seem to be addressed in other movements. If feminists didn't claim it was for equality for all, I'd be fine with that. Say it as it is, it's for womens rights (especially in non western countries) and equality favouring women. 

Also, just because women supposedly are worse off (it's not the oppression Olympics) that doesn't give people the right to flat out ignore issues faced by people who aren't women.

&gt; The police work with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in deciding the most appropriate course of action in each case. The CPS may decide that the police should charge an offender with a lesser offence than the one originally recorded. This does not mean that the police have incorrectly recorded the crime but rather that the CPS have applied their own charging standard which takes into account additional factors, such as whether there is a realistic chance of obtaining a conviction on the basis of the admissible evidence. Once a suspect has been identified, arrested and charged, they can either be cautioned by the police or prosecuted at court.

Yes, there is a slightly higher conviction rate for sexual offences, however it is only 3% and in addition if you look at the above quote from what you linked, perpetrators are often charged with lesser offences in order to secure a conviction - I can offer anecdotal evidence that this is true as well.

So actually I was asking for a source because I found your claim difficult to believe, in addition, having read through your source I can definitively say that your claim was false.

He drops off into the midfield a lot, he's not a standard target man, back to goal, type forward. And that's what Sheffield United would be used to in League One, physical target forwards. Even if Adebayor played that role, Sheffield United wouldn't be uncomfortable with it.

What League One/Two teams struggle more with is smart forwards who make off ball runs into space between defenders or are able to get in behind. Simply because they are less used to that type of forward in the lower leagues, they would have had a more difficult time dealing with Soldado making runs into the box looking for service from Eriksen or perhaps Townsend, who looks slightly better than useless lately.

As mentioned by COYS1989, Soldado's run from the top of the area onto a ball over the backline produced a penalty, his runs could have been useful early on in the match as well when United were playing very aggressive out of possession, pressing and hounding, the game was quite open for the first 15-20 minutes.

Also, it's important to minimise taxes. So use all the ISA, pension, etc options that you are allowed.

With that in mind there are 3 broad decisions you should consider:

0. Do you need to have an emergency fund? If so, decide how much and put that in an instant access investment. Or at least relatively easy to access. (Funnily Premium Bonds would even do, and some ISAs).

0. For the rest of the money, then decide what % you want to put in the Stock Market and what % you want to put in Savings (e.g. Bond ISAs). It's not a either or. And you should never have too much of either.  If you want to invest in property, gold, etc. Decide if you want to do it directly, or via a fund.

0. Once you've worked out your Equity / Bond / Other / Emergencies split. Then comes the fun stuff for the Equities and the Bonds. You can either pick stocks yourself or buy an index fund. Index funds let you invest in the market. Market goes up, you do well. If you pick stocks, you'll need to be careful to use common sense and not get caught up in any speculation.

**Price of product:** £35 for 45ml/1.5fl.oz.

**Product claims:** ""*Invigorating DHC Renewing AHA Cream exfoliating milky lotion boasts a powerful 10% concentration of lactic acid to sweep away lifeless cells and reveal glowing, new radiance and a brighter complexion. Use at nighttime, once or twice a week.*""

**About you:** Combo dehydrated diet related breakout prone, sensitive to exfoliation.

**Your opinion:** I've been using 8% glycolic acid for the past 6ish months so this was supposed to be a sort of downgrade (10% lactic acid) but owwie did it sting on my first application. It wasn't stinging open spots just the areas where my skin is thinner or more sensitive; cheekbones, sides of nose and inbetween eyebrows.

As for the product itself, it comes in a nice frosted glass bottle so you can clearly see how much is left and the nozzle can be twisted to lock/unlock the pump. It's fragrance free but it the ingredients definitely give it a smell, probably the olive fruit oil. The pump outputs a rather small amount but you only need 2-3 for face and neck and it's pretty lightweight and absorbs easily. Even though it's called a cream, I have to follow up with an actual moisturiser and consider this more of a treatment lotion.

I also like the fact they emphasise the need for sun protection even after discontinuing use too, and specifically say it's a side effect of AHAs.

Having a welfare state doesn't mean we are socialists much in the same way having a stock market doesn't make you totally capitalist.

&gt;Presently we have a system of welfare that isn't maintainable without significant changes but no politician is willing to make those changes (revenue increase or significant cuts) because of their backers and/or political suicide on telly. 

Agreed. We need to make massive cuts and reforms.

I'm going off on a tangent here but it's worth pointing out. You can't have Labour's preferred level of spending without a strong economy to pay for it. This has always been the down fall of the left. They punish success and hamper private initiative through punitive tax measures which initially might raise tax but then fall down. The right balance is fiscal conservatism with social liberalism and a strong safety net.

Sturridge can finish, get in scoring positions, create space for others and is a leader by example. he is one of our ""senior"" players and the kids look up to him. his value is so understated sometimes, even with everyone wanting him back. anyways the team looks a whole lot better right now, will have 2-3 formations under their belt and we will be able to sign 1-2 players this summer that can push us on to that next level. i think a realistic hope this season is to win the league cup, push on to the semis in the fa cup, reach el quarters/semis  and finish top 5. that is realistic. my hope is we win the league cup, fa cup and europa league and nip utd for top 4...
