I see why you care about getting decent weed, but you seemed to be arguing that legalisation would inevitably lead to there being nothing but mass market ""ASDA weed"", whereas your own analogy showed that that isn't necessarily the case.

Nearly all legal products are available in a range of qualities and from a range of vendors which compete on a variety of variables, including price and quality.  It's not immediately obvious why legal weed would be any different.

Whilst these government initiated courses which teach you how to turn on a computer are useless for many, I believe that it is important for everyone to educate themselves in as many ways as possible. 

Education is learning new knowledge and gaining new skills, and what better way to do that, than using the internet as a source. Yes I am serious. There is a wealth of information and opportunity online which people sometimes take for granted.

People spend all day playing around on websites such as Facebook, but how many people have considered learning how to make their own website for example? How about designing a website based around an industry you want to work in? Wouldn't that be nice to show your potential employer on your CV? You get to learn a new set of skills and gain deeper knowledge about your industry. Or why not build the next Reddit.com?  

Another example could be using ebay as a source of income. Buy low sell high. Its a simple concept. Sell some stuff around your house and you got some starting capital. 

Are you a musician? Go develop your skills from lessons online and busk on the street.

These are 3 random things off the top of my head, and I'm sure there are lots more. All require you to be a self starter. Opportunites are everywhere to anyone that wants it.

...The thing is, most of us - yes, really, most people - are still basically honest. We still have some human capacity for feeling and acting convivially. Because we're still outraged by these shites. 

What PE does, by calling these people out, is hold up a mirror to the mainstream media which conspires to *normalise* this sort of behaviour. 

You don't have to suckle on the national news-teat for too long to conclude that *everyone* does ""tax avoidance""; *everyone* lives in a mediocre suburban brick-pimple in frenzied fear and loathing of neighbours they've never spoken to, and *everyone* has two unique snowflake children rendered normal by appropriate levels of conspicuous consumption. And so on.

The next step to losing your mind is concluding that ""if everybody does it"", it's *OK*.  That is what most media is essentially selling you. Whether they're doing it deliberately or not - I don't give a damn. I doubt it, but really don't care. 

Private Eye is - largely - outside of their ecosystem. That's why I love it. It still has the ability to shine a light on those fucks.

Firstly the evidence he uses while compelling is flawed and doesn't take into account the differing ethnical make up of each country for one. That is the fundamental problem with sociological evidence is that all the variables can never be disentangled from one another effectively and thus the magnitude of the effect of each one compared to other variables can never be known. 

Secondly Schulman exposes a weakness in his own argument towards the end of his essay:

&gt;In fact, limits on free speech have in effect been privatized in this country[the USA]

He has recognised that the value of the US as a control for an experiment on anti-hate laws is limited due to the private sector filling the gap and thus the studies are comparing only anti-hate laws against anti-hate campaigns by private groups.

While that in itself would be an interesting comparison, it limits the relevance of this source to the argument at hand as the source is not comparing anti-hate legislation with true unhindered and protected free speech but with quasi-free speech in which the limitations on free speech have risen organically from the populace, rather than being state-sponsored.",null,0,null,1424272097,null,0,false,0,cop8qrw,null,t3_2w7684,null,t1_cop8qrw,null,t1_cop0ggg,null,null,null,1424656872,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Depends. In most areas of law in principal a verbal contract is as binding as a written one.  The tricky part in practise tends to be demonstrating that the verbal contract exists and exactly what the terms are.

AIUI there's a concept called ""custom and practise"" which applies in employment law which basically says that if the contract says one thing but what's actually happening is something else, then the contract is deemed to have changed.

So I think you could certainly argue that you are now on a Monday to Friday contract.  I wouldn't take my word for it though; if and when it becomes an issue I would seek advice from the CAB, ACAS or your union if you have one.

The other consideration is that the employer ultimately has the right to decide what job roles exist - you can stick to the letter of your contract but if the employer decides that they really need someone working Wednesday to Saturday rather than Mon to Fri they can make the Mon to Fri post redundant and create a Weds to Sat one.",null,0,null,1424272465,null,0,false,0,cop8xny,null,t3_2wb9fl,null,t1_cop8xny,null,t3_2wb9fl,null,null,null,1424656961,null,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4,null

  With the MVP you get one tank, which is a bit shit.  
  
  My recommendation; if the vape works out well for you, get the iclear 30b - it fits nice and snug on the MVP, holds 3ml in one go (so you're not constantly refilling) and gives you decent airflow meaning you don't get a tight draw (like if someone has rolled you an amateur spliff, which is my experience with the supplied tank).  
  
  The coils on the 30b are piss easy to replace when they burn out (here is one disassembled from the last thread; http://i.imgur.com/AOVYApW.jpg) and they last long enough.  
  
  I had a bunch of spares left over from the last few years of vaping, so I just dumped the tank the MVP came with immediately, it was a bit... shit, but to be honest it does the job and I'm a snob.   
  
 Basically, if you're not up for spunking the extra tenner for the 30b and the 7 quid for the coils, wait, burn the standard one it comes with out, and then decide what you want to replace it with: the 30b is just my recommendation as I know it fits the model really well, and they're good value to quality.

Wages were always going to take a hit when you dump that many people into the pool looking for a job, it'd be daft to expect otherwise. That's why getting unemployment down was always going to be a high priority which continually seems to be working as shown here with unemployment down again and wages increasing at the fastest rate in years.

To me it looks like a long term plan at least partly coming to fruition, through continued bad news from many other countries/zones we seem to have weathered pretty well, with the future signs looking even better.

Think of it as; 

Total strength = (THC% - CBD%)

Strains are getting stronger because people are breeding out the CBD, which is one of the more medically beneficial parts of the plant, and increasing the THC. (Not that THC isn't medicinal)

Skunk is far from the strongest weed out there due to the fact (as you've said) it does actually have high CBD too. The press will probably start toting its high THC% out of context soon ignoring this; which is a shame, as I'd prefer strains to be referred to in media by their %'s. This way the public can begin to understand it. 

They can make the logical comparison between weed and booze; You wouldn't down a 40% spirit, just like you wouldn't smash 2 full vape bags of 23% THC weed, but you could have a nice time with a 14% vape bag just like a pint of beer.

Prohibition takes away the consumer's choice and forces them to buy what ever weed is available. Legalisation and education are the only way to ensure that people know what they are buying and what they are doing. Scaremongering and propaganda like this TV show do not help.

The damage the government did was as a result of the popular opinion not because the government itself. You cant have it both ways. You can't claim the government is forced to change by the people and then say that people need protecting from the government as much as the government needs to protect minorities from the rest of the population. In a liberal democracy the government is a rather shaky mirror of the people but it is still a reflection of the opinion of the population and not its own independent entity. If you care to argue against that there is some merit to that to but you would be undermining your own point that the government was forced to change by the people. 

&gt;Maybe not now but 100 years? 150 years? We got it wrong with blacks, women, LGBT..

Again as you said the government persecuted those groups because of the prevalent views in the population (""the original persecution was popular"") not because of pro-active measures taken by the government. I would also point out that if we enshrine progressive values in law now it makes it harder for regressive public opinion in the future to affect those protected by the progressive laws. Obviously not impossible because laws can be changed and repealed but it has more inertia and thus requires a greater weight of public opinion to bring about a regressive change. 

&gt;Another point: enforcement of law is threat of and in some cases actual violence. Using that against people for simply being racist (for example) is immoral.

I fail to see how punishing people for dong things we would consider morally wrong is in itself morally wrong? if that were the case then our entire justice system is immoral.

I hope you are well.

Having done a bit of research I can copy some information here in regards to remove your difficult executor from administering your late fathers estate.

Have a read! Please also take advantage of the above comment, and take FREE legal advice (initial consultations are generally free).

What if the named executor is not performing his duties correctly?
A beneficiary or next of kin may question the executor’s actions.  If in doubt, the first step is always to write to the executor and ask him to render an account of the administration of the estate.  If the beneficiary or next of kin is still not satisfied by the executors’ explanation, then he or she may apply to court to remove and substitute the executor.

An attempt by the beneficiaries to remove the executor is not an easy application.  The beneficiaries must prove serious misbehavior before the court will even consider forcing an executor to step down.  In general, the courts will only remove an executor if the beneficiaries can show the following:

the executor has become disqualified since the deceased appointed him
the executor is incapable of performing his duties
the executor is unsuitable for the position.
Disqualification
An executor will only become disqualified if he has been convicted of a crime and sent to jail.

Incapable of performing duties
An executor will be seen as being incapable of performing his duties if the beneficiaries can prove that the executor has a physical and mental disability, whether the disability is permanent or temporary, which is preventing the executor from performing his duties.

Unsuitability
An executor becomes unsuitable to perform his duties if there is either a conflict of interest or some form of serious misconduct.  As regards misconduct, this must be very serious in nature, leading to the estate suffering as a result of the misconduct.  The court is likely to consider the following examples of misconduct:

stealing from the estate
failure to keep accounting records
failure to obey a court order
wasting or mismanaging the estate.
Misconduct is not always clear and may not always result in removal.  For example, the court is not likely to remove an executor from his office if he has acted rudely or been unfriendly to the beneficiaries, or if he has repeatedly refused to give the beneficiaries information, or if he has been slow on settling the will.

How to remove and substitute an executor
If the beneficiaries have serious concerns regarding the ability of an executor to perform his duties, the beneficiaries must firstly write to the executor and ask him to explain his actions.  If an explanation is not forthcoming or the beneficiaries are not satisfied by the executors’ explanation, he or she may make an application to court to remove or substitute the executor.

The High Court has a discretionary power under section 50 of the Administration of Justice Act 1985 to appoint a substitute personal representative or to terminate the appointment of a personal representative.  Such an application must be made pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 57.13.  If proceedings regarding an inheritance dispute have already commenced, then such an application is made by application notice.  However, if there are no proceedings, then a part 8 claim needs to be made.

The application must be supported by the following:

A certified sealed copy of the grant of probate or letters of administration.
A witness statement setting out the reasons why the removal or substitution of the executor is sought (referring to his disqualification, incapacity or unsuitability as per above), particulars of the deceased’s assets and liabilities, those who are in possession of documents relating to the estate, names of beneficiaries and details of their interest and the proposed individual to substitute the executor.
Unless the proposed executor is the official solicitor, his signed or sealed consent to act.
A witness statement of the proposed executor’s fitness to act in such capacity, if he is an individual.",null,0,null,1424273501,null,0,false,0,cop9hr0,null,t3_2t1tda,null,t1_cop9hr0,null,t3_2t1tda,null,null,null,1424657220,null,1,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,1,null

Similar to the Republican vs Democrat ""differences"" that makes the main British political parties look like Marxists vs Fascists. 

Even worse is how selective they are. A famous, but slightly old, look at this is Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media by Edward Herman (media analyst and finance professor) and Noam Chomsky (too many academic contributiosn to list). 

The 5 main points they identify as problems are (taken from wikipedia as I don't have the book to hand) -

    *  Size, Ownership, and Profit Orientation: The dominant mass-media outlets are large firms which are run for profit. Therefore they must cater to the financial interest of their owners - often corporations or particular controlling investors. The size of the firms is a necessary consequence of the capital requirements for the technology to reach a mass audience. 
    *  The Advertising License to Do Business: Since the majority of the revenue of major media outlets derives from advertising (not from sales or subscriptions), advertisers have acquired a ""de facto licensing authority"". Media outlets are not commercially viable without the support of advertisers. News media must therefore cater to the political prejudices and economic desires of their advertisers. This has weakened the working class press, for example, and also helps explain the attrition in the number of newspapers. 
   *  Sourcing Mass Media News: Herman and Chomsky argue that “the large bureaucracies of the powerful subsidize the mass media, and gain special access [to the news], by their contribution to reducing the media’s costs of acquiring [...] and producing, news. The large entities that provide this subsidy become 'routine' news sources and have privileged access to the gates. Non-routine sources must struggle for access, and may be ignored by the arbitrary decision of the gatekeepers.” 
   * Flak and the Enforcers: ""Flak"" refers to negative responses to a media statement or program (e.g. letters, complaints, lawsuits, or legislative actions). Flak can be expensive to the media, either due to loss of advertising revenue, or due to the costs of legal defense or defense of the media outlet's public image. Flak can be organized by powerful, private influence groups (e.g. think tanks). The prospect of eliciting flak can be a deterrent to the reporting of certain kinds of facts or opinions.
   * Anti-Communism: This was included as a filter in the original 1988 edition of the book, but Chomsky argues that since the end of the Cold War (1945–91), anticommunism was replaced by the ""War on Terror"", as the major social control mechanism.

If memory serves two of the examples they look at are Western coverage of Timor and Cambodia, especially in regards to the political side of the conflicts and unrest there. It is important to remember that while a few ""evil"" manipulative individuals are involved most of this is caused by a systemic bias, not evil men in dark board rooms.

This wikipedia page seems ok for an overview but I only skimmed it so it might be missing some info or be innacurate.

Here is a video of Andrew Marr interviewing Noam Chomsky in 1996, where they discuss these ideas, among other things.

We will send you the updated TDS certificate so that you can be assured of being protected for a proportion of the deposit.

When you moved out and paid the outgoing tenants their deposit, you in essence have let them off the hook for the damage they've caused, which it looks like the landlord is trying to claim. (Which sucks :( )

But I have a gripe with WhoScored pieces, which are pretty good until they shoehorn their statistics in:

&gt; He is scoring less frequently (a goal every 295 minutes this season compared to every 223 last), **but this is irrelevant because** his goals are barely ever coming from anything other than the penalty spot.

This is one of those cases where it's better to exclude penalties when calculating minutes per goal; as Michael Owen would say, you can only score the penalties you win, so penalties are an indicator of team performance rather than the individual player. We won more penalties last season because Suarez is a slippery nightmare for defenders, and were generally more dangerous going forward. **Gerrard has actually scored more non-penalty goals this season than last**.

&gt; he is making significantly fewer tackles (1.8 per game to 2.9) and interceptions (0.7 to 1.4). He is also being dribbled past almost twice as much (1.0 to 0.6)

This would be far more useful if they'd selected only for the games where he was playing DM (or maybe also included CM in the 3-4-2-1). But no, a professional statistics website doesn't have the nuance to even consider that an AM won't tackle or intercept as much as a CM or DM. **I'm sure there'd still have been a drop if they'd excluded his AM games** - like I said at the top, I agree with the article.

null,false,ggow,null,null,null,"I didn't say they were non nationals, I said they weren't residents. There's a big fuck-off difference. Someone who is Scottish is not entitled to free education in Scotland unless they have been resident in Scotland/rEU for the three years prior to the commencement of their course. Similar, someone who is English, if the have been resident in Scotland/rEU for the three years immediately prior, gets free tuition in Scotland. It's not an ethnic thing, it's a residency thing(interacting with EU law). 

&gt;It's unfair and a fuck you to the rest of the nation

It's unfair, I'll grant you that. What do you propose though? Scotland just has to match the policies pushed through by England to keep it fair. The Scottish people want free tuition. The Scottish Government was elected on that manifesto promise. It's fair that they deliver on that. The only way that it is possible to have that policy is by some level of discrimination. I wish it were different. I wish the English Government hadn't pushed through such ridiculous raises in tuition fees. Unfortunately, it's not possible for the Scottish Government, with a budget fixed by Westminster, to deliver the policy without discriminating against non-residents. (Incidentally, when the funding was cut for tuition fees in England, budget cuts had to be found elsewhere in the Scottish budget in order to keep funding our tuition-free system. It's not all happy clappy milk the English taxpayer as you seem to believe). 

And I don't know what you mean by free-reign all over the UK. They are treated exactly the same in England's universities as people from England would be. (And arguably worse in NI and Wales, if I understand their system correctly). Incidentally, the idea of intra-country/state discrimination is quite common on a global basis. US states discriminate against students not from them, for example. 

&gt;but all of a sudden they're an independent nation

Having separate policies does not an independent nation make. Is Vermont acting like an independent nation when it charges New Yorkers more to attend its universities? No. Is Wales acting likewise when it pursues a education policy which is similarly discriminatory? Clearly not. It's just different regions exercising their autonomy. That's a good thing. Unfortunately, the world isn't perfect so when they do things differently sometimes there are winners and sometimes there are losers. In a perfect world, with no budgetary constraints, there'd be no need to charge English-resident students. 

&gt;Scotland can keep its charges but England and Wales should charge Scottish students international fees to use their universities also.

Feel free. If the England's government decides it wishes to charge Scottish students international rates (or, in other words, removes Scottish students from the capping system in place on UK/EU students), that'd probably be within its rights. I'd say it's not a justifiable policy, given there's nowhere near the same pressure on England as there on Scotland due to the size differentials, but sure. I wouldn't be surprised when the Scottish Government 'retaliates' and decides to treat the English residents as Scottish residents were being treated in England. That kind of tit for tat nonsense, however, is how Scotland goes from 'acting' like an independent state to actually being an independent state.

Last season, as amazing as it was, I think we deluded ourselves into thinking something that we shouldn't have: that Stevie was still the player he was at 25, that we could still build a team solely around him. At 34, that is unheard of. Our attack was so good, so devastating, that we couldn't see that Gerrard was no real good at DM: had we played Lucas for some of the season, I'm sure we would have seen a decline in the goals we conceded. 

From that, our expectations have been much too high for how Gerrard could play this season and even next. I'll admit that I even thought he could go an extra 3 seasons, that he'd be a major component in our campaigns, but the truth is that we've expected too much from him every time he's on the pitch. We've expected him to put in performances that amaze us because last season he did. I've expected him to run the show like he was for his whole career here, but he just can't.

That's my two cents anyway.

null,false,avapoet,null,null,null,"I worked in a building belonging to the Welsh Assembly Government (not as a government employee; as an employee of a company that was a tenant to them as part of a scheme for small tech businesses). The car park had a card-controlled barrier to manage access, but it had never been activated: the barrier just stood open the whole time. One April Fools, I pranked the entire building: I cloned the website of the building using a mirroring tool and set it up at a similar-looking domain name. Then I added an extra section to the site by which building tenants could apply for parking permits. Finally, I spoofed the email address of the building manager and sent a message to all of the tenants, telling them that use of the car park barriers would soon be in effect and that anybody who needed one had to apply for a swipe card with which they'd be able to get in and out. I even had a Welsh-fluent friend do me a translation of the email so that I could send it out bilingually.

When my victims clicked the link to fill out their applications, it started normally: the first page asked for their name, company name, room number, floor, phone number, and email address. The second page asked for details about their car - make, model, age, registration plate, colour, how long they'd owned it, whether anybody else regularly drives it, petrol or diesel, whether they regularly drive any other cars...

The third page started on their driving habits: do they always, often, sometimes drive to work? How far do they travel? Are there any public transport options they've considered? And so on. The third page started collecting demographic information: What languages do they speak? To what level are they educated? What ethnic group would they define themselves as? Strange possible answers started to appear on this increasingly-unlikely form, such as ""Klingon"" among the languages and ""Chicken"" among the ethnic groups.

The fifth page was lifted mostly from a driving theory test manual: it asked about stopping distances and the meanings of various road signs. The sixth page continued the trend, but switched from metric to imperial units interchangeably within the same question (e.g. offering stopping distance options from a drop-down in both feet and in metres).

And so on, and so on. Nobody made it past the tenth page, and the building was abuzz with gossip about this stupid form that had been set up by the government, and what was it all about. The building manager got a *lot* of emails from confused tenants, and started going from office to office to try to work out how it had happened. It was a world of hilarious.

Central defence is not up to it at the moment. Kompany is out of form, Mangala is too inexperienced. Maybe next year, but not this time out for sure.

If we spend all of our time developing systems we already know about, we don't push forward our understanding of anything, and don't get any real breakthroughs that open new possibilities, only more efficient versions of current capability. 

The classic example would be the laser; the guy who made the first working one was [told to stop wasting his time by his supervisor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Townes#Career). It's hard to think of a single device that has had such a profound impact on [so many areas of science and engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_laser_applications) , I think we can count ourselves lucky that people were prepared to ""waste money"" on fundamental research.

A problem we're facing at the moment is that capitalism *is* having influence over how research budgets are allocated. The impact section of the [REF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Excellence_Framework) is used as a metric by non-scientists to decide who to give money to, and is skewed towards research that has direct applications/is closer to market than more fundamental scientific endeavors (such as particle physics, solar physics, for example). All that happens in that case is the government subsidises the work that *should* be paid for by industry, and in the process fundamental science loses out, which harms the overall effort of science research. The sad thing is that fundamental research has paid for itself [again](http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/birth-web) and [again](http://cds.cern.ch/record/1551933/files/Strategy_Report_LR.pdf), and yet the impact (read: how much money we can squeeze from this in the short term) is still considered an important aspect of deciding who to fund.

But actually, having suarez masked a lot of problems. namely a shaky defense and a lack of a real system. our games were nailbiters because we'd always leak goals. And we never saw any signs of the possession football that Rodgers touted so loudly when he signed on.

Currently our defense is much tighter. We press as a team much more effectively. we are starting slowly to play out of the back with confidence. We have longer spells of possession. Our passing is getting quicker as players gel and get learn their off-the-ball duties. only thing we lack is the goals. I'd say that means OVERALL we are better off than last season.

Well ""strong"" is subjective but given that the persecution normally happens with legislate power I would say every one of them Government's was ""too strong"". Examples:

Jim crow Laws: Easy, its in the wording.. Jim crow **law** . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws

&gt;The Jim Crow laws were racial segregation state and local laws...

More extreme cases being Slavery , which by definition was a legal institution, and jews in nazi Germany who saw legislation enacted against them to facilitate the persecution and genocide. 

Jewish legislation:

http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005681

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws

In our own country in recent times we have the persecution of LGBT , first comes to mind is Alan turing being chemically castrated because it was against the *law* to be gay. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labouchere_Amendment

I could go on and on and on. Minorities should fear Government, and this is why I wanted a weaker one with less speech/expression/association laws. 

&gt;Okay accepting that is our law based on violence? 

The enforcement of law is based on the threat of or actual violence. Nobody wants to be imprisoned but they are because if they resist they will be forced and have violence committed against them.

In respect to the other strikers, Dzeko might step up his game. That man played with such an intensity when the beast and aguero relegated him to a super sub. Bony is no slouch, he'll be pushing for a starting spot as well. I think the attacking side of the game should see an upswing in intensity. Or so I hope. 

I agree with the two ferns. Yaya is aging as amazing as he is. I'm worried that I don't see anything on the wire about a replacement. Developed or bought. I've actually thought that the ferns play better when seperated. Dinho is used to running around like a mad man in the back, cleaning up. But when Nando is out there it looks like they are confused on duties, and who should be attacking. 

Nando doesnt have the ball control to be the pivot in attack. Something that yaya does beautifully. dinho should be able to do it but for some reason, he doesnt explore forward or control the tempo when he's on the field with Nando. Maybe I'm wrong here?

What I mean by a triangle.

Any government that has the ability to pass laws (i.e. every government) has too much power by your standards. 

As for the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany; nazi germany itself rose out of one of the weakest and most democratic governments ever to exist. The Weimar Republic was almost too democratic and was a series of ever more fragile coalitions that collapsed with increasing rapidity. Out of this weak government came one of the most aggressive regimes of modern times. Weak or small government does not stop strong governments emerging, in fact it can actually make it easier for them to emerge.

My argument against your citing of the Jim Crow laws apply to the Labouchere Amendment as well as it was introduced in 1885 where the British government was smaller and less democratic than it is today and yet still managed to persecute minorities very effectively. 

It strikes me that the only government that does have the potential to persecute its citizens is one that does not exist at all. 

The law uses violence as a last resort particularly in the UK and even then it usually involves forced removal of people to court or to prison with the violence being in the moving rather than violence being a punishment in itself. Compare it to a naughty child; a violent punishment would be hitting the child (corporal punishment) where as removing the child to the ""naughty step"" (prison) to isolate them is non-violent punishment. If the child resists being moved to the naughty step the parent can forcefully pick them up and move them there.

For those of us that live with certain issues or environmental stresses ketamine (or methoxetamine and other analogues) are akin to a psychedelic heroin, although unfortunately with more side effects.

Not sure how one would regulate ketamine though, maybe people would be issued a 'drug ID' that when tapped in holds information like age, weight, health issues etc and what drugs the user is prescribed by a doctor (and interactions) what other drugs they are buying and how often- which then flags up people with potentially dangerous use patterns and offers them treatment (its a shame they don't do this for ethanol users really) but the way its always been is that the people selling one of the most harmful drugs around are just in it for the money and don't really care too much about the end user. [""please drink responsibly""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taKSrYPqys8)  

I think if we instead forced people into treatment the outcomes would be worse off then if people were just offered treatment (and information) and chose at the right time to put themselves in instead. 

There would still be many people that opt to use so much ketamine or coke or whatever that they end up in hospital costing the taxpayer  (like ethanol users do already) but they would be doing that regardless and least this way someone is offered treatment they could potentially make use of before its too late.

null,false,nolo_me,null,null,null,"Thanks for the edit. Regarding your first point: it's a little disingenuous to compare legalizing a victimless crime like cannabis use with legalizing a crime of violence. A [pilot study in Lambeth](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctpimr/research/depenalization.pdf) had the following findings:

&gt; We found evidence that the policy caused the police to reallocate effort towards crimes related to the supply of Class-A drugs, as well as reallocating effort towards non-drug crime: there are significant reductions in five types of non-drug crime, and significant improvements in police effectiveness against such crimes as measured by arrest and clear-up rates.

This suggests to me that the reallocation of police resources to more serious crimes would be a major benefit.

&gt; Point 2 is usually that since you can't stop people doing it, you might as well control it. This argument is similar to above in the way that this is not why laws are written. Laws against embezzlement aren't there because it stops embezzlement, they are there to discourage it, to punish those caught doing it, and to reflect the society we live in which frowns upon embezzlement as an activity

Again, embezzlement is not a victimless crime. Laws are written to protect those governed by them. 

&gt; Point 3 is that you can make money by legalising cannabis. The reasons for me disagreeing with this is in two parts. The first the the same as the above points, that it can be applied to any law, yet it never is by those who support it for weed.

You could make money by legalizing assault rifles, but you don't have to support legalizing assault rifles in order to make the same argument for cannabis: that's a false equivalence. 

&gt; The second is that there's no definitive evidence that long term and widespread use of cannabis doesn't result in increased healthcare costs. In the UK an increased burden on the NHS could hypothetically wipe out any gains from taxing cannabis sales. I'm not saying it would, I'm just saying I wouldn't want to definitively say ""It will make us money"" without knowing that it definitely will. 

A 2011 study by the IDMU found that on average the UK consumes 36,579,100 ounces per year. Assuming the rate of consumption remained the same after legalization, and based on the flat tax of £1/gram proposed by CLEAR, that would amount to a revenue of £1.037b in excise duty and £1.36b in VAT for a total of around £2.4b. It's [estimated](http://www.nta.nhs.uk/uploads/alcoholcommentary2013final.pdf) that alcohol-related harm (which includes diseases caused by alcohol, drink-driving, alcohol-fuelled violence and injuries) costs the NHS £3.5b per year. It's fairly safe to say that cannabis use wouldn't begin to approach that figure, based on the existing prevalence of alcohol use vs cannabis use.

&gt; As for alcohol, it's often cited as a point in favour of legalising weed, but I actually think it's a point against it. Smoking a joint once in a while has no negative effects, we can all agree on that. Drinking a pint of beer once in a while has no negative effect, we can all agree on that too. However, Britain has a huge binge drinking problem, which causes liver cancer, costs to the NHS, social problems, and harm to those involved. This is because it is socially acceptable now to go out and binge on alcohol, possibly to avoid thinking about how miserable life can be or in order to relax. I don't see how weed would be any different, there would be no self restraint for a lot of people, just over use.

The differences are as follows: alcohol is a poison on which it is not only possible but trivial to overdose - more than 33,870 people were admitted to hospital because of the toxic effect of alcohol in England in 2012/13, and 360 people died from accidental alcohol poisoning in England in 2011. The number of recorded deaths due to THC overdose in the entire world world is precisely 0.

The Britain of today is different to the Britain of 10 and 20 years ago. Plenty of things have changed, introduction of the minimum wage, devolution to Scotland and Wales, the Good Friday Agreement to name but a few of the more recent ones. 


&gt;What has to happen for you to blame the institution?

An act of genuine stupidity, which the Iraq war comes close to. 


&gt;Selling weapons to human rights offenders? 

Often such things seem terrible on face value and sometimes they are, but more often than not they are clever strategic moves to limit or mitigate other threats. Politicians are not idiot, nor are they evil. 

&gt;Not one party can be blamed.


""*We would all like to believe that our favorite candidate would never have acted so stupidly. It is rarely true. The millions or hundreds of millions of people who make up a nation are constrained by reality. They generate leaders who would not become leaders if they were irrational. Climbing to the top of millions of people is not something fools often do.Politicians are therefore rarely free actors. Their actions are determined by circumstances, and public policy is a response to reality.*"" (G.Friedman) 

&gt;I mean we all know that the 1st past the post system is unfair and dosent work, will it be changed? No!

Oh I agree 100% with you here, I just think that the changes it brings won't be sufficient for many, who perhaps like yourself don't identify or rationalise with our politicians actions.

It always seems to be the types who have plenty to fall back on as well, so many people my age (20's) have mummy and daddy's money to fall back on so they sit there on the dole at home waiting for someone to give them a job they like, instead of going out and at least doing *something*. 

The job center is there to get you into work, not get you a job you like. They *can help* you find a job you like, but if you're applying and you aren't getting offers for things you want, tough shit, you take the first job you're offered that you can do, or you lose your benefits. and that's the way it should be. The benefits system can't support a bunch of hopefuls biding their time for just the right thing, it is effectively emergency support not a convenience.

I would disagree in regards to the chav's preferred choice of targets. Most smaller places might not even have a branded top box/bike so the riders can blend in more. I find that, specifically with Dominoes and Pizza Hut the uniform/gear is just a a scum magnet/target. I would have felt infinitely safer in my own black leathers/textiles. There is something in the psyche of the feral youth of today that triggers a red rag to a bull response when seeing a Dominoes or Pizza Hut Rider in uniform, not even necessarily to steal the scooter/pizza/money, just as a twisted form of fun with nothing else to do and no moral compass. (And thats not even addressing the aggressive behavior some drivers exhibit)

I won't ask you to disclose your area but my experience has been within the M25, that might factor in as small scooters are an everyday part of the traffic composition so an unbranded bike with a plain (or low key) top-box won't register with most people.

As i say though at least Dominos give their riders 125 innovas and not the horrible Peugeot mopeds Pizza Hut riders must endure.

Also as an area manager I emplore you to keep those bikes in good mechanical order. I am aware your policy will likely be for each driver to do a pre-shift check and sign off on a bike prior to working each evening but we both know the reality of a busy shift..",null,0,null,1424283890,null,0,false,0,copfv1v,null,t3_2vtes0,null,t1_copfv1v,null,t1_coous0i,null,null,null,1424660319,null,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2,null

null,false,General_Beauregard,null,null,null,"I like Ramires, and I know Fabregas has a great skill set to play the #10. However, when we play Fab in the 10 role, we don't have anyone else that can distribute nearly as effectively from the holding role.

For example, last night we posed almost no attacking threat through the middle. All of our attacks seemed to go through Matic/Ramires to the fullbacks or wingers, since neither of them has the same killer passing ability as Fabregas. That meant that Fabregas was effectively stranded in the middle, and service to Costa was much more limited.

I understand that Ramires and Mikel are better defensively and that Mourinho wants to be safe in big matches (particular away matches), but it seems counter productive since neither of them can make all of the outlet passes necessary to really relieve the pressure on the back line. 

I don't think many people will argue that Fabregas is one of the absolute best players in the world at passing the ball, but that talent is useless if we can't get it to him in the first place. Unless we sign a more balanced CM, I strongly feel that Fabregas needs to stay in the holding midfield to distribute to our four-headed monster ahead of him.",null,0,null,1424284810,null,0,false,0,copggfp,null,t3_2w8l6s,null,t1_copggfp,null,t3_2w8l6s,null,null,null,1424660596,null,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3,null

null,false,Nymthae,null,null,null,"Most cases involve having a Master's level qualification anyway. The MPhys route is the most common way undergrads hop into a PhD now. If you've not considered a PhD before then it's probably a good idea to actually get an MSc so you can ""try it out"" before signing up for three or four years. I *think* the CDT programs may be more viable as they usually have what is effectively a Master's year - i.e. smaller projects in the same group for a year, so you have the skills to tackle the PhD. You'd have to speak to the directors and see what they think though, i'm not sure (as all I know are undergraduates looking at PhDs with a four year integrated Master's).

The MSc itself usually won't give you much in terms of jobs, although it may help you gain relevant experience for the sector you want to be in as your undergraduate degree is very broad. It's not a complete waste, but it's not necessarily going to promote you to great heights. The problem with the MSc usually is the funding aspect, but I guess you've looked into that. If you want to do pure research roles then PhDs are usually required. Basically, look for jobs you think you might want, or look at people in those jobs: do they have PhDs? If yes, you probably want to consider it.

What research experience do you have? The difference between a 2.1/first isn't really much if it's the difference between a bunch of exams. Exams don't come into it for PhDs, so yeah, they care about your undergraduate grade but the actual skills are different. If you have some research internships then it's probably doable from this position, if not then the MSc is probably worth it. 

Similarly with the PhD/job thing, I guess check out what they say about MSc. From a chemistry point of view, positions either say BSc minimum/MSc is nice/advantage/might get you a few quid more or PhD required.

null,false,lancashire_lad,null,null,null,"&gt; No offence but do you actually trade overseas? 

Not personally, but I've worked closely with a lot of companies that do.

&gt; Because your point about the US providing better opportunities for small and medium sized businesses is a million miles away from practical reality. It's only true for technology products and services. And then mostly services.

Services are already half our exports, and that's only going to increase in the future. When you add in high tech products too, that's a clear majority of our trade.

&gt; Can you describe the difference between a South Korea style deal, EEA and full EU membership? These different trade deals are very different in practice - can't just swap one in and get the same results.

This is a huge question and I could go on at length, but the major differences are on having a common external tariff (EU, but not EEA or bilateral deal), country of origin regulations (EEA and bilateral, but not EU), voting power in EU institutions (EU, but not bilateral or EEA), free movement of labour (EEA and EU, but not bilateral), EU regulation (EU yes, EEA partial, bilateral only for EU exports), membership fees (EU yes, EEA partial, bilateral no). I'm talking here about the Korea deal, because bilateral negotiations could come in all forms, obviously. Korea is the best one so far, but the Canada one could be even better. It all depends on your negotiating leverage - the bigger the economy you are, the more cards you hold versus the EU. 

&gt; You sound like you know a lot of theory and no real world experience....? Is that true?

This is a difficult question to answer, not least because it's hard to distinguish between the two in some cases: if I've interviewed business owners about the problems they're facing, is that theory or practice? I guess I'd say I have quite a broad practical knowledge about the topics involved, but in specific areas, while it's more depth than most academics, it's probably less than someone actively running a business.

As recommend by almost all leading economist. Is there something you know that they don't?

&gt;The government help to buy housing scheme is only delaying the housing bubble bursting and making things worse in the long term as a result.

Now there is a good point. The bubble never did fully deflate and reset itself according to many economist, M, Wolf being one of them.  


&gt;The austerity measures and benefits changes primarily hurt the poor. 

Of course they did, if you are reliant on the state and the state is broke you are going to be in serious trouble. 

&gt;We could easily restructured our budget in different ways that could have saved money without being so painful to the most vulnerable.

**Easily**? How? 


&gt;I could go on.

Do, I am interested to hear an alternate take on leading economic theories and the past 5 years of government, who knows I may change my vote, we are after all in the run up to an election.

In England alone either the lines you want aren't running when you need them, the trains are late, they're typically overcrowded or the fare is simply extortionate to the point that taking the train makes no economic sense at all. 

And that's just in England, the Welsh rail network is an absolute shambles.

null,false,iMac_Hunt,null,null,null,"&gt;It reminds voters – and they really need very little prompting to be reminded of this – that the Tory party is the party of the rich. 

I really don't understand how people jump to this conclusion when the Conservatives want to reduce the welfare state. I can accept that the Conservatives are definitely less sympathetic towards the unemployed compared to Labour, but this does not make them the party of the rich. If anything, it makes them the party of the 'working people', and in fairness many of their policies this term suggest that. For example, increasing the personal allowance. The only policy I can think of this term which purely benefits the rich is reducing the top rate income tax from 50% to 45% (and I believe HMRC found it did not return that much revenue). On the flip side of the coin, a policy which has hit the wealthy is the scrapping of child benefits for households earning over 50k.

State-owned Network Rail probably closed the line for maintenance work

&gt; the trains are late,

Possibly due to the state owned network rail, possibly due to external factors, possibly due to the train company - but the relevant party gets fines thrown at them so it's not in their interests to be late

&gt; they're typically overcrowded

The government probably hasn't let the train company have new trains or allowed them to rip out first class seating yet. In addition, there aren't masses of trains rusting in a yard that could be used (some people think there is), nor can they always ""just put more carriages on""

&gt;  or the fare is simply extortionate to the point that taking the train makes no economic sense at all. 

The government sets fare increases and in its desire to reduce subsidy, has allowed them to increase handsomely

&gt; crusty old carriages

The government (welsh assembly in this instance?) probably hasn't let Arriva buy new trains and/or doesn't want to buy them itself. Unlike a lot of England, at least south Wales is getting newer trains and electrified lines in the near future

&gt;  Good luck getting any sort of regular, on time service from or to anywhere outside of the major Welsh hubs. 

Probably because the welsh government doesn't think there needs to be one. Apart from the special rolls-royce express service that Welsh taxpayers pay for, to primarily ferry WAG members around.

Notice the pattern. A lot of the issues with today's rail network are already thanks to the government's decision making, or lack of.

Yeah we would prolly end up with a term with someone like UKIP. But after that all parties would have to respect the power of the disenfranchised voters. They would need to work on getting their word out to everyone. And often on changing their policies the something palatable to that population. 

They would also find that the failing to stand behind their promised policies would have a much more drematic effect.

&gt;My father Paul Morriss is a father of three and a grandfather of 6 and another on the way. He has worked for the Otago Polytechnic, Taieri Print and various other places in Dunedin and has been a long time member of the Taieri Rotary Club. He has always been the hard working man, the teaching man, the family man and the man who would give you the shirt off his back. Hes not a smoker, hes not a heavy drinker, hes always been fit and active but yet now at age 58 he has been dealt the roughest hand and been diagnosed with terminal cancer. His time is quite limited due to the aggressiveness of the various cancers throughout his body. One of my dads final wishes is to return to his birthplace England to go to a Crystal Palace football game at their home ground, spend some time with his son, daughter in-law and their two young boys, his brother and his elderly parents and say his final goodbyes to them all. So if you would like to do something to help him, me, his parents, his brother, his sons and his grandchildren please be so kind as to make a donation to help us raise enough money to grant one of his wishes and let him tick a few things off the bucket list and say his final goodbyes to his loved ones.

null,false,grelch,null,null,null,"Apologies for the late reply, I actually had to run when I posted last night so I wasn't particularly cogent when I made my comment. To be clear, I wasn't particularly trying to refute what you said AAP, your logic is sound and there's every chance you're correct. When I was talking about the players you mentioned I was referring more to their salaries than to their transfer fees. I think what I wanted to get at on a broader scale (vis a vis the village) was directed more at the supporters base in general and probably David Sullivan in particular. 

To flush out what I was thinking, contextually it's important to remember where the club was when Sam was hired. There is a direct line from point A to point B, point A being on the brink of insolvency to point B playing football in the OS as a side competitive for Euro places. If we did not bounce back from relegation immediately it was very likely that we were heading the way of Portsmouth or Leeds. Our existence as a relevant top flight club was very much in jeopardy. So the Daves gave Sam a very specific management plan when they hired him that was part of their larger business plan. His remit was specific. For the club to survive he had to hit very specific targets. They backed him with the funding he required to do the job, and by and large they left him to his own devices.  I'd wager to say that one by one he's ticked off every line item in that management and progression plan. He's accomplished this using a formula of play that is successful relative to the talent/ value of his team. He almost scuppered his plan last season with his ill advised summer transfer dealings. Nonetheless, he made up for those mistakes this season bringing in an exciting crop of players. But watching his sides from the beginning of his tenure has more often than not been tedious, lugubrious and frustrating. Soul sapping even. It's been worse if you're a season ticket holder.  It's not the product that any of us wants. It is however what Sam told the Daves that we would need to do to be approaching point B at this date in time. He's done what he said he was going to do, what the Daves asked him to do, what we have asked him to do.

So here's where the problem lies, none of us wants to continue playing the kind of football we have been playing the past 4 years, and yet we all want West Ham to consolidate in the top flight except now we want to be competing in the top 6 to 8. We're close to being there, but we're not quite there. We're where we are supposed to be according to the plan of progression. Spot on where we're supposed to be. What's more, we're not yet out of contention for a spot in Europe. We can still get there. But emotions are taking over the decision making process when logic and calm should prevail. We are coming through a long patch of tough fixtures with a threadbare squad. While we had a fantastic start to the season, we need to remember, logically, that many of the sides we beat had poor starts to the season. We peaked while they wallowed. The deeper, more talented, higher value squads will take their places as the season progresses, are taking those positions now. Water seeks its own level. We were over achieving during the first third of the season. We've suffered our rough patch, as we were always going to do, and now we are in a position to push on. 

IMO, we'd be making a big mistake to remove Sam before his job is done. If we let him finish one more season, we will be in a position where the type of manager we're dreaming about actually is willing to consider the prospect. We're not quite there yet. We need a little more patience. We've almost accomplished an incredibly improbable journey from footnote to contender. Hang in there Sullie. The credit will be yours if you do. I guess having said that, while I think 1 more season of Sam is ideal to finish his work, he'll probably want 3 or 4.

&gt;Thanks for the edit. Regarding your first point: it's a little disingenuous to compare legalizing a victimless crime like cannabis use with legalizing a crime of violence....Again, embezzlement is not a victimless crime. Laws are written to protect those governed by them.

There are plenty of laws that aren't there to protect people from other people, and instead are there to protect people from themselves, or alternately, are there to protect the state/society in general rather than specific individuals.

At a fundamental level this is all about why we have laws, and what makes a good law or a bad one. 

Consider though there are already plenty of laws that are ""for our own good"". Unless you support legalisation of ALL drugs, even horrific stuff like [Krokodil](http://time.com/3398086/the-worlds-deadliest-drug-inside-a-krokodil-cookhouse/) then you already back laws protecting people from themselves. If you think it's OK to force motorbike riders to wear helmets, you're already in favour of laws that protect people from themselves.

If you literally believe the government should never, ever, pass a law with the intention of protecting people from their own actions, then sure I'll never convince you. I'll think you're daft, because freedom is a shared delusion at best, but I can't really change that.

&gt;A pilot study in Lambeth had the following findings...This suggests to me that the reallocation of police resources to more serious crimes would be a major benefit.

Firstly, I'd like to say while that pilot study is interesting, it's still a pilot study, in one specific area, over a short period of time. So I'm not going to change my opinion regarding drugs based on a pilot study.

Secondly, the pilot study is for *decriminalisation* not *legalisation*. The only reason to support decriminalisation is to ensure police time is better spent, that we don't ruin lives with criminal records for no good reason, and that people who break the law are rehabilitated rather than just punished. I'm in favour of achieving those goals, just not through decriminalising things. I want a better UK justice system that handles minor and major crimes better *all around* not just specifically drug use. Driving offences, public affrays, drinking offences, there's loads of stuff that can really screw you over if you're arrested, but I think those people shouldn't have their actions ""decriminalised"", but we should have a justice system that takes people who breaks the law and rehabilitates them.

Thirdly, the pilot itself said:

&gt;We found that depenalization in Lambeth led to significant increases in cannabis possession occurrences that persisted well after the policy experiment ended. ... Despite the overall fall in crime attributable to the policy, we found the total welfare of local residents likely fell, as measured by house prices. These welfare losses are concentrated in Lambeth zip codes where the illicit drug market was most active.

So what they are saying is in the area where it wasn't legalised, just decriminalised, more people were using it, and illegal drug dealers benefited from it more. To me this suggests you either need to fully legalise it, or need to keep it illegal. At the end of the article they try to claim it would be more successful if the entire city did it, but that rather undermines the purpose of the pilot study if they themselves are saying the pilot study wasn't a true representation of the effects. You can't just say ""Well the good effects would be replicated, but the bad ones would all disappear if everywhere did it"" as that isn't academic at all, it's just conjecture.

&gt;You could make money by legalizing assault rifles, but you don't have to support legalizing assault rifles in order to make the same argument for cannabis: that's a false equivalence.

Sorry but it's not a false equivalence at all. Ignoring the fact you've tried to bring up a logical fallacy in an internet discussion, it's also wrong. If you look at the Wikipedia article:

&gt;False equivalence is a logical fallacy which describes a situation where there is a logical and apparent equivalence, but when in fact there is none. This fallacy is categorized as a fallacy of inconsistency. ... A common way for this fallacy to be perpetuated is one shared trait between two subjects is assumed to show equivalence, especially in order of magnitude, when equivalence is not necessarily the logical result.

My point is that if your basis of your reasoning is that weed should be legalised because it makes money, then you cannot apply that inconsistently to all laws. I'm sure your counter argument is that you believe that there is more damage caused by legalising weed than assault rifles, in which case the basis of your argument isn't that you can make money of making weed legal, but rather the harm (or lack therefore) of smoking it.

&gt;A 2011 study by the IDMU found that on average the UK consumes 36,579,100 ounces per year. Assuming the rate of consumption remained the same after legalization, and based on the flat tax of £1/gram proposed by CLEAR, that would amount to a revenue of £1.037b in excise duty and £1.36b in VAT for a total of around £2.4b. It's estimated that alcohol-related harm (which includes diseases caused by alcohol, drink-driving, alcohol-fuelled violence and injuries) costs the NHS £3.5b per year. It's fairly safe to say that cannabis use wouldn't begin to approach that figure, based on the existing prevalence of alcohol use vs cannabis use. 

...

&gt;The differences are as follows: alcohol is a poison on which it is not only possible but trivial to overdose - more than 33,870 people were admitted to hospital because of the toxic effect of alcohol in England in 2012/13, and 360 people died from accidental alcohol poisoning in England in 2011. The number of recorded deaths due to THC overdose in the entire world world is precisely 0.

Firstly, your figures are assuming that consumption levels and patterns remain the same post legalisation/decriminalisation, which it's not likely they would. Yes this does mean that it's likely that it would bring in even more tax, but it also means that you're already assuming the side effects of weed will be the same as they are now, which they wouldn't be. Your own pilot study shows consumption ""significantly increased"" (up to 61% actually) due to decriminalisation. In fact you can see the increase in usage already thanks to legalisation in [Colorado](http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_27212493/marijuana-use-increases-colorado-according-new-federal-survey).

Which leads me onto the point that no one really knows what the long term effects of legalisation are. The US (well two states) and Uruguay have taken brave and risky first steps which they are hoping will combat the problem in the ways that pro legalisation activists say it will. In fact there's a whole host of factors we haven't even began to see the effects of yet. What is the effect on economic productivity? Will people binge on it, if so will there be long term memory effects? Will smoking weed become a social norm like alcohol and tobacco, which leads to children smoking it illegally (which would stunt their development)? 

There is a whole host of questions that I'm not convinced are answered or even can be answered right now. I've seen the effects of heavy weed use on people, and I've seen a lot of scientific articles arguing that weed is or isn't harmful. Most people will say ""yeah but it's not harmful in moderation"", but nothing is harmful in moderation. The problem is when it becomes socially acceptable the game totally changes. Over generations when your baby sitter comes over they are high, but their parents don't mind as they get high all the time too. You may think that's panic or scaremongering, but in the 1950s smoking was certainly extremely common too. No I'm not saying people are going to be smoking bongs in front of their 6 year olds, but the point is who knows what happens if it catches on like alcohol and tobacco have?

Most of the arguments people present cannot be equally applied to other laws without them saying ""Yeah but I think it's ok to apply it to weed"". There may be some super libertarian person who thinks that there should basically be no government, in which case I'm not going to see eye to eye with them on just about anything, but most people don't actually believe what they say as the very basis of the argument for legalisation, because the moment you apply it to hand guns, seat belts, harder more dangerous drugs, they tend to say ""oh yeah but that's different because that's dangerous"". 

I know why I think laws should be made, and it's not because it makes money, or because people will do it anyway, it's because you believe the law will be a benefit to society in general, and will represent society's views. For most people the argument really boils down to that they think it will be beneficial to legalise it for a set of reasons that are not conclusive. There is no evidence that ""secondary"" crime is lowered as a result of decriminalisation/legalisation, there's no evidence that increased consumption and social acceptance wont lead to damaging side effects for society. If the drug was already legal, I wouldn't be campaigning to criminalise it, but I don't think the evidence is sufficient to risk the potential outcomes from decriminalising it either.

As it boils down to how harmful/harmless the drug is, unless scientists pretty much unanimously say it has no long term side effects on people  (e.g. climate change is pretty much unanimously accepted as true) or Colorado and other areas that have legalised it show long term (like 10-15 year) benefits from it I'm not going to be convinced.",null,0,null,1424290744,null,0,false,0,copk9qt,null,t3_2wadad,null,t1_copk9qt,null,t1_copfge1,null,null,null,1424662376,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

null,false,Ouro,null,null,null,"I have to be a bit circumspect, but i just wanted to add that the issues the surgeon identifies, e.g. the problem with lack of bed/ITU space and the staff to go along with them, are problems probably seen across the NHS, even as a lowly minion I am quite conscious of the almost competition that goes on for beds. I have certainly seen examples of the problems he identifies where I work. 

A lot of the focus in the media of late has been a mantra that the problems in the NHS have been down to feckless people going to A&amp;E with trivial complaints and tying up hospital and ambulance service staff. While this is no doubt a factor, its only a superficial examination of the problem. A&amp;E is the front door to the hospital, but if you're not getting people leaving by the back door (being discharged) then however much to try to discourage new arrivals, you are going to have problems i.e. bed blockers - which is an awful thing to call often elderly people who are more in need of social/community care, who are fit enough to leave where it not for a lack of social care or other support to enable them to leave, Its an awful thing to call them because its placing them at fault for the situation, when its an issue with the system,. The NHS is a great institution, one that Im proud to work for, but there does seem to be a problem with its conception, that social care was not included in its mandate and that while focusing upon regional centres of excellence is a good thing, closing down all the small and community hospitals where the mostly fit could recuperate was a bad idea.

I work in quite a priviliged situation where for a few hours that patient has the most attention, the highest number of staff dedicated to looking after them for their entire time in hospital. The Francis and other reports have looked into failings in nursing care, quite appalling things that have occurred. Perhaps Im just not jaded/experienced enough, but I have yet to meet a nurse that doesnt care for patients. Certainly there is a variable level in capability and differences in practice, but all do work hard to care for patients. What I do see though are overworked nurses and understaffed wards. I understand one of the biggest reason recently qualified student nurses quit after qualifying is the discrepancy between what they know they should be doing to provide high quality care and what they are actually able to do. That they are forced into a dilemma of whether they provide hih quality of care for a few patients e.g keeping that dying patient company in their last hours or providing a basic safe level of care for all their patients. While throwing extra staff/beds at the situation wont resolve matters, there does seem to be a need for a lot more staff.

The system is running flat out, often on the backs of staff who continually go the extra mile to keep things running, Sometimes I worry about what would happen were there to be some significant major incident.

null,false,hexapodium,null,null,null,"Welfare state stuff entirely aside (because there's an aspect of murky ideology to it), the Tories very definitely are the party of the rich - economically, their policy privileges the interests of capital owners over the interests of those who don't, i.e. a low-inflation but QE driven monetary policy; a focus on an asset-value-led recovery rather than a wage-led one; union-busting policy with the effect of reducing the power of (necessarily diffuse) human capital in contrast to (arbitrarily concentrateable) financial capital. 

There's also the (dis-)equity aspect of the Tory project of the rolling back of the state: predominantly this occurs in sectors which still need to be done for the sake of the nation as a whole (housing, railways, health, postal service) or which would sacrifice enormous gains were they not embarked upon (coal and gas extraction, steel, aerospace, science funding). The withdrawal of state enterprise from these draws in investment *from those who already have the money to spare*, and even if we apply a thoroughly baseless assumption and suggest that the state and the private sector provide an exactly equal service for equal costs, the gains which would accrue as a budget surplus for a nationalised enterprise (and thus slowly filter back to the taxpayer via cross-subsidy) are instead redirected to a smaller group of people who had more money to start with. 

The talk about the (contemporary) Tories being the ""party of the working"", set up against ""the scrounger"", is essentially bunk - if you look at the [real terms rate of pay increase (PDF link)](http://t.co/9ucbkuDASn) and note how it remained below zero even in the years past 2009, it's axiomatic that the UK's real-terms GDP growth in 2010-2012 must have come from unearned income (i.e. rent accruing to capital)[1], which amounts to giving money to the people who have capital assets rather than to those who have only labour assets (i.e. 35 hours per week, working). The average worker without significant assets has much more, economically speaking, in common with the ""scrounger"" on benefits (especially in the current conditional-benefits climate), than they do with the capital-owning portion of society; within the capital owners, those whose major asset is their own home again are far closer to the worker and the claimant (because you don't sell your own house except to buy another house, and so houses are essentially priced in terms of houses; their nominal value only matters to first time buyers and landlords), than to those who own liquid or semi-liquid assets which can be moved around and directly invested. It's no mistake, then, to note that most of the Tories' major donors (who are, let's not be coy, buying influence) are members of this, last group of people with very large capital holdings in disposable and transformable assets. These are the people who mostly benefit from increases in returns to capital, and the Tories have enacted economic and fiscal policy in this Parliament which has driven the economy to grow near-exclusively in that manner, rather than in one which would also have pushed up real-terms wages.

As far as I'm concerned 8 percent vs 11 percent is pretty much the same for chance of making the top four. As such I think we shouldn't focus on either but try and beat Beskitas here with a solid defensive team that doesn't feature too many first team players. Now due to injury we must start Hendo and Allen for both games. I suspect we will thus sub Can in for one or the other in this game to give them some rest. I'm this pretty confident that our back line will be:
Kolo Skrtle Lovren or Sakho. This then gives us the option to sub Cna in for one of the defenders of need be/ if we are winning by a lot we can sub in a kid in midfield and him in the back. On the wing markovic is banned which is fine since Ibe can play there today and Markovic on Sunday. I'd select Enrique over Moreno for rotations sake. We need to basically try and sub both Allen and Hendo if we can and playing Enrique allows us to do that if need be. Finally up top I think we'll either see Rodgers play Coutinho Lallana Balo and Sub Studge in for Coutinho or Lallana or start Sturdige and sub him out.

Thus we'd have:
Migs
      Kolo - Skrtle - Lovren
Ibe Allen Hendrson. Enrique
       Lallana Countiho
             Balo

with Can and Sturdidge free to sub in and still play Sunday and also allow Hendo and Allen a rest. This also gives Moreno a rest and Markovic can come in at the weekend too.

it should be fine if you haven't ridden far, but to check just grab the front sprocket and check if there is any play by trying to move it up and down, it should be completely solid and not move.

The stat you quoted may be because Churchill fishes a lot of people from the pool system, I and a fair few people I know got in through that.  

Churchill is pretty damn comfy to live in. It may not look like Hogwarts but it has fairly sizeable, nicely equipped rooms. The JCR is well organised and the premises have good facilities for pretty much everything including sports.  Food in hall got a lot better during my stay there, it is actually quite tasty and cheap, and formals are usually fairly exciting. Living a short bikeride away from the centre of town is fine, realistically, in any other university city you would expect to live at least that far from the big shops or the campus. That, and in 3rd (and 4th if you get in) year you are literally a 2 min walk away from where the lectures are held, and that is just glorious.  

It is quite a maths and science friendly college in general, a large number of people in Churchill are natscis and engineers, a fair few mathmos and a couple of medics, all fairly reasonable and hard working. Churchill achieves good rankings academically, it is known for its good work ethics. Not that Churchillians don't also party a lot, there's always a few, until recently Churchill had the only free, weekly student club night held on the premises, the form has changed but the spirit remains I imagine.

null,false,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,null,"&gt; I can accept that the Conservatives are definitely less sympathetic towards the unemployed compared to Labour, but this does not make them the party of the rich. If anything, it makes them the party of the 'working people'

The Tories welfare changes have hurt the working poor as well as the unemployed, and their [plans for the next parliment](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/02/ministers-are-reaching-beyond-scroungers-and-aiming-britain-s-working-poor) will be horrendous for the working poor.

They also raised VAT, which has increased working and unemployed people's shopping bills and is a regressive tax.

They've attacked the pay and conditions of public sector workers, as well as laying many off. In the private sector, wages have also fallen in real terms. If they're the party of the working people and not of the rich, they have to explain why working people have gotten worse off under them but the richest have gotten richer.

&gt; their policies this term suggest that. For example, increasing the personal allowance. 

Increasing the personal tax allowance was a Lib Dem policy, before they went into coalition the Tories rejected it on the grounds it was unaffordable. 

&gt; The only policy I can think of this term which purely benefits the rich is reducing the top rate income tax from 50% to 45% (and I believe HMRC found it did not return that much revenue)

Yes, but isn't it telling that with all the ""necessary"" cuts and tax raises elsewhere, they decided to make that the priority. Remember, this was the same budget they introduced the infamous pasty tax. 

They've also lowered corporation tax for big businesses from 28% to 21% but left it at 20% for small businesses, so there's a gift to big business there but nothing for smaller businesses.

Many people suspect, and the Tories have themselves indicated, they would have been more of a ""party of the rich"" if it weren't for the Lib Dems - for example they would have cut the 50p tax rate to 40p, and scrapped or greatly increased the inheritance tax threshold, which sounds nice but would only benefit those with more than £325k to pass on and would mean extra savings would have to come from elsewhere.",null,0,null,1424293835,null,0,1424294390,0,copm9ju,null,t3_2wbpgp,null,t1_copm9ju,null,t1_copj0nk,null,null,null,1424663306,null,26,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,26,null

In general i'd say people are more serious there, probably due to moderation.  The community there is also more well established with many people who have been supporters for many decades, as that site has been there since before Reddit existed.  Because of the seemingly larger scope of that community, you are going to have more varying/wacky opinions.  Here on reddit, wacky opinions get downvoted so you just don't even know about them.

That being said, I think this sub keeps getting better and better.  I really believe the main reason people came to reddit is because the UX is a million times better.  Over there you gotta click on the Audio Video thread for example, and go to the last page to see if anything new has been posted.  Then you gotta remember what page you were last on, etc.  Here new content is just right on the front page of the sub.  You can have good conversation here, AND find good news.

EDIT: Oh yea and as an experiment, I'd recommend reading post match threads on both sites.  That will give you a great idea of what the main differences are as far as community mentality.  For example, earlier this season, I had the feeling that the RAWK crowd was much more patient with BR than this sub was.

Too tight: Yes it can - [this fella does a great job at explaining why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_CyM-Ed8PA). If you're on a YBR, the chain does seem excessively slack on inspection - even when it's on the limits of how tight it should be as detailed in the owners handbook/Haynes manual. That said, it runs absolutely fine and when I've had the bike serviced it's come back with that amount of slack as well so - even though it may appear slack - it's actually in limits.

Replace chain/sprockets: Yes you should. By changing a chain without changing the sprocket set, you can cause premature wear on the sprockets. A new DID chain/sprocket set would set you back £30-£40, so it's not a huge amount of money if it needs doing.

Side point, if your chain has surface rust on the sides of the links this is fine and can normally be treated with a gentle bit of WD40 (note - don't use WD40 as a chain lube itself as it's bad for the O ring seals) and an old toothbrush.

Yeah they lucked out there.

&gt; Osbourne and the Tories are going too look very strong going into this election.

They're still behind in the polls though, Labour/SNP coalition looks like the most likely outcome at the moment.

&gt; Plus we must also remember that an overwhelming percentage of the electorate agree with austerity.

I can believe they did before the 2010 elections when the Tories were promising all savings would come from ""efficiency savings"" and nobody would suffer, now we've all seen the effects austerity has had I no longer believe that is the case. 

Besides, there are different scales of austerity. Both Labour and the Tories are offering austerity but quite different amounts, the Tories insist all deficit reduction must come from spending cuts, whereas Labour also want to raise taxes and cut the deficit over a longer period. I think many people will feel Tory austerity will less kind to those in need. Of course, if people don't believe we should have any more austerity they can always vote Green (or the SNP in Scotland).

&gt; Oh and pre recession GDP per capita will be reached at some point this year according to IMF forecasts in October.

Do they factor in that Tory austerity may jeopardise the recovery in 2015 as it did in 2010? They are easing off now of course since they want to win the election, but there will be incredibly harsh cuts in 2015 if they win as they try and cut the deficit by £96 billion in 3 years.

Aston Villa wasted no time in finding a replacement for sacked manager Paul Lambert and their predictable choice is Tim Sherwood, the favourite for every Premier League vacancy since he left Tottenham Hotspur. In this week's show, Chris and Steve discuss the appointment with mixed feelings. Above all else, the simple fact that there's been a change has cheered us up some.

&gt;Meanwhile, the football matches are arriving thick and fast.

In short, you slacken the wheel axle bolt and the rear brake bracket so the wheel can move forwards towards the handlebars or backwards away from the handlebars. You then adjust the distance (from the handlebars) by adjusting two little screws on each side of the wheel *by equal amounts* - by turning these screws you are pulling the wheel forward/pushing it backwards as required.

Free speech is wonderfully counterintuitive.  It's the most natural thing in the world to think that banning truly bad ideas is a good way to limit their spread.  I agree- it *seems* like common sense, but common sense can be deceptive.

I've tried to give a flavor of the arguments for free-speech, but I can only scratch the surface in a reddit comment.  If you want a real understanding of the concepts involved then I don't think you can do better than to read a few books on the subject.  My personal favorite is 'Kindly Inquisitors' by Jon Rauch, who lays out the philosophical arguments.  

I hope that the above doesn't read like an 'appeal to authority' BTW.  I'm not claiming that you should be convinced by this, or any of my comments.  In fact, as a practicing fallabilist I have to accept that *everything* I say could in principle be wrong, and that includes my thoughts on free-speech.",null,0,null,1424296184,null,0,false,0,copnsph,null,t3_2w7684,null,t1_copnsph,null,t1_copnbg6,null,null,null,1424664092,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Archaeological evidence at Glastonbury Tor revealed that there was no building on the site until the 10th century. The original structure was wooden and was destroyed in an earthquake in the 13th century, at which time it was replaced by a stone church, the remains of which can be seen there today.

To post a link, you either have to do it as a link post (so just put the URL in the link), and if you want to then add a comment, you can add one in the comments section with your thoughts etc. - usually people will upvote an OP's comment if they are saying something about why they submitted the link. Otherwise, you can submit it as a text post, provide the link to whatever you want to link to inside the text (either as a URL, or you can use Reddit's formatting to turn the link into a hyperlink by putting square brackets around the text you want to display; e.g. [Reddit], and then putting regular brackets around the URL, e.g. (http://www.reddit.com), in this arrangement [text](URL), and then say whatever you want about the link as part of the text post. Self posts don't earn you link karma, but frankly unless you're only posting to gain karma, that isn't a big deal.

Hope that helps!

I am against many of the sanctions that they have introduced, as I believe they are way too harsh for when people have made a single mistake. The appeal process also takes too long. However I don't believe they were done with bad intentions, which is to ensure that people receiving money from the state are playing by the rules. Again, while I disagree with the tories on this I don't believe that this makes them a 'party of the rich', this is just a party which wants to reduce the welfare bill.

&gt;They also raised VAT, which has increased working and unemployed people's shopping bills and is a regressive tax.

Entirely depends at how you look at it. The BBC have a good [article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12111507) on it. It's actually a progressive tax if you consider how the tax affects expenditure groups. 

&gt;Increasing the personal tax allowance was a Lib Dem policy, before they went into coalition the Tories rejected it on the grounds it was unaffordable.

Fair point, although that do want to increase it again if they win the election. 

&gt;They've also lowered corporation tax for big businesses from 28% to 21% but left it at 20% for small businesses, so there's a gift to big business there but nothing for smaller businesses.

This doesn't really have anything to do with being 'the party of the rich' either. I guess the reason people might this is because they associate CEO's of big companies with big salaries. However there's plenty of small business owners who have a lot of money too. Their argument would be that big businesses hire lots of people and taxing them highly for higher profits is unfair.

&gt;Yes, but isn't it telling that with all the ""necessary"" cuts and tax raises elsewhere, they decided to make that the priority.
 
I guess the whole issue is that the ideology in the conservative party is based around the fact that a low tax and pro-business economy is what will increase economic growth which in turn makes people wealthier. They believe that a large welfare state will simply create a poverty cycle and the poorest in society will not become wealthier.

Just to reiterate, I'm not a huge fan of the conservatives, however I still do not think they are 'the party of the rich'.",null,0,null,1424298103,null,0,false,0,copp0h6,null,t3_2wbpgp,null,t1_copp0h6,null,t1_copm9ju,null,null,null,1424664683,null,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4,null

They did, it going to give us all a nice big stimulus for free though


&gt;They're still behind in the polls though, Labour/SNP coalition looks like the most likely outcome at the moment.

It does, however many commentators fear Labour is falling behind rather than gaining. 


&gt;now we've all seen the effects austerity has had I no longer believe that is the case.

Well apparently so, I forget where I heard it, I think Martin Wolf, but the government as being praised for its ability to sell austerity.

&gt;Besides, there are different scales of austerity. 

There are. The Tory plan exerts more social damage at the advantage of shoring up the economy against future crisis and risks much faster. Labour takes what could be considered as the opposite plan, reducing social costs by increasing the future risks and longevity of debt. 
The big questions for me are...    
*  Firstly can we **trust** Labour to use the deficit for extra investment, or is it being spent to lessen the pain on social services and there in buy votes? 
* Secondly how **risky** are these extra £25billion in cuts the Conservatives are making, how much demand do we face to loose? 
* Thirdly and most importantly IMO, what are the **risks** to our economy, is it wise for Labour to leave a deficit and not pay down on debt?


&gt;Do they factor in that Tory austerity may jeopardise the recovery in 2015 as it did in 2010?

Nothing I can see will stop us achieving it, according to the IMF we very very close.


&gt;there will be incredibly harsh cuts in 2015 if they win

Most of these cuts going to be the same who ever is in power, it all comes down to that extra £25Bn after 2016.


&gt;It's worth remembering on this last point that it was also the IMF warned the Tories that sticking to their original deficit reduction plan was jeopardising the recovery a few years ago.

Yes, although the UK does appear to have weather the storm of austerity rather well.  ",null,0,null,1424300022,null,0,false,0,copq6ix,null,t3_2watsl,null,t1_copq6ix,null,t1_copnikv,null,null,null,1424665228,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Currently trying to get written proof of a few things including acknowledgement of damages caused by previous tenants, but at this stage it was just verbal. Every time i text/email her she calls me back, or asks to meet in person. Will keep pushing on this as i've explained i need it in writing to send out to the other flatmates, however no luck so far.

Ive just confirmedDPS contact is an existing flatmate (previously head tenant) who is leaving at the same time as the rest of us, so we could get this transferred. However, some have mentioned the landlord may be at fault for not re-protecting the deposit when we took over tenancy and updating the DPS contract to our names - should i leave as is for proof or is it safer to just have everything under our names for now?

Definitely planning to argue the damage she has mentioned so far (mainly mould/carpets/floors etc), and get proof of anything missing. I've asked a few times for a list of the original contents to get an idea, but she hasn't provided one yet. She has suggested she could arrange a visit this weekend to inspect the flat and write down what has changed, but I'm not sure if there is any point in doing this before we do our full clean and inspection at the end of the tenancy in a couple of months.

Interesting note, she called today to suggest she will need at least our whole deposit to repair the damage (around £3500) but feels sympathetic to our case and would be prepared to ask for only £2000 and pay the remainder. Sounds like she is keen to settle this prior to DPS getting involved, and the flatmates are keen to argue this still shouldn't lie with us - but given the situation of everyone's bond not going via the landlord i do wonder what the value of this could be?

Backbeat Records.

Backbeat Records probably has the best selection but it really is a colossal pain in the cock to look through them as they are piled everywhere head high in boxes, with a system only the eccentric owner understands. It has been like that for 20 years. He doesn't grasp ""browsing"". Which is one of the joys looking through records. Finding some weird stuff and thinking you'll buy it for the hell of it and finding out you like it. 

A lot of the joy is gone out of that these days as you can just go on YouTube and hear pretty much anything to see if you like it. Then torrent it or go on eBay and buy the vinyl of it. Nothing compares to looking through records. 

Funnily enough as a result of this, the selection in charity shops has got better - so go to Morningside, Leith, Newington etc and have a look through them.

Any firm employing you will want to make a profit from your employment (at least by some route) so you want to maximise holiday/pay because they shouldn't make a profit from you without you getting your maximal ""cut""?

Well, people are greedy and often want to maximise holiday/pay. Sometimes they will make a trade-off between the two. For example there are financial sector jobs where you will be hugely rewarded but in turn you will work very hard indeed.

But people also enjoy doing certain things sometimes. Rather than merely having a job, they have a *vocation*. If you are going to work for a living you may as well enjoy what you do.

In addition to this there is a certain amount of pride people take in their jobs. Few want to do their job badly (although plenty do, allegedly!). It generally feels better to know you did well than you did not.

So the reasons people might put in longer hours are not just because they are silly or enjoy making other people money.

So much of what I have said is relative, and hugely dependent on what job you do. There are roles out there where you would never want to do more than your hours, or where you could hardly feel pride or even be motivated to do a good job.

If helping people is your thing, if it really motivates you, then maybe consider a job where you can get a kick from making people's lives better.

As far as I'm aware there are 3 layers, Network Rail own the infrastructure (tracks and stations). 

Train Operating Companies lease the rolling stock (trains) and run the services: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_operating_company#Current_operators


When privatisation occurred the rolling stock was sold to Rolling Stock Operating Companies who own the trains and lease them to the TOCs. At present there are 3 companies:

Angel Trains (Owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland)

Eversholt Rail Group (owned by HSBC)

PorterBrook (Was owned by the Abbey National Bank but was sold to the German finance company Allianz last October).


Over the years there have been investigations, white papers and referrals to the Competition Commission on the basis that they are acting as an oligopoly to keep lease prices higher than would be the case in a more competitive market and therefore the TOCs must pass the costs to the customer.

And isn't it a little worrying that an MP is happy to admit that he usually does that?

Also, I think he may be seeing malice where there's really just incompetence. It all seems to come down to David Cameron perhaps getting a little confused at PMQs and appearing to agree to a vote specifically on the EAW (which would sort of be impossible anyway) rather than on the criminal justice measures.

Oh dear, and now at 3.10, Yvette Cooper seems to be making stuff up as well; the EAW was never in the list of stuff published before Parliament a few weeks earlier.

And Labour's attempt to block a policy they support merely to embarrass the Government.

Why?  Clearly, all religions claim that god is comprehensible to quite a large extent.  The bible claims he looks like us and has similar emotions and motives.  

&gt;What's to say in another hundred years we discover a higher dimension, in which there is an omnipotent being? 

You have to stop abusing the term dimension.  If you're going to keep using that term, at least bother to learn what it is instead of relying on hollywood scifi films.  God is often described as being supernatural, ie. magical, and not limited to any natural laws of science.  So, which is it?  Is god confined to natural laws of science or magic?  It can't be both.

&gt;Can you see what I'm trying to say here?

Yes, you're using the god of the gaps argument.  As our understanding of the universe increases, this god becomes smaller and smaller and smaller.  First he controlled the sun, stars, moon, dictated every single motion and action, but now he's confined to some undiscovered ""dimension"" (universe?).

In hundreds of years, we'll learn yet more about our universe.  If at that point there is still no sign of a god, would you still claim he's still just around the corner somewhere?

&gt;Hate the people who misuse religion as a tool to control and manipulate people, not religion itself.

Are they misusing religion?  Ask yourself why is it such an effective tool for those who want to spread hatred, violence, poverty, hardship, war, terror, etc.  Few things are anywhere near as effective.

And what of those who commit evil because of their religion?

&gt; There are so many truly good religious people out there; doctors, physicists, engineers, philosophers and it's so pointless to **hate** and belittle them

Where did anyone talk of hating theists?  Is this just a slip to reveal your own persecution complex?

Also, I'm not sure why you conflate ""good"" with ""doctors, physicists, engineers, philosophers"".

&gt;when you think about the horrific stuff that religion causes

It's good of you to admit to that, but you really are contradicting yourself.

If you look at any period of time, in so many cultures across the world, religion or belief in a higher power of some sort, is something that unites so many folks. I just think its too easy and simplistic to dismiss stuff that we can't prove or disprove and assume no. No ones proved or disproved aliens, but many people believe in them existing too. I'm just arguing that dismissing religion just because you yourself can be argued as being close minded too 

and I should have worded it better, its not evidence for you to believe it, its evidence for them to believe. Something extraordinary happening, or something spiritual happening to them or something. Its something that convinced them of a higher power.

They are also really well made, so this one wins for best made, washable regularly etc. Top quality. (They also sell traditional red scarves! Don't worry)

If you go by Anfield, you'll find match scarves by the hundreds. From stalls to lone-guys with boxes of them flogging. The quality is hit-and-miss so you want to ask to look at it first and have a feel.

Finally, walking around city centre you'll find stalls where you can buy both LFC and Everton memorabilia. I find it quite disgusting how there is this one stall outside Boots where this guy sells both teams' scarves. I hate that. He's not a fucking supporter, he doesn't care less. 

Anyway, I recently bought a Shankly scalf from a stall in city centre, so not from the LFC store and not from outside Anfield - it's really fucking nice and has his face on both ends, a quote or two from him about Liverpool FC and what it means to the people, one being ""I was made for Liverpool. Liverpool was made for me' and SHANKLY as the main header. It's really nice, I might take a photo and upload if you guys want? It's also really well made - I compared it to a Sturridge scalf a guy bought from outside Anfield and actually mine was the better quality one, the tassles on the ends and the thickness was overall better quality.

Anyway, sorry for the big write up - I get carried away in my passion.

A wide range of things, starting from the earliest possible time we can affect change, and the period when the child is most susceptible to the impacts of obesity - conception and *in utero* development.  

I'm part of a research group in Southampton who look at the ways these very early time periods can be critical in determining the path the child will follow after birth and into their adult lives.  As a result most of us in the field believe targeting young women just before child-bearing age is paramount.  

As well as this, I believe we need to look more critically on the societal pressures that influence food intake and reduce activity.  Things like advertising of cheap low-satiety, high-energy foods and drinks, or barriers to getting people to exert energy in the environment instead of relying of mechanisation.

Surely they must have known their only chance at power was in a coalition, this means compromises at best or broken promises at worst if you decide to make big grandstanding promises during the campaign...


And they did, they made tuition fees their centrepiece promise and even made all their famous faces sign a pledge to that end, and what happens pretty swiftly after the election? The coalition increases fees while the big publicity concession the Lib Dems got was a referendum on AV that couldn't have been further from a household issue if it tried.

Why?  If a group of people suddenly decided to worship leprechauns, would that really alter whether that idea is ridiculous or not?

&gt;Religion shapes worldviews, it is a prism in which a person sees the world through, its the scale of the opinion that, for me at least is the distinction.

Again, how does this prevent an idea like religion being ridiculous?  Cultures can be ridiculous.  World views too.  So, why not a religion?

Aliens don't contradict science.  In fact, our scientific understanding means the existence of aliens somewhere out there is actually likely.

However there was a recent victory in Parliament about this matter, [in which the government lost the vote](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2014/nov/18/coopers-immigration-speech-mays-policing-speech-politics-live-blog#block-546b7306e4b06794f962e4ec) despite the intense lobbying of the PubCos who said this was basically going to ruin their business model and [will lead to plague, pestilence, and death](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6d813892-6f4b-11e4-8d86-00144feabdc0.html).

1) It helps tenants in PubCos.

2) It shows how heartless those at the centre of our government are because the current situation is so bad that 17 Conservative MPs voted against government orders to support this bill - even though  it had nothing to do with Europe!

You can also contact the [Pubs Advisory Service](http://www.pubsadvisoryservice.org.uk/) who can offer far greater help as this is a very specialist and little-known about area; although the forum on their web site looks a little dead.

The only other real source of help I can think of is the GMB Union, they actually have [special packages](http://www.gmbyorkshire.org.uk/gmb-at-work/pub-tennants/) for PubCo tenants.

I think in general the RAWK community is probably just a lot older and more experienced as football fans - forums are something of an old hat form of internet community these days compared to Reddit. Reddit will pull quite a lot of people who have gotten into football recently, because anyone getting into it right now is more likely to end up here, whilst I'd expect that the majority of people on RAWK have been there for years already and their influx of new members is fairly low. You only have to randomly click on currently online members, and most of them have joined before 2010, quite a few pre-dating this subreddit, as you say.

For anyone who has been a Liverpool fan since, say, the late Rafa era, I could understand why they'd perhaps not have all that much patience with BR - after all, pretty much any manager to have a shitty run with the team hasn't stuck around all that long. On the other hand I'd imagine most RAWK members were supporters of the team in the late 90s and have a lot more experience with the club of us being thoroughly mediocre, and a lot more patience and scepticism over the sort of knee-jerk reactions that go on over here.

Lending restrictions also helped keep a lid on crazy house price fluctuations, 3.5 times wage multiple was around the max you could borrow, but the neo lib mantra of deregulating has lead to such craziness as interest only mortgages and repayments at 10 times multiples of wages, bidding up the cost of housing in quick order. 

Wages have not risen in line with this increase, inflation is not eroding the debts away like in the past, you only have to see this new world of deflation to realize we are not going to get meaningful pay inflation anytime soon. 
Only the props remain to stop the whole market from crashing, how long they can last is anyone's guess, but the restrictive and self interested building policies favoring the Boomers over all others is pretty disgusting to see, especially after the example their own parents left.

Some people are good because of the religious values instilled in them, they might still be good without them but the person that they are right now is partially because they were raised religious, or that they drew morals from another source. Maybe that they draw meaning from religion. This is not a bad thing. 

I'm not religious at all, I don't care either way personally, I'm just a good person. Partly because my parents raised me In an incredibly loving, religious household. Partly because of my own views on the world, which are unarguably shaped by the religion I was exposed to. But also from my own critical thinking. Not everyone is capable or willing to engage in this kind of thought and real religion can be a great moral foundation for people. Everyone seems to hang on the Old Testament God and what a dick he was, which is true, no doubt. But The New Testament had one rule, love one another as I love you. That simple rule is what real, good religious people live by and it's a great foundation for being a good person.

I'm glad you're reasonable, I'm glad you're logical, I'm depressed that you think that logically all religious people are fundamentally wrong. Why does everything have to be based on fact? Why can I not live an existence and be happy? You should be happy that people find comfort in something. It comforts me SO much knowing that my mum isn't scared of dying because she believes she'll go to heaven, it stops her fearing the unknown and makes her life better for it! Why would you want to take that away from her. To replace it with what I go through, lying awake some nights wondering what happens to me when I die, will it all just be nothingness? What if I'm trapped in my corpse forever? One of my favourite quotes is from the Great Gatsby ""the best thing a girl can be in this world is a beautiful fool"", you may see this as ignorance to logic and natural beauty as bad and upsetting, but if someone can be truly happy in this perceived ignorant bliss, why not let them? What harm does it do to you?

I just want to stop this negative attitude to religion as a concept, I'm not arguing that there's no problems with it, I'm arguing that as a concept it is sound, it's not irrational to seek comfort in things we don't understand. Of course there's problems with religion and God and how they're run, but you cannot see every single person as a deluded fool",null,0,null,1424307735,null,0,false,0,copum08,null,t3_2wbec6,null,t1_copum08,null,t1_copts1e,null,null,null,1424667294,null,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4,null

If you are interested in how the system *really* works in parliament and why all these really good ideas never see the light of day, or why your local backbench MP seems to have no power to effect things, then watch this. 

Watch how it took one lib dem MP over 6 months to get her bill read out, only to have it filibustered by a Tory MP who thought his idea was far more important. 

The system in there can only be described as archaic at best, almost not changed for 700 years. 

It shows a heavily divided house, with MP's almost at each others throats currently, and just how much damage the Backbench Tories are really doing in there. In reality, there are 20+ MP's on the verge of going to UKIP right now. 

One thing it does show is that the General Election is going to be utter, and complete chaos, and the house is currently on the verge of collapse in every way imaginable.

No they aren't, they're good *despite* them.  To argue otherwise is to imply that they would be sociopaths or psychopaths if they hadn't discovered religion.

&gt; But also from my own critical thinking.

Why are you allowed to employ critical thinking in this argument but it's ""depressing"" when I do?

&gt; That simple rule is what real, good religious people live by and it's a great foundation for being a good person.

Wrong again.  it's the rule that good people live by, and if they happen to be religious as well, they've done well not to let their religion poison it.  There are *lots* of people in the world who are evil *because* of religion.  Are you going to deny that?

&gt; I'm depressed that you think that logically all religious people are fundamentally wrong. 

...but, logically, they *are* wrong.  Why does that depress you?

&gt; Why does everything have to be based on fact?

What else do we have?

&gt; It comforts me SO much knowing that my mum isn't scared of dying because she believes she'll go to heaven

Good!  It comforts *me* to know that when I die it will all be over, and I need never worry about anything again.  No religion necessary!

&gt; I'm arguing that as a concept it is sound

No, as a concept it isn't sound at all.  To be ""sound"" there must be some facts upon which it is based.  No religion I have ever encountered has been able to offer a single fact.  Not one.

&gt; Of course there's problems with religion and God and how they're run, but you cannot see every single person as a deluded fool

Why not?  If you believe in something for which there is no evidence, what better description can there be than deluded?

&gt; I just want to stop this negative attitude to religion as a concept

I don't.

They do seem to have a conservative/small-state stance the rest of the time, so it could be opposition to an in-house provider rather than using contractors.

They also tend to represent the 'traditional', 'serious' IT worker, so that might be part of it. A lot of trendy web technologies are basically bullshit or claim to be revolutionary despite just porting ideas that have been around forever to JavaScript. For example, lots of web developers use key-value databases for things that would have been *much* easier and more reliable with a traditional relational database. Understandably, people who have been in the business for a while get pretty annoyed by the attention-deficit, shiny-object approach to technology.

GDS definitely use some fashionable tech - Go, Rails, Node etc., but they get the job done and seem to be pretty sensible about it. Being willing to try out new technologies is also pretty important if you want to attract the best people - you're going to struggle to hire excellent programmers if you decree that everything must be built in Java or VB or whatever.

I suspect the main problem GDS face is that they have to get to grips with other departments' complex, poorly-documented processes. If the team currently responsible for overseeing the visa-granting process is told that GDS are going to come along and automate the whole thing, it's unlikely that they're going to be cooperative. 

Luckily, the people who set up GDS in the first place realised this and have made a big point of forcing all new digital services to share their code, metrics etc. I'm hopeful that this will improve the situation significantly over time - particularly as it means that big (and veery expensive) 'step-change' projects should mostly be eliminated and replaced with incremental improvement.",null,0,null,1424310739,null,0,false,0,copw9nb,null,t3_2wblkt,null,t1_copw9nb,null,t1_copj950,null,null,null,1424668138,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

I credit mourinho to modify the lineup and structure based on the opponent. So let's get past the comments on a single lineup from the article. 

Sure some players didn't practice and are exhausted, but who isn't at this stage of the season? Think sterling wouldn't take a few days off for Liverpool? 

Doubt many will agree with me, but has anyone noticed more chatter surrounding the injuries than the performance? That's my main point, look at how the criticism is not the performance of the team. It's 'tired players' and 'lack of rotation' instead. We see this all the time. Mourinho has taken a large amount of pressure from the players and shifted it away from their performances.

The other replies seem focused on whether employers or agencies  can insist *the individual* pay for ""professional or recruitment fees"" provided by the employer/agency, or any other company the employer/agency may nominate, as a condition of employment and the answer they give is correct **in that particular circumstance**.

*However* if the question is: ""Can my employer charge me reasonable costs and expenses *they have incurred in order to recruit me?""* then I am afraid that the answer is a firm **""yes""** according to the judgment in [Cleeve Link v Bryla 2013](http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKEAT/2013/0440_12_0810.html) which covered this issue and the employee *lost* the appeal.

The appeal established that such charges in an employee contract *are* possible **provided that** they are specified from the outset, as they then become a [liquidated damages clause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidated_damages).

You say you ""signed a 6 month contract stating that if I left the company or was dismissed ... within 12 months, I owe *the employer* the fees **they paid** to the agency""

When you say ""employer"" is that who you signed this contract with - the person you actually worked for? If so, then I am afraid that this could indeed be a lawful deduction as it was in the contract and you signed knowingly and willingly.

 [**Liquidated damages**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidated%20damages): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Liquidated damages__ (also referred to as liquidated and ascertained damages) are damages whose amount the parties designate during the formation of a [contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracts)  for the injured party to collect as compensation upon a specific breach (e.g., late performance). 

&gt;When damages are not predetermined/assessed in advance, then the amount recoverable is said to be 'at large' (to be agreed or determined by a court or tribunal in the event of breach).

&gt;At [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law), a liquidated damages clause will not be enforced if its purpose is to punish the wrongdoer/party in breach rather than to compensate the injured party  (in which case it is referred to as a [penal or penalty clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_damages)).  One reason for this is that the enforcement of the term would, in effect, require an equitable order of [specific performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_performance). However, courts sitting in [equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(law\)) will seek to achieve a fair result and will not enforce a term that will lead to the [unjust enrichment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unjust_enrichment) of the enforcing party. 

&gt;In order for a liquidated damages clause to be upheld, two conditions must be met.

&gt;


&gt;* First, the amount of the damages identified must roughly approximate the damages likely to fall upon the party seeking the benefit of the term. 

&gt;* Second, the damages must be sufficiently uncertain at the time the contract is made that such a clause will likely save both parties the future difficulty of estimating damages.

&gt;Damages that are sufficiently uncertain may be referred to as __unliquidated damages__, and may be so categorized because they are not mathematically calculable or are subject to a [contingency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingent_liability) which makes the amount of damages uncertain.

As far as I can make out, there are many islands in the Pacific which are barely inhabitable, and dependent upon supplies from outside.

As a tourist, remote islands without airports are expensive to get to, and their isolation is probably more of a negative than a positive. You can be plenty isolated on the Scottish isles, or in parts of Ireland without being so dangerously far from medical help. 

If you want to get away from it all somewhere hot, then you'd probably be better off heading to South American - there are probably loads of nice little towns and villages 100 miles outside of the big cities. At least that way you can drive or hitchhike into town if you need supplies or a doctor.

Most pacific islands go literally months without visitors.

You want a platform to open an account with and invest through - a broker, since buying funds (or shares) directly is effectively restricted to 'big' players rather than individuals. Main point of comparison between platforms will be what fees they charge, but possibly also how nice their interface is to work with, or how wide a selection of funds/shares they offer access to.

There's a [list of platforms here](http://monevator.com/compare-uk-cheapest-online-+brokers/) with details of their fees - the main split is between flat fees (annually, or on each trade, or on opening the account in the first place) and percentage-based fees (again, annually or per-trade).

Quite often. From the sandwiches my station sells which are packaged like they are transporting nuclear waste, to boxes and cable ties at work, there are many situations where a small knife is very useful. I'd carry a lock knife if I could but that was found to be legally classified as a fixed blade knife, despite the fact that a lock knife is safer (especially against zip ties).

&gt; What if your claim that you may have seen a gun diverts officers from a more serious, lethal crime?

That's a potential problem, but I do consider people robbing, beating with metal bars and sexually assaulting a passerby to be a very serious crime. And if they do it once and get away with it, they will do something like this again to another stranger. And that could well be fatal. The risk of taking resources away from another incident is real but it has to be weighed against the risk they get away because the police didn't deploy enough resources to this incident.

&gt; I pretty much agree with what you said, I carry a legal knife for protection and, while I wouldn't lie to the police, I absolutely understand why you might and I support that. Just playing Devil's Advocate. ;)

Carrying anything for protection is illegal in the UK, and doing that with a legal carry pocket knife will result in you being charged in the same manner as carrying a kitchen knife in a public place.

It's a small folding knife under 3"" that doesn't lock. Unlike all other knives you don't need a reason beyond ""general purpose cutting of things"" under UK law. Other people I work with carry multitools on the basis that the police aren't going to stop people in suits but if they are stopped then the ""I need it for work"" argument only carries if they are going to or from the office. I don't need to legally justify carrying my knife in most cases (so long as I'm not being a dick with it), because I'm an adult and the UK's law makes specific provisions that allow me to carry it. Same applies for you, and here are [261 knives to choose from](http://www.heinnie.com/knives-and-tools/folding-blade-knives/f/uk_friendly_carry/yes).

&gt; Fair enough on the second point, the chances of them having another lethal crime that they won't be able to cover are very low. However if you tell them that someone is violently wielding a metal bar while his friend assaults another person their response will be pretty much the same anyway.
