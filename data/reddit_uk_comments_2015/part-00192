I expect that your wedding planning is pretty well done, but here is an assortment of Doctor Who themed wedding clips from YouTube. There are DW related vows in most of them, as well as DW music, props, location staging and participant role playing. Some of the videos are better than others. Check out the publication notes and comments as well as the videos. Best wishes.

No. Just no. It is incredibly impossible to learn to command a language to the same level as a native, and very few immigrants will ever do so. 

I speak Spanish to a good level, and my cousin who lives in Tenerife  says my written Spanish is better than that of most of the people she knows. In the sense that their written standard is more 'correct' grammatically and spelling-wise, many second language speakers can be better than uneducated first language speakers. But they are not 'better'. I do not have a better command of Spanish than a Spaniard who can't tell the difference between hay and ahí. Indeed linguists have found that even people who move to a new country and learn the language aged 5, and appear as fluent as anyone, are still in some ways behind those who learned it as their mother tongue.

I like to think Hendo will get somewhere close to being a pass-master like Stevie is, and I really hope it happens, but I doubt anyone will ever blow my mind as much as Steven Gerrard when it comes to long, raking passes across the field.

Given the adjustment period for a lot of foreign players, I imagine Pelle might be even better next year. But getting Austin as a replacement for injuries and the future (Pelle will be 30) is not a bad idea as well. He probably has better goal scoring instincts, but is less of a hold-up player than Pelle. 

I think Southampton need to make sure that they replace the defensive spine if Morgan leaves. As /u/karoz pointed out here: http://i.imgur.com/OVAMRKb.png Schneiderlin is by far the best and most important player for our defense. He is world class. 

A new striker will help Southampton in the doldrums of February which killed them this year. They will be even harder this year if Southampton qualify for the Europa league.

HRA was created in order to avoid having to take cases to the ECtHR and thus the time and cost of doing so, as well as the undermining of the British courts.

I think that there is no point in having a HRA when the purpose for which it was created is being unsettled. Therefore a British Bill would remove all this unnecessary aspects of the ECtHR to make the process simple and effective, whilst placing responsibility directly onto the courts we, as UK citizens, have placed our trust in.

The next role we need to fill is a holding midfield role, but I would love to see RLC step in there especially if Ramirez leaves. 

Another role we need is a young defending talent that will eventually take Terry's role. Varane would be great but i dont know how likely since he plays a key role in RM's defense.

As some players mentioned before, the only good thing he did was just let the players do what they were doing in Mourinho's time. We celebrated like we won the UCL when went through to the finals, there was still jubilation even after players left the stadium. I know it was very emotional night for him in that match(i am not sure, i think it was the anniversary of his family members who were tragically killed by the Nazi) but, i don't think a top manager would have let his team celebrate like that before they have even played the finals. He also made a big mistake for letting Anelka take a penalty after he told him he wasn't in his right mind to take a penalty.

Lavezzi represents the latter, and with so many youngsters in our attacking half of the pitch, I feel like we could use an older head out there.

I think you're right in him being a bit of a halfway house between Lamela and Chadli, except that I think his real potential is as an option against Townsend.

In my view human rights, and their interpretation, should be universal. The best way to do that is through international human rights jurisprudence.

&gt;Their biggest doubts about the Labour Party were spending and the threat of the SNP. Just 8 per cent of this group say their biggest doubts included that Labour is ‘hostile to aspiration, success and people who want to get on’.

&gt;Labour’s competence gap appears partly explained by the perceived legacy of the last Labour government. Just 27 per cent of voters think Labour has a good track record in government.

&gt; By 42 to 22 voters thought Labour was too soft on big business, not too tough; rising to 50 to 15 among voters who considered Labour. By 46 to 35 voters thought Lab should increase taxes on the rich rather than worry about driving investors abroad.

&gt;However, despite widespread concerns about Labour’s spending plans, more people said they believed the party were too tough (39%) rather than too soft on the deficit (34%). 

So according to this poll, we need to be tougher on businesses, less tough (or the same as we are) on deficit reduction, don't need to worry about ""aspiration"" at all, but should absolutely worry about how people perceive the last New Labour government (poorly), and the SNP (scary).

Or we hope the germanium experts are charismatic enough to convince a bunch of people who know nothing about germanium to distribute the germanium sensibly? That seems risky to me - it is better to use germanium for semiconductors than antibiotics, because there are many substitutes for germanium in antibiotic development and basically none in semiconductors, but unless people take the time to read the statistical evaluations they might just vote for antibiotics because they sound more important. And what about special interests? People who know a lot about geranium probably think it is the bees knees - how do you know they won't keep most of it for research, which is what they find most interesting to do with it (and they might genuinely believe is best to do with it, even though if everyone was fully informed they would disagree)

Who gets to vote on geranium, how often do they vote, and how often do you have the geranium meeting? Bear in mind there are thousands of different products, so you can't have votes lasting a long time (probably less long than this comment).

You can google price discovery if you're interested. I don't think you're really interested though. I will keep 'banging on' about it because you haven't yet explained a mechanism which can determine the amount of geranium to use in medical applications. Since people will die if you get that apportionment wrong, I think it is pretty important you get it right. Prices are a mechanism which can determine the amount of geranium to use in medical applications (again, not the only mechanism) - they work by offering an unfakable incentive to speak up if you believe the split is incorrect. If people value a product in one application more than another you can 'arbitrage' the product across and raise/lower the price respectively, until the prices are equal and you have no incentive to arbitrage any more.",null,0,null,1432279265,null,0,false,0,crh85af,null,t3_36i3nu,null,t1_crh85af,null,t1_crgri6u,null,null,null,1433203349,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

&gt; Here are some of the rights infringements that the HRA has prevented in the UK:

    Requiring that when somebody is killed by the state there must be a proper independent investigation, and that armed personnel should be trained properly (McCann et al v UK)

    Preventing the government informing paramilitaries they know will kill someone of that individual's location, to execute by proxy (Shaghan v UK) You can't put an ethnic individual in a cell with a racist offender and take bets on how long he'll last (he died) (R on the application of Amin v SSHD)

    It led to safeguards and legal standards for wiretapping (Malone v UK) (Although it would appear not nearly enough...)

    You can't ""interrogate"" prisoners by forcing them into certain positions or depriving them of light and sound (Ireland v UK)

    The legalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland (Dudgeon v UK)

    Stopping contempt of court from infringing on freedom of the press (Sunday Times v UK)

    The mentally ill who voluntarily commit themselves to an institution are owed the same duty - suicide watch etc - as those who are sectioned (Rabone v Pennine Care)

    Ensuring that existing prisoners still get access to solicitors (Golder v UK)

    Ensuring that workers maintain rights to join trade unions (Wilson v UK)

    Giving the police an obligation to act if somebody is being dangerously stalked (Osman v UK)

    Preventing indefinite detention under the declaration of a national emergency (A v SOS for the Home Dept).

    Preventing public birching of children by the police in the Isle of Man (Tyrer v UK)

    If you're arrested and acquitted, the government cannot arbitrarily hold onto your DNA, which could never have been obtained were you not wrongly accused (S &amp; Marper vs UK)

In every single instance here the British government claimed it was doing nothing wrong and defended its actions. But please, go on about how superior we apparently are.

I feel the same way.  A petition feels about as effective as a Facebook like.  Just out of interest I did some Googling to see what petitions have changed.

[According to this article from the campaigns director at Change.org](http://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2013/apr/12/small-online-petition-change):
&gt;  One of the best is Lucy Holmes who has been using Change.org (as well as Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr, TV and newspapers) to ask the editor of the Sun newspaper to drop page three.

&gt; ...

&gt; Then there's Jayne Linney – ATOS wouldn't record her disability assessment after continually getting her details wrong, despite ministerial statements that they would do. She started a Change.org petition and got a relatively modest 1,500 signatures but by combining this with traditional tactics like writing to MPs and calling local journalists she won her campaign too.

&gt; ...

&gt; Yesterday I got an email from a man who wanted to protect buskers in Liverpool from being banned by the council. He'd started a change.org petition and it had won last year. He's now working with other organisations, campaigning to protect arts in our open spaces and been given a place on the council's advisory board. ""My change.org petition changed my life"" he wrote. Not bad for one of those pointless online petitions, eh?

Those were the only examples given from 2013.  Here some recent ones from the [change.org victories page](https://www.change.org/en-GB/victories):

[Bring back Hartlepool's Sea Coalers!!!!](https://www.change.org/p/hartlepool-borough-council-garry-jones-bring-back-hartlepool-s-sea-coalers)

[Retain diving facilities at Park Road Leisure Centre in Crouch End](https://www.change.org/p/haringey-council-and-fusion-lifestyle-retain-diving-facilities-at-park-road-leisure-centre)

There's lots more for individual petitions like: 

[Bring my sister home from Iranian prison](https://www.change.org/p/david-cameron-hassanrouhani-bring-my-sister-home-freeghonchehghavami)

[Family granted UK visas to attend five-year-old's funeral](https://www.change.org/p/david-cameron-grant-visas-for-andrea-gada-s-family-to-attend-her-funeral-andreagada)

[Withdraw the police caution given to my 19-year-old with Downs Syndrome.](https://www.change.org/p/victor-olisa-withdraw-the-police-caution-given-to-my-19-year-old-with-downs-syndrome)

So, they do work.  But for small things or individual cases.  I don't know of any big ones that changed anything.  [Here another good article I found asking if they work](http://2020plus.net/Editorial-358-Mal-Fletcher-Do-Online-Protests-Work-Reflecting-on-Jeremy-Clarkson-Saga.aspx):

&gt; Some people will feel that having signed a petition they’ve made a bigger contribution to a cause than they actually have.

&gt;In reality, petitions are a form of activism-light. If you’re really serious about supporting a particular change, you’ll probably feel you want to get involved in some more rubber-hits-the-road way, perhaps by joining or regularly supporting a campaign group.

&gt;As the Top Gear protest reflects, petitions may be useful but even the most well supported are not guaranteed of success. This may be in part because there are just so many petitions going around.

&gt; Or it might just be that Jeremy Clarkson was right: once whales, the ruling elites of the seas, make up their minds to feast, they pay scant attention to noisy protests from plankton.

[Here's one about direct.gov petitions:](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/24/e-petitions-often-worse-than-useless)

&gt; Directgov not only creates false expectations, it actually puts a stopper in campaigns. It may have replaced faked signatures with the convenience and reliability of a digital age, but for a campaigner this comes at a high price. When thousands of people put their name to a cause on Directgov, this data becomes the sole property of the government – whose very actions they are challenging. Even in the rare case of success, the person who started the petition has no way to inform those who signed it, never mind mobilise this mass base of supporters to take a campaign forward.

&gt; ...

&gt; A petition is often the start of a long fight for change. In the case of the national forests, half a million of us signed up. 38 Degrees then brought together these people to fund a YouGov study, speak to their MPs, put advertisements in national newspapers and apply pressure on an independent panel. This particular journey was 27 months long, and led to victory when the government was forced to revoke the policy.

&gt; So the long tradition of petitioning government has not yet been lost. But if you are ever provoked enough to start your own petition, please don't put its future in the hands of those it holds to account.

[Here's a list of the outcomes of direct.gov petitions that reached 100,000](http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/backbench-business/Outcomes-of-e-petitions.pdf) (PDF).  Those were ones that were debated in parliament, but I can't find the full outcome of them (did they change anything?).  [This is the view of Rt Hon Mr Elfyn Llwyd MP of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee in 2013](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmpolcon/82/82vw30.htm):

&gt; The jury is still out, however, on the effectiveness of the e-petitions regime which has come about as a result of this recommendation. There is significant confusion about the arbitrary number of signatures needed to initiate a debate (purportedly 100,000, though petitions can be presented to the Backbench Business Committee with far fewer signatures, or no signatures at all, in order to be considered eligible as the basis for a debate).

&gt; Perhaps the new system has not had the effect desired by the committee since only fifteen debates have so far been pursued under the new system.

[This is from an e-petition report from Feburary this year](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06450#fullreport) [(PDF)](http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06450/SN06450.pdf):

&gt; The Government reported that by the beginning of December 2013, 19 out of 23 such petitions
had been debated (by the end of March 2014, these figures had reached 22 out of 2767), and
that some had “had a direct impact on Government policy”.

[This is direct.gov's epetition site today](http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/) - You can't even look at older petitions, so it's hard to go any further:
&gt; e-petitions is taking a break from 30 March 2015 until soon after the General Election

&gt; The current Parliament closed on 30 March 2015 to prepare for the General Election in May 2015. It’s not possible to accept any new petitions or signatures, or to provide a Government response to an existing petition now that Parliament has been dissolved.

&gt; e-petitions will be back soon after the General Election.

Regardless of their effectiveness, you can't even petition the Government directly right now.  Hard to see if any of the debated ones have had any real effect with the website shut (someone else feel free to wayback machine it).

Not asking to be argumentative or anything, but I genuinely think playing for England has only hindered a lot if youngsters. Ross Barkley has gone backwards as a footballer since playing for them. There is an extra arrogance with him now, holds on to the ball for an extra few touches, constantly running into blind alleys. Sterling... Well I can't be arsed writing about him because it would turn into an essay.


Because of the pressure the media puts on the young players, playing for England is now something a player has to overcome rather than making him better.


All I want is for Jack to become the best player he can be and I don't think playing international footballer helps either way. International football in general is nowhere near the quality people make it out to be, it's nowhere near Champions league.

The earthquakes in Nepal are caused by two plates cramming against each other (and forming the Himalayas in the process). California quakes are caused by two plates moves across each other.

Probably not.  In general a company is not obligated to provide you with a reference. Exceptions include if there is anything specific in your contract or if you work in certain regulated industries like finance where employers may be required to provide certain information.

If none of those apply then I'm afraid you can't force them to do anything.  

That said it's always worth taking the nice approach first off.  By the sound of things you have a decent relationship with your manager so in the first instance I'd simply ask if there was a problem.  It may be as simple as the request having gone astray or been forgotten.

OK, so 1) this was something originally created by the Tory-LD government and didn't exist before and 2) the roles it held will still be carried out but by other committees (which I guess might be cheaper?).

I don't particularly want to go into next season with the same starting XI as we have now... in fact I'd make as many as 4-5 changes (CB, possibly RB depending on how Walker recovers, CM, LW and possibly even RW).  So if we do anything like that, then it makes a fair bit of this season redundant then.

Hard to sack a man who has been in your corner longer than, say, Brendan Rodgers or Jamie Carragher. Hard to sack a man who sacrificed his own career and gambled with his own family based on his belief in you to be a star and earn millions.

I'd wager that Raheem Sterling knows little beyond the world of football. So, at 20, he's hardly a grown man.

null,false,Creased_Carpet,null,null,null,"There would have been a liquidity crises even if banks could recover all of the money from the houses. The recovery rate has nothing to do with a liquidity crises. A liquidity crises happens when banks can't sell assets to generate liquid cash fast enough to service their immediate liabilities. It takes months to go to the courts and repossess a house and sell it. This short term delay means that banks can't service payments in the short term which is what a liquidity crises is.

However this wasn't the main cause of the liquidity crises. The main cause was that banks used short term ( even overnight) borrowing to maintain liquidity but lent over the ling term. When creditors realised their default rates were going to be higher than expected they stopped lending to these short term markets to maintain liquidity. This caused a liquidity panic as everyone else became short on it and so also stopped lending and everyone stopped lending to each other. Now banks have liquidity buffers as well as equity buffers so there is less risk of this happening.

Also there was oversupply in housing in the USA which together with foreclosures and the lack of new mortgage lending caused prices to crash in some areas. The level of real (non-bubble) demand in the south east makes the situation very different. All the points I've made together mean that house prices in the UK have far better support and so a crash due to instability caused by bubbles etc is not going to happen if house prices go down by say 10% next year.",null,0,null,1432283541,null,0,1432284119,0,crh9a5q,null,t3_36qhad,null,t1_crh9a5q,null,t1_crgsl9c,null,null,null,1433203884,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

bilic is not a good coach. not even close. for 2 years, he fucks all the chances he had. this year, bjk could be the champions, but he lost 7 points in 3 games -very easy games- cos lack of tactical knowlegde. and now they're gonna 3rd. think about all the money lost for not joining cl. and now think about that the money goes to your rivals.

team doesn't even play good. you probably saw only the european games -much probably only arsenal, tottenham and liverpool games. arsenal and tottenham games were good, liverpool is just an extra. you saw the goal. without it, there're no beşiktaş. at brugge games, proudhomme make some awesome changes and won 2 games. now, he is a good coach. bilic just watched.

if there's no pressure, he can manage to do something. but if there's a little pressure, he losts it.

he sticks with the 4th ref, always complains about something, never watches games, does stupid player choices etc. etc. 
he probably doesn't know how to train them -there're romours that he stills does condition overrides, which causes the team fall apart at 50th minute mark.

his team can't hold the score. idk how much points lost with that way -his team always concedes after 70-75. he plays down after 1-0 and loses with that way too.

he is not a winner, he is much like an amigo at the bench. he also is very obsessive with some players -whether if they play good or bad. they always start, they never comes to the bench. it drives you crazy.

beşiktaş fans -some of them- loves him but admits that he has to change, progress. let me tell you, since he joined beşiktaş, he didn't make any progress. not even 1 drop of it. they think he should be more open minded about his players. more fair with giving the shirts. but i don't think he'll change.

long story short, he (maybe) can do something with mid table teams if there's no pressure on him. but i don't think he'll be successfull with a big team. he can't handle that pressure.

No you're not. You come from the global south, you're not ""white"". Everyone has their local cultures and traditions. You think the Mughal Empires and the Persian Empire were lacking in culture? Do you really think that poets like Iqbal and Ghalib were unaware of Rumi and Sham Tabrizi or Ghazali? This is the exceptionalism that gets up South Asian's noses. You think you're separate from a culture that started from the med and ended on the borders of China and included India. I mean Urdu is a turkish word, most of the empires in the region had either Turkik warriors fighting for them or Turkik Princes running them. If anything Tukiki culture adapted local custom into itself - all the way from the Buyids, the Seljuks, the Khwarzimis, the Mughals  to the Mameluks.

&gt;The guy saved Muslims from the ""infidels"" and they hate him because he shut down a monarchy. If he didn't touch the Caliphate and it remained as a ceremonial role, they would adore him no doubt as a great ""Jihadist"". 

Well, yes and no. He also destroyed the Sufi orders which were the natural brake on the Jihadists. If he'd left the Sufis alone the Wahabis wouldn't have the space to colonise because they didn't have the tradition. South Asain Islam was/is Sufi, it was built around Chistiya and Naqshbaniya orders both based in Turkey. Once the link was broken it had  no intellectual and moral force behind it - and the wahabis waltzed in.

&gt; 
&gt; A new contract wasn't such a priority for me, but getting fit was. That said now it's signed I couldn't be happier.

&gt; Commitment works both ways and it’s been great to know that Southampton has given me pretty much unconditional support during this very difficult period.
&gt; 
&gt; Whilst all the rumours and speculation surrounding my future has been flattering it has never changed my resolve and my priority which has been to get fit and get ready for a return to the Number 9 shirt at Saints, playing in the Premiership and to begin to make my way back into the England set-up.
&gt; 
&gt; I’ve kept my own counsel as have my management team who have now taken on the brilliant guise of ‘Team Rodriguez’ and I'll now let my football do the talking and with luck that might happen sooner than later.
&gt; 
&gt; The support of Southampton FC and the physio team in particular has been second-to-none, and I thank them for everything in the past year or so.

Policy affects behavior. Simple fact. If your argument isn't accounting for behavioral changes it's a half argument. The fact those changes aren't easy to quantify doesn't mean either (a) that you can ignore them in your argument or (b) that my argument is 'pseudo'.

FOr a more detailed set of issues, we used a builder who came round with us and pointed out everything that was wrong with the place and how much it would cost to fix which is a step over a survey which doesn't tell you what it costs to fix.

I went round with the builder on the day and pointed out as much as I could see in addition to what he could see and we got an almighty ""quote"" back from him broken down into various workpackages.  Some of which were actually things that didn't need doing but that we wanted to do.  As it's not the sort of thing he normally did, we agreed £75 for it which covered the hour he was on site and however long it took him to write up the quote.

I guess it depends on what you want out of it.  If it's a bank mandated thing then let them choose, if you want something more then I'd use a builder.

He's doing the opposite of that now though isn't he?

So he is motivated by money? I mean come on, at £35,000 a week he's got no issue supporting his small family or buying his mum a house.

If Sterling is that mentally weak that he trusts his agent like a father, then I'm really not sure I want him at the club.

&gt;So it's a shame that the people who are allegedly closest to him (his agent) have taken a massive risk, overplayed their hand and now risk ruining everything for Sterling.

It is a shame, but Sterling would have to be thick as fuck not to see this.

(Warning: speculation.) Rents tend to be sticky. Once a tenant has moved in, then the rent tends to rise very slowly, if at all. That tends to push advertised ""asking rents"" up above the average, as landlords attempt to lock in a rent rise that will cover them for the whole of the next tenancy.

So I guess that if you bounce around a lot between private lets, never staying in one place for very long, then you will pay well above the average. I imagine that the new rental market is more volatile too.

This is because we have been manually approving your submissions, and we have had to do this because you have been **shadowbanned**. I wouldn't normally say anything about this because there is often no way to know the reason behind it, but in this case I think I have a pretty good idea.

I believe you have fallen afoul of the reddit 9:1 content ratio recommendation. If you don't know what that is, basically it means that reddit wants you to make 9 comments or posts that aren't your own content for every 1 that is, and if you are regularly posting links from the same site reddit marks you as a spammer. The bans are generally done by an automated system and have nothing to do with individual subreddits, so any appeal would have to be made to the site admins.

Your content is received positively here, so we will continue to manually approve your posts, but I would recommend contacting one of the administrators if you wish to reverse this ban.

That's not an annual figure.  That's inflation over the eight years from 2005 to 2013, not for a single year. That timescale matches the ONS rental inflation figures, to allow direct comparison.

You've prompted me to go and look up the actual CPI figures. I originally got that +30% figure from an online inflation calculator, and it looks like it *was* inaccurate. The true figure is +21%. That doesn't affect my argument of course, since rent inflation was still well below that. (I'll go and correct my previous comments though.)

[Here's the CPI data:](http://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Consumer_Price_Index/HistoricalCPI.aspx?reloaded=true) In January 2013 the CPI was 230.280, in January 2005 it was 190.700. That's a +20.8% rise over those 8 years.

Of course he has a say in who comes in, but he tells the scouting teams _what_ it is he needs, rather than _who_. 

It's this which leads to one of the biggest frustrations about the Silly Season in general: a lot of people look at players they like, rather than what they think the squad needs to improve it. They're then surprised when we buy a player they hadn't thought of.

He does wait though. He asks for a player with certain attributes, Emenalo and his team go and do their job, Jose as manager and head coach gets the final say if he's a fit, the board do their bit if they approve the purchase. 

The speculation around Cech at the moment is an example. It's not Jose's choice if he stays or goes. Cech himself has alluded to this, too. Jose says he doesn't want him to leave, but it's Roman who has the final say.

There's no process of a window as such from the player search point of view. That goes on all year round. The transfer windows are a ridiculous outmoded and outdated idea that are a frustration for clubs and a wankfest for some fans. They're there just for the exchange of contracts.

The situation of 'owning money' then becomes simply a job.  Spend when you're told, save when you're told.  That completely changes the relationship between money and man.  

Of course it would work, having one central agency controlling the money makes it much easier to keep control - like having one person driving a car as suppose to 4 people driving a car.  Of course it's going to go smoothly.  The question is, will it still do what we require it to do?  Will it still be doing the job we invented it for in the first place?  My answer would be no, it isn't - but I'm not entirely sure that would be a terrible thing.  

My immediate concern would be that it would make buying anything illegal impossible - but then of course as that would be so obviously true a work-around would be set up in no time.  'Crime, uh, finds a way'.

This is a really interesting idea.  It is basically an example of what I would previously have thought of as an example of dystopian and authoritarian micro-management of individuals.  But on second glance - it could actually be brilliant.  If it would completely change the relationship of man and money, it might even be a plausible direction for us to improve the human situation.  Spend when we need to, save when we need to.  It removes the responsibility from individuals which has, quite frankly, become a mind-bendingly oppressive responsibility for a hell of a lot of people.  People spend their entire lives trying to manage their accounts.  It's not right and it's not fair.  If the system could be made to work in a somewhat automated fashion (seeing as there seems to be the common belief that it needs to exist at all) then this is one way of fixing that.

For me, it's the way other clubs' supporters focus on our delusion about the ""West Ham way"". 

I've been going to West Ham for about 15 years and can could count on one hand the number of times fans have talked about how we're no longer playing the ""West Ham way"". Maybe in the 80s, but it's bollocks now. Other fans clinging onto shit like this as a way to ridicule us is probably the most annoying thing. They don't know the first thing about the situation. I'd love to say it's just the few on /r/soccer but the amount of people that have said to me in person we're stupid about getting rid of Sam..! 

A month or so back, Alan Shearer (twat) said, on Match of the Day, he'd talked to a West Ham fan about the situation to get a view from our perspective. I thought ""great perhaps he can redeem himself a little here by actually contributing something insightful""... But then he spouts on about the""West Ham way"" and doesn't address the issues that **every other fan sees**. Either he talked to an stupid fan or he just made it up entirely. Probably the latter.

It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable.

There's a [proposal to change the way it currently works](http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/procedure-committee/news/e-petitions-chairs-comments/) ([PDF](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmproced/235/235.pdf)) from the House of Commons
Procedure Committee in Dec 2014 - 50 pages if anyone's interested.

&gt; This report presents our proposals for the collaborative e-petition system which the House
requested. The system we recommend will be based on the existing Government e-petition
site, redesigned and rebranded to show that it is jointly owned by the House and the
Government. The terms and conditions of the site will be broadly the same as those of the
existing Government site, revised only insofar as is necessary to reflect the fact that
petitions submitted through the site will be presented to the House. Petitioners will be
required to include a clear statement of the action which they want the Government, or the
House, to take as a result of their petition. A petition will need to attract the support of at
least six people before it is opened for signature on the site. Petitions will stay open for
signature for six months, after which they will be presented formally to the House.

&gt; Oversight of the joint e-petition system will be undertaken on behalf of the House by a
Petitions Committee, chaired by a member elected by the whole House. The Committee
will also assume responsibility for oversight of the paper petitioning system. The
Committee will be able to consider petitions submitted by either means, and as
appropriate, and at its discretion:

&gt; * correspond with petitioners on their petition;
* call petitioners for oral evidence;
* refer a petition to the relevant select committee;
* seek further information from the Government, orally or in writing, on the subject of a petition; and
* put forward petitions for debate.

&gt; The Petitions Committee will be supported by a staff team with responsibility for
moderating e-petitions, advising and supporting the Committee in its examination of
petitions submitted, advising and assisting petitioners and providing information to
petitioners on Parliamentary developments and activity relating to their petition.

&gt; Together with the rebranding and redesigning of the e-petition website, the establishment
of a Petitions Committee with its own team of staff has the potential to produce a
significant improvement in the information which is available to petitioners about what the
House of Commons does and the many ways in which Members of Parliament use the
opportunities the House offers them to respond to the public’s concerns. The proposals we
set out in this report should bring about a significant enhancement of the relationship
between the petitioning public and their elected representatives, and we commend them to
the House.

I gave it a scan, here are some interesting bits.  Their emphasis:

&gt; \16. The existing Government e-petition system works, and has proved popular with the
public. It is also reasonably economical to run, and though some development work will be
needed to establish it as a jointly-owned system, using the existing site as a basis will avoid
the need to spend money on designing a whole new system. **A joint system should be
based on the existing Government e-petition site, redesigned and rebranded to show
that it is owned by the House and the Government. To emphasise the Parliamentary
oversight of the system, and in line with the House’s historic role as the principal
recipient of public petitions, it should use the URL epetitions.parliament.uk. There
should also be a clear link from the Parliament website www.parliament.uk to the epetition
site, including from the pages which explain the existing paper petitioning
system.**

&gt; ...

&gt; \25. The Petitions Committee will decide for itself which petitions merit further action, and
what action is appropriate in each case. It may decide to use thresholds for signatures to
trigger certain action, such as putting forward a petition for debate, at its discretion. We
expect the Petitions Committee to take the well-established and reasonably well understood
existing threshold of 100,000 signatures for a petition to be considered for
debate in the House as a starting-point; but there may be occasions when a debate is not
appropriate—such as when a debate has already taken place in the House on the subject—
and the Petitions Committee may decide that a petition which has not reached that 100,000
threshold is nonetheless worthy of a debate in the House. The Committee might also
decide to use signature thresholds as an indicator of whether other potential action—such
as corresponding with or taking oral evidence from the petitioners—would be appropriate
in a particular case; but again it need not bind itself to do so. The advantage of the
establishment of a committee is that it will be able to exercise its judgement on whether a
petition is worthy of further action, based not only on the number of people who have
signed it but on the content of the petition itself.  As the then Clerk of the House told us,

&gt; &gt; I think it is easy to get fazed by the 100,000, the 10,000, the 25,000 or whatever. If you
have a threshold for further action—whether it is a debate or Government
observations—of 100,000, it becomes a numbers game, not forgetting, of course, that
it is much easier to rack up numbers for an e-petition than it is for people signing
sheets of paper. Sheer numbers, I think, have their place, but if e-petitions are to be
catered for, I think the other end of the scale needs to be catered for as well. If you
have 200,000 people signing an e-petition condemning the annexation of Crimea, for
example, in a sense that is a no-brainer—it may be quite an easy target to hit—but if
you have Mrs Smith, one individual, who is having her life made a misery by some
bizarre interpretation of a rule by officialdom, I see her as very much having equal
rights in this.

&gt; ...

&gt; \32. The Petitions Committee should be supported by a staff team with responsibility for:

&gt; * moderating e-petitions, assisted as necessary by Government officials;
&gt; * advising and supporting the Committee in its examination of petitions submitted;
&gt; * advising petitioners on how to petition and assisting them with the process;
&gt; *  keeping petitioners and signatories who have opted in to receiving further
information informed of the progress of their petition, and (subject to the volume
of petitions received and the resources available) informing them of other
Parliamentary developments or activity touching the subject of their petition, and
making such information available on the e-petitions website.

&gt; ...

&gt; \43. We also consider that the e-petition site should offer creators and signatories of epetitions
a means of notifying their Member of Parliament that they had signed a petition.
There are a number of ways in which that might be done. For example, a link could be
provided on the site once a visitor had signed a petition saying Contact your MP to let
them know you have signed this petition, which would automatically open an email to the
petitioner’s constituency MP, based on the postcode they have entered as part of the
signing process. Or a system could be established whereby petition signatories would be
able to opt in to their email address being made available to their constituency MP, with
lists of those who had done so, broken down by petition signed, being provided to MPs
who request them on, say, a weekly basis. If the House approves the system we propose in
this report, we will pursue the provision of these options in the redesigned e-petition site.

&gt; ...

&gt; \45. **We recommend that moderation of the jointly-owned system—that is, examination
of e-petitions submitted to ensure that they comply with the terms and conditions of
the site—should be carried out by Petitions Committee staff, advised as necessary by
officials of Government departments.** This will represent a significant transfer of
responsibility—and therefore cost—from the Government to the House; but we consider it
necessary to ensure that the House retains control of the petitions which are presented to it,
not least because of the considerations of Parliamentary privilege which we discuss below.
It is also appropriate that moderation of petitions should be carried out by the same team
which is responsible for advising and supporting petitioners in the way we discuss above.

&gt; ...

&gt; \50. We recommend only one significant change to the existing terms and conditions which
is not a straightforward consequence of the transition to a jointly-owned system. That is
that **petitioners should be required to include a clear statement of the action which they
want the Government, or the House, to take as a result of their petition**. This change
was recommended to us by those running the existing system and appears to be an obvious
way of focussing a petition and ensuring that the Government and/or the House respond

Yes, the ONS' index is experimental, but I think we can use it to answer crude questions such as ""were rents going up or down in real terms?"" Sadly I think they've stopped publishing it, which it why there's no data since 2013. It's not changed much since then though. The [latest figures from the ONS](http://ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/april-2015/article-briefing-note.html#tab-CPI-detailed-briefing-) have rental inflation in the year to April, 2015 at +0.8%.

The Conservative government is likely to start turning the ""total benefit cap"" screw, which is going to have a real negative impact on the bottom, housing benefit end of the market. I imagine that might help to drag the rest of the market lower too.

Two things, first TUSC isn't part of this dispute so how would they know? and second unions are not above using overdramatic rhetoric during a strike. If this was really the case RMT would definately make it known (something along the lines of train companies are putting yout lives at risk by getting rid of ticket inspectors). 

&gt;If a train hits something the driver might be killed

An argument for driverless trains surely?

&gt;Without the driver, who will get out and sort the signals out to prevent further crashes and make sure everybody is safe? 

Signalmen? Its one of the main part of their jobs. But bear in mind I said in some circumstances driverless trains would be better, for example the tube. 

&gt;Also, if there's a group of rowdy individuals on the train the driver is not really able to do anything due to driving the train.

This isn't a valid reason either, mainly becuase the BTP exist for this reason and other public transport services (the tube?) manage just fine without ticket inspectors to deal with rowdy passengers (and I doubt a ticket inspector would do much anyway).

A future Tory Government would scrap the Human Rights Act and replace it with a new Bill of Rights to give Britain more control over the laws that it implements, David Cameron said today.

Tories have long been opposed to the Human Rights Acts which came into force in 2000 and effectively codifies the protections in the European Convention on Human Rights of which Britain is a signatory.

Many in his party have called for a Tory Government to pull out of the ECHR altogether but Mr Cameron has not gone that far. Instead he said a Tory only Government would introduce a new British Bill of Rights.

However as long as Britain remains a signatory to the ECHR it would still be open to members of the public or group to directly petition the European Court of Human Rights in Strasburg to hear their case.

In fact Tony Blair introduced the Human Rights Acts in an effort to give UK court a greater role in deciding such cases without the need to recourse to Strasburg.

Mr Cameron said as long ago as 2006 that he wanted to ""entrench"" a British bill of rights, which would outline ""core values"" and responsibilities, in British law - so it could not be overturned in the Commons.

He said a ""clear and codified"" bill would allow the European Court of Human Rights to apply a “margin of appreciation” in its rulings - where judges are obliged to take into account the cultural, historic and philosophical differences between Strasbourg and the nation in question.

In his speech the Prime Minister cited the issue of prisoner voting to make the case for reform, and criticised the European Court of Human rights for a series of decisions that “are frankly wrong”.

“Rulings to stop us deporting suspected terrorists. The suggestion that you've got to apply the human rights convention even on the battlefields of Helmand.

“And now - they want to give prisoners the vote. No, I'm sorry, I just don't agree.

“Our Parliament - the British Parliament - decided they shouldn't have that right.

“This is the country that wrote Magna Carta, the country that time and again has stood up for human rights, whether liberating Europe from fascism or leading the charge today against sexual violence in war.

“Let me put it very clearly: We do not require instruction from judges in Strasbourg on this issue.

“So at long last, with a Conservative government after the next election, this country will have a new British Bill of Rights to be passed in our Parliament, rooted in our values.”

That index is obviously tracking *new* rentals, rather than the whole rental market. I have two comments:

1\. It does look like you are right that landlords are taking the opportunity to recoup lost ground. You might be able to predict future rents by looking at how affordability has changed in the past.

2\. This index is not necessarily comparing like with like. All they are doing is looking at the rents &amp; incomes of cases sent to them for reference. As house prices shoot up, home ownership is going beyond the reach of more and more of the working population. That means that tenants as a group will be drawn from increasingly wealthy portions of the population. So there might be a disproportional increase in the number of ""luxury"" properties that are being let.

That would cause this index to shoot up, but not necessarily mean that the rent on a particular flat is rising very quickly.

How would *you* reconcile the difference between the ONS' figure of +0.8% inflation with Homelet's +10%?

&gt; ...

&gt; \52. Our assessment of how Parliamentary privilege would apply to the system we propose
is as follows. This is a summary of how the system would work:

&gt; * A petitioner submits a petition to the site.
&gt; * The petitioner provides at least four additional e-mail addresses of people who
support the petition.
&gt; * At least five of those people confirm that they support the petition.
&gt; * The petition is forwarded to Petitions Committee staff for moderation.
&gt; * Petitions Committee staff will consider the petition and assess whether it meets the
terms and conditions set out on the site.
&gt; * If the petition meets the terms and conditions, it will be opened for signature, and
will remain open for a period of six months.
&gt; * If the petition does not meet the terms and conditions, an e-mail will be sent to the
petition creator informing them of the fact.
&gt; * Petitions which meet the terms and conditions will be considered by the Petitions
Committee.
&gt; * Following closure of the petition for signature, the petition will be presented
formally to the House.


&gt; \53. A petition should not be privileged simply by virtue of having been approved by
Petitions Committee staff. An analogy may be drawn with the role of the Clerk of Public
Petitions in respect of the existing paper petition system. She may approve the wording of a
proposed petition to the House, which is then prepared and circulated by the petitioner to
collect signatures before being presented to the House. There is no implication that the
petition is privileged whilst it is being circulated for signatures to be collected.

&gt; \54. Neither should the fact that the House is publishing the petition, and providing the
means by which signatures may be collected, mean that an e-petition would be privileged
at this stage. The House publishes much material on its website (and indeed elsewhere)
which is not a proceeding in Parliament and which is not therefore privileged.

&gt; \55. The point at which an e-petition became a proceeding in Parliament would be the point
at which it is considered by the Petitions Committee itself. The Petitions Committee
should be given the explicit task, in its Standing Order, of considering whether an epetition
is fit for presentation to the House. Presentation to the House would not take place until later in the process, at the end of the six-month signature period on the e-petition
site.53 Once the Petitions Committee had considered the petition and determined that it
considered it fit for presentation to the House, it should constitute a proceeding in
Parliament.

&gt; ...

&gt; \61. When an e-petition reaches the end of its time open for signature on the site, we
consider that it would be appropriate for it to be presented to the House, and entered on
the formal record of its proceedings. For this to occur it will not be necessary for an epetition
to be presented on the floor of the House in the same way as a public petition
brought through the paper petitioning system; nor for the full text of the petition to be
republished, since arrangements will be made for an archive to be kept of the electronic
version of all published e-petitions. Instead, we recommend that, once it is closed for
signature, the title of each e-petition be recorded in a list in the Votes and Proceedings
(or elsewhere in the formal record of House proceedings), together with the number of
signatures it has attracted.

&gt; \62. Should a Member wish to pursue it, the paper petition system will enable the formal
presentation of the subject of an e-petition on the floor of the House. Although, as we note
above, an e-petition may not meet the rules for paper petitions, in practice—as our
predecessor committee noted in a report on public petitions in 2004—the same goes for
many public petitions received by Members.59 It is usually a relatively straightforward task
for the petition to be redrafted so that it conforms to the rules for paper petitions. Whilst
this petition is not the one which has attracted signatures on the e-petition site, it is unlikely that the chair would object to a Member drawing attention, when presenting such
a petition, to the number of signatures attracted by an e-petition in similar terms. In
practice this is what happens in the case of a substantial proportion of the paper petitions
presented to the House.

&gt; ...

&gt; \64. **We recommend that the Petitions Committee should assume responsibility from
BBCom for determining debates on petitions in Westminster Hall.** The Chair of
BBCom has explained to us how that responsibility never really sat well with her
committee:60 the Petitions Committee, on the other hand, should consider it central to its
responsibility to decide whether a petition—whether an e-petition or a petition presented
through the traditional paper route—should be debated by the House. The Petitions
Committee should not, however, be able to cut across the existing responsibility of the
Backbench Business Committee to decide that a petition should be debated other than in
the dedicated slot for petition debates in Westminster Hall. **If the Petitions Committee
decides that a petition deserves a debate on the floor of the House, it would take that
request to the Backbench Business Committee, which could (but would not be obliged
to) allocate backbench time for it.** If BBCom were unable to prioritise a debate on the
petition over the matters brought before it by other Members, it would be for the Petitions
Committee to decide whether to have the matter debated in Westminster Hall, or whether
to return to BBCom with a renewed request at a time which it judged more propitious.

&gt; ...

&gt; 4 Costs

&gt; \71. The costs of the system can be broadly divided between the costs of setting up and
running the technical infrastructure, on the one hand, and of providing the staff to support
the Petitions Committee, moderate e-petitions, and support petitioners, on the other.

&gt; Technical infrastructure

&gt; \72. The cost of the technical infrastructure can be further divided between the initial
development costs to establish the new system, and the ongoing running costs. The best
estimate we have seen so far of the one-off cost of establishing the new system—that is,
redesigning and rebranding the existing Government e-petition system so that it reflects
the fact that it is now jointly owned by the House and Government, and making the
changes and improvements to the site necessary to implement the system which we have
recommended above—is £188,000. The estimate of the ongoing annual cost of running the
system is £115,000.

&gt; \73. These costs would be shared between the House and the Government. Discussions
about the most appropriate split are ongoing, but our view is that a 50:50 division of these
costs would be an appropriate starting-point.

&gt; \74. There could also be an additional cost of up to £39k to enable data from the site to be
made available through data.parliament.uk. This cost would be borne by the House but the
Finance and Services Committee would have to make a decision on whether it was
appropriate to do so.

&gt; Staff

&gt; \75. As will be apparent from the explanation we have given above of the role we envisage
for Petitions Committee staff, the size—and cost—of staffing the system we envisage is
potentially unlimited. The extent of engagement with petitioners and prospective
petitioners will depend on the resources available to the Committee: the more staff it has,
the better it will be able to serve the public and respond to the petitions which are
submitted. The extent of what the Committee’s staff can achieve will also be affected by the
number of petitions which are received and the burden of moderating them, which is
uncertain. For the purposes of this report, we think it sensible to focus on the minimum
which we judge would be necessary from the outset to support the system we have
proposed.

&gt; \76. We think that the minimum staffing which would be necessary to support the Petitions
Committee and the e-petition system which we recommend is a team of four full-time
equivalent people. A team of that size at appropriate levels of seniority would cost around
£200,000 a year. That cost, since these will be House staff, would be borne entirely by the
House.",null,0,null,1432291642,null,0,1432292189,0,crhb7ii,null,t3_36slh6,null,t1_crhb7ii,null,t1_crhappd,null,null,null,1433204792,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Why?  Chasing the student and potential student vote is useful for Labour, and I imagine the hope was it'd help them mop up Lib Dem student vote.  Given the _fury_ at Nick Clegg for U-turning on tuition fees, backing the current set would be suicide for Labour in this demographic.

It also makes sense to drop the fees down to a level where more people will actually repay their loans—currently the fees are so high and the repayment terms set out as such that it's very, very likely for students to drop out of payments having left the government with a loss on their loan.

And, for people in love with the word ‘aspiration’, what's _less_ aspirational than having to accrue a huge amount of mortgage-sized debt in order to get a bit of paper, necessary for nearly all the ‘aspirational’ jobs, that you'll spend the next two decades paying off?

If the brand is 'worth' £XXXm it must be because it is generating that much money for the company. I know there's a bit of a fad at the moment for valuing internet-based services for billions of dollars when their revenue isn't even in the hundreds of millions, but presumably a court will get them to prove that their brand is 'worth' however many millions they claim it is.

The money can either be coming from taking market share away from other brands, or by getting new people to start smoking. 

If it is the former, then the industry can work out a system of compensation internally if it really wants - gains for one brand are *exactly* offset by losses for another, so if the tobacco industry's heart just grew three sizes and it is concerned about fairness, it can sort out the problem with no government intervention.

If it is the latter, then surely someone should point out that tobacco industry execs were lying under oath to a select committee when they said they believed branding was not responsible for new people taking up smoking (in the face of a very large amount of evidence saying the opposite). The government can hardly be held liable for failing the tobacco industry when it was literally taking advice from that very same industry saying that this wouldn't happen

Either way, if I were the British government I'd say, ""Don't care what happens in this court case; we're not going to bother defending ourselves and if you win we're just going to put up the duty on tobacco until you've paid back all the money you owe us, plus a little bit extra for wasting our time""",null,0,null,1432292485,null,0,false,0,crhbd0r,null,t3_36u6mt,null,t1_crhbd0r,null,t3_36u6mt,null,null,null,1433204864,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

The problem with your argument is that you can apply it to nearly anything such as legal drugs or ovens or knives, the difference here is that all these are not designed for regular recreational usage. Rarely are they going to get used once an hour every hour until the user goes to sleep as some smokers can and may do. Ovens and knives are not physically addictive and do not self promote their usage through drugs, legal drugs may however have that side effect and can potentially have negative side effects.

null,false,tusksrus,null,null,null,"&gt;Why? Chasing the student and potential student vote is useful for Labour

So why not instead offer a policy that helps students? Tution fees aren't paid up front unless you're wealthy enough to not be voting Labour anyway. The policy will only save the wealthiest graduates money in a couple of decades' time. It is totally irrelevant.

Offer more generous *maintenance* loans and grants instead. Something that actually affects students. Why do we get so hung up on the fees? They are the least important part and it's totally political positioning because of the Lib Dems' broken promise, rather than a policy with the aim of helping students.

Students know this.

&gt;I imagine the hope was it'd help them mop up Lib Dem student vote

They already have it - and it's such a marginal vote as to not be worth chasing anyway. Labour has and always has had ""the student vote"".

&gt;It also makes sense to drop the fees down to a level where more people will actually repay their loans—currently the fees are so high and the repayment terms set out as such that it's very, very likely for students to drop out of payments having left the government with a loss on their loan.

But by lowering the fees we're having the same effect as everybody not being able to pay back their final 3k. What is the point? It only loses money. A graduate tax is preferred, but reducing the fees only makes things less fair. It only saves money for the rich. And this is a *Labour* policy?

&gt;And, for people in love with the word ‘aspiration’, what's less aspirational than having to accrue a huge amount of mortgage-sized debt in order to get a bit of paper, necessary for nearly all the ‘aspirational’ jobs, that you'll spend the next two decades paying off?

It's not really debt. It doesn't behave like debt. It doesn't affect your credit rating, you don't have to make repayments regardless of circumstances, and the amount you repay is in line with how much you earn and paid before it goes into your bank account. You don't have to repay it at all after a fixed time and interest is charged in line with inflation. To call it debt, while technically correct, is dishonest. It is much more like a graduate tax with a maximum payable amount.

I *really* didn't like this pledge to reduce fees to £6k and it really summed up everything wrong with Miliband's leadership. It was a bad policy (which they hoped would be popular), but more importantly it was a bad *Labour* policy. It should be dropped.

This is my issue with your argument. When courts interpret the law, they are coming to a view on what the law says about a particular situation. A court's judgment in a particular factual situation should always be ""what the law says"" about that situation.

If we didn't have an international court, ""what the law says"" would be likely to change from country to country, based on the developing jurisprudence of courts in those countries. I think this is the incorrect way to approach human rights. The law should always say the same thing about human rights in every country, just because of what human rights mean. This is the fundamental issue I  have with removing the HRA, its a step away from *consistent* worldwide rights protection.

The other major issue with it, though this is only speculation, is that a British Bill of Rights is most likely going to offer less protection for rights than the Convention currently does, given that a big driver behind the whole idea is the ability to deport criminals to countries where they are likely to be tortured.

I think before the Villa game, something kicked the players backsides back into gear, we really can win or atleast get a draw here, and that could possibly be all we need, but we cant leave anything to chance. We need to demolish City like I know we can.

null,false,Cadwaladr,null,null,null,"While I’m a big fan of his work, rumours of Britain’s military decline are vastly overstated. To address some of Zakaria’s points:

Personnel numbers are nowhere near as important as they used to be, although they are the single most costly part of the defence budget in rich countries (think pensions etc). As personnel numbers can be scaled up and down a lot quicker than equipment programs, they are prime targets for cost savings in times of austerity.  Deriving an assessment of military strength based on personnel size has always been ridiculous, but even moreso today. Added to this, the historical size of the British Army has always been low. We have no tradition of a large standing force, the Cold War was an aberration in that regard. 

Power projection capabilities are mostly intact, and will be enhanced greatly with the IOC of the QE2 class carriers. Only a few nations have a capability that is anywhere near this.  

Innovative approaches to contracting (PFI, PbR etc) as well as significant levels of outsourcing for almost everything you can imagine (logistics, IT, estates, recruitment, training etc) means we arguably get more “bang” for our buck than almost any other nation on the planet. Single source regulation reform (for non-competitive tenders) in 2014 is also likely to lead to greater efficiencies in this area. I’m more than aware of the equipment cost overruns, but significant savings have been achieved in areas of the military estate most commentators simply ignore (back office, support, estates etc). Our ""teeth-to-tail"" ratio (fighting capability-support ratio) is amongst the best in the world. 

On a short term perspective, the risk of backbench revolt as a result of the slender Conservative majority is likely to lead to an effective freeze in deep cuts for defence over the next parliament.  

Could add a lot more, but currently at work - coincidentally writing a similar article to this one. In sum, it’s not as bad as everyone seems to think it is.

What is worse is they still have a monopoly on the desktop, which means you are FORCED to fund the company ever time you pay tax. Every hospital/school/police force uses MIcrosoft windows on their desktops - in 2015 this is insane.

The reason we are forced to fund the company via tax are outlined in the Halloween Documents -

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_Documents and you will see how it has happened...

It shows Microsoft's tactics to ensure that competition cannot reasonably exist - i.e not by competing fairly and making a better product but by taking existing standards and controlling them.
Its ok though Microsoft lawyers have bottomless pockets..

Tax payers around the world are forced to fund MS so the 'cancer' will still keep going strong, they will keep suppressing innovation for mankind...

What I mean is the fact that schools, hospitals, police, etc are all using Windows desktops still when there is absolutely no need (better) free alternatives exist - this is due to the fact they got a monopoly during the 90's when competition didn't really exist and use tactics outlined in the Halloween documents (at the end of the 90's) to keep their position by ensuring that competition cannot viably exist. (according to the EU in an illegal way)

And before anyone ways 'the Halloween docs were decades ago' they are still applying the same tactics today - its the reason why Microsoft make more money out of Android (a product they had nothing to do with) than their own 'windows phone' or whatever the piece of shit is called.

http://www.howtogeek.com/183766/why-microsoft-makes-5-to-15-from-every-android-device-sold/

http://thevarguy.com/open-source-application-software-companies/halloween-documents-microsofts-anti-linux-strategy-15-yea

Microsoft unlike many other patent trolls are seriously damaging society for everyone and WE all have to pay for it. 

i.e - they lobbied the UK government so they would 'abandon' their commitment to open standards (i.e making it worse for the entire of society and ultimately costing the tax payer more. )

http://thenextweb.com/uk/2012/01/09/uk-government-reportedly-caves-in-to-microsoft-on-open-standards-it-policy/

Anyone who has used Plasma 5 in Linux (KDE5) will know that the Linux desktop would be easy to use for any Windows 7 (or below) users, its easier than Windows 8.x.

Any arguments over retraining / remaking applications cost is invalid, yes there may be an initial cost but over decades you will save much money (look at Munich http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/07/munich-city-saves-millions-going-open-source) also you will likely have a system that is more stable and more secure...

As a rule the more difficult chain adjustment gets the less time you have till bearing failure.

The process is a pain the first time and requires a size 35 socket and an extra person to hold the back brake down.

Also there are massive redundancies within the EU's militaries that will not be ironed out until there is a central European Military Command.  Modern wars are fought largely by specialists, not infantry.      

Also if you combine Canada, USA, and Mexico -- which operate under [NAFTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement), you get an economic zone larger than the EU.

Here is a [list of providers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course#Emergence_of_MOOC_providers), Coursera, edX and Udacity are the largest (I think); FutureLearn is UK-specific. I would combine learning online with learning for a degree, things will go much smoother for you, especially during the exams.

If you're confident about being able to learn on your own and subject matter about your degree is available online freely, try going for a distance learning degree (even for ones outside the UK), they can be cheaper and you are able to work and earn money in parallel, but be wary, some employers don't like distance learning degrees, be sure to check how the hiring works in your field. Try tying your uni degree with your past job experience, it will be easier getting a job after you graduate.

It's definitely possible to be tough on 'big business' and frame it as helping small businesses and consumers, e.g.: by talking about breaking up monopolies *to encourage business and lower prices for consumers*; by regulating big business *to encourage small businesses and co-operatives*.

Apart from the vast majority of people who are employed by private businesses? I mean, I'm a big lefty and believe in strong workers' rights, but it is ludicrous to suggest that the enormous exodus of professional services to Frankfurt that would happen if we leave the EU would not have an enormous impact on millions of working people and their families. That is, unless one believes that you aren't really a 'worker' if you do white collar professional work. Even then, manufacturers would have a harder time exporting products to anywhere, meaning that those jobs would be at risk of moving. 

Builders and tradesmen might do a bit better because they would no longer have to be competitive against so many European foreign workers, who are willing to work harder for less. But that is quite a small gain compared to the millions whose jobs would be at risk. 

Plus, aside from opening up trade, our strongest protections for workers' rights come from the EU, and are exactly the sort of legislation that conservative Europhobes want to abolish, saying that they are 'red tape'.

So international communism fell out of favor for state socialism, which at first allowed slight regional variances in how socialism was implemented to occur, like in the largely Muslim held -stans.  Stalinism took hold, and all of the sudden no deviances in policy were allowed.  They were held in tight check with Sovietization -- read: Russification -- of the satellite states which was a major component of how the USSR dealt with domestic unrest by shuffling people around by the 10's of millions to lose their regional identities, and then cemented in place by repressive police state totalitarianism.

This is not a recipe for stable human societies, as we all saw in the spectacular 1991 collapse of the USSR.  However, state capitalism as in China allows the party elite to benefit economically disproportionately while at the same time raising standards of living for most, in exchange for denying rights to all under the guise of stability they claim is incompatible with Western-style liberty and human rights.  That sort of system is an easy sell to underdeveloped country's leaders and even people who are willing to give up national sovereignty and human liberty to receive China's aid.

The circle healthcare misadventure shows that private companies taking over in-debt NHS trusts (and most if not all NHS trusts are in debt) find it very difficult to monetise (presumably it's hard to completely trash worker's pay and split the difference for profit under current regulations (or at least do so without losing workers)) and make a profit.

However the lucrative bits will be hived off. This, as I am completely tired of hearing, will make very little difference to patients (or should, there have been examples where e.g.. private companies performing eye surgery have had shockingly high complication rates compared to NHS providers- in this case the NHS picked up the tab so trebles all round!). The trouble is that like all companies providing public service, the NHS trusts need to use the lucrative parts to cross subsidise the costly and necessary parts (critical care, emergency care, mental health). Privatising these lucrative parts means the NHS trusts will be driven further into debt.

The NHS is not an especially nice place to work. The reason they spend so much on private locum doctors is because they are not attracting enough medics to become full time employees. 
Another part is the current incentive to employ the minimum nursing and auxiliary staff possible to do the job, if there is then a crisis or a say a delirious patient who requires one to one supervision, the ward is then effectively short staffed as there is no give in the staffing levels. Hence the managers start phoning nurse banks and locum agencies at increased cost.

To add to the above. GP services are in crisis. GPs are not attracting enough doctors to become full time partners, as more and more partners reach the end of their careers the model of independently run GP practices starts to break as no one want to independently run a GP practice. The constantly negative press, ridiculous government access promises and initiatives and the reality of medicolegal responsibility means that doctors do not want to become GPs.

On top of all this the public demand on the NHS in terms of appointments needed and GP visits is increasing.

The endgame of all this (I think we can safely exclude massive public investment in the NHS for the foreseeable) is either: A system that, unable to ration care by time, starts to ration care by price and institutes fees for treatment. Or: A system that is not capable of providing adequate care, such that anyone who can afford to gets insurance and goes private.",null,0,null,1432296746,null,0,false,0,crhco7d,null,t3_36rwhw,null,t1_crhco7d,null,t3_36rwhw,null,null,null,1433205481,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

There's a phenomenon within the community known as 'burnout'.

Often large alliances, and even larger corps, tend to end up initially with very strong leaders in certain areas of the game. Logistics, fleet command, things like that.

If someone comes across as being great at something, they tend to get more stuff dumped on them - or they volunteer to do more and more, because they're already doing half the work themselves, so a little more can't hurt, or they actually kinda enjoy it.

Eventually these people become essential to the everyday function of their alliance, but also hugely overworked.

Then they get busy with something in real life, or some low-level alliance member complains about how this poor bastard doing all the heavy lifting was a day late with something, or alliance 'leadership' blames them for something stupid.

And one way or another they get totally fed up, disillusioned, and stop logging in. Maybe they go dramatically, maybe they steal everything as they go. The end result is the same.

The motivated, talented, experienced players needed to keep an alliance healthy are one by one promoted, overloaded, and then driven out of the group.

How is this relevant?

If Caroline Lucas was both sole MP and Party Leader, you're gonna cause burnout. You'll run her ragged and run her down.

I'm sure the telegraph knows this, I'm sure this is why this article exists. To drive the narrative that everyone (even your friends at the Telegraph!) thinks Caroline Lucas is brilliant, and that, oh, if only she was Party Leader as well, then the Greens would have come home on May the 9th with a majority in parliament.

No. You have to spread the work out. You have to pick the people you think are capable of leading, and get them out there. You've got to keep cultivating capable, confident leaders, so you can spread the workload around and delegate when you need to. Maybe Natalie Bennet wasn't the best choice, maybe she was the best one running. The Greens did pretty OK at this election regardless.


TLDR; Single-figure leadership is not resilient. It's a great way to take your best people and crush the passion out of them.

One point I will hang up on, though, is that, unlike an actual tax, the government can (and this one wants to) sell off the loanbook to a much less scrupulous private debt collection firm.  Then, given that it's AFAIK left quite a vague set of fixed requirements on how the loans are repaid, things get much hairier.

They didn't complain about bradford's pitch invasion (or whoever had one that round), claiming ""its the magic of the cup"", its fucking ridiculous. ( there was even one in the warrington match, crowding the commentators, they lapped that shit right up with ""the magic of the cup"" shit)

The BBC knew they had scheduled the game wrong and saw the opportunity to shift the blame onto villa. 

It was a great match, 3-4 years of relegation troubles, poor managers and poor players. Tim comes in, revitalised the dressing room, starts playing positive, attacking football, completely raises team morale and gets us scoring. Unarguably the best football i have seen villa play for about 5 years. These should be the talking points of the match, the turnaround in our season, but the BBC were too busy covering their own arses.

I would be laughing in the BBCs face come may 30 should we win, and I can't see us going 5-0, 3-0 down like in the league, it will the a great match and a chance for the players to prove themselves for the next season.

null,false,tusksrus,null,null,null,"&gt;I guess the question then is that, if students are focusing on the wrong thing, then 1) are they really, 2) why, and 3) how can we fix that?

I'm not sure students are focusing on any issue at all - it's the Labour party which saw the Lib Dems' broken promise and saw a nice and meaninglessly populist way to appeal. A big part of Labour's strategy was to appeal to disaffected Lib Dems. What they didn't count on was that there are relatively few lib/lab marginal seats - most are lib/con seats. Where did the Conservatives gain most..?

&gt;One point I will hang up on, though, is that, unlike an actual tax, the government can (and this one wants to) sell off the loanbook to a much less scrupulous private debt collection firm. Then, given that it's AFAIK left quite a vague set of fixed requirements on how the loans are repaid, things get much hairier.

This is definitely a good point and the *main* reason to oppose the fee and loan system in principle. It's worth mentioning that lowering tuition fees by £3k doesn't significantly impact on this problem - it misses the point (again). Which brings me to the next paragraph.

&gt;What is your opinion on fees in general? Should they theoretically eventually be cut as a low-priority policy if the government can afford it (and thus this policy was just bad prioritisation)? Or are high fees (and low direct university funding) justifiable?

A graduate tax is a better option, and what we should move to. I think it's entirely fair that those who benefit from a University education should pay, effectively, a marginally increased rate of income tax (always as long as it's progressive like income tax and like student loan repayments). The current system does do that, but the point you make in your second paragraph is the main reason we should move to a graduate tax. 

Lowering fees, though, is not the solution and only benefits the people who end up making the most money post-University. Apart from what you rightly say about the ability to sell loans, what we have at the moment is a graduate tax with a maximum payable amount (which is more beneficial to graduates than a ""real"" graduate tax would be). It just didn't make sense for the Labour party to promise to reduce fees - and Kendall would be right to scrap it.",null,0,null,1432300127,null,0,false,0,crhdzsk,null,t3_36s0cq,null,t1_crhdzsk,null,t1_crhdhxh,null,null,null,1433206176,null,1,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

Not just on software, you can quite happily run Debian8 on a ten yr old PC.

when the government decides to upgrade to Windows 8 or Windows 10 you can bet they will also upgrade their hardware - which WE will all pay for.

Also it would probably be easier for the average public sector worker to get to grips with Plasma5 than Windows8 (its not like most of them install their own software is it.)

The problem is that on reddit, there's a large number of people who think people who make ""false accusations"" should receive special punishment. An example would be the recent case of Ben Sullivan at Oxford University. This guy was accused of rape by more than one person, but due to insufficient evidence and contradictory statements, the police dropped the charges. One of the problems was that one of the victims told her friend via facebook that she was really drunk but she didn't think it was rape. Later she probably realised that what had happened was out of her control and could be classed as rape, and reported the incident to police. Of course, when the conversation was leaked, people immediately called for her head.

The point is this, rape victims find it hard to come forward at the best of times due to the trauma inflicted by that sort of attack. Introducing the risk of incarceration for making ""false"" accusations will only make it harder for victims to come forward.

You can probably go a lot faster - even round 90deg bends - than you expect. 20mph really slow.  
There could have been pedestrians, but just how close to the verge were you riding that they'd actually be an issue?

&gt; The dual carriageway incident I don't understand at all, I was going about 55-60 in the left lane, which I was happy staying in.

But the speed limit is 70mph.  
If it's not raining heavily, visibility is not reduced, and other traffic is not holding you up, then you are going too slow if you are not doing 70mph. You are not driving to the conditions of the road.

&gt; This lorry was behind me and apparently too close; now I don't see how I have any influence over how close this lorry driver chooses to drive behind me, I feel failing me because of this was quite unfair.

Because while he is limited to 60mph, you are not. You could have easily accelerated off without breaking the limit to increase the gap.
And it is very common to fail for the actions of others. As a biker, you need to anticipate what others are going to do. And you need to make up for their mistakes. If you had to do an emergency stop, does it really matter about the truck being in the wrong when you'd become a red stain on the road?

null,false,MinorBuzzKill,null,null,null,"It's all a question of control, when we signed up to the European convention on human rights back in the 50s it was not a part of our law so we essentially it was some nice words we agreed to diplomatically but didn't really enforce or do anything (us plucky Brits believed that this was a rule for the barbarians on the continent, we had a higher unwritten standard... a British standard). 

So fast forward 50 years and Tony Blair signs the thing into law in the UK in the form of the Human Rights Act. The other knock-on effect of this is that the House of Lords or now the Supreme Court is no longer the highest court in the land, essentially they can be over-ridden by the European courts. 

This gets conservative MPs angry for a number of reasons for starters they don't like to be told that what they are doing is a breach of human rights as was the case with prisoner's voting rights or that guy with a cat that Theresa May made a fuss over. They also don't appreciate having various courts in Europe making binding decisions over here when the UK Supreme Court cannot over-rule the verdict (it kinda takes the piss out of having supreme in the name if you're not). 

This leaves them with two potential options, either repeal or change enough of the Human Rights Act that it no longer functions in the same way and return us to the post war position. Or pass a new bill re-establishing the supreme court at the top of the chain, which is legislatively much murkier water.

The main reason for creating a British Bill of Rights instead of the HRA is to sever the link with the European courts and re-establish English Law as supreme in England at least. It is worth noting that this is not an uncommon approach from our European friends and many countries have their own bill of rights and are signatories to the convention. 

As for just quitting the convention (the magic third option) this would be a Pandora's box of bad PR, even Russia and Kazakhstan are signed up (in the completely useless 1950s-99 way of diplomatically agreeing but not passing it into law)",null,0,null,1432301924,null,0,false,0,crheuov,null,t3_36v0qr,null,t1_crheuov,null,t3_36v0qr,null,null,null,1433206580,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

The comparisons he's making with us selling players, compared to United, is a bit unfair. Out of the players he names; 3 went to Madrid and 2 went to Barca. You can't do much about that, those clubs have more pull than any other sides on the planet. They've took players from United, Arsenal, Bayern, Madrid, Juve etc. 

Plus players are leaving us because of a lack of on-field success rather than anything happening off the pitch. You think the club isn't trying to rectify that? It's a viscous circle; success breeds success, it doesn't just happen overnight. A fairer comparison towards our selling is with Arsenal, who have experienced the same thing but have come through it and are slowly becoming better and better despite years of selling their best players.

We've needed stadium improvements for a long time and it's always been in the works. Fact is we've had owners who lied to us and failed. Thankfully that is now history and FSG are making strides but Rome wasn't built in a day.

THERE ARE some images in our collective televisual past that are burned in the mind. In 1982, when I was 19, I saw a disturbing and raw documentary about Thames Valley Police that always stayed with me. Three male detectives interrogated a woman who reported that she had been raped earlier that day. Its brutality and cold-heartedness caused a sensation. The interview room, with its bland fluorescent light, cheap chairs and tables; its cast of characters sitting talking, hardly moving, hid possibly the most savage encounter between police and public ever recorded on television. The detectives involved were vilified, rape suites were set up almost overnight. Thames Valley was the target, but the detectives had been taught this approach at police college and interviews like this were happening everywhere.

Below is a transcript of the interrogation of the rape victim

The complainant has described how three men raped her, then gave her 16p for her bus fare...

Police officer Brian Kirk: (Shouting) Listen to me. I've been sitting here for 20 minutes, half an hour, listening to you. It's the biggest load of bollocks I've ever heard. I could get very annoyed very shortly... Stop mucking us all about.

C: I'm not mucking about.

K: I'm not saying you're lying. But get rid of all the fruitiness, get rid of the beauty about it.

C: (Crying) It's not beautiful at all.

K: Some of it is. All this crap about bus stops and tea towels to wipe yourself down with. What the hell's going on? If nothing's going on, let's pack it in and go home...

Police officer John McIntyre: I would agree that you have had sex this afternoon... but I think you've been a willing party... The story you've told us is a fairytale.

C: (Shouting) It happened!

K: I'm not saying it didn't happen. I'm talking about the embroidery...

M: We know what's happened here. You've had a hard time... You've had a long, long time of being treated for depression, haven't you? (Shouts) Haven't you?

C: (Nods)

M: You go to the pub, you meet a couple of fellas, they say, let's go back for a coffee and it all goes a bit far...

C: I didn't even know them before!

M: (Incredulous) You got into the car with them. You made no effort to get away from them...
K: I've met some that have been raped and they think their life is crumbling around their ankles like a pair of knickers with the elastic gone. Doesn't hold water this, does it? I'm not saying it's not true... I'm saying there's a lot more to this. Unfortunately we'll never hear the other side... All we've got is your side and you're making a fairytale out of it.

C: I'm not.

K: I think you are.

M: Do you realise when we have you examined, it will show whether or not you've had sexual intercourse with three men this afternoon?

C: I know. So it should show...

M: (Interrupts) It will confirm whether you've had sex with three men. If it does, then I say you went willingly... You could easily have run away. Easily... You're not frightened.

C: I was frightened.

M: You weren't. You show no signs of emotion. Every now and then you have a little tear... I spoke to your boyfriend... That's how I know all about your periods and when you last had sex... Why on earth didn't you scream and shout ?...

K: (Bored) Do you or do you not want to make a complaint of rape?

C: No, I don't.

 If you think the train can be trusted to the police, I don't think you've ever been on a train. People often drink on trains, among other things, so of course there has to be somebody there who is on the train for the safety of the other passengers. Its really not much of a debate - there's no benefit to removing train guards except to save money. And the companies that own the rail networks can afford the expense. 

The police are suffering serious budget cuts anyway, so I doubt they'd have the staff to man every train. Even if they did, that would  be shifting the cost of protecting the trains from the private companies to the taxpayer. 

And by the way, Thomas the Tank Engine is not a documentary. The trains are not sentient and require human input to function. This is why they have a driver. Getting rid of the driver isn't an option, for what i thought were really obvious reasons. You can't fire people on the grounds that one day automation will remove the need for their job.

EDIT: At any rate, I'm only talking from my experience and from what I've heard from people with decades of railway experience. Maybe guardless trains would function for the London networks, but most trains up north go through the middle of nowhere and it wouldn't be safe to have them unmanned.

Yeah, but not very usefully. Nobody just wants a bare OS. Firefox will not run happily on something that old, let alone the monstrosity that is LibreOffice or Thunderbird. If you want a modern-looking DE you're looking at Unity or Gnome Shell which probably both want half-decent graphics support by now for no good reason.

You do actually need some heft to produce a functional, productive, Linux workstation.

I'm commuting to my Uni, about 30 miles away, and have managed to keep my ""Full Time"" course (12 Hours of lectures a week!) confined to two days in the week, and work the other three days of the week where I was working before. I've also been able to do overtime during holidays etc, and with the reduced income, it means I'm paying less in tax and with Student Loans and Grants I think I've actually earned more since last April than I had in previous years.

null,false,ndphillips,num5-away,,null,"I'm often on the ""Yay, stats!"" wagon, but I don't think these tell the whole story.

Lavezzi, one must remember, is not struggling to get into the squad because he's not playing well. He's struggling because two spots, Ibra and Cavani, are already determined and PSG want to play younger players, Pastore (who has been nothing short of awe-inspiring this season) and Lucas, for when the oldies leave.  Thus, he's often subbed on or off, to accommodate the other players. 

However, it bears saying, that when Lucas/Pastore play, Lavezzi is always subbed on, so he's definitely an important player for PSG.

What the OP said, but the stats don't, is about how much space Lavezzi creates. One of the reason Ibra scores so many goals is because he has oceans of space that Pocho creates. He often drags defenders in a way I've rarely seen other players do. He's quick and incisive, which means he has to be marked closely. 

Now, with him creating space, it should open Kane up for more room to work, room that's rarely been afforded him in the past few months. If they still focus on Kane, they'll leave too much room for Lavezzi to exploit. 

Defenses would have to mark-out Lavezzi (a difficult task), Kane, and Eriksen. Obviously, better teams like Chelsea may be able to do this. But I can't see Sunderland doing it effectively.

From an economic standpoint I think emphasizing the fantastic potential of economic stimulus targeted on infrastructure and construction would be a good idea. Labour (employing lots of people) and resource intensive (using a diverse range of materials) jobs like building railways and houses not only give a great boost to the economy in the short term but also facilitate economic expansion in the long term. Plus that would ease off the strain on the housing situation... it's good for the economy *and* can make low cost homes a reality for millions of people. All of which could be financed at government borrowing when credit is historically cheap, raising taxes a little if you like (the really crazy Keynesians like the 1970s Tory Chancellor Anthony Barber went for the raise spending and cut taxes line)...and inflation isn't even on the horizon. With that in mind closing tax loopholes and Falklands/West Sussex oil are just bonuses. The possibilities are really quite wonderful. Once the economy was growing more long-term dedicated investment in, for example, education could be introduced too. 

Add to that a mix of political reforms along the line of proportional representation, campaign finance reform and recall elections and you have something truly great I think.

null,false,djimonia,lfc99,,null,"Ugh, this article is frustrating. Three thoughts: 

1. **Club Identity:** It panders a bit to those who would like to see us spend a lot of money today to keep up with other ""top 4 clubs"" and to challenge for the domestic double or the treble every year. We don't have a fundamental right to win anything because we have ""history."" We have tradition as a club, and there's the ""Liverpool way"" with attractive (usually attacking) football and ""pass and move"" as hallmarks. Thankfully these are still modern and relevant concepts which we can continue with. Trophies aren't a right, we have to win them. We don't belong in the top 4 because we have history, but because we have potential. FSG is obviously playing the long game, but they are coming around to the fact that every season we are rebuilding and we are a long way from a position on which to build on. I am not sure we will get there with their current transfer strategy. I hope the new stand will mark a new beginning, but I worry we may be far, far behind by then.

2. **Transfers**: The committee must go. Absolutely. I don't know what they replace it with, but it cannot be worse than what we have now. Additionally, I would rather we be forced to rely on youth to plug gaps because we blew extra money on game-changing Sanchezes and Costas of the world. Good players attract more good players as well. Who wouldn't want to play with Suarez? or Torres? or Alonso? or Sanchez/Costa? At some point, a ""project"" is impossible to sell when you have literally leveraged everything - ""youth"" and ""talent"" mean nothing to someone who want to win things in at most 2-3 years. Instead we end up signing potential or breakthrough players for lots of money to try to cover all positions and miss out on the because we just couldn't sway the quality ones with extra dosh in the final 100m sprint. We have a good academy, we should trust it a lot more than we do today. If you think we are already doing that, especially given our financial position for the next 2-3 years, you are mistaken.  
  
3. **Stadium:** Neville is correct about the stadium. We should have built a new stadium in the 90s or the 2000s, but we repeatedly did not, and are paying the price for it. Additionally, our commericial operations were piss-poor for decades, and we did not develop a Brand Liverpool the way Dortmund, who went from glory to irrelevance back to media and public darling in a decade, and Atletico have done recently. 

Just a side-note, I wish Brendan was a more fearsome (not passionate) manager - it's the only aspect of his personality that I wish could be changed. He is too ""nice"" - this persona he has cultivated is too soft for him to take that step up and have your players run through walls for you. This is the only way I see us punching above our weight until we have refurbished Anfield and can put a bit more money into the market.

I started at age 42 with wife and kids. There are a couple of grants you get which the young uns who are still at home applying don't. The easiest thing to do is to go onto the Student Loan website and do an application. Before you finally submit it it'll give you figures for the maintenance and other grants you'll be eligible for.

In regards to the not having A levels, depending on the degree you may find you struggle like holy hell especially if it involves maths.

I know. But there is no good mail client for Linux, and the choice of office suites are the ones that will eat all your ram (LO and OOo) or ones that don't play well with others (abiword/gnumeric etc.). What would you install on your standard company-issue PC for someone who has to read documents coming from other companies?

&gt;  The actual PC hardware isn't really a huge proportion of the cost of the computer.
&gt;&gt;Is it when the tax payer has to shell out for new hardware each time local gov updates their OS (i.e like now.)

Who is paying for it doesn't really affect the proportion of the cost. When I was last doing it, a PC with its licenses (Windows and Office) cost ~£300 and lasted at least three years. More than £100/year would be spent on managing the user/software interaction - supporting the thing. And Windows is much easier to support than is Linux. Partly because of genuine features like AD and Group Policy and partly because of extant market share meaning that everyone writes software for it, and most people know how to use it. Also, Windows admins are much cheaper than Linux ones.

That it might be more ethically right or whatever to not use Windows doesn't really change the fact that it's often the more economically sesible thing to do. As a Linux user/advocate I did find it quite tricky to deal with that the first few times I genuinely tried to get a company to make more use of Linux.

Arsenal was a bit different, but they have had excellent ability to attract investors, and have one of the best managers in world football who is potentially one of the very few who could keep them relevant during their periods of financial constraint due to the Emirates.

&gt;Oh can't you? I'm sure you'll be fighting for the rights of horse and cart drivers too then? 

Well, if people tried to fire horse and cart riders in the mid 1800s on the grounds that in a few decades their jobs would be gone - yes I'd say that was stupid. Good luck running the trains without the drivers. Are you gonna try and fire lorry drivers and taxi drivers before their job is automated too? Why not fire cancer specialists too? Cancer will be cured soon enough. Train drivers should be gradually shifted into other jobs where their experience would be useful - in due time. We still need them to drive the trains, because it is 2015 and not a few decades into the future.

&gt;I don't know why you have this weird idea that ticket inspectors are these all powerful people, they literally do nothing but check tickets and fine people who don't have one. Other than that they are civilians, no powers of arrest at all.

I literally addressed this in the previous post - they have *train*ing (get it) to deal with the incidents they might come across. I'd rather have trained people on board who know what to do in the event of an emergency (which you keep denying for some reason) than a long wait time for the police or to just be left to it myself.

&gt;If the trader does not let you cancel the order or insists you have to buy the items at the higher price, you will need to find out whether you have a contract or not. If you do have a contract, the trader would normally have to sell the goods or services at the agreed price, based on what was advertised.

&gt;If you have a contract and you think the pricing error wasn’t an obvious mistake, you should write to the trader, asking them to let you buy at the original price.

null,false,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,null,"&gt;Iran is not even close to shaping anything at the scale of the World Bank and NATO, both solidly entrenched Americentric/Eurocentric institutions.

Absolutely. But at times this has happened in spite of military power, not because of it. (That's not to say that military strength is completely unnecessary: I'll come to that below.)

I'm not suggesting that Iran is in any way in the same league (or even a few leagues below)  the US and EU. But the US started out the 21st century in an incredibly strong geopolitical position, and now it's weaker. While Iran started in an incredibly weak position  and now it's a bit stronger, mostly at the expense of KSA.

I'm not sure FDI receipts is a useful proxy for geopolitical strength. The UK receives almost as much as the US and has nowhere near as strong position. And FDI can allow other countries undue influence. As capital is becoming less important, I expect to see the usefulness of FDI in an economy declining. (Which isn't to say that Russia or Iran have got there. They are behind the curve on this,)

China is already quietly rising, and by and large without the use of its military. China is buying land and influencing governments in Asia and Africa, and investing in infrastructure everywhere. According to your list they are at #4 now, and they are using FDI fairly astutely to entrench their geopolitical position.

This is something of a zero sum game, and China risks its clients falling to proxy wars. This is where its military spending will be useful.

Sure you can get things to work together but it all feels very disjointed. Windows is much easier to set up and deploy. Linux has its place but at a general desktop level probably not much. Organisations pay for support because they need to function and need access to solutions and fixes because the computer drives the person that drives the company, its too risky to use free unsupported software.

I told them I couldn't do it then and it wasn't until after it passed that they rescheduled it. So it was officially recorded as me missing the urine test, which is why it ended up being a hair follicle test.

Because it wasn't frequent use, was fairly long ago, and I had just got my hair cut. They test the most recent inch and a half of hair and I didn't even have that much to give him so it really shouldn't test that far back.

I've said before that I used to think Newcastle fans were being twats when they had Allardyce, because I didn't watch them properly. But now I know. 

Listened to the kumb podcast a couple weeks back and they said it best, Sam has shit PR. If he had someone feeding him the odd line about how he loves the club or whatever, instead of coming in and saying we're all delusional in his first presser as manager, he would immediately have won the fans over. Instead, he decided to be an arrogant prick and further alienate those who were skeptical in the first place. I firmly believe that if he came across as a more likeable man who genuinely wants to achieve and improve with the club, he'd be getting another contract. But because he doesn't care what anyone thinks of him, he says whatever he wants and does whatever he wants, the atmosphere around the club is awful and the only way to solve it is to say, ""thanks for everything, but it's time to part ways"". 

It also fucks me off how everyone says we're ""sacking"" him. No, we're just not taking the option of renewing his contract.

I'm a sucker for stupid one-liners.

She recognizes that Labour should support an EU referendum (it would be silly to oppose it now it's happening anyway - obviously), though she's hardly the only candidate to do so.

She's said that that energy price freeze lie of Miliband's was not believable (it wasn't), that the Government should back any successful school (it should), that the pledge to reduce tuition fees should not be a priority (which it shouldn't; particularly as it misses the point completely).

It's sad that you might be right about her not securing enough support from the Parliamentary party - and the membership might not back her either.

i) people who are inconvenienced by industrial action when it takes place

ii) people who are treated badly in their own workplace and have learnt to accept that they are underpaid and undervalued, and resent other people who ask for fair pay and fair increases

iii) media spin (trade union barons, etc)

What you don't see day to day is all the advice and representation we do; providing direction on company's policies (because your employer will be damn quick to use those policies when THEY want something, but bloody sluggish when it comes to something you want, like flexible working, pay increase, etc.) through to legal support such as paying those outrageous tribunal fees - but only when we're assured it's not a frivolous case.

A couple of things I'll challenge from a few other posts I've read on this bit so far, rather than adding new stuff...

- 'defending members even when they're in the wrong' - nope, no shop steward or officer should do this, and I can hand on heart say that I had to give some hard feedback to members when they were accused of things that they'd actually done - reminding them that the union is not a get out of jail card.  I cannot think of a single instance where we would propose strike action for someone who has actually done something wrong.  Where it's unproved, evidenced, yes - but never when it's deserved that the member is booted.
- American unions - according to some of my friends in America, there are still unions run over there like mafia offshoots rather than representation and advice bodies; one can only hope they'll wither and die like the corrupt set-ups they are
- they're run by dictators, etc. - then the members should stop them being run by those people; the members and branches have abilities to hold people like the general secretary to account for their behavior, and the GS should not act without mandate of the members (this was what caused a huge crack allowing the dismantling of the unions in the 1980s, specifically the Miners Union, when industrial action was taken without proper democratic process.)
- 'trade unions stand in the way of progress' - difficult one this; it's usually used by people when it comes to train drivers being replaced by automated systems.  Of course people are going to stick up for their jobs; who the hell would want to support a system that does them out of work.  However, you'll tend to find that progressive, successful workplaces (Jaguar Landrover for example) is well organised, in profit, and generally behaves fairly towards its members, so they enjoy good pay reward and great employee satisfaction and productivity.",null,0,null,1432309456,null,0,false,0,crhiwxt,null,t3_36t9lc,null,t1_crhiwxt,null,t3_36t9lc,null,null,null,1433208494,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,dougie_g,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,null,"&gt; Why would there be an enormous exodus to Frankfurt ? 

Well...

&gt; London will always be one of the key financial centres of the globe . 

Why? Frankfurt and Paris are now big financial centres in their own right, but London's strength is to have a foot on both camps, sort of straddling the Atlantic. The main reasons that London retains its predominance are history, infrastructure, the reliable legal system, AND being an excellent gateway into Europe for all manner of financial services and trade. But if you take away that last one, then suddenly it isn't that competitive because the access to Europe is an enormously important factor. Our legal system is more reliable than the rest of Europe (because courts are mandated to follow precedent unlike in civil law systems) but it's not as if Germany's legal system is a mess. And history doesn't really cut it from a business perspective when suddenly you are unable to do European trade without an office or partner in Frankfurt or Paris. London would become what Frankfurt is now - the centre of a strong economy - but would no longer be the business capital of the continent. 

&gt; I can see Japanese car manufacturers leaving as they use us to build and import to Europe . But where else will we lose , what do we sell to Europe now that they won't want to buy ? 

Hopefully I have explained above that it is more complex than that. What we now 'sell' is not so much goods as services. Legal services, financial services, accountancy, advertising, creative industry, design, management. Most of those rely enormously on access to Europe in order to operate effectively. 

&gt; As for employment law , forget it , we already lost that fight since Thatcher

I mean, sure the unions can't grind everything to a halt any more but we have pretty great laws on working hours and holidays compared to 90% of the rest of the world. It would  be nice to have better protections against being fired, and get rid of non consensual zero hour contracts. I hate Thatcher as much as the next man but I think this sentiment is a bit defeatist.

Then to top it off you have to subject yourself to a profoundly silly ceremony where you pledge you life and loyalty to the service of Lizzy2 in some jumped-up jamboree complete with robes and bibles and flags - that any right-thinking Englishman would find frankly embarrassing.

The reason EU citizens living in the UK aren't generally in a rush to apply for citizenship is because the entire process is costly, pointless hassle. Not because they're secretly planning to sell off Wembley and Big fucking Ben to the Chinese and then bugger off back to bloody Bamburg with the loot.

Is your PC okay at what it does? Get the watch. Those games you've your eye on will be a fraction of the price in 12 months, as will the hardware needed for optimal experiences. The watch will be the same price and the spec. demands for timekeeping are pretty consistent.

Perhaps it's not quite as good as I remember it, but I just love how hard he hit it and the celebration afterwards. It doesn't really get remembered since it's a game we lost handsomely.

&gt; BBC TRANSCRIPT TO BE USED IN WAKE OF NUCLEAR ATTACK

&gt; This is the Wartime Broadcasting Service. This country has been attacked with
nuclear weapons. Communications have been severely disrupted, and the number of
casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known. We shall bring you
further information as soon as possible. Meanwhile, stay tuned to this
wavelength, stay calm and stay in your own homes.

&gt; Remember there is nothing to be gained by trying to get away. By leaving your
homes you could be exposing yourselves to greater danger.

&gt; If you leave, you may find yourself without food, without water, without accommodation and
without protection. Radioactive fall-out, which follows a nuclear explosion, is many
times more dangerous if you are directly exposed to it in the open. Roofs and
walls offer substantial protection. The safest place is indoors.

&gt; Make sure gas and other fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are
extinguished. If mains water is available, this can be used for fire-fighting.
You should also refill all your containers for drinking water after the fires
have been put out, because the mains water supply may not be available for very
long.

&gt; Water must not be used for flushing lavatories: until you are told that
lavatories may be used again, other toilet arrangements must be made. Use your
water only for essential drinking and cooking purposes. Water means life. Don't
waste it.

&gt; Make your food stocks last: ration your supply, because it may have to last for
14 days or more. If you have fresh food in the house, use this first to avoid
wasting it: food in tins will keep.

&gt; If you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given, stay in your
fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out. When the immediate
danger has passed the sirens will sound a steady note. The ""all clear"" message
will also be given on this wavelength. If you leave the fall-out room to go to
the lavatory or replenish food or water supplies, do not remain outside the room
for a minute longer than is necessary.

&gt; Do not, in any circumstances, go outside the house. Radioactive fall-out can kill. You cannot
see it or feel it, but it is there. If you go outside, you will bring danger to your family and you
may die. Stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out or you
hear the ""all clear"" on the sirens.

&gt; Here are the main points again:

&gt; Stay in your own homes, and if you live in an area where a fall-out warning has
been given stay in your fall-out room, until you are told it is safe to come
out. The message that the immediate danger has passed will be given by the
sirens and repeated on this wavelength. Make sure that the gas and all fuel
supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished.

&gt; Water must be rationed, and used only for essential drinking and cooking
purposes. It must not be used for flushing lavatories. Ration your food supply:
it may have to last for 14 days or more.

&gt; We shall repeat this broadcast in two hours' time. Stay tuned to this
wavelength, but switch your radios off now to save your batteries until we come
on the air again. That is the end of this broadcast.",null,0,null,1432315509,null,0,false,0,crhloce,null,t3_36vgjj,null,t1_crhloce,null,t1_crhi4qx,null,null,null,1433209865,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Celtic 2014 Annual Audit page 45:

http://cdn.celticfc.net/assets/downloads/Celtic_Report_2014.pdf

Wages and Salary: £33.5m

Total football and admin staff: 157

Total admin and retail staff: 318

If you give 6m to 445 staff that's £13,400 on average which is just above minimum wage on a 40 hour week. Some people will be part time, some will earn a decent bit above minimum wage.

That leaves £27.5m (42.5% of the clubs total revenue) for 30 first team players, which equals an average wage of £17,628 per week. Once you take tax into consideration you'll probably see around £11,000 on average hit a first team player bank account every week.

&gt;Nah lets just insult the other guy'

Just thought it would get through to you. 

&gt;Outsourcing their job to the public sector is just stupid, it only serves to save money for the train companies

This just shows how much you've been eating up the propaganda put out by people like Mick Cash. It's not outsourcing things to the public sector, its putting people who have actually had training (i.e. not a one day course) and the powers (power to detain and arrest) in charge of the situations because guess what, anti-social and violent behaviour is the responsability of the police, not ticket inspectors. I would much much rather have a police officer on hand in an emergency than a ticket inspector, especially since police officers familiar with the railway exists and in fact there's a whole police force dedicated to policing the railway. Perhaps you've heard of them? They're called the British Transport Police. 

Also you're only argument against automated trains is that they're decades into the future? [I'm afraid I have some bad news for you](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_automated_urban_metro_subway_systems). It's a matter of years, not decades before this technology can be applied to other railways.

And as for:

&gt;Why not fire cancer specialists too? Cancer will be cured soon enough.

I personally know many cancer specialists, I share a lab with a research group dedicated to prostate cancer research and I know a lot of oncologists (thats what clinical cancer specialists are called). **NONE** of them would ever dream of standing in the way of advances in technology because it may put them out of a job (in fact they'd be ecstatic) so don't be so fucking stupid. 

Finally you suggest that train drivers should have jobs found for them before we automate things? Surely it's their own responsibility to find a job for themselves? Thats the way the rest of the country works (along with not getting pay rises for nothing) so I will ask once again. What makes train drivers so special? So much better than everyone else in the country? Why are they deserving of handouts? Because that's exactly what pay rises above inflation without increased performance or responsability are, handouts.

On current form, I'd say Hart is at least on par with most of the ones I included in that second list, save for maybe Lloris.

But include Hart above those names, and you'd see people argue.

It absolutely is. State Socialism is an authoritarian ideology. Noam Chomsky even [calls State Socialism an oxymoron](http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionI1). USSR and Cuba were/are 100% socialist: planned economy and all. China is changing from that to laissez faire neoliberalism but the state is still huge and most things are centralised. 

I think people just don't vote for policies, they vote emotionally. They believe basic left-wing/right wing differences being the right is good for business and is pragmatic while the left is better for when times are good and that's it.

The centre is  car-free so best option will be living south of the centre. My recommendation would be off Abingdon Rd in or near Grandpont. When i first moved to Oxford I lived there and its really close walking distance to the centre yet with great access to the south. You've also got beautiful walks along the canal and river just on your doorstep, as well as outdoor swimming pool, tennis courts, and park. 

The further south you go down Abingdon rd the more at risk of flooding you are though. Anything south of Lake St is at risk for a liitle bit of a flood for a week roughly every 4-5 years, though this isnt too bad and more of an annoyance for traffic more than anything.

Alternatively across the other side of the Thames, East Oxford is great, really lively (which is a good or bad thing depending on your preference). Loads of students along the Cowley Rd and roads between there and Iffley Rd. But once you get down as far south as Donnington Bridge they thin out so it wont be too noisy at night. And youve got straight access out to the south from there. Lots of big houses with roomshare there. And youve got nice cafes there and Cowley Rd restaurants and shops are still nice and close.

Abingdon Rd is great if youre commuting out to the south. By 20 mins south do you mean your office is moving to Abingdon? There are great bus routes from Abingdon Rd to Abingdon. This will be useful if you dont want to spend money on petrol (Gas).

The detectives sit down with your friend and she tells them:

*""A man I know raped me. I know I should have reported it straight away, but I wasn't thinking straight so I went home, washed away any biological evidence and waited several days meaning there aren't even any bruises left to show you.""*

The detectives are much more appropriately trained and sensitive than the ones in the 1980s documentary. So they tell her it's ok, they understand how traumatic it must have been and they will do what they can to investigate her case.

*""No no""* she tells them *""I don't want to press charges against him. I just thought I should let you know. So you can put a note on his file or something.""*

That isn't how it works. That isn't how any of this works.

Our population growth is simply too high.

Why is that? Forced mass immigration. That is why. Some people have already started resenting it, and others will follow if it is not stopped. History will tell you that. Look at what happened in Ancient Rome when stuff went to shit there, they literally slaughtered ""barbarian"" families in the city for being outsiders.

You completely trust giving them the ball under any circumstance and when they are playing on your team, you feel more at ease even if your team is losing. Suarez gave the whole team this confidence and fighting spirit. We have good players, but they are young. Even our captain looked hesitant and nervous the past few seasons. Last Year Suarez was the only one in our team who had this belief, and since he was also our best player, it affected the whole team. This season the only players with 100% belief that we have in our squad are Can, Enrique and Sahko. Enrique doesn't get minutes, Sahko is injured, and Can is stuck playing defense.

The fact that we won it on the last day last year just means we faced stiffer competition from the top 4 as compared to Chelsea this year; three teams finished above 80 points last year and fourth place had 79 points (which is where will be if we beat S'oton). Chelsea could have had the exact same results they've had this year in all 38 games, including against us, but if we didn't have that horrendous dip they wouldn't have been able to run away from it as easily. But would you really think less of their season if they had the exact same results? Would you really think less of the job Jose has done?

Pellegrini's team last year produced one of the more electric seasons in Premier league history. It shouldn't have been held against him that he faced stronger competition from the top 4, especially when Liverpool's lack of European games meant they were usually 1-2 GPs ahead of us.

Big Sam has always preferred physical attacking players over finesse, especially in the middle and at striker. Zarate had great dribbling and shooting, but he was easily knocked off the ball and didn't respond well to contact. IMO the pros outweighed the cons. He clearly could find ways to put the ball in the back of the net, which is all that matters.

So because Zarate fell down the pecking order due to Sam's preferences, there were instances in the early/mid season where Nolan and Cole were either starting or being subbed on ahead of him. This didn't sit well with fans or Zarate. He had a reputation for a difficult attitude before coming here. After a few weeks of obvious and bizarre snubs, twitter rumors of discontent from Zarate starting appearing. These rumors were attributed to a family member/agent, and Zarate was quick to say publicly that he didn't say he was unhappy. However, the situation continued to deteriorate and Zarate went out on loan. On his way out, Zarate and Sam took parting shots at each other in the media.

I believe that the Zarate situation is a microcosm of why Sam is losing his job.

Also, under the [Code of Practice for Victims of Crime](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/254459/code-of-practice-victims-of-crime.pdf) when someone reports a serious crime such as rape it's the officer's duty to indicate services which may be of use to them and, depending on their age and whether they are viewed as a vulnerable/intimidated victim (which it sounds like she might be), there's a lot of hand holding support available to guide and encourage them through the process of pressing charges and going to court.

We have players that have massive potential but at the same time can be molded to play a style of football. (Like an engine running smoothly. Something thats from Cryuffs school of thought.) In this case even if a big player leaves, the collective effort of the team easily makes up for the loss. 
The main problem is, and this is my honest opinion, that we don't quite have a ready made manager. We again have a manager that has (or may not have) massive potential. Rodgers also needs to grow as a manager along with the players. This season like you pointed we had 7 new players. More importantly two strikers who just dont fit in the high tempo forward press. It works perfectly when you have a player who can do that, but what if we are missing him? (Sturridge, this season). In this case you need to at least try to accommodate the strikers you have. Now I dont quite know what the best way to do that was, but clearly we were sorely lacking balance. Now I dont know if this was because of Rodgers personal traits, but it was evident to see that he was clueless at times. We just need to find one or two natural goal scorers.

The way Sleeping_At_Last phrased it makes it sound like she decided not to press charges, *and then* went to the police. Not that the police disuaded her from pressing charges. 

I'm sure the police have guidelines for victims who come forward and want to press charges, and for victims who they discover during investigations who didn't want to come forward. But for someone to come forward to report a crime and then tell them that they don't want to press charges; that's pretty confusing.

Without immigration we need 250,000 homes built every year, it sounds a lot but isnt really. up to 350,000-400,000 were built post war every year for decades.

The problem is that since social housing was stopped from being built by the Tories and their new labour clones the private sector has sat on its fat arse instead of responding to demand.
We havent built 250,000 homes a year since the late 1980's. 
Immigration only really took off in 2005 onwards with the A8 countries getting the right to move here.  

Blame should be apportioned to The Tories, New Labour, the big builders eg Barrat homes and the banks for compounding this shit sandwhich by stoking a house price bubble with what is left.
