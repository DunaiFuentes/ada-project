Skrtel was a beast. Lovren played well (wish he would stop with the Hollywood passes, they all end up skying to a defender).

allen looked much better in the 2nd half. hendo and milner are what they are. not much to say - beginning to expect these types of performances because we don't see anything else. very good. Ibe needs to get a couple of assists and a goal or two under his belt and i think the end product decision making will be quicker. he's second guessing himself. Lallana is getting better with each passing minute. he's going to be giving someone a serious run for starting XI. Origi needs to keep working. it will come. he's extremely raw.

The City of Westminster, later becoming London, was built next to it and surrounded it. Both of them have separate local governments and the CoL gets many privileges nowhere else in the UK gets. The CoL gets to send an advocate into Parliament called the Remembrancer who ensures that any laws passed that would affect the CoL in a way it doesn't like contains an exception for them. Their local government is voted for primarily by the leftovers of medieval guilds and modern corporations that do business there, residents actually have a minority of the votes.

Thanks for doing this.
I recently rejoined the party after just saying 'fuck it' after the secret court decision. I guess Tims got a lot of work to do to earn the party the right to call itself Liberal again after that.

As a liberal, i'm untrustworthy of anyone holding power. I'm especially untrustworthy of someone who holds power in an implicit way, that people would not question that power or the person that holds it. If that person isn't elected, I'm even more concerned, although I can imagine that if someone holding such power stood for election they would almost win by default.

So I have to ask - why does your cult status within the party persist, especially as through all of the BS that the tories threw at us during coalition, you were the one telling us to hold our ground? Are you comfortable with it? Do you recognise how much power is implicitly invested in you by party members and what steps do you take to keep yourself accountable?

In non-conformity,

Have a look. 

Oh and I am a FY2, the salary is 28,000 quid a year. BUT you are talking about a final year trainee in a speciality. 

Okay. Here are some differences. 

1. Most people on the national average are on 26 grand after tax or
http://www.netsalarycalculator.co.uk/34000-after-tax/ £34,000 a year. More than what I would earn if I wasn't working abroad as a charity doctor. The post I mentioned was another doctor's point. Note I would earn BELOW the national average. 

2. You have had the same educational opportunities as me. You had the same chances. The same free education that I utilised till the end of 6th form. I used the same free books, school and local library to do my work as other people. I know I am not smart or else I would have gone into law or hell become  a banker or trader and walked away with way more money but I chose to become a doctor and I did so through hard work. Hard work that people I was friends with were not willing to sacrifice to do. You cannot expect what I have achieved to come on a plate. One cannot play for Manchester United by sitting on their arse watching telly. One cannot be a doctor without the work. I put it up aged 15 to 18 when a lot of my peers were larking around. When my friends got B's that was good. I needed A*s. You cannot expect the same opportunity to come for you if you don't work towards it. 

3. You don't have an £80K risk. Most doctors do. It's a hefty loan and you lose a large chunk of your actual salary to it. Most of those other ""national averagers"" didn't take the risk of such a loan. 

4. Hours? Doctors regularly work overtime without pay. And as I pointed out, most doctors have worked on weekends. You cannot work every weekend because that's stupid. You do need time to relax and have a life. But you work to the job not to the hours. It's 9 to 5 roughly. Sometimes that means 9 to 9. My personal favourite story? I once worked from 8 AM on a Tuesday to 11 PM on a Wednesday. In that same time I went through 5 nursing shifts. AKA 5 people fitting into the normal work schedule of a nurse went through. 

5. The responsibility. I am responsible for my patients. If a nurse in my ward screwed up an order, I have to take the heat to find out what and whose fault is it. The difference between me and the nurse is this. I have to make the decisions. If I am leading a code, I am the one who has to decide when to stop and what the treatment plan is. That responsibility is why I am paid. Oh it's easy sometimes. Give a tetanus shot, put some stitches in. But there will be a time in everyone's career when something goes wrong. And everyone on the ward will turn and look at you. That is why you are paid that salary. Because you took on the responsibility where no one else would. You are expected to do the dirty job of being in charge. If it works you work. If it doesn't then you have the honour of going and talking to the patient if you are lucky and the next of kin if you are not. 

6. There are a variety of skills that require an incredible amount of specialisation that most people do not have. 

7. I deal with shit that makes normal people gag. Ever had to disempact a bowel? Or clean the dressings on a patient with bad bedsores? Or deal with myasis and evict maggots living in a homeless man's flesh? 

8. I have to work on weekends. I have to write papers. Keep up professional learning. Learn something new. Keep on top of recent medical achievements and keep on top of paper work. 

That's the difference. You want to compare a job that WITH its advanced training is still shorter and cheaper than medical school, has far less stress and is far less hours to a job that literally requires you to understand a human body inside and out within your field as well as have a functional knowledge of the entire human body. 

And your argument is ""well you earn double and that's unfair"". Then do the same job. Everyone tells me my job is easier but no one wants to do it. Make that decision where someone can die. 

Work those hours. 
Make those sacrifices. 
Take that responsibility. 
Make as close to no mistakes as possible. There is no whoopsies.
See the cost of healthcare. Break an old woman's ribs who shouldn't be given CPR cause you know it's not useful. Watch a child die. Wade through gore and still smile when you see the next patient.

Then we can talk about your earnings not being the same as what many of your doctors do.

Oh and since you asked? My fiancee often has to work 12 days on 2 days off. It's around 9.70 an hour. If she worked in ANY other job she would be making time and a half for ever hour she worked over 40 and double for unsocial hours like weekends to boot. Basically? She would be a lot richer if that were the case  but no she's only taking around 23,000 quid after taxes home. 

To put this into perspective. I am 30. I have never been to Ibiza or on holiday to Europe. I haven't had a holiday in the past 6 years. I have days off that I spend sleeping to recover from the stress of work. I am planning my first holiday in 6 years this year. Why? Cause I want one and I finally have the time. 

That's why the salary is high. It's only an easy job cause you see it on TV as people reading off a script.",null,0,null,1437411531,null,0,1437411804,0,ct9uzcm,null,t3_3dvr9x,null,t1_ct9uzcm,null,t1_ct9rznn,null,null,null,1438028186,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

Look, I get it.  I know that some people don't want Corbyn to be leader.  Some of their arguments against are very cogent, and we should be having a debate on them.  (For what it's worth, this piece looks like it's mostly built on begging the question, and avoids dealing with both the polling that suggests there is a lot of support for more-left-than-Ed policies outside of the immigration/benefits section, and also the fact that most of the immigration and benefits issues are to do with perception rather than policy.)

But carpet-bombing the subreddit with 'don't vote Corbyn because X' isn't exactly helping--it's implying all the other leadership candidates are utterly spotless by comparison, and that the reasons why we'd prefer them over Jeremy are so utterly obvious that it's not even worth insulting the subreddit's intelligence by pointing them out.

The key point is that even if your employer screws up and their computer issues you a new, wrong tax code, it is still fixable.  when the mistake is realised, you can send a letter to HMRC and have any excess tax refunded. It isn't a difficult process.

i didnt actually say that pls re-read

a great deal of people have to work outside 'office hours', many / most self employed people work huge hours with little / no holidays.

look, dont get me wrong, we all know it's a tough occupation and it should be financially rewarded appropriately, but many / most doctors/consultants earn considerably more than this. here's the first result on google for the search 'average consultant salary uk'

There are around 45,000 hospital consultants who are paid between £74,504 a year and £100,446 a year. Salaries for the UK's 42,000 GPs vary from an average of £103,000 a year for partners in practices to anything between £53,781 and £81,158 for GPs employed by Primary Care Trusts

so i think it is appropriate to request some clarification is it not?

you are correct that i did have the same, or equivalent educational opportunities as you, but it's a huge mistake to think that the equivalent level has been available to all our peers - there is a huge socio-economic divide when it comes to education, especially for the 'flagship' careers.

with this in mind, moaning about a salary of 50k isnt going to engender much sympathy and that was really the purpose of my post

I even went out of my way *twice* to show I didn't think they were the same ""his James McLean example isn't quite as severe as this but it's still the same logic."" and ""In a more extreme sense this logic would still hold true"" but you still insisted on claiming I was comparing the two examples as equals. Seriously, grow up. 


&gt; the rest of europe sees us as a bigoted, racist (and homophobic) irrelevant wee shithole


99% of that comes from the loyalist communities and political parties. You can't say not wanting to wear a poppy contributes to that.


&gt; ames's actions are more like playing in america and disrespecting their anthem and flag because of iraq


If you were an Iraqi who felt wronged by the American invasions, I would absolutely sympathise with not acknowledging the American flag (I can't believe you would compare the Iraq war to the Troubles I mean wtf /s) 


&gt; we as a populace have two choices. either we can persist with these petty little actions


I don't think you have a clue the cultural significance behind this, it's not petty. The people of Derry still hurt from Bloody Sunday and James would have serious trouble going back to those people after displaying his support for the army who inflicted it on them. That's not fair to demand that of James.


&gt; bridging the gaps,


By forcing someone to look at a flag?



You talk about all this divide but are outraged that this small gesture that James felt important, and no matter how nobly you decided not to wear a poppy on the Falls you won't understand his point of view, so stop trying to demean it.

null,false,thedingoismybaby,cnty-uk,No luck catching them swans then?,null,"There are two main scenarios that happen.

1) Someone has just driven, whilst drunk, and parked up. The investigation is to reveal when/where/how they got there. Part of that is interviewing which needs to be done on record and arrest facilitates that.

2) A person, drunk, decides to sleep in their car until it ""wears off"". It is an offence to be ""drunk in charge"" of a car, that is to be drunk and in charge of the car such that you could drive it. There is a defence to this, however, that you had no intention of driving. How do you find out someone's intention? You ask them! To ask them you need to interview, so you arrest.

Arrest is not a punishment, it is not saying you are guilty, it is not saying you are a bad person. Arrest is a tool used to help an investigation proceed. Specifcally in these examples to allow a person to be interviewed, once sober, to account for their actions without having time to make up stories or alibis (e.g. arranging a friend to say they were going to pick them up). It also allows for an evidential breath test to be taken, which records officially if the person is too drunk to drive. This can then be used as evidence, if needed. Currently the only legal way to get an evidential breath test is to arrest someone and take them to a police station for that sample.

They would only be charged if the offence was proven on the balance of probabilities. To give you an example I've arrested someone in bed because their car outside had new damage, a witness said they were driving, and I suspected they had been drinking. I did not see them drive and, quite possibly, they hadn't driven. But I need to investigate. So I arrest, take a breath sample at the station (so I have the evidence if later proved was driving), interview to see what the driver says (do they admit it? Great, charge. Do they deny it? OK I need to find enough evidence to convince a court they were driving, if that is where the evidence leads the investigation).

The offence has been in place since 1988 without any real challenges on these grounds, aside from the meaning of ""in charge"" in various court cases. It could be, however, that I am simply not explaining the legal position well enough to ease your concerns.

Tell me, what is the use of our political system if, when one party gets in, the second party decides that the first party got it all right and decides not to oppose things that _contravene the party's entire point of existing_!?  Of _course_ the electorate are going to back the winning party right after an election where they voted them in!  That isn't at all good evidence of what they'll believe in 2020, because we haven't factored in changes of opinion, changes in circumstance, the argument from the Oppositio- oh wait, the Opposition _isn't arguing_, it's just _mindlessly_ agreeing because it thinks this is what the electorate will want from them.

Yes, voters want a cut-down benefit system _right now_ (assuming that they do, and that our research and the election aren't far off the mark here).  That does _NOT_ mean:

* The same voters will be voting in 2020;
* They'll feel the same way in 2020 even _if_ the Opposition doesn't do anything to argue against it (the economic situation will be different, possibly even people's priorities will be different);
* They'll be utterly resistant to arguments in the next _five_ years (remember that five years is actually a long time in politics: Labour turned an embarrassing defeat in 1992 to a landslide in 97 despite having lost its leader in 94--to which extent this was the Blair effect is an argument for the ages);
* They are utterly closed off to anything that isn't a whole-scale thrashing of people who are on benefits, including people who deserve them;
* They won't be affected personally by the next five years of austerity.

No, none of these is our golden path to victory.

&gt;Can I ask what your worries about going via A&amp;E are? As someone who has been down this route both professionally and personally I might be able to help?

Nothing really serious, I just really don't want to distress my family more than I have already done. A huge trigger or 'thing' that worsens my episodes is my fear of distressing my family and being more of a burden than I already feel I am. They all have really stressful lives. Since I was a kid I made it my life's mission to not add to that stress. When the whole police thing went down none of them said anything because it wasn't a huge deal to tjem. Because of our experiences with other people (cousins, friends, customers in our businesses) who have gotten caught up with the police for whatever reason, dealing with them is no big deal to us. However, over the last few days I've been stressing more than everyone combined over the situation because I made it get to that point and the guilt is killing me. I've always been the invisible one in my family who no one has ever worried about. If I go a&amp;e they're going to react to it like I'm on my deathbed or something and it's just too much. 

Also, whenever my dad worries he takes it out on my mum (not physically - just verbally) and I fear that happening. It's probably the biggest thing that's putting me off. The day after the whole police thing happened, me and my mum were in tears the entire day. I was in tears because, well, it's expected for the aftermath. She was in tears because of my dad telling her off for god knows what. She's the only who helped me get through it yet he somehow managed to find a reason to shout at her. It's nothing none of us can't handle, but the guilt of me causing that reaction from him consumes me. I fear him doing that again if I were to admit myself to a&amp;e in case I have to stay there or be there until late because either of those situations will result in him finding out.

I might just be overreacting. I dunno.  I'm just trying to avoid the worst.",null,0,null,1437413591,null,0,false,0,ct9we40,null,t3_3dxmtq,null,t1_ct9we40,null,t1_ct9r9jk,null,null,null,1438029320,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

And you ignored the fact that many doctors ARE working on their holidays as locums. Think logically. We are short on doctors. Yet we hear about doctors working as locums to keep services functioning. Hint. Doctors are working on their days off to make ends meet. 

Okay. A CONSULTANT? You are seriously mad to compare them. Let's take into account... 

4 years of high school education to get into medical school. Medical school 5 years. 2 years of Foundation Doctor, 7 Years of training. To get that 103,000 quid salary you need to work 19 years as a consultant. 

You don't get to be a consultant by mucking about. Put it this way. I do stitches. I do prescribing. I can diagnose a fracture. But it is the consultant who makes the surgical plan and who leads the surgery unless it is something where I am being given an opportunity to learn and even then he's standing by to guide me, assist me and indeed take over should I mess up. That's a FULL doctor. 

There is a huge socio-economic divide because a lot of people from poorer families do not force their kids to get an education. In the UK we have a phenomenal education system at our hands and often the case is a refusal to use it. Possibly because ""school is most uncool"". The difference was my parents would kill me if I didn't study, while my friends could muck about. 

I repeat. You are making the mistake of looking at the possible end state of a career and dumping more debt on the beginning state without looking at the collosal amount of work that goes into learning the art of medicine. 

The problem is you have bought into this notion that doctors are paid for not working. Not that doctors often work way beyond the limit of the EU working hours directive and that it's idiotic to do that to doctors since they do have patient's lives in their hands.

Having said that, I was in a similar position to you and can say with almost full certainty that I would not pass the test without driving lessons.

Quite.  But Abby's whole point, and something that's coming up a lot in this subreddit as well as outside, is that people are going straight to 'Corbyn _is_ unelectable', which isn't even a testable assertion.  Not even Corbyn supporters _know_ that Corbyn is electable.  The whole _point_ of this debate is that we're taking a risk with whichever candidate we support, because there's four and a bit years during which a whole lot of variables completely unrelated to whichever leader gets in can intervene.

&gt; Furthermore, as I've pointed out before, the likelihood that the election of either Kendall or Corbyn might well cause large numbers of people, including, perhaps, members of the PLP, to leave the party, is a valid part of the discussion. We can think that those people threatening to leave are evil, treacherous turncoats who (paradoxically) never should've been in the party in the first place, but also think that casting a vote to split the party is a bad idea, without fear of inconsistency.

But, surely, the voting system is set up such that the elected leader _must_ have some semblance of mandate from the electorate (in which case the flight of lots of people from the party can be seen in quite a dim light, IMO).

Daily? Just how often do you think this happens? There's tensions on the run up to the Twelfth but that's the only regular instances?

null,false,southerngangster,lfcflame,,null,"I'm excited to see how he progresses this season. I could go on for ages about his quality, but I'd like to nitpick somethings he needs to improve on.

First would be his finishing. 5 goals in the league is not good and per ESPNFC.com (best formatted player statistics I could find) he took 103 shots in getting those goals. That's a rate of 20 shots per goal. He isn't hitting the target much either, just 33% (34 shots on goal). A lot of that has to do with him shooting from distance, particularly from the left channel when he cuts in. I'd like to see him aggressively dribble into the box and get some shots off from there. He's one of the very best dribblers in the league and dare I say world. Penetrating the box also collapses the defense and frees of spots for others to run into. That would really help our overall game.

The next would be his passing creativity. Again, he is already very good creative player. His through balls from deep are fantastic. I would like to see him get a bit better at those little passes when he is confronted with a wall of defenders or completely surrounded. Those passes that seem impossible that the like of Iniesta, David Silva, and Messi make hundreds of times a year. Those players are at the highest level of play-making technique and intellect and I think Coutinho could get there as well. As a Brasil fan I know we could desperately use that as well. Another thing I've noticed is that often he uses his dribbling ability to open up space to make the simple pass. [As you can see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9_uAkByus#t=23s), he beats to Chelsea players with ease and gets into a dangerous position only to play a disappointing ball square. [Here is another example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9_uAkByus#t=1m9s). For him to reach the next level, a I think he needs to produce a few more seconds of magic.

Thirdly, I want him to show his quality consistently. Rarely, but on occasion he isn't as influential on play. In most games he plays he is the best on either team, but doesn't dominate like he could. I only bring it up because he has the ability to do so.

Lastly, this is not on him but I'd like to see him almost exclusively in the midfield. Let him wander and pick up the ball where he wants. We have plenty of natural wide players there's not need for him to play LW ^^^and ^^^cause ^^^Neymar ^^^plays ^^^there ^^^for ^^^Brasil . I worry about the game passing him by while he's out there. He's arguably our best player and he needs to be getting on the ball consistently. Hopefully he becomes more comfortable drifting right and even deeper to become less predictable. Him dropping deep to play as a ""number 8"" for period of time would free up our CMs and FBs to rampage forward. Occasionally doing this unexpectedly might prove effective if our opponents can't figure out a way to combat it quick enough.

Afterthought: This sort of comes hand-in-hand with my third point, but I hope he grows as a leader especially with Gerrard gone (and for Brasil as well!). We've seem him grow from a weak, timid, and curly-haired Brasilian to be on of the best players of the beautiful game in the world. He's one of my favorite players.

I love him and I love Liverpool Football Club. ",null,0,null,1437414509,null,0,1437422862,0,ct9x090,null,t3_3dyaud,null,t1_ct9x090,null,t3_3dyaud,null,null,null,1438029758,null,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11,null

Similarly with companies the 'customer' of most companies is their shareholders. In capitalist thinking this is fine because the shareholders should be the public which should provide them with the proper ethical and social motivations, but in the modern globalised economy most voting shareholders are institutional investors and other organisations whose single motive is return on investment and nothing else. There is no motivation to invest in the social fabric of the business or the social fabric of the country in which that business is based.

So we have a widening disconnect between shareholder value and social value. Companies will not pay people more because staff are basically disposable and the shareholders will not countenance any policy which reduces their ROI even if it results in better productivity and innovation in the long term.

Firstly, I think we all know Tim has the capacity to be a great leader and is a charismatic, likeable person. However many of those who supported Norman said they weren't confident in Tim's ability to manage the spotlight effectively, to organise his team, or his message. Only a few days after his victory and it seems clear that Tim's lack of leadership experience is posing an issue, having apparently not prepared for what should have been an entirely suspected line of questioning from the media.  How can Tim recapture the initiative, get on top of his message, and reconcile - in the media and the general public's eyes - his arguably illiberal (at least, going decidedly against the grain in terms of most self-professed liberals) personal views with his position as leader of the Lib Dems? I'm not questioning his right to hold personal beliefs, mind - just his media strategy.

null,false,dilont,null,null,null,"Okay, teacher here. Without knowing the kids involved, I'll give what advice I can but, as you can imagine, it's an inexact science.  

This is a horrible thing to happen to anyone, more scary because it's happening in the local area and even more so because it's the start of the summer holidays.  

The kids picking on your son are doing it, I'm gauging from what you've said, because each time they do they *almost* manage to push him into losing his temper.  It's a game, satisfying because it's like scratching at a scab, each time they're getting a reaction and each time they're pushing him towards the stage where he'll lose it. Unfortunately, it looks like this might happen soon. When he does (I know this play against all those childhood stories about stopping bullies with a punch) the bullying will probably continue and may escalate. I can suggest a couple of things. 

 Firstly, there's little you can do about these bullies' behaviour yourself: they aren't your children and unless you feel confident about speaking to their parents, you can only do what you can for your own child at your end.  The days where we merrily told our kids to punch the lights out of other kids are over - it'd be assault and, at thirteen, a serious matter.  So, he should do the opposite - he needs strategies to keep his temper: he could practise strong body language, making himself appear confident even if he's not feeling it inside.  Practise with him, get someone, preferably a male, to walk up and down, practise in a mirror.  I know this sounds stupid but your instinct is right -  he must try not to react to the taunting - and doing so on the cuff is hard!   Practise shrugging his shoulders and walking on as if he doesn't give a s##t.  

Not reacting at all to someone takes a lot of self-control but if he could carry it off it might well make a difference.  If they're not getting their buzz from his reaction they'll get bored, give up (and unfortunately probably move onto someone else).  Enrolling in martial arts classes, especially something like karate or kickboxing, is brilliant for self control (and also being seen in the kit locally wouldn't do any harm).  

Secondly, make sure he has a phone with him at all times, and that it's charged and handy in his pocket. If things really escalate ensure he knows he has a number he can call for help if needs be - even if it's just there to make him feel safe.  

Thirdly, are there activities he could take part in over the hols? Something that would take his mind off the bullying, give him a new interest and maybe allow him to make new friends?  However strong we are bullying takes its toll on self-esteem and making new friends 
will allow him to see the bullies in their proper perspective and increase his confidence when he sees them again. I can't recommend this enough. 

Lastly, when the holidays are over go back to the school.  They are right in that events that happen outside are out of their remit.  Once out of the school gates, children involved are then the responsibilty of their parents.  But if this is happening IN SCHOOL, then there ARE things they could do and should be doing.  Unfortunately, as with most things in life, it's the people who push who get what they want and schools often prefer to stick their necks in sand rather than act. 

I hope this has been helpful, sorry it's not a magic bullet to make the whole thing go away.  Bullying is a horrible thing but you sound like a loving caring parent, just hang in there!

Internationalism, the Green agenda, Civil liberties and Human Rights, how to build a strong economy AND a fair society, Europe, the need to create a state based on the powerful citizen not the strong state.

I am an American and a graduate from the University of Saint Andrews (2008-2012), and although I learned to truly appreciate the efforts and struggles of the Liberal Democrats in the coalition, I was very disappointed that the Coalition government abolished the Post Study Work Visa in an attempt to make it look like immigration was being curtailed. I would still be living, working and paying taxes in the UK if it were not for this policy. 
What did you and your party really think about this policy, and what do you think could replace it in the future? Potentially billions of pounds of tax revenue and economic activity were squandered by kicking non-EU students out following their degree.

Thank you for answering this, if you get a chance. The General Election was unfair, tragic and difficult to watch, and I think people are slowly waking up to the fact that the LibDems were absolutely key to a fair, moderate Britain.

Then they get to vote on which system they want instead, except that the options are so complicated that nobody can make an informed and reasoned choice. Want to stick with FPTP? Tough, you just voted against it, before we told you what an unholy mess you were getting instead.

It states that Nadhim Zahawi, the Conservative MP for Stratford-upon-Avon, has been buying crude at a very low price (between $12 to $30 per barrel) from ISIL terrorists and transporting it to Israel and European markets through Turkey and the Mediterranean Sea.

This so far has not been reported either as a fabrication, or as fact anywhere in the UK apart from on a small number of social media sites in very small areas.

It's a problem with ideology full stop. Be it religious, political or anything else. Some will always take it and use it as an excuse for doing things they want to do anyway.

If it was an issue with Islam specifically then we'd see FAR more attacks considering how many Muslims there are. 

If you genuinely want to tackle extremism you need to realise that the thread that links all these people is a mix of social exclusion, lack of hope and mental illness. All of these are hard problems with many causes that can't be fixed overnight though.

Basically, no.

Legislation states that you have to leave the money there until you're 55.

There *are* companies/providers out there who will claim 'early' access to your pension fund, but they are basically scams - not only will they likely charge you money for the service, you (in all likelihood) also won't actually see your fund because they'll keep it to themselves. And/or you will be charged horrific amounts of tax by HMRC (up to or in excess of 70% of what it's even worth) in addition to your fees and probably not getting the money anyway.

It's really not worth it.

I know it's frustrating and that you might need the money now, but paying into a pension is supposed to be for your end-of-life cover and that's why the law is as it is.

The most that will be in the SNP's next manifesto, as the article itself mentioned, is a promise to hold a referendum if there is ""material change"" which means something that causes a significant jump in support for independence. Well done to anyone who can read between those lines and realise it's a way to be able to hold an independence referendum during the next Scottish Parliament if the UK voted to leave the EU. This isn't something horrific, it's pretty sensible for a pro-independence party to include bearing in mind the EU referendum will only be around a few months after the Scottish Elections, otherwise it would be years before a possible manifesto backed independence vote by which time the ties to the EU will already be well on their way to being severed.

Also keep in mind that first this would have to be put in their manifesto to be voted on by the Scottish people at the election. This is literally how democracy works, if the people of Scotland don't like it they won't vote for it, if they think it's a sensible idea then they will and nothing else matters.

Osborne's policy, and the wider global Conservative movement's thinking, is to say that economic productivity is low because welfare-to-work programs and benefits are too generous. 

Essentially that workers are not properly motivated to work harder and get better paying jobs because they can get, in Conservative thinker's view, 'easy' money via welfare. To their minds this is why the recovery hasn't taken hold, treasury receipts are down and almost all new jobs being created are at the bottom end of the pay-scale - ergo this is why they were unable to meet their deficit reduction targets under the coalition.

The solution, in their view, is the removal of welfare-to-work policies and capping of benefits. This, they believe, will result in a more productive and motivated workforce. The result on the business end will be workers demanding and thereby receiving better paying jobs - which won't happen. Obviously they intend to remove the safety net without ensuring that business meets their pay objectives.

This same view is being expressed by Republicans in the US, Conservatives in Germany, and the UK - Osborne is blazing the trail.

It's quite sensible to worry when we lose our three best players. It's possible to lose your best players on FIFA and football manager and still do well, just as it is in real life. But it's very difficult.

I don't see how this is FIFA logic - it's just general football logic that losing your best players is NOT GOOD.

I wonder where the stance on this is in regards to motor homes or anything else with a purpose built bed in it. 

One of my mates even had a van with a double bed and a PS2 wired into it in the back - he *did* kip in the back of it after a night out *because* he was too drunk to drive it home (and of course, it was convenient). 

In doing so he was safe and bothered nobody. The idea that he was breaking the law because he *might* decide to drive it is laughable. By all means target drink drives - fuck those people - but the idea of prosecuting someone for sleeping in their vehicle (by far the safer course of action vs. trying to drive it whilst drunk) is daft.

Well, your wish is already granted. All three of the main series are concluding in the next month or so. There will be the *Four Doctors* crossover event and then a restart of all three lines (with new writing and art teams IIRC).  

&gt;comics which are (in the nicest way possible) terrible.

Well clearly everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Personally I found the Eleventh Doctor run to be consistantly interesting and imaginitive - far beyond my original expectations based on the first issue. I certainly have some gripes with it: up until last issue, they had basically done NOTHING with Jones' character and I was left wondering why he was there most of the time; and the last couple of issues have felt extremely rushed, now that they are wrapping the arc up. Otherwise I've been impressed.

The Twelfth Doctor has a had a couple of good moments - especially with the *Swords of Kali* arc, but nothing much to write home about otherwise.

The Tenth Doctor's recent *Weeping Angels of Mons*, however, was excellent I thought. I'd go so far as to say that it was the best use of the Angels since *Blink*. It did absolutely nothing original with them and did it fantastically well: atmosphere, pacing, character development all handled very well together with a genuinely emotional finale - so often the failing with comics as a medium.  

The Paternoster gang has had a couple of outings in comic format in DWM, of course, and I quite agree that it would be (and has been) a very good medium for them, and I would be surprised if we don't see more of them in this format in the future.  

At the moment, Titan have plans for miniseries for all of the Doctors - with the Eighth Doctor the next one to appear in the schedule, but I would quite expect a Paternoster miniseries at least to appear somewhere along the line too.

No use at all. Lucky that's not what's going on here even slightly, then...


&gt;“I am determined that we will fight this regressive bill line by line, word by word in committee,” [Burnham said]. 

&gt;Burnham said that as leader he would oppose the proposed limit on child tax credits to two children per family and that he would vote against the bill at third reading if the government did not make major changes to it during committee stage. 

So what Burnham's saying is that he accepts that the Welfare system could stand a few tweaks here and there, but he doesn't support what's in the government's bill. So he's going to amend it to buggery, and then vote against it if his amendments don't get their way.

You may or may not agree with this position, but it's a million miles from...

&gt;just mindlessly agreeing because it thinks this is what the electorate will want from them.

Personally, I can't see the point of an Opposition that just votes against everything ""because they're the Opposition"", losing every single vote because they don't have a majority.

null,false,joepo32,null,null,null,"&gt;Christ i know its not, just think that Man City were in awful form, Utd genuinely were shit on paper, Liverpool were shit on paper and Arsenal have Arsene. Now Utd are decent on paper, City have improved and may improve their mental capabilites now they are not labelled Defending Champions, Arsenal still have Arsene but could sign a few more class players (a la Cech) to improve them on and off the pitch and Liverpool are still Liverpool just a little bit better.

Who cares what United were on paper they still had a decent team and one of the top 5 goal keepers in the world. City had plenty of talent and very good defensively. Arsenal is full of talent and Arsene is still a decent manager. Yes teams are going to improve but we don't need to waste money on players that won't start. Our team is good enough to repeat.

&gt;We should have performed better against those clubs on the pitch, the results were a mixture of brilliant defensive tactics and the opponents not being good enough. 

So you are going to at least admit we played well defensively? We lost 4 games last season in all competition. Those top teams weren't terrible last season. And even if they add a few players that doesn't necessarily mean they are going to be any better. Players flop. We had a team last season that could have competed against the teams they are making now. It's why we won the league by so much. We only lost 3 games. We have a team that can compete with any team in the world. Over spending is not needed. If the right ones come up we will buy them if we can. But I understand why we are not spending like United Because we don't need too.

&gt;With signings why can't we add attacking brilliance into that mixture for next years results against the big lot. Without signings they have improved from the teams that nearly beat us to teams that really could.

Depends on who we can buy and what the cost is. We can't just go waste money. And Sure we can. We just need depth to give some players a rest so we don't have to slow down after midseason again. Which we have this season. Our main players can play big games and get some rest here and there. I think you are over concerning yourself on the players other teams are buying. We very much still have a team that is better than all of them. 

&gt;Didn't Burnley get 4 points against City and Real Socidad won 3points from 3 in 2015 against Barcelona? Stats dont quite paint the picture I'm obviously disastrously painting.

This disastrous picture you are painting is completely unreasonable. We didn't lose to any top opponent last season. Will the league be more difficult? Of course. But we have a team fully capable of the challenge. With or without spending millions upon millions. We don't need to spend like this rest of the teams. They are trying to catch up.

He does seem to be working on these things, there were a couple of FA cup goals late last season off runs ahead of the play but he can still do a lot better. Sterling missed a bunch of sitters from 6-10 yards out last season, but Coutinho was hardly ever even in a *position* to miss them despite playing in a similar role to Sterling.

Across the country, for a professional household - assuming a couple of kids, sometimes with another income - the median is around £44k. An MP's pay would put them in the top 20% in this bracket.

That's not what is being claimed we should do. All that is being claimed is that we should be prepared to challenge the public narrative where we believe the narrative flies in the face of reality and sense.

This doesn't mean agreeing wholesale to what the Tories are saying, and it doesn't mean just voting against everything for the sake of it. It means having a proper debate and discussion to try and convince people over to our side. If we believe the budget proposals on welfare are wrong, then we should stand against it and make the case to the public why we believe they are wrong. 

We can't just appease the Tory narrative and hope the public will choose to vote Labour over Tory, we have to actively and passionately challenge the points we disagree with, else the only narrative that will ever be accepted by the public is the Tory one.

Here we have just said we'd agree/abstain with the Tory proposals except with a few tweaks, even though as a party this welfare bill isn't what we actually want. We've made this decision without even having a proper debate or discussion on whether the bill should be agreed or abstained with..

An opposition's duty is to question the narrative that the government presents, not to reject it for the sake of rejecting, or to agree with it, just simply to call out and make the case of where we believe it is wrong.

null,false,9632,null,null,null,"Ok, thanks for being honest about what you're feeling. I'm going to address your last point first, about ""over reacting"". You're not. I can only go from what you've described, but what you've told me seems like you're taking the steps you can to avoid things deteriorating and ending up with problems because of it. It's easier to help, from a medical perspective, if someone has approached you before they've got into a terrible situation, so it's good that you've identified this could happen and have chosen to take steps to avoid it.

I can understand your concern about your family. But in the long run our family just want to help you and see you get better. A&amp;E is simply the best way to get access to the help you need. Your family may not find out (could I ask what age you are?), as they may decide to have your appointments outside of the hospital at a separate centre.

I struggled with telling my family when I was in A&amp;E with serious mental health issues. I found it easier to ask someone else to talk to them before they saw me (either a nurse, doctor, or someone from Liason Psych team). They will be able to keep calm and explain how being in A&amp;E really isn't any different to seeing a psychiatrist anywhere else in this instance. The Liason Psych team in particular will be experienced in dealing with worried families. If you're worried about your dad's reaction, I would mention this specifically. The nurse (or whoever) may be able to say things like ""it's important to not attribute blame for this"" etc, hopefully preemptively avoiding the reaction you described. You could even ask them to bring it up explicitly as a source of your worry, and they can emphasise that that sort of reaction from your dad is only going to make things harder. This is of course fully at your discretion.

People can act negatively in times of stress, its important to remember that even if they do it doesn't mean they don't care, and in the long run they just want to see you get better. If it's explained to them that going to A&amp;E was suggested as the best route to you getting help, hopefully they will understand. If not now, then in the near future when things have settled down.

All this being said, I really do think you're doing the right thing making sure you get the help you need. And I do think going via A&amp;E is the quickest way to do this. Having been there myself, and recently had a friend go through a very similar experience, I know how hard this is but for me and for her it did get better and I sincerely hope it does for you too.

Also look into the exceptional circumstances rule which says that if being found fit for work would be a risk to your health or well being then you should not be found fit for work.

In the tribunal you will have a medical assessor and a judge and there they tend to do a much more thorough job!

I work in the local CAB and I would highly recommend going down ASAP. You have to remember that they are all volunteers but the Advice Session Supervisor will always be looking through what is going on and will be on the ball. They will help you formalise your appeal in the context of the expanded criteria (what is written on the assessment sheets doesn't completely match their marked criteria - see the disability rights handbook 2015 edition if you can find it). 

Likely they will know who could go with you for representation if you need it and would probably be able to send an advocate to give you a pep talk before you go in, make sure everything is done by the book and a bit of moral support. At the very least a second opinion is always nice.

On that note, I hate the system that is in place, guilty until proven innocent pretty much. The amount of people who would want to 'scrounge' on ESA all of their lives is very small. Most disabled people don't want to be on ESA! 

They must be losing much, much more money on the private medical assessments and then tribunals which take place, judges aren't cheap and all the centres are staffed with G4S security.

null,false,teafaceisming,eu,Derby,null,"To give you insight on how the process in my local CAB works, client comes to the reception, they see the gateway assessor that day, usually within 1-3 hours. It is first come first serve. The assessor takes all of your information and speaks to the Advice Session Supervisor. 

Depending on the situation and what ticket you have will decide how long the appointment will be. You might be given the information you need to do it yourself or signposted to an organisation specialised with what you require there and then.

 If someone is Homeless or has no income or is about to be evicted you will be seen that day or at least given a food voucher and told where to go if it is simply physically impossible to fit you in. 

If you have a deadline we will try to fit you in good time before the hand in date. If it is a welfare sanction or appeal or anything like that there will also be quite a priority given and at least in Derby an advocacy project that deals only with clients with health conditions that need more basic help.

With utility arguments, consumer disputes things like that it will often be assessed how capable you are of sorting out the issues yourself. Health conditions, language barriers, literacy issues often are the decidors. Or if the case is quite complex and you genuinely require help.

Similarly most CABs have internal services like a Debt Management team, some form of Employment support and maybe local legal bodies giving limited free advice on specialised subjects like eviction or immigration which may very well be able to get you an appointment very quickly.

It is also worth noting that benefits changes have really upped the footfall in CABs. They are inundated with sanctions, EEA citizens hit by habitual residency laws and tax problems, because getting rid of the tax offices without having a decent call centre structure in place was a bad idea. Whereas CAB funding has fell and students and older volunteers are more often than not working or in work placements or struggling themselves with the job centre etc. The shift for all benefits moving online has had a big impact because soooo many people are computer illiterate and Councils and Job Centres give 0 help on site with computers. Seriously it is mad. It is expected that Universal Credit will draw everyone out as then everyones benefits will shift over and they will have to deal with online claims. Legal Aid also was a massive hit and most people simply can't afford legal advice/representation and they see the CAB as the next best thing.

TL;DR the CAB is under so much stress at the moment and things are just getting worst. However if you have an emergency you will most likely be seen on the day, helped or squeezed in ASAP. If you have a minor consumer issue or no mental health etc. that might impede you then it may take longer.

There have been [three](http://www.fabians.org.uk/the-mountain-to-climb/) [major](http://touchstoneblog.org.uk/2015/05/the-tucs-election-post-mortem-poll/) [studies](http://www.scribd.com/doc/271940748/Listening-to-Labour-s-Lost-Labour-Voters-bbm-Research-July-2015) since the general election into our most recent defeat and all suggest the same thing: We need to move *on*, not back to the '80s with Corbyn or back to Miliband with Burnham; we need to win lots of votes from the Tories; and we need to address people's concerns about economic credibility, welfare and immigration.

You can tell me all about Blair and his 5,000,000, but that was fourteen years ago. Furthermore, people citing that fact never go on to tell me:

1. Who exactly they were
1. What reasons, if any, they gave for stopping voting
1. Where they went
1. If they stayed away forever
1. What, if anything, they say might win them back

Instead, I always hear that we 'abandoned our base' and that this means we need to 'move left'. Both of these may be true, but I have not seen *the evidence*.

Note that even if it was true that we had 'abandoned our base', it does not follow that we *can* win them back or that this is how we win elections and help the people we are supposed to help: The poorest.

Even if you present me with compelling evidence of all the above (and if you know where it is, please do), that was, I say again, an election 14 years ago. So, what I really need to see, and also never have seen, is any study of any kind that suggests that 'going left' is a good idea *now*.

Additionally, there's plenty in Corbyn's pitch which goes directly against the findings of the studies that have been done (he thinks that immigration just isn't a problem, for example, which may well be true but does not chime with the beliefs of many, including, by the way, 'our base').

So, insofar as you have an argument at all here, it's a very poor one. You've got very little to back it up apart from conjecture about why people left Blair and about just how many people think we're the same as the Tories, and more conjecture about how that affects the vote of either group (if at all), and whether going left would win the vote of either group.

In addition, you claim in one breath that 'it's *all* conjecture and unprovable' (my emphasis) and in another that your opponents' argument 'flies in the face of opinion polling', which implies that your side *doesn't* fly in the face of opinion polling. This is a very confused argument, as you don't seem sure whether you're making a plea for calm or insulting the other side. Also, as I have demonstrated above, the evidence suggests that you're wrong.

As for your characterisation of the other candidates' arguments, it is, again, simply false. They have been notably quiet about attacking Corbyn and have been setting out their own arguments fairly consistently, with most of them making a couple of major policy speeches a week. Not one of them has 'blamed Jeremy Corbyn' (publicly, anyway) for anything. That they have failed (which I accept) to get their ideas across is actually irrelevant to the quality of Corbyn's ideas, in that he is still wrong however uncharismatic his opponents may be.

But that's exactly what every extremist would say... It's not like terrorists aren't aware of the law, they simply think that their view their ""morality"" is higher and gives them the right to violate laws. Sure, Occupy is far from being Al-Qaida but Europe does have a history of left wing terrorism. E.g. the whole RAF movement actually started out pretty similarly to the Occupy movement with students protesting against bankers and big firms and relatively minor violations of laws. Then someone started with ""it's okay, as long as nobody gets hurt"", then people got hurt, then it ended in full scale terrorism.

So the police putting Occupy in a terror presentation is a problem but Occupy breaking laws isn't? Also this article is from The Guardian, so it's probably taken out of context or at least they are intentionally making the police look bad just because that's the political agenda of the newspaper. E.g. on the slide it says ""terrorism **and** domestic issues"". Not equals. The police even explains that:

null,false,Patch86UK,,Labour Member,null,"&gt;Here we have just said we'd agree/abstain with the Tory proposals except with a few tweaks, even though as a party this welfare bill isn't what we actually want.

For the love of all that is holy, no we haven't.

Burnham has said that we will raise a detailed amendment (or set of amendments) outlining *exactly* what the Labour Party thinks, and we will debate it ""line for line"", and that if we don't get our way we will vote against it.

I just flat out don't understand why nominally Labour supporting people are so absolutely tooth-and-nail desperate to find a reason to criticise the PLP. It's like we have a fetish for calling ourselves shit, and need to start inventing reasons for it when no other reasons exist. Burnham has said he opposes it. He says he plans on debating it practically to death at committee stage. He says that if Labour don't get their way, we're going to oppose it at the third reading (the one that actually matters). He says that Harman's stance on abstaining at second reading (this one) isn't the approach he would have taken, but there's no point rebelling on it if we're going to do all that with amendments/third reading anyway. He's said this is because of his stance on rebelling/cabinet collective responsibility, rather than his stance on abstaining (which he has already made public).

&gt;We can't just appease the Tory narrative and hope the public will choose to vote Labour over Tory, we have to actively and passionately challenge the points we disagree with, else the only narrative that will ever be accepted by the public is the Tory one.

If you want is someone to set out an alternative narrative, that's exactly what Burnham is doing- using the legislative process to put in black and white what Labour's views on this are (via amendments), and either get them implemented (because the Tories are desperate for our support) of have them voted down in a blaze of glory.

It says minimum payment each month would be £500. So in 4 months you would reach £2000 and then get no interest. 3 months if counting interest, which is paid monthly.

So is the ""trick"" to let it build up for 3 months, accumulate £45 (5% on 1500) then take it out to start again?

Here are the facts stripped of emotive language, confusing placement of events, a giant picture of IDS looking like an evil vampire, and play-to-the-gallery irrelevant information, so, chronologically:

* A man from Cardiff, David O'Mar was in receipt of disability benefits, specifically the article mentions housing benefit and employment support allowance. 
* Prior to falling ill  his housing benefit was reduced, and he then was found to have a limited capability for work in March, causing his ESA to be stopped from April 1. He appealed this second decision attempting to restore his  ESA. A tribunal date was set for this appeal.
* The article doesn't mention what his existing disability was, besides diabetes, which can vary in severity.
* David contracted pneumonia and was severely ill in hospital before and during the day of the tribunal, causing him not to attend. His daughter had previously written to the court to postphone the hearing, although the article doesn't say when she did this.
* The tribunal did not find any grounds for his appeal and thus his ESA remained stopped.
* David recovered enough to return home where his mother cared for him. Within a week however he deteriorated further and died on April 29th. Confusingly, the article states he died two weeks after losing his ESA, however in the same section says he died on April 29th.
* A DWP spokesman said: “Our thoughts are with Mr O’Mar’s family. It’s wrong to suggest a causal link between the death of an individual and their benefit claim.

In memoriam. David was a good person according to his family and did a lot of volunteer work for charity.

Absolutely not, that would be fucking insane. It's a funeral, and really the majority of those people were just wearing face scarfs and berets. 

&gt;Dozens of people wearing military-style uniform, berets and dark glasses attended the funeral in Londonderry.

From the BBC website. It wasn't even a known paramilitary uniform, it was just vaguely similar. That's not illegal. And aside from it being a funeral, the PSNI know themselves it would just be a disaster to potentially start a gunfight within a crowd. They're playing it safe, and biding their time, which in my opinion is the correct course of action.

At the end of the day, yes it's a scary thing to happen in this day and age. Ultimately there was very little the pissnee could do, so they're doing what they can now.

Bearing in mind that urgent means 2 weeks and emergency is a few days, so if you are actively delusional, psychotic or suicidal you need to go to A&amp;E. A&amp;E will always be a safe place for you. Very rarely are people sectioned from A&amp;E and if they are its for the best. However, if you haven't seen the gp go and explain your situation and your fears. The GP can liaise with the mental health team and see if they can expedite the process without the long wait, anxiety and disjointed process that emergency situations add.

Very sadly mental health is underfunded and that's why you are waiting. There aren't enough psychiatrists, counsellors and support workers. Those that I have met that work in the field are genuinely concerned for their patients and do their best to keep everyone safe. 
Express your fears in a truthful way to a doctor. Someone will help you. It sounds like you need it to me. Best of luck.

I think the owners are honestly willing to be patient with him as long as we place 5th or above, AND play attractive and attacking football. Last year was shit, but the year before that we played some awesome and fluid football (while some or most of that was because of Suarez, Rodgers still thoroughly deserves credit for the role he played in the success we had that year). I think the owners expect that type of football to be played, and believe that Rodgers is capable of providing that. That's why they didn't fire him this season, despite all the backlash at the end of last season.

Explain what has happened, how you received it broken and seller is being uncooperative. It might be worth putting up a copy of the receipt of postage too (worth a shot to try and recuperate postage costs).

Another thing, it might be worth phoning eBay themselves.

No, [68% of **42%**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Alternative_Vote_referendum,_2011) of the electorate voted to keep FPTP **in favour of AV**. 

&gt;A tiny number of people voting for a stupid reason doesn't invalidate the result.

No, it shows that the electorate would rather keep FPTP than reform to AV. It doesn't show that the electorate prefers FPTP.

&gt;I spent a lot of time following the AV referendum. It took up a lot of time, effort and money for a lot of people, and the people said no. Decisively.

No, 68% of 42% of the electorate said no. That's an abysmal voter turnout which was *probably* caused by being given a choice between two practically identical voting systems.

&gt;The electoral reform side don't get to just write that off just because they lost and would have prefered the referendum to have been on a different subject.

Yes, because the electoral reform side wanted PR and they were given multiple-choice-FPTP. Do you really think a voting system referendum would be exactly the same if the voting systems offered were actually different?

Unless you have a source. 

Many people would probably agree that the party with the most votes should have the most control, and there are a lot of people in the UK that do not like coalitions. They just want the spread of MPs in the opposition to better reflect the outcome of the popular vote.

Basically, I agree with the idea for a referendum, but would prefer to sign a petition that does not pre-suppose the result of that referendum.

null,false,nmcconville,null,null,null,"The country voted to keep FPTP over AV+ ([as per the question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Alternative_Vote_referendum,_2011)).

With regard to AV+, Nick Clegg himself described it as a ""miserable little compromise"". I don't think anyone seriously wanted AV+ aside from a platform for transitioning to a different, more proportional system. All I truly know is that it lost, I don't know 'why' it lost.

With the outcome of the recent election, attitudes may have shifted (of course, they may have not).

Using a NZ style approach then the electorate would be able to definitively reject or accept FPTP. 

I see one of the silver bullets to the shifting away from this voting system is the inability to agree upon the final system - STV being too complicated was recently provided as a reason to omit Amendment 47 from the Cities and Local Government Devolution Bill, for example. That settled that, apparently. I like STV, but I accept that it has drawbacks when considering something like - say, the constituent-representative link. However, I don't think it makes sense that we have a PR six-shooter loaded with referenda for every system. I would prefer a systematic approach towards PR, where different systems could actually be debated.  

Time, effort, and money will be spent on a multitude of issues, we could have referenda on other issues, and we could fund other things as well. Prioritization is a complex task considering the plate of issues that exist. David Mitchell put this point across quite bluntly when he was criticizing the over-the-top No2AV campaign posters.

I don't think it would be anti-democratic, the NZ approach would be asking a different question, not necessarily disrespecting a previously asked one. If there is a significant (if you can define it) demand for something like this then why shouldn't it happen again? Attitudes aren't set in stone and while it may be premature for another referendum on this issue, this is no reason to keep campaigning for another referendum on the matter later.

What I do know is that FPTP is an unfair, unrepresentative system. It is inadequate to represent nationally held views.
It continues to satisfy [Duverger's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law) - as Lord Ashdown said on Question Time, [the coalitions are within the parties](https://youtu.be/59FBKeR3_NE?t=453).

For scary things: you can use the fact that she can not see a monster, she can't beat a weeping angel which can scare the spectators. But she can hear them come and she is good at not fearing not-seeing as a reason to avoid putting a fight while the Doctor or another companion would freak out about it she would just pick her cane and fight back!

For comedy: well from being able to smell a time lord to hear the doctor talking to the tardis in another room..etc

For leaving the viewers thinking: she can't see a dalek or a monsters look which probably could make her see them from another perspective she can't even tell if there is any difference between a time lord or an human or a monster based on looks too(she called him ""her monster"" after all), her character could be used  to show kids that just because you can't see something/hear/etc doesn't mean that you can't get adventures and to teach them some daily things that are taken for granted (like being able to watch the show).

And in other things: She could also learn to fly the TARDIS even without sight, she could do cane-fencing, she could keep track of historic facts and dates and she already knows what lying can do since her mother lied to her and that gives her a skill to understand what others companions always fail to do so: ""the doctor lies"".

Secondly, FPTP means that those parties with small numbers of voters are entirely irrelevant and voiceless, considered as a ""wasted vote"", whereas under the Kiwi brand of PR they get a seat or a few, and may even get to be a small influence on government.  Taking the Kiwi Greens by way of contrast, the 10.7% of the Kiwi populace who voted for the Greens were rewarded with 14 seats out of a 121 seat house, a representation of 11.5%.

Yet you don't question the democratic nature of offering a choice between a plurality system and another plurality system and then wondering why the reformists didn't show up to vote?

&gt;The electoral reform side lost, and so they deserve to be punished. No referendums for them for the foreseeable future.

Wow. Yes, let's punish the reformists for the Tories giving them a choice between the same shit and the same shit but with a few sprinkles here and there. ""Hey guys, yeah, we won that fair and square, now fuck off because you OBVIOUSLY LOST IN WHAT YOU TOTALLY WANTED TO DO"".

It's an odd scenario. In the developed countries our 'real' problems are relatively minor - we have every essential humans need to survive and even those of us living in what we currently define as 'poverty' live far better lives than even just the last couple of generations did.

And yet mental health issues are seemingly increasing. So many of the people I know closely suffer from anxiety and depression and, for those of us who do suffer, life can become a horrible experience. Mental illness is almost like a scar we carry under our clothes that has to remain hidden and which is usually only to be revealed to those of us who carry the same marks.

I often wonder why mental health issues are on the rise and I've come to the conclusion that it's mainly due to the 21st century, materialistic, always on world we live in today. There is now so much pressure on individuals to conform that it's almost crippling us. We can never switch off and our lives are permanently catalogued online on sites like Facebook. We're permanently up for judgement.

At work, the introduction of email has meant that jobs now arrive instantly and it's easy to become over-faced. We also spend large swathes of our time sat at computers and trapped in air conditioned offices.

Finally, many of us do not see the actual fruits of our labour. We see no material reward for our efforts other than our pay packet and, consequently, we view our success on how large that pay packet is, sometimes chucking away our more human elements in its pursuit. 

In light of those facts, it's understandable that many of us struggle. We just can't fit the mould that society expects us to. I sometimes wonder if we're actually mentally ill, or we're perhaps quite rational in seeing the world through the lens we do.

This has been a bit of a rant, so I'll close it with two quotes, one is one of the more powerful lyrics I've heard, and which I think of whenever I see those around me living their life to climb the greasy pole, and the other is from Con Air of all things (and spoken by a serial killer!).

*'It's like we weren't made for this world, though I wouldn't really want to meet someone who was.'*

*'What if I told you insane was working a 50-hour week for 50 years, at the end of which they tell you to piss off. Ending up in some retirement village, hoping to die rather than suffering the indignity of trying to make it to the toilet on time. Wouldn't you consider that to be insane?'*

I recently moved from the Netherlands to the UK (Scotland), and while I can't say anything about moving from the UK to another country, I can tell you a bit about moving to a different country in general.

For me, the language is no problem. In the Netherlands most people speak English (apart from the elderly, maybe). I have some friends from Scandinavia and Germany and in general their English is very good. 

In normal day-to-day life in the countries you mentioned you will be able to manage with just English. However, some jobs might require fluency in Dutch/German/Swedish/whatever. So if you're serious about moving, try to start learning the language. There are loads of apps and websites with free content to start learning a language.

Obviously I don't know what field you're in, it might well be that business in this field is mostly conducted in English, even abroad, anyway. And if not, then there will always be jobs for English speakers, for instance in tourism, customer service, or the service industry (e.g. pubs). Jobs for English speakers might be easier to find in larger (touristy) cities. 

In my case, I moved before I had a job. I had money saved up so this was no problem. If you want to do it this way, make sure you have enough money saved up. Do some research on rent prices in different areas, and cost of living. Don't forget things like transport, and look into things like health insurance. In the Netherlands, this is compulsory, and you'll either be paying monthly or for a few/6/12 months in advance. If you decide to move before finding a job, do consider a worst-case scenario (e.g. being unable to find a job within x amount of time, having to move back to the UK), and make sure that even in the worst-case scenario you can support yourself or move back to the UK if necessary.

Without knowing what sector you're in, it's difficult to tell you how to find a job. I know that for some fields, there are jobsites which advertise jobs in the UK as well as in the rest of Europe. Try to find out if there's such a website. Otherwise, just try googling around. A quick Google of 'looking for job in EU' led me to [this website](https://www.eurojobs.com/) (Disclaimer: no idea if it's any good, did not look at it). There must be more websites like this around. Maybe [this website](http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/finding-job-abroad/index_en.htm) has some good tips?

As for settling in, in my personal experience this was not so difficult as I moved in with my boyfriend, who is from the country I moved to. If you're on your own, and you don't know anyone in the country you're moving to, be prepared to do a lot of research before you move, and also when you've moved. A simple thing as where to buy certain products can be quite difficult in a new country. I mean, H&amp;M and fastfood restaurants are the same everywhere, but if you need to buy towels or bedsheets then you might need to wander around for a bit to find out where to get these things. (Of course, amazon is always an option :P)

In my experience, it's these little things that can be quite frustrating or stressful. Not knowing where to find certain information, where to buy X, or who to contact about Y can get tiring. Good thing many countries have their own subreddits where you can ask your questions ;)

As for making friends, I think it's similar to making friends in any new place: try joining clubs/societies/organisations to meet people who have the same interests. You'll meet people at work as well. As a student, I had loads of international friends. Again though, this might be easier in a larger (student?) city. It's not required that you speak the local language, but it's probably easier when you do. People are hardly ever as confident in expressing themselves in their second language than in their first, and they might switch over to their first language to talk to the rest of the group, which may make you feel left out. I guess taking a language class would also be a good place to get to know people!

I've already made this post *wayyyy* too long. If you have any more questions or even questions specifically about the Netherlands, let me know! You can send me a pm if you want :)

&gt; 'a small period of the status quo until the other side find a different voting system they like to trigger another referendum'

In my comment I advocate against this, the NZ approach does not directly advocate for this. It is about rejection of a broken system.

Punished is probably a bit harsh. And what is 'the foreseeable future'? Is it the next government after this? Do we have a 'metarendum' to decide if it's worth tabling? Will it be a decade, in 2021? Or should we wait another [80 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_reform#United_Kingdom)?

They always try and stick their nose into kid's business outside of school, unless it's something actually important. If you are got in a fight outside of school wearing the school uniform or riding your bike without a helmet they'd be on you like a ton of fucking bricks, but bullying? Outside of our remit, sorry.

It's fucked. And I'm sorry for the rant, but it's bad enough that we've stripped away the ability for individuals to do anything for themselves but the people we are forced to hand that power to are far worse.

And the advice you gave is probably good concerning how it is, but in my experience the whole 'take it on the chin and don't give them a reaction' approach earns just as many laughs and the kid becomes a punchbag because everyone knows they can take the piss out of him and he's not gonna do anything apart from that thing where he pretends to laugh along with it and walk off like he always does.

I can't speak for others, but if an *actual PR system* lost to FPTP, I would accept that.

if you want a good, authentic place for chinese food in general i'd go with Imperial Palace if you don't mind the distance/price. Probably closest one here to the Manchurian. 

Saigon Saigon is halfway decent for dimsum and is cheaper, just off Prince's street across from the McD's/KFC. 

If you're at the UoE, there's a place called Lian Pu just east of Potter row/George Square that can get you by in a pinch, their 红烧肉 is pretty good. 

I'll second Tasty Noodle, their dumplings are great but noodles are handmade by the owner who's a nice guy. Reaally tiny place, and just behind Buccleuch, again close if you're at UoE. 

Good luck and see what you like! Plenty of great suggestions here.

So first off work out how much you'll be comfortable on, ie necessary essentials, etc. If your rent is 400, I imagine you'll spend the same on other expenses. At least that's my experience. But play with it for a couple of months until you are sure. 

Next step is indeed to work out what employer match you can get on your pension. Mine do 3/5ths of my contribution, up to 5%. Which is shitty, especially for my industry. Then contribute the max you can get matched. So in my case, 5%.

Take that off your outgoings as well when calculating your expenses. 

Then you're going to automate your finances. What this means is paying your bills by direct debit, a few days after your paycheck comes in; and setting up an ISA and probably a couple of other savings accounts. For accounts other than my emergency fund, I prefer to do this at a separate bank from my current account. It slows down any transfer of funds and makes me think before wasting it. 

The savings accounts are going to be for goals you want. In my case, this means a holiday fund and an emergencies fund. The emergencies fund is at 3 months expenses at the moment. The holiday one has been recently depleted but is still healthy. 

Work out how much your holidays are going to cost (literally just guess, the amount doesn't really matter) break this down into 12 chunks and add a direct debit from your current account (where your salary gets paid) to the savings one. Do the same for the emergency fund and set a target of 3 months expenses then cancel the direct debit once it's been topped up. These should come out about 5 days after you get paid (e.g. I get paid on the 29th, and these are set for the 3rd). Oh, and when it comes to paying for your holiday, **actually use the savings**. That's why they're there.

For your ISA, do the same. How you set this up is different, and I will leave it up to you how to invest, and just say that the only way to become rich in the sense of not having to worry is through investing. I like index funds, and at the moment I suggest not investing in the FTSE, it's going crazy with Greece doing its thing. 

Finally, assuming you are debt free, get a credit card with good rewards that you will actually use (I have a Lloyds Amex/Mastercard combo which gives me avios, which I use on flights because I like holidays - you may prefer cash back, shopping vouchers, who knows!). Now the main thing, pay it off in full each month, every month, without fail or arguing or anything else. Set up a direct debit. Seriously, paying interest for one month will wipe out most of your rewards. Spend only the amount you have left after savings, bills, etc.

Perhaps what would help is if I present the correct situation:

1)By approaching the junction slower the Lorry driver would have time to asses the access point to the road and would require a much smaller turning circle.

2) As he begins to turn he should notice the motorbike heading down the road - the motorbike should be clearly visible (It is bright white), travelling slowly and is on the correct side of the road.

3) The lorry should at all times during this manoeuvre be prepared to stop.

4) With a reduced turning circle and slower speed the lorry driver would have been much less on to the far side of the road, enabling the motorbike to position himself closer to the curb, and the lorry to complete the manoeuvre, ending it with a courteous wave.

- China grew faster than the UK in 2014 but it remains classified as a 'developing' economy despite being four times larger than the UK economy. 7.4% growth.

- India also grew faster than the UK but, despite being a top 10 global economy, is not classified by the IMF as a 'major' economy. 5.4% growth.

- Productivity remains lower than 2007, unprecedented since the war.

- The growth we're seeing is mainly down to cheap labour driven by migration and stalled wage growth. 

- Unemployment is falling overall but the new jobs are at the very bottom end of the pay-scale. 

- US growth is forecast at 3.1% this year, and will certainly overtake the UK, just as it has in the past.

- Our [Real GDP growth](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?order=wbapi_data_value_2014+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=desc) rate is 3.20 or 97th in the world. India and China are at 7.4, and we're being outpaced by Ecuador and Malaysia. 

- We are not even in the top [20 fastest growing economies](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-25/the-20-fastest-growing-economies-this-year) worldwide. We're being beaten by Poland!

- And we're not even the fastest growing G20 nation, but we are the fastest growing G7 nation for 2014 alone.

- Our [global competitiveness](http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-competitiveness-report-2014-2015) ranking is woeful, we don't even make the innovation list.

We aren't a international success story though. The debt is three times larger than it was when labour left office (and that's with very low interest on the debts) and a supposedly massively small deficit. There is a widening gap between the poor and the rich. Youth unemployment is still a huge issue with many youths being burdened with 40-50k of debt. Our welfare system has been ripped apart and forces many people into poverty - hundreds of people have likely died as a result of having their benefits removed. We have a public service critically underfunded than is starting to collapse and is stretched too far and can't cope. We also having a housing bubble that will likely pop quite soon. Poverty is rising, especially child poverty (rose for five years straight). We also have an education system going through completely unnecessary reforms that will severely cripple the system. Many public services are being sold off - even those turning a profit. How are we a success story? We are becoming like corporate America.

He's like Agbonlahor for me - became a fan favourite but only because we were so desperate for one during the Lambert years and we all knew deep down that Tekkers was away. He went missing in games all the time, and I don't have his scoring record to hand but it's hardly the stuff of an elite CM. He's riding pure hype now and will be massively found out at City. I expect him to benched by autumn, never to be seen again.

There's no way he's irreplaceable, and I doubt his absence will affect the side in terms of quality, although you could argue psychologically he's a presence for the squad. To argue that though, you'd need to explain all those miserable results where he was captain and there was no passion or fire on the pitch. I'm thinking Hull, QPR (both times), Saints, Newcastle etc etc etc... I was going to say relegation-bound Fulham doing the double over us in 2013/14 but I forget if he was injured for that.

I'm not that bothered he's gone, and now I know his attitude is shit I feel much more vindicated in that opinion.

How did you come to this conclusion? I originally replied to a comment that specifically stated that Stones should be our number 1 objective *this transfer window* and since then I have been defending my point that while Stones would be great he should not be our top priority this window. Its very simple and no one seems to have really done anything to prove that as wrong.

&gt; but this has a good chance to be a fantastic buy for Chelsea.

I am NOT saying that this is false. But it does not make it a priority signing. I really have no idea why people are trying to make this into a debate.

Churchill was 66 when he became PM for the first time in 1940, and and 77 when he become PM for the second time in 1951, and by the time that term as PM ended in 1955 Churchill would be about 81. A comparable example is Clement Attlee, who was 62 when becoming PM in 1945 and 68 when his term as PM ended in 1951. Additionally, there was Harold Macmillan who was 69 at the time of stepping down from being PM in 1963. 

The point I'm trying to get across, is that even in the crazy times of the mid 20th century, when healthcare, nutrition and medical knowledge were no where near the standards they are now, we had many PMs who were comparable to Jeremy Corbyn's age. And with all the medical advancements, I'd say that they could even be a bit older. 

It's just that a change took place in our society whereby we expect our PMs to be much, much younger and more energetic. Personally I wish we'd return to the older style. It might give some of our prime ministerial candidates a chance to gain some much needed experience. At the moment they barely have time to get their degree from Oxbridge and become a parliamentary advisor before they get given a seat to contend. If we didn't start making them MPs so fast (and then front pagers, and then PMs) they might have a chance to actually do something. Churchill had a messy career as both a journalist and navy man before becoming an MP. Attlee as well was trained as a lawyer and didn't even enter politics in a significant way until after the First World War in his late thirties. The wealth of experience these people brought to their job was immense in comparison to what our PMs have now.

What is this sorcery?!

EDIT:  But in seriousness, our dealings have been great so far, but I think we still have a lot to do.  

Incoming:

*  With Stambo leaving, we need *2* defensively strong CMs, because Mason and Bentaleb don't offer enough defensive shielding as a pairing (they should both be more attacking box-to-box CMs, paired with a defensively capable partner).  And at least one of these needs to be a *veteran* presence (ie, not Alli).  I don't think Dembele what we need in this position, and I like him much more in the attacking midfield.
* We need another quality striker.  Not a ""backup"" striker, but one who can compete with Kane and who won't be a downgrade when Kane is rested or (heaven forfend) injured.  If both Ade and Soldado leave, we need a third striker too.
* We need a quality winger, preferably one who can play on either side.  Our attacking midfield situation is ... weird.  We need true cover/competition for Chadli, and I'm not yet convinced that either Lamela or Townsend is good enough to be our consistent starter at RW.  Either or both could kick on this season and be excellent, but that's a gamble.  And then there is the issue of fitting in Eriksen and Dembele, both of whom have been good and occasionally excellent at CAM.  I'd like to see Pritchard have some opportunities with the first team, but at whose expense?
* Sorry, no suggestions for incomings.  Not my forte, and honestly, I expect Mitchell and our scouting corps to bring in some players that most of us hadn't even thought of, but who will be almost exactly what we need.

Outgoing: 

* Chiriches, Adebayor.  I like Soldado as a third striker, he's decent in the Europa League, and he's a great ~~squad~~ clubhouse guy.  But if he finds a way to go back to Spain, I'd be happy for him to do so, for his sake.
* Lennon, and possibly another attacking midfielder, though I think the rest of them have a lot of potential and I think Pochettino does too.

Form:

* I don't see anyone regressing.  We actually have a bunch of talented players who have not been playing up to their potential, or who are still growing into their potential.  The only ones who really played to their potential last season were Kane, Lloris, and Rose, and I don't really see any of them ""regressing.""  Harry will need to make adjustments as league defenses start to adapt to him, but I am fully confident he will.  His ""football intelligence"" is outstanding.
* Improvements: Given what I just wrote above, I expect most of our players to improve.  Lamela, Vertonghen, and Bentaleb in particular could have massive seasons -- the latter two especially, due to better partnership situations.  I also hope Mason will improve with a more appropriate partner. 
* Best XI's are pretty meaningless at this juncture, with almost a month and a half of the transfer window left.

You can start with the reboot. However, there are many, many references to the Doctors past incarnactions, times, locations, monsters, etc. throughout.

&gt; What do you think of our dealings so far?

Smart, nothing too flashy but we've filled a few holes. It seems we are looking to fill some space with academy players as well.
&gt; What positions still need to be looked at?

Someone who can double as striker/LW would be ideal. I'm still skeptical on Chadli and we saw how Kane fatigued in the close of last season.
&gt; Do you have any realistic suggestions for those positions?

Knew a welsh bloke once. He'd be alright if I can remember the name...
&gt; Should we look to sell anyone else?

Wouldn't be opposed to Dembele leaving, but if he has something to prove next season he could be good.

Well here's an interesting point, the vote won 308 (apparently 22 Tory MPs were so against the welfare bill they defied their own party whip) to 124. Had the 184 Labour MPS who abstained instead voted against the bill, the result would have been

You may observe, this would have been draw, at which point the speaker would have to put their own vote in. Now as it's the first reading, he would have voted for continued discussion, so the government would still win, but the narrative would have been very different.

Imagine that, had Labour been an actual opposition, whilst the government would still get its bill passed, tomorrow morning we would be seeing headlines saying how Cameron is unable to control the majority of his house. The Conservatives would then start haemorrhaging support as the Tory narrative starts to fail.

I think Lamela, Eriksen will improve the most with a full round of pre-season and rest.  Lamela will build on his strong end-of-season run, Eriksen will have a decent back-up in Pritchard and hopefully stay fresh.

However, I don't think our Lord and Savior Harry Kane can keep up his 31-goal season two years in a row.  Teams are going to go over the season's tapes to ~~futilely~~ find a way to shut him down.

I find that whenever there is room for optimism at Spurs, it tends to somehow turn to shit and it's been nice flying under the radar. That being said, I am enjoying the new direction this club seems to be heading in and I'm excited for next season.

Our transfers have obviously been focused on strengthening our defense and I think Trippier, Wimmer and Alderweireld are all good signings. Alderweireld seems to be a first team buy while the other two will definitely offer stiff competition. Areas like defensive midfield could use some bolstering as I think Bentaleb would be immense if he had the cover behind him, the only thing is there aren't too many of them available. McCarthy would be my choice signing and I really like Sporting's Carvalho (Dier has also played with him IIRC?). 

An offensive signing would be the cherry on top, literally. Players like Chicharito, Berahino or Mirallas could all play as that wide-forward and be the firecracker we've been lacking in the final third. Everything being said, I imagine our starting lineup for next season to look like this (4-2-3-1):

---------------------------Kane

--New Signing?/Chadli - Eriksen - Lamela

-------------------Bentaleb - Dembele/Mason/New Signing?

-----------------Rose - Jan - Toby - Walker

--------------------------Lloris


In terms of player progression/regression, I think Kane will most almost definitely NOT put up another 30 goals. Therefore, the others will need to step up. I actually think we'll see a lot more from Bentaleb offensively. The kid has a great shot and his football IQ is only getting better, there's a reason why he got a good new contract. He just needs that bit of cover to get forward. But Chadli could easily step up and we all know what Eriksen is capable of. Hopefully these new young guns will offer something to the first team, I can totally see Pritchard getting a few games and he could definitely offer some cover for Eriksen (a player who was absolutely gassed by last March). Alli gets me excited too but I'm reserving my excitement as I'm almost positive he will get loaned out to a lower table or lower league side. League One to the Premiership isn't a transition to take lightly and I'd rather the club invest time into his development. 

All optimism aside, I think we'll finish 5th again next season and challenge for a trophy. I'd like it if we made it a little further in Europa, I know it's an unpopular opinion but I think Europa matters a lot, especially if we want to be back in the UCL. We need to be able to beat the big teams again. Chelsea and Arsenal were awesome wins last year but they'll both be better this season and we're going to need to step it up. That being said, we can't capitulate against teams like Stoke (Hughes is actually working wonders with them IMO) and that will ultimately come down to our offense having to learn how to unlock deep lying defenses. I think Jan and Toby will form a great partnership and help us plug some holes in the backline. Hugo is always a boss.

What regulations specifically does she think were nanny statish? The smoking ban? Who on either side would vote to repeal that? What else was there in the last Labour government?

Sure I'd like less government interference. I'd like them to stop fucking about with trade unions, people's freedom of speech, right ot privacy, people's right to assemble. I'd like more regulation on wages and conditions, on what an ""apprenticeship"" can be, on drugs (legalise and regulate), on how the secret services operate.

Without specifics it's just nonsense statements. ""Regulation is bad"" is the kind of simplistic statement you expect from the Tories, where we all know what kind of regulation they really mean (workers rights).

So I restate my opinion that it's image that she's after. ""Look at me! I say stuff the Tories say!"". This isn't the result of a great thought about what's wrong with our country, it's picking up from the tabloid list of complaints about Labour and running with it.

----at this point I spot the link below---

I've just read the full speech, and while it's not as bad as the article displays it, it's still pretty muddled. For example:

&gt;That was true even for the NHS. In 1948, Labour brought the patchwork of community and voluntary health provision under a national funding system, free at the point of use. 

So, centralisation was good?

&gt;But hospitals continued to be rooted in their communities, with local representatives on the board. 

Not sure this runs counter to a central strategy. Let's see what else she's got:

&gt;Our party was created to be the national voice for the workplace activists, community organisers and civic leaders who were fighting against poverty and injustice. It gave them a bigger platform, better funding, and the legal status to ensure what they created could make a bigger difference.

Ah, so again, centralisation was good and hey look! Regulation helped too!

&gt;It’s about how we are treated by the people around us, and the institutions and services we use. It’s about self-respect, dignity and a sense of control over our own lives. That feeling of control isn’t created by government alone. We won’t make Britain a more equal society if a small group of people in Whitehall have all the power and everyone else has none. Real control only comes when people can do things for themselves.

So, you *do* want government to influence how people act in their daily lives? Or you *don't* because it's not something in government's purview and therefore is irrelevant?

&gt;This morning, I visited Brixton Energy. Their strap-line is ‘power to, for and by the people’. Brixton Energy is a co-operative that generates cheap solar electricity and ploughs the profits back into the local area. Community energy doesn’t just generate electrical power. It creates people power: making sure residents have a stake and a say in an industry which all too often feels distant and out of control.

Hey! We could follow the model of the NHS and SureStart as you say! Why not take all these local power generation companies and help them join up nationally, maybe with a national brand and shared resources...oh wait.

Legalising sleeping in your car whilst drunk would open up all kinds of cans of worms. First and foremost is that you want to put as much seperation between people who've been drinking and their vehicles. Sleeping on the backseat might seem like a great idea when you roll out of the fox and chicken blind drunk at midnight, but when you wake up at three in the morning freezing cold with a stiff neck and busting for a pee, a lot of people are going to think ""sod this, I'm going home to my cozy warm bed instead"". Even if you do manage to sleep until a civilised hour, there's no gaurentee of sobriety, and again the choice between spending sunday morning sat around like a lemon in the pub carpark and go home for a fry up and a cuppa is going to put unsafe drivers on the road.

Then there's the issue of what's acceptable and what isn't. Let's say sleeping in the back seat is ok - what if you took your mate to the pub? Is he allowed to sleep in the front? What if there's four of you - can one sleep in the drivers seat? Can the driver sleep in the drivers seat? What if one of them is a named driver on the insurance? Can he sleep in the drivers seat? What if you're in a two seater? Can my wife and I sleep in her two seat car? Can we have the engine on to run the heater? Does it only apply to car parks, or can we sleep parked on the road? Can I move my car if I'm blocking someone in before I go to sleep? Can I move it from the carpark to the road?

&gt; Dealings so far: 

Good. Smart buys in the back. Besides Wimmer, the PL proven players are a good sign that we're not looking *just* for bargain players that may come good. Moving out players like Kaboul, Paulinho and Capoue has been brilliant pieces of business. Additionally the move of Stambouli surprised me but if the backroom staff see something I don't then moving him on is a good idea. 4/5. 

&gt; Positions to be looked at: 
    
- If anything, our left wing should be addressed. Unless Pitchard and Alli can move left, we are oddly weak in that area. I don't see Eriksen playing much out left anymore. If Adebayor does move up north to Birmingham, then a striker who is willing to play rotation will need to be bought. 4/5. If I was to ponder a replacement striker now, and considering our bargain mind-set, I am inclined to think Berahino is a decent fit if the fee isn't outrageous. He has shown he can do it in the PL, but isn't talented enough yet to demand starting 11. I'm strictly against foreign strikers coming in as the PL is just so much rougher. 

&gt; Sell anyone else:

- To be honest, if a team came in with a good fee for Lennon (assuming he isn't official at Everton this window), then I think it's time to move him on. I'd like to see us promote an academy player to play 3rd understudy behind the Lamela Townsend situation. My opinion and very unrealistic. 

**Players:**

&gt; XI

- Lloris, Walker, Dier/Alderweireld, Vert, Rose -- Lamela, Bentaleb, Dembele, Eriksen, Chadli -- Kane.  -- Preface this by saying I want to see how Toby and Vert play in PL before pushing him above Dier. I think Eric has some natural talent and it's only a matter of months of grooming him that it will pay off. I'm also skeptical on the Bentaleb/Dembele partnership, but I see Moussa as more experienced and more skillful than Mason. Neither are defensive but I trust Moussa to dribble himself out of trouble when caught deep. 

&gt; Improvement:

- Dier, Dier Dier. Also: Dier. Smart, has pace, doesn't allow too much behind him without it being tracked. As long as he isn't forced out wide (That's why we have Kieran, right?) then I see his development continually and knocking on the top spots door. I see a casually high fee for him coming in January or next summer if he continues to develop. Potential to knock Vert off his stoop in 18 months (assuming Vert isn't off by then anyways).
- I think you're going to see Bentaleb continue the same run of form, albeit he won't be as noticeable. Players know about him now and he will have to step up on his game. Nabil does the things nobody notices and then some. 
- I don't often expect much from youth academy in their first year-first-team outs, but I'm a little excited by Pritchard. I don't think he is going to have wonderkid status, but I do believe he is going to hold his own for 30 minutes against a lower league side. I expect him coming on to energize a game late. 

&gt; Regress:

- Kane: He won't do 30 again, but if he does I will be thoroughly clinching my butt cheeks for a foreign investment from the big clubs. Marketing marketing marketing. I think we will see a good 25 return at best from him this year. 
- Walker: My inclination is that Walker tries so bloody hard, that he should just get better, but he is just not a smart footballer. When you look at Rose' last two seasons, you saw the same amount of energy from him, but he was in the right place 70% more. Rose also saw an increase in late decision making, something he suffered from two campaigns ago. Kyle will be pushed this year to become a smarter footballer, not a more athletic one. See: Ivanovic. 
- Fazio: I reckon his time on the pitch decreases this year, maybe stays the same. I think he is a great defender against lower side PL clubs, but simply lacks pace against the speed-merchants that sit with the top four. I expect he drops behind Wimmer by February.

Dealings have been good so far. Mitchell and his crew have seemingly gotten what we needed. Wimmer is a young CB to pair with Dier for the future. Alderweireld to pair up with Vertonghen and keep him happy. And Trippier will give Walker some much needed competition and cover.

Positions still needed are Striker with Adebayor and Soldado going, and a winger to give competition to Townsend, Chadli, and Lamela. Berahino would be good if we can get him relatively cheap. I think Werner might be a good pickup, young and pretty good to compete with Kane. For winger, I'm not quite sure. I could see Yedlin filling in if Poch thinks he can compete in at least the Europa league but one injury means relying too much on too many inexperienced players so maybe if we could get Hermann or Bellarabi.

In terms of selling, you'd have to think we're doing everything we can to shift Ade, Chiriches and probably also Lennon. Tommy Carroll is a bit of an interesting one, as I'm just not that clear on where he stands. It's *possible* that he's seen as an understudy to Bentaleb, but I think it's more likely that we're looking to ship him out.

I have huge hopes for Dier this season, and I think getting to play and prepare regularly as a centreback will be incredibly helpful to his development.  *Getting* minutes is probably going to be his biggest challenge, which I guess is where rotation in Europe and the cups will be important.

I disagree a little with your thoughts on Fazio, though. Perhaps this is a reflection of the lower status I held him in to begin with, but I see him as an incredibly valuable option against teams with bigger, slower forwards, and also as an experienced partner to Dier/Wimmer.

In my experience, you know who generally were louder, brasher, and more rowdy? The Australians and the Spaniards. *By a mile*. It's a tie between the two, really. At least Aussies be quiet if you ask them to. You know who else were loud? Students! *All* of them. From everywhere. USA, Oz, London, Manchester, Wales, France, Italy, Canada, ...Surrey (My flatmate was from Surrey and she was one of the loudest people I've ever met lol)... it does not matter.

Yes, many Americans are loud. You basically have to be loud in the States. It's a loud place. But, DrHydeous, to say ALL Americans are loud just because the Americans you've personally met have been loud is a huge over-generalisation. For one thing, I will say perhaps some of the people others hear as Americans are actually Canadians. I find some Canadians often even louder, more arrogant, and more obnoxious than Americans, believe it or not. And, you know, there are all sorts of people. Some are loud, some are not. I know a great many Americans who are soft-spoken, shy, and/or unintrusive. Like theactorkevineldon said, it's very likely you would never have noticed them in a crowd. The only ones you do notice are the loud ones. Who knows how many quiet ones have just passed you by without even a glance.

All that said, clearly you haven't spent much time around British youth when they're travelling if you want to talk about loud... Put them out in the sunshine and suddenly they're basically intolerable, drunken louts. (This also applies to many middle-aged English men on holidays in warm destinations as well.)

In fairness though, I have to say when I visited Iceland the first time, the American family in the airport were by far the worst I've ever heard, complete with a massive domestic argument and horrible yelling children. It was like an episode of Real Housewives of New Jersey meets Jeremy Kyle. But then the flight back from Ireland, I was surrounded on all sides by my fellow countrymen (Canadians) and I wanted to shoot myself in the face they were SO loud, **SO officious**, and SO obnoxious.

2. CM, ST, RW

3. For CM I would love Bender, but if McCarthy is the best we can do I'll take him. My top choice ST is Timo Werner followed by Berahino and Batsuyai? For RW I'd be glad to see Mirallas come in. I also wouldn't mind Carrasco either but he's LW.

4. Ade, Lennon, Soldado, Vlad and maybe Fazio.

null,false,bachus2015,null,null,null,"It's illegal to cause an unnecessary obstruction of a road. It must legally be a public road  (not a private road/path which is not an offence but is a civil matter including civil trespass). If someone is accompanying the vehicle and refuses to move it from obstructing the road, the police can fine the driver on the spot and also remove his vehicle.

If the vehicle is unaccompanied and causing an unnecessary obstruction, the police can choose to issue a fine (which is left on the window on display) OR have the vehicle seized/removed to a car impound. Usually a vehicle is removed when it is blatantly blocking a road preventing pedestrians or vehicles from travelling through.


The only exemptions would be:

* If it was blocking the road for an emergency (i.e. it was a **necessary** obstruction)

* Temporarily for deliveries/access (e.g. loading/unloading a delivery) ***unless*** street signage indicates otherwise.



Ordinarily blocking a road would be a non-emergency call to the police (101) however if it poses a risk of serious injury to someone or there is a risk of serious damage, it could be treated as an emergency (999).

-----------------------Lloris----------------------

-Trippier-------Toby---------Jan----------Rose-

-----------------------Kane----------------------

* I think Jan will improve having a steady partner next to him. It was Dier's first year in the league, Fazio is as quick as continental drift, Kaboul had one game left in his legs, and Chriches is...

I think Lamela will find his legs in the league this year. I think the system suits him, because he runs around all match, he just has to not give the ball away as much.

I think this is the year that Bentaleb becomes one of the better midfielders in the league.

[According to yougov:](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/07/20/comment-george-osborne-partly-right/)

Child tax credit change to 2 children is supported by 67% of the public and 50% of labour voters, and opposed by 20% of the public and 32% of labour voters.

A lower benefit cap is supported by 67% of the public and 47% of labour voters and opposed by 20% of the public and 34% of labour voters. 

Labour voters don't like all of it though, but 54% of the public like the inheritance tax cut while 32% don't and 32% of labour like it and 52% don't. 

Its pretty much the same for under 21's claiming housing benefit, most people like it, but labour people don't.

The only policies which labour and the public don't like together are the student grants and the freeze in public sector workers wages. All other budget policies are individually more popular with the public or with the public and labour voting people.

And the tax free £11,000 is immensely popular alongside the 'living wage', with a huge majority alongside labour voters too.

I'm very pleased we have competent depth in every backline position, which was a real struggle for us last season. Im looking forward to having the confidence in all def positions we had at left back last season (even when both Davies and Rose were injured, we still had Super Jan).

&gt;What positions still need to be looked at?

Although this contradicts when I have said earlier in the window, I'm no longer convinced we need to sign another CM or DM. We have a player in Toby who can play just in front of the back four in the few games where we set up to counter a specific threat. Our CM options are Bentaleb/Mason/Alli/Dembele/Carrol With Toby/Eriksen/Pritch able to cover there in emergencies. If we do sign any CM type players I would prefer cheap youth with mounds of potential.

To answer the question, We will need a back up striker who can play Left AM and CF. Again someone young but semi-proven in one of the stronger European leagues (Dutch, French, Portugese ). Saido Berahino would be too expensive.

&gt;Should we look to sell anyone else?
