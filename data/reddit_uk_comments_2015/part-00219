Also, considering that £654 goes to paying off the mortgage rather than to an estate agent means that it's actually costing me considerably less than renting, as otherwise I pay £854 in my current situation and it doesn't go towards anything. 

The risk of the mortgage going up in price or the value of the house going down I suppose is just another risk such as my rental costs going up over the same time, so it's a risk either way I suppose.

For the New Series Adventures the best place to start would probably be whoever your favorite TARDIS team is.

* If you are really aching for more 9th Doctor and Rose take a look at all his novels. They are a little up and down on his characterization at first as well as in quality but the Rose/Jack novels are generally pretty great especially **The Deviant Strain and Only Human**. 

* If you like Ten and Rose then go ahead and read their novels. I don't remember if any really stand out but I think **The Feast of the Drowned, The Stone Rose, and The Nightmare of Black Island** were well liked.

* If you like Ten and Martha well there are a lot of them so dive in. I think this set is consistently decent but nothing too special. Read **The Story of Martha** if you want to learn about her year traveling the Earth alone in The Last of The Time Lords.

* There are only a few Donna and Ten novels but there is a great one that also includes Willfred Mott called **Beautiful Chaos**

* The Tenth Doctor then has a set of companion-less adventures. In this set **Prisoner of the Daleks** is definitely considered a highlight by many.

* I haven't really read or looked into the Eleven and Pond novels but have heard good things about **The Silent Stars Go By, Touched By An Angel, and Dead of Winter.**

* There is only one Eleven and Clara book if I am remembering correctly

* The first three Twelfth Doctor and Clara novels were began before we even got to see the Twelfth Doctor. **The Blood Cell** is pretty cool being a first person account from neither the Doctor nor Clara.

null,false,WeaponizedKissing,null,null,null,"&gt; Surely the housing association due to owning part of the property would want to sell it for the highest price they could, considering they have a stake in the property?

I would assume so too, but if you go searching for horror stories about Shared Ownership or Shared Equity then that is a common issue.

The majority of complaints that I see about it tend to revolve around:

1. Rent/service charge increasing by huge amounts.  
2. Housing Association selling far too slowly.  
3. You having all the responsibilities of a home owner, and none of the protections of a tenant, despite paying all the costs of a homeowner and of a tenant.

My counter point to all of those is that they are all things that you can know up front, can get sorted out in a contract, and should have full knowledge of when the time comes. A lot of the ""horror stories"" seem to be along the lines of ""I had no idea my rent could increase!"" or ""I needed to sell really quick by the HA were so slow"". Of course, I'm sure that was inconvenient but if a buyer does their due diligence none of that should come as a surprise.

You are right though, I meant to say Fabregas is the deep lying playmaker, while Matic is the holding midfielder. 

In regards to your final question, both. He does not have the skill to displace Fernandinho or Fabregas nor does he fit into the playing style those teams implement. 

Also, I do not understand how I am backtracking. I am consistent in my belief that Henderon does not have the ability nor does he fit the play style of teams in the top four. None of those teams use a runner/engine type player like Henderson. He would be exposed as either a deep lying playmaker or a holding midfielder in a top team.

AFAIK the vast majority of the PE department (5/6 total) go on both the sports tour trip (the one in question) and the Ski Trip, which happens on the first half term of every year, but I am unsure of how the teacher's trips are funded. 

In defence of the school, they do offer other trips with varying price ranges. For example, we have a 'Rewards Day' in which we are given 3/4 options of places to go as a reward for the years work. There is a free option (staying in school w/ 'fun' activities) and a trip to Alton Towers / Flamingo Land ranging at about £25-30 ontop of cheap-ish options such as going to the cinema or bowling (aprox £15). 

**Edit:** The school says that it does help those who feel that they cannot go due to financial limitations but I have not experienced this first hand so I don't know how this works.

If you have any questions, I'll answer them sooner or later once I get time.

You do not need a licence if you only watch DVDs/Blu-ray discs and non-live streamed TV programs. You are allowed to own a TV without a licence provided that the TV is not used to watch TV.


They can get a warrant, but they need some sort of evidence to get one.

In general, when TV licencing get warrants it is because the person has told them something, or done something specific to give them evidence. For example, the inspector knocks on the door, and trips you up with a question (e.g. I: Sorry to trouble you in the middle of Eastenders. You: Don't worry, I'm not really watching it.)

Best thing to do, is just apologise for wasting their time, tell them that you have no need for a TV licence and ask them to leave. Answer no questions. Do not allow them in. 

It is important not to answer ANY questions, as they are will ask questions which are designed to trip you up - for example:
I: Do you have a TV.
You: Yes. But I only watch DVDs and netflix.
I: Do you ever watch streaming video on a computer or streambox?
You: Yes
I: What sites do you use? Have you tried TV catchup?
You: I don't use that one much. I mainly use netflix.

Bzzt - you've just put your foot in it. You need a licence to watch TV catchup because it is a livestream of a TV broadcast.",null,0,null,1433888165,null,0,1433888829,0,cs13o1h,null,t3_395f6m,null,t1_cs13o1h,null,t1_cs114xl,null,null,null,1436859871,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Thatcher [revalued the currency using Scottish oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiership_of_Margaret_Thatcher#Deflationary_strategy) so as to make the UK a better choice for financial business but a worse choice for manufacturing exports. She transitioned the economy into what it is today.

The problem was that the only London received assistance for this e.g. the creation of [Canary Wharf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Wharf), lots of tax breaks and investments into the banking industry. Which was fine if you lived in London.

The consequences of this were mass unemployment in the northern areas of the UK. And as the Tories had few votes to lose in those areas it was no skin off their nose. 

Given that it was Scottish oil that enabled this in the first place you can quite honestly say that we are the only nation to ever strike oil and become poorer as a direct result.

&gt; he is understood to have been tricked into posting images on a social networking site.
&gt; One line of investigation being followed is that his abusers threatened him that if he didn’t hand over money, the  images would go viral.

I'm only speculating, but if YikYak was at all involved in this, it was probably due to people in his local area making light of pictures being posted on Facebook or somewhere. YikYak allows anonymous posters within a 10 mile radius (or so I believe) to post text. Pictures cannot be posted on YikYak. 

It also just so happened that there was media coverage on Friday about YikYak being used in cyber bullying cases: http://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/belfast-news/northern-ireland-mlas-urged-take-9403360

A local suicide hotline was calling for apps like it to be regulated. 

It's a common scam these days. A scammer (usually from a developing nation) will pretend to be a fellow youngster on an internet chat room and will ask for nude pics or other embarrassing information and will friend them on Facebook, then they'll demand money off them in return for not posting the pictures up on their Facebook for all their friends to see.

null,false,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,null,"The cost of renewable energy is high. Very high when compared to fossil fuel, and even building new fossil fuel plants is substantially more expensive than continuing to run old plants.

The government is agreeing a fixed price for the electricity sold for a certain period of time - probably 35 years, because if the electricity was sold at the going rate (about £50/MWh) then the project would never pay for itself. The break-even price is estimated to be about £110-150/MWh assuming a 120 year payback period, so the government has agreed to pay £168/MWh for 35 years, assuming that the system works.

The problem with the government paying for it to be built is that the taxpayers take the risk of the project failing, or the system not working as planned. In which case, the taxpayer has paid £1 billion for something which doesn't work, or maybe they hit some sort of unexpected snag, and the cost actually works out at £2 billion with large delays and spiralling interest costs.

The advantage of the contract for difference, is that the taxpayers only pay when the project goes online, and they only pay based on performance. It's more expensive, but it's less risky. 

From the point of view of the government, the first one is always the most risky - because the design might not have all the kinks worked out. Suppliers may run into problems designing new parts, the builders may have trouble getting enough staff to do the work, or training staff on new techniques which haven't been used before in the UK, etc.

If the first one can be built, then maybe it would be easier to build more in the future. That's a bit of an assumption, and one that isn't actually very good because big construction projects tend to take so long and need so many people that lessons and skills don't get learned very well.

Obviously, Pogba would be perfect but he may be a little unrealistic. That said I think we should break the bank and really go for him.

The Novelizations usually expand on certain elements of the serials and remove issues with serials brought about by poor production so visit these occasionally if you feel an episode didn't make sense or you couldn't get through it because of the production. Some novelizations you should read after you see the serial: **The Auton Invasion, Day of the Daleks, Remembrance of the Daleks, Battlefield, The Curse of Fenric, Gareth Robert's Shada, Twin Dilemma, any of the novelizations for the missing episodes like Power of the Daleks especially if the reconstructions aren't working out for you.**

The VMA's and PDA's don't really have a continuity but some are sequels or follow on directly from Classic episodes so you can probably pick them up as you go through Classic Who. Some suggestions from the VMA's: **Goth Opera, The Romance of Crime, Cold Fusion, The Scales of Injustice, The Dark Path, The Empire of Glass**(if you want to know who this Braxiatel fellow is). Some suggestions from the PDA's: **The Face of the Enemy, Festival of Death, The Witch Hunters, The Infinity Doctors, Divided Loyalties. Business Unusual**

As for the VNA's and the EDA's they continue the stories for the Seventh Doctor after the cancellation of Classic Who and the Eighth Doctor after the TV Movie respectively.

I limited the choices to six who I think are the most obvious candidates:

* **Henderson** has obviously been our vice-captain this season and captained the England U-21s.
* **Skrtel** is captain of the Slovakian national team and our second longest tenured player.
* **Milner** has (briefly) been captain of England and has been tipped by the likes of Carra as a contender.
* **Lucas** is our longest tenured player and was captain for Grêmio and the Brazil U-20s.
* **Sakho** was previously captain at PSG and France youth team captain at every level.
* **Lallana** was captain of Southampton for two years before joining us.

- Look into how easy it is to sell on a partially owned property. Right now, it is my understanding the secondary market is difficult, although that may change as rising house prices make shared ownership increasingly attractive. Also remember that should London enter a recession and you get into financial distress from a combination of redundancy and house price falls, you might need to sell quickly. 
- Also factor in fees for lawyers, surveyors etc into your calculations.
- Check very clearly what the future cost would be for different scenarios of house price movements and interest rates, and make sure you can afford them.

The value for money was pretty variable as well. There was talk of putting together a south coast consortium to bypass that, but it was never a goer.

You ended up switching between coke and pepsi on a three-yearly basis, and we (pompey) had to negotiate a specific exemption to allow us to carry Britvic blackcurrant regardless of who the cordial supplier was that year (because snakey-b wasn't the same without it).

NUSSL also meant signing up to the ropey-as-fuck NUS Ents deals. Cowboys, they really were. Fucking appalling.

B) alcohol consumption reduces the incidence of heart and blood conditions to the point that you have to be drinking quite a lot to have the negative effects (on longevity) overtake those of the ones you erase by drinking. This leads to the infamous j-shape curve where risk of mortality decreases if you (as a statistical member of the population) drink at all, giving maximum benefit somewhere about the UK maximum daily guidelines (not how they are calculated I don't think) and then the detriment starts increasing so overall benefit declines until you get to zero benefit (giving you the same risk of mortality as a t-totaller) at some outrageous amount. The number varies by study but I've seen it as high as the units in a standard  bottle of wine a day. then obviously if you drink more it (risk f death in micromorts) skyrockets up very quickly.

1) You make the economy potentially more resilient to the next major crisis, as you have more ""slack"" for raising taxes, less debt (which is compounded in influence when the economy shrinks) and greater share of GDP coming from the private sector, which has a number of possible advantages.

2) You (theoretically) lay the foundation for more robust economic growth from the private sector, as the public sector is less intrusive in the economy, the private sector doesn't have to compete with the public sector for markets, various inputs etc. in the same way.  

3) This isn't exactly a point for austerity, but more against it's alternative as it normally manifests itself: governments often seem to invest in things which don't have any Keynesian multiplier effect. i.e. they ""invest"" £1 and get £1 of ""growth"" out of it. You're effectively displacing private sector spending and investment (which might stimulate growth) just to put the money back in the system in a way that doesn't simulate growth. In fact, most of the growth we experienced since the mid 90s (save for 2 or 3 years) can be explained by a combination of population increase and an increase in public spending. Little apparent multiplier effect at all.

There is no doubt that without Messi barca nor Argentina for that matter would of had the amount of success they have had recently without him. 

However I do believe that it can be argued that Suarez is the best player in the world right now. He did not have the opportunity to show his skill in the last world cup due to his own faults (the only world cup where Messi has truly shined). And when he was with us he made everyone else look like they were world class. Sterling looked like he could be the next best thing with Suarez pulling defenders and giving him space in the number 10 role, Sturridge had gaps to run behind CBs because they always had to be ready to hack Suarez down in case he received the ball. Based off skill alone (and assuming Suarez wasn't suspended at all in 2014) he really could of won the Ballon De Or over Ronaldo.

Messi is the face of barca, similar to how Gerrard was the face of Liverpool. I think we on this sub and outside the sub would agree that Suarez had way more impact on our title challenging season the Gerrard did, so I don't think it is far fetched to say that Suarez could be the difference maker in making Barcelona the best side in the world. Messi and Neymar make that team phenomenal but adding Suarez to the mix is borderline unfair. This is evident by the losing to Real last year in the semis of the Champions league without Suarez and then not really having any competition with him.this year (although I would not say it is totally down to Messi, Neymar, or Suarez individually, more of the combination of three).

So all in all, to counter your point I don't think it's hard to argue that Suarez is the best player in the world currently.

And Kondogbia plays more central midfield than he does defensive midfield. From what i've seen against Arsenal he was great on the ball and provided good support in the attack. 

The names you mentioned are all great, particularly the first 4. 

However I do think we need a stronger physical presence in midfield (which is what those players you mentioned would bring), Fabregas just isn't enough and we lost the midfield far too easily against PSG. Mourinho even brought in Ramires to bring more physicality and even that wasn't enough. Mikel isn't enough for europe either. 

So whoever we bring in, I would want them to be strong physically.

Put them on in the background while you do something else and just listen to them, they are really funny shows.

null,false,TheBlueNomad,null,null,null,"If a player like Matuidi were to join Chelsea, i think he would then play as a box-to-box midfielder. He would be making runs from deep. When we have another midfielder on the pitch, opposition teams would be forced to invest energy in stopping him or else they will be punished. Fabregas has been wonderful in his new position. No need to change that. What we need is another strong midfielder that can help out both Matic and Fabregas. Kondogbia is a defensive midfielder, winning balls and tackling is his bread and butter. I have been watching him ever since he was on the Youth levels playing for his national team. Having two DM's would only disrupt how we play. Unless, of course we are playing against big teams and we are content to just sit back and soak the pressure. We need players that can dictate the tempo of the match not help us defend opposition from attacking. That player doesn't necessarily have to be in the mold of Matuidi. I would prefer someone like Koke(his passing), Pogba( his strength, he seems like Jose type) or even Hamsik(his energy and drive). Physical strength won't be a great factor, if the player can pass the ball like Fabregas. And Koke is the closest thing to Fabregas when it comes to passing the ball and dictating the tempo. How many teams are playing with two DM's? Even when we had big midfielders like Ballack and Essien, we still played with only one DM(even though, that was greatest DM). Matic would help us for the physicality part. Btw, Matuidi is strong so is Cabaye and Hamsik.

He plays best next to matic from deep, but mourinho never plays him there against big teams with physical midfield because he gets outmuscled. And when he gets moved up to a no.10 he doesn't play well there either. He gets surrounded, isolated, and taken out of the game. He needs time and space which is what he gets from deep midfield. In fact he's historically gone missing a lot of times in big games even prior to coming to chelsea. 

He was what we needed to unlock defences in the league which we struggled with last year, but against the hottest european opposition, I'm not too confident about him.

The must do's in my opinion are;

- the Albert Dock (you can either wander round, shop or go for a meal there. I really like Pan Am, or Circo. EastzEast is nice but you don't have the view there) 

- if you like music and the Beatles pop into the Cavern Club. Some nights they have Beatles tribute acts playing

- do at least one of the museums or art galleries. There's the Tate modern on the docks, the Walker, the Museum of Liverpool, the maritime museum etc

- architecture, Liverpool has the most listed buildings outside London. A couple of highlights are The Three Graces (Liver building, Cunard building and Port of Liverpool building) and the Anglican cathedral. 

- if you're interested in Titanic, the old white star line head quarters (30 james street) is now a hotel with a restaurant/bar on the top floor. Decent views from up there too

- Panoramic 34 has fab views, it's a restaurant/bar. It is pricey though. They do afternoon tea too.

- Bold street is brilliant for places to eat. A couple of highlights are Mowgli and Maray. Bakchich is meant to be nice too but I've never tried it

- Seel street is great for nightlife. I love Alma de Cuba (it's a converted church), Berry and Rye is a secret speakeasy along Berry st, there's an absinthe bar above Zanzibar

Try using a comparative website to see which card you are most likely to be accepted for- unfortunately if you have no credit rating or poor credit rating you won't have the best available deals. You might need to suck it up until you've built up a good enough score to warrant a better deal. 

When I was looking in a similar situation (ie to credit build) Capital One gave me a card with a small £250 limit. After a few months of paying the balance off in full and increasing my credit score the limit was increased- but if all your doing is buying fuel and paying it off each month the limit shouldn't matter. 

In addition, read up on ways to build your credit- examples would be, make sure you're on the electoral roll, no CCJs, defaults, bankruptcy etc, pay any other credit payments on time (car finance, store cards, catalogues). 

I would also check all of your credit reports and check yourself for any errors. Noddle provide them for free. Experian have a 30 day free trial (get your report and remember to call and cancel within 30 days) £14.95 a month thereafter. I believe Equifax are the same. Thoroughly check them for personal details (addresses), and current and previous credit commitments. Any errors or concerns get it fixed asap.

- First, it assumes that efficiency is the goal, which it isn't. The goal is impact. 

- Secondly, it does not recognise the problems with comparing M&amp;A. Different types of charities can have very different administrative demands. Furthermore, some simple changes in accounting practice can radically reduce reported M&amp;A whilst doing nothing to change the actual bill.

Hard? it's extremely easy. Do some research and see if a Scotch egg is ""unhealthy"" - whatever that actually means.

A quick Google search dispels the myth, most of which comes from the myth of saturated fats and cholesterol. 

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/1346656/Time-to-scotch-egg-myth-says-expert.html

It's an egg and sausage, and children already eat that.

EDIT: now I'm on a desktop, I can show what I've found:


""There can’t be:

\* drinks with added sugar, crisps, chocolate or sweets in school meals and vending machines

\* **more than 2 portions of deep-fried, battered or breaded food a week**""

source: https://www.gov.uk/school-meals-healthy-eating-standards 

Therefore Scotch Eggs *are* allowed to be served for school lunch, which implies that children can also bring them in a packed lunch.

""Checklist for school food other than lunch

FOODS HIGH IN FAT, SUGAR AND SALT No more than two portions of food that has been deep-fried, batter-coated, breadcrumb-coated, each week (applies across the whole school day)""

source: http://www.schoolfoodplan.com/standards/

source: http://www.schoolfoodplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Checklist-for-school-food-other-than-lunch-140616.pdf


The government published School Food Standards don't even mention Scotch Eggs explicitly: http://www.schoolfoodplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/School-Food-Standards-Guidance-FINAL-140911-V2C.pdf

They simply say, like I wrote above, that the aim is to limit deep fried foods, but that food can and should be provided from various food groups. e.g. meat and eggs, and should be limited by weight per day depending on the age of the child.


The guidelines also say:

""Exemptions to the school food regulations

**The School Food Regulations do not apply to food provided**:

a. at parties or celebrations to mark religious or cultural occasions

b. at fund-raising events

c. as rewards for achievement, good behaviour or effort

d. for use in teaching food preparation and cookery skills, including where the food
prepared is served to pupils as part of a school lunch

**e. on an occasional basis by parents or pupils**""

&gt; The economists find that average annual growth of per capita GDP fell from 2.6% per year in the three decades prior to 1980 to 2.2% per year in the following decades to 2007, and a decline of 0.2% per year since 2007. Productivity growth slowed even more sharply, from 2.9% per year in the three decades prior to 1980, compared with 1.7% from 1980 to 2007, and a decline of 0.2% per year since 2007.

I would like to read the actual paper, because there is danger of implying correlation is causation. The ""three decades prior"" included a lot of reconstruction after the wars which could ""artificially"" (or rather temporally) inflate figures. Then you have to consider the impact of globalisation, and whether this would have put a downward pressure on growth irrelevant of the policies.

There are a lot of factors that feed into figures like GDP, and before I take the conclusion this headline points to at heart, I would personally like to see how the research considers them. 

&gt; Economic growth has also been more volatile, with fluctuations in GDP coming in “large waves in contrast to the ripples of the 1950s and 1960s”. 

This, for example, might indicate a lower average GDP growth, but a higher GDP growth and higher GDP decrease. That, IMO, would slightly change the debate into ""is it possible to actually prevent crises in a liberal free market"", as if so the higher GDP rate could be more sustainable.

Any socialist who's read Marx with any diligence will know to distinguish feudlism from capitalism, although, in a sense, the manner in which feudalism transitioned into early forms of mercantilist capitalism in a slow and fairly piecemeal fashion in most societies does make that line blurred, even in societies like France which followed a distinctly revolutionary path.

On the other hand, you're certainly right that there isn't only one form of capitalism, any less within a society as between them.  Take the UK - we've clearly transitioned through at least three distinctive forms: mercantilism, industrial capitalism, and post-industrial or financialised capitalism.  And you can make many finer distinctions if you wish, as well as observing the cyclical movements between State and private flavours of capitalism, which in parts of the world has become fully-fledged State capitalism, and in others much less strongly distinguished forms of social democracy, ""welfare"" capitalism, mixed economies etc..

&gt;The fact remains that communism is now used to refer to the system of state socialism (you would call it state capitalism, but I vehemently oppose that kind of revisionist hand waving) present in the self proclaimed communist countries during the cold war.

See, I identify _this_ as not only revisionism, but as deliberate propaganda - coming from both Western and Soviet security apparatus.  Lenin himself described the country's _intention_ to progress towards socialism whilst actually having _achieved_ State capitalism by the end of his life - which he viewed as an achievement of sorts because the country had had to transition from feudalism.  The Soviets loved to play up the socialist thing as - at the time - it had an incredible cachet; since the horrors of Stalinism and Maoism have been revealed (and often exaggerated), the Western security services have loved to play it up for the opposite reason.",null,0,null,1433920662,null,0,false,0,cs1k3bf,null,t3_3957v5,null,t1_cs1k3bf,null,t1_cs19ilm,null,null,null,1437562765,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The stats &amp; the whole ""House of Cards"" analogy point to the fact that Scottish football needs competition to attract floating viewers. The most likely source of genuine competition is Rangers, but that's the last thing the author wants to say so he/she crafts a theory that the media should do more to present the current SPL as a genuine competition, despite all the evidence to the contrary.

Most could look at those stats and say a few things: SPL currently suffers on average (relative to it's potential audience) because people don't believe it's competitive and it lacks the audience within the Rangers support. Rangers, Hearts and Hibs viewing figures were boosted by a few one off factors (e.g. having a weekend without English football), suggesting the media that were pilloried for suggesting the Championship would generate more interest than the SPL this year had it roughly right.

Besides that I'd say the Rangers, Hearts &amp; Hibs audiences were kind of artificially boosted by a Celtic audience tuning in fancying their chances to see Rangers hammered. If you think, besides people who watch all the games, there's chunks of discretionary audience (Celtic, Rangers, Others) - the Rangers, Hearts and Hibs games crossed all 3 for some bigger matches, Celtic probably 2 in their bigger games.

The OP doesn't need to say much more than that, competition = interest/viewers.

I think it would help Scottish football to get over Rangers a bit here. Not every article needs to be reworked to make sure it satisfies a belief that the game doesn't need them.

could you prove your IP address streamed iPlayer?  Yes

Can they prove it was actually you, or anyone else in the household?  No.  

The reason is the fundamental way IP/TCP works and the standards.  Each internet enabled device has a MAC address, your router strips out MAC addresses from each device you use to access the internet, what the BBC website see's is only the IP address of the WAN port on the router (the outward public facing port) it uses DHCP on the private side which issues private IP addresses to each device connected to the router.  

So the BBC website can only see the single Public IP address, it doesn't see what device is using it.  Any concrete identifying proof is eliminated at the router.  And as routers are inherently insecure allowing anyone with even the modest knowledge of exploits able to crack the wireless security.

null,false,Battle_Biscuits,null,null,null,"&gt;TTIP will give corporations the power to sue nation states if they act against their interests.

This arrangement has been part of similar trade deals for decades, Britain will have signed up to dozens if not hundreds of trade deals over the past fifty years that include Investor-State Dispute Settlement clauses and it hasn't caused us any major problems. As long as the ISDS clause is worded carefully then we're not going to get sued to death.

&gt;TTIP will drag down European standards

Only if the US decides to exert pressure on the EU to weaken its own trade standards and the EU actually bends its knee. This is unlikely though, the EU and the US are equal partners and have as much to gain and lose from this treaty. I'd be more worried about this if it was a bilateral agreement between a stronger and a weaker power like the the US and the UK, but that is not the case here.

&gt;TTIP is being negotiated in secret

Well of course it is, that's how trade negotiations work. The involvement of the media in negotiations would complicate an already difficult process. At the end of the negotiations though, a draft treaty will be proposed and issued to the public, and then its our representatives who say wherever we pass it or not.

&gt;It's a threat to our sovereignty

Not really, it's a trade agreement being negotiated by our democratically elected representatives- and it's all about harmonising our trade regulations. I don't see how agreeing to a new set of regulations goes against our sovereignty in any way. Those trade regulations would normally be decided by unelected government quangos anyway. 

&gt;Few economic benefits

The EU Commission says it will add 120 Billion EUR to the European economy, 90 billion to to the US and 100 to the world. Even if the Commission is widely exaggerating here, the economic benefits make this worth pursuing. We've benefited from having a free trade arrangement with Europe, so I'm quite happy to extend this arrangement across the Atlantic.

It's still council funded (I think), so it's relatively cheap, hardly anybody knows about it, so it's never too busy, and it's deceptively big. If you're not bothered about the ""big name"" animals (Lions, Giraffes, Elephants, etc.), then it's an amazing zoo. Personally, I prefer looking at some of the smaller, less common animals, so for me it's amazing.

Staying in Cannon Hill Park, something else that I find a lot of locals don't know is the MAC (Midlands Art Centre). Free to get in, usually has a touring exhibition on, and often have a load of local art. Some of the best exhibitions I've been to have been at the MAC. I saw Tim Shaw's *Black Smoke Rising* there, and hands down, it was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.

For a smaller ""attraction"" St. Edburgha's Church (or Yardley Old Church) as some know it. It's pretty cool and is one of the oldest churches in Birmingham (might be only second to St. Martins, not too sure), and the area around it is quite nice to walk around.

Our recent folly without UN mandate in Iraq was based largely on this retained attitude and history, that in some way it's was still our decision to determine how the country should be run and even now by whom. We had a colonial attitude, the U.S. simply wanted a misguided revenge and oil business (a repeat of early 1900's history in the region). 
Our partnership with France in Libya uses the same attitudes and logic to offer fleeting moments of triumphalism before leaving a government we decide we are happy with to try and deal with the mess.  
Yet more recently we were happy to sit back and let others take a lead, not attend meetings and quote UN mandates for the Ukraine conflict. 

Why would a country as small as ours with so much debt still feel it necessary to spend so much on defence, a naive position of grandeur. It's time we started learning how deal with our on issues rather than telling others how to live their lives and leaving decades of chaos after we have.

null,false,TheAntiqueTraveller,null,null,null,"The law states that any IP created by an employee in the course of their employment is automatically the employer's (I assume you will be an employee not a contractor). So even if your contract said nothing at all that would still be the case. However, ""in the course of employment"" does not mean any time you were employed - it means if you were doing what you did in furtherance of your general duties or as a result of being specifically asked by your employer. This does mean that stuff done in out of office hours can *potentially* be caught - being on company time or in the company building is not the defining feature under the law.

Example 1 - you are a software programmer. You go home and work on your own software project (especially if the subject matter is similar to what you do at work). There would be a risk that IP would go to your employer. 

Example 2 - you are a software programmer and you go home and write a novel. This is totally unrelated to your job so remains your own property.

If your contract is covering example 1 that is likely fine - it is probably mirroring what the law says anyway. If it is trying to cover example 2 I would say that is very unfair (possibly unenforceably so). The fact that it expressly states relating to the company means they are probably aiming at example 1 but only you have the complete wording. 

Overall if what you plan to do at home is in any way related to what you do at work or uses the same skills (eg if you were a painter and also painted at home, author who also wrote at home, etc) and you care about ownership of the IP just run it past your boss (in an email for the record) to make it clear that it is not related to your employment.

PSG aren't in as attractive a league and neither are they held in as high a regard as City, they generally don't play with attacking midfielders either and strictly stick to traditional wingers. Those two are the only other clubs with confirmed interest in him, luckily neither Real Madrid or Barcelona seem to be keen on him, which puts us in a great position.

With that said, I do think the most likely scenario is that he stays. He's only one season into a 5 year contract, and it's not like he's missing out on Champions League football or anything.

I think this is the key issue, Rodgers has shown he can work out methods to play at high levels (albiet largely reliant on fantastic strikers - we'd have finished 4th with Sturridge of season before this one). But he consistently makes weird choices and plays people out of position (though what do I know I'm just some random fan). 

If someone told me under Rodgers we'd finish 6th, 2nd and 5th I would think he had stabalised the club and most likely got beat out by a decent Arsenal to 4th in his 3rd year (they will become genuine contenders in the near future imo). But the manner of last seasons finish leaves a bitter feeling, I think Rodgers does have the ability to become a decent manager at a big club if he can sort out inconsistencies but if we are chucking money and Klopp is there, then yeah.

This past season, in November, when things weren't going very well, Rodgers went back to basic with a hardcore posession game.
And if my memory suits me correct, we were almost bank solid at times.
The problem then, was the attacking play, with little to no movement in front of the ball, and lack of precision in the last third.

I think Rodgers has shown that our team can play defensively solid under his command, but that with the problems we've been having in our attack, he had to throw that overboard to get some goals - hence the switch to 3-4-3.
The 3-4-3 was a sound system, which allowed us to get more men higher up the pitch, but it left big gaping holes defensively when Can went on his beserk runs - don't take me wrong, i love it -, and we got caught on the break.

In my mind Rodgers is a 4-3-3 man, and with the proper attacking trio - i think Coutinho will play in the midfield next year, since he has improved his defensive work rate a lot - we can have a good balance, playing both sound posession, and crazy counter-attack.

For an example of more successful economic policies I suggest instead looking at Britain during the time free trade was attempted.

'From 1815 to 1870 Britain reaped the benefits of being the world's first modern, industrialised nation. It was the 'workshop of the world', meaning that its finished goods were produced so efficiently and cheaply that they could often undersell comparable, locally manufactured goods in almost any other market. If political conditions in particular overseas markets were stable enough, Britain could dominate its economy through free trade alone without having to resort to formal rule or mercantilism. Britain was even supplying half the needs in manufactured goods of such nations as Germany, France, Belgium, and the United States. By 1820 30% of Britain's exports went to the Empire, rising slowly to 35% by 1910.[22] Apart from coal and iron, most raw materials had to be imported, so that in the 1830s the main imports were, in order, raw cotton (from the American South), sugar (from the West Indies), wool, silk, tea (from China), timber (from Canada), wine, flax, hides and tallow.[23] By 1900, the UK's global share soared to 22.8% of total imports. By 1922, the UK's global share soared to 14.9% of total exports and 28.8% of manufactured exports.[24]'

Personally, I dont feel it is worth it for me. Given your earnings, why not wait a few years and build up a deposit enough for a mortgage on a normal property ? I earn less than you but i manage to bank about 9k/year -  there are 2 bed flats from 135-200k on rightmove right now - even if the prices go up by 10-20%% in the time you save, thats still affordable and you'd own the whole thing instead, with less hassle, service charges and so on.

Also if you think that its likely your income will rise significantly in the next 2-3 years, could it be worth waiting for that so you have access to more mortgages (ie, maybe you could get a 3/4 bed if you were earning 65k.)?



Really its down to why you are doing it though. as an investment vehicle, especially if you are in a part of london where you can be sure the prices are rising (ie, near a crossrail station or planned transport hub / improvements ) then the *potential* gains from doing it for 5 years or could be worth it.

Exactly right. The Bank of England manages the British economy. They decide the price of housing, the yield of stocks and bonds and the level of inflation. There is no way to compete with central planners that control the supply of money.

The result of the BOE's market interference are a bubble in stocks, a bubble in bonds, a bubble in housing, an incredibly low amount of savings, a huge debt mountain ready to burst and an economy that looks ready to collapse.

When the inevitable happens and the economy finally does collapse no doubt 'capitalism' will be blamed by the media. They will also tell you there was no way anyone could have predicted the bubbles in everything will burst and that nobody could have possibly seen the impending economic disaster they've created coming.

i) I think there's a big difference between making stock decisions on economic  grounds as opposed to ideological grounds.  A decision over how many types of bean would maximize profits is quite a bit different from a decision over whether it's moral to sell e.g. a novel which mentions homosexuality.

ii) Yes a shop can decide what it sells and I have no wish to force them to sell any product.  But I'm not questioning anyone's legal right.  I'm questioning our students' commitment to intellectual freedom.

My position is that it's authoritarian and anti-intellectual to try to decide for other adults what newspapers they should or shouldn't be reading.  And likely you would agree if it were a newspaper or novel *you* happened to like or thought worth defending.

null,false,gamas,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt; i) I think there's a big difference between making stock decisions on economic grounds as opposed to ideological grounds. A decision over how many types of bean would maximize profits is quite a bit different from a decision over whether it's moral to sell e.g. a novel which mentions homosexuality.

A shop has the freedom to decide what ideological values it holds when stocking products. Like a said a vegan store, whose owners likely hold vegan values, isn't going to stock meat and other animal products, and I wouldn't expect it to. I wouldn't expect a Christian book store to stock Islamic texts. And I wouldn't expect an organic food store to stock factory farmed goods.

Universities have decided, through mutual co-operation with their affiliated Students' Union, that the values it represents are the values of its students - as decided by the democratic vote of representatives in the SU. The students decided on values that happen to align with left-wing stance in this instance. The denigration of women is a value that the students decided they didn't want to be espoused, so the university campus store decided it wouldn't stock things that denigrate women, given that its main (and possibly only) customers are the students.

&gt;  (e.g. I suspect you would feel irate if a campus bookshop refused to stock any books mentioning homosexuals or newspapers which ran articles on global warming.)

Nice try, but nope. I would be disappointed that the campus bookshop was stuck in the past, and I would certainly implore the students to lobby for the book store to reconsider its values (given the students are the only customers of the book store, it would be a pretty successful lobby). 

However, ultimately, whilst a store is not allowed to discriminate over who it sells to, it is allowed to use its FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION to decide what it sells. It is then up to the customer to decide whether or not they then do business with the store, based on the store's values. And up to the store to decide whether its values are ones that allow them to attract the customers they want. As someone who is massively in favour of freedom of expression, I would have thought you'd be celebrating the fact that the campus store has such freedom to decide its values.

For that reason, I am also of the opinion that the outcome of the Asher's bakery case was wrong. The bakery wasn't discriminating against the gay couple, they just chose not to sell a product that didn't go with their company values.

EDIT: Come to think of it, allowing the ban works even if you hold the view that stores should only make stock decisions based on economical reasons. The fact is that a store needs to consider the clientèle it wishes to attract. The customers are incredibly important to the profitability of the store, so ideally the values of the store need to reflect the values of it customer. If the customers are saying they will refuse to visit a store that stocks a newspaper that has page 3 girls, then the store has a powerful economic reason not to stock The Sun. If the store wanted to stock The Sun, then they shouldn't make their only customer base a left-wing group...",null,0,null,1433928530,null,0,1433929212,0,cs1lznc,null,t3_3955dp,null,t1_cs1lznc,null,t1_cs1ltot,null,null,null,1436871293,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

&gt;__St Thomas' Peace Garden__ is a small public park in [Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham), England designated as a monument to peace and a memorial to all those killed in armed conflict. It was designed around the tower and west porticos of St. Thomas's Church, Bath Row, which was half demolished in the [Birmingham Blitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Blitz) in 1940 and never restored. The grounds were laid out in 1955 to commemorate the coronation of [Queen Elizabeth II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_II). They were redesigned in 1995 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the end of WWII. When the world leaders came to Birmingham for the [G8 summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24th_G8_summit) in 1998, each planted a tree. Each premier chose a tree that most represented their respective countries and they are now a living symbol of peace. Although the Peace Garden is within St Thomas' grounds this is a site that is for everyone including the ever growing numbers of non-religious people of Birmingham, the West Midlands and the World.

The prospect of what GMO's could do for the future of the world is mind boggling.

The prospects for what may be possible is almost limitless. We have already created cells that can convert sugars into diesel and we haven't even yet managed to create a novel cell from scratch.

But the problem is that whilst some of the arguments against GMO's are legitimate concerns the vast majority of anti-GMO rhetoric firmly comes from anti-intellectualism or religious irrationalism.

&gt;Note that it was not a case of protecting citizens but of protecting “hard-working citizens”. The part of the document in which this reference is to be found has come from the Home Office. Unless the Minister is going to dissociate himself from the wording, perhaps when he responds to the debate he will indicate which citizens the Government do not regard as “hard-working” so that we can all be clear on precisely who is not covered by the Bill in the eyes of the Home Office. Perhaps he could then tell us why the Home Office thinks that the purpose of the Bill is specifically to “protect hard-working citizens” when, as is pointed out in the Explanatory Notes—the Minister has confirmed this today—the Government’s election manifesto commitment was to create a blanket ban,

&gt;*“protecting young people from exposure to so-called ‘legal highs’”.*

OK David, so what does that mean? There's been a fuckload of soul searching by Labour on this issue but no actual answers. 

We're sort of walking towards this precipice where Labour can either rejuvenate under someone and something new or enter Pasokification (with a concurrent long, unbroken spell of Tory government). Even the former doesn't guarantee a majority under boundary changes and the rise of the SNP - Labour are going to have to make some sort of peace with Scotland.

The one half-decent pamphlet I read from Compass said, correctly, that New Labour and Old Labour don't have the answers. They are each right on some things and wrong on others. But then it didn't propose any fucking answers, beyond the party being more democratic and connecting to communitarian movements. Which would be great, but it's not on its own putting a red rosette in Number 10 in 2020. 

I think three things that should probably happen (besides those two Compass proposals) are:

1) Everybody who has served in the last government has too much baggage. The next Labour Prime Minister is more likely to have come from the last two elections than not. In other words, be prepared to overthrow any leader elected this year for Keir Starmer, Dan Jarvis, or anybody else we don't know about. 

2) Labour will only win with Big Ideas. Piecemeal, half-assed solutions to problems like the economy, housing, welfare, education, immigration, the EU, or whatnot are not going to cut it. Tory Lite? Either go Beyond Tory (please don't) and make your case for why that's better for The People or utterly repudiate the Tories. People think the issues above are big problems, and Labour tend to have small answers for them.

3) Labour's going to need to connect with middle *and* working class voters again. I guess that's kind of a rehash of two, really - Big Ideas that change the game for those people the way that some of Thatcher's giveaways changed the game for working-class people and allowed them the Tories to reconfigure themselves as the party for White Van Man (which they really weren't before 1979).

Wrong. 

For Israelis, you can never be pro-Israel enough. If half the population of the UK decided to get together to suicide-bomb Gaza while chanting ""Bibi is God!"" the Israelis would still be convinced the BBC had something against them when they put put a report dryly telling us about this and people from Golders Green would be calling in to LBC complaining that the BBC was anti-semitic.

Yes they have the legal freedom.  I already answered that.  Still - if a campus store decides to limit newspapers on ideological grounds then I think that they are acting in a way that is harming  others' intellectual freedom.

&gt;Universities have decided, through mutual co-operation with their affiliated Students' Union, that the values it represents are the values of its students - as decided by the democratic vote of representatives in the SU. 

Doesn't impress me.  Intellectual freedom should never be put up for a vote.  Doing so will only lead to punishment and censorship of unpopular ideas.  Democracy is great, but it should never be used to decide what other people can read.

&gt;Nice try, but nope. I would be disappointed that the campus bookshop was stuck in the past

You would only be disappointed if a campus bookstore banned books mentioning homosexuality?  I would be *livid*.  I would also consider it an assault on freedom of thought.  

&gt;FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION to decide what it sells. 

No it's not!  It's *censorship*, not freedom of expression.  It's restricting the intellectual freedom of others.  In what world is it considered freedom of expression to impose a campus-wide ban on selling ideologically unsound reading material?

Playing him in the holding role put our defense under much more pressure than when Lucas played.

I think that if Lucas can stay fit enough for say 25/30 games, with Can learning the position, that will make a huge difference.

Plus we're getting linked with Clyne very consistently, who would be a massive upgrade on any RB we have, both defensively and offensively.

I think that they'll keep Skrtel one more year, judge Ilori and Lovren on that, and possibly let him go with a replacement next summer. I love Skrtel, I think he's been our most consistent defender the last two seasons, but he's not getting any younger, and he'll lose whatever pace he had over the next couple of seasons.

Ideally I think next summer our CBs will be Sakho, Lovren (confident and on form), Ilori (again, with either a PL league loan under his belt or some first team matches in the cups) and a new CB to replace Skrtel.

I started into a AD&amp;D 1st edition game and I love it. It's definitely a learning experience and I'm trying to take in as much as I can about the mechanics. We have a had a bit of disruption in the group from people not being able to make it to new members joining. Our DM has said the game will be better once everyone is there which makes me excited to keep playing. 

Speaking of the DM, he's been genuinely fantastic. Very welcoming and patient, explains what happening, really makes it easy to play and get involved. He takes time to answer any of the quest I have and gives updates on our FB group which is great. Plus he's a friendly guy making it easier to come back each week and play! 

There are only two negatives I've had:

 One was a new member who joined. They spent more time playing what looked to be soduku on their phone and didn't follow the narrative, they werent really involved in what was going on. Maybe they didn't really have an interest in playing, but it kind of ruined a bit of the experience that night. 


Second is the dice. They have not been kind to me!

CB: Do we go for a young defender like Stones or ready made like Miranda/Hummels TYPE player who would be world class and come straight in for Cahill?


CM: Like others have said I do feel we lack someone who charges through the midfield with control (we have Ramires but he lacks control and finesse) Veratti-esque players, but I do not know any, you guys might. Box to Box.


LM/RM: There are certain names being thrown around, such as Douglas Costa, Griezmaan, I feel we should try for the latter as we really do need a Marquee signing, and I think he would be as close to a Marquee signing as we could get. Douglas Costa well I will not comment as I have not seen enough of him.



Striker: Falcao, Ibra, Higuain, we have Costa and Remy, Any of those would be nice, but obviously if we could get Ibra then he would be a shirt seller and a great asset as we could play a different kind of football if things weren't working out. Maybe Luis Adriano, he scored 9 in the CL this year, although 5 were in one match.



ABOVE ALL: We need a marquee signing.

Its not like they have campus security looking for people on campus corridors in shady jackets whispering to people going ""psstt hey kid, wanna buy a copy of The Sun"". 

The Sun hasn't been banned as a publication, they have just decided they won't be planning to sell it anymore in their own merchandising venues. The university works for its students - they make decisions because they want what the students want. It's not censorship if the university is deciding by its own volition what it wants to sell.

Here's a hypothetical - say I decided to set up a lemonade stall. I COULD sell limeade as well, however I fucking hate limeade, I think it is vile stuff, so I decide not to sell it - not for any economical reason, hell if I sold limeade it may be quite profitable, I just don't like it and think its existence is morally wrong (I am a member of a secret cult that believes limes are sacred and should not be pressed into juice form - look its a silly example, bare with me here) and don't want my business to be about it. Am I censoring the freedom of those who prefer limeade over lemonade?

If there is a student on the campus who really wants a copy of The Sun, they have the choice of going to a shop that isn't a university sponsor, and they can bring that copy of The Sun onto campus, and hell, go to a fellow student and sell that copy of The Sun. No-one is stopping them doing that. The campus store has the freedom not to stock The Sun, and the customer has the choice to disagree with the campus' policy and shop somewhere else as a result.

If anything is authoritarian, it is suggesting that an organisation should be forced to be a platform for values it doesn't wish to hold.

EDIT: tl;dr the only party the university is censoring is themselves, as everyone else has the freedom to disregard the university's position.

He looks to sustainable success and not just spending money for the sake of it. That means making sure the players stay as much as you can and knowing when to sell for the best price.

He's very hard on mangers but fair apparently. Wants the best. Like when Adkins was replaced by Pochettino. I thought Adkins was doing a good job but then Pochettino took them to the next level.

Pochettino handed in his resignation when Cortese left but then decided to see out the season.

I think he'd stop the nonsense transfer fees and be more like Levy when it comes to buying and selling.

Lallana and Lovern for more or less €50 million was mad money last year. There'd be no more of that.

null,false,theartofrolling,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridgeshire,null,"Lord Paddick absolutely nailed it here:

&gt;We on these Benches are as concerned about the harm caused by people misusing drugs as the Government and the Labour Party are. We believe that there should be a health-based approach, aimed at reducing harm caused by drug misuse, rather than a legalistic approach that is likely to further criminalise drug users. Successive Governments have gradually eroded the link between criminal penalties and the harm caused by drugs by ignoring the scientific evidence and the advice that they have been given, to the extent that the drug laws in the UK are no longer considered by many people to have any credibility. The Bill, by failing to differentiate between dangerous psychoactive substances and those that are harmless, and by criminalising the production and supply of these substances but allowing simple possession, adds to that confusion and further undermines the credibility of UK drug laws.

&gt;As drafted, the Bill is far too broad and indiscriminate, further undermining credibility and efficacy in reducing harm. Legal minds far greater than mine have speculated on whether producing and supplying scented roses, or perfumes that evoke a sense of well-being or romance, could be illegal under the Bill. Those who claim that simply sniffing such substances falls outside the scope of the Bill clearly need to go back to school to learn some simple biology and chemistry. If you sniff something, you are inhaling it; you are taking molecules into your system, exactly as described in the Bill.

&gt;As drafted, the Bill would not outlaw simple possession of new psychoactive substances that come on to the market, which could potentially be far more toxic than drugs currently listed as class A under the Misuse of Drugs Act. The Government may well reply—I think that the Minister alluded to this in his opening remarks—that if that is the case, they could be temporarily banned and then designated as controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act. That course is available to the Government now, without the need for the Bill. My understanding was that the whole purpose of the Bill was to get away from manufacturers constantly changing the formula of psychoactive substances to avoid a drug being banned, yet it does not criminalise possession of what are potentially very dangerous drugs, which could quite easily change in formula in the way that the Bill is designed to eradicate. Either the Government want to send a very strong message that these substances are dangerous, which they may or may not be—in which case, why is possession not a criminal offence?—or they want to say, “Well, actually, these drugs are not as dangerous as controlled drugs”, when in fact they may well be.

&gt;As the Bill allows possession of new psychoactive substances while possession of drugs controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act is a criminal offence, the police will be faced with situations that make enforcement very difficult, if not impossible. If the police suspect that I have EX-1, a synthetic imitator of real ecstasy—I hasten to add that an internet search taught me that—in my possession for my own use, the Bill does not give the power for the police to stop, search or arrest me because to possess the substance will not be a criminal offence. However, if the police suspect that I have a real ecstasy tablet in my possession, they can stop, search and arrest me because it is a controlled drug. How are the police going to know? Some will say, “They will assume that it is a controlled drug, and search and arrest you anyway”. So what if I tell the officer that I have nothing illegal on me, that the tablet is indeed a legal EX-1, that they have no grounds to search and arrest me and that if they do, I will sue them? What if the tablet turns out to be legal to possess? Where does that leave the police? What if the police officer backs off because of my assurances, but the ecstasy tablet that I have is in fact a real one? The Bill, quite clearly, has not been thought through in terms of its practical application.

&gt;At the moment, I can buy legal highs from a head shop on the high street. It is acknowledged in the briefing given by the Government on the Bill that, contrary to what the Minister said in his introduction, many of these head shops are well run, with those that manage them being very keen to comply with the law. At the very least, I can be pretty sure that what I am buying is not a dangerously addictive class A drug.

&gt;If things go badly wrong once I have taken a legal high purchased from one of these head shops, someone can go back to the head shop where I bought it and at least have some idea of what I have taken, and action could be taken to ensure that others are not similarly affected.

&gt;Many people buy legal highs now. They like what they do to them, and their use is increasing. If the Bill passes, the only way they can get psychoactive substances and be sure that they are not breaking the law is to go to a local drug dealer. Many of these street dealers have no incentive to ensure the quality of the drugs that they sell, because they could just disappear overnight if things go wrong. The chances of tracing and establishing what drug I had actually been given, were things to go badly wrong, would be much lower.

&gt;These drug dealers could just as easily sell me highly addictive class A drugs, and indeed they may have a vested interest in misleading me by giving me a highly addictive class A drug instead of the legal high that I asked for; the high is likely to be greater, and if I get addicted, I could become a regular client. It would make no difference to the dealer, if he were to be caught, whether he was supplying controlled drugs or other psychoactive substances—a long term in prison would await.

&gt;We are likely to criminalise many more people as a consequence. If you order psychoactive substances online—we have heard evidence this afternoon about how Irish online sites closed down with the introduction of their legislation—the chances are that the website you are ordering from will be based abroad. Even if you are buying psychoactive substances only for your own personal use, you will be guilty of the criminal offence of importing drugs. If you buy a few tablets to share with your mates on a night out, again you will be guilty of a criminal offence. A lot more people are going to end up with a criminal record as a result of the Bill, even if their primary intention is just to consume the drugs themselves.

&gt;The genie is out of the bottle. Many people take legal highs, and they will continue to get hold of them one way or another—whether head shops disappear from the high street or not—or they will simply switch to far more dangerous controlled drugs. The reason that millions of people break the law by taking controlled drugs is that, quite rightly, they see that our drug laws lack credibility. I have never heard a discussion among young people about to go on a night out as to which class a particular drug belongs to, and therefore which drug they are going to take on that basis. The Bill, as currently drafted, as I have said, further undermines the credibility of the drug laws in this country.

&gt;We need a new approach: a health-based approach that will genuinely reduce the harm caused by drug misuse and that has credibility among those who misuse drugs, not just an approach that appears to have credibility among politicians who do not really know what they are talking about. We need a system that differentiates between the psychoactive substances that cause most harm and those that are relatively safe—at least as safe as smoking tobacco or drinking alcohol—and we should control and regulate the supply of those relatively safe substances as we do with tobacco and alcohol. To do anything else would lack credibility, particularly in the eyes of young people.

&gt;If someone is caught in possession of harmful psychoactive drugs for their own use, controlled or otherwise, and they are a social user, they should have their drugs seized and be placed on an education programme. If someone is caught in possession of harmful psychoactive drugs, controlled or otherwise, and that person is addicted, they should be placed on a rehabilitation programme. If they refuse to co-operate, they should be given a civil fine. Such an approach would be much simpler and far more effective in dealing with this problem than giving thousands of young people a criminal record that could ruin their life chances because they made stupid mistake.

&gt;It is time that we started treating those who misuse drugs as victims of drug dealers rather than as criminals. It is time that we confronted the fact that criminalising young people for possessing substances only as harmful—or less harmful—than alcohol or tobacco lacks credibility.

&gt;Lord Tunnicliffe (Lab): For the avoidance of doubt, is the noble Lord saying that the Liberal Democrats so oppose the essence of the Bill that they will either vote against it or propose wrecking amendments?

&gt;Lord Paddick: My Lords, we do not propose to wreck the Bill. Clearly, we cannot allow head shops to continue operating as they do now—purporting to sell substances that are harmless when they are far from harmless, or trying to get around the law by saying in very small print on the back of the substances that they are not fit for human consumption. However, the dangers in the Bill as drafted are to make the drug laws even more of a laughing stock than they are currently.",null,0,null,1433931999,null,0,false,0,cs1msnj,null,t3_39a01r,null,t1_cs1msnj,null,t3_39a01r,null,null,null,1437562391,null,135,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,135,null

null,false,AlgizOthila,null,null,null,"**History.** Same reason that, you as an American, are not British.

The Republic of Ireland, or ""the South"" as we call it, declared independence from the United Kingdom/British Empire, in (arguably) 1919. Two years later, in 1921, under the terms of the Government of Ireland Act (aka 4th Home Rule bill), Ireland was divided into two parts, the sex North-Eastern counties were to become ""Northern Ireland"", while the remainder were to become ""Southern Ireland"". However, Home Rule was never properly enacted in ""the South"", which resulted in the Irish War of Independence. To bring and end to hostilities the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed establishing the Irish Free State (aka The Republic).

Why should anyone else care? How would you feel if people went around legitimately believing that America is just a part of, say, Canada? It's about national identity - which is why people here are so sensitive about it. That is not to say every single person, everywhere should know about the difference between NI and Ireland, but it's generally considered a good idea if you research a country before going there or attempting to talk about it, wouldn't you think?

In so saying, there are two main communities here, Republican and Unionist. Those who identify as Republican usually believe that the counties that make up Northern Ireland should join the Republic - creating a single Ireland. Those who identify as Unionist usually believe that things should stay the way they are, with Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom.

Both sides have valid cultural, religious, political and economic reasons defending their side, however, most people, except extremist Republicans, are comfortable with the status-quo.

Ulster-Scots is as ""made up"" as any other language. In the same way the Mexican language is derivative of Spanish, Ulster-Scots is a derivative of English. Specifically dialects spoken in Ulster and Scotland. Simply given a formalised status.

Why should anyone move anywhere if they consider that place their home? And has been their home for generations.

I think that's a poor model of what a university is for.  Universities are not intended to make students feel safe or happy or contented.  Students are not the same as customers who must be placated, lest they take their pounds to another shop.  

In large part, contemporary universities exist to promote an atmosphere of intellectual enquiry.  They're also places in which students hope to learn from the best minds.  But this process is not intended to promote student comfort or safety.  The opposite in fact.  Students are expected to be confronted with ideas which *challenge* them.  They are also meant to be learning how to deal intellectually with ideas they disagree with.  

&gt;If there is a student on the campus who really wants a copy of The Sun, they have the choice of going to a shop that isn't a university sponsor

OK, but why the hell can't they also buy it on campus?  Why the hell should a campus shop be making decisions about what is or isn't ideologically acceptable reading material?  How is it OK that the newsagent down the road allows more ideological freedom than a campus store?  

Universities are not your safe space.  They're not your little retreat from the harsh realities of the external world.  

&gt;If anything is authoritarian, it is suggesting that an organisation should be forced to be a platform for values it doesn't wish to hold.

The idea that a campus store should promote the correct ideological values and that these values should be reflected in the literature it allows its customers to buy is fantastically wrongheaded, if not  outright dangerous.  It's nothing more than an argument for censorship.  Go down this path and the only thing left on offer will be views which either reflect majority political opinion or those ideas which offend absolutely nobody.

If you bag it up and take it to a bank, they can take a long time to weigh and check each one. Take some spares as they can weigh a little bit under. You are often left with a pile after that if you can't find 100 pennies to fit in a bag.

Some banks have a coin counting machine - perfect, but you may need to have an account with them.

Supermarkets have machines which change coins but they charge a percentage. So for every tenner they will charge 70p. If you can deal with that it takes all the hassle out of it if the bank is not an option. 

Self serve machines in supermarkets can be a good way of using it up. Take a fistful at a time, then pay the remainder by card. 

Whatever you do which involves a human will make them pissed off to be honest. Whatever you do will be an inconvenience, I stopped bothering saving pennies a while ago.

5. I don't have anything else on finance and don't plan on buying anything on finance.

null,false,interiorlittlevenice,null,null,null,"The use of 'state capitalism' bothers me for two principle reasons.  The first is that it provides a convenient excuse for socialists to blame all the attempts at achieving socialism in the 20th century on some twisted form of capitalism instead of the corruption of many an ardent Marxist, or indeed the many flaws of socialism in practice.   The second is a semantic objection.  If the government owns all property then it is not 'privately' owned.  And if the government is nominally owned by the people, then *technically*, so are the means of production, which means that the country is socialist.  

A few words by Lenin in his final regrets on his deathbed hardly changes that.  And tour argument doesn't make sense anyway- Russia had not been strictly feudal since the emancipation of the serfs more than fifty years prior.   Indeed, Capitalism was well on its way in the Russia of 1917, and industrialisation was inevitable.  Hell, if the country had stayed capitalist, its lucrative exports to Europe and America may well have funded industrialisation quicker, and with less suffering, than Stalin's own program.

That's strange, I was under the impression that Students were paying the university £9000 a year to the university in exchange for a service? Not that this point matters, because the campus store isn't part of that service, it's simply something the university runs on the side to generate extra revenue (which I should clarify isn't paid for by the taxpayer, in case you were worried). 

No student's union has demanded that course organisers change the content of their courses to fit the SU's worldview. You do get the occasional radical student who storms out of a lecture theatre because their politics professor is teaching about right-wing movements, but those students are rightly considered to be twats by the majority of the student body, and the university would never back down when it comes to the education aspect.

There is no movement to censor ideas in the context of the university classroom, don't worry...

&gt; OK, but why the hell can't they also buy it on campus? Why the hell should a campus shop be making decisions about what is or isn't ideologically acceptable reading material? How is it OK that the newsagent down the road allows more ideological freedom than a campus store?

For the same reason that the newsagent down the road could decide to stop stocking, say, The Guardian, for example. Because a store can stock whatever the fuck it likes. If people don't like that, then they don't shop in that store, simple as. If I don't want to sell something, I have the legal and moral right not to sell it. You can't force me to stock up and sell something. Again, I don't get how this is any different to a vegan store not stocking meat.

Stores don't have a duty, either legal or moral, to be impartial, in the same way that the papers themselves don't have a duty to be impartial. Are you suggesting we should make a law that forces all organisations to be absolutely impartial in the values it supports?

&gt;  these values should be reflected in the literature it allows its customers to buy is fantastically wrongheaded

You seem to be confused, the store's customers are allowed to buy whatever the fuck they want. The customers aren't banned from the store if the store finds out the customer once bought a copy of The Sun. The only thing is that if the customer wants to buy a copy of The Sun, the store won't have it in stock, and they'll have to get their copy of The Sun from elsewhere.

As another example, should I be morally outraged if a book store doesn't happen to stock a copy of a very specific book?t  Because if so you are basically suggesting that every book store should be legally required to stock every book ever, a policy which you will find would collapse most small businesses... By your logic, any restriction on stock is an attack on freedom of thought. Stores have to prioritise what they order in stock, and they base that decision based on what would be most acceptable to their customers. You would be hard-pressed to find a Waterstones stocking a copy of Mein Kampf.",null,0,null,1433933792,null,0,1433934192,0,cs1n8q7,null,t3_3955dp,null,t1_cs1n8q7,null,t1_cs1mwgg,null,null,null,1436871917,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Think Bolasie clearly has talent but he just strikes me as a completely frustrating player to have playing for your club.

Goes from making the defender marking him look like a fool one moment to punting a ball into the stands while trying to pass backwards the next moment. You never seem like you know which version of him you would get moment by moment.

Given how frustrated people get watching Lamela and Townsend i think that Bolasie would just become the newest outlet for people to bitch about.

Education costs money, but it would be missing the point to view it in consumerist terms.  The relationship between universities and students is not simply that of a store to its customers.

&gt;There is no movement to censor ideas in the context of the university classroom, don't worry...

Except that academics are coming under increasing scrutiny for what they say in the classroom.  Banning The Sun may seem disconnected to academic freedom within the lecture-hall, but I think it still feeds into the same dangerous attitudes - namely the idea that students should have a right to decide which ideas are ideologically acceptable for others to hold.

&gt;For the same reason that the newsagent down the road could decide to stop stocking, say, The Guardian, for example. Because a store can stock whatever the fuck it likes. If people don't like that, then they don't shop in that store, 

We've been through this before.  I keep challenging you on the concept of intellectual freedom and you keep responding with the true, but vacuous, claim that they have a legal right to do what they want.  

Yes, a store has a legal right to restrict what they consider to be ideologically improper reading material.  But I think it should still concern us when that happens.  Why?  Because one day it could be *your* ideas, or books and newspapers which *you* want to read which are being restricted or censored.  

&gt;You seem to be confused, the store's customers are allowed to buy whatever the fuck they want. 

...from a selection of ideologically approved reading material.  

&gt;The only thing is that if the customer wants to buy a copy of The Sun, the store won't have it in stock, and they'll have to get their copy of The Sun from elsewhere.

Right.  Because it's been banned from sale.  Because a group of student busy-bodies have think that they should get to decide what reading material other people should or shouldn't be able to purchase on campus.

It is true that academics are coming under increasing pressure to be impartial in what they teach yes - because not being impartial in their delivery could suggest the university isn't promoting critical thinking. It is not true they are being pressured to only teach a left-wing view.

&gt;We've been through this before. I keep challenging you on the concept of intellectual freedom and you keep responding with the true, but vacuous, claim that they have a legal right to do what they want.

I very carefully specified, that its not just a legal right, but a moral right. Freedom of expression allows them to choose what values they wish to be a platform for.

&gt;Because one day it could be your ideas, or books and newspapers which you want to read which are being restricted or censored.

And if they do, I will take my business elsewhere, along with other people with my view. The beauty in the way our society works is that if I don't have a stake in the business, I don't have to give a shit about them. I would be morally outraged if it were an outlet owned by the government, as I would be paying taxes towards it, and thus a de facto stake holder, but in this case I'm not, so I don't have to care. For the record, the Student's Union is a stakeholder of the university (as in they actually own shares in the university) by all definitions, so they are allowed to be morally outraged by the university's decisions.

The customer's rights are not being restricted by a store's decision not to have something in stock. I'm not about to go to a Vegan store and start complaining about them trying to shove vegan values down my throat by not stocking meat.

Put that one straight into bridge mode - modem-only - and connect it over Ethernet into your Asus router, let that do the heavy lifting.

Fortunately in my experience, Virgin make this easier than Plusnet, there's a setting in the SuperHub web configuration (when you log in as admin) to make it reboot into bridge mode.

For the Blairites, it suits them to shape the debate as ‘either you go with us, and we're successful, or you go back to the 40s with insane Marxist rhetoric that hates aspiration and progress’.  And for us lefties, we're often guilty of ‘either you move forwards with a full anti-austerity agenda, or you go back to the dark days of Blair and Iraq and NHS privatisation’.

The thing is, if they parked on fields and left them clean and tidy, maybe if they even did some litter picking or various other things for the communities and green spaces, people would simply not be able to sustain their hatred. It would be great positive publicity, attitudes to them would change, hell, they could even specifically target run down areas and be seen as a voluntary force for good. They could post some leaflets thanking the community for accomodating them even. There is absolutely nothing inherently wrong with having no fixed address (well, if we don't go into the taxation side of it...).

But they don't treat the places they stay well at all. The last time I lived near a temporary encampment, they left gas bottles, mountains of litter, shitted-in nappies, and all sorts of detritus all over the field they had used. it is extremely different to turn the other cheek towards such, well, cheek.

* The principal spoke about the academic success of the school, being all like ""This month, 40% of our students got A grades, we have risen in the league table 4 places!"", treating students as nothing more than business statistics. Just looking at their website, they still seem to pulling this shit despite changing their leadership: ""Our academic performance is consistently high.  In 2014, 66% of students achieved 5 or more good passes at GCSE including English and Maths.  At A level 50% of grades were at A*/B.  This level of success is down to the hard work of our students and their teachers.""

* They heavily encouraged people to choose business courses - essentially teaching the idea that jobs in big business = good, other jobs = bad. Hell I just looked at the school's website to see if they changed, and the first thing on the front page is a large banner for their business courses.

* We were made to take part in a school prayer even if we weren't Christian

* My RS teacher was biased towards the homophobic church view when teaching

* History promoted the British successes of the empire and didn't even speak about the bad parts

* Sex ed didn't even cover the fact that homosexuals exist



Aside from that, there was absolutely no actual teaching about politics at all. I was politically unaware until my second year at university -  I didn't know who any of the political parties are, only that the Tories held the ideology that seemed to coincide most with what my school pushed (not surprising since the school is based in Michael Grove's constituency and is considered his baby (it became one of the first schools to volunteer to be an academy)).

I am now incredibly left-wing - and that's despite my education, not because of it.

(As an aside, apparently my school recently ran a mock election in which UKIP won, though there was no Conservative party in the mock election..... some completely made up party came up second, Labour 3rd, then Green 4th)",null,0,null,1433937924,null,0,false,0,cs1ogwh,null,t3_39a0eo,null,t1_cs1ogwh,null,t1_cs1mnbc,null,null,null,1436872848,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

null,false,istara,australia,Australia,null,"Of course much of the ""harm to others"" for certain drugs is due to it being illegal (thus high street prices, theft, violence etc) however this harm wouldn't be entirely eliminated by decriminalisation or even legalisation.

I guess the thing that I would want to see is it not costing the health service more.  So long as some kind of tax was imposed, sufficient to mop up the damage caused by drug users, and to drug users (eg rehab costs), then the situation probably wouldn't be worse than it is now.

I would also, regardless of how decriminalisation proceeds, like to see compensation sought from drunk people for the cost borne to emergency services. Those that can afford it should be fined or forced to pay some kind of fee for using emergency services due to excessive alcohol consumption.  Obviously the dirt poor wouldn't be able to be fined, but they get off most fines anyway or pay a minimal amount (I've been in court and seen someone have an another 50p docked from their weekly benefits to pay some crime or other).

Then finally I would want employers to have the right to terminate drug addicts, certainly those incapable of performing their duties. I don't want to reach a stage where we create ""legalised self-induced disabilities"" that the employer has to pay for.  The same goes for booze. 

Ultimately there needs to be an understanding that if people don't want a ""nanny state"": if they want the freedom to take whatever substance they like, then *that goes hand-in-hand with the responsibility of managing their own sobriety*.

null,false,APOPO_Robin,null,null,null,"&gt; B) alcohol consumption reduces the incidence of heart and blood conditions to the point that you have to be drinking quite a lot to have the negative effects (on longevity) overtake those of the ones you erase by drinking. This leads to the infamous j-shape curve where risk of mortality decreases if you (as a statistical member of the population) drink at all, giving maximum benefit somewhere about the UK maximum daily guidelines (not how they are calculated I don't think) and then the detriment starts increasing so overall benefit declines until you get to zero benefit (giving you the same risk of mortality as a t-totaller) at some outrageous amount. The number varies by study but I've seen it as high as the units in a standard bottle of wine a day. then obviously if you drink more it (risk f death in micromorts) skyrockets up very quickly. So actually alcohol has some pretty impressive benefits even to the people who think the aim of life is to live a long life.

I'm skeptical of many of these studies, they sound just like the crap the tobacco industry put out years ago. The drinks lobby is powerful and have friends in the media because if their giant advertising spend. Note the next time you see a study warning about the dangers of alcohol and I near guarantee that within hours there will be numerous stories about how alcohol is good for you.

I think with the players we have now, we play our best football when we have multiple players with good, aggressive, forward movement running in front of our midfield (especially in front of Coutinho).  The creativity in our midfield is really more transition based, we struggle immensely to break down opposition that's had time to get it's defensive shape and pack themselves in.

-----------------------

You walk into a supermarket and go over to the drug counter. They have expanded somewhat in recent years; it used to be just cigarettes, but since a number of other drugs were legalized, some room has had to be made. The market used to be flooded with 'legal highs' but people stick to the established ones nowadays. There is no need to buy little known, untested and inferior products. You ask the cashier for cocaine.

The cashier asks for your ID, and you hand it over. On the ground is a weighing scale, and on the ceiling is a device which measures your height. Cocaine is one of the drugs sold on the basis of an automatic body mass calculation. Trying to deceive the scale with weights in pockets is as illegal as using false ID to buy booze. They slide open the shutter doors originally introduced to hide cigarettes from curious young eyes. There are small boxes, unbranded like the cigarettes, with cocaine doses available in a few sizes. S, M, L, XL. The cashier chooses the appropriate one and hands it over.

Only one can be bought at once, with a few lines in each. It's not a deterrent to the sufficiently determined, but most people won't bother trawling around every corner shop in a several mile radius.

When you take the box home and open it, the lines are encapsulated like tablets in their own long, thin indentations. A leaflet recommends the time to be left between taking doses, explains the health hazards, has contact information for addiction help, and explains how a dosage should be insufflated (half a line in each nostril, obvs.). Also provided is a short disposable plastic straw. 20% of its price is tax, same as alcohol and other drugs. It isn't cheap, but cheaper than it was when the market was controlled by criminals, and it's produced in industrial quantities to regulated standards in the UK. You know that none of the money you spent was used to murder Colombians with machetes.

There also seems to be something different about the quality of the MDMA used. I'm not sure how the testing works tbh. When a pill is 200mg MD and 100mg filler, is it 200mg of 100% pure MDMA or does the test for what parts of the pill are MD also count the impurities?

* Because women are not capable of full citizenship, for the simple reason that they are not available for purposes of national and Imperial defence.   All government rests ultimately on force, to which women, owing to physical, moral and social reasons, are not capable of contributing.
  
* Because there is little doubt that the vast majority of women have no desire for the vote.
  
* Because the acquirement of the Parliamentary vote would logically involve admission to Parliament itself, and to all Government offices.   It is scarcely possible to imagine a woman being Minister for War, and yet the principles of the Suffragettes involve that and many similar absurdities.
  
* Because the United Kingdom is not an isolated state, but the administrative and governing centre of a system of colonies and also of dependencies.   The effect of introducing a large female ele­ment into the Imperial electorate would undoubtedly be to weaken the centre of power in the eyes of these dependent millions.
  
* Because past legislation in Parliament shows that the interests of women are perfectly safe in the hands of men.
  
* Because Woman Suffrage is based on the idea of the equality of the sexes, and tends to establish those competitive relations which will destroy chivalrous consideration.
  
* Because women have at present a vast indirect influence through their menfolk on the politics of this country.
  
* Because the physical nature of women unfits them for direct com­petition with men.

I imagine most insurance companies will invalidate all policies with any consumption of anything involved, so that may deter some.

The idea is Sturridge would play slightly deeper to pick up knock downs from Benteke, and drive at defenses with his skill and speed. He would also have license to drift wide if it called for it, as he's capable of creating too. 

Coutinho would move central to play in Sturridge and Benteke, as well as pop off some trademark longs shots. He would be covered by Milner or Moreno pushing wide to add the width.

Lucas would protect the defense and have the engines of Milner and Henderson to help both attack and defense.

Sterling takes Sturridge's place and plays as a more wide player to deliver more to Benteke. He would have license to cut in too.

&gt;Suarez doesn't win a penalty for Gerrard to convert if Coutinho doesn't give him a pinpoint through ball. One player can have a MASSIVE impact, but that doesn't eliminate the fact that it's a team sport.

He completely abandoned it for this past season even though it was/is something that's still well suited to the players he had to work with.

I said in my post that I think our players are best suited for the diamond.  However, not all formations are equal at all.  Changing the team's shape directly changes how the team is able to approach the game.  This past season BR tried to shove players into the formation he prefers, he went back to his original ethos, which is a number of variations of the 4-3-3 that try to emphasize overwhelming possession play (which often, but not always, means slower build up and a more controlled approach).  It took him until January to come around and try something that suits his players a bit better rather than stuff a bunch of square pegs into round holes.

null,false,JilaX,null,null,null,"&gt;BR dislikes the diamond though, he strongly prefers a 1 striker setup and he's been quite vocal about that preference pretty much since he became Liverpool manager. The only reason we played the diamond in 13/14 was because Suarez and Sturridge were so good that it would've been absolutely fucking criminal to force one of them out of position or drop one of them.

And it's fucking dumb, as only one of our strikers are capable of playing alone up top. If he had a squad more suited for the formations Brendan wants to play, than maye it would work a tad better. But, his immense stubbornness in this area, is one of the things that truly make me question his competence. 

Hopefully the new Backroom staff will slap Brendan around on the topic, but we'll see. 

&gt;I think with the players we have now, we play our best football when we have multiple players with good, aggressive, forward movement running in front of our midfield (especially in front of Coutinho). The creativity in our midfield is really more transition based, we struggle immensely to break down opposition that's had time to get it's defensive shape and pack themselves in. I really like the 4-4-2 diamond because of how lethal it is in transition and I personally really hope we see a return to that style in the coming season. Both Ings and Milner fit this formation extremely well too, so that's a nice little positive.

He then finally changed things for a couple of months and actually tailored the setup to the players, which immediately brought us good results.

I have tried the ""mould your own"" kits, anecdotally at least, they were not that great.

Two main problems...

1. Getting the putty far enough into my ear for a decent seal and ""hold"" was difficult and required a second attempt. The result was still unsatisfactory for me.

2. Following the instructions that came with the kit meant that the plugs also filled a fairly large part of the ""cup"" of my ear. This made getting a helmet on and off without unsettling the plugs nearly impossible. I was never able to achieve as good a seal as I do with foam plugs.

Your milage may vary though, I have big ears for one thing...

For £10 a kit may be worth a try.

I suspect that getting an impression done by a professional would address some of the issues I had however I'm not convinced that a silicone plug will produce as good a seal as expanding foam. This is somewhat supported by the fairly modest noise reduction stated on their website.

I noticed that the silicone plugs do not respond well to being disturbed at all, they may provide adequate sealing under ideal conditions but i found that moving my jaw, or helmet caused the seal to fail. In other words, they are not as tolerant to movement as properly fitted foam plugs.

Having said that, the reason I wanted to try silicone plugs was that they are much, much more convenient to put in and take out so that may be a compromise you are willing to make.

And they'll either fail to ban all potential legal highs or ban a whole load of other totally harmless things without a gigantic whitelist (that will almost certainly not be complete, and end up with stupid things being illegal).

I mean, it certainly doesn't fill you with confidence in their abilities when you read this thing. That ""hard-working"" patter for instance. What halfwit drafted that? 

I don't know why I'm potentially helping with laws I fundamentally disagree with but I don't understand why they don't bring in analogue laws that other countries have (the US is one example). All this ""legal high"" stuff never really kicked off too much in the US (the drugs did, but they weren't/aren't legal) because they were already illegal. Methylone was a big one, aka bk-MDMA. It was illegal in the US before it was invented as it's a beta ketone analogue of MDMA (sorry if my pharmacology is wildly incorrect, I'm no expert). 

That's how they skirt the laws. You ban bk-MDMA and they make bc-MDMA (I just made that up) then you ban that so they make bb-MDMA.

These scriptures dictate rules that are, largely, in contrast to the culture and indeed laws of other societies / nations. So it's understandable not only from a community, but also a theocratic and cultural sense that you seem very segregated Muslim communities where they will feel more comfortable practicing their faith.

Now it goes without saying that this does not apply to all Muslims and not all of them are hostile. The problems arise when they decide to take Islamist, or indeed extreme approach to beliefs, Anjem Chaudry is an example of the former, Bin Laden the latter. 

The good news is that more and more people are throwing away their religion and becoming more secular / humanist, particularly in the West with children of immigrants. Islam does indeed seem to be more difficult to break away from, which I attribute to the totalitarian nature of it, but as this documentary shows, there are very brave people doing just this.

null,false,MaesterWeasel,null,null,null,"&gt; it was/is something that's still well suited to the players he had to work with.

It wasn't for the most important part of that formation - forwards. Every single one of our available strikers was out of form or just unsuitable for our other players. We started the season with thoughts to play Sturridge and Balotelli or Lambert together up front. It was only in case Sturridge was fit. He gets in behind and makes some use of more static forward. We tried the diamond with Borini and Balotelli vs West Ham away. Borini tried to play the role of Sturridge but the partnership wasn't just good enough. We tried almost every single striker combination available. We only didn't try Balotelli - Lambert partnership but that wouldn't have worked for obvious reasons.

You're bringing out 4-3-3 as if it's a formation where we can only play one striker, we used it with SAS before going to diamond and we played some of the best football I've seen us play in years. We have played numerous games with 4-3-3 in the past with two strikers. Sturridge and Suarez, Aspas and Sturridge. They changed positions with each other and weren't traditional wingers. 

&gt; This past season BR tried to shove players into the formation he prefers, he went back to his original ethos, which is a number of variations of the 4-3-3 that try to emphasize overwhelming possession play

I think you're misinterpreting our lack of ability to create chances with possession play. Our two of the better strikers were absolutely static. No movement to create space. Some brought out Newcastle away as a game where we went full possession play. You have to just take a look at Balotellis average position to understand how deep he sits. And he was our best choice at the time! Look at it: http://www.liverpoolfc.com/fixtures2014/first-team/newcastle-v-liverpool-8246/opta-match-stats. He's lower than Coutinho!

&gt; It took him until January to come around and try something that suits his players a bit better rather than stuff a bunch of square pegs into round holes.

You can't just shove a foreign formation upon players, it's not that easy. You use a formation with which you've practiced in the training. As Rodgers said they had so much less time to try anything else in training last season and that's why they couldn't just change everything right away. We had 2 games a week from October to February. Add players struggling with form and fitness and it's clear why we had hard time finding something that works better with what we had.

&gt; And then, after a few months, when teams had adjusted to the new setup, he went back to square pegs/round holes rather than try for something else that suits the players.

We didn't have wingbacks or a defensive midfielder to continue playing that way. Markovic lost form, Ibe was injured and lost his form after that, Moreno was underperforming. The key parts of that formation were not working. We couldn't have continued playing that way, especially with results going worse and our main threats losing form. We used Sterling as a striker but his form became just horrible from one point on. We had to change things around.",null,0,null,1433943076,null,0,false,0,cs1ql4b,null,t3_39addr,null,t1_cs1ql4b,null,t1_cs1pg6r,null,null,null,1436874202,null,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

The amounts of nicotine in the air would be far to low to have any impact (even with strong nicotine levels in the liquid) particularly given other chemicals in the air at any given public place especially near to roads.

The ecig I use gives off a very low cloud, and I use a very low nicotine content (I was a 20 a day smoker until quite recently). Things will be different with vaporisers that are designed to give off as much cloud as possible, but they are likely to contain very low levels of nicotine if any (there is weird subculture of people who enjoy this). 

The point is that ecigs and cigarettes are very different and shouldn't really be treated the same. Passive smoking is a huge problem, and I fully supported the ban on indoor smoking even though I smoked myself. The effects of passive vaping are insignificant, especially compared with all the other things in the air we are constantly and unavoidably exposed to. While I really only use my vaporiser outside anyway, i'm concerned with legislative proposals that lump ecigs and cigarettes together and a failure to tackle the view held by many that ecgis and tobacco are equivalent.

Empirical evidence is important in economics, but you simply can not simply pull out causation out of a single variable; you can't even do that in hard sciences. Infact there is an entire economic school dedicated to theory and where no empiricism is used; just logical argument. That's how much debate there is in economics.

The other thing you need to realise is that because of this lack of clear methodology, you end up with wild differences in opinion. You guys probably saw Cambridge in the title and thought 'damn if they say this then it must be fact!' but that is just not true when it comes to economics. Cambridge will undoubtedly be full of Neo-Keynesians as this has always been popular in the UK and is encouraged by the government. They MIGHT be right; but it is nowhere near as simple as an issue as hard science issues that involve clear and logical applications of statistics and pure mathematics. You can go to any university and no doubt you will get disagreements in the general policies advocated.

Don't get me wrong; I'm not criticising economics. The shortcomings in its methodology are as a consequence of the topic being studied and not because 'dumb people go into economics'.

The OO pay the bands to accompany them. Most band parades have no OO involvement at all.

&gt;isnt that like saying you're in the KKK but not a racist?

Not really. The OO is sectarian in nature because it is a protestant organisation for protestants. Most members as far as I can tell aren't religious, don't follow OO guidelines and certainly don't go about 'hating' catholics.

&gt; where was this?

In the North West.

&gt;imagine the GAA existed to say ""fuck prods"", and only catholics 
&gt; could play, would it be feasible to insist it carries cultural value to &gt; the population at large and should be shown respect accordingly?

I don't disagree. Respect needs to be earned. I think rather than totally discard orangism we should be helping and encouraging it to become something we all find acceptable, by removing the elements that make it unpalatable to ordinary folk.

I think Derry is more than tongue biting. There has been a lot of effort on all sides over the years to engage and work through their problems, and it seems that they have. My understanding is that the contentious parades centered around the city walls and I think both sides recognise that this must be considered a shared space and respected accordingly. Lessons can be learned I'm sure.

&gt; sounds lovely

The sham fight is generally just a bit of craic. All in all it's a fairly laid back day.

It goes on to reassure the constituent that access to communication data is subject to stringent safeguards.

Indeed, but it's still odd that after braving bullets/ starvation/ etc., people are so ready to ensure their children and family then suffer the long-term effects of dissociation because they refuse to adapt to where they've moved to.

&gt;I think the fundamental point that most people miss out on is that most people aren't moving here to ""become British"" and integrate and drink tea and whatever else that means.

I'm not so sure it's a point people miss, because it's generally regarded as something an immigrant has no control over in the first place - I'd suggest most people would agree that anyone moving to live here has to acknowledge that while they might not moving here to be 'become British', that's exactly what's going to happen regardless (the onus being 'so why pretend otherwise?').

Put it this way. Your mortgage contract is more than likely to have a clause about letting out your property and it no longer being your residence. If they find out, you could be properly shafted legally and financially.

I suggest you talk to your mortgage provider and see if you can negotiate something. I assume you've owned the place for a while so you didn't originally intend to ""buy-to-let"". Your lender may be willing to sign a ""consent to let"" agreement. If not, you could always take your business elsewhere.

They are very common though... other than bunk pills you get in clubs, I can't remember the last time I heard of anyone getting anything other than the strong ones (UPS/TripAdvisor etc). Our neighbours were trying to sell us Rolls Royce pills on the weekend, just looked them up and they're also 200mg.

&gt; There also seems to be something different about the quality of the MDMA used. I'm not sure how the testing works tbh. When a pill is 200mg MD and 100mg filler, is it 200mg of 100% pure MDMA or does the test for what parts of the pill are MD also count the impurities? (I don't expect you to know that lol, just explaining why I'm unsure about these ""200mg super pill"" tests).

When they're lab tested, impurities won't count towards the amount of MDMA, so yes that's 200mg of pure (84%) MDMA.

&gt; I was only a child in the early nineties but if the ""You paid £20 for one and that was you flying until 6am"" sort of stories are to be believed then those pills were either stronger or of a far higher quality than just about anything about today.

Supposedly indeed. St Andrews held a referendum to rejoin the NUS a couple of years ago (which was defeated by something like 2:1).

Of course, what they didn't do was account for the fact that the Union was already a part of a buying association, and were thus benefiting from savings.

null,false,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,null,"From 2008 onwards, Labour should have taken an anti-austerity rhetoric. They should have full-heartedly argued that they needed continued investment during the recession so that, while the debt and deficit may continue increasing, economic prosperity would be better after a few years. Maybe it would have meant they'd lose the 2010 election by a bigger margin, but at least it would mean they have a consistent, and more importantly different, ideological base. 

However, they seemingly copy-pasted Tory policies and rhetoric, and just put 'but not as harshly' on the end. They aren't offering an alternative, just more of the same, so people who are on the fence are more likely to vote Tory just because they actually seem to follow through on their ideology, and not just piggy-back on the opposition. 

And the sad thing is it seems Labour are already gearing up to do exactly the same throughout this next Parliament: to take Tory policies and propose just not doing them as harshly.

null,false,fenderstrat86,null,null,null,"Yeah moreno has made mistakes. He's young. Also 3 at the back makes the wing back's job quite difficult as they push up and then need to hurry back to cover. I think the jury is still out on him in a back four.

Yeah, 4 strikers for 1 spot is a problem. I don't know where Origi fits tbh. But agreed that is a draw back.

Re CAMs being played out of position - 3 up front can be quite versatile, with one pulling in (more centrally as a full back or midfielder overlaps) and the other pushing out wide to stretch the play. So it wouldn't be quite like having two wingers.

Lucas - well if he can't be relied on he needs to go, I thought he did well when he was on last season, and a full (injury free) preseason might make a difference.

I suppose the problem I see is this:
If you have Coutinho in behind the striker, then if you still want to have two central midfielders in the side (choose 2: Can, Henderson, Milner) then it's difficult to keep a spot for a DM infront of the defence - unless you move to a diamond.
But the problem with the diamond is that then you lose the wide players in the team - which I just can't see happening.

null,false,Tolosan,null,null,null,"I'm no expert on 19th century Britain but I think this perspective might be an oversimplification. After all, for the first half of the nineteenth century, the Corn Laws were still in effect (repealed in the mid-1840s), and Britain was very protectionist. Britain didn't really commit to free trade until the 1840s and 1850s, when it was already the most economically powerful nation in the world.

I also think focusing on free trade as the basis for Britain's economic success is also missing the real underlying drivers, which were the massive technological shifts and the existence of an empire from which raw goods could be very effectively extracted (and then the goods manufactured sold back to the empire). Let's take a later example: by the 1870s onwards, and certainly by the 1890s, Germany and especially the United States were outcompeting the British, despite the United States having very high tariffs at this time. If Britain's success was due to free trade (and let's not forget, the paragraph you quoted above has a lot of the impressive statistics being from the first half the 19th when Britain was still protectionist), why did the protectionist United States outcompete Britain in the late 19th century? 

I'm also going to ask a few things about your point further down about nationalised industries. You say that the money gets spent on other departments rather than on R&amp;D. Do you not feel that this is an oversimplification? After all, you'd probably object if I just stated that in the case of private ownership all that happens is that money goes off in profits. If state run companies are so inefficient, why are we having to get the French state-run firm, EDF, to build our nuclear plants at exorbitant cost? Shouldn't privatisation and liberalisation of our energy sector have had private companies clamouring to build those plants at lower cost, rather than our present situation where we no longer have the expertise to do so?

Don't get me wrong, I think national industries are appropriate in some situations and not others - I would agree with you for things like British Leyland, where there is no such thing as a natural monopoly and there can be meaningful competition between providers. Energy and the national grid, though, not so much.

EDIT: Additionally, citing the 1970s as the inevitable result of government intervention seems a bit simple. It's like me saying that the Great Depression was evidence that the free market never works. The Great Depression's causes were quite complicated, but the major cause was the Gold Standard.

In my experience, all the providers I've dealt with have been fine about it (for a fee), but I only have experience of a couple of mortgage providers.

If it's a flat, I'd guess it's a leasehold? If that's the case, the freeholder will probably also have to give their permission, which can also incur a fee. In my (again, very limited experience) one private freeholder charges me a 10-yearly fee of a few hundred pounds, and one freeholder which is the local council didn't charge me any fee at all.

You also asked about income tax. You'll need to declare this, and fill in a tax return. You can deduct all expenses from your rental income, including the cost of the interest on your mortgage, but **not** including the cost of the capital repayments on your mortgage. Then you pay tax on the rest, at whatever tax band you are in taking your salary into account. I'm not sure how a foreign salary would contribute to that, but this can be a bit of a killer if your capital repayments are high, because you have to pay tax on an amount which is considerably more than what you bank each month.

He was able to have his vote once the session had resumed that afternoon and he lost.**

Perhaps a further tl;dr - UKIP wanted to kick up a fuss and this (slightly edited) video tries to show them doing so, but misses quite a bit of context.

The Parliament was supposed to be debating and voting on a report on TTIP. There's a lot of public opposition to TTIP, but the powers that be (including the Conservative and Labour parties in the UK) quite like it.

As there were over a hundred amendments to be moved on this report the President of the Parliament postponed the vote by sending it back to the relevant committee (which he has the power to do - although he was accused of abusing his power, postponing it because he was worried he might lose the vote). Given that the vote was postponed until next month (probably), there was a vote to postpone the debate on the report as well (which kind of makes sense). The centre parties voted in favour of this, the outer parties against (UKIP, Greens etc.). The vote to postpone the debate passed by a long way - that's the vote at the beginning of the video.

After this the chair suspended the sitting until 12pm when the main votes would take place (this was just a procedural vote at 8am to change the agenda), Steven Woolfe then got up to try to make a motion under the rules to suspend the whole plenary session (the week of votes), as a symbol of how annoyed the Parliament was at being messed around with. But the chair dismisses him on the basis that the Parliament wasn't sitting (it had already been suspended until later).

When the session resumed, the chair allowed the motion, and it was defeated (by a long way) and the business went on.

The key issue seems to be that Woolfe may have tried to submit his motion *before* the morning session was suspended, but didn't get a chance, which might be his fault, or the fault of the chair.",null,0,null,1433946159,null,0,false,0,cs1s93v,null,t3_39ae8g,null,t1_cs1s93v,null,t1_cs1qtdh,null,null,null,1436875352,null,34,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,34,null

It's so stupid that this is happening at all!

Our archaic drug laws are thanks in no small part to America's ridiculous drug war and even the Yanks are now starting to back down.

It's time to start legalising drugs that are as or less harmful than alcohol and tobacco (not decriminalise, *legalise*) so that people can have the drug they want without having to deal with shady drug dealers and run the risk of their lives being destroyed.

People wouldn't be risking it on 'legal highs' if they could get the real deal legally. And legalising things like Ecstasy means they can be regulated and mass produced, rather than cooked up by a shady mother fucker in a dirty kitchen using whatever he has lying around.

Bear in mind that many of the specialists now running these localised market economies have no skills set or CV in this line of work and responsibility. 

So now more time and money is needed to put things back in a way they used to be and worked, not perfectly this is true,  but when your kit car you built runs a little rough you don't strip it to bits and build a different car do you. 

38% of the population are clearly happy with this kind of NHS management. All of us can expect more of the same for the next five years.

Labour should have nailed this blunder to the mast in the election campaign but they failed miserably to show the public what had happened behind closed doors in the previous five years, which was a massive own goal.

The diamond would also work, playing Lucas, Henderson, Milner, Coutinho as DM/CM/CM/AM behind Sturridge and Ings/Sterling but this would be a really narrow formation and puts a lot of pressure on our fullbacks.

A number of players can also slot into those roles; Ibe could play LW or RW in a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3, Markovic as RW, LW or potentially AM in all of them, Lallana the same. Coutinho in a way is actually probably the most likely to miss out, as he is best and can only really play AM, or at best a very attacking central midfielder.

while i agree benteke is not the option we need, im not 100% sure vietto will be the right fit either. stylistically yes, but he is a guy that is also young, foreign and will take some time to bed in. we have ings and origi to start the season (assuming all of our strikers are sold) and if we add vietto, that's 3 guys 22 or younger. vietto is a very very promising talent and i wouldn't be upset signing him in the slightest, i just wonder if there is a different option since we now have two ""project"" strikers in ings and origi. 

douglas costa would be another foreign guy, but the brazilian/ilori presence could help him bed in pretty easily i would think and he is a proven goalscorer across europe. the guy i believe is ALSO on a free. 

douglas costa, vietto, tevez, rondon, soriano from red bull could be shrewd, aubamayeng...i don't know what's in our wheelhouse of reality, but my hope is that we can sign someone who can just put the ball in the net. i don't know that they need to be super mobile because BR is going to have to change the system once more, but that's a bonus, and would allow us to look at guys like das bost, meier, benteke..

so anyways, vietto would be fantastic, but he's young like the rest of our strike force and would be another ""gamble"" which our fans don't want. i also have this crazy feeling that balotelli will end up staying, and actualy have a decent season. i for one have been super disappointed with balo, but not really about his attitude, just that his stint has been poor. he obviously has the talent to turn it around and if we end up retaining him and use him as a second striker rather than the out and out 9, he could be very useful. ings and origi should get a lot of time between them, and i am hopefully sturridge can come back healthy around october to start being slowly reintroduced to our side. super sub appearances until the november months is my guess. if BR reverts back to a 4-3-3 the backline will consists of migs as gk obviously, moreno, sahko, skrtel/lovren and hopefully clyne or manquillo...the mid will be a combo of milner/hendo/coutinho, milner/hendo/allen, lucas/hendo/milner or lucas/milner/coutinho...(granted we don't sign kovacic, which i would be ecstatic about) and the front 3 should consits of any combo of sterling/sturridge/ibe/marko/ings/origi/balo/coutinho

edit: sorry /r/djsexpanther i realized i went on an entire rant :) point being, again, vietto is a great player, im just worried he wouldn't deliver right away. if we sign him, i hope im wrong. and if he's really worth the reported 12-15m, we should bite their hands off",null,0,null,1433948171,null,0,false,0,cs1tgyj,null,t3_398o9d,null,t1_cs1tgyj,null,t1_cs1irme,null,null,null,1436876222,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

One thing we also have to consider that we prepared for the season in a certain way and Sturridge was certainly in the middle of it. In a hindsight not a great plan as Sturridge hasn't been that reliable with injuries but that was more our transfer failure's fault. I think we tried to pair Lambert and Sturridge together in training and according to Rodgers they worked very well together. That pairing was certainly in question. When Sturridge got injured I don't think we wanted to change things around instantly as being without him should've been a temporary, one-month thing. I believe we completely gave up on Sturridge when we started to go onto the 3-4-3 formation. 

The first time we tried a formation that was something like the 3-4-3 was away against Newcastle. We lost 1:0 and I'd say it was our worst performance of the season chance creation wise. It just didn't work with Balotelli (brought out the same game's avrg position for him before). After a month and a half later we tried it again against Manchester United away but with Raheem as the striker. We were much better in that game although we lost 3:0. After that we didn't look back. 

But it gave me some timeframe - I think (just completely speculating) that we started to try that new formation couple of weeks before Newcastle but as we had some big games after it we were not encouraged to use it again after such a bad game. After a month and a half we looked pretty comfortable in that system - so 2 months for completely changing things around seems believable? Again, I'm just guessing as I don't know how exactly coaching stuff works at top level while playing two games a week.

if we were forced to pay 10m for a guy who scored 11 goals for a relegation side that played a very tight defensive formation, thus restricting the amount of times he would be exposed to the ball (sean dyche was fully in relegation battle from december on), what could he do when exposed to a team that tries to play an expansive attacking game, one which i believe suits his style because he's a guy that like to play the ball on the ground and is mobile. 

also keep in mind, guys like shane long cost 12m for southampton, saido berahino is valued around 20m (who im not convinced is that much better). someone like pelle cost a shade under 10m and im not convinced he's a much better player than ings...so in perspective that would be market value for a guy of his production level...but throw on top that he is 22 and english, if he has one or two decent seasons where he can score 10-15 goals, his value will skyrocket to somewhere closer to 20m which makes him valuable for resell if that becomes an option. anyways, his tribunal fee will be much closer to the 5-6m with bonus add-ons. sturridge's fee was around that when he went to chelsea, and he was at city's academy since he was 8. ings has been with burnley since he was 18 and was signed from bournmouth for 1m.
