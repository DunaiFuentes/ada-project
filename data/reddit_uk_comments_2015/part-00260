Yes there is an excess, but given the absolute numbers aren't known and even in relative terms its two-fold, rather than ten-fold. One would have to do a statistical analysis to see if this is massively significant.

Regardless, is massively different to the whole 30%/3% business discussed in this thread which I believe is based on severe recessive problems.

There are quite a few center backs as good as Terry, some are even better. Silva, Boateng, Godin, etc.

There's a real lack of quality defensive midfielders at the moment but nevertheless I don't think Matic is world class quite yet. If I was making a list, he would be world class by default, with Busquets and Mascherano (when he plays there) being ahead of him, but that's not how I define it. Schneiderlin played as good as Matic did last season and I don't think he's world class. 

&gt; Hazard?

A case can be made for him either way, in order for him to be a certainty like Courtois he needs to increase his output to match the likes of Ribery and Neymar, we'll ignore Ronaldo cause he's a freak. 

&gt; Costa who got 20 goals in his first, injury-filled season in the BPL and 36 goals for Atletico Madrid the season before that?

If diversity is strength, then how did Japan become the world's superpower and the second wealthiest country on the planet with zero natural resources? How come their cars and electronics are #1 in the world? They have zero diversity. According to politicians, they should be dirt poor and have zero culture, yet somehow Japan's non-existing culture is being emulated all around the world. China is beating us all in exports having zero diversity. United States dominated the 20th century being 90% white with not nearly as much diversity as people think. Every European power got wealthy without anyone telling them that they're not diverse enough. No one is going around Africa or Asia or any other non-European land saying diversity is strength and you must import other countries. This is all just nonsense.  
I want Britain to remain British. Having the country divided into half Muslims half Christians, as an example, would just breed conflict. Muslims have their own piece of land, and we have ours. I'm sure a majority Muslim country wouldn't be too happy if we started importing a million poor Christians into their land every year. Why the double standard? A country is more united and a democracy much stronger when people are more like each other. Norway, Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Japan, South Korea are best examples of this.  
Every group of people shall live within their own borders under whatever economic and political system, and culture that they wish. This is a natural right that all people should have. If all that makes me a racist then everyone in the world is a racist so that word just becomes meaningless.

null,false,gin0clock,null,null,null,"As of today, I don't want Sterling at Liverpool anymore. I was completely indifferent before, he could stay or go, I'm not bothered. But the straw that's broken the camel's back has been today.

As I've said on this sub before, Sterling earns roughly 5 times more in a week than I do in a year (got a better paid job in September though, so that's good) and despite the fact I'm on pretty much the legal minimum anyone in the UK earns, no matter how I feel (went in with a horrendous chest infection in February which left me unable to talk for a week or two, but I left when prompted by my boss), I go to work. If I'm told by my boss to go home, then I do, but I make the effort. It's not about the money, its about being professional in a working environment and not letting those around you down. 

I can forgive the fact Sterling might want to leave for more trophies, to play with better players maybe, whatever, it's only football. But to me, employment's something that everyone should take pride in. Footballers, builders, teachers, doctors, supermarket assistants, everyone. By deciding he was too ill, despite being on an absolutely absurd amount of money for his age (I don't care how good he is, £35,000 per week is too much for any 20 year old) he's slapped every hard-working, humble, honest Liverpool fan in the face and in my opinion it speaks volumes about his character.

If you're embroiled in controversy at work, potentially in trouble with your superiors, you confront it. You go in with your chest held high and you defend your motives or actions. Sterling's been a complete coward and this mystery illness is him trying to wriggle his way out of the pre-season tour. If he's too ill to go on tour, he's too ill for a medical at another club surely. 

Maybe I'm over-reacting, but when I read about Sterling this morning my blood completely boiled. I'm a year and a half older than Sterling.

Parks, gyms, swimming pool all in 15/20 min walk too.

Lochend castle barns themselves are ok, they're likely cheaper than the average in the city for similar sized newish builds so you can expect a higher amount of foreign immigrants and younger people but I've no idea if you'd view that as a bad thing or a good thing.

Nearby parts of lochend and restalrig are deprived, there's no arguing that. But you could pay a fortune to live in morningside and be next to deprived areas in oxgangs so unless you have a spare million pound, you're going to be living near a deprived area.

&gt;

&gt;Nearby [Chelsea Football Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.) has been affiliated with the Chelsea Pensioners for many years; the club's first nickname was the *Pensioners* and until the 1950s the club crest featured a Chelsea pensioner. Residents of the Hospital can be seen attending Chelsea's home games at [Stamford Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium\)). 

&gt;When Chelsea won the [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) title in [2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004-05_in_English_football), Chelsea pensioners formed a [guard of honour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_of_honour) as the players and management came out for the trophy presentation. This was done again when Chelsea won the title in 2010.  In tribute to the trademark red coats worn by the pensioners, Chelsea's kit for the [2010-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_Chelsea_F.C._season) season featured a red trim on the collars.

If diversity is strength, then how did Japan become the world's superpower and the second wealthiest country on the planet with zero natural resources? How come their cars and electronics are #1 in the world? They have zero diversity. According to politicians, they should be dirt poor and have zero culture, yet somehow Japan's non-existing culture is being emulated all around the world. China is beating us all in exports having zero diversity. 

Japan has 127 million people, while we have 67 million. Japan is richer for so many more factors. Correlation is not causation. Otherwise, you could say Japan and China are rich, therefore people born Asian are more likely to make more money based soley on that fact. It's illogical.

&gt;  According to politicians, they should be dirt poor and have zero culture, 

Which politicians?

&gt; Every European power got wealthy without anyone telling them that they're not diverse enough.

Countries got wealthy. This has nothing to do with how diverse they are or aren't.

&gt;  Having the country divided into half Muslims half Christians, as an example, would just breed conflict.

No. People being assholes will cause conflict. People can happily live with different ideals. White people beat the shit out of white people all the time.

Following your example, what about athiests? Is there no room for atheists? If you say yes, so athiests and Christians? Surely that's a bad thing. It could cause conflict.

&gt; I want Britain to remain British. Having the country divided into half Muslims half Christians, as an example, would just breed conflict. Muslims have their own piece of land, and we have ours. I'm sure a majority Muslim country wouldn't be too happy if we started importing a million poor Christians into their land every year. Why the double standard? A country is more united and a democracy much stronger when people are more like each other. Norway, Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Japan, South Korea are best examples of this.

Erm. Except have you never heard of the British Empire? We invaded almost 90% of the world. That's an incredible number. And in the last decade we've invaded Islamic countries several times. So yes, we do move our people in. See America for a prime example, or Africa, or India. 

&gt;  want Britain to remain British. 

British. Fish and Chips… Nope, that's Belgium. Curry, Indian. Pizza, Italian. Most things we love have been borrowed from other people. 30% of us have German origins thanks to the invading Vikings. 

&gt; Every group of people shall live within their own borders under whatever economic and political system, and culture that they wish. This is a natural right that all people should have. 

This is not an excuse for being fearful because people are different. And we've not respected this very well (again, see British Empire.) 

&gt; If all that makes me a racist then everyone in the world is a racist so that word just becomes meaningless.

No. That's a fallacy. You're speaking on behalf of everyone in the world and obviously lack the ability to do so. Not everyone thinks this. 

&gt; People arguing for diversity say that all the time. Look up arguments for diversity and you'll get those same points. This has nothing to do with UKIP.

So because some people agree, it's false? That makes zero logical sense. That's like saying ""many people agree there is a god, therefore it must be true."" 

It has everything to do with UKIP. Nationalism for the sake of nationalism is bad. 

I'm going to quote another Reddit user, /u/uniklas:
&gt; To best sum up how I feel about nationalism, and thing that goes with it national pride, I'll need to cite Arthur Schopenhauer
&gt;&gt; The cheapest form of pride is national pride; for the man affected therewith betrays a want of individual qualities of which he might be proud, since he would not otherwise resort to that which he shares with so many millions. The man who possesses outstanding personal qualities will rather see most clearly the faults of his own nation, for he has them constantly before his eyes. But every miserable fool, who has nothing in the world whereof he could be proud, resorts finally to being proud of the very nation to which he belongs. In this he finds compensation and is now ready and thankful to defend, … all the faults and follies peculiar to it.
&gt;
&gt; As I personally feel, is that you can't take pride in things that you had little part in achieving. Just as you should not feel smug (I know there is a better word for this) because your parents (or grandparents or whatever as long as it is not you yourself) bought you a better car than everyone else, you should not take personal pride of a country that you just happen to be born into by chance.

UKIP would bite off their own nose, or the UK's nose for that matter, to get rid of other races. That is their goal.

You can only have one race, while you can claim multiple ethnic affiliations. You can identify ethnically as Irish and Polish, but you have to be essentially either black or white. The fundamental difference is that race is socially imposed and hierarchical. There is an inequality built into the system. Furthermore, you have no control over your race; it's how you're perceived by others. For example, I have a friend who was born in Korea to Korean parents, but as an infant, she was adopted by an Italian family in Italy. Ethnically, she feels Italian: she eats Italian food, she speaks Italian, she knows Italian history and culture. She knows nothing about Korean history and culture. But when she comes to the United States, she's treated racially as Asian.

&gt; Dave is solid defensively but is hampered going forward on that side. To be world class you need to be able solid at both

I guess we all judge players differently but I don't think it's fair to judge Dave on his attacking ability when his role in the team requires him to sit back. Personally i think they should be judged at how good they are at their job rather than how they match with an ideal perfect fullback. I agree that alaba is the best in the world but he plays more midfield than left back nowadays, similar to how you mentioned lahm.

1) Big multinationals exist in a world alongside SMEs.  Tax credits and subsidies exist in other formats to SMEs too but don't make headlines because it doesn't have that emotive ""twang"" that people at the Guardian, Telegraph, etc. want which brings in revenue for them.  For example, small and medium firms receive far better research tax credit rates than large firms and, until recently, paid lower rates of corp. tax.

2) You're right.  In my example Nissan isn't opening a factory in Sunderland out of empathy for the local people.  You know what?  The newly employed workers, their families and the resultant community don't (or shouldn't) care.  Improved quality of life is improved quality of life.  If Mr. Evil Billionaire invests millions in helping orphans in Africa because the good PR will increase profits of his companies then who really gives a shit.  Good has come from it regardless.

To touch on another good point you made - big companies do get to experience a 'free rider' scenario on good quality public services &amp; infrastructure in the UK.

      20.0% * £88.0K (corporation tax)
    +  0.0% * £ 5.0K (dividend tax free allowance)
    +  7.5% * £26.0K (dividend tax up to new £43K HRT)
    + 32.5% * £39.4K (dividend tax on remaining income above HRT)
    = £17.6K + £2.0K + £12.8K = £32.4K

give or take the odd bit of income tax on salary and some rounding.

The differences in thresholds don't make that much difference from where we are today, but the shift from an effective 0% rate to 7.5% between the £5K running out and the higher rate threshold and then from 25% to 32.5% above the HRT makes a difference of several percent to the effective total tax rate.

How do your figures differ from this?

Guzan: regains his confidence. Hopefully he plays well with the USA and begins to get his presence and instinct back. I'm happy with Guzan as the man between the posts for us.

Defense: I would love to see three centre backs because I think that Richards has the ability to play in the middle but can move wide if needed. Clark or Okore in the middle, and Clark or Baker playing on the left side. I know Richards has the strength to play inside, and Baker and Clark have experience as both centre and wide backs. 

Midfield: I think with Gueye coming in, we have massive potential for central midfield. Hopefully we hang on to Delph, and can play Sanchez as DM, Delph and Gueye just ahead of him, with one of Gil, Grealish, Sinclair or Bacuna playing behind the striker (AM/#10 role). 

Wings: we have all the talent we need here. Gil, Sinclair, Grealish and Bacuna can all play on the wings, although in my mind, Bacuna and Sinclair are the best options because they both have the ability to go box to box and help defend as wing backs.

Striker: Benteke.

This all works out to a general 5-4-1/3-4-3 mixed formation. I'm on mobile so the formatting may be fucked but...

            Guzan

     Richards-Clark-Baker

            Sanchez

        Gueye    Delph

           Grealish

    Bacuna Benteke Sinclair

With Bacuna and Sinclair moving all down the wings.

One of the benefits of this formation is that is extremely adaptable. Grealish can switch with either of the wingers, and Bacuna could go back to full back to switch the shape up. 

Gardener, Okore and Kozak would all be awesome subs too. 

My fear with this formation is that Benteke will not get the support he needs. If Benteke is too lonely up front, I think Sherwood should experiment with playing Benteke and Kozak together. Although they are probably not the best suited duo (best case would be Benteke with Austin just ahead of him) but it would be interesting to see Benteke (with his flick-ons and hold up play) with a proper target man ahead of him. 

It would probably look like:

            Richards-Clark-Baker

        Bacuna-Gueye-Delph-Sinclair

                 Grealish

              Benteke-Kozak 

Hopefully we can bring in some squad players to rotate in. Austin would also be my final ideal transfer. A young sub keeper would be awesome too.

The farmers want the foxes killed, and the hunters want to kill foxes. Most of the hunters are bored old people with too much time and money who do it for the social aspect and for the excitement of galloping around in the fresh air on a frosty morning.

- The idea is that increasing fees increased what a graduate pays, and reduces what the Government pays.

- The loan repayments are set at quite a low level, but the increase in tuition fees has meant that the loans themselves are quite big (easily £30-50k). Some graduates are literally paying £5/month, I was in this position for a year. Barely makes a dent in the interest.

- Because the loans get written off after 30 years, the government can lose money on an individual loan (cost of servicing a loan, amount taken from taxpayers to fund the loan in the first place vs what a graduate actually pays back).

- The government assumed that a certain number of graduates would pay their loans back in full. They always knew that some people would not (low earning jobs, underemployment, disability, raising a family, etc).

- The government realised that because the loans were bigger but the repayment requirements had actually gone *down* (the threshold for starting repayment is higher), actually lots of people wouldn't pay their loans back in full before they get written off. 

- With the previous £3k tuition fee level, people were more likely to pay everything off (simple maths, if I lend you £12k you will pay it back more quickly than if I lend you £27k, if I only allow you to make the same repayments in both scenarios). This was counteracted by the fact that the government had to pay additional money upfront which they *knew* they wouldn't get back from anyone. So they assumed that charging £9k per year would get more money back, even knowing that many people wouldn't pay all of it back before it was written off.

- The calculations turned out to be a lot closer to the knuckle than people thought. 45% of people are currently estimated to have part of their loans written off - originally the govt thought this would only be 28%.

- An independent body worked out that if 49% of students had part of their loan written off, it would have been cheaper to charge everyone £3k per year instead of £9k (don't ask me how they did the maths, but the govt hasn't disputed the figure, it seems likely it's accurate).

- Now, 45% of people can't pay off the loan at its current level. The government wants to add £12-16k to the loan in taking away the grant. They will save some money in not providing the grant, but even more people are not going to pay their loan back in full. Again simple maths, if I give 100 people £30k and 45% can't pay that back in full over 30 years, it stands to reason that if I give the same 100 people £42k instead, extra people would struggle to repay in full - the people who'd squeaked in and only just managed to pay £30k off in the time available.

Harmon's been preparing for the usual standard Con cuts everywhere, and has now had to fend off a budget that's almost more left-wing than her party is right now.  It's not a case of Labour incompetence, it's a case of Osborne's trickiness.

What's scary is the support it takes from the Labour's working class roots.  They should have been the ones to introduce the ""living wage"", they should have been the ones being progressive, but as Osborne started reeling off the progressive policies the Conservatives have historically implemented, you could see how much they were trying to appeal to the working class.

And it'll work, if the SNP and Labour don't buck their ideas up and start driving the discussion about these things.  Labour at the moment have the barest of margins in terms of visible working class representation, and continually talk about benefits, when the reality is that working class voters don't want charity, they want to be able to work for proper money.  Now the Conservatives are offering that as if they were the ones who wanted that all along, and if they're allowed to continue telling us that they wanted it all along, they're going to start convincing people that maybe they do have working class interests at heart.  And in one swoop (plus a few smaller swoops that we'll no doubt see in the next few months), goodbye to a scary amount of Labour's heartland support.

the 'matches' and subsequent relationships in those communities are probably or at least, just as fucked up as 'matches' and individuals that occur and exist outside of that culture. the culture of arranged marriages is largely just about blindly propagating that same culture, it's designed to be resistant to change.

Your country is going bankrupt now, and your solution is to replace all the native British people with third world people because they ""work hard"" and they have better food, and are just overall better...  A country once proud of itself, now feels inferior to everything and everyone. This is exactly what Ted was talking about. This is going to be a sad page for the history books, and somehow you all feel proud of it.  
No, a country divided by such forces as religion will only cause problems. Different people of different cultural groups always come into conflict. History shows this over and over again. Multiculturalism in the US isn't as pretty as you see on TV. Over the last 10 years it has gotten worse, and it's slowly going to get even worse especially as third world immigration is only increasing, ask anyone. Just look at what one group says about the other:  
&gt; Go back to Simi Valley, you skunks! Go back to Woodland Hills! Go back to Boston! Go back to the Plymouth Rock, Pilgrims! Get out! We are the future. You're old and tired. Go on. We have beaten you; leave like beaten rats.

Yeah, what do you think is going to happen in the next 20 years? This is Britain's future too, except they'll be using the colonial excuse.

You mean the country we invaded? They're not being pushed on us, we pushed ourselves on them.

&gt; And then you beat yourself up for your colonial past when any other equally powerful nation would have done exactly the same if not worse.

I'm not beating myself up about it. Our heritage is literally steeped in other people's heritage.

&gt; Your country is going bankrupt now, and your solution is to replace all the native British people with third world people because they ""work hard"" and they have better food, and are just overall better... 

Our country has gone bankrupt in large due to white British bankers. I'd much rather have people who will work hard and provide us with what we need if that's the alternative.

&gt; A country once proud of itself, now feels inferior to everything and everyone. This is exactly what Ted was talking about. This is going to be a sad page for the history books, and somehow you all feel proud of it.

This is it. You hit the nail on the head. People feel inferior, and feel they need someone to blame. And people of other races happen to be it. It was our own faults.

&gt; This is going to be a very sad page for the history books

Yes it is. We'll look back at ourselves as an intolerant society who hated people who worked hard because they made us feel bad about ourselves. 

&gt; No, a country divided by such forces as religion will only cause problems. Different people of different cultural groups always come into conflict.

So what are you saying? That we should all think alike? and we should have a religion chosen for us? Do we stop athiesm? This is all bullshit. Differences are what make us human. If it's not religion, it'll be something else.

&gt; Stop beating yourself up and feeling inferior to everyone. People with that mindset are just sick.

This is in direct conflict with

&gt; A country once proud of itself, now feels inferior to everything and everyone


Look, your logic makes no sense. You've said a lot of words but have proved absolutely no facts. You've suggested hateful things and said it's okay, because you're protecting the country. Different races don't make a bad country, different religions don't make a bad country. Bad people make a bad country.

Our politicians have failed us, not Muslim people. Our banks have fucked us over, not Indian people. We need to fight them, not anyone who happens to be slightly different. And we don't all need to be white christian and exactly the same - that does not help progress. It stifles it. 

You're blaming the wrong people because it's easy. You say you don't like people coming to our country because they ""work hard' and we don't. That's literally stifling progress. That's saying you want people who do a worse job because they're white. The reason our country is fucked is because of people who've done a bad job - the politicians.

&gt;  Multiculturalism in the US isn't as pretty as you see on TV. 
I've lived in America for 5 years, 5 years ago. I know exactly how it is. I've lived in the Midwest and the South. It's mostly a culturally peaceful place. America is literally a land of immigrants so I'm not sure where you're going with this. We all know the Americas were populated by British, French, Dutch, German, Spanish, Portugese, etc. But a lot of the influx of Italians didn't come over until 1900. And mostly, there isn't the same aggression as there is in the States.

The main aggression in the States right now stems from people being treated badly, people being shot by a corrupt system, and people all around being assholes. 

&gt; Over the last 10 years it has gotten worse, and it's slowly going to get even worse especially as third world immigration is only increasing, ask anyone. Just look at what one group says about the other:

Our main cause for concern right now is Isis. And the reason for that is our own antagonisation and invasions. 

&gt; Stop beating yourself up and feeling inferior to everyone. People with that mindset are just sick.

The evidence of the last five years clearly shows you are wrong when you say government is composed of members of one party; there is nothing in the law which states that must be the case. Government is the collection of ministers nominally appointed by Her Majesty. Governments frequently enact changes opposed by the majority of MPs from the party of government, relying on opposition support. My point was that equating the actions of the whole Tory parliamentary cadre with that of the Government isn't correct - although it is somewhat understandable given that Governments typically enact legislative agendas supported by the party to which the majority of ministers belong, for obvious reasons.

null,false,YoungArcher13,missy,Missy,null,"Ok so you have just been introduced to debatably one of the largest and most long-lasting fandoms ever. Welcome to the word of Who. Here's what you need to know. Well.. Ok it's a start. Basically, you watched a stand-alone episode/tv special after season seven of Dr. Who. Assuming you picked up on the basic ideas of the episode, you'll know that those three men were different iterations of The Doctor, who are actually all the same character at different points in his timeline. The one with the frizzy hair and the sonic screwdriver with a blue light was played by David Tennant, who was the 10th doctor, and the one with the bow tie and black hair is Matt Smith (my personal favorite), who played the 11th Doctor. The third one, the old one, is considered the 'War Doctor,' and was actually the original doctor, but has never previously been shown; the doctor who we had always thought of as the first doctor was actually the second, the second pushed to the third, etc. so actually Tennant was the 11th doctor and Smith was the 12th. As I said before, these are all actually the same person. When one doctor dies or is fatally injured, he goes through a process known as regeneration. Basically, he gets a new body, which can be any living thing in the universe, but so far each time has been an adult human male. :P He also usually gets a different Sonic Screwdriver and a new Tardis interior. Those changes are purely aesthetic, but with each new body comes a new personality as well, and the changes in each one are fantastically written into each season and each episode, creating a truly dynamic character. Each doctor also has a companion, or companions, which help him in his daily adventures and often play major parts in each season. I believe all companions so far have been women; at least in the new seasons. Companions and doctors do not come and go at the same time however. Rose Tyler, the first companion in the new seasons, and Clara Oswald, the current companion, have both carried over to a new doctor, and there have been several that have come and gone in between, during Tennant's seasons.  This brings me to another thing about Dr Who- you should know that anything you see them play on TV or wherever are the new seasons. There are currently 8 seasons, with a ninth premiering this fall. Stretched across these 8 (or 9) seasons are four doctors; Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant, Matt Smith, and Peter Capaldi, respectively. And they are doctors 9-12, excluding the exception I discussed earlier... That's confused many people, so most just forget about it. But anyway... Before the ninth doctor, there were 26 seasons, running from 1963-1989, now known as 'Classic Who.' Across these seasons the first eight doctors ruled, as well as their companions, and many of the main or most famous enemies were introduced and still remain today. But seeing as how I don't know much about those, I'll move on to the more current ones. The show was revived officially in 2005, though a movie was released in between. (Not sure on the date.) And this year it was announced that Dr Who would run for at least another five years, so we're safe until at least 2020.  Ok so I'm really sorry to have been talking so much.. if you're still reading this, you're the real mvp. Seriously though, if you want more info, just pm me a question and I'll be happy to answer! I love this stuff. Now, finally, here's what you should watch. I'd suggest watching everything starting at season 1, if you have time. This'll allow you to learn everything you need to know about the doctor, the Tardis, the Sonic Screwdriver, etc. on your own. I left these out intentionally, since it's more fun to learn them on your own and have fun with it. Again, just ask if you need it. If you CAN'T watch every season, (1-8 are on Netflix btw) then at least start with season one and watch that. That'll still give you all the basics you need before advancing to the later seasons. But then I think it's safe to say you can skip 2-4 and start at 5, Smith's first season, and work up to 8. I really don't think you should skip any of the later seasons, starting with 5, and honestly there IS some important info in 2-4, but if you decide to skip those, just let me know and I'll fill you in on what you need to know for now. I'm so glad you're enjoying Doctor Who, and I hope you'll continue to! It's an awesome universe and fandom, and we're always happy to have a new member!

I didn't want to see Pascoe or Marsh go because they're top notch coaches, but if they were really offering no different opinions to Rodgers and left too much to him, then perhaps it was the right decision. But then again, there was no complaint when we came 2nd and had Rodgers, Pascoe and Marsh tinkering behind the scenes so I don't think that's true.

But O'Driscoll and Lijnders are smart coaches and you only have to read what they say to understand that. They'll offer their own perspective and think about things differently which can only help Rodgers. O'Driscoll with his experience but Lijnders has caught my eye, incredibly young but speaks very very well. Surprised Inglethorpe/Beale weren't coming in instead of O'Driscoll to be the other coach to be honest. 

McAllister is clearly going to be the ""Listen up, I've won the lot here"" type of guy. Hopefully that can motivate everyone.

The sense of entitlement that some native Brits have when dealing with the NHS is truly breathtaking to behold; and they are VERY aware of how badly they behave while in hospital some of the time. Seeming to think that it is some kind of healthcare hotel rather than a very busy clinical environment (hint: nurses are there to care for patients, not to be your skivvy.) They see how they treat staff and think to themselves ""do I really want to be treated the way I treat these poor saps?"" And the answer is of course ""no.""

So we have to hire foreign nurses and techs to keep up with demand.

Laying my cards on the table for the wider debate, I have always been a bit uneasy with the ""multiculturalism uber alles"" attitude of recent decades; in which it seems that not only must you live in a multicultural society, but you must also openly LIKE it, and be seen to be liking it and celebrating it.

I can understand why the white British are feeling besieged (even if this NOT in reality the case.) Trevor Phillips himself recently pointed out on a TV documentary how the strategy of shaming white Britons into being ""not racist"" became a patronising echo chamber which majorly backfired.

So it's not that people like me are picking on white Britons. I get it. Believe me, I do.

But for better or for worse, people of differing cultures are here now, and ultimately, we all have to live together on this island. In order to do that we have to learn to treat each other with some civility. That means white Britons accepting that differing cultures are here to stay, and the best way to make a friend of a neighbour is to TALK to them, and extend that hand of friendship. White Britons are guilty of not making enough of an effort to mix with people of different cultures. The differing cultures by the same token need to accept that occasionally some of their more divisive customs might have to be shelved, or at least toned down the greater good (Sorry British Muslims, but hating people because of their differing sexuality is no longer acceptable in this country. Deal with it! And yes, that DOES include shooting them dirty looks in the street.)

North Edinburgh's road network doesn't really have much capacity to add a ton more traffic, so the idea was that a tram would pick up the task of thousands of additional people movements through the city and keep the city running.

Drawback one: with the financial crisis (combined with developers' fixation on building bloody two bedroom luxury flats), the redevelopment sort of stalled.

Drawback two: with Edinburgh council's spectacular management (*cough*) of the tram project, the trams don't actually go anywhere near the waterfront now anyway.  They just more-or-less replicate the airport bus service.

&gt; He could've attempted approaching the media about this in an entirely different fashion other than put Liverpool down and claim there is no way his client will be signing a new contract. 

I don't see how they could have done this in a polite way really.. what they've done so far has pretty much made selling Sterling pretty easy for the club as barely any fans will be complaining about it as most of us hate him. If the club had accepted £50m for him from City in January for example before this had all even started then I think most would have been a bit pissed off.

&gt; Of course agents are dicks, but there are plenty of them whom we never hear about because they're good at their job and keep out of the spotlight.

Maybe, it's just that the real well known ones which most top players are signed to seem to be giant cunts.. maybe that's just a coincidence. I'm sure there are some nice ones.

&gt;This guy has essentially forced Sterling to look like a spoiled little brat because of his comments

Well at first it was the CLUB who made Sterling look like a spoiled brat by leaking the contract negotiations about his agent wanting £150k to ""be on par with Sturridge"". That promoted thousands of Liverpool fans to start the money whore &amp; ""LOL 150K"" comments every time he did something bad in a match. If the club hadn't have done that all of this would never have happened surely, it was just all blown out of proportions with Sterling/Aidy Ward not wanting to back down after being ""humiliated"" by the club I suppose

Several of my colleagues used to bring their home machines into work and use it as a replacement for test equipment. Since they were already familiar with the internals they could quickly write up a basic programme without having to go through the learning curve of new equipment or wrestling with some engineer who was hogging the test labs regular equipment!


Personally I think the BBC is to be commended for continuing this programme and trying to push programming as a basic skill but my only misgiving with this equipment is that it requires a host platform. If the end user has a host platform already then likely they could learn programming on that system instead. The BBC micro was more expensive but was a stand alone item.

Now to put it into perspective? Pakistan and India in 1950's were like Somalia today. No infrastructure, No Education. Nothing. They basically are building at a frightening speed. And this is without taking into account all the Western Interference in Pakistani Politics and their dictators. 

I repeat. The UK had done this in the Industrial Revolution, something that India and Pakistan only began in the 80's and 90's and those still aren't as widespread because the world's changed from a pure industrial economy to a mixed one.

There's also other ways of owning property that this won't have a bearing on. 

At the moment, if you're a higher rate tax payer (45% band), then for every £100 that you're charged in interest, you're actually just paying £55 (100-45) due to the tax break. What the change will mean is that this changes to costing you £80 instead, so the higher rate tax payers are 'losing' £25 per 100. Those on the 40% band are going to lose £20 per 100, and basic rate payers will remain the same.

I don't think it's going to have a huge bearing - I've got a second property and the change is going to mean a cost of around 400 quid a year, so not a big difference in the grand scheme of things.

My understanding is that restaurants proliferated there because of the high population of immigrants in the area, Indian restaurateurs catering to ordinary immigrants.

I would guess that they've just gone out of fashion.

This story seems to contradict itself - it starts by saying Salim’s restaurant (which he bought or opened in 2000 - wasn't that when Brick Lane's trendiness was at about its peak?) is empty, and then it talks about visas for immigrant chefs.

2. He'll be sent to the reserves which will destroy his career and he then fires his agent (this one is a must if he wants to be atleast benched). And then we sell him the next year. 

Even if he runs his whole contract out and we don't sell him, We will get a training fee (Like the one we are going to pay for Ings) which will be huge, maybe around £20 mill if he is still as good by then.

 With schneiderlin their midfield will be bolstered and they will have a legitimate rb. A world class CB, Otamendi or Ramos, would be a massive upgrade over evans and jones. 

If they keep De Gea, which is looking like a possibility, they will have one of the best defenses in the league, again, an improved midfield, and have Di Maria, Mata, Rooney, Depay, and Young in the attack. 

I think City is the most likely team we can jump. They are the oldest squad, with Yaya in decline and Kompany coming off his worst season.

&gt;

&gt;___Bouteloua dactyloides___, commonly known as __Buffalograss__ or __Buffalo Grass__ in North America, is a [prairie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie) [grass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass) native to [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America). It is a shortgrass found mainly on the [high plains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Plains_(United_States\)) and is [co-dominant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-dominance) with [blue grama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_grama) (*B. gracilis*) over most of the [shortgrass prairie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortgrass_prairie). 

&gt;""Buffalo grass"" in North America is not the same species of grass commonly known as 'buffalo' in Australia. It should not be confused with *[Stenotaphrum secundatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotaphrum_secundatum)* varieties such as Sir Walter or Palmetto.

1. I'm noticing a massive lack of sympathy for the children. It can't be great to have completely avoidable disabilities due to the ignorance of your parents. In fact, one of our family friend's is in a first cousin marriage and they have a disabled child. Now it's impossible for me to know whether the disability is due incest, but it most likely is. It's heartbreaking to see their daughter struggle through school and social events because of her disability. This couple aren't even the typical ignorant people you think of, they're doctors. 

2. I think banning first cousin marriage is enough, and the DNA tests are excessive. Forced DNA tests before marriage are ridiculous.

Also, Schneiderlin may not fancy having to compete for playing time with Schweinsteiger as well as Carrick, especially in the run-up to Euro 2016.

Of course, Woolwich could come back in for him, but then again they may not.  And Southampton might be grumpy from the Toby saga.  And Levy may not want to pay 27m (though, if there is one player he should pay the premium for, it's Poch's golden boy).

However, I am kind of done lobbing the blame at this feet. He did have a huge hand at the beginning of this, but anymore how can you look at Sterling and have this be a tale of caution and manipulation?

There are plenty of players throughout history that have worked with an asshole of an agent and gave them the boot. Look at Berahino seeing that Ward is kind of a parasite and giving him the boot.

I hate to say Sterling is way less than bright, but I am not sure how you can manage otherwise. He has dug himself into a giant hole, and his solution is digging himself deeper and deeper. There is something to be said for being a young and talented player that wants to go to the next level and win and earn more. But there is more to it than that. A lot of players that go from young players to superstars also take a HUGE step in going from immature, bratty kids to true professionals. He IS a kid. I get that, but if he doesn't want to be treated like a kid and wants to honestly be included in the same conversations as other 40 million+ players, he needs a fucking reality check. 

I don't begrudge him for going to City. He can fuck right off, but that is his decision. I just want no excuses or sob-stories in the next three years that he or the City PR team put out about him being manipulated by a big, bad agent. This is getting to be his doing, and instead of taking responsibility or acting like he wants to be treated, he is being a petulant baby.

null,false,Andyl66,null,null,null,"I honestly can’t see it getting through parliament in a free vote.  50 years ago fox hunting was seen by pretty much everyone as a necessary thing.  People kept chickens back then, even my parents kept chickens, we didn’t eat them but they were a good source of eggs.  The times the foxes came were pretty bad, a fox wouldn’t just make off with one hen, it’d pretty much murder any hen it could get it’s teeth and claws into.  Foxes are extremely clever too.  One time a fox came along, grabbed a chicken then stood right by our beehives (my parents kept bees too).  My dad had his gun out to shoot the fox, but the fox just sat by the beehives and looked at him as if to say ‘yeah, shoot me here and you’re fucked mate’! 
 
Times have changed.  People no longer keep chickens In their gardens.  Farmers built huge secure chicken rearing factories that no fox could ever get into.  So, there is no livestock to protect anymore.  If you look at where the big hunts now take place the farms are all turned over to rape seed production.  Hunting is now nothing more than a ‘sport’, and a sport where an animal that faces more than enough problems is murdered at the end. 
 
You can listen to Jeremy Clarkson bang on about how one day a child will be murdered by a fox.  However, the fox numbers have not multiplied a gazillionfold like the pro hunt movement said they would.  There simply isn’t enough food for the fox population, so they are not breeding.  Sure, if we all start keeping chickens again then people will most likely call for hunting to come back.  This does not look likely though does it?

I hope I’m right, but I do believe there are enough MPs who have the good sense to keep this sport banned.  They can still go out with their horses and dogs and do the hunt chasing scent trails, they’ve been doing this and they all seem to enjoy themselves.  It’s good exercise for the horses, and an excuse to get drunk with your posh mates.

The kill figures had nothing to do with aircraft numbers, and in fact are skewered towards the spitfire because German pilots were claiming to be shot down by them rather than the hurricane. In dogfights the hurricane was superior in almost every aspect to the spitfire.

The highest overall kill rate in the Battle of Britain went to a Polish hurricane squadron. The next three squadrons were also hurricanes. Also worth noting was the sheer number of explosive cannon shells the hurricane could withstand. The Germans couldn't understand how ineffective their this munition was to a canvas-covered wood frame. In contrast, one canon shell could take out a spitfire. Finally, most damaged Hurricane airframes were easy to repair with simple wood replacement and some fresh canvas. Spitfires required significant bodyshell spares and complex fixing/riveting procedures.

Either way, Sinclair isn't a defender and has never had to do that in his career. Relying on him to be the last port of defence on the left is suicide.

We used to pay your second formation under (I think ) Brian Little and had similar personnel in the two midfield and attacking midfield slots. 

If you remember, we got absolutely slaughtered by tactical teams because what it resulted in on defence was a pretty much flat back 5, with 2 (or if we were lucky and Tommy Johnson was working flat out) or 3 central midfielders having to shuttle left and right as the good teams would switch play very quickly.

By the second half of most games, our two CMs were fucked, and that left massive, massive gaps on the non-covered side for the opponents to stream through and attack.

5-3-2 is basically what we would have to play because we don't have the midfield personnel to dominate the middle against many (q. any?) teams. Most teams these days (as opposed to the last time we played 5-3-2) only have 1 striker, which means we've packed the defence and will have 2/3 against 5 midfielders. It will more often than not end in carnage for us as all that will result in is conceding territory up until our defenders - we will have given the opponent a free pass through our midfield. 

If we had some seriously talented midfielders, we could adapt this and play 3-5-2, but saying we play 3-5-2 and actually playing it are two very different things (I remember our manager at the time, again I think it was Little, could be Gregory, insisting we played 5 midfielders to journos, but the reality was we had alan wright mark charles/delaney, full backs). 

Villa have never been a club to value ball retention and posession, and we simply don't have the players. 5-3-2 will be a disaster.

7. His ""you can't arrest me because I'm happy"" but from Happiness Patrol

8th. The opening to, I believe, Stones of Venice.  From ""there she is, big beautiful and blue"" to sticking his head out of the TARDIS to yell at the people shooting at him that he didn't care for their hospitality. 

War:  nothing really. With so little spoken dialogue, I can't really choose at the moment. Maybe after another watch.  

9th. Everybody lives.  Because it's the exact opposite of most 5 stories. 

10th. His conversation with Jackson Lake about the info he saw and showing him all his past selves. 

11th. The bit about crying kids in Beast Below

See the breakdown [here](http://i.gyazo.com/71d2a8cdedbc917813b876b92a6b84c8.png) from Frontex which is the EU border agency responsible for monitoring activity across all borders in the EU. Notice how the largest immigrant groups are from Syria &amp; Eritrea? Now look [here](http://i.gyazo.com/1cfcfd4b509a245d6f21418730c2edaa.png), notice how asylum requests were granted to 94% of Syrian migrants &amp; 90% of Eritrean migrants. This hardly surprising when you look at the situation in these two countries. [Here specifically](http://i.gyazo.com/4ffde95a6355b284f76487198d5f6c32.png) is the migrant numbers at the mediterranean route in question, note again how the largest groups are Syrian and Eritrean. 

So quite frankly, what can I take from this? That Mr Brokenshire is talking total nonsense, unless his figures are somehow totally different from Frontex, which I don't see how that is possible (they're the agency responsible for collating all the data!). Perhaps he believes that Syrians aren't genuine refugees? No, what I think he's doing is downplaying the situation so that they [can feel good about the ridiculously limited action](http://i.gyazo.com/a52430fa701833849eda3dd98cd221b4.png) they're taking on this issue compared to some of our European 'partners' (notice how Sweden, a country with a population smaller than London, accepted 3 times as many refugees in 2014). After all they've made ludicrous commitments on net migration that anyone with half a brain knows they can't achieve. Sticking their head in the clouds as usual it seems.

Right, so telling you you're showing bias in how you're presenting two different politicians now counts as an ad hom argument. Sorry to break it to you but despite popular belief you can't win every argument on the internet by copying something you learnt off the Wikipedia list of logical fallacies incorrectly into an argument. It's probably worth learning what it actually means before continuing to use it.

Also those statements directly show that you're clearly not analysing them from an unbiased and sensible perspective. You don't need to be a direct supporter to show bias.

Anyway this argument has gone too far from the point to be worth having any more.

You're a picky one, but I'll give it a very brief go:

* We're not supposed to be living in a theocracy. If folk want to work on Sundays, that's their business, not that of the wise pharisees at Stormont

* As the piece from PWC on the budget that I've also posted shows, NI's economic growth rate is predicted to be less than the UK overall going forward. Forbidding economic exchange on Sundays, and the employment and pay of staff on the same day, doesn't help us make up the gap.

* For anyone who believes in individual liberty and personal freedom, the idea that a theocratic party that doesn't even get 30% of the vote can dictate that I can't buy a DVD at 0930 in the morning on a sunday is frankly offensive

* For many people who sweat and work their socks off all week, the weekend is the only real chance to shop. It isn't the 1950s anymore, with the wife staying at home all week to take care of such matters.

* Why would we want to stop small businesses from making additional money (and paying tax on that which can be used to pay for schools, hospitals etc etc)?

* u/DmcDY has already given good exposition on the usefulness to student populations of double time pay opportunities. Not actually a small argument. With the cost of studies, and the benefit to society of people studying, provision of earning opportunities for full time students is more important than commonly stated IMO.

As Windy has pointed out before, the achievements of players such as Jake Livermore are considered exceptional and a huge success. Just because Harry (once in a generation) Kane had the season of his life doesn't necessarily mean he will reach world class level. Moreso, even if he does it absolutely doesn't mean that we're going to suddenly have a bounty of world class players queueing to join the first team.

I worry that people here are becoming over reliant on the Spurs youth, I have seen ridiculous claims recently where fans have acted like Dele Alli, Onomah and Pritchard would be better fits to the first team than Stambouli, Townsend and Paulinho.

null,false,phys1cs,null,null,null,"How would you define profit for an individual? You couldn't use money left after housing, bills, food etc. because there's a huge variation in how much these cost which is largely discretionary, so you'd incentivise people to spend too much on these things. If you defined it as money left after *all* spending, you'd penalise long-term saving. Really, the only sensible thing to do would be to set some basic minimum level for essential spending and use that as the level of unavoidable costs, then tax income over that as 'profit', which people might choose to spend or to invest. You'd probably set it at about £1000 a month, and it would take the form of a tax-free allowance. You'd probably also want to offer further tax relief for long-term savings, and you'd also have some form of tax applied to consumption so that spending on luxury items was taxed but spending on essentials wasn't... And eventually, you'd end up with something rather like the tax system as it exists today.

The thing about companies is that the shareholders, directors and employees are ultimately all people, and any money the company makes does eventually get back to people, whether via salaries, dividends or capital gains. You can tax the company's income before it gets to shareholders and employees or after, but it's the same money. There are advantages and disadvantages to applying tax at each point, but in general you want companies to employ people and invest in productive capacity, and multinational companies in particular can be rather hard to pin down when you want to tax them. Taxing the people who own and/or work for companies at a higher rate than the companies themselves is a lot easier and more predictable than taxing the companies, and it's less likely to put companies off investing and creating jobs in this country. If we started taxing companies too much, many big businesses would just move to Ireland or somewhere, and a lot of small businesses would have to fire people.

There's definitely still a case for taxing businesses too, but I would be more concerned about actually collecting those taxes (i.e. by closing loopholes used by businesses to minimise their taxes) than increasing the level. If you simply increase the level of taxes on businesses, the tax will mostly fall on the companies that are already unable to avoid paying tax, and the companies that *can* avoid tax will have even more incentive to 'optimise' their affairs to avoid the higher tax too.",null,0,null,1436431510,null,0,false,0,csx80yb,null,t3_3cjbic,null,t1_csx80yb,null,t1_cswc6fk,null,null,null,1437706427,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

I guess it wouldn't matter that I've done a course in Critical Thinking at all would it. Ad, a preposition meaning to and hominem in the accusative case (as the direct object of ad's action). To the man, more apt though is ""to the character"" - an attack that ignores the argument of the person by simply discrediting their character or being. So saying I'm just a leftylabourlover and my 'opinion' therefore doesn't count.


You suggested my preference for Miliband was out of sheer blinded love of him or the Labour party. I do not support the Labour party. I said out of two people who have experience - one has real-world experience and a history of actually fighting for the poor and disenfranchised, the other does not. Therefore if I want someone in power who represents people, there is only one choice (in this assumed dichotomy of Miliband and Cameron). 

You don't have to be politically blind to see that he was the better candidate on experience. 

I even tuned in to the election debate events just to see him get roasted, as I thought he couldn't stand up to questions - to be honest, I was surprised he stood his ground and came across as more human than Cameron.

We have stop at red for the side effect of safety (i.e. in an ideal world we'd allow traffic to do what it wants, the world isn't ideal). If stopping at red proved to actually be dangerous to drivers we'd change traffic laws.

There is usually some ethical justification somewhere but the distinction is in which actions are unethical all in themselves.

Drug laws are another. We don't ban drugs because we're opposed to people enjoying themselves (in theory). We ban drugs because of harm. If it were demonstrated that something else would cause less harm we'd change the law (again in theory).

The distinction is that murder is not something that can be right in any world. There is no ideal world in which murder is fine. Anyway Wikipedia has more details on the distinct classifications.

null,false,fai1,null,null,null,"I buy, convert and let property out for a living, so I'll try to give you some advice on how to generate the most income from a rental property. 

Firstly, one family/person in a property is bad for income. You are better off with multiple people.

E.g

Rent for a 2 bedroom property: £125 a week
Rent for an individual room in a property: £80 a week.
So you're better off renting to 2 x individuals in that flat for £160 a week.

Soon as you hit 3 people, you are a HMO. If you want to avoid HMOs then stick with 2 bedroom apartments or houses (whatever is cheaper).

Rental income wise, the property should return 10% of its value as rent otherwise imo it is not worth even touching. The only exception to that is cheap places, like I just bought a shop+Flat for £40k which returns 8%. 

Don't think you have to buy an amazing property. Look in the cheaper parts of your area. 

-
If you don't mind doing a HMO then you can return a lot of money.

I buy places for a max of £150,000 and convert them into studio flats, on average I get 7 flats per property which generates me £30,000 a year. Tenants pay their own bills with studios.

The other option is bedsits which is easier as you do not need to do as much refurbishing. 

Lets say you buy a house for £150k, which can give you 5 bedsits. Each bedsit goes for £60 a week. 60*5 = £300 a week and £15,600 a year. 

Problem with bedsits is, landlord pays bills so you end up with less than 10% return after costs but still can be better than one family. There is also the problem of licensing laws, so you may want to stick with 2 bedroom places at the most. 

--
DSS claimaints are a goldmine. Do not reject them, at least consider them.

With housing benefit, you can get the money paid direct to you. The tenant has to request this which you can get them to do when you fill in their form with them. Otherwise if they do not speak English or are 8 weeks behind in their rent then its paid to the landlord.  Housing benefit is easy, its one form. If they need a bond, there are enough bond schemes out there to cover it. I even get a bond scheme company to now fill in the forms with them, I don't even meet the tenant as they vet them for me.

Rent being paid direct to the landlord means you don't have to chase them for rent or worry they may not pay you. 
Housing benefit claimants, especially those who are elderly or disabled tend to be long term so you have less hassle of finding new tenants, and don't lose as much rent


--
Some other tips are:

Do not accept dogs/cats, if the owners suck then the pets will suck as well. Caged pets tend to be fine.
I recommend avoiding children, or couples with the possibility of having children. People with kids will soon get to a stage where the place is too small and they need to move.
Old people are awesome, as they tend to stick around as they've done the kid thing and no longer work.
If you go down the HMO route, give everyone electric heating and cookers. No gas. Gas is a pain in the arse to deal with.

Gumtree is great for advertising. You do not need an estate agent or letting agent. Just whack an advert on gumtree and within a day you will have a huge list of possible tenants.

Don't be a dick to your tenants, they will be a dick back to you. But at the same time, don't be too friendly with them. Be nice, but professional. You have to still keep that landlord and tenant relationship while being nice to them. Don't be one of those landlords which takes forever to fix something or treats the tenant like shit because without them, you have 0 income.

Already covered this in my comment above, they're being replaced by loans which the vast majority of students receiving them will never have to pay back. The maximum amount of maintenance loans is also being increased, making living costs more affordable for poorer students.

&gt; Graduates will have to start repaying loans sooner

The earnings threshold is being frozen for 5 years. Considering how low inflation is at the moment, this won't have much of difference. We're probably talking about a couple of pounds a month for graduates earning &gt;£20,000. Not really significant.

Already covered in my comment above. To get housing benefit you will have to be in education, employment, or training.

To an extent, that's true, but it's also still used regularly by the right wing media for any bit of policy aimed at redistribution or even checking rising inequality.

&gt;But I suppose the beauty of the anarchism movement is anyone can adopt any doctrine that they like (provided it falls within some fairly loose bounds)

Well, within those two constraints I suppose that's true - there are certainly many schools of anarchism - from egoism and other forms of individualist anarchism, through mutualism to collectivist and communist anarchism.  There are also many ideas about tactics and a tacit agreement to allow people to pursue a diverse range of them, and that would certainly encompass a fair amount of more insurrectionary and combative forms (although actual civil war would be lethal for those engaging in it without massive popular support).

I'm in agreement with Douglas Murray on this with his sentiments in regards to holocaust deniers.  We squash these people by being an open and free society in which bad ideas are plainly visible to being squashed by good ideas in open discourse.  Censoring bad ideas because you don't like them just weakens the good ideas in the long run.  Only a short time will pass, a couple of generations, then you find yourself having no reasoning to affirm the good ideas as such, just a tyrannical acceptance that they're good because they're good.  Once you have such totalitarian tautologies, all of a sudden you find yourself in the situation where the bad ideas not only still possess their original set of reasoning to support them.

The cost of living is the same regardless of whether you are 24 or 25. This is my argument against apprenticeships as they currently are, yes the training is great, but how the hell are people supposed to live on £2 or £3 an hour. 

Then there are the sort of jobs that don't really require experience. They do exist - shelf stacking etc. There is no advantage to the under 25 employee in working for below the ""living wage"", because they aren't exactly going to get a qualification in shelf stacking out of it. Then, because the job itself is not difficult, and requires next to no training, as soon as the employee turns 25, the company can not give them any work (made easier by zero hour contracts), and hire the next 18 year old that comes along. Thus saving themselves money. 

Yes, a lot of people would have made themselves more marketable as they age, have picked up additional skills and so on.

Obviously you have your two men on each post then I'd like to see our best markers who are least likely to switch off man mark a player then with a few others like strikers who can sometimes lose concentration when they have to mark just defend an area of the area.

2) I prefer a back three because I feel it makes a lot solider as a unit. With a back three you can have your wing backs push forward and still be solid at the back to stop counter attacks. I feel sometimes with a back four you can easily be caught out with at times just two defenders back. 

3) For me midfield is all about balance and attacking the other teams weaknesses. IMO you need someone in there to break up the play, another who's going to dictate the game either higher up or from deep and someone who's going to be a goal threat but also be creative too. I don't think there is a perfect number of midfielders as it depends on the team your playing.

4) For me the best midfield we had was Mascherano (Destroyer) - Alonso (Deep playmaker) - Gerrard (Goal threat and creative). But I did also like our shape in midfield last season with Ibe - Henderson - Gerrard - Moreno - Coutinho - Sterling, the formation really helped us dominate the middle of midfield especially against teams playing 4-3-3.

This is the problem, in a way. 

There are swathes of under 25s who are ideologically against the Tories even when they would stand to benefit from them. To the extent that this budget could have promised to end world hunger, war and disease as well as giving everyone a hug and buying them a pint, but they would still think it's some kind of evil Tory plot. There are a lot of young people who hate the Tories just because they do, or because they're basing their opinions on the actions of a government 3 decades ago. (see the 'anti austerity' protests where 'fuck Tory scum' is the main message) 

If that's the message being sent to the government why would they ever write policies benefiting those who will never vote for them anyway?

Firstly, basically everyone has got a speeding ticket at one point in their life, the only time I would be a bit worried is if you're less than 2 years after passing your test, if that is the case you have to redo your test on 6 points, so basically, don't get another one! 

Secondly, you don't seen to know what you've been given, but based on what the police officer told you, you will receive a fixed penalty notice, you're not being prosecuted, its not a criminal record or a driving offence, or conviction or anything, you don't have to declare it on job applications! Its a fixed penalty notice, nothing more, you get the same thing for parking on double yellows, [read this](http://www.which.co.uk/cars/driving/driving-advice/dealing-with-speeding-tickets/speeding-fines-your-rights/)

I've applied for a few Canadian work permits and when you're applying they will ask you to do an ACRO police check. 

I am 99% certain that fixed penalty notices do not show up on this (I had one when I got mine and it didn't appear), but even if they do, they won't give a shit, its a speeding ticket, they're interested in DUIs and things. On an enhanced CRB it might appear, but also no one cares.

In terms of insurance, you can find out how much it'll be just go on comparethemarket or something, and add a speeding ticket and see what the difference is. I don't think you have to tell the insurance company until your insurance is renewed though, I certainly haven't, I guess check the T&amp;Cs, don't tell them if you can avoid it. 

You'll probably be looking at about £50-£100 extra on your insurance in the first year, roughly halving every year after that. I last got one in 2012 and I think it added £60, I was 26, I think it impacts your insurance more if you're younger, my dad had one when he was 50 or so and it only added about £10.

Likewise, staying with family isn't always possible. People should be encouraged and enabled to stay in education or further training, by making wages for apprenticeships liveable, and having a student finance system that enables one to survive without assuming that there will be help from family. Because it isn't always there. t is important to remember that the government also keep mooting things like housing benefit cuts for the under 25's, essentially a lot of people's lot in life is going to be determined by how able or willing their family is to support them.

 Also, people shouldn't be scared into doing things because the alternative is so awful. I suppose that I am thinking of positive encouragement rather than the threat of negative consequences - the carrot rather than the stick I suppose (in reality there is, and needs to be a little of both, of course doing a degree in science is going to afford one a higher standard of living than joining tescos at 18).

I'm talking about the national minimum wage cutoff which is 21, which itself is an age that most people recognize as marking full adulthood by any and all definition. I'm certainly not aware of any country anywhere in the world that sees adulthood as commencing at age 25. 

I suspect the *raison d'être* is twofold;

* 1) If you look at people who get paid the minimum wage, a LOT of them are under 25 years old. They tend to be people occupying low skill starter jobs in areas like retail, catering, call centers etc. By excluding them from this new measure you cut the actual bill to employers significantly.

* 2) The government has a real problem with youth unemployment. Not just here, but across the entire western world for a whole host of complex reasons. This move actually makes people under 25 **VERY** employable, all be it for the wrong reasons in my opinion. The difference between £6.50 and £9 an hour is £5200 a year full time to an employer... that's a lot of money, especially in industries like retail/catering where the vast majority of staff are on youngsters on the minimum wage. If anything we might see a strange effect where people aged 25 and over are going to struggle to find any work if they are unskilled because the low skilled jobs (like shop assistants and waitressing) are reluctant to take them on.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"&gt; What legal basis does 21 have?

I'm glad you asked. I suspect you're thinking of the age of majority which for the most part is 18... but 21 actually has a lot of legal bearing for historical reasons;

* The [National Minimum Wage](https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates) (NMW) sees 21 as being the age at which a person is entitled to the full rate adult rate.  The new ""Living Wage"" however shifts this to 25, which is a curious age that isn't reflected elsewhere in the law.

* At 21 you can adopt a child. 

* You can supervise someone else to learn to drive (provided you meet some other criteria as well). 

* You can apply for commercial pilot licenses, lorry licenses over 7.5 tonnes with a trailer or bus licenses. 

Essentially the age of adulthood has never been higher than 21. This new rate (although not called the adult rate) effectively shifts it up to 25. It says that a worker aged 24 (which is actually pretty fucking old in employment, as that person may well have already been working for 9 years!) isn't worth as much as one aged 25. 

I fully see why the government would do this (both to cut the overall bill and make under 25s more employable to business), but it strikes me as being wrong out of principle.

Perhaps you're giving a talk on ISIS in which at some point you discuss the history and origin of flag's design with a tangible visual aid.  Perhaps you just like annoying people.

We can devise any number of reasons for you to have an ISIS flag in which you don't actually support ISIS.  Banning the ISIS flag to get at ISIS supporters would be banning all of that as well.  You're also still left with ISIS supporters, they're just now unable to wave a flag in public.

Even if you were in support ISIS.  How does the simple fact of you owning their flag equal incitement?  If you show it to someone who doesn't know what it is, is it capable of incite them just by it's presence? The flag is just a flag, it's unable to incite anyone to anything, that would require the barer to commit themselves to forming arguments or assertions that are deemed to be inciting violence.

Because white people never really understood what we went through. No seriously. When a bunch of jolly young chaps once held me down to force feed me bacon to send me to hell, white people insisted it was hijinks. Note? Close to 6 Million Indians died for a rebellion that began due to a refusal to touch pork and beef. And I was vegetarian at the time. It's a dick move powered by racism and doubly so considering the history of South Asians but whitewashed by white people around me because it meant acknowledging the fact that someone from a model minority is subject to proper outright goose stepping racism. 

And this was in the 90's. Do you know what Asians and the 70's and 80's grew up thinking about white people? 

Fear. 

We had Paki bashing. Any Asian who got a bit too uppity was threatened. More stories? My mother once was punched by a patient. A fucking Cancer Patient didn't want a ""Sand Nigger"" and ""Paki"" to treat them. At the time people laughed it off. My mother worked in some of the worst places on the planet and even in occupied Kuwait and she never felt unsafe until this. 

We endured all this and we gave back so much. My parents stayed behind to treat trapped people in Kuwait. I represent the UK in India as a frontline medic. A real one, not the temporary staff who come and go but someone who has been here for nearly 6 years. 

You are ignoring all that bullshit and assuming we were given a chance to integrate. Not that we were consistently alienated. It's just that Indians were rich enough to throw up the middle fingers in the previous generation and their kids like me fought for a more accepting climate. My younger brother did not face any of this growing up. I did. It's the difference of 9 years between us and the changes that occurred. 

So tell me? What superstition had all those white people refuse to use vaccinations or whinge about transexuals or moan about gays? I love the fact that all Asians are responsible for the actions of less than 5% of rural fucking Pakistan but a sizeable chunk of British people who believe in nonsense and that's only  because they are idiots and not representative of being White and British. 

I repeat. Being white means the luxury of being treated as an individual rather than as someone who is inherently representing all caucasians all the damn time. If you fuck up it's your fuck up.

Something I disagree with.  I'm against the burning of books as an act of censoring the contents of those books of course.  But if you own a book that happens to be a holy book and set it on fire then no law should stop you from doing so.  It's your book to do as you please with.  The only laws that would apply would be ones of public endangerment or whatever restrictions you've broken from setting a fire in a public place.  The feelings of those people who hold such a book sacred should be of no consequence to society as whole.

Also if you came to the point where you were cold and needed to warm up to which burning a book was the only reasonable thing on hand.  Then first of all, forget the law, warm yourself up.  Secondly, if that's the state of affairs the society of laws has probably collapsed anyway.

I agree, but our law doesn't Im just trying to find the line and a consistancy were the law says its ok and were its not ok, I think banning the ISIS flag is closer to the laws of things we already ban.


&gt; The only laws that would apply would be ones of public endangerment or whatever restrictions you've broken from setting a fire in a public place.

Public endagerment for burning a small book sounds like a nonsense law aimed to ban something indirectly, but the same could used against the ISIS flag.


&gt; Secondly, if that's the state of affairs the society of laws has probably gone anyway.

you could have forgotten your gloves, its snowing icing and no money to spend in a shop or broken down somewhere. legally you could argue it.

&gt; It sends the message to me that you're a dickhead

If burning a book is considered incitement to provoke violence, then so is wearing a terrorist flag in a capital city tourist location of the country the terrorist group rallies against and hopes to destroy.

How do you possibly justifiy the expression of wanting to kill others for the exact culture you live, hes not actually harming anyone, but you can be arrested for posting a status on twitter inciting hatred to kill a particular group of people, but not for walking around with the symbol that carries the same message

&gt; I'm not intimidated by it, if you're meek enough to be then that's your own problem

if the flag was hung on your door or draped over your car to send a message to you (i.e intimidate) then whats the difference of sending the same message to a group of public.

After Wednesday’s Budget no one can accuse George Osborne of lacking audacity. Delivering the first such wholly Conservative statement since 1996, Britain’s chancellor tore into political certainties that had lain unchallenged for decades. It was undeniably a gamble, which if successful could change UK politics irrevocably.


Opportunities for such boldness come along rarely. The chancellor confronts an opposition flat on its back from defeat at the polls, and enjoys both improving public finances and the gratitude of his own backbenches. Having writhed for five years within the constraints of coalition the pressure was on Mr Osborne to show his true colours.



The chancellor ensured no audience would be disappointed, either in their glee or outrage. He delivered a raft of campaign pledges, most embodying a predictable shift to the right after years of compromising with the Lib Dems.


The first certainty that Mr Osborne set out to challenge was that his party, so long scarred with a nasty image, would shy away from the sort of measures that had earned it. This was most clearly manifested in an assault on the welfare budget. Under the Victorian-sounding command of “earn, or learn”, adults below the age of 21 were told not to come begging for housing or other benefits. Those that make it to university will have loans rather than grants to support them. Families planning a third child cannot expect help from the taxpayer.


Working-age benefits face the deepest cut, being frozen in cash terms till the end of this parliament, and withdrawn at a steeper rate and from a much lower earnings base.


Harsh medicine, indeed, for those who by indolence or bad luck languish at the bottom of the labour market. The wonky logic of “aspirational politics” dictates that this is balanced with handsome rewards for the fortunate, where once again the chancellor delivered on Tory pledges. The starting threshold for income tax is now so high that few of the truly low paid are much troubled by it. The higher rate threshold was raised, and Mr Osborne finally implemented a longstanding promise to cut inheritance tax for those bequeathed an expensive property.


The outward impression of a drive towards a smaller state was reinforced with an unexpected cut to corporation tax, which at 18p now approaches levels associated with tax havens. This is partially funded by an assault on the climate change levy — further evidence of how working with the greener Lib Dems had irked the chancellor. But Osborne budgets tend to include a dash of political cross-dressing, and so the chancellor announced an end to permanent non-dom status and a restriction on the tax relief granted to buy-to-let landlords — both measures that would raise a hearty cheer at Labour conference.


Indeed, look below the surface and for all of the bloodier offerings laid at the Tory altar, this Budget contained clear moves towards the pragmatic centre. By letting fiscal targets slip out by a year, the hitherto rollercoaster profile of spending cuts was smoothed. More surprising, over a third of the money raised in this Budget will come from a scattering of tax rises, including billions from dividends and insurance, raised in a stealthy manner that his Labour predecessors would cheer.



George Osborne’s second Budget of the year, updating economic and public finance forecasts, will reveal the scale of the cuts ahead for public services and welfare payments


Were that where the Budget stopped the verdict would be clear. The chancellor used his ample political capital to drag the centre ground closer to his party, with traps aplenty for the opposition and leftish alibis against the charge of being excessively ideological. Who, after all, can accuse a government of corporate capture when it imposes a surcharge on banking profits and the end to tax-avoiding non-doms?


But the most impudent act of clothes stealing was saved for last. The flaw in the Tories’ plan to turn Britain into a high-wage, low-welfare society lies in the first part. Without higher pay for the least well off, this Budget will boil down to a monumental redistribution from the poor to the rich. So, choosing a short-cut usually favoured by outright socialists, Mr Osborne bluntly announced a 40 per cent higher minimum wage for those over 25 years of age by 2020.


Such a move is beyond bold. In essence, the chancellor hopes to force businesses into filling the gap being left by the withdrawal of the state. A mandated wage that usually creeps up by 20p a year is to rise by £2.50 in five. This is an unprecedented encroachment into the private sector, affecting maybe five million workers directly. How the economy will react is impossible to say. Were the plan to fail, the result would be widespread business failure, a flood of migrants to the UK, pockets of deep regional distress and sharply increased unemployment. Yet should it work, the Budget could lay the foundations of long Conservative hegemony, perhaps under Mr Osborne. A chancellor not unused to gambling has just gone all-in.

Where you have people who are 'traditionally' mental (shouting at people who aren't there and trying to punch random passers by, actively trying to kill themselves, that sort of thing), most forces in E&amp;W can access, with some degree of delay, medical places of safety. Whilst police cells are used (and the consensus is that they are the absolute last resort), this is decreasing rapidly.

Where a mental health issue presents itself in custody, most forces can muster enough AMHPs and doctors to section there and then.

MH Crisis care in the NHS is properly pony, but there's been enough work done to mean that *most* MH issues that the police come across can be dealt with by a crisis service of one description or another, eventually.

The bigger problem is that fact that the people who routinely come into contact with the police are generally suffering some form of MH issue that leads to the offending behaviour, and it's the low-level underlying stuff that is the real challenge.

null,false,Herani,null,null,null,"&gt; I agree, but our law doesn't Im just trying to find the line and a consistancy were the law says its ok and were its not ok, I think banning the ISIS flag is closer to the laws of things we already ban.

Then I think we differ here.  You agree that burning something deemed to be a holy book shouldn't be illegal, that the status quo is what is wrong.  But then you go onto say that because this is the status quo things should fall in line all the same, like ownership of a flag.

I don't, I think the ownership of the flag should continue to be permitted and I think the status quo regarding the books should be what is overturned.

&gt; Public endagerment for burning a small book sounds like a nonsense law aimed to ban something indirectly, but the same could used against the ISIS flag.

I don't get such a sense, I think it's just about maintaining some semblance of safety in public areas.  If anyone could go and start fires in the middle of the street or squares then we may quickly run into all manner if instances of fires getting out of hand, even the small ones injuring people etc.  Surely just having some system involving the requirement of permits for such events is reasonable enough?

&gt; you could have forgotten your gloves, its snowing icing and no money to spend in a shop or broken down somewhere. legally you could argue it.

Which is why I said:

&gt; Also if you came to the point where you were cold and needed to warm up to which burning a book was the only reasonable thing on hand. Then first of all, forget the law, warm yourself up.

I feel that covers such scenarios.

&gt; How do you possibly justifiy the expression of wanting to kill others for the exact culture you live, hes not actually harming anyone, but you can be arrested for posting a status on twitter inciting hatred to kill a particular group of people, but not for walking around with the symbol that carries the same message

I covered in the initial response that merely brandishing a flag is in no way an explicit declaration of wanting to kill others... you have to actually express this for it to be threatening behaviour or incitement if you're trying to rally others to that cause.  So once you're actually expressing that the flag you happen to be carrying bares as much merit as the socks you happen to be wearing.

Then again with the status on twitter.  Something I disagree with.  People should have the right to be dickheads on the internet, someone being mean to someone or making a joke in poor taste shouldn't be a criminal offence.

&gt; if the flag was hung on your door or draped over your car to send a message to you (i.e intimidate) then whats the difference of sending the same message to a group of public.

Because we're talking about public as opposed to personal attacks.  Then we would also have to consider the message surely? if the message is ""look at this flag I like the design of""? should that be banned because you don't like the design?  You seem to just be operating under the assumption that if an ISIS flag is present then whoever is it's owner is a murderous psychopath or a supporter of murderous psychopaths.  Now I happen to think I should be able to own an ISIS flag if I so choose without even having to justify the reason to anyone else.  All without any worry about criminal charges for doing so and I don't in anyway support ISIS.

Just as an aside, what if ISIS tomorrow rebrands their flag and in doing so chooses to plagarise the Union Jack.  Should the Union Jack be banned because some murderers apparently like the look of it? or do we just accept that the problem is them being murderers and not get hung up about whatever aesthetic choices they make in their day to day?",null,0,null,1436441132,null,0,1436441507,0,csxaell,null,t3_3clvs7,null,t1_csxaell,null,t1_csxa63y,null,null,null,1437708318,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,Silhouette,null,null,null,"In the long term, I expect this will mostly just translate into freelancers, contractors and small agencies passing the extra tax burden onto their clients/customers through higher rates, just like any other business and any other overhead.

It's always been apples-to-oranges to compare taxation on dividend income for those working on a freelance or contractor model with taxation on salary income for those working as employees, though of course it's an easy way to generate antagonistic sound-bites. In practice, there are so many other differences in how these work/payment models are set up that it's silly to assume gross salary should equal gross charges to contract/freelance clients for doing similar work, or that taxation on both types of income should work the same way. It's all relative, as they say, though what it's relative *to* is rather important here.

But given that it is all relative, anyone who currently has agreed rates with clients based on the previous tax regime may in practice be stuck with those rates for a while in the new regime. Those people just took a 7.5% pay hit in the short term, give or take mitigating effects from the new allowances.

Perhaps more seriously in the long term, hiring a freelancer or contractor to do a job instead of taking on an employee is likely to become proportionately more expensive by this time next year, which makes it harder for the more flexible part of the workforce to attract business. Clients are going to have to put up with this (costing them more to get the work done through outsourcing), or they're going to push back successfully (in which case *those* freelancers/contractors really will lose out). Either way, it's a significant push towards permanent employment, and it's far from clear that that is what you want given the advantage of having a significant amount of more mobile labour in your workforce and the reality that anyone working as an employee is unlikely to grow a significant new business of their own as their career progresses.",null,0,null,1436441369,null,0,false,0,csxah46,null,t3_3cj69e,null,t1_csxah46,null,t1_csx9nth,null,null,null,1437708376,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I put up a post earlier, to help someone else out. It explains roughly how I get the most out of rental property.  This post is long, but I think it will help you a lot.

You may find some problems with getting a BTL mortgage and all the shit they make you go through, but tbh I can't really help you on that as I don't do them any more as I generate enough income each year from property to buy them outright or to go 50/50 with my brother.

Heres me post:


---

I buy, convert and let property out for a living, so I'll try to give you some advice on how to generate the most income from a rental property.
Firstly, one family/person in a property is bad for income. You are better off with multiple people.
E.g
Rent for a 2 bedroom property: £125 a week 

Rent for an individual room in a property: £80 a week.

So you're better off renting to 2 x individuals in that flat for £160 a week.

Soon as you hit 3 people, you are a HMO. If you want to avoid HMOs then stick with 2 bedroom apartments or houses (whatever is cheaper).

Rental income wise, the property should return 10% of its value as rent otherwise imo it is not worth even touching. The only exception to that is cheap places, like I just bought a shop+Flat for £40k which returns 8%.

Don't think you have to buy an amazing property. Look in the cheaper parts of your area.

--
HMOS:

If you don't mind doing a HMO then you can return a lot of money.
I buy places for a max of £150,000 (Normally I try to go for £100k max) and convert them into studio flats, on average I get 7 flats per property which generates me £30,000 a year. Tenants pay their own bills with studios.

The other option is bedsits which is easier as you do not need to do as much refurbishing.

Lets say you buy a house for £150k, which can give you 5 bedsits. Each bedsit goes for £60 a week. 60*5 = £300 a week and £15,600 a year.

Problem with bedsits is, landlord pays bills so you end up with less than 10% return after costs but still can be better than one family. 

There is also the problem of licensing laws with HMOs, so you may want to stick with 2 bedroom places at the most.

--- 
Housing benefit/DSS

DSS claimaints are a goldmine. Do not reject them, at least consider them.

With housing benefit, you can get the money paid direct to you. The tenant has to request this which you can get them to do when you fill in their form with them. Otherwise if they do not speak English or are 8 weeks behind in their rent then its paid to the landlord. Housing benefit is easy, its one form. 

If they need a bond, there are enough bond schemes out there to cover it. I even get a bond scheme company to now fill in the forms with them, I don't even meet the tenant as they vet them for me.

Rent being paid direct to the landlord means you don't have to chase them for rent or worry they may not pay you. Housing benefit claimants, especially those who are elderly or disabled tend to be long term so you have less hassle of finding new tenants, and don't lose as much rent

---
Some other tips are:
Do not accept dogs/cats, if the owners suck then the pets will suck as well. Caged pets tend to be fine. 
I recommend avoiding children, or couples with the possibility of having children. People with kids will soon get to a stage where the place is too small and they need to move.


Old people are awesome, as they tend to stick around as they've done the kid thing and no longer work. 


If you go down the HMO route, give everyone electric heating and cookers. No gas. Gas is a pain in the arse to deal with.

Gumtree is great for advertising. You do not need an estate agent or letting agent. Just whack an advert on gumtree and within a day you will have a huge list of possible tenants.

Don't be a dick to your tenants, they will be a dick back to you. But at the same time, don't be too friendly with them. Be nice, but professional. 

You have to still keep that landlord and tenant relationship while being nice to them. Don't be one of those landlords which takes forever to fix something or treats the tenant like shit because without them, you have 0 income.",null,0,null,1436441562,null,0,false,0,csxaj2q,null,t3_3cnn73,null,t1_csxaj2q,null,t3_3cnn73,null,null,null,1437708414,null,11,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,11,null

Options are M&amp;S (6%, £250pm), TSB (6%, £250pm) and First Direct (6%, £300pm). Note I think you need a current account with the respective bank to access these but that shouldn't be a problem except possibly First Direct who I think have stricter requirements. You can of course have regular savings accounts with multiple providers so you could be putting your full £400 into different savers.

Suspension needs constant attention because Alfa/Fiat cheaped out on it, hence bushes wear out, arms squeak, and the springs/shocks are so poorly matched it feels both wallowy and hard/crashy at the same time... the swirl flaps on the inlet manifold are know to detach themselves and grenade the engine and/or turbo.... the quality of the underseal seems to depend entirely on which shift were working in the  factory in Itally when it was built, hence you can get one with a top seal job that'll outlast the car, and some that have completely rotted through in 5 years.... my local trusted specialist is a 90 min drive away... the paint seems to be one step up from butter on the hardness scale, so it's peppered in stone chips... there's wind noise and squeaking from the frameless door/window seals... Alfa pre-installed at least 5 unidentifiable rattles in every car (between the dash and the tailgate usually).... Camber isn't adjustable (remember the cheaped out suspension design?) so it tends to eat tyres.... Oh and it's a bit of a money pit that I can't help but keep spending money on...

It is not personal when the symbol attacks your identity and values as a westerner? when the symbol the group represents targets people like you?

it is when that flag exists to express that message. Would you get away with carrying a rainbow flag under section 28, claiming you just like the colour of rainbows?

It's my first car since passing my test just under a year ago.

Cheap insurance was the only reason I bought this car to be honest, as I'm sure everyone is aware of how expensive insurance can be for us younguns...

Nothing all that special about the Fiesta, it kinda just gets you from A to B. Can't ask for much more from a 1.25 engine I suppose ;)

The MPG isn't all that great as I do about 30 miles on the motorway everyday and the little engine doesn't like that too much (3000rpm @ 70mph), but for round town and local driving it does about 45MPG which is pretty darn good. But I usually average about 27MPG.

  This used to happen much more than it does now. Because of the huge gulf in financial clout and global support between the top six and the rest of the league, there are fewer surprises. We won't see Crystal Palace or Norwich City finishing third again anytime soon (1991 and 1993 respectively), or a team like Blackburn coming along and winning the league (1995). 

  At the start of each season, the teams who will finish in the top 6 are pretty much predetermined. Sometimes Everton, Southampton, or Newcastle will have an especially good season and will break into the top 6, but they'll disappear the following season as they sell off all the players who got them there.

  The title race is, by February, normally a two horse race, and it's normally the two favourites from August. Sometimes Arsenal or Liverpool will push for 2nd place, but not very often these days. The CL spots are normally so certain that only the final one is ever contested, and three out of Man Utd, Man City, Chelsea and Arsenal are pretty much guaranteed a place, with only one of them left battling with us and Spurs for the fourth.

  The game is better these days and I enjoy watching it more.

- if you are really saving over £13k a year (as opposed to it being a one off event), you could have this mortgage paid off in about 6 years. don't know about you, but that sounds quite appealing to me.

- is your mortgage interest rate higher than your savings rate (it probably is). if so, consider an offset mortgage or one that allows repayments with no penalty, if only to put the money to use while you think about what to do with it long term. you're making a lot of money and possibly paying too much interest on your mortgage unnecessarily.

- i have worked in UK real estate (my full time job, not a BTL investor) since 2008 and i cannot tell you where house prices are going. anyone who says they know with any real certainty is lying. the smart money invests in property only in scenarios where they aren't reliant on price increases to make money (and can withstand price drops without going bust). they also diversify to avoid localised risks, which sounds very relevant to your situation. imagine what would happen to house prices if a large local employer went out of business, or similar?

- renting (or business generally) to family members isn't the worst idea, but it can test relationships. how confident are you that your dad will always be able to afford the rent, and what will you do if he can't?

as ever, it is impossible to advise anyone without more thorough information. it would be essential to know things such as your age, life goals, current pension position etc. i wouldn't want to advise you to do anything without knowing this sort of information, so please understand that people will generally be very reluctant to give you specific advice (including me)",null,0,null,1436442604,null,0,false,0,csxaunb,null,t3_3cnnit,null,t1_csxaunb,null,t3_3cnnit,null,null,null,1437708571,null,5,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,5,null

Again we seem to be off here and I don't know if it's my communicating this poorly.  But what I'm posting here isn't my necessarily posting what is the case in what is the law of the land.  It's me posting what I think should be the case, what should be the law of the land.  Whether we're talking about current laws and what they prohibit or a proposal of what should be prohibited or could fall under existing laws makes no difference to me if my opinion is that that they shouldn't be.

&gt; It is not personal when the symbol attacks your identity and values as a westerner? when the symbol the group represents targets people like you?

Well first off, what is my identify and values as a Westerner? If I differ am I attacking other Westerner's identities and values?

Leaving that aside, no symbol has ever done this to me and I don't believe symbols are capable.  People are capable of this, my focus would be on people who are attempting to murder me by violently opposing values I believe in.  What flag they fly, what their favourite colour is, I just don't find any concern in that and I find those that are hung up on these frivolities to be distracted by insignificances in order to feel they've achieved some small win where ever they can get it.

Again though.  That what I'm saying may be counter to the status quo, it's still what I feel on the matter.  And why I'm certainly capable of being wrong, I don't think something being the status quo makes it automatically right.

&gt; it is when that flag exists to express that message. 

No it doesn't.  People in ISIS certainly don't view it as such, they would see it a symbol of hope and their own aspirations as much as any Western nationalist would view their own.  Flags don't hold any intrinsic meaning at all, we give them that and if we happen to choose to revere them or to fear them is of our own doing, the flag did nothing.  Ask people in various parts of Afghanistan how they view the American flag being that it's printed on the side of the drones that are so numerous and constant in their skies that an entire generation of people have grown up in that area being fearful of a clear blue sky.

I drive a Honda Civic 07 reg (2.2 CDTi). Had it for 2 years and I am really happy with it. MPG is good (I average 55 to 60 on my daily commute along the M1) and it costs me about 50-60 quid to fill the tank from almost empty. I love the dashboard design and layout of the instruments and the build quality feels solid.

In terms of driving, the throttle is responsive and even at higher speeds you can still squeeze some more acceleration out of it. It is a bit slower to accelerate in the first gear without really putting your foot all the way down, but being a diesel it's never going to be fast off the mark anyway. Ride is a little bit bumpy and can get quite alarming on poor road surfaces.

From a practicality point of view, I really love this car. The boot is massive especially when you fold the back seats down completely. I'm a drummer so you can imagine how much gear I have to carry and it all fits very comfortably in my car.

Maintenance wise I've only had one major cost so far which was replacing a cracked exhaust manifold. I do a lot of miles (50k in the last 2 years) so I take her in for service roughly every 6 months.

Putting £100 a month for each of them into an ISA would use £2,400 of your allowance (assumes you and your partner don't already max both ISAs) but allow it to grow free of capital gains. Once you want gift it to your children sell the funds and withdraw the money from the ISA (which is free of income tax) and gift it to your children (after 15 years would be circa. £27k). This shouldn't be too hard for them to put away into an ISA themselves over the course of a couple of years or use for a house deposit.

It's something to think about, especially if when they receive the money, and what they can use it for, is important to you (to prevent them blowing it on a new car at 18).

null,false,MDKrouzer,null,null,null,"I drive a Honda Civic 07 reg (2.2 CDTi). Had it for 2 years and I am really happy with it. MPG is good (I average 55 to 60 on my daily commute along the M1) and it costs me about 50-60 quid to fill the tank from almost empty. I love the dashboard design and layout of the instruments and the build quality feels solid.

In terms of driving, the throttle is responsive and even at higher speeds you can still squeeze some more acceleration out of it. It is a bit slower to accelerate in the first gear without really putting your foot all the way down, but being a diesel it's never going to be fast off the mark anyway. Ride is a little bit bumpy and can get quite alarming on poor road surfaces.

From a practicality point of view, I really love this car. The boot is massive especially when you fold the back seats down completely. I'm a drummer so you can imagine how much gear I have to carry and it all fits very comfortably in my car.

Maintenance wise I've only had one major cost so far which was replacing a cracked exhaust manifold. I do a lot of miles (50k in the last 2 years) so I take her in for service roughly every 6 months.

Edit: Forgot to mention, that what I don't like is the fact that I don't have a USB or AUX input. You can't easily add a third-party aftermarket stereo into the Civic because of how the dashboard is designed so I use a bluetooth FM transmitter now

&gt;Cutting housing benefit for the young

Will affect many people no doubt about it. But it is meant as a deterrent. Earn. Or Learn. The only group I can think that would struggle with this is those that are unemployed, have no skills and their parents hate them. Which IMO will be a very small part of the population. The vast majority of people collecting this benefit when they don't need it i'd say is pretty large.



&gt;no 'living wage' for the under 25s

Hmm, i thought this was pretty clear. Why the hell would you hire an inexperienced 18 year old for £9 an hour by 2020?

you wouldn't. That is absurd. You start from the bottom then by the time you are 25 you are pushed up to a decent wage. I don't see the problem with this.


&gt;crapping the maintenance grant and turning it into a loan so you have more debt

If you calculate the current loan repayments you'd be dead before you manage to repay it. And you can even move country and nothing happens to you as many have.

At most I believe you get £12 taken off your pay every week as tax. Like... That is no issue at all. You go to higher education to get a decent paying job. you shouldn't be bothered by that.

For sure it is really economical in the ways you say. (I've done about 18000 miles in the year).

As a rough rule of thumb I get 54-55 mpg round town, 60-65 mpg on A roads and motorways. If I'm making- say- a 100 miles journey, I drive within the speed limit and there are no big hills, I always expect over 60 mpg.

Obviously it matters how you drive - if you have to go very fast or say park in a multi-storey car park, you will use more fuel.

As the car has a trip computer, I've seen that fuel economy depends very heavily on outside temperature also i.e. it's worse when it's colder, and very much worse if it's freezing outside.

I entirely believe Ford's figures, since the conditions of the testing are pretty favourable to fuel economy (takes place in the warm and you are allowed to accelerate very slowly.)

Because it is turbocharged, it is actually very fast. I used to have an 09 1.4 Polo SE from new, and it's definitely faster than that. As a rough comparison I used to get 40 mpg or so from the Polo.

&gt;but at some age the government has to step back.

We're talking about people who have never been given help to live on their own so what's this about stepping back? The problem is they don't step forward enough. Why should somebody who can't afford to look after themselves be forced to join the forces? There should be more options (and there used to be). But it is a very significant problem right now that kids in poor areas leave school, alot of them without enough qualifications to go on to further education, and are forced to either find a job (which means temporary job seekers, being dirt poor for an extended period of time etc) or find some other means to live. There are a lot of benefits that are there to help a person out whilst they work if they have an extremely low wage. People leaving school are not largely entitled to these. So what's the alternative? Crime, drug dealing etc.

The point is, if you get through all that and then find a minimum wage job, still can't afford to live and you aren't entitled to the benefits the rest of the country is entitled to, then the government has done something wrong. This is not a small case by case problem this is a huge problem already and it is growing.

Firearms are ubiquitous with crime in the US, so police there essentially require firearms simply to maintain a level playing field. Whatever we might think about the legality or sense behind allowing firearms, the US broadly supports it (although they clearly disagree over what extent it should be regulated). They've been brought up with it as a core tenant of the freedoms they believe in. It's enshrined in their constitution and in their public mentality at a deep level.

One way to think about it is like the monarchy. It's a thing we believe in (mostly) and see as a core principle of the institutional credibility and fairness that makes being British what it is... but to a lot of outsiders whose countries developed into republics from brutal monarchies it seems odd and doesn't make sense that we would support it... but we do.

But I maintain that our newfound appreciation of other cultures' food *is* multiculturalism. Trade is the simple buying of goods from one another, and can take place internationally or locally. The act of actually buying, say, rice from China to eat with our curries and sweet and sour chicken would be trade. But the fact that there's increased demand for that particular kind of trade nowadays is due to multiculturalism.

It's the adoption of a people's cooking habits in response to several decades of exposure to new cultures.

And some of the blame has to be placed on London's transport infrastructure. There should be alternatives to the tube. I mean, say the tube system was down for a reason other than striking, like a power cut or computer failure. There should be adequate alternative provision.

You already have a degree in CompSci, and the basic principles in programming haven't changed that much.

I would agree that taking on some projects in your personal time and putting them on GitHub would be a smart move. You could also get involved in some open source projects.

Grab a copy of [CodeComplete](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670) and read it. It will refresh your mind and put you in good stead and build your confidence.

Also, learn web technologies. HTML for sure, and javascript. A lot of stuff is web based now, even corporate applications. You could also learn mobile, android and iOS development which is in demand.

If you want to go into enterprise/corporate line of work, you can't go wrong with learning C-sharp and the .Net framework. There is a lot of call for people with these skills and the job market is good. You can sit some microsoft exams if you want to prove you're serious about it and I would say they're more use than a masters right now.

I would also recommend the [CleanCode](https://cleancoders.com/category/clean-code) videos. They're based around Java, but the principles are language agnostic to be fair. You can erm, &lt;cough&gt;, erm, find them online if you know where to look. The videos go over stuff like unit testing, dependency injection and all the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design) which if you know and understand, will go a long way.

""Eligibility for a Speed Awareness course is calculated by taking the speed limit plus ten per cent, then allowing an additional two to nine mph (the Association of Chief Police Officers recommends no more than an additional six mph).""

It won't/shouldn't affect any visa applications as it's not a criminal conviction, however read the application properly and declare it if they ask otherwise if they find by themselves your visa application is basically over.

No, but you should have opinions which are least partly fact based if you don't want to be seen as prejudiced. Claiming that Kendall makes a big deal of being an 'empowered woman' is nonsense. She hasn't played on that, she's just put across her views as any other politician does.

They might well not, but it isn't based on her having 'empowered woman' mannerisms. 

&gt;It's exactly the same reason why Jeremy Corbyn can't win an election. He's got some great ideas and his personal credibility is unparalleled... but apart from giving the left a semi, he isn't going to enthrall aspirational middle England when he starts talking about the welfare state, and he won't win an election by talking about the needy - in precisely the same way that Miliband couldn't.

null,false,barejokez,null,null,null,"let's talk about ISAs first.  there are two types - one which behaves just like a bank account, and another that behaves like an investment account. in fact that is what they are.

the key thing that differentiates ISAs from bank/investment accounts is that ISAs incur no tax. Normally, people in the UK pay tax on income (which includes interest on a bank account, or dividends paid by company shares) and on increasing value (capital gains, which only applies to investments). With an ISA, both of these taxes are ignored, so all money made is tax-free.

that isn't a huge deal for kids, as both types of tax have an annual allowance below which you pay no tax.  If you don't have a job, it takes a lot of other income to hit this limit, and likewise a large amount of assets increasing in value to incur capital gains tax. So most kids aren't paying these taxes anyway.

ISAs are more relevant on day one for working adults, but they can become relevant for kids as time goes on. If you put money aside every year, then by the time a kid turns 18, they could well be incurring tax above the limits, and if they then get a job, they almost certainly will. If you invest in their ISA while they are young, and you believe the tax treatment won't change (which seems a fair assumption), then they will reap the rewards of this approach later in life.

there are also other routes you can use. you could set up normal bank accounts (which might be a better path if you can get higher interest rates than in a cash ISA). You could hold the money yourself and gift it to them age 18 (which gives you more control, but sacrifices their ISA allowance). You could put it in a pension in their name (which will gain other tax benefits, but could lock up the money for 60+ years, which at least shields them from young adult bad decisions).

Without that it seems to have been a very regressive budget, hitting the poorest deciles hardest. According to [people on Twitter](https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/619137478201618433) there is usually a similar chart on the distributional impact of the Budget in the official Treasury documents, but it was curiously missing this year.

I think with IT it's about skills &amp; experience, not degrees, and not necessarily in IT.  Many IT jobs are more functional, and less technical since the jobs are being poached by outsource companies from abroad. That said, what skills do you have in IT?

You've got experiencing in working with people; many (stereotype) IT people don't have good communication skills, I imagine you do if you've progressed so well, so leverage that.  Look for possible positions in IT Training departments, most large companies will have them.

You're far too overqualified for a graduate job, so don't aim low as you've got pressure to support a family. If you're as good at teaching as you sound, you should be able to leverage that experience, together with your IT knowledge, to get yourself a good role.  The issue might be relocating.  You've just got to market yourself, maybe not as someone who wants to get out of teaching, but someone that is progressing from teaching in a school, to someone teaching somewhere else?

Alternatively it would not take THAT much time to get some updated knowledge of IT skills.  e.g. if you did Java at Uni, it's still a relevant skill.  Android is the largest mobile platform and still is dominated by Java, and isn't that hard to get up-to-speed with.  It is also a very in-demand skill.  I do Android on the side, and I get emailed by people looking for Android development skills on a weekly basis, just off my Linked-In profile.

If you want, post your CV, I/we can take a look.

But I got a great deal on it as the body shape was changing, so why the hell not ( it cost less than the VW I was thinking of at the time) Basically it suits my life which is built around blasting motorway miles. It has air suspension and is pretty much all the car I need. Has nifty things like self -parking, the engine has good enough poke and the torque gives it smooth progression through and a lovely Motorway presence. It's not too shabby round town either with the suspension taking out the rough roads. It's solidly built , little bit pedantic on its interior design and some rather old fashioned touches, but I sat in the A6 , 5 series, Lexus and of all those this seemed to be the least inoffensive. 

It's also the laziest car I've drive in along time. I mean you don't fuss about anything. You sit, you point and you eventually get there. If you want to hoon about a bit , it will play but it lets you know that if you wanted to really mess about you should have dropped 20K-30K more on the AMG. 

Downsides: needs winter tyres, the twin headlamps at the front look a bit odd and you get mistaken at the airport for the Chauffeur.

Seriously though, the car just chills you out, and if you spend ages on motorways, stuck in traffic jams etc. It's fantastic. A practical example is that I do day trips to Scotland and London now without trepidation at how tired I'm going to be.

A few schoolboy errors; one of the goals came from us literally leaving a player wide open on the penalty spot.

Apart from that, not a bad training match. Isgrove looked good again, as he tends to in preseason. Still would like to see him play in the hole, just to see what he might be capable of. McQueen had some good runs, still a bit of a clumsy player though. If only Lallana were here to help sharpen him up.

Juanmi looks very positionally aware, very quick on loose balls. He'll need to strengthen a bit to cope with the Premier League though. Damn good finish for his chance. 

Soares looks very promising, the only thing that worries me is that we still don't have a set player that we have on the right for him to link up with. Maybe Gaston if he proves his worth? Koeman will sort out any defensive kinks so I'm not worried about that.

Rodriguez will score more than 20 league goals this season if he stays fit. He looks sharper than ever, and he was barely even trotting for a lot of the match. 2 goals in 45 mins of leisurely play couldn't speak louder words to his ability to find chances.

The incredible reality of the Tories is they are actually far less evil than they are suggesting. We have a government that goes to the polls and says ""we're going to fuck up everyone"" and then actually does far less fucking up.

It is a very strange time when the Tories can be far more moderate than their vocal position and the average voter will eat it up.

&gt; The budget began with a sensible admission of austerity’s limits. Mr Osborne originally planned to bring the public finances screeching back into the black by 2018-19. He rightly changed his mind. Britain’s deficit will be 3.7% of GDP this year—sizeable, but not crushing. The country has plenty of fiscal wiggle room, as the IMF’s economists have pointed out. Growth should do much to reduce borrowing. Mr Osborne’s decision to extend his deadline by a year, to 2019-20, was correct.

Yes and I expect we'll see that boundary pushed out again. In fact I fully expect our deficit come the next election to match what Ed Miliband proposed rather than what Cameron's government proposed.

&gt;Workers subject to zero-hour contracts may be subject to exploitation as they may be denied work at any time for any reason, including declining to respond to a demand to work. A refusal to work in any one instance for any reason can result in a prolonged period of lack of work. In 2014, millions of workers were still trapped in low-paid, highly insecure jobs, where mistreatment is the norm and where there is limited prospect of escape, said Trade Union Congress. Due to the uncertainty of the workers' schedules zero-hour contracts present problems for workers with children due to the difficulty of arranging child care.

Just because you aren't financially dependent on your family (because they can't afford to pay for another adult) it doesn't mean you don't have family and you should have to leave them just to make ends meet as soon as you're old enough. There's no arguing that it's fair that working class teens are forced to leave their families to work or join the army when middle class teens have the choice of uni, a job or parents paying for them until they have sorted themselves out with a job. The government needs to do more to help those kids out, it's as simple as that.

And as for the wage argument, again, we're going round in circles because you ignored my earlier point. We're talking about minimum wage jobs, not competitive middle income salaries. Putting under 25s on a lower minimum wage only helps the middle classes in the same way it helps them intern for free whilst their parents pay for them. The government needs to create more jobs and have more schemes for young people to get into work, and no not forcing them to work for under minimum wage by ""volunteering"" them when they are on jobseekers.

We need to start with basic understandings of the way money works and how it is created by the banks.  If we took this power away from the banks, the power to create wealth, and the decisions on where that wealth is invested, then we could fix the global economy nearly over night. 

I know it sounds far fetched, but its really true, and really that simple.

Look into a group called PositiveMoneyUK.org and the suggestions they're making.

There's a couple of good documentaries on it that might spike your interest, 97% owned is a good one.  Everyone immediately says ""conspiracy theory"" but I promise its not.

You increase low paid wages, then the larger economy reacts (especially if we're talking about a group as large as ALL public servants). 

For an example:

Perhaps the extra pay means that an extra 10% cars are sold because all of these public sector workers are able to buy new cars to replace their shitty bangers, which means an increase in car production (look at that productivity spike!), which means more people are hired to build cars (hey solves our unemployment problem too!), which means more income tax (and NI contributions helping to pay those nurse wages) and more VAT from selling cars.

I did some source hunting for [an argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/3cnumw/raheem_sterling_phones_in_sick_again/csxa8ov?context=3) in /r/soccer on the issue. Here's a quote from Brendan when the first contract offer was rejected:

&gt;""Obviously the club are speaking with his representatives on it,"" reported the boss. ""I would think that will be concluded very imminently.

&gt;""You can see he's very happy, it's nothing to do with Raheem - he wants to be here. Hopefully we'll get a solution on that very soon.""

Already the early signs are that the problem is with Sterling's ""representatives"" and not Sterling himself.

This also puts paid to that nonsense theory that Rodgers was the one who made the contract situation a big media story or that he was somehow twisting the media against Raheem.

It's right there. 

""It's nothing to do with Raheem.""

I hope that if we end up keeping hold of Raheem that he's smart and fires Ward. If he handles it well then that scum will fall and carry all the blame with him.
