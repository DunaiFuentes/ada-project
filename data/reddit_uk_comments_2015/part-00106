HOWEVER, that isn't likely to happen for several reasons;

* We only just had a referendum 6 months and 3 days ago... it was economically disruptive, took years of campaigning and the result was by the terms of the arrangement between Holyrood and Westminster conclusive. 

* The whole point of Westminster allowing the first referendum was that they *thought* they were calling the SNPs bluff... i.e. that Scots wouldn't back their vision of independence. In reality the result was close to call, and there was a lot of last-minute deal making. I doubt any Westminster party will be keen to repeat a gamble like that again any time soon.

Probably the closest shot Scots have would be if the UK left the EU... but that isn't going to happen. Contrary to what the Daily Mail headlines might suggest, the English aren't stupid when it comes to the EU. Like Scots voting in the independence referendum most English people ultimately care about one thing above all else: prosperity. They might not like seeing 200,000 foreigners turn up every year... but when push comes to shove they'll probably admit that we're better off because of the EU, and would be very reluctant to change that.

&gt; Paying down the oldest debts gives us a chance to focus on the newer ones.

I know it *sounds* good, but actually this isn't relevant.

If you've got a 30 year mortgage at 5%, you'd be foolish to concentrate on paying that off first, just because it's older than your 20% credit card debts.

If you owe £100 on the mortgage and £100 on the credit card, in a year's time the mortgage debt will be £105 and the card debt will be £120. If you have £100 in your hand today, which one of those do you pay off?

That's all Osborne has done when he paid off these bonds - he's paid off his credit card by extending his mortgage a bit, because the latter gives him a better interest rate.

So 70% of British government debt is owed to people in the UK – our pension funds, and the like.
If interest rates did go up on government debt, this would just mean our pension funds would get fatter. Essentially, British people have lent money to the British government to make up for the tax money lost through unemployment.

The reason you hear about countries or overseas banks buying our debt and not lets say a poor African country is because our government debt is backed by us the tax payer. We are the national insurance. Thats why its called that by the way.

A national debt is not necessarily a bad thing. We could balance the books and be debt free. live within our means. But a giant cash injection speeds up growth. We can build infrastructure and pay later with the money we profit from that infrastructure. If the gov borrowed money to give us super high speed broadband we would benefit from it and pay off that debt while making money from it. 
If the gov didn't borrow money to build the M25 lets say, would we as a country be poorer today. It was a debt to ourselves, tax payers, worth taking out.

Seriously, I generally say, as self defined Irish, that anyone who wants to belong here should be able to. You also have heritage in your Da, so you have a prior claim. 
In a way, this is a part of the world that doesn't really belong, ie Britain or Ireland, so you could maybe empathise with that. We have our own racism here, with a world leading brand of sectarianism, so don't think that you would not experience racism here. Or sectarian, you could be called a protestant Chinese b.....d, for example!
Many people here reject the N Irish definition, preferring British or Irish (and thereby hangs another tale) but a growing number of people prefer the form N Irish, rejecting the either /or nature of much of our society to date.
On a more positive note, it can be a good place to live and people are generally friendly.
Your heritage, should you choose to embrace it, comprises ancient Ulster myths contemporaneous with Greek myth, poets like John Hewitt, Louis McNeice, musicians like Van Morrison the Undertones (Irish not NI) and wee Derek Bell from the Chieftains. As well as orthodox Unionism, there is a fine strand of liberalism within the Protestant tradition, refusal to slave trade in Belfast, Presbyterians wishing for a United Ireland etc etc. so a fine blend of paradoxes and things to get confused about.

&gt;The __ancient universities__ are seven extant British and Irish [medieval universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_university) and [early modern universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_early_modern_universities_in_Europe).  Four of these are located in [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland), two in [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), and one in the [Republic of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland). The ancient universities in the British Isles are amongst the [oldest extant universities in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_universities_in_continuous_operation).

&gt;
&gt; A countersignature must be a person who enjoys a good reputation in the community, possesses a current British passport and has credentials that can be checked, and who would have something to lose by wrongly countersigning an application. For logistical reasons it is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of all professions and organisations where persons holding a responsible position are acceptable to verify passport applications. While there is no qualification for a ""person of similar standing"" this may be interpreted in the widest sense, but it must always be borne in mind that a countersignature should normally be someone who:
&gt; 
&gt; * has qualifications that can be checked; and,
&gt; * it is believed will not risk a career or reputation by knowingly making an untrue statement in completing the countersigning section of an application form.

Why is it so hard to believe that Jose will promote some players from our academy? Are these fans obsessed with chasing bragging rights for fielding more homegrown players than opposition teams? Or have they become too impatient waiting that they don't even care about promoting quality players from our academy? Over the years, how many youngsters from our academy were talented enough to be part of our regulars? Or even talented enough to be part of the main squad? Do they underrate our players so low that they think lots of academy players would made it to the top by now? I hope someone revisits this thread next season and count the number of fans who will change their mind again when RLC gets some playing time. They have been wrong so many times. But, they still spew the same rubbish. They are always so sure what our manager will do or won't do. They keep on saying that we will never promote youngsters or play any of these young players we buy almost every season. They said the same thing when we signed Zouma. They said Salah was rubbish and that he can't even play for a team like Everton. I am quite amazed by how some of these fans still made excuses when Zouma played for us and Salah ended up doing so well at the club we loaned him to. Just look at the biggest teams in EPL and count how many players from their academy are part of their starting 11. They make it seem like it is only Chelsea that rarely promote players from the academy. John Terry name always comes up. But, no one mentions Liverpool when they only had Gerrard as their only academy player (when Carragher retired). Now, they have Jordan Ibe and Raheem Sterling who were signed from QPR and Wycombe Wanderers respectively and most of them brag about promoting those players from their academy. Every big team was chasing Sterling when Liverpool signed him. If we were just promoting young players from our academy, we would have had long barren years like Arsenal. Of all the praises Arsenal received over the years for their academy, they still haven't produced a world class player since Ashley Cole. Fabregas came from Barcelona.

&gt;Then, as now, part of the softening-up process is accomplished by employing politically correct euphemisms to hide plain facts. The reclusive Turkish warlord, Oman Pasha, who has taken the estate next to Ivywood’s, and who, with Ivywood’s assistance, is secretly building a Turkish army in England, is referred to by naïve neighbors as the “Mediterranean gentleman.”

&gt;Recently, for example, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the President of Turkey, claimed that Muslims were the first to discover America and this, no doubt, will soon be taken seriously by Western educators. 

&gt;In the England of Chesterton’s imagining, polygamy was just a gleam in Lord Ivywood’s eye. Nowadays, for all intents and purposes, it is an institution.

&gt;One of the things Western citizens take comfort in when contemplating Islamic radicalism is that we possess powerful armies and well-trained police. Once again, Chesterton skewers our illusions. As it turns out, the England of The Flying Inn has been disarming itself militarily as well as culturally. It gradually dawns on the citizenry that police are few and far between, and many of those who remain have taken to wearing Turkish fezzes. 

&gt;I don’t know if the British police are declining in number, but whatever their number, they have become one of the most politically correct organizations on the planet. For example, the London Metropolitan Police Authority recruitment target for 2009-10 required that 27 percent of all new recruits must be black and minority ethnic and 41 percent must be female.

My answer to OP would be to call yourself English and tell anyone who contradicts you to go fuck themselves. Nationality, to me, is less about fitting a mould, and more about the amalgamation of the values/interests/etc. of everyone who identifies with that nationality.

Please stfu. No one considered Walcott a ""generational"" talent or anything of that sort. 

But he has done just fine as a player. In his best season before getting injured he scored 20+ goals and assistsed 15+ times. 


&gt;More game time isn't always what a young player needs. 

This is a truly BS argument. Plenty of young players out there who are thriving because of the game time they got at a young age. In fact, it's safe to say playing at a higher competition and getting experience is a good thing. Obviously you have to look out for overplaying them.

But let's be honest, as a Chelsea player, RLC is hardly looking to get game time week in week out. You're hardly putting his future at risk because of injuries, or high expectations.

null,false,MouMoneyMouProblem,null,null,null,"It's not that people believe Chelsea's policy can't change, it's that people are skeptical and are taking the position of 'believe it when they see it', which is perfectly reasonable. People bring up the whole ""well which players haven't we played that have gone on to be great"", but to an extent it is a self fulfilling prophecy. Chelsea don't give young players a chance so they never reach the heights they potentially could, so people say 'well they were obviously never good enough'. McEachran is an example of that in my opinion, at 17 he looked more than comfortable playing for Chelsea in the Champions League, but a series of managerial changes and constant stream of loans has made his career stagnate. People will say 'well he obviously was never good enough', but with the right coaching at Chelsea and had he continued to get game time he may well be part of the squad today, that never happened though. Another option is Bertrand, realistically he should be our back up left back now playing the games Luis is and we'd have saved ourselves £18m on a 29 year old foreign left back. 


People don't want to replace the entire first 11 with youth players, but what they want is the best youth players to be given a chance to fill out the squad. Man United under Ferguson is the ideal example, players like Fletcher, Evans, Brown, O'Shea, Welbeck etc, none world class players, but all players that have come from their academy and played pretty big roles in securing trophies for Man United, supplemented by world class signings. That's the end game people are looking for, and it has to start by giving at least one youth player an opportunity. 


If Loftus-Cheek does become that first player to be given opportunities it isn't an ""I told you so"" moment for you, people have good reason to be skeptical. Ultimately we'll all have to wait and see what happens, but in terms of Mourinho I'm not very interested in what he has to say about the academy players, I'm interested in what he does about them.

Now he was very talented in the youth ranks at Spurs, got a lot of goals there, and was hyped, but no one would truly have guessed he would have the break out season he has had this year. When you look at his loan spells in League 1, the Championship, and even a short loan in the Premier League, he never really set the world alight. At Chelsea he would have been assumed to be not good enough and that would be that, the fans would agree and talk about how if he can't score in the Championship he obviously can't make it in the Premier League etc. 


It's an extreme example because we're yet to know if Kane will keep up his goal scoring long term, and his rise has been pretty fucking fast, but there are other players that have started out poorly at their clubs but been persevered with and turned into useful players. Fletcher at Man United is another example, hated by the fans to begin with and see as not good enough, Fergie persevered and now, rightly or wrongly, the United fans blame the 2009 Champions League Final loss on Fletcher being suspended. 


Having said all that I don't think Chelsea have particularly wasted their youth, yet. The academy was only truly revamped in the last 10 years and that takes time for the quality of player to filter through to be old enough for the first team. I think McEachran's career was poorly handled due to the manager carousel, and I think Bertrand should still be at the club, though he isn't really a Chelsea academy player. Going forward though when I look at some of the youth players, Chalobah, Loftus-Cheek, Solanke, Boga, Baker, if we can't get at least one squad player out of that then we've fucked up, Mourinho has fucked up, and we may as well just stop talking about promoting youth to the first team and accept the academy is just there to make some money off of player sales.

First off welcome to Edinburgh uni! You're going to love it.
 In terms of hiking and going on hobbit like adventures around the highlands I know a lot of people go off camping on weekends and a lot of societies have trips up to Loch Lomond. There's also a few societies dedicated to hiking and hillwalking you might want to check out. You can always travel by bus or train around Scotland as well. Although Edinburgh isn't quite as mountainous as the highlands there are some fun little day hikes you can do around the city like Pentland Hills or Arthurs Seat that you might want to try out. 
As for getting to Edinburgh from the continent you could always take the train up. I believe it's about as expensive as a plane ticket  and if you take the train up from London you get to see a lot of the English countryside which is always nice. There will definitely be a lot of ferry options as well you just have to look around for the best deals.

null,false,phishsticker,lfc68,,null,"I just saw that we have 38 less goals than we did at the same point last season. We are 7 goals behind united for the season as well and they have been playing some pretty grim football for the majority of the season. Even if Sturridge was at his best, I feel we are really lacking someone else who is a constant threat in front of goal. Sterling is a very poor finisher, Coutinho is inconsistent in front of goal, Lallana the same, and we can't seem to score from corners / fks like we used to. With the race for top 4 so close, GD could be extremely important and we are very far behind the other teams above us. On top of that, we tend to have 2-3 strikers on the bench each week which BR does not seem to trust one bit to offer anything. 

It will be interesting to see what happens this summer. I can see Balotelli and Borini leaving (as well as Lambert if he chooses). It seems like BR has made up his mind that they aren't good enough considering Sterling is ahead of them for the striker position, and he's clearly not got the finishing ability to be a good striker. It's unfortunate that Balotelli hasn't been really given a chance to play alongside Sturridge because I think that is where he will excel. Origi will be coming back in the summer, who doesn't look ready to be playing for a side trying to maintain top 4 so I think it's one of the positions we really need to get sorted this summer. Origi has talent, but hopefully it doesn't turn into another situation similar to Borini. We can't have 4 strikers, with only 1 being trusted to play every match because as we've seen it's a disaster waiting to happen once again.

There is no such thing as a free lunch, if you think there is you are either an externaliser or you are deluded or both. Do you go to restaurants eat loads and climb out the toilet window?

If you think we can just borrow and borrow and borrow and borrow who exactly is going to pay for this? It is future generations and the unborn therefore they are born with debts hence externalisation.

While you might think oh we pay bog all interest (about 42bn a year out of a 500bn tax take) there is a little issue called faith. Which the currency relies upon.

If you notice the UK economy is smoke and mirrors it is mostly retail. While there are some industries like aerospace and pharma such industries are not capable of sustaining the economy at all. Our biggest export is food btw which has a trade deficit. Which is why politicians try blow housing bubbles because that is all we have.

There comes a point where others simply lose faith. Back in 2009 we had a failed bond auction. Individuals might say it was tiny failure but it caused the BoE to print money Zimbabwe style TNSTAAFL this was paid for in a living standards drop. It pissed a lot of people off. Especially people in China, if you understood Chinese and listened to some of the radio shows about money printing there was much bile.

So how did they react? They formed investment banks and simply started buying up infrastructure instead. You might notice a Chinese investment bank owns several UK water companies and they are set to buy more. If you've ever seen the Chinese rent seeking class they will absolutely pound the shit out of you with fees and charges. Just having a Chinese bank account they charge me for anything and everything. It is not uncommon for rents to go up every 3 months. You think the UK government will enact laws to prevent this?

You're one of those borrow as much as possible! To hell with the consequences! 

Borrowing a lot in dire economic times only works IF it involves buying transformational infrastructure. I.e capital investment which has **returns** the UK borrows money to pay the day to day bills. The UK borrows money to inflate GDP.

You need only to look at the differences between the party's 2010 manifesto and its current one to recognise that they are essentially a two issue party (withdrawal from the EU and reducing immigration). Everything else is just an attempt to seem legitimate and woo the middle ground voters as far as I can tell. 

For example, the amount of flip-flopping done by UKIP around the time of the same sex marriage legislation tells me that the decision not to overturn them (should they get into power) is one based in popularism, and doesn't *really* reflect the views of UKIP's members. What they are saying and what they potentially intend to vote for/against are seemingly two different things. 

I understand your point; in an ideal world, the biases of the individual wouldn't affect their ability to do their job, but I don't think that really applies in politics. You don't elect a professional voter, you elect somebody representative of your views based on your judgement of their character and political leaning, in addition to proposals outlined in a manifesto. By voting for a known homophobe, you are endorsing that behaviour and telling them that you hold similar beliefs and want legislation passed that reflects those beliefs. 

I think the issue of overturning gay marriage (for now at least) is out of the window, and that UKIP were never extreme enough to propose recriminalising homosexuality. But the fact remains that you'd be electing a member of a party that openly harbours homophobia, and the person you have elected is quite likely to take an anti-progressive stance on any LGBT issues that come up in the duration of the parliament.

We see the same things happen across all layers of society because we don't punish fraud adequately enough. Fining people for 20% or 50% of the amount they've stolen isn't enough to make it unprofitable, this logic applies whether it's a big business or an individual.

It's an interesting read, and not too long. He actually goes into some good detail with regards to his world view, which I haven't seen set out so systematically before.

It's a very strange mix. The titular ""enormous shortcoming"" of our economic system is its inability to take environmental damage into account as an economic phenomenon. He doesn't use the word, but this is well known in economics as ""negative externalities"", so what he's saying is a) nothing revolutionary b) nothing offensive.

He has some good insights and ways of phrasing things:

&gt; we cannot have any form of capitalism without capital.  But we must remember that the ultimate source of all economic capital is Nature’s capital.  Our ability to adapt to the effects of climate change, and then perhaps even to reduce those effects, depends upon us adapting our pursuit of “unlimited” economic growth to that of “sustainable” economic growth.

But unfortunately occasionally dips into anti-science nonsense:

&gt;Modern agri-industry, for instance, may have made enormous strides to feed the burgeoning world’s population, but at a huge and unsustainable cost to ecosystems, through massive use of artificial fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and water.    It is a reductive approach to one issue that is patently not durable because it sustains nothing but its own decline, solving one problem by creating countless others.

null,false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,null,"From the sack to England manager, eh?

First off, yes, I think that Rodgers would be the perfect man for the England job at some point in the future. Why? Because of the following ... 

* Rodgers possesses a healthy nostalgia and romanticism for the past.
* Which is well-balanced by his progressive approach to the game in terms of tactics, medical staff, training program, mental health, etc. etc.
* Along with his unique talent to motivate and encourage his squad.
* His steadfast (or stubborn, depending on whose side you're on) attitude enables him to do what he feels is best no matter what supporters or the media may say.
* His ability to endear himself to supporters *and* his bosses.

All of these qualities, I feel, make him a perfect candidate for the England job.

All that is missing is the tangible success. i.e. Titles, trophies.

In spite of all of the criticism of Rodgers, look at what he has accomplished:

* 2012-13: Rodgers accepted the job as Liverpool manager and showed the required reverence for the club and its history especially following the unceremonious sacking of LFC legend Kenny Dalglish. Yet, there was still doubt and suspicion about his abilities.
* 2013-14: Rodgers brilliantly navigated LFC to a 2nd place finish and nearly won the title. Yet, in the following summer, his decisions were once again met with doubt especially considering the many changes made to the squad.
* 2014-15: Within a few months of the new season, Rodgers has suddenly lost has ability to manage and is threatened with the sack. Yet, FSG keep their heads, and Rodgers turns it around and is now being hailed as brilliant once again and even mentioned as a future England manager.

Is there still doubt now?

Hicks and Gillett nearly drove a once mighty club to the brink of irrelevance. At one point, I actually feared that Liverpool FC would be mentioned in the same breath as Leeds United: Once mighty clubs who fell upon dire times with no hope in sight.

But then we went from awful and ambivalent American ownership to another brand of American ownership committed to engaging with the club's history, the supporters and the community even in spite of their admitted inexperience.

One has to respect the fearless nature of FSG: So willing to understand the culture yet having the confidence to sack a legend like Dalglish and support a relative unknown like Brendan Rodgers.

Of course, as supporters, we are impatient. We glorify our history and expect so much from our owners, our youth, our manager. But our two steps forward -- going from 7th to 2nd -- seems to have been met with a frustrating three steps back -- 2nd to sack Rodgers to Rodgers is brilliant to ... who knows.

To get so close to the title was heartbreaking. Even moreso knowing that this is Steven Gerrard's final season in a Liverpool shirt.

But ... I'm not interested in immediate success. I am interested in long-term sustained success. And I am confident that our ownership and Brendan Rodgers have established the foundation for that long-term success.

Last summer, I commented many times that I expect 2014-15 to be a transitional season and I tempered my expectations. However, in the same breath, I would also say that I fully expect 2015-16 to be the season where Liverpool FC introduces their return to dominance with the steady forward progress of Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson, Coutinho, the additions to Anfield, etc. etc.

I believe.

It may seem crazy now, but I believe that within 2-4 seasons, Liverpool will win at least one title and at least one Champions League trophy.

And -- going back to the original subject -- if Rodgers secures a title or two and a Champions League under his belt, I fully believe that Rodgers can leave LFC for the England job knowing that he has established a system for long-term success.

[ActionAid](http://www.actionaid.org.uk/fundraise/visit-our-projects-around-the-world) would be a good one to look at. I am going to help on a project with them next year.

I was iffy about voluntourism as well, but I think if it's a responsibly-managed project and you go in with the right mindset - that is, knowing that your contribution is minimal and you're not 'saving' anyone - then there's no harm in it. You will create a bit of benefit and you'll gain personal growth from the experience.

In real terms, if you want to have the maximum possible benefit for your chosen country/community, then you would just donate as much money as you can save/raise. If you're insistent on being 'involved' personally, then you are likely being motivated by your own benefit as well as theirs - and there's nothing really wrong with that.

Why is this preferable to the people doing the work getting the money?

Why does Russell think private companies should answer to the government about how highly they pay their employees? Or is it exclusively ""da banks!!!""?


Also, wasn't the move from the EU to ban bonuses widely accepted to be a move against the city?

Yet the other posters here are suggesting we can borrow to cover deficits indefinitely at zero cost without consequences.

The old future growth will cover the cost is bullshit.

A-L=C

Assets - Liabilities = capital

Do that with GDP and borrowing for the last 35 years. There have been TWO periods of growth in the last 35 years where A-L=C where A exceeds L. One short month in 1982 and 3 months in 1988.

Many cyclists own cars, on which a vehicle excise duty (VED) is paid (basically a pollution tax). If you are referring to the ""road tax"", then this was abolished in 1937. VED, contrary to popular opinion, does not entitle you to use the roads, or even pay for their upkeep, it is a tax on the emissions that car produces. So, no one is actually taxed for using the road.

If he were overtaking with a safe margin, the cyclist would have to swerve a good 2 metres to get hit. Do the jury think the cyclist did that then?

**Brendan Rodgers placed trust in unfamiliar 3-4-3 formation after watching Basle beat his Liverpool side... he has worked through problems in methodical and meticulous way**

*It was during what would prove another crushing defeat that a possible solution to Liverpool’s problems earlier this season would first present itself to Brendan Rodgers.*

*His side were playing away to Basle in the Champions League, in a game they would lose 1-0, and Liverpool’s manager noted a change in the Swiss side’s tactical approach that he believes emerged quite by accident.*

*On the night it was reported that the loss of Basle's left back to injury after only four minutes forced Paulo Sousa to switch to a back three, with an attacking midfielder in Derlis Gonzalez coming on to replace the unfortunate Behrang Safari.*

*But Rodgers would note how Sousa would grow increasingly impatient with Gonzalez’s reluctance to cover the right-back position, instead choosing to push forward and fill the space previously occupied by a right winger now being forced to play more centrally.*

*Essentially, Basle began to employ a 3-4-3 formation and Rodgers flew home with his team that night – defeated and more than a little disappointed by his team’ s ineptitude – thinking how difficult that particular tactical approach was to play against.*

*It was not the way Rodgers did things. In the comprehensive 180-page dossier Rodgers has written on how a football club should be managed – a document he shared with Liverpool’s American owners when he was interviewed for the job and one he circulates to his most senior members of staff – his philosophy is built around 4-3-3 and the 4-4-2 diamond formation. Dating back to taking his first steps in coaching at Reading’s academy, it was how Rodgers wanted his teams to play.*

*But Basle's approach that night remained in his thoughts, even if things would get an awful lot worse before they got better.*

*He would first experiment with a back three against Newcastle a month after that encounter with Basle, and it would not prove terribly successful. Liverpool would lose 1-0. One report would describe them as toothless, with much of the blame directed towards Mario Balotelli.*

*The controversial Italian has proved a major disappointment to his manager. Rodgers had signed him out of desperation after losing Luis Suarez to Barcelona. He thought he had Alexis Sanchez but the Chilean wanted to live in London and opted for Arsenal instead.* 

*The move for Loic Remy had fallen through over concerns for the player’s health. So Rodgers was faced with going into a Champions League season with a rather fragile Daniel Sturridge and Rickie Lambert. He took an expensive gamble on Balotelli, and lost.*

*Before signing the former Manchester City and Inter Milan striker he spent three and a half hours with him in his office, explaining both to Balotelli and his agent what would be expected of him.*

*He talked him through what Rodgers describes as his CORE principles. Commitment, Ownership, Responsibilities, Excellence. He explained in more detail what each one means. How a player had to take ownership of his role and responsibility for his own destiny.* 

*He scribbled a picture of a man with a crown on his head; because everyone is the king of their own destiny. He explained that the application of these four principles was the way to achieve consistency, comparing it to the role of a neuro surgeon whose fifth operation of the day needed to be every bit as good as his first.*

*But Balotelli wasn’t listening, and the lack of respect Rodgers feels Balotelli has shown Liverpool is why he will not be at the club next season.*

*His failure to follow even the simplest instructions has been a huge source of frustration. Rodgers believes in playing with intensity and pressing high up the field. ‘Hunt and suffocate’ he calls it. It is essential the striker pressers high. But Balotelli would not make those runs and would not even be in position to lead a counter attack when Liverpool won the ball.*

*The nadir for Rodgers would nevertheless come in Balotelli’s absence. The 3-1 defeat at Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park in late November. Lambert would lead the attack but his team remained desperately poor. Defensively they were awful. Rodgers was starting to come under serious pressure, and he was embarrassed that his team was so far removed from what he felt he represented.*

*He locked himself away in his office for the next few days, occasionally calling his staff in to discuss what he was thinking but essentially working through the problem on his own. One night he was up at 3am, making himself tea and toast before scribbling down his thoughts.*

*The plan he came up with needed to be executed in two stages. He knew he first needed to steady the ship by slowing things down and employing a bit of experience in players like Kolo Toure. Liverpool picked up some results as a consequence. They beat Stoke and Leicester City.*

*But the idea was to use that 3-4-3 formation he had seen in Basle with Raheem Sterling providing the pace – and with it the ability to press – at the pinnacle of Liverpool’s attack.*

*Against Manchester United – the team Liverpool meet again on Sunday - it actually worked better than the scoreline suggested; a thumping 3-0 win for Louis van Gaal’s side led to more unflattering headlines for Rodgers but the Ulsterman saw enough to be encouraged. Had David De Gea not been quite so outstanding in United’s goal, Sterling might have made more of an impact than he did.*

*That defeat by United, on December 14, would prove the last Liverpool have suffered in the Premier League and a turning point in their season. It was also the day Rodgers dropped Simon Mignolet and he began a series of one-to-one sessions - something he does with all his players – that would enable his goalkeeper to return both more confident and with a better understanding of what his manager required.*

*With results quickly improving the team would evolve, with the decision to put Emre Can – a player essentially signed as a midfielder – into his three-man defence one Rodgers felt would address certain flaws that remained at the back.* 

*Now reflecting on a six straight games without conceding a goal, it has proved something of a masterstroke but one that was not as ambitious as some might have thought. When they were scouting Can both Rodgers and his staff had seen the German play in defence; indeed Rodgers had even seen reference to it in Pep Guardiola’s book.* 

*If Rodgers takes pride in Can, he derives a real pleasure from the development of Jordan Henderson; the midfielder whose emergence as a midfield leader is making the imminent departure of Steven Gerrard that much more palatable for everyone on the red half of Merseyside.* 

*Soon after Rodgers arrived at Liverpool an offer came in from Fulham for Henderson. Rodgers had a duty to tell him and recognised that, yes, after a difficult first season at Anfield he might secure more regular first team football at Craven Cottage. But he also told Henderson that, if he stayed, he would make him a better player.*

*Rodgers likes British players and he does not buy into the idea that they lack the technical ability of their European counterparts. He thinks tactical awareness is the problem, and he blames the weather as much as anything because tactical coaching is difficult in the winter months when players just need to keep warm.*

*With the academy staff Rodgers has already addressed this with the club’s nine to 16-year-olds. They now have the second half of December and January off but remain at the academy right through to mid-July, when the weather is more suited to slowing things down and teaching kids what Rodgers calls the ‘tactical concepts’ properly. Simple but very clever.*

*A bright man, Rodgers is also tough. His career has rocketed at a time when he has had to endure much heartache off the field. He lost both his parents and had to support his son, Anton, through two Old Bailey trials.*

*The moment in Court One of the Old Bailey just before the verdict, when the QC suggested Anton hand his personal belongings to his parents in case he didn’t leave with them, will forever haunt Rodgers even if his son was eventually acquitted.*

*Perhaps such challenges in his private life enabled him to apply a bit of perspective to the professional difficulties he encountered earlier this season.*

*But Rodgers is methodical and meticulous and the way he worked through those problems is arguably more impressive than the unexpected success he enjoyed last season when his team finished second in the league to Manchester City.*

*It’s a tired description of a manager but he is a student of the game who most admires the innovators like Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff; who reads as well as writes and updates a managerial manual based on ‘one vision, one club’.*

*He swears by Dr Steve Peters, the sports psychiatrist who provides support that he recognises a manager simply can’t give his players. And he is so focused on delivering that elusive first Premier League title for Liverpool that an offer from Manchester City this season would almost certainly be rejected. Only if he thought the title was beyond Liverpool’s reach would he even contemplate leaving.*

*He dreams of one day managing at a World Cup. Perhaps even for England. But not at 42. Not for another 20 years. Not when he is enjoying the job he has as much as he does.*

It's quite simple. Modern society and economies are comprised of human beings that, unlike trees, are capable of moving around freely. These societies and economies naturally require and facilitate a fair amount of movement to function properly. To completely shut down the movement of peoples between states would not only be unnatural, it would begin to impair all of the above. Therefore, to an extent migration is completely and utterly unavoidable, there will always be a certain amount of it. That's why I think we should allow immigrants into our country, and emigrants out. 

With regard to non-EU migration, I think we can and should be as strict as possible, as we have complete say in this matter. I don't understand how unskilled peoples from non-EU countries are actually allowed in, and I think this is something we should continue to remain vigilant of. In regard to EU countries, I feel the overall economic and cultural benefits outweigh the negatives, as most of the EU does share very similar culture to ourselves, and any peoples that do not, should in theory be engaged by progressive views and society and brought in line through the exchange of cultures. Shutting down part of the EU and refusing to engage these people is a reactionary short sighted knee jerk cop out imo.

Banging on about ""cultural enrichment"" &amp; ""stupid middle class liberals"" is just a weazel argument. Immigration is completely and utterly unavoidable. Using it as a stick to beat ""liberals"" with, every time an opportunity occurs to crow bar in a few criticisms of immigration, with out any sort of nuance whatsoever, is the argument of someone refusing to look at the bigger picture and hell bent on a blinkered agenda. We can and should discuss immigration and managing the cultures that come into Britain and live along side and intertwine with our own. I don't particularly want to, nor care about, letting in more immigrants. I just understand it is inherently the way human society functions.

But people that bang on about how bad immigration is all the time, are simply not living in the real world. They are not providing any sort of intelligence to the discussion, nor anything constructive. It's just completely and utterly useless rhetoric. They don't want to actually talk about immigration. They just want to repeat the same fucking criticism ad infinitum. Your comment for example; absolutely zero useful information in there. Everything I've just said is quite easy for anyone to see. But this comment:

&gt;I really can't understand the thought processes of these people.

Shows that you really don't care to think about the issue very much. I really can't understand your thought process tbh. We should control immigration as much as we can, I agree. But using any opportunity you can to rub multiculturalism in the face of ""liberals"" makes me think that you don't really give a fuck about anything other than short sighted us vs. them politics of left vs right.",null,0,null,1426943259,null,0,1426944261,0,cplypxt,null,t3_2zqklo,null,t1_cplypxt,null,t1_cpljp3l,null,null,null,1431930791,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

* Clarkson is a star for the BBC
* Top Gear makes a lot of money for the BBC
* Clarkson is going through a divorce, causing stress
* Clarkson needs hip replacements on both hips
* Several of the top BBC Execs hate Clarkson for his non-politically correct view. Also the fact that rather than being a Labour luvvie he's friends with Cameron.

now

* It possibly/probably was a long day's filming, with them staying out, *on location*, to get the shots required on take number X? They got to the hotel at 10pm so when did they leave the shoot? 9pm?
* Clarkson was probably cold, hungry and looking forward to a nice warm/hot food and bed. Not to mention sore/in pain
* One of the producers jobs is to make sure things run smoothly

What I've surmised/guessed at, is that, having stayed out to get the job done, Clarkson assumed that someone (the producer?) would have ensured that there was a hot meal available **not soup** when they got back. Now stressed out, Clarkson looses it. Was this the right thing to do? No. But to an extent I can understand it.

But in mitigation, it has to be said that the BBC weren't really supporting/managing/helping/minding their star? Remember he's under a lot of stress and pain due to marriage break-up/hips. I think the BBC would be well aware of this

Should Clarkson be sacked, probably not. (The BBC Saville comparison hasn't help one iota)  The BBC **may** have failed in a duty of care to help/support Clarkson, prior to this incident.

I buy food for my local foodbank, because just a year ago, thanks to this government, I was living on around £50 for a fortnight and couldn't even afford food, and to boot had tried to kill myself twice. Ever been that low mate? Because I'm assuming that while you have the fucking *audacity* to moralise to me with your holier than thou subtext, you've lived a hard life. If not, seriously. Off you fuck. Don't ever talk to me again.

 Comic relief was *nowhere to be fucking seen*, but good Christian organisations that get their food directly from people with a sense of social responsibility and awareness gave *what they had* - no matter how little. I'd be dead or starving right now if I didn't have them.

That's no thanks to the government; no thanks to Lenny; the people in my *community* looked after me, and that's the way it should be *first and foremost*, while we're figuring out the best knot to use for the noose we should apply to each and every politician that's in westminster for a career option rather than a genuine desire to serve.

""In a way, this is a part of the world that doesn't really belong, ie Britain or Ireland, so you could maybe empathise with that""

I've always felt that way. I may have been brought up in England but it was by a Northern Irish father and family, I was brought up a unionist and to hate and love Ian paisley. I can cook a mean Ulster fry, can home make fadge and ate malt loaf while the other kids ate cheese strings. 
Point is I was not brought up English I was brought up a mix, I see my parents thinking in that, allowing me to choose, but it didn't really work out like that. I kinda refused all of the titles in fear of being reject by any of them. Understandably those who have a sense of a ""people"" don't give it a second thought but for a young kid who is suffering racism at school cos they are Chinese and racism at home because they are not Chinese etc it can feel very lonely.

Now i'm starting a family of my own I'm wanting to connect with some sort of heritage, I have blood in my veins and it belongs somewhere. Don't get me wrong, I don't see it as the most important thing in the world, I want my child to be proud they'll also be mixed race, but I also want them to feel like they have people, somewhere they can go to be accepted, rejected, and considered the same as everyone else.",null,0,null,1426946663,null,0,false,0,cplzrk9,null,t3_2zrq88,null,t1_cplzrk9,null,t1_cplqkb0,null,null,null,1431931284,null,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3,null

null,false,ThisDoesntFookinSlip,lfc68,,null,"I think we will play 343 with our best 11. That means whatever 11 that does not contain Gerrard. And maybe Sturridge. We will start off strong, but then our bald pitch will start to hinder our ball play on the ground and disrupt our trademark passing game. Nerves, crowd pressure, and the weight of the rivalry will combine to interfere with the lads' basic footballing faculties. These factors, all things considered, will lead to a shite first half with two goals conceded. 0-2. /r/reddevils will erupt in fervent laughter and gibe through eyes teary with glee that we were so damn wise not to accept the reddit bet. 

But no matter, BR will deliver an inspirational half-time talk that will make the lads jizz without physical simulation (or maybe with some; who knows BR's methods?), and we will recover our form in the second half to dazzle the crowd. Sterling will show the world why he deserves 150k a week. Coutinho will deliver a magician's performance that puts Hogwarts and Gandalf to shame. Hendo will inadvertently invent, via natural internal biological processes borne of raw desire, blood and sweat-fueled combustion engine technology that will go on to win 25 patents. Can will give the best box-to-box-to-box center-back performance of his life. Skrtel will be Skrtel. Mamadou what Mamadoes. Jasmine will send raunchy videos of her touching her naked self to Mig's mobile at half time to remind him of the heaven that awaits him after the game. Confidence and cock skyrocket.

And so along the second half we bang in two goals to tie up the score. 2-2.

Now, say what you want about Utd, they know how to defend and play for scraps — especially on big occasions when their arses are pressed to the wall so hard some swear they can see imprints. Once we start to look like we can tear the scum a new arsehole at will, they will dog our frontline and defend for their lives before having their wingers charge forward like crazed bulldogs in desperate counterattacking maneuvers. They will hoof balls to Fellaini and hope they snap up the first, second, third, fourth and fifth balls. Or dive when they don't. Somewhere along the way, we will concede a phony penalty and the scum will regain their ill-deserved lead. 2-3.

Then the boss introduces Stevie G. He proceeds to galvanize our troops, and eventually scores our winner with a volleyed rising screamer so perversely powerful, it penetrates the top of de Gea's net, soars past the Kop, and flies all the way into the net of Goodison Park. Because Stevie's shot technically flew into the net twice, we are awarded two goals. 

We win 4-3.

Where did you get that from? I think when it happened in Blink, it was just a coincidence. Detective Shipton is the *only* Angel victim to have died on the day he disappeared, that we know of for sure.

I think they would have gotten married again because they ended up sharing their tombstone, which means they share their plot at the cemetery. They wouldn't be able to do that if they hadn't proven that they were related, which they are, because they are married. And they couldn't prove that they were married in 1938, because they got married (and got the legal documents proving it) in 2010. Granted, I know nothing of how sharing a plot works, but I assume that you need some sort of relation to do it.

What does River say again?

Way to lose the point. I'm not bothered that they didn't help me honestly. I'm not black, female or retarded; as such, I don't matter in the UK these days. Hell, some days it feels like I barely register as human.

Comic relief doesn't do enough. It doesn't achieve anywhere *near* the amount of effectiveness that simply tapping on the doors of the vulnerable on your street, recognising that they need help, and offering to have them over for tea. We used to do that *all the time* in this country for crying out loud! When did we as a nation, as *humans* become so fucking cold, dense and oblivious to the problems around us?

Here's a way to solve both problems at once - cut the aid to india, because they've even SAID they don't need it anymore, and instead of pissing that money in the wind like Comic Relief are akin today so that Ricky Gervais can continue to guilt trip you while wearing a smug fucking grin every two years - invest in irrigation and desalination plants to provide clean, sustainable land and long term crop options, and even solar technology to give them power. Then, while the government's patting themselves on the back about how oh so terribly good we all are, and how compassionate we are, *start healing this country*.

I'll share something with you - from one gobshite to...Someone utterly deluded. The last time I tried killing myself, I'd had about a bottle of vodka I'd stolen, and swallowed all of my pills. everything I could find in the house; as my consciousness faded, and my thoughts drifted towards the few people that even *knew I existed* in the world, I started thinking about the moments of joy in the world - the time I'd spent travelling, and those little moments when people shared what they had with me. It made me realise that I love this world; I'm truly, completely and irredeemably taken by it - I find it breathtakingly and extraordinarily beautiful, but I find the way we as a species can be towards each other sometimes absolutely sickening.

I called an ambulance at that point, and they arrived just in time to get me to hospital for...Well, a not very nice experience and a psych eval.

People need to wake up. We don't need organisations like comic relief. We don't *need* to look to others to shine a light; we just need to feel that moment of grace and embrace the better part of our nature. I promise you, it's there, and it's far more effective than a telethon.

null,false,Firefox7275,null,null,null,"**Name of product:** Simple KTS+ Protecting Moisture Cream SPF 30

**Price of product:** £2.70 for 50ml

**Where did you purchase:** Boots on three for two offer

**Product claims:** *""Kind To Skin+ is more than everyday skincare. It’s a range of products with the same Simple goodness and skin loving ingredients as the trusted Kind To Skin range but with added benefits. We’re talking illuminating, protecting, brightening, perfecting and moisture boosting skincare treats ...*

*Perfect blend of multi-vitamins and skin loving ingredients with SPF protection to give dehydrated and dull skin a boost whilst protecting from UVA/ UVB rays. Perfect even for sensitive skin.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because a couple of the regulars rate it and because [NICE recommends rosaceans use a minimum of SPF 30.] (http://cks.nice.org.uk/rosacea#!scenario)

**Your opinion:**  Although this product claims to be broad spectrum I cannot find a star rating on the bottle or outer box. Appreciate the pump packaging which should keep the sunscreen filters fresher for longer.

The ingredients are a real chemical soup, but there are some nice actives tucked away. Although it is based on chemical filters dimethicone is the second ingredient, and research suggests silicones reduce skin irritation in people with rosacea.

I have been using two pumps for face neck and decollete: the cream goes on with a white cast and does not initially massage in easily. However go about your business for a few minutes and the cream soaks in leaving a dewy finish. As a moisturiser it is quite rich which could lead some to use less that the recommended amount or not reapply. No smell at all.

I don't love this but the value for money cannot be denied, overall a far superior product to the Simple Day Cream SPF 15. I would recommend it to anyone on a budget who does not have oily or hypersensitive skin.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, dimethicone, ethylhexyl salicylate (UVB), glycerin, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (UVA), butylene glycol, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (UVB), PEG-100 stearate, glyceryl stearate, niacinamide, polymethylsilsesquioxane, titanium dioxide (UVA/ UVB), sweet almond oil, caprylyl methicone, vitamin E, hydrogenated polydecene, dimethiconol, allantoin, lactic acid, serine, sodium lactate, urea, sorbitol, propylene glycol, carrageenan, cetearyl alcohol, coco-glucoside, potassium cetyl phosphate, palmitic acid, stearic acid, trideceth-10, citric acid, sodium polyacryloyldimethyl taurate, coconut alcohol, magnesium aluminum silicate, sodium chloride, PVP, disodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, pentylene glycol, propylparaben, sodium dehydroacetate, chlorphenesin, sodium ascorbyl phosphate, BHT, silica, aluminum hydroxide.""*

null,false,Firefox7275,null,null,null,"**Name of product:** Simple KTS Vital Vitamin Day Cream SPF 15

**Price of product:** £2.50 for 50ml

**Where did you purchase:** Superdrug on half price offer

**Product claims:** *""The Simple Kind To Skin range offers everything from daily cleansers and moisturisers to occasional treats such as face masks. Formulated with vitamin goodness ...*

*A perfect blend of multi-vitamins and skin-loving ingredients with SPF protection to keep your skin moisturised and protected from UVA &amp; UVB rays. It also gives you hydration for 12 hours, perfect even for sensitive skin.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because I am slightly obsessed with niacinamide, and was intrigued by the combination of bisabolol and ginger root extract which both have anti aging properties.

**Your opinion:** Although this product claims to be 'broad spectrum' I cannot find a star rating on the jar; given the SPF it likely also affords low UVA protection. The tub packaging is not the most hygienic nor protects the antioxidants. On the plus side it does not have that characteristic sunscreen smell.

This cream goes on with a white cast and does not initially massage in easily. However go about your business for a few minutes and the moisturiser soaks in leaving a matte finish.

It is non greasy yet acceptably hydrating and I have not experienced any visible irritation. This has ended up in the back of the bathroom cabinet because I did not enjoy using it. Overall I do not recommend it except in a pinch.

**Ingredients:** *""water, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (UVB), dicaprylyl carbonate, glycerin, hydrogenated polydecene, cetearyl alcohol, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (UVA), dimethicone, butylene glycol, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, niacinamide, bisabolol, sweet almond oil, vitamin E, retinyl palmitate, sunflower seed oil, ginger root extract, stearyl heptanoate, sodium stearoyl glutamate, stearyl caprylate, isomerized linoleic acid, sucrose polystearate, cetyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate, hydrogenated polyisobutene, disodium EDTA, titanium dioxide (UVA/ UVB), aluminum hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, propylparaben, BHT.""*",null,0,null,1426949590,null,0,1426965710,0,cpm0v0y,null,t3_2zt2x7,null,t1_cpm0v0y,null,t1_cpm0dsl,null,null,null,1431931800,null,5,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,5,null

 [**Chocolate gravy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate%20gravy): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__Chocolate gravy__ is a variety of gravy made with fat, flour, cocoa powder and sometimes a small amount of sugar. This variety is more common in [cuisine of the Southern United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_the_Southern_United_States) and is most often served as a Sunday morning dish with fresh [biscuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscuit_(bread\)) in the Ozark and Appalachian Mountain regions. Chocolate gravy was a regular item at [Elvis Presley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley)'s Graceland. Some recipes devised in eastern Oklahoma use more sugar, and the fat comes from the use of butter after the gravy is complete, making it more like warm chocolate pudding served over biscuits. In a traditional gravy, a roux is made with fat and flour before the milk is added; in chocolate gravy all the dry ingredients are mixed first, milk slowly incorporated, then stirred continuously until cooked. When a thick and rich consistency, the butter and vanilla are added. Other ingredients, such as crumbled bacon, are added afterward, usually.

My dad called up the provider, explained I'd be paying the bill, but the account should stay in his name, passed the phone to me and I gave them the new direct debit details.

A couple of weeks later the gas bill arrives addressed to 'Mr Alliance and Leicester'.  Neither of us are named Alliance or Leicester or have every banked with them. Over the next six months no direct debits go from my account or from my parents accounts but the bill is marked as being paid and in credit.

We tried calling them half a dozen times, filling in new DD forms, sending (registered) letters etc. etc. but the just kept sending the bills out to Mr Alliance and his pal Leicester.  

Then, around 12 months later and a few months after I bought the house from my father and switched to another supplier Mr Alliance started getting letters from a debt collection agency for an unpaid gas bill with the original supplier for something like £50.  They wouldn't talk to me because I wasn't the person named on the debt and the old supplier kept referring me back to debt collector.  They sent out a couple of letters a month for a year or so, sent a bloke round with a clipboard who also would 'only discuss the matter with Mr Alliance or Mr Leicester', threatened to take A&amp;L to court a few times then just stopped bothering.

Who's to say if given the chance when they were younger Pardew, Allardichi, Sherwood ect. wouldn't have been able to adapt to managing a big club. Sherwood done decent enough at Spurs but never got any credit since it was short term (understandable). 

8/20 Managers aren't British in the league. Top 6 have only Brendan. Other 3 foreign are Koeman(7th), Martinez(14th) and Advocatt (17th). The most recent long-term manager before that in the top 6 was Redknapp, who was harshly sacked, but got Spurs in the position from his own doing (and maybe a little fortune with Bale/VdV and Modric being so good). Obviously Ferguson too but he was hired in a different era. I wonder if Fenway purposely selected British managers or it was just coincidence that they went through Roy/Kenny/Brendan.

With the league being so dominated by money, it causes lower league players to be stretched across top clubs, no manager really gets a chance at proving himself in Europe or has more than one year in the higher places of the league if they don't have financial power. Even if they make the top clubs look like mugs with transfer fees they still have to find quality players again to keep their strength. If a club like Dortmund came through in England they'd have half their team gone before they could even get Champions league! If they are lucky they'll show enough success for the manager to move on as well like at Southampton last year, or alternatively they'll end up like Villa.

Not exactly true. The SNP isn't stupid and knows it's figures wouldn't have credibility unless they were supported by at least some oil economists and industrial experts. Appealing to a greater, politically neutral authority is actually Salmond's favourite tactic. But aye, I expect the SNP did select the most positive figures for political gain and the No campaign did the opposite. That's what politicians do frankly. They exaggerate and spin.

However the current oil price is well below what anyone predicted or could have predicted. 

&gt;oil is way to volatile now to use as a key component of their economy.

No it isn't. Would you say Norway is economically unstable? What about Canada? 

This drastic price collapse immediately post-referendum is the worst thing that could've happened. Therefore I'm glad independence did not happen.

- Leicester has done their homework on Walker. Supreme athletic ability but poor decision making. They've had a half dozen chance creations just off his poor decisions. Vardy is making his life hell.
- Dier and Vert talking well, can see they're starting to get in sync. 
- Rose is playing like a man possessed. Gotta be honest, he is impressing me big time in the last month. 
- Mason is taking his box-to-box role and not trying to do too much. 
- Chadli is doing his job on the flank, but individual errors are making it hard to not consider bringing him off. He should have buried that chance and the dive was bad. 
- Townsend is clearly being instructed to use his speed. Effective, but I wish he would fool a boy into taking the bait and crossing it over the backline to Kane. 
- Eriksen is being closed out and I'm not impressed with his work-rate today. When we need to be opening up a channel, he isn't naturally moving into it. Perhaps instructed different, can't tell really. 
- Kane. Well Kane. In the right place at the right time for both goals. Second was lucky no doubt. Would like him to use his awareness and physicality to break through those channels but he is always coming deep to collect balls when the midfield is being boxed out. 

Leicester is countering quick and that concerns me, we're having trouble penetrating deep into their third and that means we're losing balls higher up the pitch. Leicester has less ground to cover to counter and if 3-4 players are deep into their half they're not catching up in time. Prime example is Leicester's first goal.

Charging for use of NHS services is so toxic to voters that it will probably never happen, so I am not that worried about it.  


  One thing I am worried about is the reduced accountability of private entities.  Look what happened [when G4S failed to provide the necessary staff for the Olympics in 2012](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/supportservices/10070425/Timeline-how-G4Ss-bungled-Olympics-security-contract-unfolded.html).  If this kind of thing happened on a similar scale in the NHS, hundreds of people could be harmed as a result.


  Another thing I am concerned about is the way that businesses can pull out of something when the going gets tough, and their profits are harmed.  What if your hospital suddenly had no surgeons doing a certain operation, because the company supplying them went bust or decided it was no longer a profitable venture?  A related concern is what happens if a provider seeks to maximise profits by reducing the quality of their service, for example cutting corners in staffing levels, equipment updates, length of aftercare, etc?  [Here's a story](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/14/nhs-eye-operations-private-provider-musgrove) where something went wrong.

I live in China now and although it's not brighton people are openly gay and the younger generation don't make a big fuss about it. There are gay clubs in most places even in the smaller cities and both men and women openly dress androgynously, even more so than in the UK.  The ""homophobia"" here comes from the strong family culture and the strong desire parents have to see their children get married (sham marriages between gays and lesbians are a thing here unfortunately).

However there is very little actual hate here, it mainly ranges from enthusiasm and support to ""meh"" with maybe a few of the older generation saying, ""thats not good how will they have kids"". Chinese people as a rule care more about their own life than other peoples.

What they are not doing is throwing gays off buildings, beheading them, necklacing them, and throwing them in prison. A girl here can cut her hair short, put on boys clothes and hold hands with her girlfriend in public without much fuss. In most majority muslim countries a woman can't even go out in public without covering her hair or even wearing a full burka. The chinese society in my university never handed out leaflets on campus saying homosexuality is a sin and you will go to hell for being one. 

This comment is the standard simplification of the problems we have with diversity in the UK. ""Not all muslims!"" is a perfectly accurate statement, I have great muslim friends who couldn't give a shit who you love, I also have some that really dislike any idea of someone being homosexual. 

What we have to do is actually engage and talk about what values we have as a society. We need to stop thinking of British Muslims as the ""other"" and start talking in a way that acknowledges the fact that they are british and therefore have to not only follow our laws but should come in line with a progressive liberal society. 

The good news is that 2nd and 3rd generation British Muslims are far more likely to be moderate if they are religious at all. I grew up in a mixed white/british indian family and my (step) brother and sister who are 2nd gen Indian certainly don't hold the same values as their grandparents held when they came here. There grandparents for the most part also have changed their values. 

Homophobia doesn't just exist in the Muslim community, the christian community also needs to have a frank discussion and own up to it's own homophobia. We need to stop giving people a free ride in the name of diversity. Everyone in Britian deserves to love who they wan't regardless of what comunity they come from.

Walker was out of position almost the entire match, he's been struggling as well.  Really hope he can find better form going into the last matches of the season.  Our entire defensive back 4 save for Danny need to step it up honestly, especially Jan.

Paulinho actually improved us in the midfield defensively when he was subbed in.  Good performance from him today I feel.  Made some crucial tackles and that run in the 93rd minute sealed the game for us.

Rose was a fucking boss again, I love his current run of form at full back.  Does it all!  Gets in dangerous advanced positions on attack and has been super solid defensively too.  He won a bunch of defensive headers against players massively bigger than him.

Had we sat back and played on the counter we could have exposed the lack of quality in the leicester squad who would have to attack desperately to overcome a 2 goal deficit.

and before people say that our defensive positioning is too poor to play like that you have to take into account the tactical demands of the system.  teams with much poorer defenders than us sit back and soak up pressure because its easier to defend when youre not being asked to sit so high and contribute to the attack as well.

If anything logically, if we have defenders with poor positioning the appropriate tactic is the one that places FEWER demands on their positioning decision making rather than the one tactic that places mroe demands.

we're actually in a no mans land where we lack the defensive quality to play the high line as well as the big clubs, but are just enough better than the weak clubs that we think that we can get away with not sitting deep on a 2-0 lead.

the reality is that a tony pulis side would have waltzed home with the 3 points if they had been fortunate enough to get a 2-0 lead.  and he would have done it with much weaker players than us

Think about it and it soon becomes clear.

Davies has lit a fire under Roses butt. Rose has been one of our best players all season, consistently putting in good performances and saving our asses on many occasions (although he is prone to the occasional slip up). I'm not sure whether it was Pochettino's doing, the competition by Davies, or just excellent attitude, but Rose has come a long way.

**Price of product:** free sample

**Where did you purchase:** MooGoo website

**Product claims:** *""We have chosen only to use non-nano zinc oxide in a cream that is designed to be a natural moisturizer. We also wanted a natural non-greasy cream that can be used on infants and adults every day. This is personally what we prefer to use at home. But making a cream this way does mean some compromise in the amount of SPF that can be achieved. SPF 15 will provide protection for 4 hours for someone who would normally burn in 15 minutes.*

*Because it is based on the Full Cream moisturiser, it is very healthy for the skin, not packed with chemicals. It is of course perfect for babies. The sunscreen actives are Ecocert approved, meaning approved for use in organic products.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. The sample was a free gift with purchase.

**Your opinion:** A very generous sample in a screw top plastic jar complete with inner lid - so getting reused! - enough for several applications to face neck and decollete. The ingredients are very gentle and heavily natural so I really wanted to like this sunscreen.

Unfortunately the product is anything but non-greasy if you apply the recommended amount. I cannot imagine it being a suitable base for make up nor wanting to reapply at the recommended frequency. However it is somewhat water resistant and would be suitable for babies.

I would be interested in trying the [MooGoo Anti-ageing Face Cream SPF15] (http://moogooskincare.co.uk/spf-15-anti-ageing-face-cream.html) to see if it is a lighter texture.

**Price of product:** £4.49 for 50ml

**Where did you purchase:** Boots

**Product claims:** *""Protects your hands in two ways and effectively reduces the appearance of existing brown spots:*

* *Protects on the outisde with SPF 25, and diffuses its Norwegian Formula concentrated moisture within the skin. Its non-greasy formula absorbs quickly, immediately, skin feels soft and supple.*

* *With patented active soy, its unique formula is clinically proven to reduce the appearance of brown spots. After 4 weeks of usage, 84% of women reported a more uniform skin tone and 81% said brown spots were visibly reduced*\*.

*Clinical study, 38 subjects, twice daily minimum application""*

**About you:** Easily tanned hands, dried out by excessive paper handling due to work.

**Your opinion:** Moisture-wise this is passable but nothing compared to their concentrated hand cream, it's probably the least moisturising of their Norwegian Formula range actually.

Doesn't leave a white cast, isn't greasy but there is a sort of sunscreeny or incompatible hand cream filmy feel and has the standard Norwegian Formula range fragrance. Though the way it's packaged means trying to get the last 30% of product out is a struggle without cutting it open which would just render the SPF useless.

Can't comment on the brown spot claims as I don't have any yet.

**Price of product:** £16.00 for 50ml

**Where did you purchase:** [Paula's Choice UK](http://www.paulaschoice.co.uk/)

**Product claims:** *Hands off, brown spots and wrinkles. I’ve got hand cream and I’m not afraid to use it. Leaves skin feeling soft, not greasy. Just the right calibration.*

* *Protects hands from the #1 cause of signs of aging*
* *Smooths and soften even the driest hands*
* *100% fragrance- and colorant-free*

**About you:** Easily tanned hands, dried out by excessive paper handling due to work.

**Your opinion:** The feeling soft and not greasy was a lie for me, it was 100% sunscreen grease feel (smell included as it's fragrance-free). Didn't do anything to alleviate my dry hands just felt worse because of the heavy sunscreen feel.

Cost is also prohibitive, it's cheaper to just use facial sunscreen on my hands.

Money. You're middle class, so you're paying for your insurance. Perhaps your job will give you insurance but it's not always great. You will go through countless companies researching the best deal. Do you want to pay 300-400 every month and have a low deductible, or 100 every month and pay 5000-6000 before insurance kicks in? 

Coverage. Once you've picked your plan, you will see access to different types of care will vary. Seeing your doctor will be simple, but perhaps mental healthcare will be a pain in the butt of referrals and finding one covered by your insurance. Do you have to get a referral first (like in the UK) or will you have more expensive insurance where you go straight to your specialist? 

Planning. Some things like having a baby require a lot more planning. Do you pay for a better plan so you don't pay thousands at the hospital (what if a C section is required?) or do you hope for the best? 

Choices. You will never be told ""ehh that's not necessary"" by a doctor anymore. Want those skin tags removed? Want a more aggressive approach to your hemorrhoids instead of cream? Go for it! (But you'll need to see if your insurance covers that)

Paperwork. Going to the Dr means filling out a lot more paperwork. 

Doctor face time. You see doctors a lot less here. You see the nurse who checks everything out, does most of your work, then a doctor pops in. Though you get charged extra for having seen a doctor. 

Umm... I think that's about it.

**Price of product:** Gift voucher (RRP $28 for 210ml)

**Where did you purchase:** Essential Day Spa (US)

**Product claims:** *""Raise Shields to Full Intensity...You are now protected by an effective light body moisturizer and sun shield all in one! Our 100% natural mineral sunscreen absorbs quickly, and is never oily or greasy. Light and comfortable to wear and always Fragrance Free, our natural formula is loaded with hydrating Hyaluronic acid, soothing green tea, skin defending vitamins and supportive essential oils.*

*Offering broad spectrum UVA/UVB sun protection utilizing pure micronized zinc oxide (250 nm average particle size). This is a gentle, physical mineral sunscreen that is skin and reef friendly. Safe for adults and children and those with sensitive skin. Titanium Dioxide Free.*

*NO NANO TECHNOLOGY! (average particle size is 240 nm) DeVita skin care products are 100 percent Vegan and Paraben Free. They are considered Gluten Sensitive Safe and never contain GMO's. DeVita products are never tested on animals (only humans!).""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because it is a very similar formulation to the DeVita [Solar Protective Face Moisturiser] (http://devitaskincare.com/store/solar-protective-moisturizer-spf-30-25-oz75ml-p-17534.html) but in a much larger pack size.

**Your opinion:** I was disappointed to learn that in 2013 DeVita changed their zinc oxide supplier and this product is [now being reviewed unfavourably.] (http://www.amazon.com/Devita-Natural-Skin-Solar-Moisturizer/dp/B000VUZ2KC/#customerReviews) I have contacted DeVita via their website but have not yet had a response. **ETA** see comment below.

This sunscreen comes in a tube which protect the antioxidants from oxidising and helps maintain hygiene. The ingredients are very gentle and heavily natural which is right up my alley. Given the pack size this is a similar price to many chemical sunscreens found on the UK high street.

The cream has a translucent quality about it and massages in easily to leave no white cast and a dewy finish. It layers up beautifully encouraging the user to use the recommended amount and reapply part way through the day. I have not experienced any irritation and absolutely would repurchase this sunscreen if DeVita resolve the issues with the quality of their current supply of zinc oxide.

**Active Ingredient:** *""Zinc oxide 19% (UVA/ UVB, micronised/ uncoated).""*

**Inactive Ingredients:** *""Aloe vera gel, water, green tea leaf extract, capric/ caprylic triglycerides, glycerin, shea butter, olive oil, lecithin phospholipid, hyaluronic acid, jojoba seed oil, olive squalane, panthenol, vitamin E, sodium PCA, rosehip oil, gotu kola, copper gluconate, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, seaweed extract, allantoin, sodium riboflavin phosphate, carrageenan, lavender essential oil, Roman chamomile flower essential oil, grapeseed extract.""*

**Price of product:** £17.00 for 100ml

**Where did you purchase:** Boots

**Product claims:** *Ultra-comfortable, easy to apply, velvety moisturising texture. Water resistant.*

*With Mexoplex, Mexoryl XL and Mexoryl SX to provide high broad spectrum sun protection available against the harmful effects of both UVA and UVB rays. Contains Thermal Spring Water.*

*Anthelios efficacy has been demonstrated via clinical studies carried out in-vivo on subjects suffering from sun intolerances, particularly those caused by UVA rays. Anthelios products all have a high PPD (Persistent Pigment Darkening) factor, offering one of the best protections against UVA offered by any brand in the world. The efficacy has been proven by a file of 16 clinical studies carried out by world-renowned expert dermatologists. The brand was also the first laboratory to use Mexoryl XL and Mexoryl SX and the first to use photostable UVA filters in its sun protection.*

**About you:** Normal fair to medium skin, no known skin conditions, tans doesn't burn.

**Your opinion:** Aside from the chemical smell it does what it claims. Goes on nicely like a moisturising body lotion, no noticeable white cast, slight shininess if not probably rubbed in with a bit of stickiness for a few minutes while it absorbs. But once applied and a few minutes have passed you wouldn't even know it was there, apart from the smell.

This can be used on the face too (eye area must be avoided) but I haven't tried that personally.

**Product claims:** *""Devita Rx Professional Skin Care Solutions Ultra Solar 50 is an exclusive natural skin moisturizer formulated to soothe and normalize all skin types. Absorbs quickly and completely. A deeply moisturizing daytime cream containing a transparent Micronized Zinc Oxide for ultimate solar protection.*

*This formulation is created specifically for those sensitive to breakouts but is an excellent choice for anyone interested in preventing the damaging effects of the sun. This moisturizer is light enough to wear under your make-up, absorbs quickly, and yet leaves the skin nourished and feeling soft and smooth. Offering full spectrum UVA/ UVB sun protection with a SPF of 50.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased to use a gift voucher.

**Your opinion:** I was disappointed to learn that in 2013 DeVita changed their zinc oxide supplier and some products are [now being reviewed unfavourably.] (http://www.amazon.com/Devita-Natural-Skin-Solar-Moisturizer/dp/B000VUZ2KC/#customerReviews) I have contacted DeVita via their website but have not yet had a response.

The version I have of this sunscreen is in a brown plastic jar which is unhygienic (especially considering the all natural preservative system), does not protect the antioxidants and just feels cheap and nasty. I have seen images of the product in a pump bottle but am not clear which is the new and which the old packaging.

On the plus side the ingredients list is short but, given the price point, I would have preferred aloe vera to have been the first ingredient (as with many DeVita products) and/ or more antioxidants.

This is a lightweight cream with a very subtle and clean fragrance, not dissimilar in texture to the Superdrug Vitamin E moisturisers. The product sinks in easily to a matte finish with no white cast and I have not experienced any irritation. It is not unpleasant to use but everything about it feels much cheaper than it is. I will not be repurchasing this sunscreen, it is just too expensive to apply and reapply every day.

**Active Ingredients:** *""Zinc oxide 19% (UVA/ UVB, micronised/ uncoated), titanium dioxide 8% (UVA-2/ UVB).""*

**Inactive Ingredients:** *""water, aloe vera gel, capric/ caprylic triglycerides, stearic acid, glycerin, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, hyaluronic acid, glyceryl stearate, vitamin E, allantoin, comfrey root extract, grapeseed extract, lecithin.""*",null,0,null,1426962430,null,0,1427144208,0,cpm7474,null,t3_2zt2x7,null,t1_cpm7474,null,t1_cpm0d1p,null,null,null,1431934758,null,3,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,3,null

I wrote a bit more about the dutch network, but I think it's more relevant to say that you're an unusually equable person, if you never find yourself stressed out when driving.

**Price of product:** $125HKD (approx. £10) for 50g

**Where did you purchase:** Skinfood in Hong Kong, /r/AsianBeauty has a list of international retailers in sidebar

**Product claims:** *""Bulgarian rose extract to relax your mind with sophisticated rose scent. With whitening &amp; UV protection functions. Brightens skin tone and remains moisturized and smooth skin.""*

**About you:** Easily tanned hands, dried out by excessive paper handling due to work.

**Your opinion:** Rose isn't a fragrance that sits well with me but a hand cream with more than a token SPF10-15 was a rather urgent requirement at the time of purchase and decided that if it did well as a hand cream I could endure it.

It didn't do well for me, in fact it had the opposite effect and dried out my hands so much those fingerprint grooves turned white from dryness.

Personally, I think the banks were irresponsible, and deserve some abuse for what they did.

But ultimately, it's down to the government to regulate and supervise the market. If there was no law against murder, there would be a lot more murders. Saying 'people should be more responsible' wouldn't have the same effect as incarcerating the murderers.

It's the same as bitching about tax evasion/avoidance. The best way to stop it? Close the loopholes and hunt those abusing the system.

No party would be stupid enough to go straight to a private insurance model, no one in the UK would vote for them as no one wants to pay for something that is currently free.

But the result of this would be the expansion of the private healthcare system and the NHS being bogged down in legalities and bureaucracy.

The end result is you will start seeing right wing activists and politicians calling for the removal of the NHS due to the cost and inefficiency.

The only reason everybody on here is nuts about Varane is because he's more known because he plays at a big club, and because Mourinho is the one who gave him his chance. I personally don't think there's much difference between them. 

However, I think Varane might be easier to get if only slightly, because Laporte has a steep release clause, think its north of 40 million quid, and Bilbao never sells for less. I don't know what Varane's release clause is, but I think it's less. Either way, we're not likely to get either. I can't see Jose spending 35 million + on a defender. 

I watch a lot of Atletico Madrid matches and I think the centre half we should be looking at because of price and his ability is Jose Maria Gimenez. He's had an unbelievable year this year, he's the same age as Zouma, and he's already a better tackler than Varane. He's still uncomfortable in possession, not nearly as good as Varane and Laporte, but that's something that can be worked on, as we've seen with Zouma. We have a good relationship with Atletico, and he would substantially be cheaper than either Laporte or Varane.

**Price of product:** 7,900Won for 50ml (approx £5)

**Where did you purchase:** [TesterKorea](http://testerkorea.com/)

**Product claims:** UV protection &amp; whitening, contains 1000mg berry complex and 200mg of vitamin C derivatives.

**About you:** Easily tanned hands, dried out by excessive paper handling due to work.

**Your opinion:** The alcohol in this cream is double edged, it makes the formula light and easy to absorb but because the fragrance is so light you can smell it easily (this may vary due to personal sensitivities). It actually smells like a citrusy alcoholic drink to me.

It's ok as a moisturising hand cream, nothing amazing and there is a very slight sticky filmy feel for me. If I can't find a hand cream with equal or higher SPF that feels better, this will most likely be my staple.

**Price of product:** £16.15 for 14.8ml

**Where did you purchase:** [FeelUnique](http://www.feelunique.com/)

**Product claims:** *Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Nourishing Lip Balm SPF20 is a daily moisturising treatment that replenishes lips with eight essential vitamins, nutrients and minerals while providing advanced broad spectrum SPF 20 sun protection against damaging UVA/UVB rays. Lips feel softer and smoother with a healthy-looking, radiant shine.*

**About you:** Compulsive lip biter/picker, frequently chapped lips from dehydration.

**Your opinion:** The small size is deceptive, this comes with a 36 month shelf life (after opening) because as a lip balm you only need a tiny bit. It's thick and hard to get out of the tube but I find it easiest to dispense onto my finger and warm it up a bit before applying to my lips.

The opaque tube also means you can be sure that the filters aren't being broken down everytime you take it out to reapply.

It does well as an occlusive protecting my lips from the environment but nothing as an actual moisturiser though.

**Ingredients:** *polybutene, microcrystalline wax, petrolatum, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter extract, nylon-12, dioctyldodecyl dodecanedioate, c12-15 alkyl benzoate, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate/octinoxte (UVB), butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane/avobenzone (UVA), glycereth-26, butyloctyl salicylate/hallbrite bhb (UV filter stabiliser), lanolin, astrocaryum murumuru seed butter, beeswax/cera alba/cire d'abeille, copernica cerifera (carnauba) wax, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, honey extract, hydrogenated castor oil, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, nasturtium officinale flower/leaf extract, retinyl palmitate, tocopherol, tocopheryl acetate, bht, iron oxides (ci 774921, ci 77492)*",null,0,null,1426967569,null,0,false,0,cpm9pi7,null,t3_2zt2x7,null,t1_cpm9pi7,null,t1_cpm0ebg,null,null,null,1431935981,null,3,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,3,null

Plenty of young families too which is a wonderful sight. It's like a normal society run by complete weirdos (which we Irish league fans are).

There'll be spare tickets going about for the Irish Cup Final. I'd encourage any casual football fan to take a trip to it. It's on the 2nd May and it'll be at Windsor Park. Tickets will probably cost £15 for adults and £7 for children, which could be up to 400% cheaper than your usual English sides - fantastic value for money imo.

I expect us to win the midfield battle of Hendo-Allen vs. Carrick-Herrera. Our lads have been in incredible form. 

What's going to be hard is slowing down Rooney and co. Rooney's been playing well, and Mata and di Maria have the potential to cause havoc. Can is going to be tested, and Skrtel and Sakho need to be on top of their game.

**Price of product:** £1.99-£2.07 for 4g

**Where did you purchase:** Boots during a 3for2 offer

**Product claims:** *Protects and relieves dry and chapped lips, while locking in moisture to help keep them healthy*

* *Instantly softens and soothes dry lips*
* *Locks in moisture to help lips recover from discomfort*
* *Protects lips from UVA and UVB rays with SPF 15*
* *Contains triple-purified Vaseline® Petroleum Jelly and Pro- Vitamin E*
* *Dermatalogically tested*

**About you:** Compulsive lip biter/picker, frequently chapped lips from dehydration.

**Your opinion:** It's vaseline in stick form, not much else to say really. The SPF is just a token advertising point, the product gets exposed whenever you take it out to apply so the minimal UV filters are already beginning to degrade once you open it.

Does the job, but wouldn't recommend for the SPF protection.

Oh right. Because its perfectly normal to pay £12m for a 17 year old or to call a 17 year old up for the fucking World Cup to replace your star injured strikers even before he's made a single appearance in the Premier League. Yeah, my mistake.

&gt; But he has done just fine as a player. In his best season before getting injured he scored 20+ goals and assistsed 15+ times.

He has had 1 good season in 9 years. He has 8 appearances this season and its almost the end of March. Last season he had a total of 13 appearances in the league. If you are that injury prone you aren't ""doing just fine"". Jackass.

&gt; This is a truly BS argument. Plenty of young players out there who are thriving because of the game time they got at a young age. In fact, it's safe to say playing at a higher competition and getting experience is a good thing. Obviously you have to look out for overplaying them.

The only BS argument here is the one you're trying to put forth with ad hominem responses without any real rebuttals except plainly just stating your opinion. Where is the proof? Oh that's right. The only thing backing up your opinion is bullshit.

&gt; But let's be honest, as a Chelsea player, RLC is hardly looking to get game time week in week out. You're hardly putting his future at risk because of injuries, or high expectations.

Go back to his appearance vs Sporting in the CL. Not even 5 minutes in and he gets caught late in a dangerous tackle. You want to talk about high expectations not affecting players? Look at Scott Sinclair, Michael Woods (dubbed the new Frank Lampard), Josh McEachran (dubbed the English Iniesta), fucking Gael Kakuta (dubbed the new Ronaldinho), Connor Clifford (also dubbed the new Lampard), Michael Mancienne (dubbed the new Rio Ferdinand).

Often enough the chatter sounds like a blindfolded man encountering an elephant for the first time. It's big, it's huge. But what is it exactly?

If descriptions come from the south they tend to be tinged with bafflement. What are those Scots playing at? What do they hope to achieve? The word employed increasingly is ""illogical"". It's the polite way of saying that the forever turbulent folk beyond Berwick have lost their wits.

A variant sustains Unionist diehards in these parts. The words they favour are ""cult"" and ""dupes"". Why has the Scottish National Party built a massive and apparently impregnable lead in opinion surveys? Because, comes the reply, its supporters are the political equivalent of the Moonies; because they are ill-educated or none too bright; because they have been lied to time and again.

It's a complicated yet crude way to explain away the collapse of three Westminster parties. It's not, at first sight, the perfect formula for a hearts-and-minds campaign. A few Tories aside, no one talked like this was when Labour was picking up 42 per cent of the Scottish vote in the 2010 election. Hysterical rancour is the language of the lost cause.

If the SNP has 46 per cent of voting intentions, according to yesterday's What Scotland Thinks/ScotCen poll of polls, the evidence says a vast shift in allegiances has taken place. Every survey since the referendum is confirmed. Nothing attempted since September by Unionist parties, and by Labour in particular, has worked. Given a uniform swing, the poll of polls says Labour will drop from 41 seats to 10, the Liberal Democrats from 11 to just one.

But who believes in uniform swings? The health warning attached to all comment says you have to bear in mind history, local circumstances, incumbency, and the effort a party is prepared to expend on a constituency. Generally, it's sound advice. It also happens to be advice shredded by Lord Ashcroft's recent polling of Scottish constituencies. The movement detected was close to uniform.

It did not, and does not, resemble an aberration. For one thing, support for the SNP is entrenched. The numbers won't shift; blandishments won't wash; arguments produced with triumphant yelps - Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (Gers) figures, the oil price, Ed Miliband's ""position"" - are brushed aside. If anything - the puzzle within the puzzle for Unionism - these seem only to harden attitudes. Forty six per cent of voters have seen and heard it all before.

A referendum No vote was supposed to end all of this. That's why the SNP's opponents are so baffled, so furious. ""You lost, get over it and move on,"" came the instruction on September 19. That was naÃ¯ve. For one thing, Better Together was meant to secure at least a 60-40 win. Its more voluble backers expected better than that. In the aftermath, they didn't stop to wonder what 44.7 per cent would do with a new sense of political engagement.

So what is going on? Let's suggest that Jim Murphy rebranding himself as the patriot's patriot - latest hashtag @JimForScotland - doesn't exactly go to the heart of the matter. The fact that the oil price is in one of its troughs has not sent SNP supporters reeling. Using Gers for another attempt to demonstrate that Scotland is too small and weak even to handle ""devo-max"" is, demonstrably, counter-productive. The refutations so appealing to those who think they know better than the herd are being tossed aside.

Treating voters as a herd explains a few things. Realisation has been growing among voters, steadily and surely, for generations. The occasional prod when an election is in sight no longer does the trick. This applies particularly, by common consent, to Labour.

It has not distinguished itself by its leadership at Holyrood. It sided with Conservatives in the referendum. Its response to deficit mania is austerity with a happy face. Its priority seems, not for the first time, to be its own survival and a Labour government at Westminster whose sole virtue is that it is not, according to the label, Tory.

The cry of ""Vote Labour and Keep the Tories Out"" did no damned good in 2010. Its 2015 equivalent - ""Vote SNP, Get Tories"" - therefore loses all meaning. The idea that ""you only get a Labour government if you vote Labour"" is as fatuous as the claim that the biggest party in the Commons forms a government. Those SNP supporters want a non-Tory administration in Westminster: there's a difference. The old binary logic no longer applies.

Westminster itself is another well-described factor. Only those trapped in that bubble by the Thames talk about disgust with the old main parties as ""anti-politics"". In their confusion, they suggest that anyone who fails to vote Labour or Tory (or even Lib Dem) has made an illegitimate choice. Recent tantrums in the London press bear this out. When arguments fail, xenophobia will do.

Reality is captured better by the fate of the LibDems. The What Scotland Thinks/ScotCen poll of polls has them on just four per cent, perilously close to margin-of-error territory, and a huge collapse from the 19 per cent recorded in 2010. Labour is far from alone in suffering a mass defection to the SNP. What's remarkable is that Nick Clegg, Alistair Carmichael and their party expected any better after their behaviour in government and their antics in the referendum.

If you believe Labour, meanwhile, Scots can vote as they please, but they will be obliged to support Mr Miliband's ""progressive policies"" if the Conservatives are ousted. Would the SNP ever dare side with the Tories? It is, first, another blundering way of saying that Scottish choices can never count for much. Secondly, it forgets the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. Above all, intentionally no doubt, it ignores how power is wielded in the Commons. Which SNP motions would Labour vote against?

This week's Survation/Daily Record survey was in line with the poll of polls, but granted the SNP still more seats - fully 53 - when a uniform swing was applied. The tabloid offered another detail, however, to suggest that the SNP phenomenon is no passing eclipse. If Labour, Tories and Lib Dems expect a hellish year in 2015, the year after will bring no relief: 50 per cent for the SNP in the constituency vote, 39 per cent on the regional list.

It suggests that voters understand their electoral system perfectly well and are prepared to exploit it to the full, first to keep the SNP in power at Holyrood, secondly to support other parties active in the Yes campaign, the Scottish Greens above all. And in the context of Scottish elections, lest we forget, Labour cannot pass off ""Vote SNP/Green Get Tories"" as any sort of argument.

The second referendum, when it comes, will have this question in common with the first: why do so many Scots want self-determination? Because, in its political behaviour, Scotland bears no resemblance to the other parts of these islands.

In a clear reference to Youri Tielemans he went to suggest that Loftus-Cheek is a far superior player than the young Belgian, just without the opportunity to play.",null,0,null,1426970371,null,0,false,0,cpmb4td,null,t3_2ztzio,null,t1_cpmb4td,null,t1_cpmb050,null,null,null,1431936652,null,7,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,7,null

null,false,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,null,"&gt; Robben missed 2.5 months at the start of the season in 04/05 / Cole missed 4 months, Dec-March through injury in 06/07

Firstly, Dec-March is 3 months not 4 months. Secondly, it was Jan- mid April, so 2.5 months, not 4 months. Thirdly, Robben didn't just miss 2.5 months during his entire time at Chelsea. He had niggling injuries during every season, especially in 06/07 where he missed 1.5 months because of a knee injury he had been carrying all season that he had to get operated on.

Also, if we're going to talk about facts lets not pretend like substitute appearances really mean anything or the FA Cup/Community Shield/Carling Cup. So for a clearer picture, I'm going to consider their stats in their respective EPL starts only:


**2004/05**

COLE - 19 starts, 8 goals, 2 assists; ROBBEN - 14 starts, 7 goals, 9 assists.

Summary: Robben contributed to 6 more goals in total in 5 less starts than Cole.

**2005/06**

COLE - 26 starts, 8 goals, 4 assists; ROBBEN - 21 starts, 6 goals, 2 assists

Summary: Cole contributed to 4 more goals in 5 more starts than Robben.

**2006/07**

COLE - 13 starts, 0 goals, 0 assists; ROBBEN - 16 starts, 2 goals 6 assists.

Summary: Robben contributed to 8 more goals in 3 more starts than Cole.

**Total:** Cole - 58 starts, 16 goals, 8 assists; Robben: 51 starts, 15 goals, 17 assists

So in 3 seasons Robben has scored pretty much the same number of goals as Cole, while creating over twice as many assists in fewer starts, while also struggling with more injuries. Also, if we were to measure the amount of 'chances created', Robben would completely eclipse Cole in that category for most seasons. Joe Cole wasn't even first choice until both Robben and Duff were injured.

&gt; Added to the fact the Joe actually gave a shit about our club.

That is irrelevant to this discussion. I like Joe Cole more than Robben as a person, but that doesn't mean I'm going to say he was the better player for us. Robben was the guy we relied heavily on driving our play. I still remember us relying completely on Robben for the first half in the FA Cup Final vs Man UTD in 2006/07. It was what everyone was waiting for. But Robben jumped for a header and rolled his ankle, came off and was sold soon after because he was injured for a large portion of that season.",null,0,null,1426970602,null,0,false,0,cpmb8xz,null,t3_2zpljy,null,t1_cpmb8xz,null,t1_cplpuni,null,null,null,1431936706,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

These public services are all funded reasonably fairly and equally through taxation. They are essential.  Yet lifeboats and guide dogs are not considered essential; they have to rely on charity donations.  We don't fund hospitals based on which tv programme happens to raise most money so why should other important services have to rely on the whim of charity. Surely the lifeboats or guide dogs are an essential service that should be funded from taxes taken from everyone equally.  

It just doesn't seem right to me that some charities are immensely wealthy because of their profile - with the associated plastic nose manufacturers, leaflet printers, 'chuggers' and TV companies all creaming off their share (""making a living off the misery of others"") while others have to struggle.  So I don't want anything to do with this system.  I think it is corrupt. I think there are people making lots of profit off these charities and that the very existence of these organisations absolve the state from dealing with the fact that essential services should be paid for by everyone equally, including large industry as Russel points out, not just the poorest of us dropping coins into a plastic bucket.

He was BBC's Sports Personality of the Year. The only other football player before him to achieve that was Wayne Rooney. There have been no other football players to get that award since. So yeah, he actually *was* considered a generational talent.

&gt; He's had more than one good season ffs. The season I focused on was just his best season

He has only had 1 season where he scored more than 10 goals.

&gt; What about Hazard, Pogba, Sanchez, Veratti, Laporte, Koke, Kongdobia, etc? PLENTY of players out there who are doing just fine.

Hazard was at Lille where the media pressure is incomparable to Chelsea. Same with Laporte, Koke, Kondogbia, Verratti and Sanchez. As for Pogba, he never got a chance at Man UTD. Ferguson opted to play Scholes over him. He left for free and signed for Juventus in a league where youth players aren't under as much pressure as in the EPL simply because there are young players being played all the time. Expectations are much lower.

&gt; Btw Sinclair had his growth stunted by moving to City, and not getting any game time. That example works in my favour actually.

Does it? Because Sinclair only started to shine once he moved to Swansea away from all the media pressure.

null,false,madeinacton,null,null,null,"I expect this will get severe down votes as it's pretty far from the conventional group think often found here but the honest answer is that nobody knows, which is why so many people are petrified of anything that resembles a private company being involved in their healthcare. 

Ironically anybody with a large amount of money will choose to use and prefer private healthcare for certain services and expect better results than using the NHS. 

The answer will likely depend on a lot of unknown variables, such as what services you are specifically referring to, who is chosen to implement them and how the government implements it and the funding it offers. 

Firstly its probably best to ignore the ludicrous comparisons you'll see here to the American system, water privatisation and many other scare stories. The second thing to bare in mind is that the NHS is huge and covers a multitude of services, some of which use private providers already successfully.

I would argue that for some areas, if implemented properly private competition could be and has been very good. Take mental health talking therapies, the private sector has lots of individuals that could charge the NHS a reasonable fee to see patients, the efficiency that could be gained from allowing the NHS to pay for you to see a home visiting locally based private therapist/psychologist could basically eliminate the current 6 month waiting lists that we have very rapidly and improve the service, offering more choice. The same could be said for many other areas, such as physiotherapy, minor operations and testing/screening services etc.

A few years back I had a mole cut from my arm and was sent to one of Labours newly outsourced small private centres which specialise in minor things like this, the whole ordeal took me around 15 minutes from walking in, to leaving and was great, a service which would be hard to match in a normal hospital.

I think areas which may struggle with privatisation are those that rely on multiple joined up offerings, such as A&amp;E and some of the core functions of our hospitals. Mainly because pricing becomes very complicated and open to abuse, overcharging and governance and accountability issues.

In many cases it is likely to be same people seeing you whether it is private or public, with the exception of people who choose to work exclusively in the private sector, so it may come down to whether or not the private sector can manage these people and the resources available in a better way, which is difficult to know and measure. It should also be noted that the public sector can struggle equally if not more in these areas, the NHS Litigation bill for 2013 was [26 billion pounds] (http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f4da10f6-a255-11e4-9630-00144feab7de.html#axzz3V3kRjnpZ). It could also be argued that the large bureaucratic and centralised nature of the service makes it very difficult to wade through the politics involved with bringing innovation into the service which holds it back from its full potential. On the other hand it's size can bring great benefits in its ability to drive down prices through economies of scale and cut out elements of bureaucracy that would be present in a competition based model.    

In summary it has the potential to bring new models of care and improve services with innovation and access to  new resources, but also carries a lot of risk of losing the benefits of a joined up service and economies of scale which it currently has. It could go either way in terms of costs and quality and it would really depend of too many factors to know what the outcomes would be. I personally think that many areas would benefit from some private provision and competition but the core services of A&amp;E and much of what hospitals can offer, should left to the public sector with some reforms.

Other than that, I understand that Martinez needs to take some pressure off Alcaraz.  Hats off to him for that.  However, I don't think it's completely fair to blame the squad when two of his defensive errors led to goals.  

As for not bringing on Stones, his quote that ""...John is a young man and sometimes we need to give him the right game to compete for his place,"" really irked me.  Why, then doesn't Barry have to compete?  Why is he guaranteed a start every time he's healthy or not suspended?

Yeah. I can't see the slightest problem with that, she'll implicitly acknowledge your rightful authority.

PS: The last time I used that was when Ms. Lackpot's sister remarried recently (she's a minister of religion of the woolly liberal folkweave-yoghurt methodist persuasion) and appointed her daughters as joint fathers of the bride, there being no actual surviving father.

My former housemate (and current great friend) moved from Tulsa to Oxford to study at St Catz college.  He met his Aussie wife (wedding's in June, here in Ox) and still lives here.  This place is a vacuum. You'll probably be here far longer than you think.  But you won't mind it.  (Same for me; I'm Welsh, but am engaged to a local lad.)

You could pick many worse places when it comes to transport.  There are frequent buses (and less frequent trains) to the airports, and they're quite cheap.  You'll be spending a lot of time on planes, returning to your family and your imaginary Aussie paramour.

As for paperwork / citizenship, I've not heard of any more difficulties than there are elsewhere in the UK.

It's also worth noting that Oxford (and the university in particular) has a relatively high number of Yanks compared to most UK cities.  I remember being invited to many screenings of the superb owl, and other things like that.  Your being American won't raise any eyebrows.

Any other questions, or if you want more specific wiffling, let me know.

I posted this yesterday. Seems relevant here

&gt;Is it just me or do juries seem to acquit drivers accused of killing cyclists on a whim?

""its not just you. Its something of a morbid running joke in cycling circles.

Theres something called ""dashboard perspective"" its the idea that a jury can and do usually empathize with the motorist because they are all themselves motorists. They all no doubt have used a phone, they have all broken the speed limit, maybe jumped a few lights in their time too - and no doubt they have also seen their fare share of cyclists using the pavements or jumping lights... Confirmation bias kicks in - they look to defend the motorist, give them the benefit of the doubt. They tend not to do the same thing for cyclists.

And when the cyclist is dead, he cant defend himself, but the motorist can. In fact the motorist can pretty much say what they want when there's no witnesses.

I wonder though how any motorist (who was in court for killing a cyclist) would feel if they jury was made up of all cyclists. I suspect there would be a national outcry as to how its unfair and unjust. But the reality is that's what happens when a cyclist is killed by a motorist. The jury are always all motorists....
I don't have an answer to that last point - its just an observation.""

This also applies to pedestrians. There are many examples of the same relaxed attitudes when pedestrians are hit and killed. Drivers and simply given the benefit of the doubt.

Teams for the most part have been playing super defensive against us, and we need players who can break down defenses in tight spaces with their dribbling ability, and Bale isn't as good at that, and it's obvious in his and Real's struggles in general against Atletico Madrid. They close down the space for Ronaldo and Bale, and Bale's impact then becomes negligible. Bale's a game-changing kind of player who can turn a game because of occasional moments of brilliance, but I'd rather not spend so much on a player who has large stretches of a game where he makes no impact.

Honestly, the only attacking player/winger I'd desperately want for our system, would be Alexis, but Arsenal would never sell him to us.

He plays the same players into he ground, even when it's obvious they need a rest.  He relies on the same starting lineup even when players are struggling for form.  And he's persisted with the same tactical approach all season, despite it not ever really paying off for us that handsomely other than a handful of good performances around the turn of the year.

The last manager to be so dogmatic and intractable?  AVB.  Look how that turned out.

I hope Poch sharpens his game and expands his repertoire for next season, otherwise honestly I can see him being yet another victim of Levy's trigger finger.",null,0,null,1426979424,null,0,false,0,cpmfky1,null,t3_2zti1o,null,t1_cpmfky1,null,t1_cpm4i4b,null,null,null,1431938818,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null
