It really disappoints me that we don't have the same Hollywoodesque zeal for our own history, which is far more colourful and interesting than most.

Even the slightly more placid Captain Phillips and the First Fleet would be interesting.

Unfortunately it seems most Empire movies were created in the 50s-80s and haven't really made much of an impact since.

I think you're exaggerating the effect of more games. Statistics show a slight decrease in winning percentage on a fixture following Europa League game, but no difference following CL, FA or league cup. This is down to rest period. And yes, Europa is our biggest commitment of the cups in terms of games but the decrease is relatively small and the increased chance of injury is mostly offset by other teams dealing with similar strain. 

People talk about sustainability like it's a foregone conclusion that we will regress but it's important to note that there are factors in our favour that might outweigh the effect of a heavy fixture list. Things like momentum and individual form. And we can definitely afford to lose a game and still make top 4, we just have to make sure not to lose the *wrong* game.

Look at the importance of Dzeko's goals. Something like 60% of the goals are away goals. Also I think 55% of his goals (a stat Opta posted not long ago), are for an equalizer or a lead. 

He doesn't take penalties either, so all his goals come from play. I guess consistency in terms of scoring important goals, Dzeko is pretty high up there. He's struggled with form here or there, but I would say any player would, given his rotation since he came to City.

Aguero is world class. But Dzeko in his shadow has been a difference maker as well. Mourinho had a quote at the end of last season with which he argued he should have won the Player of the season award over Suarez:

&gt; ""He was the third choice striker at the beginning of the season. He was hidden behind his manager's first choices and when the team needed him in crucial moments of the season, I think he made the difference.""
&gt; ""In this moment I think he has 16 goals. Sixteen goals for the third striker is something spectacular.""

In Dzeko's first 3 seasons in PL no other striker scored 14+ PL goals per season. Not Suarez, RVP or Aguero. Which when you consider his rotation is pretty mind boggling.

Both of the team have had a fair deal of flops, but they have been pretty good the last couple of years. Except some flops for City in players Jovetic, Garcia, Nastastic, Rodwell and Sinclair. While Chelsea´s flops have been Salah, Ginkel, Marko Marin, Demba Ba and Victor Moses. Other players that they have bought in have they sold for a pretty decent slump of money. 

The manager situation is mostly because Abramovic wants results straight away, he does not care about money. Doing bad in the league and not winning champions league you are getting fired. Carlo Ancelotti was doing a fantastic job for Chelsea (if you remove the last season). But let them do all these choices, waisting money. 

Will be quite interesting to see how long Mourinho will last at chelsea this time.

Is that the determining factor for our bad luck? I'm not sure, but i sincerely feel that the level of noise at the bridge could go up.

&gt;The BUF claimed 50,000 members at one point  and the *[Daily Mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail)* was an early supporter, running the headline ""Hurrah for the Blackshirts!""  The first Director of Propaganda, appointed in February 1933, was [Wilfred Risdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfred_Risdon), and he was responsible for organising all of Mosley's public meetings. Despite strong resistance from anti-fascists, including the local [Jewish community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Jews), the [Labour Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Labour_Party), the [Independent Labour Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Labour_Party) and the [Communist Party of Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Great_Britain), the BUF found a following in the [East End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_End_of_London) of [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London), where in the [London County Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_County_Council) elections of March 1937 it obtained reasonably successful results in [Bethnal Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethnal_Green), [Shoreditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoreditch) and [Limehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limehouse), polling almost 8,000 votes, although none of its candidates was elected.  However, the BUF never stood in a [General Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_elections). Having lost the funding of newspaper magnate [Lord Rothermere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Harmsworth,_1st_Viscount_Rothermere) that it previously enjoyed, at the 1935 General Election the party urged voters to abstain, calling for ""Fascism Next Time"".  There never was a ""next time"", as the [next General Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1945) was not held until July 1945, five years after the dissolution of the BUF.

It is predominantly far right, sometimes elements of the left thrown in.

That may have been where it started but it very quickly moved away from communism and socialism and become authoritarian and totalitarian.  Same with the Nazi's.

Just look at how Hitler used the German people as a socialist work force to build an authoritarian movement.

[UK Lotteries are _really_ heavily regulated](http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/Gambling-sectors/Lotteries/About-the-lottery-industry/About-lotteries-raffles/About-lotteries-raffles.aspx).

Watch out: the man will come and get you.

In particular (figures from memory): you can give at most 50% in prize fund; you can take at most 20% in administration fees, and the remainder has to go to a good cause.  Further: that good cause really needs to be registered as your ""promoter"" and licensed by the local authority for it to be legal at all.  Basically: running a for-profit lottery is not allowed; and annoyingly, even a ""all goes back to the prize fund"" lottery isn't allowed either.

From the gambling commissions web site:

&gt; Lotteries (also known as raffles) cannot be run for private or commercial gain. 

It's awful, because the National Lottery gets a whole bunch of exceptions; and the laws seem heavily weighted to protect the National Lottery's monopoly.  As with most laws though: whether they are fair or not isn't your problem.

Finally; if you're running a lottery over the Internet, then

&gt; Lotteries can be run by means of remote communication including the internet, telephone etc. Large remote society lotteries and remote local authority lotteries require a remote lottery operating licence issued by the Gambling Commission. 

You might get around all of this by using Bitcoin's trans-national nature and setting yourself up in the Cayman isles or something.  But then you lose a lot of the ""we're a known quantity"" PR value.

Good luck anyway.  I don't envy you.

Those lettings always have a paper trail and rogue landlords tend not to use any established letting agents for obvious reasons.  

Buy-to-let landlords are not the same as rogue landlords, although there is obviously an over-lap. You're talking about something completely different.

We're talking about dodgy landlords renting out a 2 bed house to 3 Polish families or renting out 6 rooms of his 3 bedroom house to non-EU immigrants who may or may not be legally allowed to even reside here.. People living in kitchens, garages, etc.

No letting agents, all rent is taken in cash. No repair work, the tenants likely have no real way of even contacting the landlord to ask him to make repairs. The tenants have no legal protections whatsoever, no tenancy agreements, nothing. 

Many of the rogue landlords don't even own the properties that they  let out, they take out a lease for the property and sub-let it. 

HMRC can't do anything about these cases unless multiple departments actually communicate, as well as the police. When there's no paper trail whatsoever it requires real, investigative work, which means visiting the property, establishing who the tenants are paying rent to, finding out who the landlord actually is and where he lives, etc. It's not as simple as ringing the letting agents up or checking the land registry to find the owner, it requires actual investigative work, which certainly isn't covered by £3 million in funding..

As I said, the tax evasion aspect is just 1 part of the issue. The other large issue is the fact that rogue landlords are exploiting people and have no regard for the law, they need to be physically shut down, not just billed for unpaid tax. It's not just up to HMRC to tackle the issue, which is why the government needs to actually work together to sort the problem out.

I then applied for another position which was paid, and got it. If some companies are willing to pay apprentices full wages, they should all be paid full wages. The only difference between me and the other staff is that I wasn't allowed into the toilets with the kids. That was it. I did the exact same work, same planning, same hours.

In response we should be slashing their budget and forcing them to go back to basics, not giving them more money and powers. It's clearly an issue of incompetence, not funding or powers. They have too many toys to play with, we should be taking some of them away. 

I have to admit I'm not sure why we're still allowing people to fly to Turkey unattended if they aren't adults. It's well known that Turkey is letting in ISIS recruits by the bucket-load... But who are we to question the competency of the UK government, we need to just allow them to pass additional laws instead which, as always, will solve the problem.

With their support you could take the actions you need to take to help improve their kids' grades. Which leads us to...

3) when the parents won't support you, you're going to need support from your management team, and if they don't support you then it's game over.

You said ""nationalism isolates"" which frankly I disagree with, although you'd be right in saying socialism and nationalism do not really work in conjunction with each other.

Nationalism is the collective thought and contribution to a common nation. The greatest example, in my opinion, being that of the French revolution. The revolution is in part to blame by the rise of nationalism in 18th and 19th century Europe, something many will argue is the reason America is the level of 'patriotism' it is today.

Before this revolution, people identified themselves as persons from regional levels, whereas after the revolution, people identified themselves as French. 

A further look at nationalism as a 'societal collectivism' can be seen in the occurrence of many wars preceding the World Wars, but after the revolution. Many people went on to fight in these wars as they saw it as a 'national duty' to their 'great' nations.

null,false,HolySheesh,null,null,null,"I think I can help you out here. I would describe myself as 'posh' and when I moved to my local state 6th form they would mercilessly tease me about being posh. That being said I'm not aristocratic posh like your family, but it's near the same thing.

In regards to what you should wear I would recommend generally being always smart casual. No tracksuits or anything like that, tee shirts are probably a no. But your family may be different and you'll just have to see. I recommend for your first couple of days you just go about wearing a smart pair of well fitted chinos and something like an Oxford shirt. Tuck the shirt in, wear a nice leather belt and have a pair of decent real or fake leather shoes to go with. Get to see what the standard is around where you live and adapt if necessary. 

 Knives and fork etiquette and how they are laid out is a thing, but you will again have to see with your family. Often it may only be done that way if it's a formal dinner, you'd be surprised with the amount of posh people who don't eat fancy food for their everyday dinner. Maybe on standard days it'll just be an affair of sitting around a table and eating with normal cutlery. 

Some like to be known by their professional titles, others don't. If your mother prefers to be known by Dr X then refer to her by that. I would recommend though whenever speaking to anybody who isn't part of the family, refer to her as Lady Diane X and if they know her well then refer to her as Dr X. I know a lot of people who prefer their title but many things it's a bit silly and like their normal name or their professional name. 

In regards to your last point, I think really you'll just have to get experience and adapt to the situation. Over time you'll notice the smaller aspects you might have to work on. The only thing I can recommend immediately is making sure your enunciation of words is good and that you keep slang to a minimum/not at all (i.e.  use 'the Queens English').

That's all I can think of. I apologies if this advice is actually a load of crap but it's what I can recommend having lived a 'posh' life and being around plenty of other poshos. Often it really depends on the family and the individuals when it comes to etiquette. I know people who are infinitely more wealthy than me and just want to be referred to by their first name and be casual around, and I know people who are less wealthy than me and demand that they get treated like they're the bloody Duke of Westminster.

null,false,ohanewone,eng-Cambridgeshire,Near Herts,null,"As someone who works in a school, but is not a teacher, I would absolutely not ever become a teacher.

As a kid in High School I always wanted to be one, but never really did anything about it when I went to College, and instead just started doing IT work.

I always imagined that Teachers had a pretty nice time of things, especially here in England where you get a week off every 6 or so, plus 2 weeks at Christmas and Easter, and 6 over the summer - think it works out to about 37 weeks of work a year (I have that, plus 4 weeks of non-term time that I owe - this is generally made up by Christmas).

I always imagined the hardest part of being a teacher to be the lesson planning, and marking 30 or so papers a night (heh, that's only one class!).

For most of the teachers I work with, they'll have at least 3 lessons in a day (figure 75 students minimum), of which all 3 have to be lesson planned, and all three are likely to have some level of work to mark, they regularly have 4 or 5 lesson days though, which just adds to this.

They also have duties, so at break and lunch they are patrolling halls, standing in key places, or running detentions - most will use half the lunch period to do a duty, with the other half being there to scarf some food quickly (about 25 minutes) - core subject teachers, and certainly core subject dept. heads, will usually end up having a revision/catch up session during lunch, and will eat their lunch at their desk, while students do work.

So, that alone is enough to keep you more than busy, your lesson planning/marking will end up being done at home, during your time, and that's the base of being a teacher.

But that's not all.

Performance Management changing to be results driven (instead of automatically moving up the chain) means all of these teachers, and certainly dept. heads, now need to be data analysts as well (which is my job actually) - they need to know how many of their students are going to make expected/better than expected progress, by all the special groups (SEND, PP, High/Middle/Low attainers, ethnic groups), as well as identify, and document, what they are doing with the students that aren't making their expected progress. This is even more work that cannot be done while at school, so it ends up being done at home.

A typical day for a married couple I work with, which would probably be on the extreme end of things, as both are dept heads, and one is in charge of our SEND kids:

Wake at 5.30
Finish marking that wasn't completed last night
Wake children, get them ready for their school day
While one is showering, the other finishes their marking, they then swap
Leave the house about 7.30, drop their kids off at breakfast club
Husband has a catch-up/strengthening/revision morning session, which starts at 8/8.30 (depends on if he has a meeting scheduled first thing)
Teach all day
Revision session/catchup after school
Leave at 4/4.30, go collect kids from after-school club
Feed kids dinner, have a bit of time with them till bed (7/7.30)
Make own dinner
Lesson Plan/Mark with T.V. on, till bedtime (approx 11.30)
Continue to mark in bed till 12.30/1.00

This half-term, the husband was in 3 days - 2 to continue to work with borderline students, and those that are behind, 1 to get caught up on all his data work (this was a day he was emailing me a lot) - the last time they actually took more than a single day off during a half-term was in October, where they went to Centreparc for the last weekend of the half-term, and still did work while there at night - and they certainly do not get paid overtime for any of the stuff they do outside of the school day

There were even non ethnic minorities on the exec for lots of the ethnic societies at points while I was there.

BREAKING NEWS: PROTEST AT SOTHEBY'S TOMORROW, SUNDAY 22ND FEBRUARY IS CANCELLED. WE HAVE WON!!!!!

We have officially resolved our collective dispute with CCML, the cleaning contractor at Sotheby's and there will be no protest tomorrow.

We have won every single demand we made. This is an inspiring victory and a true David v Goliath triumph! On the eve of our protest and the serving of notice to ballot for industrial action, Sotheby's instructed CCML to bring an end to this dispute to make sure we didn't go ahead with the protest tomorrow. In other words, they were told to eat humble pie.

This is what we have won: 

1. The London Living Wage (LLW) of £9.15 per hour

2. The backdating of the LLW to 1st November 2014 when the current rate of £9.15 p/hour was first introduced.

3. A change in the chemicals the cleaners use (which previously caused them chest pains and rashes) to eco-friendly and completely natural products. 

4. The provision of proper “dust masks” to wear when cleaning

5. The reinstatement of our shop steward who was recently suspended for his trade union activities. 

6. The reinstatement of our trade union member who was dismissed 4 months ago. He will also receive backdated pay. 

7. The return of all the hours which were cut from the cleaners and porters over 6 months ago. Their pay will also be backdated. 

8. A rota will be introduced now to ensure that all the cleaners and porters can work at Sotheby's events at which they are paid an enhanced rate. 

9. They will now be able to take all their annual leave in one go. Previously they were forbidden from doing so which meant they were unable to visit their families in Latin America due to time and cost constraints. 

10. All wages which were unlawfully deducted will be returned. 

11. Management will write a formal written apology to all the cleaners and porters for the way they have been treated. 

12. Before the 6th March 2015 Sotheby's will make us an offer of proper contractual sick pay, a full framework for which will be put in place once agreed.

Thank you so much for all your support! We couldn't have done it without you and if any of the points we have agreed are reneged upon we will immediately call for another protest and ballot our members for industrial action which we hope you will support us in.",null,0,null,1424606542,null,0,false,0,cotcutt,null,t3_2wqln5,null,t1_cotcutt,null,t3_2wqln5,null,null,null,1424728399,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

Your point basically rests on JSA being fair because the people claiming it will have already paid in or will be paying into it at a later date.

What people really have a problem with are the people who will take without ever paying in.

Since Lazar won't be playing in Europe I put him next to Sterling, Ibe seems to be in good form so it would be a shame to put him on the bench honestly. Coutinho hasn't looked himself lately so I think it's better to have him as a potential sub to come in if we need more creativity.

Allen has been impeccable the last couple of games so him starting would be great, whilst Can has looked a bit shaky the last couple of games. Perhaps Emre can come on later if Allen is being outmuscled by Soton's midfield. I also put Lovren in since I think he'll be motivated and ready now against his old club. 

On the bench we still have Lallana, Couts, Balo, Can and Lambert to sub in.

null,false,Arthur-Guinness,,Back of the pub,null,"OK - depending on *when* you travel, and where in Belfast you work - 45 min to an hour could get you as far as an arc going from Comber-Saintfield - Ballynahinch - Dromara - Banbridge - Donaghcloney - Waringstown - Moira (bad traffic) - Anywhere from Ballinderry to Antrim - Kells - Ballyclare - Carrick - Bangor.

For that budget you'll be priced out of the ""posh"" towns like Hillsborough or Helens Bay for sure.   It also means in Belfast - you're unlikely to find something 4br+ and detached for 180K in an area that isn't at least a bit dodgy.  I am also going to presume as a foreigner that you would like somewhere that doesn't have permanent sectarian features like flegs, sectarian lamppost&amp;kerb paint and murals.   

You are probably going to want to look at the ""bedroom communities"" that are far enough out you can get more for your money and I'm going to assume you want 4 bedrooms.

OK with that said, there are some decent places to try, nowhere is perfect and there are going to be some sectarian things everywhere  but here are my suggestions in that arc (the ones on the side of wherever your work location is will make more sense): 

- Comber
- Killinchy (Killyleagh is nice but too far)
- Carryduff
- Saintfield
- outskirts of Hillsborough (ie. Annahilt etc.)
- Banbridge
- Moira
- Upper Ballinderry
- Templepatrick
- Off the M2, there are some OK places (the newer the development the better), but alot of bad as well.
- If you need to be off the A2, you might get somewhere OK around Holywood, but you don't want to go too far either.

Of the main roads the consensus in the office is that while all main routes in/out of Belfast are bad in the AM/PM, the most reasonable is the M1, but this is only relative and if you can have flexible start times at work (particularly if you can get an early start) this will really improve your commute times.   If you leave Boucher Road and head up the M1 outside of commute times, you can get all the way to Newry in 45 minutes or if you're leaving from North Belfast you'd get over halfway to Londonderry - but at 5PM it could take you double that on either road.

Lastly, I'll just list a few places I don't like because any post on this sub should offend someone:

- Bangor
- Newtownards
- Moneyreagh
- Ballynahinch (sorry, not sorry)
- Dromara
- Waringsford
- Dromore
- Any of the Belfast ""suburbs"" Lisburn/Dunmurry/Castlereagh/Dundonald/Newtownards
- Lurgan/Craigavon/Portadown
- Antrim
- anywhere on the A8/A57 Ballyclare, Ballynure, Larne - all holes.
- Carrick
- Newtonabbey


Other points:

The further out you go, the more you'll get for your money.
There are many many nice and reasonably priced houses in the countryside... so if you don't mind living outside of a town like Ballynahinch, you'll still find some great places for sale nearby.

The other thing you'll want to think about if you have or are thinking of having kids is schools.   Do look into the quality of the local schools before you buy as it is kind of variable and if you pick a smaller place, you'll likely end up with an additional school run.

Likewise, are people of African ethnicity ""black"" because some southern racists in the US have chosen to lump them all into a separate class of people based on the color of their skin? Someone from Nigeria looks nothing at all like someone from Côte d'Ivoire.

I think this is a self-perpetuating cycle because as we fight the theory of race, we buy into its verbiage. We start using terms like black and white and start thinking of ourselves as such, when there is absolutely zero biological basis for it.

In short, only racists believe in races. We need to stop legitimizing it by pandering to it.

- The Doctor is an alien who travels through time and space, often running into trouble and confronting threats to humans and other beings.

- His means of travel is a craft called the TARDIS, which is bigger on the inside and is permanently ""disguised"" as a 1960s police box.

- He travels with one or more companions, usually attractive women, who act as the audience's proxy and occasionally the Doctor's conscience (and more often in the past, damsels in distress).

- When mortally wounded, he regenerates with a new appearance and a personality adjustment.  This is done to accommodate the lead actor leaving and being replaced (which happens every three years on average).

- There are no strict rules of time travel like there are with other franchises.  Sometimes there are causal loops, sometimes not.  Some events can be changed; some cannot.  The rules tend to bend from episode to episode, and shouldn't be scrutinized too intensely.

- There's a certain amount of doofiness that probably wouldn't be excused with newer, slicker sci-fi franchises, as DW has a lower budget than most other popular sci-fi and originated more or less as a kids' show fifty-one years ago.

This season Dzeko was underwhelming when he played the targetman behind an other striker (4-2-3-1 ish).

So, Aguero's early form playing up-top and ""destroying"" oppositions' back line really had the greater impact on Dzeko's performances as he had to be the one to drop back, where he seems to often isolate the other striker, slowing down plays and dumping the ball wide.

I'd love to see what you guys think of the Dzeko-Aguero partnership, and especially if you also have the same impression as me which is that the duo's chemistry is better with Dzeko up-top laying off the ball for Aguero coming in, rather than Aguero up-top and Dzeko dropping back as a targetman (with Dzeko underperforming in this case).",null,0,null,1424608876,null,0,1424688316,0,cotdbqf,null,t3_2wop3q,null,t1_cotdbqf,null,t1_cosqyvb,null,null,null,1424728735,null,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2,null

null,false,lovechip,null,null,null,"Hi! This is a great question. I'm someone from a very working class background and won a scholarship to a private school and consequently learned, VERY quickly how to fit in with 'posh' people without sacrificing personality. 

The first thing is, I found that a lot of the aristocracy have a lot more in common with the working classes than they do with the middle or upper middle classes. Aristocracy can be really unguarded, speak their mind, swear, get drunk and be pretty uncouth because wealth and status like that puts them beyond the rules, in a similar way to being extremely working class puts you outside of 'society' as well. It's the middle classes who are much more rule and ettiquette obsessed because they're aspiring to a higher wealth and status. People at opposite ends of the spectrum generally don't give so much of a shit.

That being said, Oxfordshire, where I live, is actually really conservative politically, so where they may be relaxed sorts of people, they're likely to have some pretty dismissive opinions towards poorer people, like fox hunting, hate europe. It's a stereotype, but Oxfordshire is very conservative. On the other hand, some more maverick types in the aristocracy may be extremely liberal and left wing. So, if you get into any discussion around politics, if you're talking with very loud, ra ra, types, it's possible that you just won't be listened to. Try not to let it bother you. There's very little hope of changing someone's mind on anything like that. 

I found at school that everyone was very nice and I made friends really, really easily, but that's because I didn't have a chip on my shoulder and was generally a very polite person. There were a couple of other girls who had scholarships who really stuck out like a sore thumb. They were sort of chavvy and a bit rough (whichm oh god I don't even want to say that, it's more how others would have perceived them and I just saw it through their eyes. They were really lovely girls and still had really good friends, so it didn't make any difference in the long run). They both had regional accents, which I did for about a week, then it disappeared through no conscious effort of my own. One girl chewed on her jumper sleeve and looked pretty unkempt, whereas a lot of 'posh' types are really well groomed and have this constantly 'clean' look about them even if they haven't made any effort. I have no idea why. 

Basically, over 7 years I was there, I realised there was as much diversity amongst them as there is everyone else. Being yourself will, over time attract the people who are like you aside from class or background so don't try to be something you're not. Saying that, I know this could be a daunting situation so you just want to make a good impression. I would therefore suggest being well groomed. If you're doing any particular events or going places, ASK them what sort of things they'll wear or if there's a dress code... don't be afraid of not knowing. Dinner table manners are another thing. Take your lead from other people and watch what they're doing. Look up which cutlery is used for what. Use a napkin if it's available and put it across your lap. Don't start eating until everyone's food arrives. If you make yourself aware of dining ettiquette ahead of time you'll at least be aware of what might be expected. Then just watch. Shake hands with people confidently and firmly when you meet for the first time. This sort of politeness will just make you come across as neat and polite and even if you need to ask or don't know about the finer details, if there are any, at least you'll have made a good first impression. 

Polite stuff to say are pleases, thank yous, 'may I.....' instead of 'can I....'. 'Lovely to meet you'. 

HAHA sorry, this has ended up being really waffly! You'll be absolutely fine. Maybe a bit nervous at first, but it'll go quickly once you've had a chance to observe how things are done there.

&gt;Let’s set aside the issue of whether these policies are needed or would work. What interested me about them was that, unlike the badger cull, they weren’t advocated in terms of regrettable necessity. There was no sense that threatening people who are poor, young, ill, fat, addicted or all of those things was something ministers would rather not have to do. It wasn’t a case of “needs must” – because if needs really must, they’d surely have musted when Cameron first came to power, rather than just in the run-up to an election.

&gt;By using phrases like “sick-note culture” and “it isn’t something for nothing”, these proposals are deliberately made divisive and accusatory. The country is in an irritable and confused state – most people are poorer and more worried than they were. In our less admirable moments we all look for people to blame. We know whom Ukip would blame.

So, some people take that advice and go and do just that. For example in 1996 Kenya King set up the MOBO Awards which would then first be held in 1998. Almost immediately it's branded as divisive and racist, ignoring the fact that the *very* first MOBO awarded was to Tim Westwood, a white man.

&gt;I think if you start adding in the value of previous jackpots through rollovers, it's not really mathematically fair to ignore the previous lotteries in your calculation of EV.

That's the thing, if we make the EV non-negative, the current price of the ticket should be ~0.00186 and we won't be able to do rollovers (jackpot will stay at 1.51547589 forever). Whenever the players are less fortunate (when 816 tickets are purchased and no-one wins), we'll put the excess funds aside that will be used to compensate the draws when less than 816 tickets are sold before the jackpot is won. There will obviously be a slight variance to it, but it should average out in the long-term. That would technically make us the lotto with the best odds in the world.

The question then becomes: is it worth ""fixing"" the jackpot for the sake of having 0 EV tickets, or players care less about the EV and more about the size of the jackpot?",null,0,null,1424609920,null,0,1424610360,0,cotdjsk,null,t3_2wnkwp,null,t1_cotdjsk,null,t1_cotdc8a,null,null,null,1424728888,null,1,false,BitcoinUK,t5_2wq3q,1,null

My first year of driving, I think I paid £1400, and that was with my dad as the main driver.

You could always look into reducing the cover from fully comprehensive down to 3rd party, fire and theft; that usually brings down the cost quite alot...but you have to bear in mind that the cover is reduced too. How much is the van worth? If it's a relatively low cost van, think about 3rd party.

Only other option would be to consider monthly payments for it to help spread the cost. Unfortunately insurance companies tend to whack on a load of interest but it may be an option.

Hope this helps.

Also to provide proper and appropriate security, Eg, student ID cards, night guards in students residence, and bouncers and door men at student night clubs.

&gt;Sorry, no can do. You should not have the expectation that your ideas will be respected or even debated 'in a respectful manner'. Instead, you should expect to have your most cherished beliefs openly ridiculed and mercilessly criticized. 

Ok separating the idea from the person is what a respectful and meaning full and productive debate should be. You can be fucking brutal in your arguments but you should make it personal, you should allow both (or more) points of view fair chance to explain their position, ask question of the other side, and answer any questions put to them, generally with a moderator/chair to keep control. BBC 4 does this well, and does Question time (not always but most of them time)

A bad debate is just shouting at the person, attack them personally, talking over each other, not answering the others question, not allowing the other side to be represented. Most American news media takes this approach, see any bill orleay, any fox news and friends.

I accept the fact that some people are not interested in working and although I concede that they add unnecessary pressure on the system, if the only way to achieve 'perfect justice' is to collectively punish every unemployed person, then its not something I think we should do. In the same way that we don't just lock every single person up to ensure nobody ever commits a crime, we shouldn't operate on the assumption that every JSA claimant is just trying to freeload.

The insurance analogy is not flimsy, it accurately describes what our government is doing. The only real inaccuracy is that not everybody owns or wants a car - so naturally not everyone is paying into the system or can get anything out of it.

In terms of who should supply the JSA, I don't believe we should leave it up to private insurance. When you buy car insurance, you accept that a large part of the risk is in your own behaviour. You can write off your car purely out of your own carelessness. When it comes to your job, most people don't have that same control. It is fundamentally unfair to expect people to have insurance against something so intrinsic to modern life as their job when they have so little control over it. We should also recognise that the vast majority of people don't have control over their employment status and therefore should not be punished for losing their jobs. Theyve already paid into the system, or will when they can.

I'm not intending to attack you, I just find it fascinating that the way we think and talk about this issue has been warped. People don't have much control over their employment status - this is a fundamental truth that virtually everyone understands, yet when it comes to the unemployed actually claiming JSA, suddenly they're expected to have both planned for becoming unemployed, should take any job that comes along, and should also be forced to work for a pittance without any of the rights afforded to 'normal' employees. What the hell are we doing to each other?

To actually answer your question, I am opposed to any kind of relationship between the amount a person has paid in and the amount they get out of it. I don't believe that this will lead to fairness - it will lead to the people with the best, highest paying jobs having a distinct advantage over those with poorer paying jobs.

Well it's interesting - because look at what happens when subreddits are created to be safe-places.  They often end up far more intolerant of differing points of view than reddit central.  Try posting a contrarian opinion to /r/shitredditsays for example and see how many nanoseconds it takes before you're banned.

Many politicians, news pundits, celebrities and experts need them for talking to each other on TV and radio.

Which is why for today's game I would prefer to see a Balotelli - Sturridge penetration, because the way Southampton compress means that opponents have little shots on target against them (infact, Southampton have conceded the least amount of shots in the Premier League thus far). If we play a 3-4-2-1, I feel that we will contain Southampton and dominate but with nothing to show for it. So the question for Rodgers is: Do I start Balotelli or sub him on 60 mins or so?

I think you're right on the point of us having more rigid positions this season, and it's paying dividends on the defensive front. But I think the fact we now have a CDM protecting a back three who are all actually defenders (unlike gerrard) is the main reason. People like to talk about the CDM sweeping across the entire width of the field to stop attacks, but that's a bit general to be honest. The understanding between our back three and the CDM is what is helping us protect clean sheets. Skrtel is allowed to essentially function as a sweeper on occasion, which is perfect considering his incredible and underrated reading of the game.

Another thing worth noting is that our LCB and RCB are allowed to move in to the full-back roles when Migs has the ball, giving us much more width than the formation would have you assume. When this happens, our CDM drops, as does Skrtel at CB to offer options should the wings not be viable options for a pass. It's a weird mix of fluidity and rigidity. The positions themselves are fixed, but the formation is allowed to move if it's as a unit. 

Last point, I worry for us if we remove a CAM for a ST. Defenders really struggle to cope with our formation when two CAMs are in there, because a ton of space is created for at least one of them to run on or pick a pass. Obviously, we're struggling to score goals and that's an issue, but adding another ST in there might restrict space for the lone CAM and lead to a drop in chances created. It's a tough choice because you risk creating less and possibly scoring more, but with two CAMs you'll generally create more but, as we've found out, score less. 

I'm quite obsessed with Rodgers' tactical choices, because he's so precise with how he wants each player/position to play the match. Crappy TV punditry has made a lot of people think tactics are as simple as a rigid 4-4-2 where each player either defends, attacks or does a bit of both. It's far more complicated than that and I can't think of anything more fun than observing a manager's instructions work wonders on the pitch.

On your point about the lone CAM, it also works since the CAM that we deploy, whether it be Coutinho, Lallana or even Sterling has more runners ahead of him (Balotelli and Sturridge) than just one. So it encourages him as there are more people ahead of him rather than to his side where it is easier to pass to. When we have 2 upfront with a lone CAM behind him, we're far more threatening. I'm not sure I agree with 'creating less and possibly scoring more'. In fact, with both Coutinho and Lallana on the pitch, we've created less as opposed to say Coutinho with Balotelli - Sturridge.

Why? Clean workshop, surfaces, etc is essential, especially when working on the head and engine internals.

&gt;but it's not going to be if it's a road bike.

Massive generalisation.  Age of the bike and amount the previous owner looked after and cleaned it is a huge factor, as is how it was stored (outside on a farm vs air conditioned garage) and it's use. We don't know.

&gt;BTW, it's easier to get the engine out without the top end in my experience.

I don't disagree, but that wasn't the point I was making. It's harder to both get the engine out and keep the internals undamaged and clean with the head already off.

That's absolutely a Sam problem, and he's going to have to get over it.  We're vulnerable to counter attacks **the entire time**.  If we're dominating the pitch the way we were before we shifted to a defensive mode, there's zero reason to change things up.  Keep the pressure on Lloris, not Adrian.

The first goal was a result of us shifting to a defensive mindset.  I hate to bring American football into this but Vince Lombardi had a number of good points -- here I'm chiefly thinking of ""The best defense is a good offense.""  If you keep the opponent on their heels the entire time, they can't rally.  Sam ever makes his peace with that, we'll be unstoppable.

That's what it should be, but the term ""safe space"" has been promoted by people following a social justice agenda to mean something quite different from *physical* safety.

It's basically a way to make people feel comfortable by excluding ""oppressive"" or ""threatening"" ideas and viewpoints.

This makes sense in some situations (eg, you don't want skeevy sexually aggressive types in a rape victims' support group), but the basic idea has been co-opted and mutilated to the point any member of any ""disadvantaged"" group can claim they feel ""threatened"" or ""unsafe"" as a result of anything, even polite disagreement or inconvenient questions (or, as here, the presence of white people at ""their"" ~~drinking fountain~~ event).

It's all tied in with ""microaggressions"" and other silly ideas that try to conflate even legitimate differences of opinion with physical violence (either actual, or the implicit threat thereof).

Basically give people an excuse to feel morally superior to and manipulate, exclude or control others - *even for what seems like a good reason at the time* - and it quickly corrupts the people trying to protect the newly-advantaged group until they begin re-enacting in miniature much of the same behaviour that they're criticising when people did it to the group they're trying to protect.",null,0,null,1424615248,null,0,1424615536,0,coteymh,null,t3_2wr1vh,null,t1_coteymh,null,t1_cotdjzg,null,null,null,1424729546,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

Edit: [Link to a review of the dragons failures](http://www.dragonsdeninvestors.com/dragons-den-failures.php)

&gt; Dragons’ Den failures need not always be failures. One can very well turn the wheels of luck to one’s favour with grit and determination. Rob Law is the classic example of one of the Dragons’ Den failures turned into successes. Rob law was humiliated by Dragon Theo Paphitis when he pulled out one of the straps from his luggage bag for kids, Trunki that helps kids to carry books, toys, clothes etc while travelling. He was stamped as one of the Dragons’ Den failures and sent on his way back home. Not one to be put off easily, Rob re-designed his bag, correcting the flaws and has hence sold 120,000 bags globally. Toast a Cup-A-Wine Over This Success

&gt;Dragons’ Den failures don’t see it as the end of the world! James Nash surely belongs to this genre. He dreamt, and dreamt big! Nash’s pitch for a plastic glass filled with French wine and a tear off lid actually proved very convenient for a compulsive wine drinker out on the road without a corkscrew of a glass to supplement his drinking spree. But some beg to differ!

&gt; Nash’s pitch for £ 250,000 for a 25% stake in his company, wine innovations ltd. did not prove convincing to the investors after harsh grilling. Duncan Bannatyne dismissed it saying that people don’t want wine in glasses with seals on top. Another one of Dragons’ Den failures? Of course, he would have been if Marks and Spencer hadn’t come to his rescue by placing orders for 187 ml glasses of Chardonnay, Le Froglet Rose or Shiraz. Nash is now struggling to keep up with the huge demand for Dragons’ Den failures product, a Cup-a-wine!",null,0,null,1424615276,null,0,1424617187,0,coteyyt,null,t3_2wr4fa,null,t1_coteyyt,null,t3_2wr4fa,null,null,null,1424729550,null,44,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,44,null

Water is a tiny part of the healthy living guidelines and does not hydrate the body alone, we need a raft of nutrients to help the body hold onto water. We do not need to drink that much if we eat plenty of low sugar fruits and non starchy vegetables (most countries advocate seven to nine a day). Other nutrients important in anti ageing and skin hydration include various minerals (seeds, beans, lentils), essential fats and vitamin D (oily fish up to four servings a week, whole eggs, seeds again).

If we force JSA claimants to work in order to get their JSA, then they should be paid a living wage and have the same rights and protections as a regular employee, which is otherwise known as a 'job', in which case this wouldn't even be a problem since nobody would be unemployed.

What we are actually setting up is a system whereby companies can race to the bottom with wages and then get free labour at the expense of the taxpayer, and if the people providing that free labour refuse, or do it badly or whatever, then we sanction those people and take away the pittance they would have gotten.

The logical conclusion to this ridiculous system is that we will see people starving because they turned up late for their terribly paid, forced place of employment one too many times. We should not be treating each other like this, even if a tiny minority are taking advantage of good faith. 

Perfect justice does not exist. The universe doesn't care about us and bad things happen. We shouldn't treat the most vulnerable in our society as though they're all freeloading wasters with nothing to contribute who should be eternally grateful that they get a pittance for doing a job they have no interest in. This is not what progress looks like.

Mark my words, the problems we'll have after mass sanctions due to these new schemes will be far, far more costly than just accepting that a tiny minority will game the system.

Israel has categorically *not* called for a two-state solution - not how you imply it; and Palestinians have done likewise, anyway.
They call for a peace - while building illegal settlements on Palestinian land.
It's like someone saying 'let's stop fighting' - while still punching you in the face.

The fact that you look to justify the collective punishment of a civilian population for the behaviour of a political party, shows either ignorance, or a callousness, that has nothing to do with realistic discussions of international relations, or norms of human decency.

Hamas was ready to negotiate, with the EU, and US, willing to do so - so Netanyahu, fearing this 'peace offensive' - cooked up a pretext for the most recent massacre.

Noble needed to come off. He was a sneeze away from a second yellow and that man can not refuse a tackle. Lamela and Eriksen would have targeted him and he would have been off within 10 minutes. The issue is not the sub, but that there's not better players on the bench to come on.

When Cole did come on we went from a 433/451 to a 442. I wouldn't have done that, but if Nolan had come on instead then there would have been just as many complaints. And we don't know if Nolan is injured or something like that. I find it surprising he didn't play. Also, the Jarvis sub was made so that it was a proper 442 with no strikers on the wing. ANd i believe they scored after that. 

And on to Spurs scoring. Neither goal was really due to poor play. 

The first was a lucky, almost freak, goal that would have gone high and wide of into the ground 99 times out of 100. This time it went in and while it looked awkward I don't really blame anyone. It happened and...well that shit happens. 

the second? obvious dive imo. Kane threw his legs out as soon as he felt song's presence. 

Really, i don't have too many complaints about Sam and I think most of the frustration will be down to feelings from previous games, not really about today in particular. I think 451 is a better formation for away (opposed to 442 diamond) as it allows for a more narrow defensive line. We did a good job ushering Kane, Lamela and Eriksen for most of the game. most of their shots game from Eriksen or Mason taking 25+ yarders and none after the 10th minute were really that good. And the reason they had so many poor long range shots is because we were closing them down quickly and those were the best changes to shoot Spurs had. 

Overall we just need some more depth. Sam isn't trying to piss people off so i assume that he brought the best squad we have. It's unfortunate but if it wasn't for a unlucky Rose goal and a dive we would have been walking away with 3 well deserved points.

You've came to the right place, as a fellow Yank, I'll tell you a bit about Everton. First, Everton is located in Liverpool and is also known by their nickname The Toffees. They've been historically one of the best teams over the past 100+ years, but in the last 20 we've been middle of the pack and rising to upper middle of the pack. 

As you said you have NBCSN, you can watch EVERY premier league game through NBC Sports Live Extra online by logging in through your cable provider. It is super easy, and gets you access to all 38 premier league Everton games a year.

Everton have had several Americans make a big impact on the club. First, Joe-Max Moore in the late 90s then a short stay by American legend Brian McBride in '03. Eventually, Landon Donovan had three short and successful loans to the club and Tim Howard has been a mainstay for us for years now.

Everton generally play an up tempo passing game with the stars being Romelu Lukaku (he's a beast, built like an NFL linebacker) ,England's Ross Barkley, and attacking left back Leighton Baines. 

We hate Liverpool. It is called the Merseyside Derby whenever the two teams play eachother and is always intense.  Check out this video about the Derby.

Sorry for the long response. Also, we'd love to have you in /r/mls. The 20th MLS season starts in less than a month and promises to be a great time. If you are anywhere near a club, a live soccer experience will change your life.

Edit:

Last season was one of the greatest in recent memories. Here is a pretty sweet video that gives a bit of a recap in highlight form.

A few notes:

* Sorry but it is done, and they won't change it until they decide to. The will of the BBC has spoken.
* The point of Doctor who isn't always what changes from Doctor to Doctor, but what remains the same.
* If the BBC deems it to be ""the Doctor"" it is... there is no such thing as miscasting the Doctor.

The harsh thing about long running TV shows or even movies is when people get stuck on an actor or actress. It happens a lot. Either they stay too long and you begin to hate them, or they leave too early and you miss them. Worse is when they replace them with someone you feel ""doesn't do justice to the show"" when in truth it does you are just latched onto another actor.

Some notable ""he's not My Doctor"" type moments in TV:

* Star Trek - ""the Captain Debate"" Which captain is your captain?
* Stargate (SG-1/ Atlantis) - Which General / Colonel is your favorite?
* James Bond - ""The Connery debate"" If it isn't Connery it isn't Bond

None of those are ever going to reach a consensus and that is partly on purpose and partly because people don't want to play the same role forever.

I think you will have the most long term fun with Doctor Who if you focus less on the actor the plays the Doctor and more on the Doctor himself. After 50 years of stops and starts it is pretty clear that the BBC will make changes when they want to whether you like it or not and it is ""the Greatest show in the Galaxy"" at least until something better comes along. =)",null,0,null,1424617780,null,0,1424618448,0,cotfsy6,null,t3_2wrgic,null,t1_cotfsy6,null,t3_2wrgic,null,null,null,1424729939,null,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4,null

A Motte and Bailey tactic is where you attempt to argue for something which is indefensible by only arguing for a related position which is much easier to defend. See: Mehdi Hasan arguing that Charlie Hebdo's cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad should never have been published by saying ""I believe in free speech, but I believe we have a responsibility to not offend others"".

Saying ""We should commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day, as well as these specific Memorial Days for other genocides"" is not an indefensible position. Ultimately, the decision about which atrocities to commemorate is always going to be arbitrary. What is objectionable about the SU's decision was voting it down as a matter of principle - that it is wrong to commemorate this set of dates because most of the the victims of these genocides were white Europeans, with the implication that none of the specific groups face discrimination or violence today (which is just false concerning Jews, Ukrainians and Armenians). Why didn't the SU amend the motion? Or propose an additional motion?

The new motion they passed is mealy-mouthed and pathetic:

&gt;The  current  rise  of  racism,  homophobia,  transphobia,  anti-­semitism, xenophobia,  misogyny,  Islamophobia,  and  general  bigotry  is  due  to  the current  rise  of  the  far-right. 

Their response to a motion calling for Holocaust Memorial Day was to reject it and then draw an equivocation between discrimination faced by marginalized groups today in liberal democracies and the attempted extermination of the Jews. This is disgusting.

This is not being inclusive. It's the use of identity politics to minimize the special significance of the Holocaust and other actual genocides in order to advance the causes of pet narratives of victimhood.

I answered a very similar question there the other day:

&amp;nbsp;

-----------------

I often move money around from my local account to my offshore accounts.

Moving money internationally can be troublesome, and the big banks usually want to levy rip-off fees and stick you with a lousy exchange rate far below market rates.

Personally, I use currency transfer companies such as ""[First Rate FX](https://www.firstratefx.com/)"" or ""[GCEN](https://gcen.co.uk/)""

I use First Rate FX these days as GCEN once shorted me by about $5 and I had to complain and chase them for it.

Basically these are companies registered in the UK that deal entirely with currency exchange.

The larger the volume you want to move, the closer the rate they can offer you to the mid market rate, and all trades are commission/fee free.

You have to register an account with them and go through the ""Know Your Customer"" and ""Anti Money Laundering"" checks, same as if you were opening a bank account.

Then you simply call up your broker and ask them to place a trade for you.

You say ""I want to send XXX of Currency ABC to Currency ZYX, what can you do me?""

They will look at the system and give you the rate and you can accept or refuse the deal.

if you accept, you get a written confirmation and the details of where to wire the money to.

You provide the recipient account (typically your account in the receiving currency) and then 3-4 days after you wire the money, the agreed sum arrives in that account.

For my 2 cents, this is the most efficient way to do international currency transfers :)

This is really Lovrens chance to prove himself as an opition in the starting eleven, let's hope he can build on his decent substitute-appearances these last weeks. Sakho injured/rested/dropped?

Coutinho has looked a bit devoid of ideas lately, could probably use a break to clear his head but this might not be the game for it since he will be vital in the transitions from the inevitable defending we will have to do. The Allen/Henderson midfield has looked pretty good and doesn't need changing, especially now that Sakho's out for some reason... Markovic will probably come in and do well in place of Moreno, he has looked a bit more threatening playing from the left as well, let's hope he can contribute again.

Probably sensible to let Sturridge sit the first half out considering the minutes he has gotten lately, Sterling has done a good job up front before and will probably do it again, would've been exciting to see Balotelli though...

For race as a biological signifier, yes, you're correct. But race is a real social construct, and even if it's surprisingly fluid over time (once, only North West Europeans, apart from the Irish, would have been considered white), what race you are has an important impact upon your life outcomes and how you're treated in society.

Ideally, in a theoretical society racial groups wouldn't exist. But they do, and pretending they don't exist is to turn a blind eye to the discrimination they do receive.

Last year I have a vivid memory of Flanagan starting the kickoff at midfield, and he and the other full back were often in line with Hendo/Allen/Coutinho or whomever was at the sides of the diamonds. Since Gerrard was picking up the ball so deep, our CBs were allowed to push wide into Barcelona-like positions, pushing the fullbacks up. Beginning of this year, we played almost a flat back four, and there were just no options outside. When we switched to a back 3 + Lucas, the wingbacks could push forward and provide outlets out wide. It was the same process as last year with the CBs pushing wider, except we now had Lucas and Skrtel, versus just Gerrard, between them and not attacking, which meant we had an extra man upfront. This is why I actually prefer Allen/Can (IF we can maintain clean sheets, so preferably not against the bigger clubs) to Lucas as imo they offer more to the attack. 

The key though is definitely width. We're not a crossing team, so it may not be intuitive, but width actually allows our creative players more time/space in the middle, and let's a player like Sturridge get in behind the back line.",null,0,null,1424618827,null,0,false,0,cotg6zt,null,t3_2wr72p,null,t1_cotg6zt,null,t3_2wr72p,null,null,null,1424730121,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

&gt; &gt; Possibly the most unusual starting lineup of the season. Mane is in great form so I can only assume he has taken a knock of some kind to be on the bench. Djuricic getting his first start in the senior squad; he looked great for the U21's but then we were playing Watford's youth side. I expected Reed to be in there if I'm honest. Great to see Long back in the squad; that's got to be the strongest bench we've had all season. Imagine being able to bring on Mane, Tadic and Schneiderlin to change a game. Didn't expect this lineup but I'll trust Koeman, he always seems to know what he's doing! Not feeling very optimistic if I'm honest. I hope Lambert gets a great reception, couldn't really give a toss about the other two but I wouldn't be upset to see them get a lot of shit.

By starting Sterling, he offers something Balo can't give us: better defensive contribution and a stronger chance of us winning the midfield battle against Wanyama, Schneiderlin and Davis. 

Southampton away is something I'm quite worried about - it'll be a hostile crowd due to the starts of Lovren and Lallana and their first eleven, who haven't played midweek keep in mind, will be raring to go. If we can nullify a possibly dangerous start we can substitute on Sturridge, Balotelli or Lambert if need be.

With the defence they have, if they score first, we'll have to climb a mountain to get back into it. Elia, Mané and Pellé could really do it too if we're not at the races 

Everyone's been going on about how Balotelli should start, but for this fixture and the next I don't think he should be starting as he just doesn't offer enough pressing ability for the 90 minutes. At St Mary's and away in Turkey against Bestikas we'll need to have our fair share of defending and Sterling is so much better at that.

City at home on the other hand is something we really have to go for - I can definitely see us playing two strikers from the get go and even bringing on Lambert if need be",null,0,null,1424619095,null,0,false,0,cotgaxl,null,t3_2wrj5y,null,t1_cotgaxl,null,t1_cotg4mb,null,null,null,1424730172,null,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

It completely ignores epigenetics for a start. And just because other mitochondrial genes are encoded in the nucleus doesn't mean that they would be unaffected by endogenous or transplanted mitochondrial DNA.

Mitochondria do WAY more than ""just"" make ATP, so your toilet visiting analogy is particularly crazy. What about the Warburg effect (where cancer cells switch metabolism to a more anaerobic based process)? That's still pretty much a mystery, and nobody knows how it works or what exactly is required for those changes to take place. Same with iPS cells when you reprogram them. My comment earlier was referencing the fact that the switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation seems essential for proper cell differentiation - and that mitochondria themselves act somewhat as a pluripotent factor.

Mitochondria are involved in apoptosis too - which is essential for development, as well as the healthy functioning of cells (and may be why those cancer cells switch away from using mitochondria). That's a pretty old discovery. Mitochondria are implicated in a shitload of drug toxicity problems too (Doxorubicin springs to mind).

There's a huge blurry area of metabolism, ROS, raging, cancer and pluripotency which we haven't got a clue about - but mitochondrial are heavily implicated right in the middle of it all.

The groups in question here are distinct power minorities- that's the entire reason for BME/LGBT/Women's Committees in SUs in the first place. 

As an example, relevant to this sort of thing- women's societies often get tremendously tired of being *told* exactly what their experiences with misogyny/oppression are by blockheaded white, straight, desperately naive men coming along to events like this. It can dominate discussion, and leave attendees feelign uncomfortable being fully open about their views. 

The same goes for an event like this. Why should I, as a BME (ugh, that ridiculous term) student, be obliged to sit through the ravings of some pillock that read a few pages of Rothbard and thinks he's got race relations all figured out, when they don't have a clue what they're talking about? I used to run a couple of political university societies - there was *always* a contingent of sheltered fellows coming along and babbling on about how people getting a touch narked at racism/bigotry of whatever sort should shut up and ""join the national conversation"", as they put it- which, in effect, constituted not making any noise that conflicted with their worldview. It completely derails any constructive discussion that had been going on up to that point, and, when tempers started flaring, often made the place feel actively unwelcoming for members of the minority groups in question. 

These sort of groups are meant to be constructive support, discussion and activist organisations- the utility of safe spaces lies in providing contexts where *that sort of fracas isn't a problem, and people can discuss their experiences with people who've been through the same*. 

I never spent any significant amount of time with BME/racial equality groups in my university days- never really felt the desire to. But from what I saw in other environments, there was certainly a need for that. 

As to the ""whites only"" point? Risible. People are certainly welcome to do so, the instant white people become a threatened, structurally oppressed group within society, and feel the need to have a supportive space tailored to their needs. *Nowhere* in UK universities does this sort of situation exist.

More free to break gender roles, more attempts to raise awareness of men's mental health and men's issues like depression or testicular cancer, no big wars to fight in, better clothes. 

More freedom to express yourself in clothes and more freedom to be a stay at home dad or a home maker. More freedom to do traditionally female careers and hobbies, show emotion and so on. 

Not sure why people are so determined to be victims and beg for pity and sympathy, goes to show how far we've come if men can wallow in self pity and being a victim without having their masculinity attacked and told to grow some balls and ""man up"" and stop whining like they would have done in the past.

The thing is I totally agree men have their own issues that deserve attention and activism and we don't exactly have it easy and I would totally join a men's rights movement if that's what it's about but right now they spend all their time feeling sorry for themselves and ranting about feminists than actually lobbying for law changes, enacting awareness campaigns, or basically doing anything. 

You'd think the MRA movement would have something to show for their efforts by now if they actually did what they were suppose to be doing. All they seem to do is wallow in self pity and rant about women without doing anything, which is just not something I relate to or want to take part in. And their reactions to people enquiring about gay men's rights or men's issues specific to racial minorities has been very poor from what I've seen

 When MRA's start actually addressing men's rights then I'll definitely be on board but they don't seem to want to do anything to actually improve their own groups quality of life, let alone racial minorities or gay men 


What's also frustrating is their reluctance to acknowledge men's role in perpetuating our problems. For example the vast majority of people who police my behaviour like my clothes or my emotions are other men. 

But when men talk about how they're ""not allowed"" to show emotion or do ""girly"" things they blame it on ""society"" or ""people"" and refuse to acknowledge a good chunk of men's problems, like the policing of masculinity and pressure to bottle up emotions to look tough, are perpetuated primarily by other men.

Sorry to all the Americans reading this too I know Tim Howard can do no wrong! 

Aside from that Gibbo seemed the only player who was remotely interested in winning. I can't even describe what I feel for Rom because I legitimately don't know at the moment. So yeah to top it all off an embarrassingly gutless performance at home will have Martinez speaking of the ""phenomenal passion and character"" we showed while really due to Howard being chosen no matter what the blame rests souly on Martinez. I'm not looking for him to be sacked, I do believe he's the man to bring us forward but what other top 6 club would stick by their manager with only 6 wins through the season??

I suspect that, like me, Mr Mitchell would then want them to shut up.

Of course they have a right to comment, but we mustn't make the mistake of promoting any organisation as beneficial just because we happen to agree with them on a handful of issues.

They are powerful and unelected (by the general public).

Of course we should be upset by the church meddling in politics; we should always be upset by that.

But I don't think this was meddling: I think they were outlining their moral beliefs for the benefit and guidance of their flock in the upcoming election: which they have every right to do. That's the real point.

Jags - Fantastic performance, couldn't ask for more.

Stones - Again, fantastic performance. Can't fault him.

Coleman - Solid at the back, showed some great stuff going forward.


Besic - Started great, faded badly and struggled to make an impact in either defense or attack.

McCarthy - Pure class, my MoTM.

Naismith - hard working, positive and scored a great goal, almost my MoTM.

Barkley - Horrible. Terrible. Awful. The happiest man to be subbed ever.

Lennon - Looked alright, should have done better a few times with his passes/crosses but he did look good going forward.


Lukaku - Almost as bad as Barkley.... couldn't score to save his life.

They know that once the content moves to gov.uk, they're out of a job.

All the while, you never get to actually find out what the end-users want (because they can't start using it until it's released), and the content keeps going out of date. The project then takes years to port even a single government website, doesn't actually provide any noticeable improvements and costs a colossal amount of money.

The philosophy being promoted by GDS is that you port the website as quickly as possible, make it available immediately and then keep improving it based on user feedback. Your users *will* probably experience some problems, but you're now in a position where you can make the changes needed and publish them within, say, a day or a week.

null,false,StinkyKlinky,null,null,null,"A frustrating match to equal the rest of our league form. Thoughts on each player:

Howard: At fault for both goals. RM has continually proven that he doesn't like to drop the old guard regardless of form and besides Europa this season is a bit of a write off, so I don't care too much if Howard is left in. However, he should not be our starter going into next season.

Coleman: I thought he had a great match. Defended well and really attacked the open space. Could do with some better crosses.

Stones and Jagielka: Solid with a few nervy moments but some great individual defending to make up for it. I'm also loving Stones' signature go go gadget tackles as much as Baines' signature flying karate blocks.

Baines: Pretty invisible although that is what happens when he doesn't have a winger to play off of.

Naismith: Tail of two halves. Thought he was terrible in the first half but he turned it around with a well taken goal. Seemed to give him some confidence as he started playing some nice combination passes.

McCarthy: Nothing flashy besides a great back heel to spring Lukaku. Very solid although nothing more than expected.

Besic: Didn't do much either way. While the pairing with McCarthy looked solid defensively the play was pretty slow when they were on.

Lennon: I don't know how he played the full ninety. Played as he always does good pace and can beat a man only to do nothing after wards. The biggest  positive is that he brings out a better Coleman.

Barkley: I actually thought he wasn't that terrible and I would have brought off Lennon or Naismith (judging off of the first half) first. Seemed to be fighting the ball a little but good effort. I'd still have him in the starting line up next match. Both of our chances in the first half were sprung by Barkley passes.

Lukaku: People are going to jump all over him for missing a bunch of chances and if he had been more clinical we would have walked the three points. However, people should not overlook the rest of his game. His hold up play and passing was very good this match. Players will have these types of matches where they don't get the bounces but I liked that he was getting in good positions and consistently posing a threat. How many other times have we had a striker who was invisible the whole match.

Gibson: Played some brilliant balls and looked like the Gibson of 3 injuries ago. He did benefit from Leicester playing deeper and nt having the defensive responsibilities that Besic had in the first half. Still one of the better strikers of the ball on the team. He should be gone in the summer, but I will still be looking back positively on his tenure with Everton.

Atsu: A little hit and miss but I think he warrants a continual run out as a super sub.

Mirallas: N/A

Martinez: Not a fan of his late substitutions (Mirallas only starting to warm up at the 80th) but the dropping of points is more on individual errors than tactics.

null,false,IMKridegga,tom-baker,Tom Baker,null,"I feel like the majority of your issues with Peter Capaldi aren't so much issues with the actor as with the character of the Twelfth Doctor.  

Twelve has been characterized as being very different from the other New Series Doctors.  He doesn't approach the universe with the same overly joyful enthusiasm as Ten and Eleven.  His humor is much drier and darker than Nine, Ten, and Eleven.  He's not acting happy or careless all the time to cover up PTSD from the Time War.  He's not running from anything.

In those ways and others, Twelve was always going to be a radically different character than Nine, Ten, and Eleven.  Also, remember that even though Capaldi is 56, he's playing a character who is much older than that.  The Doctor has just passed through the most stressful period of his life (for four of his lives he believed he had destroyed his own planet and doomed his own people to extinction) and now that it's over he's exhausted.  However, the universe won't give him a break.  He has the responsibility of finding Gallifrey and potentially bringing it back to our Universe.  Monsters won't stop popping up everywhere he goes.

As for Capaldi's own enthusiasm, do not be fooled by the character's attitude.  That's just a sign of Capaldi's skill as an actor ― he's putting aside all of his personal joy for playing the role so he can make his character seem unhappy.",null,0,null,1424622327,null,0,false,0,cothoor,null,t3_2wrgic,null,t1_cothoor,null,t3_2wrgic,null,null,null,1424730899,null,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4,null

It is a good career but suffers from many similar problems to other NHS careers: low morale, part of the NHS political football, shift work. However working in healthcare can provide exciting work that is hard to find in any other field. I personally hated office work and so running around all day is great for me, even if it means I have to do nights.

In regards to career progression - you can make nursing what you want it to be. Many nurses stay as 'staff nurses', but you could also do I.e clinic/endoscopy if you don't want to do out of hours work, management stuff or do a higher degree to become a specialist. I work with some amazing specialist nurses, for example diabetes nurses, haematology (who do procedures such as bone marrow aspirates) or critical care outreach nursing where many aspects of the job are similar to being a doctor.

Most of the nurses I know worked as HCAs through their degree and made reasonable money from it, especially if you do nights/weekends.

A draw in that game was no better than a loss as far as the table went once the Newcastle game went final at about 70' of our game. Instead of bringing on Defoe and/or Saha who were on the bench and going for the win, which would have seen us finish 3rd place above the Arse had we won against Fulham in the final week (which we did), Redknapp waffled a bit then brought on Parker. 

We were bossing that game despite being down a man with Bale playing as a wingback. With Bale and Lennon on the wings, bringing on Saha so they had Ade and Saha to aim for with crosses or Defoe could've been the difference. Of course it's also possible we could've been overrun in midfield and lost control of the game, but we had nothing to lose by going for the win at that point.

They makes it seem like the shop is at war against girly things or the colour pink (at least by the crappy click bait headline). But looking at the shop page its really for little girls who like dresses, pink AND dinosaurs etc. 

So it's just a shop to help parents buy clothes which can be girly and have dinosaurs if they're daughter likes both. So adding more variety to the market rather than condemning the pink girl market. Tailoring could be lot better though sadly.


From the site:](http://www.princess-awesome.com/about/)
&gt;Lots of little girls love dresses and rainbows and flowers and pink.  And lots of those same little girls love cars and robots and pirates and dinosaurs. 

&gt;But if you've ever tried to buy those little girls clothes that are pink and have dinosaurs, or are sparkly and have pirates, or even just a dress with a robot on it, then you know it's pretty much impossible. 

&gt;We believe that if a girl likes purple and also likes trucks, she should be able to wear a purple truck dress. And if a girl likes princesses and also aliens, then an alien princess skirt is for her.

&gt;We also believe that if a girl would prefer to skip the ""princess"" and stick with the ""awesome,"" she deserves some dress options that feature a range of colors and topics.

&gt;We are Princess Awesome because butterflies are awesome and so are airplanes. Because monsters are awesome and so are twirly skirts. Because girls are awesome and girls get to decide what it means to be girly.",null,0,null,1424623411,null,0,1424623879,0,coti727,null,t3_2wqxy5,null,t1_coti727,null,t3_2wqxy5,null,null,null,1424731137,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

The right has been corrupted because it has to pander not just to the middle-right (which is probably where the 'median voter' sits), but also to the far right which has always been here.

**Good old fashioned** conservatism was about simply, doing what's right instead of what's popular. If that meant literally costing people their lives for the greater good, that was fine. A good old fashioned conservative in the ""kill a child to save a thousand"" scenario would take that deal every day of the week.

Modern conservatives are essentially straddling the line between trying to dress up policies people don't like whilst also introducing completely uneccesary and bad policies to pander to their voters and their donors.

On the donors; just interesting to point out that for the 2010 election, the conservative party spend £1559 per thousand votes, vs £931 for Labour and £700 for the liberal democrats. They can't really afford to *not* pander to the loony-tunes squad, they literally are buying elections with their money.

    Can they enter my house for an inspection?

Not without your permission. 

    If I refuse entry, can they walk around my garden and look in my windows, even after I ask them to leave?

If you've asked them to leave your property that means (old fashioned word coming up here) to the curtilage of the property. Ie it includes any gardens or immediately surrounding buildings. There would be nothing to stop them looking from outside the curtilage of the property though. If after having asked them to leave they do not you do have the right to use reasonable force to remove them from your property but no further. If they attempt to hit you etc then its assault against you. However I would recommend recording this and recording asking them to leave for best evidence. 

    Can they get a warrant to see my house even if there is no indication that I own a TV? (No cable/satellite subscription, no antennas)

In theory yes but in 9 years of being a police officer I cannot remember ever being asked to assist with such a warrant (we are routniely asked to assist in the execution of warrants for other enforcement agencies. They would need to show enough evidence to show suspicion of you having a TV which is capable of receiving signals. 
    Can they summon me to court when they don't even seem to know our names?

No any summons would have to specify a name as you cannot summon a ""legal occupier"" etc. They could if they wanted get your name from the voters register. 

    Can they summon me to court without evidence that we own a TV?

Very unlikely. The prosecution would have to go through the CPS (crown prosecution service) and they're not in the habit of prosecuting people even with all the evidence in the world. 

    Am I required to go to court or defend myself in court when I have committed no offense and there can be no proof that I committed an offense (since I didn't do it)? Surely we are presumed innocent until there is at least some evidence to the contrary?

It would be for the prosecution to prove the case. If they aren't offering evidence which proves the offence beyond all reasonable doubt you cannot be found guilty of an offence. Your defence may simply be ""the prosecution is not offering any evidence.""

And yes, privilege exists. Privilege does not mean that you automatically have an easier life in the sense of material comfort, it means that you have an easier life *in general* than someone who *doesn't* have privilege. A person in an ethnic minority could have the same life experiences you do, however you were shat on, but still come off the worse due to the innate racial prejudices many people have - the assumption that they are criminals, illegal immigrants, paedophiles etc, being subject to racist abuse... again, the point is not that all privileged people necessarily have easier or better lives, it is that people without that privilege have more barriers in their way to contend with.",null,0,null,1424624482,null,0,false,0,cotiq6a,null,t3_2wr4gn,null,t1_cotiq6a,null,t1_cotid3y,null,null,null,1424731385,null,5,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,5,null

I **am** claiming our understanding of mitochondrial genetics is sufficient to understand the ramifications of 2.infinitesimal parent children.

I'm not precisely sure what you imagine epigentics has to say about the issue. I grant entirely that the mitochondrial dna is particularly susceptible to both damage and de novo mutation, but that is true for any set of mitochondrial DNA - including the one being replaced - the technique isn't pretending to eradicate metabolic disease, and it's possible a damaged donor genome will be used at some point, but then the ethicists have already spent rather a long time churning over all this.

I'm actually curious if you have a specific objection, query, or concern about any part of the process involved, or if you're just going to cast hopelessly vague aspersions. The closest you've come is the Warburg effect, but my understanding is that the thesis Warburg himself proposed was superceded over a decade ago and the generally accepted theory is that anaerobic cancer metabolism is primarily a consequence of selective pressure given that tumour growth outpaces angiogenesis. This is really a separate discussion though. If we accept that damaged, suppressed or inhibited mitochondrial function is a factor in tumour growth, can we either discuss this separaterly elsewhere or move on?

You appear to have named pretty much every function of the eukaryotic cell as something potentially threatened by inept tinkering, but given that we know what we are replacing, what we are replacing it with, and the set of possible interactions those proteins can make in the cellular environment (remember, it's a **very** small set of proteins) we actually have a better theoretical basis for this than most of modern medicine.",null,0,null,1424624650,null,0,1424625047,0,cotitcb,null,t3_2wobrw,null,t1_cotitcb,null,t1_cotghzz,null,null,null,1424731426,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

People are complaining about Sam's choices but it's easy to say this stuff in hindsight and if the match had only had four minutes stoppage time we would have all been singing his praises. Maybe bringing on Nolan would have kept our shape better than Cole, but I think in context it wasn't really a bad decision, it just didn't turn out well. What I'm more annoyed about is the mentality of the manager and the squad at this point, dropping so many points from winning positions is usually indicative of more than just mistakes from the manager, but a mental block of some kind with the players.

Howard tries to tip it out of the path of the goal, gets a solid hand to it but it hits Stones and then goes on to fall right infront of Nugent. More down to luck than anything because you wouldn't have wanted Howard to let it run across the 6 yard box.

Exhibit 2: The second goal.
Again Howard attempts to tip it away (probably should have caught it but the ball dipped awkwardly behind him). Coleman was too slow going out to their player and Cambiasso was left alone by Atsu to put it in.

The ""I'm not anti-Semitic, I'm anti-Israel!"" whine is a tiresome and repulsive cliche. Nobody is impressed by your little semantic games. If you were actually concerned with justice and peace in the Middle East you would take care to separate out the various political groups within Israel and try to understand what Israelis themselves actually think about the policies towards the Palestinians. If you were actually concerned about anti-Semitism in Britain, you would listen to British Jews who are frightened about how vicious rhetoric is towards the Jewish State and who worry that it normalises anti-Semitism and violence towards Jews in this country.

Two questions:

Question One: Do you think Israel can make peace with Hamas, whilst the latter's policy is still the complete destruction of Israel and it refuses to consider any hypothetical peace with Israel anything but a truce pending a future war with Israel?

What about a 'BME' who disagrees with what a BME society has decided to be the truth? Or a 'member of the LGBT community' who doesn't believe in the LGBT society's doctrine? Should they not be allowed to attend this kind of conversation either? What if these people are made to feel uncomfortable, and unwelcome to disagree or to differ? 

&gt;
Why should I, as a BME (ugh, that ridiculous term) student, be obliged to sit through the ravings of some pillock that read a few pages of Rothbard and thinks he's got race relations all figured out, when they don't have a clue what they're talking about?
&gt;

I hear you that it must be impractical to keep having to go over the basics over and over again, and it's an inconvenience when people disagree with you, but if you want to create change, surely you actually engage in conversation. This is exactly what politics is all about, isn't it? 

There must be a better way of dealing with people with differing views or experiences - whether it's convenient or not - than to just exclude whole members of society based on their sex, orientation and the colour of their skin without even hearing what they have to say... And denying them the right to even hear the other sides experience, view, or argument. I think that they should have this right in a place of learning.

Is your argument really that it's okay to exclude white, straight and male people because it's more convenient?

That's exactly what organisations like this do through activism. Which they *do* engage in. 

That does *not* mean that they must, of necessity, open every single event they have to the National Front. The two can be separate.

&gt;There must be a better way of dealing with people with differing views or experiences - whether it's convenient or not - than to just exclude whole members of society based on their sex, orientation and the colour of their skin without even hearing what they have to say... And denying them the right to even hear the other sides experience, view, or argument. I think that they should have this right in a place of learning.
&gt;
&gt;Is your argument really that it's okay to exclude white, straight and male people because it's more convenient? 

They have literally *every single other event societies like this run* to turn up to. Given that the *entire purpose* of a BME support/activism organisation is to cater to the needs of BME students on campus, bending over backwards to cater to people outside their remit isn't necessary. 

I occasionally turn up to events run by my university's Feminist Society/Women's Committee. I'm entirely welcome. That does *not* mean that I *have* to turn up to every single one- indeed, if they were to host something like a closed discussion for rape survivors and societal attitudes they've had to deal with, then I absolutely wouldn't turn up, because that space is, explicitly, *not for me*.

null,false,grelch,null,null,null,"I just finished watching. Going to throw our thoughts as they come. Won't be at all cogent. 1) We threw this match away. It was in the bag. For some reason we decided to drop all of our players into our own third (presumably Sam ordered this) and stop pressing. We gave them 5 to 10 yards cushion on the ball in our own final third. I don't care if you're playing Rochdale, if you give a professional player time and space on the ball they will hurt you.  There was absolutely no reason to fall back. Spurs hadn't regained control of the match, we were still causing them serious problems on the counter. Ericksen's arrival didn't change the match. We simply ceded control and the match to them. It's literally like a switch was flipped and off we went. We gave them the ball and basically said , here help yourselves. 2) Mark Noble should have been sent off. We were very very fortunate. Beyond that, I'm starting to feel like he's a bit of a liability. He's simply too slow, too ponderous on the ball and increasingly committing bad fouls because of it. 3) It was a penalty. All day long. Yes, Kane went down on his own, but the fact of the matter is that Song pushed him in the back. In 1977 that's not even a foul. In 2015 it's a foul. Song was 100% at fault. 4) It's a good point, we played very well for 80% of the match. While pleased overall with the performance and with the way we played, I'm particularly frustrated because we gave them the point. They didn't earn it.

- Killinchy/Killyleagh/Crossgar - 
Pros: very scenic area, close to Strangford Lough.  Small villages.  Lots of countryside options.   Cons: somewhat isolated &amp; long commute into Belfast, pricey in areas.
 
- Carryduff/Saintfield - Bigger towns, with more to do.  Easy commute into East Belfast.  Difficult commute into other parts of Belfast.  Still kind of isolated as off main roads.

- A1 Corridor - Hillsborough environs (ie. Annahilt etc.)/Banbridge (Dromore is a commuterville hole covered in flegs).   Pros - Great for shopping, great access to East &amp; Central Belfast via M1.  Easy access to Dublin, Dublin Airport (cheaper flights), and the south.   Easy access to many good secondary schools.   One of the faster growing areas of NI.    Cons: Hillsborough area can be expensive.   By the time you get to Banbridge, the commute can easily exceed 45 min if you're in peak commute times. 

- Moira/Donaghcloney - Good Access to M1.  Easy access to Craigavon shopping &amp; Belfast.  Small towns, fairly quiet.  Cons: Moira roundabout, perpetual traffic.  A bit ""one sided"" if that bothers you.

If you don't want to live in town - and are OK living 5-10 min from a main road, you can find some fantastic countryside properties for  under 200K.   As the other poster said, I'd check Propertynews as well as Propertypal.     We're also starting to look for a bigger place  similar to your requirements.

Even on actual knowledge of medical a person who specialised in Rheumotology for instance doesn't necessarily know enough about neurological issues. Perhaps more understanding is needed of the frontline issue but that is why one has advisers and doctors working with the ministers. As said though even if a minister WAS a doctor they would still require the same advisers and specialists on areas they didn't work in and they would still have to make allocations of finite resources.

BTW, you can easily trial any of these SIMs on a PAYG (Pay As You Go) account which you top up on a monthly/30-day basis. Just add credit as you need it. Then move to a monthly or yearly plan afterwards.

null,false,FezojT,null,null,null,"&gt;Need to be able to describe the charge changes on a capacitor? Do an experiment where you calculate the charge/discharge on a capacitor over time

Sounds like a waste of time to me. I'm in the master's year of a physics degree and I've been through all this. At best what you would achieve would be a confirmation of the capacitor discharge model outlined to you in the course, so why introduce the middle man? Just sit with the equation and play with that; if you want to see what happens if you use larger resistors, just take the limit as R -&gt; infinity. By doing experiments, you won't magically see the physical intuition behind the model. For that you need to think about it, which isn't what you'll be doing when you're arsing around with oscilloscopes and capacitors.  

A far more efficient use of your time would be to look in an appropriate textbook if your notes aren't explaining things to you. I guess you get points for trying to think outside the box, but there are no shortcuts when it comes to learning. You're just going to have to read notes/textbooks and practice exam-style questions over and over again. I tend to find flash cards a waste of time (though apparently they work for some people), and just find it more useful to re-write my notes in a condensed format, just picking out key points (reducing a 30 lecture module down to 5 sides of A4 or so).

With that said, I'm not going to sit here and say I was all that convinced with our performance. We weren't as solid as we needed to be, and I think it arose from our midfield. Allen and Hendo were basically doing the same job (recycling possession), to the point where neither of them offered anything going forward. Without a DM to cover only defensive responsibilities (Lucas or someone), we get very little going forward from our midfield. IMO anyway.

Second goal: the cross never dipped awkwardly. It wasn't deflected and it was a routine collect for a regular goalkeeper. Howard misjudged the flight of the cross and had to tip it. Maybe Coleman could have reacted a bit quicker but I think the entire blame is on Howard. It's like saying the defenders should run to the goal line to in anticipation to do a goal line clearance whenever a back pass towards the keeper is made. 95% of the time, the keeper would have collected the cross.

We dominated the game, we dominated chances, we didn't sit on possession, we got the ball forward as and when we needed- but we were undone by 2 utterly stupid goalkeeping errors and the inability of a renowned clinical finisher to hit the back of the net. 

Everyones complaints about Martinez have been related to sitting on possession and not getting the ball up to Lukaku when his back isn't to goal. Well, today he hardly touched the ball with his back to goal, but he just couldn't finish the stone wall chances our play (and, may I add, our system) allowed for him. 

Did we sit on the ball in defence? Nope. Only 4 teams had more final third passes. Did we fail to create chances? Nope, only Spurs created more. But they were all long range blasts right? Only 1 team had more shots in the box than us this weekend. 

The gaffers tactics were spot on, they capitalised on the weaknesses of Leicester and allowed us to run all over them (especially down the right, where IMO the use of Lennon was very smart, looking similar to Pienaar on the left of 4 years back), by using tactics that were gameplan specific and were tough for Leicester to prepare for. 

The only thing we can really point fingers at Martinez for is stuff we have no idea about as fans. Should Mirallas have started? Who knows how fit he is. Should Joel have started? Who knows how well they have done on the training pitch. Should Barkley have started, or should we only have a process of pushing youth when it works in hindsight?

Player ratings /10:

Mignolet - 8 played very well and saved us a few times. MOTM

Lovren - 4 rash challenge as usual and rightly booked, positionally poor but was better second half.

Skrtel - 5 charged out leaving us exposed a lot.

Can - 5 not great from the big man, but he was needlessly moved to the otherside and markovic didn't offer a lot of protection. Better when moreno was on.

Ibe - 6 another good game from him, didn't have much chance to make an impact with the team underperforming

Henderson - 5, poor from the captain elect.

Allen - 5 living up to his reputation of offering nothing except making the midfield porous.

Markovic - 5 a LWB he is not, did try though but out his depth against Clyne.

Coutinho - 6 what a goal! Full of tricks but kept quiet by his standards

Sterling - 6 redeemed by the goal, disjointed performance from him all round, sloppy passing.

Lallana - 4 poor contribution, looks nowhere near a £25m player after another anonymous performance

Subs:

Moreno - 6 attacked the wing well and important in the second goal, also offered Can more protection and gave us a better shape

Sturridge - 6 glimpses of finding form again, good passing and direct play, arguably could have done better with his shots.

Johnson - 6 wasn't on that long, did his job and packed the defence. No complaints",null,0,null,1424629709,null,0,false,0,cotliem,null,t3_2ws1z7,null,t1_cotliem,null,t3_2ws1z7,null,null,null,1424732684,null,-12,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-12,null

Aimlessly, and creating chances don't really go in the same sentence. We were making long passes, but we were not just hitting a ball into an area- they were finding feet, and making threats. That also sounds like a plan B, however you want to spin it?

&gt; Again I'm talking about the whole season, and todays game was no different.

Todays game was very different for me. We utilised a tactical style that we have not done this year at all (a defensive winger on the right, allowing more aggressive use of the overlap) and we switched to another style- focused on killer balls down the middle- which again we have hardly done all year. 

I agree that before New Year we were in a rut, but the style we plan now is absolutely poles apart from the style we played then. Yes, we were holding the ball in defence far too much, we were building up too slow and thusly we were not creating chances. 

Today we moved the ball quickly and effectively. We played some pretty beautiful one touch, progressive football (not one touch, cautious football, as has been too common recently) and we opened up the defence time and again. 

This was not the turgid play that was scared to make an error that we saw in the last few months of 2014. This was a style coming together, but being pulled apart by individual errors (Which the manager can do absolutely nothing about). 

On another day we win this game 4-1 (I will give them the 46th minute goal, as I have no clue how he didn't put that in) and people are talking about what a great manager Martinez is, and how his gameplan specific style can work with the Euro congestion.

After two years with an A2, you'll be able to retake your test and get a full licence (A), at which point you can ride anything you wish. You can't have an A licence untilt you're 24, or you've got two years experience with an A2 licence.

There are plenty of places to get your licence. You'll usually do a four/five/six day course (depending on your skill) which will teach you everything you need to know and also take your tests. You could also just take the tests without the training, but they're hard tests and depending on your skill you might want to do the course. You'll need to do Mod1 and Mod2. Mod1 consists of basic stuff riding around a training area. There are some good videos on YT about this. Mod2 means riding around town for a few hours with an examiner following you and telling you what to do.

Well written sentence there.

In general (and somewhat like Prognosis) these findings may not say much more than the existence of a materialist bias around medically interested literate people.

&gt; It’s a bit like someone buying products in a supermarket based simply on what’s written on the back of their packets, *or choosing which supermarket to visit based on the claims set out in their advertising*. Like it or not, ‘brands’ can communicate far more information than advertising bumpf, and allows us to consider our own understanding and existing knowledge about the products in question.

Nonsense. There is a big difference between advertising and the stuff on the back of the packet. Looking at the back of the packet is the alternative.

&gt; In other words, the realism of these political platforms are not taken into account, or even presented as a relevant consideration, while people are choosing between manifestos on ‘Vote for Policies’.


Valid point after you choose your policies you should also be told what percentage of policies from the past manifesto a party then carried out in power when they had the chance.

Like AAV has done here http://anotherangryvoice.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/tory-contract-kick-us-out-in-5-years.html?m=1

Also as a green I must say we had a fully costed manifesto in 2010, and will have again in 2015. This was independently assessed.

This author could barely get a grade at GCSE level politics / sociology. I doubt any English / Philosophy teacher would do anything but cringe at 

not say much more than the existence of a left-wing bias around politically interested internet users. 

ffs at least re-read and put

Mané made a real difference as his runs were always forwards and he brought others into the game. Pellè was more concerned with holding up play which, whilst being important, is redundant when there's no partner for him to play it off to.   

Schneiderlin looked alright but was clearly frustrated by the lack of ambition going forward, as was Wanyama who seemed hell bent on just taking on the whole team. I don't blame him since no one was making any kind of decent movement around the box.  

Frustrating. We don't have a chance of scoring against a West Brom side managed by Tony Pulis. They will shut us out and hit us on the break, just like Liverpool and Swansea did. Depressing.

null,false,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,null,"&gt; It would be great if we didn't play with 2 defensive midfielders every single game, especially against bottom of the table shite.

Having 2 defensive midfielders allows for Baines especially to open up. There have been a few times when we have only played 1 (or Osman filled in as the second), and the overlap has been non-existent. Whilst I feel that Barkley could be pushed back there to offer more creativity (as he was played, I think vs QPR pre Xmas), he is also potentially a huge liability there. 

&gt; Howard should never have come back in, but Martinez puts him in immediately, despite Howard being abysmal all season and Robles not putting a foot wrong

We don't know what happens on the training ground. 

&gt; Why does he persist with only one proper winger each game? 

I admit this one is a bit of a head scratcher, but the inside forward has worked pretty well at times. Lukaku is not the sort of player who will be getting tap ins at the far post (Europa excluded), so I can see the logic of having an inside forward who will ghost in. This was hugely successful earlier in the season with Naismith or Coleman on the overlap, however the opposition seems to be planning for it a bit better. 

&gt; Trying to force both Naismith and Barkley into the same team, when it just doesn't work

I think they can plan in the team together just fine. As I said above, Naismith offers work rate and aggression as an inside forward, and (when on form) Barkley is a firecracker in the middle, especially in the transition. The problem isn't playing them both in the side, it is Barkley's lack of form. That certainly raises another question of 'why hasn't he been dropped more permanently'- but again, we don't know how he has trained this week, and it is not like he is nailed on the team sheet. 

&gt; Why wait until the 82nd minute to bring on Mirallas? 

If he was fit, then this is a question mark. But for all we know he could have had a soft tissue injury that the manager didn't want to risk- you don't push injury prone players. You are again casting judgements without knowing any of the circumstances. 

&gt; Why not give Kone a go now and then if said misfiring Striker is still misfiring

Hindsight is 20-20. 'Misfiring striker' just came off a hat trick. And for all his misses did manage to get the equaliser today. Remember also that chances are not handed to strikers on a plate, it was his speed and movement that got him in the position to miss. Also, Kone's finishing is, at best, very mediocre.

UK system is you take a CBT to become a learner and with that for the next two years you may ride a 125cc bike unsupervised as long as you don't go on the motorway or carry passengers. You can then (within the two years of the CBT) take the bike test on the 125 but it's pretty useless for your age, you'll only be allowed to ride a 125 but you can carry a passenger and do motorway stuff. I'd say don't do this as 125s lose their grin factor after a few months. That and theres only so much to learn to not fuck up on a 125.

At the age of 19 you can take the test for a 46bhp bike. To do this you will need a training school/instructor who will follow you on lessons with a radio to tell you what to do. You cannot ride a 46bhp bike by yourself, you will have to cough up for lessons. You'll need a CBT, a motorcycle theory test and then you'll do the mod 1 and 2 on the 46bhp bike with your instructor.

What does this mean for your 250 plan?
You'll need to do a CBT, theory and both parts of the test with an instructor on a 46bhp bike. If all goes well you will be allowed to ride bikes that have a max power output of 46bhp, whether that be due to it being a small bike (eg 250 ninja) or a big bike restricted down (though in it's unrestricted form it can't be more than twice the restricted power, so you cant have a fireblade with a restrictor to 46bhp, das ist verboten). After two years with this 46bhp you can retake your mod 1 and 2 on an unrestricted bike with an instructor to gain a full bike license and be free to do what you like - you don't have to but it seems reasonable to progress.

As for the 250 Ninja, I would say ignore it buy a second hand 500/600 (Xj600, cb500, gs500 etc) and have it restricted/fit a restrictor. Reason being they are cheap (500-1000 will get you a bike in pretty good condition) and everyone has had one so parts are cheap and plentiful as is the knowledge on how to fix them. You also get a brand new bike when you pull the restrictors out if you take the unrestricted test. Just look out for ex-courier bikes and ex-school bikes - they have been abused and dropped repeatedly. I'd also say do the test first, then worry about which bike you want, as you are 19 with no experience it will be less which bike you can afford and more which bike you can afford to insure.

tl;dr - go for the A2/46bhp license, fuck the 125s and jump to a restricted 500.",null,0,null,1424631015,null,0,1424631650,0,cotm7sd,null,t3_2ws3hz,null,t1_cotm7sd,null,t3_2ws3hz,null,null,null,1424733013,null,3,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,3,null

The season before was his very first season, and the beginning of this season was his worst time at the club, I agree. But do you not see any of the promising signs? Has he not achieved decent results straight away by taking us to 2nd in his 2nd season? Are we not seeing a team being built with a lot of potential?

Yeah it's not perfect. I would love it if we could win all our matches. But all things considered we are now within distance of a CL finish. If we miss it by a few points is that really reason enough to sack a manager that is building a promising project? I don't think the club should be that severe.

He is basically a liability atm anyway. When teams sit back, or defend in numbers, he's basically completely ineffective. Putting him deeper, i.e. that QPR game, and he can actually run at defences rather than being isolated.

&gt; We don't know what happens on the training ground.

Err so? We know what happens on the pitch. 

&gt; If he was fit, then this is a question mark. But for all we know he could have had a soft tissue injury that the manager didn't want to risk- you don't push injury prone players. You are again casting judgements without knowing any of the circumstances.

Was fit enough to be named on the bench and come on, and looked fine. Giving him 10 minutes at the end when it's obvious to everyone a change needed to be made. Not good enough. 

&gt; Hindsight is 20-20. 'Misfiring striker' just came off a hat trick. And for all his misses did manage to get the equaliser today. Remember also that chances are not handed to strikers on a plate, it was his speed and movement that got him in the position to miss. Also, Kone's finishing is, at best, very mediocre.

He was missing chances left right and centre. But regardless, why not try 2 up top for once. It's against bottom of the table shite at home, why not go for it?

You just made it it painfully obvious that you're not looking for a discussion, instead you and /u/podpool3 just dismiss anyone who disagrees with you. Either you want a discussion or you don't. Don't make snide threads asking for peoples opinions and have the first comment dismissing the people that your thread is directed to out of hand. It's ridiculous shit I'd expect from an ""edgy"" teenager.

To actually answer your point, just because he has won a game against Southampton does not make up for the collapse earlier in the season, people keep saying he has turned our season around *(and he has been doing that for the last 3 seasons apparently with not a trophy in sight)* but he also got us into this mess in the first place even though he spent a load of money and there was also the idiotic statements about Spurs and Southampton, if we do not win a trophy and do not get back into Europe then this season is a failure and that means Rodgers has failed as a manager. He has been given a vast amount of resources and has achieved very little with them. If this season is a failure then I would want him to be fired. There is every chance he will succeed, but I'd like to see actual results not simply attempts.

And to you and /u/podpool3 *(Who also had a habit of making pointless threads a while back)* beating Southampton does not make you a great manager, if it did then we'd be having the same conversation about Sean Dyche.

If you are looking to have a reasonable discussion then I'd like a conversation and would welcome your opinion, if you just want to be a snide little person who makes threads for arguments then please go away.

*Edit: People are misconstruing this as an anti-Rodgers rant, it is not, and I have clarified my opinion in this comment and on others. I don't believe in sacking managers mid season, instead I believe in waiting until the end of a season to see the progress made, this is why I'm not (and never was) asking for Rodgers to be fired nor am I calling him the next great Liverpool manager, I'm willing to wait until the end of the season and then see if Rodgers has supplied success.*",null,0,null,1424631926,null,0,1424633776,0,cotmpsu,null,t3_2ws32a,null,t1_cotmpsu,null,t1_cotl44a,null,null,null,1424733246,null,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11,null

It is contradictory that you say Kone has been fine since coming back, so should be in the side. And although Howard looked very strong up until today.. he should be dropped? 

We see the players for 90 minutes per week, and Bobby sees them for 5-9 hours per day. The manager will use his judgement, and vastly superior knowledge of player form to make the decisions. Yes, you can shout all you like from the sidelines, but it is akin talking about a book having only read the bleub. 

&gt;He is basically a liability atm anyway. When teams sit back, or defend in numbers, he's basically completely ineffective. Putting him deeper, i.e. that QPR game, and he can actually run at defences rather than being isolated.

He ran at defences from the number 10 spot last season with great effectiveness. I can see why Martinez is playing him, especially considering he might have been on it all week in training, and the kid needs game time. 

If he was playing every game I would be more annoyed, but as I say- he is not nailed on, and would not be surprised if he was dropped again next week. 

&gt;Was fit enough to be named on the bench and come on, and looked fine. Giving him 10 minutes at the end when it's obvious to everyone a change needed to be made. Not good enough.

It is all about balancing risk. The physio may have recommended him not play, but maybe Bobby felt 10 minutes was worth the risk for the chance of an extra point or 3. If it was a soft tissue injury, then he would have looked fine- that is the nature of the injury, and the recovery process from them.

You are making judgements without knowing anything- you are actively looking for issues, so that you can bash the manager, rather than objectively assessing the situation. I have criticised our managers in the past, and will certainly do so in the future. But I also concede that they know a hell of a lot more than me. Both about the players, and about the game- and anything that I think they have done wrong is just further evidence of the Dunning–Kruger effect, which this whole conversation is pretty much a thesis in.

null,false,Gazebadly,null,null,null,"Fair enough. I'm no great fan of organised religion and there are things my wife's employer (the CofE) do that I don't like at all.

However in this case I believe they are reminding their own members of the teachings of Jesus (rather than any policy of the church) and how that relates to making moral choices regarding voting. Jesus said be kind to the poor, the church says remember his teachings when you vote, some politicians have perceived that as an attack on them. I think that so much more about those politicians than it does about the church.

Like many organisations the church can do good and bad, often at the same time. And it seems fair enough to praise and the good and criticise the bad - without being labelled as wholeheartedly supporting that organisation or conversely being an enemy of it. 

I see the situation in my local area as being a somewhat odd one. There are plenty of wealthy people here who are members of the Anglican Church. They do lots of good - they give to the foodbank, are very generous with money to the church (which is used for good causes) and give so much time and energy. Yet they vote for the policies that leave so many in need. 

Imagine if every month a government van arrived on a poor estate and let out wolves which were allowed to attack the poor people who lived there. Afterwards the rich Christians of the parish arrived and comforted the injured, helped those in need and did their very best to support those hurt by the wolves. But every five years at the polling booth they ticked the box next to ""release wolves on the poor"".

The disparity between those who help the poor on an individual/local basis - and their views on a national level drives my poor wife potty at times. It's like they can't extrapolate their obvious caring intentions to wider political policies. That said there are plenty of (often older) members of the church round here who will say things (quietly) like ""the foodbank isn't for their sort"" when some obviously very poor, needy and likely substance abuser comes in for some food. Yes it is for their ""sort"", that rather was Jesus' point.

1. Terrible media management - He really can't keep his mouth shut and it's embarrassing. It happens almost every week I don't need to list out them all but obviously the worst ones are ; ""Southampton have a choice"", ""categorically tell you that Balotelli won't be joining us"" and ""if you spend 100 million you've got to be challenging for the league"". Arrogance is embarrassing when you've got a manager who wins things but horrible when you've got one who hasn't won anything (yet)
1. Transfers - Brendan's said lots of times he has the last say on transfers [(Source)](http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/brendan-rodgers-liverpool-fc-transfer-7185770), so he's culpable for all of our failings in the transfer signings, that includes the decision to sign so many players. I don't completely buy the ""bedding in"" argument because look at teams such as Southampton who have integrated a new spine seamlessly (with much less financial power). Nonetheless nobody forced him to buy so many players, and no-one forced him to buy Balotelli either.
1. At the time he was being horribly rigid in his play style and had reverted to his impotent ""possession"" football and I felt his lack of answers was ridiculous, obviously this has changed.

He's certainly improved, credit to him, but i'm not convinced that him having some good games makes up for how bad he was, he's always been an excellent shot stopper but I think the turn around in fortunes is down to a few factors, the whole team improving, Can at the back, Lucas in DM and the change in formation, all

We see the players for 90 minutes per week, and Bobby sees them for 5-9 hours per day. The manager will use his judgement, and vastly superior knowledge of player form to make the decisions. Yes, you can shout all you like from the sidelines, but it is akin talking about a book having only read the bleub.

For sub appearances/starting alongside Lukaku, it's obviously different for a goalkeeper. And he hasn't looked strong, at all, all season. And I said he should never have been brought back in, if you're counting the Young Boys and Chelsea games.
Let's never discuss things ever, and close down this subreddit and forums because the Manager never makes mistakes. Brilliant. 

&gt; He ran at defences from the number 10 spot last season with great effectiveness. I can see why Martinez is playing him, especially considering he might have been on it all week in training, and the kid needs game time.
If he was playing every game I would be more annoyed, but as I say- he is not nailed on, and would not be surprised if he was dropped again next week.

I know he did, but that was last season, and it's obviously not working this season. 

&gt; It is all about balancing risk. The physio may have recommended him not play, but maybe Bobby felt 10 minutes was worth the risk for the chance of an extra point or 3. If it was a soft tissue injury, then he would have looked fine- that is the nature of the injury, and the recovery process from them.
You are making judgements without knowing anything- you are actively looking for issues, so that you can bash the manager, rather than objectively assessing the situation. I have criticised our managers in the past, and will certainly do so in the future. But I also concede that they know a hell of a lot more than me. Both about the players, and about the game- and anything that I think they have done wrong is just further evidence of the Dunning–Kruger effect, which this whole conversation is pretty much a thesis in.

Assuming he's even injured. 
What? We all do, every fan does without knowing how each training session went, etc. We judge on performances, results, etc just like Kenwright and co. Concede that they make mistakes as well, then. And dunno what the 'Dunning-Kruger effect' comment/bollocks is attempting to insinuate.

What comments? I keep saying I like to wait until the end of a season to see how a manager has done, I'm not advocating ""Sack Rodgers"" I'm advocating a ""Wait and see"" approach, that has been my opinion throughout this season. I'm not sticking by any ""Sack Rodgers"" argument, because as I've said I don't agree with sacking managers mid-season. Please read what I say more closely.

null,false,moby414,null,null,null,"Hey! Here's my wall of text in response, I've lived in Cambs for over 25 years :)

1) Is that $3000 per month?! It really depends on your budget and what type of place you want. Living in the city centre is *seriously* expensive if you want something half decent. For a single bed in a flat within walking distance of most places, you're looking at around £600 per month and then bills on top. The student rental market has totally saturated the 'young-professional' market and estate agents can pretty much offer up total dumps for a fairly high price because there will be some students willing to pay that, so be careful! Whereas if you live outside of the city in one of the close villages (the west and north are nice with easy access to the city) then you'll be able to rent large detached houses for the equivalent of a small room in the the city centre. For example, myself and 3 friends rented an amazing detached, modern house for £1500pm including bills that was only a 10min drive/bus, 30min cycle into the centre. Look at websites such as [rightmove](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/), [zoopla](http://www.zoopla.co.uk/), [gumtree](http://www.gumtree.com/) and [spareroom](https://www.spareroom.co.uk/). 

2) I own a car and never use it when I'm moving around the city, the roads suck and there is **always** congestion at peak times. Parking is a nightmare unless you've lived here a while and know where the free spaces are, the multi-stories will charge you a fortune and a lot of central business don't offer a space as they expect you to have cycled/walked or got the train in.

3) For nursing, have a look at the two main hospitals in the area - Addenbrookes and Hinchinbrookes (they're about 20 miles apart). Also check out the [NHS Jobs site](https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/), maybe there's some help there? For teaching, there are hundreds of primary (ages 4-11), secondary (11-16), sixth forms (16-19) and also 2 universities. Teaching at any level these days requires a formal degree in education but you may be able to start as a teaching assistant and move up from there. The [County Council](http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/) will probably have information on both schools and nursing to start you off.

4) Making friends is easy I think, the University hosts literally hundreds of clubs and societies for all interests that are open to non-university members (I'm part of the Yacht and Astronomy Clubs for example) so have a quick google and go from there. There is a great 'pub-scene' in Cambridge too. Again literally hundreds of great local pubs to try local beers and food, and meet local people.

5) As other people suggested, if you have an unlocked phone, you can get a great deal in the £10-15 market. Either buy a sim online or go into a shop, I've found that if you're not a total tech-noob, you don't get shafted by phone salesmen.

I hope this helps, pm me for more specific info if you want to :)

A few things.

First, the problem people have with SRS is the same problem people have with Safe Spaces; namely, those that inhabit SRS also expect the world outside SRS to also conform to their rules, and loudly pout, scream and stamp in public whenever it doesn't. They show up in most subreddits are tiresomely complain about some minor slight being the worst -phobic attack on the year that literally triggers them into oblivion and means reddit is an ultra far-right hate site.

Second, no you can't debate anywhere in any SRS sub. They have subs they *state* are for debate, but like in the rest of the Safe Space, dissent will ultimately be banned.

Beyond that, taking supplements is not unique to vegans or vegetarians. Plenty of people take supplements for all kinds of things.

So, in light of the above, humans do not need to eat animals to survive and be healthy. Nutrients come from plants which take them from the earth, air and water, and animals eat plants to get those nutrients. Carnivores eat meat because they have to, humans eat meat because they *can* - it is an option that they can use if they want or need to in times of general scarcity.

Disregarding all of the above, plenty of meat eaters actually just eat processed garbage most of the time, which is stripped of most nutritional value anyway. If you're concerned about people getting enough nutrients, that's the place to start.

Honestly, vegetarians and vegans manage to live to a ripe old age, often longer than their meat eating friends. There are millions of factors determining age at time of death of course, but you can't seriously sit here and tell us that a plant based diet puts you at a disadvantage compared to meat eaters when all of the evidence and general consensus from dieticians worldwide states the opposite?

You all take such an extreme point of view, what happened to being levelheaded-and not switching between calling rodgers a failure and amazing after every single game. Success doesnt show up immediately, and yes Rodgers invested heavilly this year, but that is both good and bad at the same time.. these guys are young and need to play together.

In terms of Yaya, every year we hear about him leaving over the summer and every year he stays. I would love for Pogba to come and replace him but the issue with that is that we would be fighting all of Europe for his signature. FFP wouldn't be a problem though because iirc the sanctions are already over so we can spend freely this summer.

null,false,miomike,null,null,null,"So, this is going to be a long post, and I'm very annoyed for a number of reasons so I'll see you at the end of it....  

Ok, so I paid £45 for a ticket then, to sit in row A and get rained on and sit in a puddle, so that on it's own is not a good base for everything else.  

First penalty shout in the first 20s or whatever it was - I've looked at the gif - an arm pulls him back a bit and a leg goes across a little bit. It's enough to go down under and also enough to not give a penalty - I'd claim it anyway given half the penalties that get given around, but maybe if he'd been a bit stronger Djuricic would have been in. Hard call, but fine, whatever.  

Coutinho scored a wonder goal. We basically lost to that and a slip up, which sucks balls, because a wonder goal again beat us, and we seem unwilling to shoot but happy to concede these amazing goals - more on that later.  

The second penalty decision, having seen it again, is unbelievable that it wasn't given. What the fucking hell was the ref thinking, there were two tackles there, neither of which got the ball and both got the player?! I was annoyed at the game but it wasn't as clear from where I was in Northam because I just saw a tangle of players. The camera angle shows what an amazing mistake it was - one of the worst calls of the season as far as I'm concerned.  

I'm pretty sure Lovren handballed it in the area - after his yellow and to control it when it bounced around. I haven't seen a replay of that one in particular but from where I was it looked clear as balls that it was a definite penalty in my view, haven't heard much about that one elsewhere.  

Mignolet handballed it outside of the area - it was close but he was - Red card, off we go. Another bad call. So that's what - 4 bad calls already by my count? 4 that could easily have changed the game.  

Now we get to the fun bit. The second half. My fucking god.  

So there's this thing in Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy called a ""Somebody Else's Problem Field"", which I've always remembered and loved. It means you can't see something because your brain just automatically registers it as someone else's problem and you ignore it.  

That is how I feel we regard the following: The goal, the 6 yard box, the penalty area, and **FUCKING SHOOTING**. I mean what the fuck, I swear we fucking passed it around over and across that area as if it was a frozen pond no-one could stand on. And I've seen some shit shots in my life, I've played Sunday League, I've taken them myself. I'd kill to see a shit shot go flying over the bar. I'd kill to see a scuffed shot go out by the corner flag. Because then we'd be **FUCKING SHOOTING**. I don't know we had a clear shot on goal until the 60th minute. Couple of scraped along the floor or tame headers, but until Tadic took that freekick (and the one before it where Schneiderlin just hit it straight out is incredible... I mean seriously), we hadn't had a shot as far as I'm aware.  

By the second half my legs couldn't have got wetter if I'd dumped them in a swimming pool. The puddle I was sitting in meant it felt like I was going through an enema, and my coat (that wasn't properly waterproof) funneled water directly to my crotch, a sensation I've not felt since I so small I can't remember it.  

And even that was possibly a better feeling than watching us fail, so epicly, to look like an attacking force. I'm not blaming any one player, but our tactic of whacking it to Pelle and hoping he can flick it through to an on-rushing winger isn't working, has been figured out, and is down right unimaginative anyway. Our crossing seems to have fallen into a category reserved for ""switch play to the other side of the pitch"", we don't just get down a wing and put a cross in anymore, it's either smashed across the pitch to the other wing, or played across the 18 yard line until it reaches the other wing that way.  

The ref may have fucked up big time in the game (in fact that was the worst refereeing performance I've ever seen personally, and one of the worst I've heard of in the PL - possibly joint with the Burnley v Chelsea game this week), but we absolutely, 100%, failed to create anything that looked threatening on it's own. We couldn't take a long range shot and force a save, couldn't thread a ball through the defence, couldn't put a cross into the box. We had a couple of runs, that could have ended in penalties, or shots that got saved, or even goals, but nothing beyond those - and that's about the 4th game in a row. Even the Palace game where we scored 2 we barely created anything. For the first time, I don't think we stand a chance of getting into Europe this season. We're only 2 points off 3rd, but unless something changes, something drastic, a tactic, a player, an idea, self belief, I don't give a flying monkey fuck, unless something sparks soon, we're going to drop down the table to see Villa, and have a no-goal-scoring party.

null,false,littleblueengine,null,null,null,"1. If you're in the US military then for the love of all things do not tell the rental firm your rank. You see around here Mildenhall and Lakenheath provide lots of US service personnel who want to live off base. The military pay X amount for each rank, and that information is known to the rental agencies. Therefore when they're gathering information they'll ask you for your rank and the rental price will change to be 100% of whatever the military pays. As I understand it, this doesn't actually affect you directly because you don't get the difference if the place is rented for less, I just think that's a crappy way to treat people. Beatrice Carter told me that they deal ""exclusively"" with US military personnel in this area and on the first showing asked this. When I said I wasn't in the military they got pretty cagey about it. Still they also wanted a 3 year lease signed up front, so I didn't move in.

You'll also find odd stuff like them asking if you're in the military because then they'll show you places without white goods (fridge, dish washer, washing machine, etc.) because the bases supply that stuff. Its strange to walk into a place with huge gaps in the wall. If you're not, like me, then that is really not much use. Fortunately my landlady provides all of that even though she is also from the US :-)

You'll find US accents all over around here. In Cambridge itself I've found the biggest concentration in Cherry Hinton, but I don't know if that's because its a posh area or just coincidence. There are places in the heart of Cambridge itself, but I'm not familiar enough as I went to the surrounding villages.

2. I don't recommend an SUV, especially in the heart of Cambridge. Cars here are simply smaller and SUV's are much less common. The upshot being that whilst the roads are wide enough, I suspect that you'll have problems fitting into most of the parking spaces (without a lot of care). If you're in Cambridge itself then I assume that parking will be an issue because they have houses in much of the city, there aren't flats or condos and very few places have dedicated parking. This area is very bike friendly. Not that you don't need a car, but I suspect my Elantra would have been like driving a floating boat.

As far as gas prices go that depends on your car. Fuel efficiency is miles ahead of the US, but right now gas prices are much lower than they have been. Right now they're about £1.10/litre  = 0.25US gallon = $1.70 so x4 = $6.80/gallon.. and that's with the current prices.... I really don't recommend the SUV :-)

3. It is possible that this area will accept US certifications because of the number of Americans in the area. My guess (and it is only that) is that it won't be valid here. At the very least she will probably need to get them validated as equivalent to UK medical certificates, but that is an area that is very specialized, so she should start asking around. She could try asking on http://uk-yankee.com/

4. Honestly I've found it hard, but then I'm older and have a family. It isn't that people are unfriendly, it is just hard finding people that share something with you - most of my neighbours are lovely, but at least 20 years old than me.

With that said though, there are tonnes of walking and biking places around here, so I am sure that there are groups to join. Water stuff is mostly rowing on the river Cam, but if you go further afield you can find sailing, Grafton water, and probably along the coast, and definitely on the Norfolk broads, (but that's pretty sedate). There is a /r/cambridge meet-up - see the side bar, but I'm too busy/scaredy cat to go :-)

5. Actually we moved AT&amp;T -&gt; T-Mobile and still use that. They include international calls, messaging and data in the plan and don't charge extra. The only issue I've had is that periodically they text me to say that I've gone over my data limit and slowed me down - actually what they said is that if I want a faster speed then I should change my plan, but there isn't a problem with the speed.

Leave changing your cell phone until you get here because you can often bundle it with your cable provider, if you get one, Virgin Media or BT and if you need a number right away then you can pick up sim cards really cheaply. It isn't illegal to unlock a phone here (or there any more?) but have Vzn unlock it before you leave, just to be sure.

Other stuff... make sure you get an international driver's license before you leave. Go to AAA and get one (I think it was $29.99 each?) as close as possible to leaving. You have 1 year to drive on a US license, so apply for a UK provisional license and take the test etc. as soon as possible. For the record your many years of safe driving in the US doesn't transfer here.

Gah can't even remember all of the nonsense that we had to deal with, but will try and help with questions that you might have. Came back over in July, so mostly settled now. Oh I know, don't try and bring your bed, or really couch either. If you have an 'murican King size bed then it will almost certainly consume an entire UK bedroom by itself! Alas, but now we can live with much less consumerism crap :-)

Correct, 8th is higher than any of us thought we would be, but it's also lower than we easily **could** be. You said yourself we should have won both of those games, and we absolutely would have if Allardici didn't insist on reverting to the same moronic tactics every time we have a lead. The man has a horrible habit of attempting to fix things that aren't broken. No other team in the league does this so consistently even though it fails us almost every time. Leading with 20 minutes left to play? Better sub off our best forwards, stick Jarvis on, switch up the formation, replace whoever's looking a bit tired with Collins, stick everyone behind the ball for 20+ minutes, put every West Ham fan worldwide on the verge of heart failure and finally hope we scrape the win by the skin of our teeth. I watched the Liverpool v Southampton game after ours and can you guess what Liverpool did after going 2-0 up 70 odd minutes in? Stuck their whole team behind the ball and desperately tried to defend the lead? No, they continued playing the way they had the previous 70 minutes, held their 2 goal lead and left St Mary's with 3 points. 

This ""Hey, we're West ham, it could be worse"" attitude is ridiculous. We've been relegated a number of times in the past, so if we were to remain in the top flight until the day you die, but finish 17th every season, you'd be happy with that? I mean, it could be worse! David Sullivan has said a lot recently about his desire to turn the club into one of the big boys, but apparently people like yourself will be content with us forever being a lower-mid table ""At least we didn't get relegated this season!"" team. 

Of course I don't expect us to win every week, but it's getting to the point where I'd rather we just lost these games by 2 or 3 instead of taking a lead then inevitably fucking it up by playing stupidly.

You raise an interesting subject for review, but the above seems to me to be a case of blaming others/bogeyman for our own failings?

&gt;*So I ask what is your thoughts on the future of democracy in the UK does the definition of democracy need to change?*

Yes. You might find it interesting that our ""Represenational Democracy"" is neither very represenative nor very democratic. A bit like [The Laughing Cavalier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughing_Cavalier), who is neither laughing nor a Cavalier!

In contrast, [The Harrogate Agenda](http://harrogateagenda.org.uk/)

&gt;*The premise on which our movement is based is that democracy means ""people power"". The word democracy stems from the Greek word, dēmokratía, comprising two parts: dêmos ""people"" and kratos ""power"". Without a demos, there is no democracy. But people without power is not democracy either.*

&gt;*Our current system of government is known as ""representative democracy"". That phrase is a misuse of the word democracy. People do not hold power: that system cannot by definition be a democracy. We seek to return power to the people. We are concerned with power – who holds it and under what circumstances and controls, and how to get more of it. Above all else, we hold to the core principle that in a true democracy the people must hold the power.*

&gt;*Our objective is to recover power. Our focus is on the acquisition of power. And once we ourselves, the people, hold the power, we can then attend to the many problems and injustices that plague modern society. But without power, there is only protest – and we achieve nothing of any lasting value. To help us acquire power, we are adopting the original strategy of the Chartists. Like them, we felt it was vital to frame a very limited number of achievable demands – six in number. These are listed below*

&gt;*Or is it us who has to change?*

Yes. We must be the agents of change.

&gt;* It has left me with an overwhelming feeling that democracy in the West is failing. That we have failed to follow the very principles of democracy that we have tried to preach to the rest of the world.*

Some examples in case change sounds far-off and not ""now"":-

1. **Sovereignty** - [FCO 30/1048 - Sovereignty and the European Communities](http://www.eureferendum.com/fcosovereignty2.pdf)
2. **Democracy** - [Goldsmith on setting up Referendum Party](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27056002)
3. **Prosperity** - [It's Not That the Euro Will Fail, It's That It Should Fail](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/05/09/its-not-that-the-euro-will-fail-its-that-it-should-fail/)
4. **Brexit** - [Flexcit: The definitive EU exit plan for Britain](http://www.eureferendum.com/documents/BrexitPamphlet001.pdf)

I suspect the events in the eurozone, the mass migration poor EU policy across Europe and the events in Ukraine (all after the UK's Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria poor foreign policies) as well as advances in the availability of information are all contributing to a building of awareness of a need for change.

Even the media is going in this direction:-

We had mcmanaman, fowler and Owen the decade before that. The current crop may produce a few more; ibe, Wilson, rossiter and such but they are by no means guaranteed to succeed. 

So we may be looking at an average of between 3 to 5 academy graduates who really make an impact on the first team per decade.

Whereas purchases in the last decade include the likes of torres, alonso, garcia, reina, Suarez who were  massive fan favourites and largely considered successes. Sturridge, coutinho, possibly markovic and moreno look like they could be added to that list for this next decade.

I guess what I'm trying to say, in a round about way, is that we buy just as much success, if not more, than we produce. So let's not kid ourselves that Liverpool operates in any dramatically different fashion to any other team in the league.

Sorry but I can't agree with you. We were OK in fits and starts, but Southampton were a better team than us.

Still lucky to receive the ball from a poor clearance though.

They showed great character and grit to grind that win out and so I'm happy and proud of the team overall, but performance-wise playing to the same quality against the better teams in Europe could easily see Liverpool on the wrong end of a 2-0 result rather than the right end.

With Rodgers we now got a young squad that is playing well, with huge potential and a lot of depth. Thats what i dreamed about when he started. He should be given a at least 2 more year granted there isnt a major collapse and we end up in the lower end of the table and the team isnt playing at all.

Our defensive structure has changed to a back 3/5 and this means that each individual player has far less space to cover. The sheer number at the back means that we can stop most attacks more often than not. 
Before, with 4 at the back, we made erratic decision making due to the middle pair not being coached when to step and when not to. We couldn't react to certain and fairly obvious triggers, EG: Tracking a man running into the box (See Clyne's goal in the first game of the season). From using the back 3/5, the back line can sort itself out (it doesn't require much coaching organisational wise). We're lucky that we have Skrtel in our back as our sweeper, because there are not many players in the premier league who stand up as well as he can when we're up against the wall. Skrtel's weaknesses, which are apparent, are minimized hugely as his sole responsibility is to mop up anything that goes through, IE: He doesn't have to control as much space individually (something which he isn't the greatest at). It also fills Sakho/Can/Lovren with confidence knowing that if they do mess up, Skrtel's right behind them to help out. The outside CB's are great outlets with the ball, rarely making mistakes and the wing backs know that if they mess up, the CB's on the side sort it out. Also, unlike last season, we don't need someone dropping in to CB and thus splitting them apart, because as mentioned before, Sakho and Can are great outlets of the ball and pass confidently into midfield. As a result of this, his job (Lucas/Allen) is far easier covering the space between the midfield 5 and the back 3. Also, as Carragher mentioned on Sky Sports, although teams can exploit the space between the outside CB and the wingbacks, generally Moreno, Markovic and Ibe can hold their own in a 1 v 1 (which Rodgers is big on). Finally, this formation suits Mignolet to a tee, as he no longer has to behave like a sweeper keeper (which Rodgers tried hard on doing) as Skrtel is almost always there. His belief in confidence has grown and as a result was tremendous today.

If we're talking about grand corruption then the Russian who benefited off the fall of communism - a period renowned for being rife with corruption - is probably going to be equally culpable by your logic. How about the seasons Chelsea won? Was Abramovich paying off the refs then and simply stopped? Before City and Chelsea were on the scene it was also United got favourable calls too so are they guilty? So are we saying that all the top clubs are in on this grand conspiracy except City are paying the most? I'm struggling to see any validity in that. Refs are under a ton of pressure, big matches exacerbate that and they make shitty decisions. Just because you've seen pictures of Atkinson in relation to the ball doesn't mean you can account for whether he was concentrating on its exact movement or was thinking about a previous incident, if he blinked at the wrong moment, if his view was quite as perfect as you're assuming (in at least one case he's partially being blocked, in others the call isn't clearcut), whether he felt he had been too lenient for one side and needed to be fair etc. 

It's easy to sit in a bubble and think Chelsea are being fucked but there have been games where points would have been lost if not for a fortunate decision (Cahill's flop handball for instance, Ramires' foul in the box against PSG). You see corruption because you want to, sure it's a possibility but it's only one explanation for an event when there are numerous others which have an equal amount of validity based on available evidence.

Because racial violence or discrimination can only occur if it involves gangs beating up people? We have support groups that cater to different needs of different groups, sometimes they are university or union operated. Just saying ""it's already against the law"" is meaningless.

The point isn't that Hamas wants to destroy Israel, they can't possibly do anything of the sort and pointing at them as if they are remotely important to Israel's future is, simply, incredibly stupid. So stupid that I can only imagine that you are doing it to distract from the reality: as Tzipi Livni has stated, Israel intends to continue with the current status quo where they can simply reject Palestinian offers or make ridiculous demands when they are forced to negotiate - but never negotiate in good faith in any case - until eventually they reach a point where the west bank and Jerusalem have been de facto annexed. An elected Israeli government minister has said that this is what they are doing, and anybody with half a brain can see that she isn't wrong. There is a psychological phenomenon known as ""projection"" where you claim that another party is doing to you what you actually are doing to them. Hamas can't possibly drive the Israelis into the sea... but Israel appears to be doing exactly that to the Palestinians.

&gt; Why would you define yourself as anti-Israel instead of pro-Israeli Left

Because Israel's ridiculous electoral system gives the balance of power to the right wing extremists.

null,false,namesaremptynoise,mccoy,McCoy,null,"Well first there's a pair of elephants we're going to have to acknowledge.

1) Every Doctor has bad episodes.  No matter which one is your favorite, they all have episodes/arcs that were poorly written, had bad supporting actors, and ultimately added nothing to the show's mythos and were, at best, forgotten within hours after watching or, at worst, are reviled years or decades later.  Tennant absolutely had his share.

2) Tennant filled the fandom with squeeing fangirls and fanboys who wanted to have sex with the Doctor.  Some past Doctors were agreed to be fairly attractive(I've heard there were a fair amount of people who were pretty attracted to 3rd) and there have been Doctors who had a certain tension with their Companions(particularly 3 and 4), but The Doctor was never really a good target for sexual/romantic fantasy(that's what characters like Jamie McCrimmon and Jack Harkness were for) until they brought on Tennant and started the Rosemance.  I don't think it's unfair to say a portion of the Tennant and Smith detractors are influenced that way because they got sick of the sheer hordes of people in the fandom running the gamut from ""won't shut up about how hot he is"" to ""creepily obsessed to the point where they hate River Song or the actual actress Alex Kingston because they're jealous""

That being said, I really liked Tennant as a Doctor.  McCoy is still my favorite(though I think Capaldi has a *lot* of potential if the writing staff can get their shit together).  Sure he had his weak episodes and they started overplaying his tortured pathos(just like they overplayed Matt Smith being ""epic""), but the reason why was that he was *good* at it and he brought tragic and tortured elements to the Doctor that enriched the character and suited where he was and what he was going through while still doing a good job of maintaining the wit and underlying heroism that define the character.",null,0,null,1424640814,null,0,false,0,cotrlxw,null,t3_2wsncl,null,t1_cotrlxw,null,t3_2wsncl,null,null,null,1424735685,null,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9,null

null,false,djimonia,lfc99,,null,"Our formation now is a 3-4-3 going forward, a 4-4-2 when defending down one flank (one wingback drops in to a shifted back 4 and the other remains in midfield but tucked in) and when necessary, a 5-3-1-1 when defending a lead late on or when under heavy pressure.   
 
We have the right personnel to run all these now: Ibe is basically a proto-Sterling, fast, great stamina, good on 1-on-1s, can hold the ball and strong in the tackle. Markovic is defensively more suspect, but equally good going forward. Moreno on the other flank is a more natural defender but also benefits from speed and stamina. This means they can run up and down all day, keeping the back 3 protected on the wings, and overlap on the midfield 3 or strikers when they drift out wide (Sturridge does this). This gives us loads of threat on the wings - see how much more often we switch play now and how much space the wing backs have in games as they can afford to hug the touchline. When we pin back the other teams' full backs, we see less crosses: balls down the middle are easier to deal with when you have a back 3.

Sakho and Can are very mobile so they can cover the wingbacks effectively and Skrtel has always been a much better covering defender rather than a front-foot interceptor - if Can or Sakho miss the ball or player, Skrtel will pick it up. Playing Gerrard in the first half of the season didn't offer that protection. 

Lucas coming back into the team also means that Henderson and Coutinho are free to press. I would be surprised if our attacking half interceptions and tackles haven't gone up. That was the hallmark of our 2nd half of last season - we pressed high, won the ball high and made teams play on the back foot, even when they were attacking. When that happen, our defence comes under less pressure.  

Against Southampton today, the pressure was immense but that's why you saw the back 5 for much of the 2nd half, especially when Mane came on and pinned our wingbacks back. When Sturridge came on later, the Southampton back 4 was suddenly on the back foot because they had to mark both Sturridge and Sterling - that killed a lot of their attacking intent and we saw out the game. BR's subs have been inspired these last few weeks. He's really nailed almost all of them. Look at today, we saw Markovic being overwhelmed, Moreno came on. We saw Lallana ragged, Sturridge came on. BR's inexplicable subs and waiting forever seems to be gone for good.  
 
**TL;DR: Formation provides defensive flexibility and cover that 4-3-3 did not (esp with Stevie in the DM role). The right players (in good form) have enabled its most crucial part to work: wing backs both defending and attacking effectively. BR has managed fixtures and match days very well, with the right lineups and the right subs.**

How can you say Hamas is not important to Israel's future? They are one of the two major Palestinian political parties.

What offers for a permanent peace has Hamas made? Was the Camp David plan ridiculous?

&gt;Because Israel's ridiculous electoral system gives the balance of power to the right wing extremists. 

All the more reason why the Israeli left needs our support.

null,false,MICOTINATE,null,null,null,"The shooting is a chronic problem and has been kicking around for a while now. I was at the West Ham game and I couldn't believe how unambitious we were being.

Every player seems to try and wait for the perfect passing/shooting opportunity in the final third and takes 2/3 touches too many. I don't mind too many touches if they're running at a guy taking him on but every time one of our players gets the ball in an attacking position they take several touches *away* from the goal.

I could easily point at Pelle and say he is playing poorly which is partially true. But at the same time the whole team is too timid in attack. Clyne had the beating of Markovic and Can on their left side all first half, but he never took them on he only tested them when the ball was passed behind them for him to chase. It seems like apart from Mané we haven't got anyone willing to try and dribble at a team, we just pass sideways and backwards until eventually lumping one to Pelle.

It's so infuriating but I'm not sure how it can be fixed because it seems to be a mental thing. I would quite like to see Koeman change the formation up a bit though, when we were injury hit earlier in the season we were forced into changing our shape to more of a diamond 4-4-2 and it worked really well.

We need to put Tadic on the left where he was playing his best football, put Elia or someone on the right and try harder to pressure the fullbacks and swing crosses in Pelle can actually attack. At the moment 75% of the passes he receives are a flat long ball from the halfway line forcing him to play the flick on, or chest it down with his back to goal.

The theory to sort out the market you need to put labor costs towards the zero lower bound ( as close to zero as required). This would be easier to show as a graph as most thing in economics, but to clear the labour markets you either increases the supply of jobs through stimulus, reduce the amount of people looking for work, or reduce the amount it cost to hire.

Looking at that we have our big new favorite in business Zero hour contracts, which mean that company can adjust to the demand when it wants.

Another fun thing is workfare, it probably runs down the same sort of vein, but its better for companies because don't have to pay a penny for the work of the ""employee"".  It could also be considered good value for money, from the governments prospective since you are getting useful labor at below the market rate.

Now in my opinion in the next few year this is going to bite the country if this is not sorted out regardless of whether you believe supply causes demand or other wise you still need people to buy stuff. If wages are kept low in the end you might end with economy  staling due to demand side failures. Now this is probably has more variable then i am saying but that would require its own paper.

[Your assessment of the Israeli electoral system is totally wrong.](http://fathomjournal.org/the-accidental-wisdom-of-israels-maligned-electoral-system/) A more majoritarian system would empower the Israeli right. In particular: *The longest-lived minority coalition, from 1993 to 1996, rested on the anomaly of Arab parties remaining outside a government they supported.* Arab parties don't want to participate in formal coalitions because then they get put in the awkward position of being the Israeli government.

Many Israelis would agree with you that Israel is a racist society. As is Britain, the United States, and pretty much every society in the world, and the reality of discrimination pains left Israelis as a failure of the Zionist movement. This doesn't have any bearing on the peace process with the Palestinians, who don't hold Israeli citizenship and who aspire to statehood outside of Israeli society.

~~~

You remind me of myself a few years ago - I was convinced Israel was squarely in the wrong, that the Palestinians were desperate for peace, and that Hamas didn't play an important role. But I didn't know anything about Israel, not really. And I'm not some crazy Likudnik or a religious Zionist or anything - I'd call myself a Dove and I don't expect that to change.

Your argument seems to be an appeal to nightmares.  Yes, racist bigots *could* at any time start committing acts of violence ethnic minority students, but to the best of my knowledge, this is an incredibly rare occurrence and there are already laws against this.  Furthermore, for the most part, those laws are enforced.  

BTW, you see the same sort of thinking on the right. Ethnic minorities and the poor *could* start riots and so, it is argued, we need to provide greater weapons for the police.  

And yes, you can, if you look hard enough find one or two examples of racial violence on campuses.  Similarly, a right winger could probably find one or two occurrences of immigrant students stealing or committing other crimes.  

However, I think it's best to live in the real world.  One where we assess the actual risks calmly rather than run around like headless chickens because of what *could* happen, or because of lurid stories which make the headlines precisely because they're so rare.  There will always be people who want to limit freedoms because of possible threats.  But you can never have total safety and freedom is not something we should lightly give away.

We've been very fortunate that he had stayed fit through most of time as an Evertonian. You would think Martinez would want to bring in a reliable number two. The young lad we have now has barely played any football and he's nearly 25. For all of my years following this club, the only time we've had such poor second choice keepers was the late 80's and early 90's when Kearton and Reeves were the cover for Big Nev. 

Everton have managed to have reliable keepers going back to my absolute earliest memories Dunlop, O'Neill, and Sagar all on the same squad. West was brought in to replace Dunlop when Dunlop was still younger than Howard is now. As consistent as West was, we still managed to have a solid number two in Andy Rankin for a good 7 or so seasons. Davies and Lawson were brought in when West was getting on and they served us well too. Even Big Nev had to compete for his spot with Hodge and Arnold early on.

We need a goalkeeeper with better distribution to fit our system, Howard was just pinging it out and having it come back right at him.

I almost feel that Martinez has instilled such desire to keep the ball in our squad that there's added pressure not to lose it, and that has actually stifled our attackers creativity, knowing they have an easy safety cushion in our defence to pass it back to. I'd like to see a bit more ballsy passing, like Gibbo was doing. 60/70 percent possession means sod all when the opposition gets a goal, or at worst you're walking home with no points. I think we need to find that balance we had last year, that was perfect.

I'm bracing myself for downvotes here, but I think Naismith needs to have some time on the bench or pushed forward to striking role/false 9 role. I don't dislike him, or think he's an awful player but I don't think he's being used properly.

I know he's well loved on this SubReddit, but I don't think his excellent work rate (and I'm not denying that, he's got great desire) should guarantee him a place in the starting 11. He can finish for sure, and that's what he should be doing. Using his movement and getting the ball in the back of the net. His passing and control is atrocious and I think if we looked back at when our attacks have broken down this season you would see Naisy right up there.

Barkley hasn't been much better, I think that central attacking mid position needs more depth.

When I talk about the fear to open up because you don't want to be seen as weak or vulnerable by other men who pressure you to be strong and a 1950s stereotype, they deflect blame onto feminists because they take it personally. MRA's don't care about men; they care about themselves and feeling like a victim. It's not feminists or women who police my clothes and emotions, it's other men. But when I talk about it from my POV they ignore me because I'm making men look bad instead of blaming it on women.

When I bring up my issues as a gay man, or don't blame everything on feminists like they do and acknowledge it's primarily other men creating the environment that holds us down they shit all over me and don't respect my point of view and call me a self hating man just because I don't share they views. 

They don't respect my POV as a depressed male who has suffered suicidal thoughts for over a decade when they say they care about me, so I don't respect them either because they don't help me or respect my point of view. 

They only care about feeling like a victim, they don't do anything to help me or other men. They don't help with my depression or suicidal thoughts, they don't help with breaking down the gender roles which make me fear opening up. 

They only reinforce them for their own self indulgent pity party and shit on me because I don't blame all my problem on feminists and acknowledge it's primarily other men who police me and make me feel like I can't open up or look vulnerable or human and have to be a Hollywood caricature to be a real man 

When MRA's actually start doing what they're supposed to I'll be on board, but they're not helping me right now.

Laws on incitement of violence have been replaced by the encouraging or assisting crime clause of the Serious Crime Act 2007, which as you can guess, is to do with serious crimes. If you meant that no one is physically damaged by the act of speaking, of course not, but legally it comes under violent offences.

&gt;Your argument seems to be an appeal to nightmares. 

Your argument seems to suggest that as long no one is physically hurt, there shouldn't be any reason for anyone that might feel trepidation or disconnection that they might rather seek help and guidance from like-minded or similar people. 

&gt;However, I think it's best to live in the real world. One where we assess the actual risks calmly rather than run around like headless chickens because of what could happen, or because of lurid stories which make the headlines precisely because they're so rare. 

If you wish to contest any, please be my guess. You could [start with this for example](http://www.nus.org.uk/en/news/hidden-marks-a-study-of-women-students-experiences-of-harassment-stalking-violence-and-sexual-assault/).

The point is, no, not all societies or group should have to invite any sort of debate of criticism. If you don't like chess, you still should very much be able to join, but don't be a complete cunt about it and claim you're just exercising free-speech. 

I'll be honest, it seems you're guided by this idea that universities should be a place where all ideas should be held by a tribunal of arguments and debates.

If something doesn't work in a small number of games then it's never going to work and any further perserveance with it is just Rodgers being rigid and being inflexible. It's a similar thing if Rodgers doesn't drop a player that's underperformed for three games or pick a player in the starting eleven because he had a good 15 minute cameo the last match. 

There's little patience for the fact that sometimes things don't immediately click on the pitch, but that doesn't mean they're not going to work. Similarly maybe Rodgers is seeing things in training we don't see in the games that may be influencing his decisions.

This is partly the reason I find the line that Rodgers was inflexible earlier in the season to be infuriating. No he wasn't. He was constantly making small changes, and he kept with players like Lovren because he wanted to give them a chance to assimilate. It's not that he's blind to what's happening on the field.

Prescription topicals are effective and can be fairly gentle - I rate azelaic acid and nicotinamide AKA niacinamide both of which have anti inflammatory properties. They might otherwise offer a retinoid which is more potent/ irritating at first but also very effective.

Wipes are not really a cleanser, the first thing I would do is introduce an effective but gentle cleanser - do check out the mega review thread linked to in the sidebar. There is no one type of cleanser for a given skin type, there is an element of personal variance and taste, some with oily skin prefer foaming products others do well with oils (has emulsifiers which means they rinse clean with water, they should not leave you more oily!). Skin types are included in the reviews tho. Do stick with something gentle - nothing alkaline, no anionic surfactants - irritating the skin could increase sebum production as the skin tries to protect itself.

Second thing as we come into spring would be sunscreen: if you choose a physical one based on on zinc oxide this is also anti bacterial and soothing/ calming so work double duty for you, some also moisturise or are mattifying so almost a three in one. I am the wrong person to recommend anything but we will be doing a sunscreen mega review thread soon so watch out for that.

Once you have a cleanser and moisturiser/ sunscreen in place your third product would be a treatment one, instead of or as well as anything your doctor prescribes. Excellent actives for overly oily skin include niacinamide (vitamin B3) and green tea extract, for breakouts those two and/ or sodium ascorbyl phosphate (vit C) and/ or a retinoid (vit A). As you can see this overlaps with what your doctor might prescribe, so it would be best to consult them first.

Don't panic if you don't understand all the chemical names - see the mega review threads in the sidebar and our ingredients Wiki. TBH the best formulated/ best priced treatment products are online, a lot of things in store have one decent ingredient or only a very low percentage. The Wiki has a mix of online and in store products, with percentages where they are available.

Do also review your diet and lifestyle choices ensuring you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle. This may help balance hormones, help 'sweep' waste hormones out of the body, help reduce inflammation that is part of acne.

I wanted him to change his 433 formation, it made us boring, slow and predictable.

I wanted him to push Sterling upfront, we were missing Sturridge so badly and he was our most Sturridge-like option.

I wanted him to drop Lovren, Gerrard, and Johnson. And I wanted him to play Sakho, Can, Borini and Markovic.

All of the above were obvious changes that he resisted making for too long. Granted he didn't play Borini much, and I never envisaged Markovic playing at wingback.

The 343 has been a revelation, and Mignolet's transformation has been remarkable. Rodgers' game management and substitutions have also been much better recently.

Credit to him for realising what was so obviously wrong and changing it, more credit to him for the much less obvious solutions he's found.

Yeah, I'm not going to get into a debate about sexual violence levels at this time of night.  It's an incredibly politicized area and I find it genuinely hard to find reliable statistics for the UK.  It's also highly dependent on methodological particulars, about what the definition of sexual violence is. 

OK, I will ask one question. Is there any evidence to think that sexual violence rates are higher on campus than off?  The last I read from studies in the US was that women are actually considerably safer at university.

&gt;The point is, no, not all societies or group should have to invite any sort of debate of criticism. If you don't like chess, you still should very much be able to join, but don't be a cunt about it and claim you're just exercising free-speech.

Well, this seems to be a different point to me than your other comments, but I'll answer it all the same. 

Yes, students probably should have the freedom to create little clubs where they get to throw out people who challenge their beliefs.  But I don't think it's a good thing.  And neither do you I'm guessing!  What would your reaction be if e.g. a political student soc started banning e.g. feminists from attending?  I suspect you'd feel outraged and affronted.  

Yes, there are borderline cases where perhaps a troublemaker might make it his/her mission to derail everything that goes on in a society.  But, none of this is an argument for 'safe-spaces', is it?  And none of this is an argument for students who are barring white people from attending their event.  So, what exactly *are* do you want, and why do you think it's relevant to the article we're meant to be discussing?

Assuming it's legitimate, I'd think that there are a lot of things that need to be done before they make any announcements. It would probably need to be verified and restored - let's face it, naked videotapes that were stored in a barn for several years probably aren't going to be in the best of condition, and there's no guarantee as to how much of it would be recoverable.

Besides that, there's probably the requisite bureaucratic channels to go through. The BBC only supposedly received it about three weeks ago, so even in a best case scenario with the tapes it's still reasonable that they haven't said anything officially yet.

That being said, while I'm not holding my breath about it I do hope that it's true. It's definitely going to be exciting to have another lost episode found.

Speech and violence are not the same thing. Speech can be used to incite violence, but it is not in itself a form of violence.

The definition of violence can and does in fact [include intimidation and implied threat](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/violence).

&gt;Yeah, I'm not going to get into a debate about sexual violence levels at this time of night. It's an incredibly politicized area and I find it genuinely hard to find reliable statistics for the UK. It's also highly dependent on methodological particulars, about what the definition of sexual violence is. 

So you do you not agree there is an issue with it at universities in Britain?

&gt;Well, this seems to be a different point to me than your other comments, but I'll answer it all the same. 

Not sure how, because that's exactly what I meant with ""But if you join a chess society and consistently complain you aren't playing Go instead, don't expect to remain a member for long."" I see no contradiction here. 

&gt;Yes, students probably should have the freedom to create little clubs where they get to throw out people who challenge their beliefs. But I don't think it's a good thing. And neither do you I'm guessing! What would your reaction be if e.g. a political student soc started banning e.g. feminists from attending? I suspect you'd feel outraged and affronted. 

If a MRA group wants to get rid of feminists or whatever, let them. You also seem to think I'm arguing from the left or some such, no idea where you get this idea from to be honest. I just see there could be some limited need for ""safe spaces"" or whatever, and I do not deal with absolutes. 

&gt;Yes, there are borderline cases where perhaps a troublemaker might make it his/her mission to derail everything that goes on in a society. But, none of this is an argument for 'safe-spaces', is it? 

A hobbyist or fan group can absolutely be ""safe spaces"" for their chosen interests. Not everyone wants it to be a platform for political divisions or arguments. Support groups shouldn't either. 

&gt; And none of this is an argument for students who are barring white people from attending their event.

Always do shoulder checks before you set off on the motorcycle and/or if you stop and put your foot down. This goes for when you do your mod 2. If you're in slow moving traffic and you put your foot down, always check left and right before you set off again.

Go slow on the slalom and figure of eight, find that perfect biting point where you can just hold it at a steady speed and the manoeuvres will be a doddle. Just take as much room as you'd like, don't try and squish it in as tight as possible. As long as you do it, and show the control, take as much room as you need. Just find the right biting point, with the right throttle amount needed, and just look where you want to go.

The 50km emergency stop and swerve catch a couple people out. For the speed, I was doing roughly 20-22 mph round the bend then when it straightens out for when you go through the speed checkers, just open that throttle up big time, get to 31+ mph then ease of ready for emergency stop. 

Emergency stop is a walk in the park, I was told of horror stories of people locking the back wheel up or doing stoppies on the tarmac lol. 
Basically, the minute you pass the first set of cones for the speed check, ease off the throttle to engine break, then the minute he puts his hand up for the stop, gradually press your front brake in, and progressively increase it. 
Don't consciously press your rear brake as the stopping force of the front will cause you to put just enough pressure on it to slow, but not to lock it up. 

And that's it, remember, the test doesn't finish until you've parked and got off the motorcycle, so remember the checks while doing so and pop the bike in neutral before you get off!",null,0,null,1424645424,null,0,false,0,cotu7ny,null,t3_2wru4r,null,t1_cotu7ny,null,t3_2wru4r,null,null,null,1424743044,null,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null

Moreno and Ibe have adopted the positions well though they are more attacking players and thus make more mistakes than we'd like, I'm not taking anything away from them there, just mentioning that they are certainly weaker defensively.

I don't know if it's down to some confusion, but it seems a bit like having 3 in the middle might take a bit more time to be completely effective since I've noticed that tracking a player who is making a central run can end up with our CB's leaving a lot of space for another attacker, E.G Skrtel and Lovren sometimes end up marking the same man leaving channels for the opposition to exploit. 

Can's ball playing (and certainly Lovren's, tonight) isn't brilliant. Can has the vision to spot great runs and all, but often he misplaces regular and short passes and that's led to a few close calls lately.
Lovren was hoofing it all game tonight and sometimes it was a cheap giveaway, though I understand that the last thing he wants is to be caught out so far back and he'd rather get rid of the ball than give it away to an attacker.

**All things considered** we've come so far since the start of the season. The main issue for us seemed to be the formation and gelling of the team as they got to understand each other's game. Now we seem much more fluid and confident in the way we play and our recent for has definitely shown that. Clean sheets and points in abundance in the future.

Evasion is already a criminal offence.

Submitting an incorrect return *(for any reason, but including)* as a consequence of using an ineffective avoidance scheme is an offence *(civil, not criminal)* under Sch. 24 of the Finance Act 2007.

An inaccuracy in a return caused by a third-party may be an offence committed by that third party under Sch. 24 of the Finance Act 2007. 

The problem with the Sch. 24 penalties is that they're behaviour dependent.  That is, no penalty is charged if the error is Despite Taking Reasonable Care and a different rate is charged if the error is due to Careless, Deliberate behaviour.  Now, you notice that every time a celebrity gets caught they say they made a terrible mistake and they were assured it was all above board?  That's so the can claim the error was Despite Taking Reasonable Care.  Essentially, ""My accountant told me it was all ok and I'm too dumb to know better!""

You might then be thinking that the Sch. 40 penalty should be stapled on the advisor, but that requires that they knew there was an inaccuracy and as long as they can point to Counsel's Opinion or some other advice they too can claim they didn't know it was wrong.  Maybe we could get the Counsel?  Nah, 'fraid not, since you have to intend that the *(specific)* third party gain a tax advantage.

In addition to the above, there're additional rules which charge penalties at a higher rate where evasion involves an offshore element.  And finally HMRC gained some new powers to charge penalties on advisers in respect of dishonest behaviour *(in April last year, I think)*, though that power applies to offences committed **after** those powers kicked in.

As an aside, the current government enacted one of the best measures against tax avoidance I've ever seen.  Under the new rules if you have used an avoidance scheme which is either covered by the Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes rules, or where there is a relevant judgement in place you have to pay the disputed tax up front.  If after investigation and legal proceedings your scheme works, you can have your money back, as opposed to what used to happen where you got to keep the money for years; sometimes over a decade, before having to pay the tax.

Either Alexander hasn't bothered to educate himself on these things, or he knows and he's scoring points, rather than proposing anything useful.

A politician who wanted to do something useful might consider:    
a.  Providing HMRC with adequate funding to add more staff to challenging the unacceptable end of avoidance and evasion.    
b.  A strict liability regime where a penalty applies, regardless of behaviour.  *(Which would stop avoiders avoiding a penalty by claiming they didn't know anything was wrong.)*    
c.  Paying for a massive increase in the number of judges in the Tax Chamber of the Tribunals Service.    
d.  Tightening the way tax legislation is drafted; which would almost certainly require even greater use of the services of the Big Four accountancy firms, since neither Parliament, nor HMRC have the capability to get the job done properly.

Basically  The Intoxicating Substances (Supply) Act 1985 makes it illegal to sell substances to under 18s which might be inhaled to cause intoxication. Then there's local street trading bye laws which will probably make it illegal, and also General Product Safety Regulations 2005 which is to do with selling products which might be dangerous.

Lots of them prefer it as they can go along, spend a little money (a three page book is usually about £3) and have a chat with their friends - very traditional-gender-roles speaking, it was the female equivalent of the gentlemen's pub. 

The variant I'm most familiar with is that they give you a card (or several cards) with random numbers printed on it. The caller then draws the numbers from a rotating bin (often with 'humorous' rhyming jokes along with each number - look up British bingo calls).

In the UK we tend to play '90 bingo' (i.e. bingo with 90 balls). The cards are laid out [like this](http://www.casinoedge.com/images/casino-games/bingo/90-ball-bingo.gif), and people mark the numbers on their cards as they're called out. There are often smaller prizes for a 'line' (vertically - rows - or horizontally - columns - getting all the numbers in a line), two lines or 'corners' (getting the four numbers nearest the corners on your card), and the jackpot is for the full house (getting all fifteen numbers). 

It seems to vary whether it's taken incredibly seriously by the old girls who play it or if they just do it for a laugh.

null,false,Paludosa2,null,null,null,"&gt;  The USA and UK have been and gone too many times and the country is no better off. This is now leading to us the people questioning democracy in the West.

That's more a question of massive failure of Foreign Policy:-

[Come the revolution: This talk of restoring democracy to Iraq is absurd. It never had a democracy. What it does need is a revolution ](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/15/japan.iraq) 2002

&gt;*What is needed in Iraq is a revolution, not a restoration. Because of their own relatively peaceful revolutionary history, Americans are perhaps more sanguine about revolutions than people with bloodier memories. It may be possible for the Iraqis to establish a democracy eventually. But the prospect of a successful revolution led by an American general in a torn middle-eastern country seems remote, to say the least.*

[A Point of View: Democracy and Islamic law](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23810527)

&gt;*To understand what is happening in the Middle East today we must look back to the end of World War I. The Austro-Hungarian Empire had been destroyed, and from the ruins emerged a collection of nation states.

&gt;*These nation states - including Austria, Hungary, Romania and Czechoslovakia - were not arbitrary creations. Their boundaries reflected long-standing divisions of language, religion, culture and ethnicity. And although the whole arrangement collapsed within two decades, this was in part because of the rise of Nazism and communism, both ideologies of conquest.*

&gt;*Today we take the nation states of central Europe for granted. They are settled political entities, each with a government elected by the citizens who live on its soil.*

&gt;**When the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed, so too did the Ottoman Empire, whose territories embraced the whole of the Middle East and North Africa.**

[Foreign policy: unravelling](http://www.eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=85160)

&gt;*However, after our failure in Iraq, and a similar disaster now taking shape in Afghanistan, we really do need to think where we are going with foreign policy. The best place to look is here and, try as I might, I cannot see anything inspiring in there. Page 22, for instance – where our ""priorities"" are set out – is distinctly underwhelming.*

If you check the report, it's already deeply out-of-date (Syria and Ukraine) and hence shows how poor the UK Foreign Policy truly is.

&gt;I do hope these events internationally inspire change/ revolution/ evolution but it has to start at the bottom and spread all the way to the top. That is very difficult when it is no longer the politicians who control the country but the banks.

A good quote I keep repeating because it's succinct and applicable:-

[Chapter 24 — Liberal Leader Mackenzie King Said in 1935](http://www.michaeljournal.org/plenty24.htm)

&gt;*“Once a nation parts with the control of its currency and credit, it matters not who makes that nation's laws. Usury, once in control, will wreck any nation. Until the control of the issue of currency and credit is restored to government and recognized as its most conspicuous and sacred responsibility, all talk of the sovereignty of Parliament and of democracy is idle and futile.”*

Our government has too much power in the hands of too few people. We do all understand the dynamics of power: Pursuing power for the purpose of power leads in direction we've probably been observing too much of assuming *""That's the way the world works""*. It's not the direction we have to go in.

It will affect the quality of players we can bring in. If we get CL football two successive seasons, it makes us look like less of a work-in-progress and more like the resurgent European royalty we aspire to be. Especially if it's at the expense of united.

We have a few positions where we need to bring in first team quality: IMO a dedicated RB and DM. We'll be more likely to get the Sami Khedira-level players if we're in the CL. (As in, we go from ""No chance"" to ""a glimmer of hope""). That would be poaching players that could be going to our rivals and improving them.

Just look at Alexis Sanchez.

null,false,DrBasedGod,lfc99,,null,"Tldr: In order to win the league we must first be consistent cl participants, largely due to the quality of players

I feel like it's an acceptable standard to ask of the club when they themselves have made it a priority. It was always the goal to get champions league football for next season from the owners down to the players.

CL football is really the be all and end all if you want to be considered a top side. You get more money, you get better players, and you kick on. We used to be *the* biggest club in Europe so it really shouldn't be such a big deal to want to be where Arsenal have been at least. I think the owners have said to Brendan ""we want to be the arsenal that wins trophies"" and that's achievable for sure.

If we ever want to win the league again we need access to players who are cl quality. We need to bring in some hot shot players from other countries and maybe even beat out some other clubs for them. I'd like to be the kind of club who could beat out the likes of Dortmund or Roma or Atletico to a signing. The only way you get players of that standard is by demonstrating a secure level of success like arsenal have done. There's no way arsenal is able to sign a player like Alexis if they hadn't come in fourth the last million years. We need to take this approach because there's no way we can outspend Chelsea United or City. We just need to add trophies to that arsenal model and we will get the players.

So I would say this season it's crucial to get fourth. If we don't get fourth we can say goodbye to Pjanic or whoever else people thought we would be signing ",null,0,null,1424650337,null,0,false,0,cotwtd2,null,t3_2wtbis,null,t1_cotwtd2,null,t3_2wtbis,null,null,null,1424744416,null,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7,null

For some examples of where the government has had little power to change the course of events see LIBOR, 2008 financial crisis, current oil prices, GCHQ/NSA, tax evasion by large corporations. In many of these instances clearly illegal activity has occurred but no-one has been prosecuted. The public is often expected to bear the brunt of these dodgy practices (austerity), but nothing about the system has been changed. ""Too big to fail"" completely screws over the average tax payer. And yet the government is vilifying the poorest and most vulnerable of our society. 

If the government had true power (or morals) they would have allowed banks to go out of business for dodgy practices, forced large corporations to pay a decent rate of tax, put some restraint on GCHQ et al. and other measures I can't think of.

Not bad, not great. It's trending the right way. We're in a lot more games than we're not, and we've absolutely proven that we can play with nearly everyone on any given match day.  We need depth, and that's what should be acquired in the summer. With depth, we'll be able to play the diamond with subs instead of switching formations because some players just aren't good enough. Then we hold possession longer in the late end of games, and it's an easy victory where we don't need to park the bus at 75 minutes.

Yeah, that's not a thing. Suarez signed a new contract like 6 months before he left. Just because players are contracted and still have a long time left doesn't mean they won't leave. Technically the club can try to refuse a transfer and force them to stay if there's no release clause, but that usually leads to an ugly standoff if the player wants to leave, and the end result tends to be them leaving anyway. 

&gt; We'll definitely sign a big name player this summer, I can guarantee you that and we'll almost likely spend on another striker this summer. 

Signing a ""big name"" player is extremely difficult without CL. We want CL caliber players, but why would a CL-caliber player voluntarily choose to go to a non-CL club? Especially when we often can't offer as much as a the oil money clubs who buy everyone. To get the best players, we need to be *consistently* in the CL, not occasionally in it. 

&gt;I'm absolutely confident we will place high again in the 2015 - 16 season.

I hope you're right. But keep in mind if we don't get CL, we may well end up in Europa...which as far as I'm concerned is just a waste of time. The very slim chance we'll win and get CL is not worth the mountains of potential injuries risked, and the poorer performances in the PL from tired stars who just got back from a game in Bumfuck, Russia late Thursday night. 

&gt;We've a great chance of silverware this season. Why not take it?

Are the two mutually exclusive? As far as I'm concerned, we should be trying our best to get both.

Getting someone competent who could get the guys work better together could improve them as a defensive unit. Instead what he found out was having 3 cb, 2 of them who are pretty good at passing and having wing backs who almost plays like LM and RM would fit our play style. Then adding a destructor in the midfield in Lucas really did fit our team and did give Mignolet some confidence. Holy shit he was good today.

But if you aren't in the money spending mood, you could delve into that murky realm of fan fiction and fan films. Most aren't great but some are good. 

I would, however, say that the Classic DVDs are more than worth it. Each story is of average movie length, I think anyway, and comes with loads of extras usually so I would say they are generally worth the price.

And the books, oh the books! You can rarely go wrong!
