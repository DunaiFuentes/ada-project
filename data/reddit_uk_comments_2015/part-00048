it's fucking pathetic that in the 21st century a politician can't criticize Israel foreign policy without being harassed from the media and ignorant people pretending to be victims.

Milik is on loan at Ajax and he's looked amazing. If Leverkusen decides that the Pfifer money can just buy a better striker, I don't see why we shouldn't be after him. Likewise, Viktor Fischer would be a great catch (Danish, Ajax product), but the fear is that his injury might not have left him the same player. Like J-Rod, we should wait and see. Or Kishna.

As I have said earlier we've had cavity wall insulation installed at 12 noon a few months ago and they came out shouting at the workers for making noise by drilling holes at the front of the house? *who actually does that?*, how would you feel if your neighbour suddenly comes screaming at the engineer who comes to install your broadband because he's ""making too much noise"" *well what do you bloody expect?*  

He makes renovations around his home and makes the **exact** same level of noise by drilling holes in the wall at 5am which has woken me up many a times and I've not complained once.

Judging from what you've said you seem to think I am the problem because of my apparent inability to understand that excessive noise can affect others (well no shit sherlock) I understand this fully and thankfully my other neighbours are nice and reasonable so i can let them know when they'll be some noise during a specific time frame and that it will stop definitely before nightfall and they are reasonable enough to understand this. With the others however, they are the shout first ask questions later type so reasoning is off the table despite the fact that they do the same so they're essentially hypocrites.

Another way you can watch it is by downloading the Sopcast app (you'll have to get the apk off their website because it's not available on the play store). Once you have it, find a Sopcast link to the match and you're set. 

Finally, there's an app called Mobdro (which you'll have to sideload as well) which hosts various stream of live TV channels including Sky Sports, BT Sport, etc. This is pretty reliable but the quality is shoddy sometimes. Looks fairly decent on mobile though

1b) I've consolidated (most of) my pensions into my latest pension.  Generally speaking, you'll pay a lot less in management fees if you consolidate.  It also gives you a nice big lump sum to look at :-)

Moving the pensions is generally quite simple.  You email/phone your current provider and tell them that's what you want to do.  They send you some forms, you fill them in and send them to your old pension provider.

1c) BUT!  Some pensions have penalties or charges for transferring.  Speak to your old pension providers to get a valuation and see how much (if anything) it will cost you to move them.  I've one pension which will **halve** in value if I move it - so it's staying put!

1d) BUT! Putting all your money in one place can be a bit of a risk.  Go and speak to an IFA and see what the best option is for you.

2) Don't withdraw your pension.  You'll be subject to huge fees and taxes.

3) You can have as many pensions as you like.  The only real downside is getting multiple statements and trying not to lose track of them.

It seems to happen every time I remove the PC from power. One caveat being that when I did RMA the PSU, I brought it to work to test a few things &amp; rebuild. When that didn't work, I sent out the PSU and received that at work. I first tested it outside the case - worked fine, so unplugged it and screwed it in, worked again. Took it home and still worked. Maybe it's a problem with dirty power in my house or something when unplugging from my house.

Will do everything in my power to avoid buying a second PSU until it's too late - would hate to buy a new one and find out I get the same issue.

The clutch should only generally be needed if you are going very slowly [i.e. in first gear][caveats apply, this is not a 100% hard and fast rule], for others, the power should be at the wheel at all times, and you roll on a bit of throttle as you go round the bend.

I am from a Labour voting, left-wing family, and socioeconomically speaking I'm part of Scottish Labour's traditional voter base. Let me walk you through why I, and hundreds of thousands of Scots like me, happily give our vote to the SNP instead of Scottish Labour.

1) Political leaning. Scottish Labour have followed the UK Labour party in their drift towards the centre. The rest of the UK electorate have more or less gone with that, but Scotland has stayed maintained its position on the left. The SNP have capitalised on that drift by having strong, socially-rooted policy decisions. They object to several things the Labour party are in favour of; Trident's renewal being the hot button at the moment.

2) Focus on Scotland. Scottish Labour, regardless of what Murph says, are inextricably tied to Westminster. No better proof of this can be seen than in the recent voting around fracking- [Margaret Curran lied about how she voted!](http://wingsoverscotland.com/a-generous-assessment/#more-66093) The SNP, on the other hand, have a fantastic track record since 2007 of looking out for Scotland and her interests. It really helps not to have ~~interference~~ a guiding hand from London.

3) ""The Red Tories"". That's the name I'm hearing the Labour party called by more and more often since the referendum. The Tories are utterly toxic in Scotland, and by standing side-by-side with them in favour of the union, Labour have poisoned the well. Alastair Darling has stood down, and I strongly suspect it has more than a little to do with his concern about what standing arm-in-arm with David Cameron back in September will have done to his reputation.

4) Leadership. The last person in charge of SLab that could be said to be a strong leader was Jack McConnell- now kicked upstairs, something I'm not alone in feeling he should have turned down. If you ask the average Scot to name the three leaders subsequently, most won't be able to. They've been worse than bad; they've been ineffective, weak, and incompetent. Jim Murphy is trying desperately to change that. [Unfortunately, his reputation as a bully has preceded his rise to power.](http://order-order.com/2014/02/26/jim-murphy-to-pete-wishart-fk-off-fk-off-fk-off/) I also see him as [too right-wing to adequately represent Scotland](http://www.indymediascotland.org/node/18398).

Walker - Vertonghen - Fazio - rose 

Bentaleb - Mason 

Chadli - Dembele - Eriksen 

Kane 

I think Dembele has played well recently particularly going forward, when he doesn't have the responsibility to distribute and drive the team forward. With Bentaleb and Mason behind him there are 2 players who can distribute the ball efficiently (Bentaleb), will run and press all day (Mason) and that will shield the defence. Which allows Dembele to focus his considerable abilities on Coqelin and the Scum defence. This will create space for Eriksen to do his thing as well as, Chadli to do his his shadow runs, as well as create a different type of threat going forward. 

Furthermore when defending it gives a not inconsiderable player to add to our efforts. 

I worry about rose, especially how he will handle Sanchez (I don't for a second believe he is injured).

I humoured them and picked my wife's Windows laptop to do it, despite pointing out that every device in the house lost connection at the same time (Android tablet &amp; phones, my Linux laptops, Freesat box, Xbox). I was given several promises of call backs with updates which never happened.

I also work in the sector and have been saying for some time now that the Conservative approach has been fairly drastic and has certainly cost a great deal at a time when the NHS really didn't have a great deal to spend. What is left of the NHS is now paper thin in some places and, as the recent A&amp;E crisis has shown, won't take much to bust open.

Having said that, I'm really not convinced that Labours ""throw a little bit of cash at it!"" approach is destined to succeed either. They don't really have any cohesive NHS strategy in the way the conservatives do... for example at some stage there now probably needs to be a route and branch review of the way the NHS is paid for with several possible outcomes like;

* A shift in the funding model where some services are charged (like urgent same-day GP and A&amp;E appointments).

* A shift in the way we already pay for services, for example with a tiered contribution where young adults contribute relatively little (since they cost very little) to where older working adults contribute significantly larger amounts .

Well that will no doubt lead to some people avoiding seeing their GP, or going to A&amp;E - which will kill people.  So I'm not convinced your ideas are any better than Labour's.  In fact that one in particular is far worse than anything they've said.

Also, a reminder, the Conservatives haven't just been incompetent but actively malicious - we're constantly haemmoraging funding - Monitor recently announced a 1.5% cut to the mental health budget for this coming financial year.  This is an area in crisis already; largely because of funding cuts, and I'm deeply worried about what's gonna happen next.  We've already lost beds, entire wards - suicidal people turned away because there are no beds who have then gone home and killed themselves.  Imagine throwing a charge to go to A&amp;E to tell them you're suicidal into that mix.

Excerpt: 

""A [study undertaken by the University of Edinburgh Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.24158/abstract) studied 853 participants who underwent intelligence testing in 1947 and were re-tested between 2008 and 20104. It found that those who spoke two or more languages had significantly better cognitive abilities than might have been predicted from their original test. The strongest effects showed up in general intelligence and reading abilities, and positive effects occurred in both participants who learned a second language earlier in life and those who acquired it later in life. So it’s never too late to start learning.""

I'm 37 and learning Finnish, which is vastly unlike French (which I learned at school/uni), German (which I did a couple of years of at school), Italian or Spanish (which I took GCSE night classes in as an adult).  It's more challenging but entirely possible. 

Which language to choose, and the reasons for it, are personal decisions, and I included some of the sites and technologies that allow you to part/temporarily immerse yourself in a language with native speakers and real-world resources from home, in the article.

The 5 year horizon is made up, and it's because the stock market generally has an upward trend (especially if you invest regularly so you buy more when they go down, called dollar cost averaging), but over the short term it's not unheard of for you to be 20-30% down. You only really lose when you sell (and also you only win when you sell, which would have been good advice for the millionaires in 1999), so put money in there you won't need for 5 years, and the chance that you'd have to sell at a loss is reduced. It's nothing to do with fees (although they do eat into your returns so the more you sell the less they affect you).  

As for not being in a position for having money you can lock away for 5 years, it's not necessarily worth losing out on the returns unless you really aren't able to. What are the chances that you'll need *all* of it back without any notice? If you had notice, could you not save/leverage credit/delay if your stocks happened to be down? I'm about to pay a house deposit, and the majority of the cash has been in stocks. Worst case scenario? I have to wait a while or even start again. Best case? I have a better deposit. But everyone has their own risk tolerance.

The advice is generally keep whatever you expect to need in the short term in a risk-free liquid account (liquid means easily accessible, you don't have to wait a week for someone to sell and transfer to you), current accounts can give you 3-5% on this ""emergency fund"". The rest, in my opinion if you're young, should be in stocks in an ISA.  

As for enjoying it, this is on you. I'm saving to buy my freedom so I can enjoy the time, but I think as long as you aren't enjoying the money before you earn it, you're on the right track.

Aguero was never near being offside, but if you mean Silva it was all because of Cortuois. He should have punched it out, but didn't and left the goal exposed. So Ivanovic had to stand on the line.

&gt; He tries to dribble out of defence and gets caught now forwards have worked it out.

I think the positives of having him up there are bigger than the negatives when he occasionally loses it. And if we replace him with Dave and Luis, they are gonna go foward a lot more, and get caught more often

&gt;Tottenham worked out he was the weak link and Chadli tore us apart. Chadli!

Though he didn't look good it was also down to Cahill's bad spell. And Matic being poor at covering our defence

&gt;His crossing is patchy at best.

Well who does he have crossing to? It's not like Costa can get a header away against any PL defence anyway

There was also a British-Chinese girl applying for the RAF as an engineer, a black (African I think) going for logistics and an Afro-Caribbean going for air traffic control.

So out of the ~50 people I've seen also applying there's been four non-white British/Irish. Interestingly for me though is that there were more minorities interested in the RAF than the Army. I read a report about the Armed forces demographics and the Army had ~10% minority officers to the RAF's 3%! The opposite of my anecdotal evidence. 

Personally, it's about interest and commitment over active recruitment. For one, if you're talented and black or asian there will be jobs available that pay better, are less restrictive and you'll be able to live in communities of at least ~30% the same race. If the armed forces were absolutely representative you'd still be a minority pretty much every waking second; there's no sorting out into different communities like in London. So I can only applaud the ones who do voluntarily apply but they'd best pass the same objective standards everyone else has to pass.

That's how I think we'll line up. Personally I'd like to see Dembele maybe take Stambouli or Masons spot, move Eriksen to the number ten and put Townsend or Lamela on the right. I also have an unfair bias against Rose which I'm overcoming one good performance at a time. I'd like to see Davies but since Walcott is most likely starting on their right side I think Rose (on his good day) could better cope with Walcotts speed. 

I'm gunna say 3-2 Tottenham coming back from a 2-1 deficit. 1-1 at half. Kane, Dembele and Chadli bag the goals.

The reason for this is that the interest of the mortgage of a rental property can be offset against your income so that you have as small amount of tax to pay.

As you are working a well paid job at the same time which is well over the tax free threshold you want to minimize the 'profit' on your properties as otherwise you'll be losing 20% of profit to the tax man.

Many landlords simply seek to cover the cost of the mortgage and repairs on the property so essentially they have plenty of equity in the house.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"&gt; Well that will no doubt lead to some people avoiding seeing their GP, or going to A&amp;E - which will kill people.

That doesn't necessarily play out in the evidence base. For example both France and Germany charge on an appointments basis (its a token amount) and produce better results than the NHS does. Undoubtedly in a system of this size you are going to find anecdotal examples that appear to prove otherwise, but when the data is comprehensible analyzed it doesn't generally play out.

The trouble is the argument in the UK tends to be mired by a perception that all charging at the point of use has to be like the USA, where visiting a GP to get a sticky-plaster can result in a bill that goes into hundreds of dollars... but most other European nations (particularly those of France and Germany that both have better healthcare services than us) use some form of on the door charging. Most people suggest a basic fee of around £15 as a suitable deterrent to time wasters. Departments would also have some discretion is admitting people who they felt were at risk regardless. The fee would likely be waived for anyone (or most people) brought in by ambulance.

What it does do is cut out a lot of the dross that turns up on the doorstep, and if you haven't worked in the NHS you won't appreciate just what a burden well-people visiting services causes. Most A&amp;E departments have a little cohort of around 10-15 people who are in there nearly every single night, and can have had as many as 1500 attendences in as little as 3-4 years, sometimes coming in several times per day even. GP's also suffer from a similar problem where pensioners with little else to do attend about the most banal of non-problems.

&gt; Imagine throwing a charge to go to A&amp;E to tell them you're suicidal into that mix.

The NHS will be the first person to tell you that coming to A&amp;E because you are feeling suicidal isn't the best option. A&amp;E is appropriate after someone has tried to kill themselves, particularly if they have taken an overdose of something... however the preferred solution is that these people would be better managed in the community under what are usually called mental health crisis teams. The irony is, certainly in the area I work, when suicidal people turn up at A&amp;E they usually just get parked in a corner overnight to wait for the crisis team to pick them up in the morning. The problems with mental health provision in the NHS have more to do with mental heath services than charging for A&amp;E or GPs and to compound the two is to misunderstand how these conditions are best treated.

* People are living longer... but they are also living longer with conditions that would, even 10-15 years ago, have killed them.

* As a result, we are now dealing with people that have complications of conditions in an advanced stage. For example people who had bowel cancer and survived... but now have a stoma and part of their bowel removed, and lots of problems like recurrent [small bowel obstruction or ileus](http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/intestinal-obstruction-and-ileus) etc. They tend to get admitted to hospital for lengthy periods of time and often need packages of care in the community when they are discharged with lengthy recovery times (both in and out of hospital). 

* Drugs have become more expensive and more specific. There are now a myriad of drugs that cost vast amounts of money and often have limited, but never the less some small proven benefit. Judging when and how to use these is a challenge in itself, and the service can't afford simply to opt for them all just because they have some tiny proven benefit (i.e. breast cancer drugs that extend lifespan by tiny amounts like ""up to"" 6 weeks.

When I was younger, 21 = DAS = Fast bike.  We weren't ready for it.  I threw a bike down the motorway about three months after my test.

Whilst I agree graduated licensing or power to weight restrictions (and harder tests) should exist for car drivers too, I think it's the accessibility of power in a bike that scares policymakers.  For example, my first CAR had 50bhp (and was quite quick in my 17 year old brain).  Scale that power up to bhp/ton and it's not much.  A 150bhp bike is easily at hypercar power to weight ratios, and the fact is that someone with a maximum of 5 or so years roadcraft experience in a car (for the normal person, at least) and a training course on a bike (or a couple of years on a 125) is too inexperienced to handle that.

What's the answer?  I don't know.  I feel for you.  I'd hate being restricted almost as much as I'd hate waiting two weeks for my new bike, but given you don't know anything else, it might be OK.  It'll be quicker than most things on 4 wheels, even restricted.

Go steady, do the training, RIDE YOUR RIDE (i.e. don't play keeping up with other riders).  You'll be fine.

null,false,Daigeil,UnionFlag,CBR125R - Matlock Bath,null,"Yeah, it's definitely a problem of accessibility. I take particular issue with it because it ends up meaning the extremely wealthy get a different set of laws. Most 18-year-olds can't afford a very powerful car - so you don't see them on the roads, so they don't get legislated against. 18-year-olds *can* afford a very powerful bike, so they're restricted, even though the danger for others is probably greater with the car. The legality of something shouldn't depend on how easy it is to do the thing for the less-wealthy majority.

I think the answer is threefold. Part one, bringing cars and bikes in line legally; give the same incentives to use a bike as you give for low-emissions cars, putting in power-to-weight restrictions on cars for under-21s, requiring the same kind of two-part practical test for cars.

Part two, make age-related laws consistent; if 21 is the age where you're an adult, treat 21-year-olds as adults. If you want to prevent new riders or drivers from getting super-fast vehicles, then apply limitations based on how long they've been riding or driving, not based on them reaching some age boundary.

Part three, get rid of this CBT nonsense and fix training schemes. The number of people who pick up a CBT and a 125 at 17 and then just ride that forever is *ludicrous,* as the CBT is a totally inadequate training scheme. I ended up having two days of training because my instructor is very conscientious - he didn't feel we were ready, so he gave us another day free of charge. Most instructors are not so thoughtful, and those two days were *still* completely inadequate as I ended up coming off because of adverse conditions and my inability to cope with them three weeks later.

I reckon it all comes down to ensuring the legislators actually know things about bikes, which at the moment it seems they don't. Some sort of restriction by age might also be wise, since I could probably (given enough money) get hold of a Vincent Black Shadow and ride *that* legally and it's clearly not bloody safe. 

Anyhoo, I'm past saving :P by the time any sort of change happens, I'll be fully licensed anyway.

2. You've given a textbook example of a bed blocker, this is the result of lack of resources in community care (still NHS), which is putting a further strain on hospital based care. It's an ever downward spiral.

3. That what NICE is for, the NHS already does this and often makes the headlines in the tabloids when a 'life saving drug' is denied to an individual. In fact local authorities allocating their resources based on the demands of their populations rather blindly following national trends is what leads to 'the postcode lottery'. 

I'm not actually sure what your point is with the last one but the first two can be summarised as saying demand for NHS services are growing, that can only be rectified with a adequately funded health service.

null,false,zenmn,null,null,null,"&gt;i am assuming because of my skin colour

&gt;and most importantly if they dont mind dating a brown guy.

Don't assume that. If you start thinking that then you are the one putting a subconscious barrier up against finding someone. I understand that it can't be easy in a 90% white country, especially if you have a foreign accent, but don't use that as an excuse, there are lots of inter-racial couples out there too (I'm in one of them!)

Some advice:

**Stop making excuses as to why women ""don't like"" you.** 

People are indeed fickle creatures, but I guarantee most women don't care about your skin colour. Try asking a few of the thousands of single white men what their opinion is, even they'll tell you it's hard to find a partner. 

Now this isn't to say there aren't people out there who wouldn't date you specifically because of your colour, but they are either racist or just not attracted to you, so either way, you don't want to date a racist or someone who isn't attracted to you, so no need to worry about that.

**Socialise and be confident of your hobbies/interests**

If you like sports, gaming, music, technology etc there are loads of events around to get involved in and meet people. If you don't have a social hobby then try your best to get one. Don't give a shit about it being ""Cool"". If it's something you enjoy, or think you might enjoy then do it.

Now, let's be clear: you mightn't actually meet a girlfriend here or any girls at all in fact, but that isn't the point. The point is for you to make more friends, even if they are male, because the more people you know the more likely they will have a female friend that you will like and it's a fact that couples who met through friends are statistically more probable than couples who were strangers.

If you are someone who is socially anxious, this can be a hard thing to do, which is where dating sites can really pick up the slack. However, stepping out of your comfort zone will only help you. 

What's the worst that can happen? You'll not make new friends........and that's what will already happen anyway.

What's the best? You'll meet new friends with common interests, gain confidence in yourself, you'll meet girls you like either directly or indirectly.

**A few other points...**

&gt; i got girls there had conversation with me but when i asked them out they seemed to ignore me.

Don't ask girls ""out"" that you just met. If you can, get their number/add them as a friend on facebook etc.

Two reasons for this:

1. Asking someone out on a date that you just met in club/pub is pretty much a no-no in this country. It often appears as desperation to the person you are asking.

2. The ""culture/guidelines"" here is to get to know them a little bit bit before you ask them out on a date. Getting their number/facebook means you can talk to them a couple of days later and see if you connect personality wise. This is also ""standard procedure"" in dating in here.

**May I ask?**

Have you tried dating any non-white women? You seem to use your skin colour as the reason that you feel they won't date you, which makes me believe you've only been trying to date white women.

There aren't as many non-caucasian women here (obviously) but there are lots of young women here from different races. 

(Semi-related fact: specifically within your age range was when there was a huge boom of international adoption from India and Sri Lanka over here and in the rest of the UK in the late 80's to early 90's)

Again, if your skin colour is making you unconfident then this could help you and even then you could have interesting points to talk about with that person.

Don't rule anyone out!

I lived in Clifton Village for 2 years or so, and never once was able to park outside my house, and a good proportion of the time I had to park a road over, or even further away just to get somewhere to park. In my new area, I've parked outside my house every day for 2 months, and to be honest I welcome the convenient change!

I do appreciate that getting rid of parking for double yellows is a bad move, we need more space for parking, not less. However I think berating me for not having done my homework may be a little strong. Some areas do have a 2 hours maximum free stay, perhaps Clifton Village is different (I moved literally a week before they started putting down the new marking for RPZs), but my point still stands. Half an hour of free parking in Clifton Village is most likely more than enough to do the bits of shopping you need, and if it isn't then I have to question the need to drive there anyway! 

George Ferguson aside (I'm not entirely sure where I stand on him - e.g. Metrobus seems like a great idea if it wasn't for the fact that allotments are being bought off to make room for it), and owing to the fact that I am allowed my own fairly well informed opinion (having had more experience of RPZs than many) I suggest that RPZs are a good idea in principle, but perhaps somewhat poorly executed in some areas?

And as for neighbours getting at eachother's throats over parking, perhaps they need to be a little more open minded and less militant over what they claim is rightfully their's in some way?

Transfer fee is obviously affordable - City got him for 20 and will sell him for less.

As for wages - I think he'll have to take a pay cut anyway. It's not like rich clubs like Madrid and PSG will run after him. Wherever he goes, like back to Italy, he'll probably have to take a pay cut.

When I was looking last year, I found it very easy to get in contact with the estate agents online via email. From there, I organised viewing dates normally about a week in advance. But if you explain your situation to them I'm sure they will be able to accommodate you.

When it comes to agreeing to rent a property, the estate agents will want you to sign a contract and pay a deposit. But previously, they have been happy to do this via email and post for me. And payments are easily made online via BACS.

You should also know that, while it is technically illegal for estate agents to charge you any extra fees, such as an 'admin fee' or a 'finders fee' many flaunt the rules and often charge a small fee. I've previously chosen to walk away from such agents as I don't trust a place willing to break the law, but that is your own decision. 

I hope that helps. Good luck",null,0,null,1423227249,null,0,false,0,cod0beh,null,t3_2uz28n,null,t1_cod0beh,null,t3_2uz28n,null,null,null,1424128814,null,2,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,2,null

I had a good friend who invited us to his wedding in New York.  Total cost for my wife and I to go was ~£3k.

There are several ways you can look at it - that's the cost of a new car, a few months rent, 10% of a house deposit, etc.  If we hadn't spent the cash, in a few years it would have grown even larger.  Saving the money is the *sensible* choice.  No one *needs* to go to a wedding.

So we packed our bags and flew out to NYC. Why? Because making memories and having fun is worth the temporary pain of setting back your plans by a few months.

Money is a tool.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Set goals for what you want your money to help you do - buy a house, take a nice holiday, provide a safety net, allow you to retire etc.

Then, when circumstances change, change your priorities.  

If stashing all your money away means you're not enjoying yourself, find a way to change that.",null,0,null,1423227653,null,0,false,0,cod0fhs,null,t3_2uz15p,null,t1_cod0fhs,null,t3_2uz15p,null,null,null,1424128705,null,18,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,18,null

In my experience it has been venue/security discretion whether they let you in or not. I've not heard of an instance where hundreds have turned up without cards though - like I say, the touts generally sell tickets to these shows along with a matching credit/debit card. I can imagine it'd become an issue of public safety if the numbers were high enough, they'd probably end up letting them in.

Re your majority comment - I'd say the majority of consumers are against resale. Those who actually own the tickets are probably all for it, since they reap huge profits from the status quo.

For what its worth they like to take you down residential roads (which are likely to be 20s) to see how you react to the new speed limit and different hazards like emerging cars and so on. Usually those roads have the square type speed bumps. This is so that emergency vehicles aren't so affected by the bumps and can travel above the speed limit. They're a good clue. Other things you often find in 20mph limits include other forms of traffic calming, such as priority over oncoming traffic signs with the island in the middle of the road and width restrictors, things like that. If you come up to anything like that, have a good look for any speed limit signs. Although typically the traffic calming measures themselves don't affect M/Cs that much they are there to slow traffic down. In any case it might be advisable to reduce your speed, even if it is a 30.

[Birdman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2562232/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1): Awesome, intense drama about the innerworkings of a Broadway play and a washed up actor trying to rekindle the flame.

[Fury](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2713180/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1): Beautifully shot WWII film that follows a tank crew through hard-hitting battles. Really well done with some insane action.

[John Wick](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2911666/?ref_=nv_sr_1): Pure fucking action. Watch this if you like action films and Keanu going full-Neo

There are generally three arbitrators, especially through the ICSID. One is appointed by the company, one by the government, and the third is decided by both the company and the government. It's important to remember that ISDS cases are not 'court' cases. They're arbitrations. Their goal is to find a reasonable outcome between the two, and failing that, to award compensation to the company *if there has been a breach*. 

&gt;Also if the democratically elected governments wish to change their laws as is their sovereign right how do they re-negotiate the terms of the original ISDS

They're free to change their laws whenever they want. As long as they don't go against TTIP. If they want to change their laws regardless of TTIP, they'll just have to break the treaty.

&gt;The terms of any ISDS surely need to be revisited regularly?

Generally, they are. BIT (bilateral investment treaties) generally expire after a few years if not renewed. I don't know what the terms are going to be in this case, and until the text is revealed, I won't know. But regardless, I don't think this will be on a renewable basis. The whole point of ISDS is to provide stability for investment, and if that stability is timed until the treaty expires, it's kinda pointless. Regardless, the safeguards the EU is putting in place with respect to ISDS that they have informed the public about, seem strong enough to prevent any abuses of the system from corporations.

&gt; the sovereignty of a state to enact it's democratic mandate.

If we hold sovereignty above all else, there is no point in having treaties. Treaties inherently limit what the government can do, for greater benefit for the two parties.

&gt;I was under the impression that in the USA the Supreme Court is supreme? So how does the arbitrator of an ISDS dispute pass judgement onto the American state if it is judged to have acted unfairly? 

ISDS doesn't go through national judicial channels. It's completely separate from national systems, and generally goes under the World Banks ICSID, or the UNs UNCITRAL.

The other conclusion is the face of eternity, life is meaningless. What's the point of the pain and struggle other than as some sort of sorting process (that God knows the outcome of, and also rigged).

Hazard seemed to get a penalty every other game at first. Then they stopped giving it for some reason. I say some reason, the reason is obvious, they think he's diving. 

Clearly the refs have not tried to balance their center of mass running at full speed zig-zagging through 3 opponents. It takes a slight nudge to fuck it up. That is a foul. That is not ""barely touching"", it is actually all that is needed. If the opponent does not take the ball, and he is even grazing the attacker, that is a foul. You can never argue that ""it was barely a foul"", when the ball is not touched. Yet certain pundits seem to think the extent of the contact between players should be considered when giving fouls. Contact is contact, and it is actually not allowed in football (no matter how much people actually want to see broken legs and violence), aside from two players equally chasing the ball.

A) you'll be earning way more - your nominal salary is doubled, but cost of living is *much* lower. On the same token taxes are higher, but you also receive better infrastructure and free healthcare. As an added bonus, if you make the move soon you'll receive a greater amount for any assets you sell off (house, etc) as the USD is fairly strong, while the GBP has been weak compared to historical levels.

B) experience a wholly new culture - the idea of the UK that we get in North America (I'm Canadian) is entirely unlike what it is to experience it. Though the weather is notably worse than what you get in SF, the abundance of history both natural and man-made is astounding (as well the sentiment for preserving and respecting the past is far stronger in the UK and Europe as a whole).

Be open.  Be open about the possible failures (I'm still not employed).  Be open about every worry you can think of.  Be open about the possibilities.  What does she do?  What does she want from life?  Whatever her goals are if they can be satisfied by moving abroad focus on those.  

But you have to be honest about resentment.  It is something that is inevitable now.  If you want to go and can't you have to be ready to handle it.  If it turns into a big fuck up she may resent you.  You have to be ready for that.  

We had resentment in our marriage.  But we always addressed it.  We worked through it and we are better as a couple because of it.  If I could go back in time and change the move I wouldn't.  Not for anything.  It has been really hard but it brought us close and proved we belong together.

null,false,MrPurr,null,null,null,"If I understand correctly, your skin is oily when you do your routine, but combination when you don't. Based on that, and the routine you posted I think you need to make some changes. It is probable that your skin is not actually oily, but in fact severely dehydrated (I recommend you look through all the sidebar links in the main reddit, /r/skincareaddiction).

The skincareaddiction subs generally dont advise using physical exfoliants, i.e. the 'scrubs' with little abrasive particles in them. If you insist on using it (which I don't recommend, at least for a month or so until your skin heals itself), use it once a week at most. I think I used the neutrogena grapefruit *face wash* before my SCA days, and I remember it being quite drying. In summary: Stop using it (for now)

The toner is fine. You can use that after cleansing, or instead of cleansing in the morning (although just washing with water is also fine). The moisturiser should be fine also.

The witch blemish stick contains loads of alcohol (the first ingredient is alcohol denat.) so stop using that. It's a common misconception that blemishes need to be dried out.

Finally, I don't know about the face mask but at least you should only use it once (or maybe twice) a week, but again, maybe not at all until your lipid barrier has been restored!

As we describe later, the ‘sick and disabled’ are increasingly included amongst ‘the undeserving poor’. There was no shortage of disparagement of the allegedly undeserving poor in our interviews, including of those claiming sickness and disability benefits. Carol (44) claimed DLA (Disability Living Allowance) and described how she felt about some others who did the same:

&gt;Yeah, there's lots of people round here … I suppose I shouldn't say this but half of ‘em are on DLA and there's nowt wrong with ‘em! It's because it's not hard for them. Because they're, like, comfortable on what they're getting. They know it's going to be there. People say ‘why should I work if they're going to pay me?’ … Instead of getting a job they think ‘nah, I'll go on the Social and get money for being ill’.

MacDonald and Marsh (2005) heard similar distancing narratives in their research with young adults in the same Teesside neighbourhoods. 

Paradoxically, whilst young adults described graphically their own depressing episodes of worklessness and strong commitment to employment, they were often quick to suppose that others around them were ‘work-shy’ and ‘welfare dependent’. In a concerted test of underclass theory (Murray, 1994), MacDonald and Marsh (2005) actively sought to find these ‘Others’. 

What they gathered in subsequent interviews was not evidence in support of underclass theory, nor that validated earlier interviewees' suspicions, but further accounts which talked about ‘us’ and ‘them’; ‘the deserving’ and ‘the undeserving’. **The ‘workshy underclass’ was a phantom that could not be pinned down in the practice of fieldwork.**

Indeed, across our studies in Teesside one of the most consistent findings has been the strength of employment commitment amongst the sorts of people most likely to fit theories of ‘a welfare dependent underclass’ (Johnston et al., 2000; Webster et al., 2004; MacDonald and Marsh, 2005; Shildrick et al., 2012).2",null,0,null,1423237884,null,0,false,0,cod4ru7,null,t3_2uzg89,null,t1_cod4ru7,null,t3_2uzg89,null,null,null,1424124595,null,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13,null

That said, looking at it pragmatically, if we were to abolish the monarchy we'd be in a very, very awkward constitutional position - to the point where we'd likely have to sit down and start a new constitution from scratch.  That's all well and good one might think, but who's going to do it?

Doesn't say that if you ARE over that limit they will not allow you - in fact it just sounds like it is a limitation of the device that it cannot detect low levels of alcohol; probably because it doesn't require direct contact.

So if I borrow 20% of the house value, I have to pay an EXTRA £20k on the £40k I borrowed AS WELL AS any interest on the equity loan. It will make the government - i.e. the public purse - quite a bit of money I reckon.

You see similar claims from Labourites saying bailing out the banks was a good option because in the long run the government has profited from the part ownership of a bank. And it'sa fair argument because in the long run the return on investment was better than a standard interest rate if not closely the same.

The ""traditional"" answer is that you're aiming for a position of ""financial independence"" - that is, the point at which you stop needing to work for your money.

That point depends on three things - how much you need to live on, how much you save, and what returns you achieve.

Let's say you decide you can live on £15,000 PA when you've paid off your mortgage. This means that you would need roughly £375,000-£400,000 in today's money to retire, assuming withdrawals of 3.5%-4.0% PA.

I'd love to. Please tell me how the CAP royally fucks over Africa, given they reduced export enhancing subsidies from the billions of euros a few years ago, to zero for the current budget period. When almost all of the subsidies fall under the Green and Blue boxes of the WTO (meaning, least, or not at all, trade distorting).

null,false,Suitablystoned,null,null,null,"*So I'm going to start cycling to work for the first time ever and to be honest have no idea what I'm doing, the official information I can find is pretty much ""stay off the path"" so I have a few questions...

Firstly, is it OK to use crossings as a cyclist if I need to turn right across a lane coming the opposite way (as an example) Will it just piss off whoever stops to let me go and encourage them to be dangerous?*

Don't use crossings for this, you should be able to make a right turn if you just use a hand signal, stop slowly and wait until there is a gap.  You're absolutely right it will annoy the road users because you have used a pedestrian crossing to stop traffic for your benefit when (as a cyclist) you are a road user.

*Secondly, other cyclists. I understand there's a bit of hate from those with road bikes and all the gear towards ""casuals"" like me on mountain bike at 10mph. What are the major ""don'ts"" when dealing with other cyclists?* 

This one is easy, most other cyclists will be friendly, i think it is due to the danger for cyclists that there is a certain amount of fraternity between us, however if you see someone coming up on you fast make an effort to tuck in as much as you can to let them pass you.  Also just a side note, if you have a puncture repair kit and a pump (you should always have this) and see someone with a flat stop and assist, spread the love.

*Can I ride on certain paths if they are empty and for example on the side of a dual carriageway, or even on the grass in between the road and the path?*

The best advice i can give here is if you have to use the footpath make sure you give pedestrians the right of way.  It is theirs by right as you are officially a 'road user' when cycling but most won't care if you are polite.  I use the paths sometimes but always be very careful, if you hit a pedestrian they might call the cops or kick your ass.  Where the road is OK / safe to cycle on you should be on the road, also it is way quicker.

*And finally, things to look out for with other drivers, is the most common accident or near miss people not checking their mirrors and turning into you? Any simple way to make sure they are aware of you?*

Plenty of lights and reflective tape is the answer here, you can pick up some 3M style tape for a few quid on eBay to put on the frame and stuff and invest in a set of decent lights.  you should put lights on the front and back of your bike as well as on the back / front of your helmet and on your backpack.  i use the Lezyne Femto Drive lights and whilst they are pretty awful for seeing by, they are bright enough to BE SEEN by and retail for about £20.  Wear some decent reflective clothing or reflective bands.  also stay out of drivers blind spots,keep clear of trucks and buses altogether (they make up 5% of road traffic but are involved in 20% of road accidents), keep an eye out for parked cars,  if occupied the door might open at any time.  Don't rely solely on indicators also keep an eye on road position and speed to give you extra notice someone plans to turn or stop.  make sure your bike is well maintained too.  get cyclists insurance with public liability, i got mine for £5/month from Cycle-guard.  this means if you hit a car or a pedestrian they will pay for the damage minus the excess of £30 and you can avoid the aggro of a pissed of driver who thinks you are trying to wiggle out of coughing up the cash for the damage.

*Edit: should add I live in greater London, so there are some cycle paths but they are badly planned and usually have people walking on them.*

I live in Belfast and whilst it is nowhere near as busy or populous as Lobdob there are far fewer cyclists and drivers don't really look out for you at all, it's on you.  Whilst it is the responsibility of drivers to drive safely ultimately your life is your own responsibility and you should take all possible precautions to avoid becoming a statistic.",null,0,null,1423240570,null,0,false,0,cod6bj5,null,t3_2uzbbl,null,t1_cod6bj5,null,t3_2uzbbl,null,null,null,1424123121,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

First post: Allyson Pollock isn't a suitable source on whether the Tories want to completely privatize the NHS or not.

Second post: Same issue as before. This is not a source on whether the Tories want to completely privatize the NHS or not.

Third post: ""If I was an evil genius that wanted to privatize the NHS in a way the public wouldn't notice, how would I do it?""

Jesus fucking Christ these people aren't even trying to be reasonable. The green party is not a source on the motive of the conservative party, in the same way that the conservative party calling the green party ""Pinko commie stalinists"" doesn't mean the green party wishes to carry out a second holodomor.

Here's the main problem with saying Tories are trying to privatize the entire NHS: In their 5 years in government, something along the lines of 1-2% more of the healthcare budget is now ""Privatized"". No matter how much you try and inflate what this contains, 1-2% in 5 years is a pathetically poor rate. No matter how much you try and portray this as some mustache twirling supervillain plot carried out by evil sentient banker bonuses, it's still 1-2% in 5 years.

null,false,slow_poetry,null,null,null,"In all the matches and videos I've seen of him, I have never thought ""oh, he has something other wingers don't"". I think this, because I have general beliefs as to what makes a great winger a great *winger*. I remember watching someone like Robben, when he was at PSV, and thinking ""this guy obviously has extraordinary control when running at speed, and does so while pretty much solely relying on a cultured left foot"". That was obvious with Robben. Of course now, he is a different player, in that he is far more complete in other departments, and hits the byline less due to the obvious goal-threat he poses *on his own*. Robben is much more than just a winger now. So, when I look at wingers, I look for something even just slightly different. Hell, Adam Johnson has something *slightly* different (a brilliantly deceptive left foot, and excellent balance given his height), he just doesn't have *nearly* enough of everything else (physical presence, work rate, end product, and an appropriate attitude). 

Now, Cuadrado. He is fast, he is fairly nimble, he has decent balance, and he can hit the byline. Moreover, he works hard, and recovers quickly. He is a good player in that he has enough of everything. Maybe he has more than enough. But I think we have paid a lot for a good player (just as we have done in the past), and not necessarily an excellent *winger*. I think this guy will put in shifts very similar to Willian. 

Of course, I would be happy for Cuadrado to prove me completely wrong (as Malouda did for a season, in which he found a way of carving out *just* that something different, by scoring plenty of goals from virtually the same spot in the D).

EDIT: Also, please note, that there is nothing actually that bad about having another Willian. It seems as though Cuadrado will offer slightly better end-product, at the cost of a little defensive acument, in comparison to Willian. We would have, with them on the wings, an extremely hard working pair of wingers, who can, if needed, stretch teams. They will also track back and offer obvious outlets on the counter or in transition simply because of their pace. We should keep in mind that rarely are the best teams, player for player, made up of reliable game-changers. Often, a great team is marked by its ability to offer various kinds of threats beyond individual ability. Players like Willian and Cuadrado are priceless in that respect, because they stick to their function *very very well*. I say he is ""not good enough"", because I have, personally, long hoped for someone left-footed with the slight-of-foot that so captivated me when I was attending the Mourinho Duff-Robben games. To me, that was the paradigm of a team that was significantly built around the wingers. Hence my disappointment.

Doctors have certain symptoms that are red flags which will fast track your diagnosis/assessments. If you had anything like that you would have been seen sooner. 

The other thing is, that you can often feel really unwell, in fact you can feel like you're about to die, but it can still be a non-life threatening or non-serious condition. In addition, problems in the abdominal region are difficult because there are so many organs there. Pain in that area is also really difficult to assess. Usually they do it by ruling out the most dangerous things first... a process of elimination. 

I'm guessing you've already done, this but have you looked up symptoms of ovarian cancer on the NHS website?

http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Cancer-of-the-ovary/Pages/Symptoms.aspx

On the other hand, IBS is usually the diagnosis doctors give when other issues have been ruled out, which it doesn't sound like they have been since you've not had any tests so far? Misdiagnosis can happen. Have you seen a number of different doctors or just one?

You have a few options depending on what you think. It really comes down to your judgement if you don't want to wait that long.

You could go to your local A&amp;E - the downsides are, that it's not for an accident or emergency, so with A&amp;E how it is, you will have to wait for well over 4 hours in the waiting area. You may get unlucky and get someone who is just as unconcerned about it as your doctor was. You could go at a weird time of day when it's likely to be much quieter. Avoid weekends and out of normal work hours. They may well do an x-ray and urine sample, but depending on your symptoms they may be the only tests they do. Whether these are the right things, I don't know. 

Your other option is to have a private assessment. It may be less expensive than you think and you'll certainly not have to wait as long. I had a knee injury years ago, which went on for a decade with problems continuing. Eventually I was assessed privately, then went on the nhs waiting list for the actual operation. Just knowing what it was was the important thing and someone making a proper treatment plan. So this option is definitely worth looking into! You should have some specialists at your local hospital who work part privately and part nhs. So, you might get an assessment privately, then they may do your treatment or follow up stuff on the nhs. 

This might actually be the better option since you're more likely to be looked at thoroughly and it seems just knowing whether it's something to worry about or not is the important thing right now. A specialist would be able to provide reassurance at least, since they will be expert in that area. 

Hope this helps!

Anyway, Grey's most important point in the video is this:

*""If the government stopped paying the royal family's living and state expenses, the royals would be forced to take back the profits from their land, and your taxes, dear monarchy haters, would go up, not down.""*

This point is completely true, there's no denying it. But the video you link scoots around this by claiming:

*""We'd start charging the Royal Family the taxes they are exempt from, more than making up the shortfall.""*

Umm. What? This makes no sense. Of the Royal Family's £200m revenue, the government keeps £160m. The idiot who put this video together honestly believes that the tax on the Royal Family's income would be *over 80%*. Not only is this obviously bullshit, he quickly skims past this issue so as to not give you any time to think about it.

Well actually the drilling is no different. Fracking is a completion method not a drilling technique.

&gt;Thats where the uncertainty comes in, its a new(ish) procedure.

It's in no way new. It's been carried out for over 60 years, and literally millions of wells have been fracked. How many million times does something need to be done before people stop talking about ""uncertainty?""

&gt;My issue is with you implying that theres some kind of test, which I strongly doubt is the case.

Well, there isn't really a test, that's kind of my issue. This ban, meaningless as it is given Wales's lack of basins, is done without any real intention to allow for fracking to ever occur, but the ""until proven safe"" is stuck there to give an air of credibility to what is a hysterical, irrational, and uninformed act.",null,0,null,1423242539,null,0,false,0,cod7hsv,null,t3_2uzbd9,null,t1_cod7hsv,null,t1_cod67a7,null,null,null,1424122000,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

The closest you are going to find to any evidence of fracking contaminating drinking water is cases such as this:

http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/09/15/3567369/fracking-water-contamination-casing/

Now if you read the article, it becomes clear that what has actually happened here is that drinking water for a single or small group of remotely located households has become contaminated because they're using a private well for drinking water, situated close to the fracking site. A few points to make here:

A quick google shows that less than 1% of households obtain their water this way in the UK:
http://dwi.defra.gov.uk/consumers/advice-leaflets/pws.pdf

Very few of this 1% of households are going to be anywhere near a fracking site, maybe only 1/100. For the purposes of argument, we'll instead use 1/10. So at this point we are already looking at a problem that will affect 0.1% of households.

Now consider that this is a problem that is not inherent to the technique, and actually only occurs if the well has not been cemented properly after the steel liner is inserted. Now UK regulations on this are MUCH stricter than the US (source: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/283835/Safety_v3.pdf). But we'll ignore this completely too for the sake of argument.

In the US it seems that about 1/100 wells are not sufficiently sealed, just going from the fact that they have drilled well over 10000 wells and have only had 209 complaints (see article above for source on this). The UK not only has stricter regulation, but also has vast experience in drilling these wells as we have been drilling them since the early 70's, not just on shore but also in deep water offshore, where the pressures are much higher and it is much more technically challenging for obvious reasons. But again for the sake of argument, we will say that in the UK we do an absolutely terrible job and actually 1/10 wells end up badly sealed.

Just off that alone, this is a problem that will affect 0.01% of households.

So given the weight of evidence here, we can safely say with a reasonable degree of certainty that your drinking water will NEVER be contaminated by fracking.

I profoundly disagree with your conclusions here. 

Any country can afford to pay a given percentage of its GDP on healthcare. This can be derived from taxation, insurance, or direct cash payment. Charging healthcare users doesn't magically increase the pool of available funding. (It may even decrease available funding, because there's less emphasis on ability to pay.)

All that charging can achieve is demand management, and that isn't going to work too well. Either charges will be high enough to deter people who need to use the service, or they won't be enough to reduce demand. 

The US spends around 18% GDP on healthcare, this is about double what the UK spends. By this rune of thumb we could roughly double the NHS budget. There's a long way to go before the NHS runs out of money.

Honestly, I'm not an engineer. The two I know and have asked about fracking (since the first site in the UK was only 20 miles away from us) are pretty equivocal when answering questions like that.

When lots of business people are screaming ""PERFECTLY SAFE"" and lots of Scientists and Engineers are saying ""We just don't know"" I'm not exactly suffused with confidence.

The fact that 'ridiculous concerns' became 'overstated concerns' became 'causes for further study' is also a factor in my thinking - since it suggests even the people pushing this are less than certain.

Lastly, in terms of fracking I actually think the Oil price plummeting is something of a boon. If it were still $110/barrel I have little doubt exploitation would have outpaced the science.The oil price will eventually rise again and fracking will become more attractive, but if it **is** either inherently unsafe, or if those concerns can be corrected by better engineering standards, then the present moratorium will give us time to find out.",null,0,null,1423244033,null,0,false,0,cod8egx,null,t3_2uzbd9,null,t1_cod8egx,null,t1_cod7ndg,null,null,null,1424121136,null,32,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,32,null

The fact is that everything you do on the internet or telephone networks is like the writing on the back of a postcard. These systems are not secure. You have no idea whose hands your personal data and communications pass through.

Sure, the NSA and GCHQ etc have been very naughty, and we are naturally indignant about this: after all, who wants to live in a society where we are spied on by our governments? And why can't these spooks tell us just one single case where this mass-surveillance saved us from some terrorist plot?

Of course they can't, because they are spooks, and they have to maintain their secrecy, and get away with being naughty, in order to do their jobs.

So they are assholes, and we are righteously indignant, but we are still missing the real point about all this...

It's not just the security services, it's *everyone*. It's FaceBook and Twitter and Google and your phone company and the banks and the spammers and the big corporations and the governments and the police and the phishers and Microsoft and Apple and Comcast and anonymous...

It's all wide open, everything you do, everything you say, everywhere you go - it can all be monitored in this new digital age.

It's easy to set up an ISA or SIPP via the broker's online platform, and you can then buy a broad range of investments within this. Generally, diverse index trackers with low fees are a good option, with the allocation to more or less risky assets depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

The most important thing is to have a clear plan - what are you in this for, and what will your strategy be to get there? The simpler the better. The majority of individual investors significantly underperform the market (eg. the FTSE100 has historically returned an average of about 5% after inflation but most people only barely keep up with inflation) because they follow fads, they buy into bubbles, sell when the market crashes, pay extortionate fees to fancy managers, frequently trade individual stocks and basically do everything wrong in the hope of making a quick buck, usually on the false belief they know better than the market. Someone who just stuck £100 a month into a FTSE100 tracker fund wouldn't outperform the index, but they'd do better than most people. It's much harder to do that if you don't have a predefined goal (eg. house deposit in 10 years, retirement in 25 years) and a predefined strategy, because *anyone* can get caught up in the hype and believe 'it's different this time' - whether they end up buying or selling.

You really have to be on the ball and ready to run up to the agency or call as soon as you view the flat. 

Be prepared to pay two months rent plus a holding fee of a couple hundred.

2 bed room with a garden is going to set you back a bit, so you might need to look into the suburbs to avoid paying over a grand when you factor in council tax. 

If you have no rental history in the UK you will likely have to pay 6 months in advance - this happened to me when I came back home after 2 years abroad.

Take sports such as basketball, handball, hockey, rugby, etc. Referees are not to be debated with. A decision is a decision, even if the cause was unintentional. You just accept it and move on.

In football, the pressure is on the ref to interpret the situation and consider intent and also accurately imagine (what an oxymoron) what would have happened next if the foul didn't occur.

That is the only reason why refs are hated. If the rules were clear, and the refs were only there to enforce the rules (not interpret them) then we would see less pressure on refs and more fair decisions, I think. Yes, sometimes an accidental handball leads to a penalty, but at least it would do so consistently, and not depending on the mood of the referee. The question would be ""did the ball hit his hand?"" and not ""did he mean to block the path of the ball with his hand?"". It's actually provable and unmistakeable.

They have installed hard floors upstairs (which is on the borderline of acceptable) but I can hear everything: their conversations, the sawing, the hammering, the dropping of paint brushes, the knocking over of ladders, the electric sander, the angle grinder.... it's endless. And as I usually get home around 6 am for them to start on a sunday at 9:00 am and continue until 10:00 pm at night is just unacceptable. 

My point is to consider that we live in a community. Those of us who provide ambulance services, security, medicine, taxi services.... you name it... all night on a weekend... we deserve a little sleep. It's about respect and asking if it's okay to make noise at a certain time that's outwith the recognised times for said works to be done. Someone screwing a set of shelves in is not going to bother me. Major renovation works for 4 months has really made my health poorly because I haven't slept properly since October. 

The same goes for loud audio equipment at all hours. Most day-to-day noise like washers and walking around on the floor don't bother me. But, consider the people who work and live around you. That's all I was saying.

The thing that made it easy for me was a flexible instructor and 8 years driving a car. 
The instructor has to be right for you I'm 120mile down the road from you so can't recommend anything in your area but call a few and read reviews online till you find the right one.

If you don't already drive then the highway code and knowledge of how a clutch works will be a great benefit to the cbt. Your best bet for that is by talking with people you know who do and asking them questions about it. Then youtube. there's loads and loads of good stuff on youtube. 
The DSA have a selection of official videos for all the tests they also have a downloadable program that gives you access to all the questions they may ask on the theory test. (it also comes in book form) both for around £12 if i remember correctly. 
There are loads of great resources for new riders on youtube. search for people like 'roadcraftnottingham' and watch their videos and get a feel for what to expect. I don't think the tests differ A2 to what I done A (i'm over 24) 

As far as bikes go gumtree and ebay are great if you know what to look for in a well maintained bike. Do you have the skill/tools/money to repair it if it has a problem 50miles down the line? using a dealer you are paying a premium due to the fact that the bloke that owns it has to put his reputation on every bike he sells and normally a warranty to cover you if something does go wrong.

I'm not particularly bothered about the image. I find the attitude to smoking presented by many here to be, frankly, disgusting.

&gt;relax and enjoy the pleasures of life (like fe this picture) without getting angry over the small downsides of things. Learn to enjoy the little things in life!

No, you see smoking is not a small thing. As I've already said, it is one of the world's greatest threats to health.

You can very easily enjoy life and at the same time be concerned for the wellbeing of other people.

null,false,TJP343,null,null,null,"If you've read Inverting The Pyramid by Jonathan Wilson about the history of football tactics, Spurs have some historic links with both Ajax and Barcelona and one could so far as to say Spurs former players and coaches helped to shape the paths of both clubs who have at various points in the last 45 years brought the world some of it's best football in Ajax's total football sides of the 60s/70s, Cruyff's Dream Team at Barca in the 90s, Van Gaal's all conquering mid 90s Ajax side and most recently Pep's Barcelona.

Arthur Rowe won promotion to the old First Division in 1950 and followed it up with a First Division title in 1951 using a style of play know as push and run method of playing heavily predicated on the use of the 1-2 pass. It was a style of play first brought about by the Scottish, particularly Queens Park(not QPR) in the 1800s as the counter to the English style centered around dribbling.

In those sides managed by Rowe at Spurs were Vic Buckingham and Bill Nicholson, Spurs' greatest manager in it's history. Buckingham would twice manage at Ajax and introduced the legend, Johan Cruyff into the first team at Ajax. He also managed at Barcelona winning a Copa Del Rey the year before the inventor of total football, Rinus Michels arrived. 

Also the same man he preceded at Ajax? Rinus Michels. He twice laid the groundwork in the improvement of training and attitude at these two clubs for Michels to step into and take them to new heights of play, which at Ajax, the world had never seen before.

In Nicholson's time at Spurs he coached Terry Venables, who would go on to coach Spurs from 1987 to 1993 but before that he spent three years at Barcelona where he won La Liga, the first time Barca had done so since Michels' time with the Club and also won a Copa Del Rey. Venables was at the helm of the mighty Spurs the last time they lofted the FA Cup in 1991. Within a year of leaving Barca, Johan Cruyff took the side and created his Dream Team, in which a central role was played by Pep Guardiola, who now carries the torch lit by Michels and Cruyff at Ajax in the 1960s.

A part of the style of play that has mesmerized the world four times over was influenced by Rowe's push and run style of play and it was Englishman who had played for the mighty Spurs that prepared these teams for the brilliance that was to follow their tenure.",null,0,null,1423249278,null,0,false,0,codblj0,null,t3_2v04f6,null,t1_codblj0,null,t3_2v04f6,null,null,null,1424118074,null,16,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,16,null

But when other people do enjoy smoking you can just ignore it (obviously when a good mate of yours smokes multiple packs a day you need to adress it, but this is just a stranger on the internet who is appealed to smoking).

Ofcourse the WHO isn't pleased with smoking, it's their job to classify what is good for your health and what isnt. Obviously smoking is one of the latter, but it isn't lethal to smoke every now and then and it is also not lethal to find smoking cool or enjoyable. It only starts to get damaging and possibly lethal when you smoke a lot for a long time!

Lastly, smoking in general is quite a minor threat to peoples health, most people only smoke about 1 pack a week, which isn't enough to decrease you life expectancy by much.

My main point is that you shouldn't be bothered with how people feel about smoking, especialy not people on the internet. You should only be bothered by people who actualy become addicted and smoke way too much.

null,false,FezojT,null,null,null,"My main advice is to not hug the kerb. Road cycling can be intimidating, and you might feel that you're being a good road user by giving cars space to pass, but it's bad practice. While you shouldn't go everywhere in the middle of the road, be more assertive at maintaining your position on the road when approaching blind corners, parked cars, potholes etc. If you hug the kerb, a lot of motorists will try and overtake you, even if there isn't really enough space for them to do so. 

As an example, I was once riding in a country lane and was overtaken by a 4x4 on a blind corner. The driver was not quite past me when he noticed a car coming in the opposite direction, braked and pulled over hard to the left, nearly colliding with me. 

And again, I was on a roundabout and some guy thought he'd nip in front of me to get to his exit when I was going across it. He ended up having to break sharply to avoid knocking me off, beeped his horn and began swearing. 

In both cases, I should have occupied the road in a more central position, so that the motorists couldn't physically move past me. Yes, it pisses them off because they have to go a bit slower, but 1) they are encased in several hundred kilos of steel, and I only have my bones. The damage to the car will be superficial, but they could quite easily kill me. 2) I have to work and build up a sweat to maintain an average long distance speed of 18mph on my hybrid, and the acceleration is fairly slow. They only need to depress the accelerator pedal and they can jump to 60 in a matter of seconds. So really, what do I care if I end up costing an arsehole some precious seconds on his commute to work? I'd much rather be a minor inconvenience than encourage dangerous road use. 

Obviously if there are no passing places for quite some distance (sometimes a problem when I go cycling in some of the quieter lanes with thinner roads), it's courteous to pull over and let people past. But remember, you do it on your terms as an act of courtesy and only when you feel safe to do so.

I agree with those that say ""you can't just watch a highlights video and get a good sense of the player's contributions and failures,"" but you also can't just look at a guy's last match for a club he was about to leave and do the same.  

Not only is the video showing just one match (that could have been well below his average performance - or well above), but it also is from a match when Cuadrado had a lot on his mind.  He was playing while going through the emotions of his last match with a team he had been with for years, was feeling pressure from knowing that he was being looked at by many new eyes (media), and he was in the middle of a move from one country to another.  Again though, it could have simply been a bad performance by Juan - shoot, even Matic has had one of those this season and we aren't giving him the same criticism.  For those that find it painful to watch, have you seen any other full match highlight videos?  I have seen 4 or 5 recent full match highlight videos (for club and country) and can say that I am excited to see him play.  

We can't expect him to jump right into our squad and replace Willian day one, but within a month I expect to see him outshine the competition at right wing.  I think, though Cuadrado has played RWB before for Columbia, he will need time to understand what Jose wants from him defensively.  Offensively, I think he will only need 90 minutes to slot in.

I failed first time because of it, despite driving a car for nearly 20 years.

null,false,widgetas,null,null,null,"Some good advice from others here but as I've not seen it specifically:

Be aware of what's around you as much as possible by looking over the shoulder and what not. Obviously this is crucial when you move out to go around parked cars etc. I see numerous cyclists on my commute and give them a good deal of space and stay back before pinchpoints and all that. However I've noticed there seems to be several a week who I will follow for a while but never see look over their shoulder. When I'm out on the bike I'm looking quite often: some might say too much, but certainly when there's an obstacle coming up. It also serves to indicate to (aware) drivers, that you're about to do 'something'.

Others thing I tend to do are acknowledge drivers who have stayed back or given space - just a raise of the hand in thanks - as you do when someone lets you out in the car.

Don't be afraid to indicate that a driver is too close or similar: a hand 'pushing back' can be enough. Although it's not an excuse, many drivers seem to just be 'unaware' of the danger they're putting you in rather than being malicious.

&gt;several times this year I have had to refer a gentleman with learning difficulties to Denise (the local Reverend) for food due to him having sanctions on him for turning up late (once by 4 minutes). The gentleman can’t tell the time and is a recluse.

Response:

&gt;I hope that the hon. Lady appreciates that people who work very hard, and who might be earning very small amounts from working 50 hours a week, have to turn up to work on time. If they are late for their employment, they might be sanctioned by their employer. It is important that those who are seeking employment learn the discipline of timekeeping, which is an important part of securing and keeping a job.

What an absolute cunt.

Even given a chance to come back on it:

&gt;Nevertheless, I am happy to give way again if the hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr Spencer) wants to come back on this point: what would he expect someone with learning difficulties, who cannot tell the time, to do in that situation? He has no one to turn to for help and was sanctioned for being four minutes late.

Response:

Irregardless, the government through Help to Buy is helping people who *could* get onto the ladder but haven't. And I'm a little disturbed by your use of ""should"" - these people ""should"" be on the ladder? So nice middle class families who already have money ""should"" be able to buy houses and should get help from the state to do so, but single people and those on average wages ""should"" be consigned to being a landlord's income stream and the state should leave them where they are? That is distasteful.

And this is not to say that there is anything wrong with renting in and  of itself; the root cause of all of these issues, including those of renting costs and of Help to Buy, is the ridiculous above inflation and above incomes growth in house prices and the treating of houses as investments rather than as dwellings. House prices are too high and need to come down and Help To Buy does absolutely nothing to solve that and in fact makes it worse.

Gerrard will lunge in two-footed at Besic and only get booked.

Commentators will say it's a disgrace that Besic has been allowed to wind Gerrard up enough for him to do that and that such behaviour is ""not in Gerrard's character"".

Then, Besic will put in a perfectly good tackle, for which he will be sent off. The commentators will rejoice, for the villain has been cast asunder. Then, as Mr Jagielka defends his midfield terrier, Gerrard will throw a sly dig to him (which the commentators will describe as a little stumble). Naismith will see this and get all up in his bidness and also be sent off.

The commentator will applaud the referee for not letting the cowardly Everton players or fans intimidate him.

CBT is training. That's it.

You'll then get a certificate, and be allowed out on a 125cc with L plates.  
It is designed for people with zero knowledge.

Theory test - you can sit this now, if you want. You don't need your CBT. Or, you can wait.  
There are free apps for phones, where you can answer the questions. Just do them over and over - it'll help you learn the highway code too. Try not to guess answers that you don't know. See if you can work them out sensibly.

That's what you're missing. The people who believe the NHS is being built up to be privatised don't think it is a popular enough idea to be part of a mainstream manifesto.

If you believe privatisation would be a good thing for the NHS and a you have a whole country of people against that, it's undeniable that a good way to get that is to cripple it to the point where privatisation is the better option.

I think the main crux of the issue is not whether it is happening right now (although it is to a small extent) it is whether the inevitable cuts from a right-wing party are self-serving. Under the guise of austerity it is very easy to make social services awful enough for people to want more.

It isn't really a crazy thing to accuse a party like the Conservatives to be in favour of privatisation. It fits in with most of their ideologies. They contain a faction of free market conservatives who would love just that.

Even Cameron as a compassionate conservative is looking to shrink the size of the state. 

My overall point is you can't use the evidence that it's only a few percent of privatisation to rubbish the idea that they are trying. It's wholly in-keeping with their ideology. There is a libertarian element of free-market worship in the party. 

I haven't made my mind up either way. I don't trust the Conservatives at all.

IMO isotretinoin is a horrific drug but can be very effective as you say. Most people have some side effects not very few unfortunately, it is basically a controlled overdose of vitamin A. The monitoring from NHS hospitals is usually excellent and you should get some decent preparation and advice between the dermatologist, patient information leaflet and pharmacist. 

In the mean time keep up with any diet and lifestyle changes you are making because the stronger your skin barrier, joint tissues etc. are the less you will hopefully suffer with the severe dryness isotretinoin often induces. Essential fatty acids are particularly relevant: oily fish, seeds like pumpkin and chia, whole eggs etc. These are anti inflammatory, lubricating, used in the manufacture of cell membranes.

I highly recommend products containing medical grade lanolin for dry lips and so on. Options include Lansinoh (sold as nipple cream!!), if you feel silly carrying that about there is the [Lanolips line] (http://www.lanolips.com/uk/range-lips/) from Boots website, the Lemonaid lip balm is the most unisex and REALLY good, but some of the other products are packaged in pastel pink if that bothers you (I don't like it).

There is also lanolin in the Weleda Baby Calendula weather protection cream and Sudocrem nappy cream - sorry they are baby stuff, again you might want to keep those at home. A good balm/ ointment in unisex/ utilitarian packaging for being seen with is [Eucerin Aquaphor.] (http://www.eucerin.co.uk/products/aquaphor/wound-care-ointment) Another unisex/ utilitarian line: [Flexitol hand balm] (http://www.boots.com/en/Flexitol-Hand-Balm-56g_1225242/) and foot products are all decent - 10%+ urea plus lanolin.

He is writing just to read his own writing.

The most popular/accessible way to get internet is via your telephone socket, which is either a grade of ADSL or increasingly again in Urban areas, Fibre to the cabinet (FTTC) and then just the last section being copper wires.

Due to the way our industry was deregulated almost anyone can now offer Internet Services bundled with any other product or just on its own, down the phone line as these companies and pay for access to the infrastructure to deliver the service. 

The services vary by provided but typically are available with a bulk allowance (i.e. 20GB and after that throttling or usage fees) or 'Unlimited' (Subject to a fair use policy).

My internet, for instance, is FTTC so my modem plugs into the telephone socket. My television is provided by Sky.

NYCFC will definitely be a more convenient, accessible experience, but I saw LFC play City there in July and I can tell you it's not going to be a pleasant football-viewing experience.

I plan on catching a few games there this season as well just for the novelty and because its MLS football, but...

If you really want the best football-viewing experience this city (well, region), has to offer, make the 45 minute trek by train to Newark and watch the Red Bull. It's a remarkable stadium; 25,000 capacity and not a poor sight-line in the house. They'll also probably be better than NYCFC this season anyway.

**Price of product:** £12 for 30ml

**Where did you purchase:** Ishtar Skinlights

**Product claims:** *""An oil free organic serum with botanical enzymes and aspen bark extract to minimize and clarify pores. Enzymes scavange dead, dehydrated skin cells and improve skin texture and smoothness. Aspen bark extract works deep within pores to remove oily deposits. Trizyme serum can be used daily and is ideal for maintaining clear skin.*

*Because enzyme exfoliation is gentle, Trizyme serum is also ideal for using alongside treatments that can sometimes trigger slight dryness/flaking such as mandelic acid or retinol treatments. Used in conjunction with our Trizyme rich cream mask, Trizyme serum can eliminate flaking and boost the performance of these treatments.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because enzyme rather than physical or acid exfoliation is recommended in [roscea] (http://www.cosderm.com/fileadmin/qhi_archive/ArticlePDF/CD/021070383.pdf) and in [sensitive skin] (http://www.dermalinstitute.com/us/news/?p=862) generally.

&gt;Sir Humphrey: Minister, Britain has had the same foreign policy objective for at least the last five hundred years: to create a disunited Europe. In that cause we have fought with the Dutch against the Spanish, with the Germans against the French, with the French and Italians against the Germans, and with the French against the Germans and Italians. Divide and rule, you see. Why should we change now, when it's worked so well?
    
&gt;Hacker: That's all ancient history, surely?
   
&gt; Sir Humphrey: Yes, and current policy. We 'had' to break the whole thing [the EEC] up, so we had to get inside. We tried to break it up from the outside, but that wouldn't work. Now that we're inside we can make a complete pig's breakfast of the whole thing: set the Germans against the French, the French against the Italians, the Italians against the Dutch. The Foreign Office is terribly pleased; it's just like old times.
   
&gt; Hacker: But surely we're all committed to the European ideal?

&gt;    Sir Humphrey: [chuckles] Really, Minister.

&gt;    Hacker: If not, why are we pushing for an increase in the membership?

  &gt; Sir Humphrey: Well, for the same reason. It's just like the United Nations, in fact; the more members it has, the more arguments it can stir up, the more futile and impotent it becomes.
    
&gt;Hacker: What appalling cynicism.
   
&gt; Sir Humphrey: Yes... We call it diplomacy, Minister. 

and

&gt;    Hacker: Europe is a community of nations, dedicated towards one goal.

&gt;    Sir Humphrey: Oh, ha ha ha.

 &gt;   Hacker: May we share the joke, Humphrey?

&gt;    Sir Humphrey: Oh Minister, let's look at this objectively. It is a game played for national interests, and always was. Why do you suppose we went into it?
 
&gt;   Hacker: To strengthen the brotherhood of free Western nations.
   
&gt; Sir Humphrey: Oh really. We went in to screw the French by splitting them off from the Germans.

&gt;  Hacker: So why did the French go into it, then?
    
&gt;Sir Humphrey: Well, to protect their inefficient farmers from commercial competition.
   
&gt; Hacker: That certainly doesn't apply to the Germans.

Have you ever considered that the *only* reason such animals even exist in the first place in such numbers is *because* of factory farming?

They would have likely gone the way that many, many of the other mega-fauna of the earth went; into the grave under the spear and knife of early humans.

Animals get a relatively cushy life safe from predation and the need to forage for food. They also get to exist in far greater numbers than the natural environment would have ever provided for them.

As far as I can tell, I do more harm by voting and thus helping perpetuate the current system than by not voting. If I voted for the party I wanted to win, I'd waste my vote, because they have no chance of winning a seat in my constituency. As such, for my vote to matter at all, I have to vote for the party with the best chance of winning against the party I *least* want to win, which is bloody stupid because already I'm not being properly represented and the votes haven't even been counted, but still, the vote would have *some* impact.

Now, since the longer a party's in power, the more chance they have of losing the next election and since the only other party with a chance of winning a majority that *also* has a chance of winning in my constituency is Labour, the absolute most my vote will achieve is *maybe* getting Labour into power this election rather than the next one, which also risks pulling Conservative's next reign 5 years sooner (since putting Labour into power would make them more likely to lose the next or next-but-one general election). Keeping in mind all the while, Labour isn't even the party I *want* to vote for, I just don't like them ever so slightly less than I don't like the Conservatives.

Whether I vote or not, I'm not represented, but by voting I help perpetuate the system that doesn't represent me.

That does say anything about it doing something evil or good, or neutral.

In short - ideas don't have feelings, but people do.  In an open society we have a social contract that no ideas or ideologies are beyond criticism, even if by doing so the critic hurts people's feelings.  However, crude personal attacks do nothing to advance the debate and so should be avoided when possible. 

Think of how it works in science.  I could write a paper in which I mercilessly attack another author's hypothesis as unworkable, but I would absolutely draw the line at impugning my opponent's character.  Note that it may well be that the author is emotionally devastated by my criticism of her ideas, but that's just unavoidable if we want to advance science.
