For example, I am firmly of the the opinion that a major problem that causes poverty, or relative poverty, or whatever it is called now is the lack of affordable housing. In fact, that would raise the standard of living of a lot of people not in poverty. But, you fix that, and I mean fix that properly, and it will cause house prices to go down. The rental income of landlords will decrease. They don't want that. Some people would literally rather that some other people struggled so that the value of their house is higher. 

None of that is going to change under this government, none of that will improve. So that means that none of it will get better. In fact it needs to get so much worse, so that at the next election those people that are negatively affected will vote in numbers. There will have been far more press coverage of benefits sanctions, people dying because of it. The public perception of the poorer in society needs to change, so that those not in poverty will empathise and vote with them. For example this idea that all benefits claimants live rent free, don't work and have the state pay for their sky TV needs to die.

Self sufficiency should be the goal of every Republican though. Otherwise the transition to a United Ireland will basically be unworkable. 

That will probably mean some very difficult decisions for the left wing in the north. Small private companies find it difficult to compete with the wages in the Civil Service. I know a few people working in the Civil Service in Belfast who joke about how easy their job is. These are graduates with ambition, some are taking courses in accountancy etc., but few small firms that are trying to get off the ground can compete with the public sector in terms of job security, pensions and so on.

It is ironic that it is still the Republican strategy (in one way or another) to persuade the British to leave NI by hitting them in the pocket. There was a definite logic to it when the old Unionist Party before The Troubles was essentially allocating public funds preferentially to its own constituency in a sectarian manner to buy their votes, but it doesn't make sense now.

SF know that NI needs a strong private sector to make NI prosperous and therefore make a United Ireland viable. And that will mean painful cuts in the public sector. But it will be so much of a swing from their current strategy, especially in the South, that they will never admit it in public.

null,false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,null,"What a frustrating situation. When news of this contract dispute first emerged, I just figured it was the usual sort of banter that happens during contract negotiations. Then the whole situation seemed to get worse and worse. And then it got to a point where there was almost no way it would benefit Liverpool to force Raheem Sterling to stay.

I also think that Sterling isn't entirely at fault here and I do believe that his representation has got into his head and led him to some poor decisions or at least poor approaches to this situation.

I'm a bit frustrated because this massive transfer fee is both a blessing and curse.

The **blessing** is that we're getting a boatload of money and there was no way the club would (or should) ever expect to sell a future star at a discount price especially to another Premier League club.

The **curse** is that Liverpool FC is now seemingly flush with money. The natural inclination from supporters is to say, ""Right, we've got the cash now; Therefore, we can now get so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so.""

But we saw with the Luis Suarez money that it's not as easy as that.

Right now, I believe LFC faces a number of challenges in the transfer market:

* FSG's free-spending ways early in their tenure has seemed to have a set a precedent and/or the impression that you can get LFC to overspend.
* Our lack of regular Champions League play has certainly made it difficult to secure players we feel are ""good enough"" for Liverpool.

So, yes, the money from the Sterling transfer (when/if it happens) will be very nice but it doesn't necessarily mean that we have our choice of players at a fair price.",null,0,null,1434870611,null,0,false,0,csdmivo,null,t3_3ajzb5,null,t1_csdmivo,null,t3_3ajzb5,null,null,null,1437229039,null,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6,null

I don't disagree with you, but in certain circumstances central planning does work. The life expectancy in China doubled under Mao, and is generally considered one of the most rapid (some consider it *the* fastest) rises in living standards a population has ever seen. The Soviets turned the USSR from a feudal backwater to an industrial superpower that put the first man in space within two generations. Plenty of Western countries dabbled in Central Planning and nationalisation around this time to try to imitate the successes (it could be argued that this is why we have an NHS).

So it's probably a good way to quickly develop a poor country. There does seem to be a ceiling to what they can achieve though which is probably why both Russia and China eventually adopted market economies. But China still exerts a lot of state influence on their banks, building sector etc which did seem to see them through the Credit Crunch better than us.

&gt; Broadly speaking, countries making a substancial shift to GM crops are in a group where food secruity has either shown no improvement (e.g. United States), or where it is declining (e.g. Argentina).

&gt; The predictable pattern and quality of glyphosate herbicide use in GM agriculture has caused the evolution of resistance in weeds on a scale never experienced in the decades of glyphosate use prior to GM crops, leading to a return to tilling and the use of other herbicides for weed control...

This paper also argues that comparing USA and Canada GM crops with EU none GM crops ""...maize yields are very similar in the two agroecosystems, and Western Europes's rapeseed yields are about double those of North America. This trend has not changed since the adoption of GM plants in North America.""

And it talks about the problem of mono-culture which GM promotes and further problems like growing resistance. [Worm now thrives in GMO corn designed to kill it] ( http://www.newsweek.com/worm-now-thrives-gmo-corn-designed-kill-it-study-says-232276)


There are also no studies that show GM has LONG TERM yield increases.

Then we can go on to the economic argument. GM is just terrible economics, giving the power of the food supply to a handful of transnational corporations [which have monopolistic power] (http://www.etcgroup.org/sites/www.etcgroup.org/files/CartelBeforeHorse11Sep2013.pdf)

[Lobbying is also a problem] (http://www.taxpayer.net/images/uploads/downloads/Political_Power_of_Farm_And_Crop_Insurance_Lobbies_Fact_Sheet.pdf) We surely do not want a handful of companies to have so much power over something as important as the food supply. It has not worked well in the banking sector, utilities, fossil fuels... Monopolistic power is terrible for consumers and great for corporations. We don't want massive food corporations that are too big to fail.

There is a lot to be worried about including [our dwindling food varieties] (http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/07/food-ark/food-variety-graphic) which GM does nothing to address and possibly increases the problem.

Firstly, the amount of money there is to be made through fracking and the lengths that fracking/oil companies have shown they will go to in using these resources and the political power they bring elsewhere.

Secondly, the track record (and sometimes the lack of track record) of the companies lining up to become involved.  Halliburton is not a nice corporation.  Several of the others are cowboy outfits, and some have pretty much zero experience of operating this sort of business and limited resources to pay when they inevitably fuck up.

Thirdly, the degree of infiltration by fracking interests into the government and regulatory organisations.  Lord Browne's place men and women remain, even though he doesn't.

Fourthly, the steps the UK government has already taken to facilitate fracking and help to make it artificially profitable, even though the local commnities have made it quite clear they do not want it with or without bribes.

Fifthly, the likely density of well sites in the UK compared to the density of wellsites in much larger countries where public health effects have been found, and the inevitably far greater proximity to areas of dense human habitation.  Even equally tight regulation would out be nearly sufficient, it would have to be orders of magnitude more tight.  Ironically enough, in the US there is  strong move to ban fracking within distances from urban areas that would be very difficult to achieve in the UK on our relatively more crowded little island.

Sixthly, the complexity of UK geology compared to the US/Aus.

I don't care what you like, you're wrong about this. While the Daleks have no compassion, pity, or love, they experience fear, and hate. They always have. We actually see Davros remove specific emotions from them in ""Genesis of the Daleks"". They were modelled on Nazis, hating everything that was not pure Kaled, that was different from them. Kaled that were not pure enough were called ""mutos"" and banished from the Kaled city. Daleks are scared of the Doctor, and fear and hate all life that is not themselves. The Doctor always had a lot in common with the Dlaeks, and I really enjoyed seeing that explored in both ""Dalek"" and ""Into the Dalek"".

But the Daleks have been at war with many races, such as the Mechanoids, Draconians, Exxilons, Movellans, not to mention the obvious Thals. The Doctor also mentions the many alliances different races around the universe formed in order to fight the Daleks.

**Jeremy Corbyn** 

**Left looney** lets take a look at what he has supported over the years

* Part of the 2001 Stop the War Coalition
* Backed Plaid Cymru/SNP calls for an inquiry into the war. 
* Strong anti-poverty advocate
* Voted against introducing tuition fees and any increase
* Opposed private finance initiatives
* Supports renationalisation of railways
* Supports higher minimum wage
* Higher rate of tax for the wealthiest and an increased corporate tax rate
* Campaigner against Apartheid in South Africa
* Supporter of a United Ireland, inviting Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams to London in 1984, one of the first to speak with Sinn Féin?
* Amnesty International member
* Campaigned for the trial of the late former Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet
* Long-time campaigner on animal rights issues
* Signatory to Michael Meacher's Climate Change Early Day Motion
* Campaigned against the Gaza–Israel conflict and promotes the Palestine Solidarity Campaign.
* Venezuelan solidarity activist
* Advocated for the rights of the forcibly-removed Chagossians to return to the British Indian Ocean Territory.
* Called for dialogue between the UK and Argentine governments on the question of Falkland Island sovereignty
* One of 16 signatories of an open letter to Ed Miliband asking to oppose further austerity, which was followed up by 80 economists saying it made no sense to support austerity. 

Corbyn is a socialist but many successful socialist democracy nations around the world.  Scandinavian falls under this camp and has not fallen off a cliff.  Germany, Holland and many more have been just as successful as the UK but with socialist policies. 
Some people may say the UK should not go back to the 50s/60s/70s but they appear to forget that was one of the best periods for the UK also one of the most stable.  Had lower inequality/higher social mobility long list of other things.  We have lost many things which held communities together and done some major damage at a social level. 

Don't get me wrong not saying we should pull policy from the 70s or 50s back but we should look at building a system which works for now.  We have a pension system designed in the 50s for 2015 which leaves many poor in old age without support. Work life balance which sucks you dry for years. 

Stronger economic case for higher taxes compared to what some people think. No evidence that lower taxes create more growth but they do cost us more in human cost and picking up the pieces.  Bill gates has called on the world to look at business tax again saying it does not stop people investing when rates was higher.  Many other super rich who have called on rethink of taxes around the world.

IF Jeremy corbyn can present the above as looking right wing and counter any attacks. He could be the real alternative and something the Tories fear. Problem is as the above post proves many people view him as a left loony if you look at the reality history is going to judge him as being correct on so many points.

Would say that real loonies are the ones who have been moved the UK into a worse direction and won't look at the alternatives or have the balls to challenge it. 

End of the day most of the public supports what Jeremy corbyn stands for. Problem is making sure his message gets out and he can defend his message.   Labour lost due to failing to define the future and defend the past.  Also lost due to failing to turn Labour into a movement and making the grass roots weaker.

Allen. Squad player. Good energy from the bench. In certain games use him to man mark a playmaker and piss them off.

Top 4 starter? No.

Lucas. Awesome on his day. Erratic on his day. A poor man's Mascherano? You betcha. 

Top 4 starter? No. Breaks my heart but no. I think with Can, Allen, Hendo, Milner, Rossiter and a possible new target? Soon it'll be time for another legend's farewell.

Gerrards gone. Can't underestimate that gap in the squad. Since Alonso and Mascherano our only CM who would walk into the other top 4 sides.

Milner in to play that role according to reports. Hell of a workhorse and great long ball ability. I know he's a marmite player but I think he's as good as any of the names we're throwing around for this position (Song, Illaramendi etc). Great signing for me.

I think the option we need is a Yaya-esque rangey powerhouse.
I think there's a ready made target in Moussa Sissoko. In a better team that bloke could be awesome and he fits the FSG/Brendan profile. Quite young (25), adaptable to different midfield positions, hard worker, quick.

I think a lot of people would rather the Blair's just disappeared off the face of the planet and stopped doing any more damage to the world, to be honest. It's not unreasonable after what they did to our country while in power. And you only have to look at Blair's time as Middle East Peace Envoy to see how good he is at doing anything beneficial for the world. 

We don't need sociopaths like Blair and his wife setting up ""businesses"". If it doesn't involve dealing with corrupt regimes and selling insider information to foreign governments, they just aren't going to be any good at it. 

This story is reminiscent of when Blair set our country up for a massive financial collapse and promptly fucked off, knowing that the wheels were about to fall off within a matter of years.  

A sociopathic leader that stays until the end and falls on his sword can at least be respected in a small way. But one that fucks off before it all implodes, that's the difference between having a warped sense of morals and just being completely morally bankrupt.

&gt;PSG midfielder Marco Verratti wants to change clubs, according to Marca.
&gt;
&gt;The Italian has gone from strength to strength during his three seasons at the Parc des Princes and his performances have attracted attention from around the Continent.
&gt;
&gt;Now, according to Marca, he feels his time in French football is drawing to close and he wants to try his luck elsewhere.
&gt;
&gt;Marca adds that he would look favourably upon a move to either Real Madrid or Barcelona. Both La Liga giants have been linked with him in the past few months, although Madrid published a statement earlier this month which denied reports that they had already established contact with PSG or the player’s representative.

This is a bit early, but when you're in Year 12, you can apply to do a [Nuffield Research Placement](http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/nuffield-research-placements). They're competitive, and having a good application doesn't necessarily mean that you'll get a place - it all depends on whether there is a place matching your interests which is offering a placement near to you in a particular year.

Otherwise, if you live near a university, try emailing science/technology/engineering/maths departments, to see if they are willing to let you shadow someone for a while. There are also various research/science parks around the country that might take students, but it does depend on having one near you.

Small businesses are also generally happy to help - depending on where you live, science-related will probably mean engineering/manufacture, but even as a more ""pure"" scientist, these can be helpful in narrowing down your interests.

Assuming that you're a Year 11 who's finishing exams and the rest of your school is still up and running, you could ask if it's possible to help the lab technician. It'll probably only be during term-time, but could be useful until the end of July.

Keep a diary of their noise and nuisance - this is the important part because Environmental Health will want this, note the times (as accurate or abstract as you like) along with a description of the weather and the noise.

Find out who their landlord is and write. I usually do this with an anonymous email account to begin with (for obvious reasons). Send them the details of your complaint using words like ""anti-social"" ""breach of tenancy"" and ""noise abatement"".  This is usually enough to get the landlord to write to the tenant and curb it, if it doesn't that's when you need to involve Environmental Health and CC their landlords to everything.

The people you need to speak to are the EHO(Environmental Health Office) at the council. Even if their official office is closed, there should be a council switchboard number that you can call which is 24 hours. Resources vary from council to council but the operator will be able to advise you if there is anything they can do then and there.

&amp;nbsp;

Things the EHO like you to do is keep a diary of events with exact times of start and finish, and an approximate description of the noise. Recordings also help, even if they're on a mobile phone or whatever. If your wife is pregnant, I would try and lean on that a bit - anything that may force them into action.

The only reason to prioritize buying a player for the deep midfield spot is if Lucas for some reason (him wanting away or Rodgers not being keen on him anymore) isn't going to be around.

I'm not going to argue on this topic, you are entitled to your opinion, but there, for example, is research by greenpeace on a number of topics.

It doesn't matter if it's sponsored, independent or done by someone directly in the industry it's becomes very apparent when shitty science is being published.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11683835/5.7bn-bill-to-stop-the-Palace-of-Westminster-falling-down.html

&gt;Every taxpayer in Britain will have to pay up to £240 to fund the restoration of the Houses of Parliament unless MPs agree to move out for at least six years while the work takes place.

&gt;Crucial work to prevent the Palace of Westminster falling down could cost as much as £7.1 billion and take four decades, an independent report found on Thursday.

&gt;The cheapest option would cost £3.5 billion – or £118 for every income tax-payer – but would force MPs and peers to vacate the buildings and move into temporary accommodation for six years, the report said.

&gt;If MPs insist on remaining on the historic site while works are carried out - an option favoured by senior Government figures - costs are estimated at £5.7 billion but could soar as high as £7.1 billion, or £240 per taxpayer.

&gt;Even under this option, which is likely to take 32 years but could take as long as 40, it would be ""essential"" for MPs to vacate the House of Commons chamber for a period of two to four years, during which a temporary chamber could be constructed in a courtyard of the Palace.

Back-Up Striker: With Weimann gone we'll need a replacement. 

Centre Back: While I like Okore and think he'll be a great defender in the future, I think we really need 1 more solid first team quality centre back to pair up with Clark. Knowing the injury luck of Aston Villa defenders we should probably buy like 10.

Midfield: Not sure about this tbh. I'm kind of happy with a midfield three of Delph-Westwood-Gardner with Bacuna, N'Zogbia and Sanchez as back-up/rotation.

Right-Wing: Assuming we never see a return of Gil this is also urgent. We've got Sinclair and Grealish on the left which is great but literally no actual right wingers.

It's been the seat of government since the 1500s! When the Royal Family did have to repair a property (Windsor Castle) after it was damaged by fire, the stumped up 70% of the £50 million repair bill by themselves by opening up Buckingham Palace to visitors, and the remaining 30% was paid by Parliament in exchange for the Royal Family to start paying tax on their income.

Putting your petty and ignorant grievances to one side, the Palace of Westminster is a grade 1 listed building. It's considered one of the best examples of gothic architecture in the wold. Letting it fall into ruin would be a terrible thing... and even if we simply knocked it down, we'd still need to build a new building to hold our legislative chambers... and that will never come cheap. Constructing the far less ambitious Holyrood building in Edinburgh cost just shy of £0.5bn. When Labour announced it, it was only meant to cost £40 million... parliamentary chambers are expensive projects.

It's also worth pointing out to you that the reason the repair bill is so high is because a) when the buildings were last renovated in the 50, 60s and 70s the construction firms extensively used asbestos which now needs to be removed safely at great cost. In addition, the building has to be constructed to a high specification considering it will house our entire government at a single time - making it a ripe target for some Islamic extremist with an axe to grind.

Now, if Rodgers is going to use Ilori and Gomez as back-ups behind a preferred pairing of Skrtel and Sakho, fine by me. But I don't see that happening. So what will happen is probably that Gomez will be shoved around to different clubs on loan deals and then end up being sold to one of those clubs, like Coates. 

At least that's a risk, which kind of sucks. What he has going for him though is that he's also played right fullback.

null,false,CamelWithoutHumps,null,null,null,"I absolutely think we should buy another holding mid, I posted this in a thread the other day but it got buried because it was quite an old post.

Coutinho and Lallana are our best players when Sturridge is out injured. However they are not wingers, they are much better played through the middle. We played our best football this season with Coutinho and Lallana in behind a striker in the 343 system and I believe Coutinho and Lallana were the reason for this. I feel next season when Sturridge isn't fit we should play again in a twin number 10 role like [this](http://i.imgur.com/eRZCAXT.png), with our fullbacks providing the width.

I don't want us playing with a back three because it limits Hendo to a holding role in a midfield 2, I prefer to have him in a box to box role in a midfield 3. I want our full backs to be pacey and fit and be able push forward and track back as much as possible and be an attacking threat, however for that we need a quality holding midfielder who for the most part stays back while we are on the attack so that he can help the centre backs if we possibly get caught on the counter. Contrary to what most people say on this subreddit I don't believe Can offers this, he's naturally a box to box type player, and would fit into the positions that Henderson and Milner play, for this reason I think it is important for us to sign a new holding midfield player because of Lucas' injury problems.

It is absolutely key that we sign a proven quality centre forward who is mobile and has good finishing. I think Ings might surprise me, but I think we would be mad not to splash big money on a striker this window. When Sturridge is fit we could also play a diamond with him alongside our new hypothetical striker as [such](http://i.imgur.com/TKp6lAl.png).

1) This isn't someones house and hasn't been since 1512, and even then it was a facility for government with royal chambers attached for convenience. It's a debating chamber for government, and every single nation on the planet has one - even North Korea has one.

&gt; Maybe they should move into somewhere more modern, and more centralised to the country they govern

2) Centralised like in the capital city which also happens to have about 20% of the countries population and access to its business, industrial, communication and financial centres... because that's not going to be cheap. As I linked elsewhere, building the far smaller Holyrood buildings in Scotland cost just shy of £0.5bn some years ago. Acquiring a sizable tract of land in London and then constructing a hardened facility on it (because it WILL be a terrorist target) with all the physical tunnels, communication centers, bunkers etc. will be massively expensive. It'll easily cost in the same price range - if not higher.

As I pointed out, **THIS IS NOT A CHOICE BETWEEN GIVING £7bn TO THE POOR, OR SPENDING IT ON PARLIAMENT**. It's a choice between repairing a grade 1 listed building and using it as the seat of government, or building a different seat of government at the same (or more likely increased) cost.

&gt; If it's a cultural icon, open it as a tourist attraction and make money off it.

This isn't some silly little tourist trap to squeeze money out of Chinese tourists. It's the seat of government, and we will still need a parliamentary chamber whether its this one or a new - as yet un-constructed one. 

Also, opening Buckingham Palace up to tourists for £8 a head over 2 years only raised [£2 million](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/31069.stm)... the cost of repairing this is projected at £7bn... so it'll take about 7000 years of tourism to pay for these repairs using your tourism model to pay for it.",null,0,null,1434888354,null,0,1434888581,0,csdqbej,null,t3_3al72e,null,t1_csdqbej,null,t1_csdq5y4,null,null,null,1437544353,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

Yeah because everyone who has ever been on benefits is still just as poor and didn't use it to get themselves into a better position...

But let's say you're right. Even those who didn't get themselves into a better position, and are still just as poor... their behaviour can also be explained away as not their fault. There are new studies coming out, suggesting that scarcity of resources takes such a toll on our mental bandwidth, that we are effectively more stupid as a result. That the poor's lack of money inherently makes them more dumb, and hence has them making worse decisions, potentially rendering them perpetually poor.

If there is £3,000,000 to be saved, it should be. That's £3,000,000 for another signing, a players wages or club development. 

Think of £3,000,000 more than an amount of money, the value of its utility will be significantly different in different situations. If Southampton are willing to sell at £13,000,000 and we pay them £15,000,000 that £3,000,000 has only had a utility to us of £1,000,000. If the £3,000,000 goes towards to the payment of a top striker who then scores 20+ goals that drives us into CL, that £3,000,000 might have had a utility of £20,000,000 to us.

It is not the end of the world for that to be in a clear bottle, tho it should be relatively fresh and used within a reasonable time frame. It seems most likely your adverse reaction was to one of the fragrance ingredients since these are known irritants/ allergens (second most common topical allergen after nickel).

Check out the three vitamin C entries in the [ingredients Wiki] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/ingredients), plus the vitamin C [mega review] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2vvj7h/the_vitamin_c_reviews/) in the sidebar which is divided up by form of vitamin C. The [Ishtar Skinlights] (http://www.ishtarskinlights.com/skin-treatments/vitamin-c) sodium ascorbyl phosphate products seem very gentle and are fragrance-free. 

The SR Skincare [10% CE ferulic] (http://www.sr-skincare.co.uk/30ml-10-vitamin-c-serum-25-p.asp) is also relatively gentle, despite being based on the acid form it only stings my reactive skin (rosacea) when it is already irritated. It is also well formulated and in an airless pump. The pH is apparently 3.4 to 3.6 so not nearly as low as other L-ascorbic acid products.

Personally I never recommend OST C20: it is badly formulated, loaded with drying alcohol which is not recommended for dehydrated skin, very low pH so irritating and will become more so as the L-AA degrades.

Let's say you need 85% coverage of the 2 month to 19 year old demographic (roughly 13 million people). This puts the initial cost at £2.6 billion with a continuing annual cost of £160 million.

Let's assume all the 560 people severely affected will lead 95% of their 81 year life expectancy without a serious impairment of their quality of life if  all are vaccinated. This gives us a benefit of 43,000 QALY. This gives us £60,500/QALY upfront with £3,700/QALY per additional year.

Based on these back of the napkin calculations, the vaccine actually seem reasonable (although the upfront cost for the first cohort is pretty bad). The NHS currently works on £30,000 or so per QALY.

Say a child gets Meningitis B, survives and becomes severely disabled as a result, not only will they require state-funded support for a long period of time, they will also require care, which may take a parent out of work to provide or require a state funded carer, not to mention the associated cost of treatment.

If the child is vaccinated, and hence is not long term disabled, they  won't require as much treatment, will grow and become economically active themselves, the parent/carer is able to be more economically active as a result.

null,false,FezojT,null,null,null,"I think the argument *for* austerity is often presented in very easy terms to understand (""We've maxed out the nation's credit card"") that do not in fact reflect the real complexities of running a developed economy. It's not like a household budget because we can print money, borrow cheaply, invest in our economy and the debt repayment timescale lasts several lifetimes. 

I'm no economist, but my understanding is the following:

* The Labour government ran a ~~*healthy*~~ (normal/stable) deficit of something like 3% prior to the financial crisis. This is the normal thing for a government to do in a time of strong economic growth, because it means 1) the money we pay in taxes is being returned to us in public services 2) future investment in the health of the economy is made by putting money into it 3) the deficit run is small. The UK is good at repaying its debt so interest rates are low, so the efficient thing to do is borrow the money and invest it to stimulate growth; as long as the return on the investment is larger than the interest repayment rate then we're doing the sensible thing. 

* The financial crisis hit in 2008 due to speculative trading on the US housing market. People were investing money that didn't really exist, the bubble inflated and popped, people recalled debts and the banks couldn't afford it. The US housing market crashes and the ripples are felt in most of the world's economies. It has nothing to do with Labour's fiscal policies, though we could have weathered the storm easier if we'd had spare money lying around (but nobody could see it coming. If we had spare money lying around, the legitimate question to ask is why are you taxing us so much if you don't need to?). 

* In order to prevent the UK economy going to shit, the government *had* to bail out the banks so they could repay their debts. In order to do this the UK government had to increase its debt. We suddenly have a huge jump in the size of the deficit because of this added burden; the economy tanks it for a bit, the interest repayments are larger and we're not getting growth so interest repayments overtake investment return. 

* Measures are taken to try and amend the situation. Interest rates are held low to promote borrowing for business investment and the central bank prints money so there's more flowing round the economy. Things aren't rosy but it's not looking apocalyptic. 

* A general election is held. The Conservative party campaigns on a mantra of cuts and balancing the books. The argument is simpler to understand than explaining the nuances of economics and at this stage we still have a problem, so they get about a third of the vote and the coalition is in government. 

* They set about cutting budgets for various public sector departments and services in order to reduce the deficit, as they said they would. They also offer tax breaks to people across the income spectrum. This should set alarm bells ringing; if we're in such dire straits that we need to start cutting things like defence spending, welfare spending, ring-fencing health budgets etc. why is it we're also able to cut back the amount of money we take in through taxes, and why are we targeting the welfare state (or rather, the small part of the welfare state that isn't pensions) when there's a much bigger gap missing in our finances from large companies avoiding taxes? The trend has continued into the current Conservative government, with the promise of further tax cuts coupled with further cuts to the state. 

Now I'm not saying cuts are a bad thing. The two ways you balance the books as the Conservatives have proposed is to either cut spending or increase taxation, but it makes little sense to cut both for the purposes of deficit reduction. What appears to be happening is a set of idealogical policies are being pushed forward that aim to reduce the size of the state/private sector, *which would be fine* if they said that was what they were doing instead of using deficit reduction as an excuse. 

So what would I like to see? I think efficiencies can be made in spending, so I'm not saying everything should be exempt from cuts, *but* I think if we're going to cut things under the guise of austerity we shouldn't also be giving ourselves tax breaks. We should be making sure we collect all the tax we're entitled to, especially when it comes to large companies (Google, Amazon, Apple *et al.*). I think we also shouldn't be setting arbitrary deadlines on deficit elimination, because slashing money out of the economy harms growth, and growth is a requirement for having no deficit; we're always going to have debt repayments to make because our economy has a trade deficit. Thatcher's economic reforms mean we no longer make and sell things, so it's not enough to just stop spending so much and wait for our trade income to fill up the pot again, we need to economy to grow to account for the deficit between our imports and exports. I think more can be done to ensure our economy grows (indeed, the Conservative/coalition government has presided over the slowest economic recovery from recession in a century) but it instead appears the government is motivated by its ideology, not genuine economic concern.",null,0,null,1434891927,null,0,1434903003,0,csdral3,null,t3_3alk0n,null,t1_csdral3,null,t3_3alk0n,null,null,null,1437232237,null,200,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,200,null

You should always be in the left-most lane unless you are in the process of overtaking another vehicle or anticipate a space will be imminently required (i.e. when there is traffic merging from a slip road or when someone - correctly in an inside lane - is approaching another slower vehicle and is expected to move into the an overtaking lane to pass them).

Maybe this makes more sense

http://www.inbrief.co.uk/media-law/police-media-conflict.htm

&gt;Police officers have been known to arrest press photographers at tense, tumultuous events or the scenes of accidents. Members of emergency services have reportedly called for such arrests because they did not want press photographers or film crews there, not because of any legal reasons. 

&gt;Arrests of media photographers can occur according to the powers granted to police officers under the Public Order Act 1986. This states that they may arrest anyone using behaviour likely to cause ‘harassment, alarm or distress’ and is the most likely legal grounds for a police officer to warn a media photographer that he/she may be arrested. 

&gt;A further example occurred when a BBC cameramen was arrested in 1995 after he filmed scenes of a coach crash. The police officers who arrested the cameraman stated that he had refused to leave a ‘volatile situation’ and that the arrest for as much for his own safety as anything. At an appeal, the judge remarked that he had acted without regard for the feelings and rights of others.

Ings is already accustomed to the physicality and speed of the English game and scored near on just as much. Vietto is a bit light in the strength department, might not settle well in this league with his small frame and less time on the ball. 

Ings is the far safer bet, and has some really desirable traits. He's strong, quick, presses hard intelligently, has skill, great awareness, good in the air and good at scoring. Most people don't know that though, they just know he comes from unglamorous Burnley and he's English so he must be shit. Vietto on the other hand is a top talent because he plays abroad and is foreign.

Another one I've seen in a recent thread is people who have been shitting on Benteke as he wouldn't fit our system saying we should look at Rondon  These players are near enough identical. Fairly quick, strong, good in the air, predatory in the box. They have an almost identical goal scoring record and Rondon would be barely be cheaper if at all.

&gt; Plus salary increases tend to be incremental, a candidate on 100k is not going to jump to 130k even if the client salary range is 130-150k 

Yeah that was the primary reason I stopped giving it out. When I stopped giving out my current salary, I instantly got a 45% salary increase. Honestly, if we stop basing the expectation on current salary or what minimum the candidate can accept, I think we both will make way more money. If you think about it, it has no bearing whatsoever on the value the candidate will bring.

I'd suggest the following. Ask me what my skills and expertise is etc. Then suggest a typical salary range, without asking me any numbers. If that's 130-150K, sell us in that range. You'll get more money than selling us at 100K or 110K or whatever right?

Inded, it's good for a government to run a deficit, and this country has for the vast majority of the past 200 years to no detriment at all. Indeed, that's probably why we have such a high international credit rating. We're a proven good risk. Just like your personal credit rating would tank if you never *used* credit, so the country's would tank if we were to clear the national debt and keep it cleared.

What I would do is borrow more and invest to grow. A strong economy also generates confidence and growth, and confidence and growth right now is something we desperately need. Make the whole country (not just London) look like an attractive place for foreign and domestic investment - make the whole country a good place to do business and ""they will come"".

This country made its' name in the world by branching out into it - violently and oppressively. Now the time is right to branch out into the world again, but peacefully and progressively. London basks in the glory of multi-trillion pound foreign investment that is sorely needed by the rest of the country, so what's needed is a vast investment in infrastructure, transport links, advertising and the loosening of strictures around redevelopment of abandoned land.

There is a potential boom to be had in every industry that relies on construction, as many towns and cities are blighted by crumbling civic infrastructure and a desperate need for more housing, while former industrial sites lay derelict and abandoned due to legislation and restrictive planning rules. We need a dedicated 20 yeares or more where we invest heavily in freeing those sites for redevelopment - environmental cleanup, changes in planning laws, making it easy for foreign planners to build their stuff here, while we repair the railways, improve our roads, make our airports more efficient. We're a small island, there's no excuse for how long it takes and how expensive it is to get somewhere else in a hurry.

With a strong foundation, we can build a strong country and the 85% of the country that's not London can share the riches that entails.

Vast tracts of the country haven't seen any investment since the 80's. Nobody can tell me that making those communities, towns and cities a viable prospect for new business is a bad thing.

Ok, so there's 3 lanes in a British motorway. 

1) The left hand/outside lane which is connected to the exit/entry ramps

2) The middle lane

3) The right hand/inside lane (closest to the median strip)

You must drive in 1 at all times. However, it's clogged up because all the traffic is there, lorries are mandated to stay in that lane and you have to wait for people to slow down to get on/off. That sounds incredibly stressful and dangerous. 

Then you have 2, the middle lane which is supposedly just for overtaking. But what's the point of that if you have 3 and the speed limit is still the same? All lanes are 70mph anyway. However, it's still faster than lane 1 as it's not as clogged up.

Then you have 3, which is a bit redundant. It's not like Germany where theres no speed restriction, following the 20 second rule, just to overtake. It's still 70mph. But I wouldn't drive there if it's essentially the same as the middle lane as that means I'd have to quickly skate across two lanes to get back to lane 1 in order to exit.

So, it's just easier to stay in the middle lane, cruise at a constant speed, not have to worry about others speeding (thus tailgating you) like in lane 3 but not be held up by the traffic in lane 1. And you can change lanes to lane 1 with ease as you only have to cross one lane. And I don't have to weave in and out throughout the journey (1 to 2 then back, or 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 then back). Far easier to stay in the middle lane (2) which is safer as it's not as crowded as lane 1 and more predictable with regards to speed (ie: constant 70mph) than lane 1 (slow) and lane 3 (overtaking weavers)",null,1,null,1434892563,null,0,1434896913,0,csdrhnp,null,t3_3aliyu,null,t1_csdrhnp,null,t3_3aliyu,null,null,null,1437232381,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

For things like Blue Planet though if they were available for download constantly all anyone would have to do is VPN to the UK and get it instantly, no other broadcaster or distribution service in their right mind would buy a series that could be accessed like that. If the BBC couldn't sell its products your license fee would skyrocket.

Unless you went for an absolute celebrity fan of the show who, let's be honest, will have better things to do. 

With the fan show, it's a YouTube show. YouTube aims for a particular demographic, of a youngish fan crowd (because YouTube generally skews to a younger demographic) and therefore wanted someone who isn't too old, or too young, but still obsessive...because that is their reasons for being there. If you have a host who is not being entirely obsessive about doctor who and doctor who alone, they don't belong on a program which is about doctor who and doctor who alone, they belong in their own YouTube channel which can cover many things (this isn't a criticism either)

In your opinion. I think it's better to agree to disagree.

&gt; The idea of ""I don't directly use X so I shouldn't pay for it"" doesn't work.

Except that, you know, that's precisely how the BBC's funding method has worked since inception, and that seems to have got them to where they are today without much of an issue.

&gt; I definitely agree but we're not at the stage of choosing between the BBC or the NHS.

We are at the stage where other funding models will be considered, with the possibility that it becomes a real tax e.g. an internet tax. Given the choice, I'd rather give an additional tenner a month to a truly public service that is crying out for money and not the BBC.

&gt; but the BBC needs people speaking out for it more than ever during a reformation

Which should be based on facts, not people pushing their opinions onto others, like your own personal opinion on value

&gt; it would be a huge shame if it was gutted in the process.

Its role should reflect what the public wants in the modern age. We aren't in a situation where the BBC was one half or 2/3rds of what you can watch on TV, and basically the only thing on the radio (like in the 60s or 70s).

I'm happy to agree to disagree. Saying something is shortsighted isn't an insult, it is my opinion.


&gt;Except that, you know, that's precisely how the BBC's funding method has worked since inception.

Well I think that is actually being a bit too kind to the license fee, if you have a TV that you use to watch live TV you have to pay, even if you never watch a BBC channel. And with that wide a net it covers pretty much everyone.


&gt;We are at the stage where other funding models will be considered, with the possibility that it becomes a real tax. Given the choice, I'd rather give an additional tenner a month to a truly public service that is crying out for money and not the BBC.


I understand that but if everyone could choose what they pay towards we'd probably end up with the best health service in the world by far and the worst prison service for example. And to be honest BBC funding would probably improve because it has much better name recognition than the huge expanse of publicly funded areas most people have never heard of.

&gt;Which should be based on facts, not people pushing their opinions onto others, like your own personal opinion on value


Well again it's all a matter of opinion when it comes to the BBC, you can't get a comprehensive factual value on Soft Power or contribution to the Arts and Education, that doesn't mean it's not very valuable.


&gt;Its role should reflect what the public wants in the modern age. We aren't in a situation where the BBC was 2/3rds of what you can watch on TV, and basically the only thing on the radio (like in the 60s or 70s).

null,false,Monztaa,lfc68,,null,"Problem is that Rodgers is very much like Arrigo Sacchi in this regard. Sacchi wanted the 'all rounder player - the universal player', that is a player that was comfortable in any position. Contrast this with Rafa or Simeone, who both believe that specialists is the way to go. A specialist target man, a specialist defensive winger, a specialist attacking full back. A specialist midfield destroyer.

Rodgers is like Sacchi. He wants all the midfielders to be able to play any role in the midfield at any time. Gerrard is not a defensive midfielder for example. But he can turn, get the ball, and ping long balls and through balls like a number 10 would. Henderson is a workaholic, he'll press and hassle you until you lose the ball, but Rodger uses him as a forward runner (sometimes as a dummy runner as well). Rodgers wants Henderson to run, dribble and take shots like a number 10 would. 

Rodgers wants those types of midfielders. However, like I suspected when he first came, to do that you need lots of money, because players that fit into that way are of Pogba calibre, one who is a very good all rounder. Not just attacking or defending, but both. Or you need a well oiled and functioning youth system to supply you with it. 

It's hard to find players that are adept and fit into Rodgers' way. That's why Rafa's way was easier. You can find pure defensive midfielders (Mascherano) and pure attacking midfielders (Gerrard) and a specialist forward (Torres). 

I've always said that Rodgers should stick with 3-4-3 for the defensive solidarity it gives him but the 3-4-3 is a lot better with specialist players rather than all-rounders. Unless you have tons of money to spend, it's difficult to acquire them. You have to be really good in the transfer market as well, which we are not.

That's why Milner is good. Because you ask him to defend, he will defend. You ask him to link up, he will do so. You ask him to create or score, he can do that to a capable standard as well. Ditto with Can. He can be used in Midfield or in defence. He pops up with goals and assists too. 

Rodgers believes a player should have more than one skill set, but those types of players are hard to come by, even harder if you don't have the money to do so. That's one gripe I have with Rodgers, in that it took him a long time to figure out that Lucas would be very beneficial to our team. The defensive solidarity he gives is invaluable. Don't get me wrong, it's a great ideal to have, but unless you have a lot of money, you're not going to find players that are superb in one thing and very good in another. It's normally superb in one thing, average in the others - and that for Rodgers isn't acceptable.

If we throw talent aside, if Rodgers could buy either Pogba or Matic, he would choose Pogba simply because Pogba has more than one skill set in that he can attack and defend to a good degree than Matic, who is purely a defensive player.",null,0,null,1434894765,null,0,1434895211,0,csds7on,null,t3_3al4h6,null,t1_csds7on,null,t3_3al4h6,null,null,null,1437232667,null,22,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,22,null

There is no such thing officially as ""The Royal Family"". There is a single person called the monarch who is the individual, who has the right to occupy the coporation-sole known as the Crown. Historically this was literally a physical crown, but in more recent times its the legal entity that has the right to head the judiciary, the legislature and the executive. There isn't even a definition of who is ""in"" the royal family. In a sense we are all members of the royal family, in so much as all humans are related to one another. The name ""Royal Family"" is just a name the media attributes to the famous family... in just the same way as there are other famous families like the Rothschilds, the Arquettes, the Baldwins and the Kardashians.

The monarch (one person - currently Queen Elizabeth) is awarded something called the Sovereign Grant, in exchange for the proceeds of land known as the Crown Estates. There is a substantially smaller arrangement covering the Duchy of Cornwall for the next in line to the throne.

The remainder of the immediate Royal Family do not receive any state funding what-so-ever. If they receive money from the Queen then it is her money to spend as she pleases. If she chooses to spend it on the upkeep of her family, that is her choice. Don't forget though, most members of the Royal Family are hugely successful in their own right. The Prince of Wales was a captain in the Royal Navy, his two sons have both served in the armed forces. His brother Prince Andrew was a search and rescue pilot who saw action in the Falklands war and then turned to business when he left the forces. They are financially successful and independent people.

Everyone behind you has to then slow down and they can't pull out either, exacerbating the problem.

(The only things wrong with the 520 were the poor screen and it only having 512MB of memory which made switching between apps a pain; the construction quality was outstanding, the OS solid and the tiles form the best mobile front end by a mile in my experience).",null,0,null,1434895544,null,0,1434895741,0,csdshgh,null,t3_3allmc,null,t1_csdshgh,null,t3_3allmc,null,null,null,1437232950,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

There have been few rumours of other clubs being in for him. Sure it is a risk that someone else may swoop in and get him but I wouldn't considered that a failure. Being drawn into paying an extra £3,000,000 out of fear and risk aversion could also be seen as failure and weakness. What if we end up £3,000,000 short for a bid on a striker?

-------

&gt; You think it's fair that the rich and powerful don't suffer from austerity?

The ""rich and powerful"" as you called them have contributed more during this recession proportionally than anyone else in the country as study after study has shown. Do they ""suffer"" from it... well that's difficult. If you're on £40k a year and you've seen your pay cut in relative terms by £5-6k then even though you are worse off, you're still earning enough to cover the essentials, even if it means relatively your quality of living has gone down. If you were earning £15k a year and you've seen your pay cut by £500 a year, then even though its proportionally a far smaller amount, it probably makes more difference day to day.

So your question really is this; is that fair? Personally I don't think any of the cuts so far have been unfair. The middle class have carried the burden of the recession and particularly the young working age middle class. In my opinion welfare should be about providing those with the minimum they need to survive a life with some meaning. It shouldn't mean flat screen TVs and 4 bedroom council homes. These are luxuries few young people can afford and I don't see why the state should provide them for those out of work.

null,false,Alwaysfair,null,null,null,"The IFS have this to say about Labour budget deficit.

&gt;In the years leading up to the financial crisis, the UK economy experienced fairly strong,
and extremely stable, growth. As Budget 2008 boasted, ‘Over the past decade, the UK
economy has proved strong and stable, with GDP growth averaging almost 3 per cent a
year and inflation close to the Government’s symmetric inflation target’.4 But despite this,
at the time of the March 2008 Budget, public sector net borrowing in 2007–08 was
thought to have been £36.4 billion or 2.6% of national income.
This level of borrowing was slightly higher than the Labour government was comfortable
with, not least because it required borrowing of no more than about 2% of national
income in order to keep public sector net debt below the ceiling of 40% of national
income that it had set for itself.5 Therefore, the Labour government was planning a fiscal
tightening to reduce borrowing to 1.3% of national income by 2012–13. It intended to
bring this about by increasing public spending less quickly than growth in the economy
(and much less quickly than it had been increased over the previous few years) and
increasing tax receipts slightly as a share of national income (as a result of fiscal drag and
some tax-raising measures, including increases in alcohol duties and vehicle excise duty).
On the face of it, these forecasts suggested that the public finances were in reasonable
shape. At the time of the March 2008 Budget, the Treasury’s estimate of structural
borrowing – that is, the difference between total spending and total revenues after
adjusting for the estimated impact of the ups-and-downs of the economic cycle – was only
slightly more optimistic than that of the OECD or the IMF (see Box 1.1 for a further
discussion). However, the UK’s public finances could have been better prepared for a
potential downturn.
One way of thinking about this is that – after more than a decade of strong growth – the
deficit in the years prior to 2008 had been substantial and debt had grown as a
proportion of national income in every year since it had dipped below 30% of national
income in 2001–02. To believe this was genuinely cautious fiscal management really
would require you to believe that boom and bust had been abolished – as Gordon Brown
claimed on a number of occasions that it had been.    
 

Labour weren't reckless but nor were they sensible in their economic policy.

So for everyone still asking and to set the record straight. Friday was a planned water jump with us landing into the water at Whitehaven Marina, as part of our display like the many others we do every weekend we planned a canopy formation, this means we collide 2 or more canopies together in the air. Anyone that has seen our displays knows that we do this week in week out and we have a very experienced CF team. However sometimes things don't always go as planned. On Friday during this deliberate collision to build a formation one of the canopies deflated and wrapped around the higher guy. After assessing the situation and deeming it to be too low for the lower guy to cut away from they focused on remaining linked together under one good canopy and heading for some clear water to land in. They did the exact correct drills with the lower guy giving dirctions and worked together to steer what they had into a safe area. They then landed into the water as intended but slightly further down the marina. Both guys were totally fine and enjoyed a pie and a pint afterwards. Thanks to the team at Whitehaven for their fast response and for hosting us so well. We are on our way to the Airfield now and are looking forward to today's display in Tadcaster for Victorinox.

If they were to buy such a player, they would as you say adapt a system to include them. Nonetheless, looking at the squad the quality of service other players could provide in terms of crosses seems limited: Henderson, Coutinho &amp; Milner - yes; Markovic, Ibe, Sterling &amp; Lallana - I'm unconvinced. Also, I'd say that Liverpool have tried to in still an ethos of fast paced, possession based football and I see it is more hard set than you believe it to be.

**Grzegorz Krychowiak**: Plays for Sevilla. Purely a defensive midfielder. Highly rated and said to be very good at what he does. Apparently he has a release clause of £21M.

**Jordy Clasie**: Highly rated dutch midfielder. Often referred to as the Dutch Xavi (I know! I know!). He's more of a holding midfielder. Southampton see him as a replacement for Schneiderlin. Good at tackling. Again, quite young (24 years) and wouldn't cost too much.

**Steven N'Zonzi**: Plays for Stoke City. Purely a defensive midfielder. He can do the job. Apparently, Sevilla is interested in signing him (Replacement for Krychowiak?). 

**Illarramendi**: I'm not sure if he's an upgrade over Allen. At that price, I'd rather want us to go for Clasie or Imbula. However, we should try to get him on a loan with an option to buy. Agent Rafa can help us surely.

Basically, you choose the subjects you want to take, ('Level 1/2 Edexcel Certificates' are IGCSE's newer name, but they're still GCSEs, and they're all exam-only) and then contact the college and tell them the names of the papers you want. Each IGCSE is 2 papers, and you can find the papers' names &amp; codes on Edexcel's site. There are lists of subjects offered [here](http://qualifications.pearson.com/en/qualifications/edexcel-international-gcses-and-edexcel-certificates.html) and you can find codes etc.

Chemistry is KCH0 -- composed of two papers, KCH0/1C and KCH0/2C.

Biology is KBI0 --  paper codes are KBI0/1B and KBI0/2B.

Physics is KPH0 --  KPH0/1P and  KPH0/2P.

Etc.

You contact the college and tell them the codes for the exams you want to take (or maybe just ""I want to take Edexcel Cert Biology/Chemistry/etc."" and they'll know) and they sort out all the paperwork and do all the bureaucratic stuff. 

You literally only sit the exam with the school, so revising is entirely your own job. You can get books online, CGP sell IGCSE/Edexcel Certificate books via their site &amp; Amazon.  You *could* pay for help through an outside group like ICS Learn, but they charge £1000s and you still have to sit the exam elsewhere, since they're tuition-only.

They will support this with TV programmes and online resources. No other broadcaster would ever launch such an initiative. (Here's the original press release: http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/make-it-digital).

Another example is the long-running Bitesize education site (http://www.bbc.co.uk/education) - a massive collection of resources for student and teachers.

Regarding the arts, the BBC funds a number of national orchestra's: the BBC National Orchestra of Wales (based in Cardiff), the BBC Scottish Symphony orchestra (based in Glasgow), the BBC Philharmonic (based in Manchester) and the BBC Symphony Orchestra, (based in London). 

Look at the Proms, the world's largest classical music festival that is greatly admired abroad. Where else can you hear a full orchestral performance for just £5? Less than the price of a cinema ticket. You don't even have to buy in advance for the £5 ticket, just turn up (please don't judge the Proms on the Last Night, it's not representative of the rest of the festival). If that doesn't float your boat, which other broadcaster would provide complete coverage of Glastonbury?

If you're a parent, there's also the CBeebies and CBBC sites (and associated programmes). The only advert-free TV programming available. 

Sure, there's an awful lot of rubbish the BBC puts out, but I'm sure some of what I consider rubbish is what others enjoy watching (and vice versa!). I too have concerns about dumbing down, bland and sometimes poor news coverage, but it's still the case that no other broadcaster can match the breadth of the BBC's output.",null,0,null,1434899511,null,0,1434900101,0,csdu2cx,null,t3_3alg0m,null,t1_csdu2cx,null,t1_csdr3jg,null,null,null,1437233818,null,30,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,30,null

That currently comes out at about £2.57 for something Inglot UK charges £5 for.

I don't know whether the VAT rate for makeup in Poland falls under their 8% healthcare goods bracket or their 23% everything-else bracket, but let's say it's the 8%. That would mean that ~13.9zł is the price of the eyeshadow, and VAT is ~1.1zł. If we translate that across to GBP, the price of the eyeshadow is ~£2.40. Add to that our 20% VAT and it comes to £2.88.

Ah, but Inglot UK has a nice shiny flagship store in Westfield. That's not a cheap location. Rent is expensive, staff are expensive, shipping product from Poland to the UK isn't free...

...But it still doesn't sit right with me, knowing we're charged £5 for £3 of goods. Buy a full 10-pan palette and you've lost £20, and that's *if* VAT on eyeshadow in Poland is only 8%. If it's 23% we're being robbed even more thoroughly and we should only be charged around £2.50 per pan.

The fine creates a nice middle ground between court and being let off).

You're also forgetting inflation. The debt is denominated in 2015 pounds, or whichever year it was borrowed in. We'll be repaying(realisticaly, rolling over) in 2035 pounds. Nominal growth, as opposed to real growth, will be substantially higher than the 2.6% so we can expect the debt burden to fall even faster. Over the past 14 years, it's averaged 3.7%. That would mean 40% of GDP. Between 00/01 and 07/08, it averaged 5-ish percent. That kind of nominal GDP growth, with a balanced budget, would see debt fall to 28% of GDP. 


My numbers might be a little off, but I think the general point is there: Nominal GDP growth is important for predicting what the debt burden will look like. I mean, even with the deficit as it is, debt to GDP is predicted to start falling next year. I don't think we're in a position where we need to be overly concerned about the debt burden unless another major economic crisis hits in the next few years.

Smart lab candidates should just wash their hands off the whole sorry mess in the ME - it's not as though Britain can solve anything over there anyway. There are other parts of teh world where people are more needy but not violent and we can focus better on them.

For example, he chose Botswana not South Africa to put in his healthcare money, because a) it was non corrupt (lower corruption than many eastern european countries) and b) it already had a rudimentary healthcare set up and his efforts just plugged into it. From his point of view, his money was limited and he wanted the biggest bang for his buck and Botswana meant less waste (through corruption and maladministration) and more lives saved than South Africa.

I agree with you that he would be better to stay for another season at least and yes, he might fail, but all the signs so far are that he is developing every game. He was a sparrow relying on his pace when he broke into the team, he's now become one of the most important players comfortable in many positions.

It's down to Raheem how much he wants to progress, the talent is definitely there and I hate seeing our fans pretending that he is a no hoper (not saying you were doing that, but I'm seeing a lot of it recently).",null,0,null,1434901306,null,0,false,0,csduuuk,null,t3_3alvg1,null,t1_csduuuk,null,t1_csduog6,null,null,null,1437234342,null,24,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,24,null

I have to disagree, the UK has an aging population which is beginning to bite. Japan one of the world's most innovative and technologically advanced nations has only just managed to stay stagnant over the past 25 years with its aging population. 

&gt;You're also forgetting inflation. The debt is denominated in 2015 pounds, or whichever year it was borrowed in. We'll be repaying(realisticaly, rolling over) in 2035 pounds. Nominal growth, as opposed to real growth, will be substantially higher than the 2.6% so we can expect the debt burden to fall even faster. Over the past 14 years, it's averaged 3.7%. That would mean 40% of GDP. Between 00/01 and 07/08, it averaged 5-ish percent. That kind of nominal GDP growth, with a balanced budget, would see debt fall to 28% of GDP.

Very true


&gt;I don't think we're in a position where we need to be overly concerned about the debt burden unless another major economic crisis hits in the next few years. Even then, we have our own currency so it should be fine.

But debt is still high and it’s higher now than at any time since the late 1960s which could leave less room for manoeuvre when that next inevitable financial crisis comes. The other bigger issue is politics, governments tend not to be strong, they make unfunded pledges to get elected and stay in power, this could mean that the deficit is added to time and time again, pushing debt higher and higher, the USA is a prime example of this although its gets there by slightly different means. If the UK’s debt can be dealt with now when we have both the political will and the means then lets do it before we have a government that doesn’t have either the will or the means.

I drive a work vehicle that's hawked by my boss for breaking the speed limit (GPS tracker). So I set my cruise control or limiter to 70mph - I'm not going to lose sleep over the extra few MPH I could sneak in before a speed gun or the GPS tracker catches on. My job is worth too much to me, and I'm on the firm's time so IDGAF either way.

So I cruise along the motorway; starting in the first lane I quickly come across the first lorry I need to pass. I check my mirror and there's no car right behind me in the second lane so I overtake the lorry.

With the lorry 2+ seconds behind me, I look ahead and see *another* lorry ahead - I'll be within 2 seconds of him in about 10 seconds. In my mirror I see a guy in the distance behind gaining on me; he's about to reach 2 seconds behind me in about the same time it'd take me to be within 2 seconds of the lorry. 

So I stay in the middle lane for those ten seconds, because if I pulled back into the first lane, you can be sure as shit the guy behind me isn't going to join the 3rd lane to let me out in time and it's Mr Brakey Brakey 56mph for me as I get trapped behind the lorry and the guy crawling past me.

So to everyone else hoofing it at 85mph, I look like I'm hogging the lane, and that may be considered the case by some. I do it because people who go above 70mph require more space ahead of them to stop when someone changes lane ahead. I've been flashed and tooted countless times for passing at 70mph two lorries elephant racing by someone behind me because he needs 5 seconds to slow to 70mph for the 95mph he was doing.

I mean I had no confidence going into any game and with the games against strugglers I thought more of the embarrassment of an inevitable loss rather than a good win which is really worrying. I mean I personally don't get the notion of falling out of love with football I can't say I'm in love with it in the first place. I mean I love Everton and watching them play but other teams don't really catch my attention not even Ireland when they're playing cos I've just accepted that there are only about 5 players if that that are actually good and play for Ireland and most of them play for Everton. If there's a big match on id probably watch it but with regards to the champions league or World Cup finals if it was on id watch it but I wouldn't actively anticipate it. 

Next season is really make or break for Martinez and Everton. Realistically and people haven't taken this into consideration if Martinez is sacked it's likely that many players may want to leave.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"**1)** The Palace of Westminster is not, and has never been, the Queens home. It hasn't been a royal residence since 1312 and even then it was a parliamentary debating chamber with royal living quarters for convenience. Buckingham Palace IS a royal residence, but it's also open to tourists and generates income, income she pays tax on. When Windsor Castle (another Royal Residence) got damaged in a fire, she stumped up 70% of the repair bill herself. 

**2)** You don't work harder than the Queen.

**3)** The **Royal Family** doesn't receive any state funding, and doesn't exist to benefit you in any way, any more than my family exists to benefit you. They are simply the family of the monarch, they have jobs and earn money like everyone else. Prince Andrew was a search and rescue pilot, mentioned in dispatches during the Falklands war who then went into business for example - but I'm sure your illustrious professional career exceeds accomplishments like that ;) The name *""Royal family""* is a term used by the media, in precisely the same way *""The Kardashians""* is used. If the Queen helps to maintain her family, then it's her choice how to spend her money and use her properties - and it's none of our fucking business. My grandmother gave me £2000 to help me out while I was at university. Maybe that should have gone to you as well? Since you work so hard and apparently family members shouldn't help other family members

**4)** The **monarch** doesn't exist to benefit you directly either, and if you think they do you don't understand the country you live in - which sounds reasonable since it would explain why you've become so disappointed with your life. The monarch exists to fulfill an important constitutional role as head of state, and that indirectly benefits you. Every country has a head of state. Ours gets chosen at birth based on a complex system of inheritance, and then gets groomed into the role. The advantage is you end up with a head of state whose spent their entire life building (and being built) towards it... the alternative is a system like France or the USA where you end up with a selfish politician, who use their 5-10 years to squeeze every last penny for their own personal aggrandizement.

I just don't get what this law solves in practice. I get that it's neater, and is an extension of dual carriageway rules. But I just don't really see why it matters. The third lane (middle) adds nothing other than capacity, imo. 

Plus if you're in the middle lane you have a lot more options if anything unexpected happens. If your tyre blows or something you have a lot more run off space to either side of you, even though ideally you'll be looking for some hard shoulder sharpish.

That's what cults do. I think saying they didn't need any convincing is ignoring the facts about ISIS. The way cults operate and they way they affect people is clever and insidious. On top of that, I think having your wife go to Saudi Arabia, alone with your children and without you should have rung alarm bells.

A good example would be Nazi germany. Here, we had people who didn't have any issue with Jews or weren't too political en masse turn into rabid psychopaths who supported the death of Millions. Did they change suddenly overnight? Did they suddenly go ""hey, lets all become nazis""? No, they were brainwashed, first by a party and then by a state. Means such as mass propaganda, emotional ties, nationalism and the use of the issues of the day were used to bring people into this cult. Even news of nazi thuggery didn't deter people, because if you are dragged far enough into a cult, you'll dismiss it as ""just opposition lies"".

And that is what's occurring with ISIS. They are targeting disaffected, naive or vulnerable groups, along with people who in part share their ideology, indoctrinating them with this ""wonderland"" image of ISIS, dragging them past the ""it's just lies"" stage and finally, separating them from any challengers to their ideology by getting them over to ISIS held territory where they control everything in a way North Korea would be impressed by. Literally, in ISIS held territory, schools, information, media, communications and resources are controlled by ISIS, just like a cult.

Once you start to see ISIS as a cult, you better understand the problem.",null,1,null,1434904078,null,0,false,0,csdw69j,null,t3_3alzlm,null,t1_csdw69j,null,t1_csdvi8c,null,null,null,1437235073,null,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2,null

Anyway the main reason I think the current governments drive for austerity and a balanced budget is moronic is that with a deeply entrenched trade deficit, running a government surplus means the private sector MUST take on debt (run a deficit), which is likely to cause a private sector debt crisis, and given that our private sector has [barely delivered](http://www.3spoken.co.uk/2015/04/uk-private-debt-levels-q4-2014.html) since the crisis it probably wouldn't take long for this to manifest.  We need the government to continue running a deficit for some time yet to allow private sector balance sheets to repair. I think the current governments spending plans are incredibly stupid and very dangerous and completely ignore national income accounting for some bizarre reason.

The chief dangers, in my opinion, are these:

* that British courts will no longer be permitted to reinterpret British law so that it will be compatible with the ECtHR  
    * this allows the courts to read additional human rights protections into any UK law, so long as that law is not contradictory with those rights, in which case the courts must issue a declaration of incompatibility
    * this ability to read in extra rights to other laws makes the Human Rights Act (HRA) pseudo-constitutional, giving us some of the protections that other citizens enjoy as a fundamental part of their constitutional law
* that human rights will be redefined as citizens' rights and so foreign nationals will lose their protections
* that the bill of rights will only apply to the territory of the UK (it is this selective approach to human rights that allows the US to claim that Guantanamo is legal)
* that the use of human rights law will be restricted to ""serious"" cases

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt; Right, so the best thing would be for us to transfer land and private property (not personal property) into common ownership. Why should the royal family own such vast estates?

I'm confused. First, define the difference between private and personal property. Are you defining private property as buildings and such, and personal property as your personal effects that you have within that building?

Secondly, justify yourself.

My parents own 17 acres of land. They bought it off someone, and I guess if you go back far enough, someone else probably took it from someone by force, before starting a chain of sales that leads to the present day.

By what possible measure do you consider it acceptable to seize their land and put it into common ownership? How about I just walk into your house and announce that I'm going to use your garden to set up a new plant nursery (hey, all land is common property now!).

Similarly, my uncle - a farmer - owns 800 acres or so. The means by which he *earns a living* (oh, and puts food in the supermarket for you to eat. You're welcome). You would put that into common ownership? Why? I know it's very fashionable to wail of people who own 100k acres. But you need to remember the *vast majority* of landowners are working folk.

Unless you are specifically going to pick on a half dozen of the largest landowners and single them out for special treatment, your notion of transferring land into common ownership is nonsense.

null,false,Anandya,null,null,null,"I am 29, I just got my degree last year. I was one of the older people on my course. You aren't too old to learn. 

1. First things First? Don't let Crohn's hold you back. 

2. Get your schooling done. It's going to suck. It really is but you are going to have to fix your mind on it. And work. If you cannot be inspired then do it out of sheer bloody minded stubborness. 

3. Set yourself goals. Then break them down into what needs to be done. Let me give you an example. 

I am a doctor. But I studied abroad. I have to come back home soon. So there is an exam I am dreading. The entire thing is broken down into steps. First? Get IELTS. Second. Study for PLAB (break that down into steps too) Third. Pass PLAB 1, Fourth. Study for PLAB 2, Get Clinical Expeerience in UK Fifth, Plab 2, Fifth More Experience/Get Locum Sixth Find Training Slot to be SHO/F2 in the UK. 

It allows me to set small goals that if I achieve will allow me to move forward and progress. Each is a step that needs to be beaten. 

The reason you fear the journey is you forget that it is just a series of steps. Don't limit yourself. Do what you can and then some more. You will learn what you really can do from that. Too many people have told us that it is okay to give up. 

You must forget this. If there is something you want you must be willing to bleed for it (and in a way you are). Now the question is can you ignore the pain of Crohn's to do it. 

I didn't become a doctor because I was smart or talented. In fact I am very lazy and stupid. I got my degree cause I put up the graft. Because I said that I wanted this more than a social life or things other people take for granted. 

So let's look at your problems. So you want a degree. 

First things first? GCSEs and A-Levels. Admit it. You want one. Admission is the first step. This means that there are no lies that you tell yourself. The honest truth is you want something deniied to you by your health. And that makes you hungry for success. Hungry dogs just need the right motivation to hunt. You got nothing to lose right? So ask. Just go and say it out loud. Let's set aside 2 years for GCSE's and 2 years for A-Levels. That's 4 years. It can be done. Maybe another year to whip yourself into shape and play catch up. I have no idea if you want to do science GCSEs but if you do then I have no idea how you would get access to a lab.

Then you got a degree. 3 to 5 years depending on what you want (I don't know! You may decide to do medicine). There were people who were much older than me doing my course. Age should not be a stigma to learning anything. 

But don't forget to live your life.

As for your pension, even if your employer isn't matching or beating your contributions then it's still worthwhile. Remember that pensions aren't tax free, they're tax deferred, you get the tax back when the contribution is made but you have to pay tax on your pension when it comes to starting drawdown, on anything above 25% of the value of the pension. They're great for people who might not be able to rely on themselves to make a payment in to one of their savings accounts regularly as you would set up a direct debit to do this automatically, and for people who can't trust themselves not to take money out of a more readily accessible savings account because you can't touch anything in your pensions until you hit retirement age, but from what you're both already putting aside it doesn't sound like you would have either problem. Since you're employer isn't paying in to them and you're both basic rate tax payers the main benefit over an ISA is compound interest on that extra 20% a year that you get as a tax reclaim. Over 30 years or so that can be significant even taking account of the tax that you have to pay back.

If you do get a pension then you can avoid risk (for the most part) depending on your pension provider by putting the pension money in to government bonds, either directly through a SIPP or a government bond fund through a pension provider.

aka ""I like it so everyone should pay for it"".

Essential public services are those that without which the country would crumble. We need roads, we need schools, we need hospitals, etc. We do not need the BBC. It is a nice to have.

&gt; They're the only channel who produce quality content that is reliable and educational. 

They also produce a lot of shit - and there's the argument that they have monopolised certain areas because of their guaranteed funding. Why should anyone else do it because the BBC is doing it?

&gt; Plus, for all the people in these arguments that say it ""does nothing for them"", it still usually provides the most-watched programming of every week.

Value is personal. It doesn't matter if it produces the ""most watched programming"" if that person does not watch it.

&gt; I have such a fear that arguments like yours will take the BBC down.

There are 25 million TV licences (including licences to businesses) and 26m households. Most people choose to pay for the BBC. Offering an opt out, as the TV licence has always done, gives people the best of both worlds.

No government is going to shut down the BBC, and I'd bet a good sum of money that no government would dare do anything to drastically affect its funding. 

&gt; the BBC is the only thing I watch. The thought of it disappearing sort of scares me

Again, you want to keep the BBC because you like it. Others will disagree.

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt; I think there are two confusions here. The first is the confusion over what is meant by property. When we talk about properties, we're not talking about the stuff you own for personal use or consumption, we're talking about the fact that the royal family own vast estates for no other reason than luck of birth. **Most people in this country don't own private property.**

Actually, 65% of UK households are either owned outright or under mortgage - the householders do indeed own private property.

Also, luck of birth? So what? My uncle owns 800 acres through ""luck of birth"" that he inherited from my grandfather. It's a decent chunk of land. Not a huge estate, but enough to earn a good living from. My grandfather built up the farm from around 150acres when he started out, expanding it with the fruits of his own hard graft. Are you saying my grandfather was not entitled to pass the fruits of his labours on to his children?


&gt; The second confusion is as to how those properties were acquired, and what constitutes entitlement. You don't have to be a socialist (although I am) to recognise that the Queen's ownership of land is not down to some sort of 'free and fair exchange'. The things I own, which is only personal property - I own no private property - I own because I've had to work and purchase them. So the question of entitlement is not as clear-cut as you seem to want it to be.

My grandfather worked his ass off to grow a small amount of land (150acres is not a big farm to run a dairy herd on) into a decent sized concern.

You have stated elsewhere that ""the best thing"" would be to take land and private property in common ownership, and that entitlement vaires. Which is odd, because what you're saying is that you'd like to seize my uncle's land from him. If my grandfather had spent his money on a collection of sports cars instead of expanding the farm, then you would not seize them - because they are personal, moveable property.

I'm very confused as to why you feel private property is in some way different to personal property. That in your quest to redistribute wealth it would be fair to seize land, but not a collection of classic sports cars?",null,0,null,1434907297,null,0,false,0,csdxr7p,null,t3_3al72e,null,t1_csdxr7p,null,t1_csdqyfb,null,null,null,1437236165,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Nuremberg Set a Valid Precedent for Iraq War Trials

As the number of deaths continues unabated in Iraq –the worst since 2008- so do calls for the prosecution of those that led both the United States and Great Britain into war, George W. Bush and Tony Blair. In December alone there were 44 deaths in just one day, over 766 for the whole month and over 9,200 civilian deaths in the whole year. If Nuremberg Principles were applied, both Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair would have probably been condemned for their role in the Iraq war.

The Nuremberg Principles, a set of guidelines established after World War II to try Nazi Party members, were developed to determine what constitutes a war crime. The principles can also be applied today when considering the conditions that led to the Iraq war and, in the process, to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, many of them children, and to the devastation of a country’s infrastructure.

In January 2003, a group of American law professors warned President George W. Bush that he and senior officials of his government could be prosecuted for war crimes if their military tactics violated international humanitarian law. The group, led by the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights, sent similar warnings to British Prime Minister Tony Blair and to Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.

Although the United States is not part of the International Criminal Court (ICC), U.S. officials could be prosecuted in other countries under the Geneva Convention, says Michael Ratner, president of the Center for Constitutional Rights. Ratner likened the situation to the attempt by Spanish magistrate Baltazar Garzón to prosecute former Chilean military dictator Augusto Pinochet when Pinochet was under house arrest in London.

Both former President George W. Bush and senior officials in his government could be tried for their responsibility for torture and other war crimes under the Geneva Conventions. Should the Nuremberg Principles be followed by an investigating tribunal former President Bush and other senior officials in his administration could be tried for violation of fundamental Nuremberg Principles.

In 2007, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, then ICC’s chief prosecutor, told The Sunday Telegraph that he could envisage a scenario in which both British Prime Minister Tony Blair and then President Bush faced charges at The Hague.

Perhaps one of the most serious breaches of international law by the Bush administration was the doctrine of “preventive war.” In the case of the Iraq war, it was carried out without authorization from the U.N. Security Council in violation of the U.N. Charter, which forbids armed aggression and violations of any state’s sovereignty except for immediate self-defense.

As stated in the U.S. Constitution, international treaties agreed to by the United States are part of the “supreme law of the land.” “Launching a war of aggression is a crime that no political or economic situation can justify,” said Justice Jackson, the chief U.S. prosecutor for the Nuremberg Tribunal.

Benjamin Ferencz, also a former chief prosecutor for the Nuremberg Trials, declared that “a prima facie case can be made that the United States is guilty of the supreme crime against humanity — that being an illegal war of aggression against a sovereign nation.”

The conduct and the consequences of the Iraq war are subsumed under “Crimes against Peace and War” of Nuremberg Principle VI, which defines as crimes against peace “(i) Planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances; (ii) Participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the acts mentioned under (i).” In the section on war crimes, Nuremberg Principle VI includes “murder or ill-treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas, killing of hostages, plunder of public or private property.”

The criminal abuse of prisoners in U.S. military prisons in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo are clear evidence of ill-treatment and even murder.

As for the plunder of public or private property, there is evidence that even before the war started, members of the Bush administration had already drawn up plans to privatize and sell Iraqi property particularly that related to oil.

Although there are obvious hindrances to trying a former U.S. president, a Bristish Prime Minister and their associates, such a trial is fully justified by legal precedents such as the Nuremberg Principles and by the extent of the toll in human lives that that breach of international law has exacted.",null,0,null,1434908346,null,0,false,0,csdy9yp,null,t3_3alfs9,null,t1_csdy9yp,null,t1_csdtxqf,null,null,null,1437236446,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

1. Each vote you cast is worth one (1) point, you can vote like this once a day until the voting closes on July 5.

There are a few ways to cast additional votes:

2. Every time you vote you can share your support on Twitter. When you do this, you give your favorite player an extra 10 points.
3. You can also give them more points by playing FIFA 15. When you vote for your player through the portal, you will be given the option to link your Origin ID. Once linked, actions you perform in FIFA 15 will go towards your player.

Points earned through FIFA 15:


 .5 point for every game you play in FIFA 15, regardless of mode


.5 point for every game you win in FIFA 15, regardless of mode


.25 point for every goal you score in FIFA 15, regardless of mode


Points from in-game play are rewarded regardless of the clubs, players or modes you choose.

A lot of Proms attendees consider the standing-room arena to be the best place in the Royal Albert Hall. The music sounds better here than in other places in the auditorium. You're closer to the orchestra and on less busy concerts you can get quite close to the conductor and musicuans. A lot closer than many of the people in more expensive seats. Or you can go all the way up to the gallery (standing room too) and get a magnificent birds-eye view of the entire auditorium from above (all for £5 too, although the music sounds a bit more distant at the top).

The whole point of the £5 tickets is that you don't have to pre-book an evening if you don't want to, you can just turn up and queue. 

The cost of Last Night tickets is not a reflection of the cost of going to the Proms. It's one night from a music festival that lasts two months; and it's not surprising given the demand for the Last Night that it's treated differently (and more expenisvely) from the other concert performances.

No. Assuming that the local network is not suffering from congestion (or ""overutilisation"" in Virgin speak), then you may get the speed you have paid for. There is no speed/distance issue, but there are others that BT's network does not have.

They like to make us think we have an option not to pay it, but like i said, if we don't we get harassed and intimidated. 
The thing is, the BBC have been making cut backs left right and centre, especially to their programming &amp;amp; presenters. 
They cant compete and cant afford to continue paying mega wages in this climate.
Read the article below about how much they have made cut backs, all while other channels steal talent off them. 
Its not financially viable, and more &amp;amp; more people dont want to pay a tv licence. Im pretty sure they could make more money through advertisements than they do on the licence fee, every other channel copes this way, so why cant they?
My opinion is why does the BBC get special treatment compared to all other channels. TV's and access to channels has flown forward compared to when the BBC started. 
The BBC needs to move with the times, scrap the tv licence and advertise like all other channels. Become more competitive and stop relying on the tv licence to keep them afloat.

&gt;Of course, in the US, the time zone and proximity to host country Canada obviously helps – particularly with television ratings and travelling fans respectively – but the country’s enthusiasm for the Women’s World Cup stretches much farther back than just this summer.

And in a pre-cable age the 1999 Women’s World Cup final between the USA and China was watched by a staggering viewership of 17,975,000.

&gt;But how much of that is down to the success of the USWNT - and how much of it is down to the country’s consumerist culture? How big a part do sponsors play in the regard of the Women’s World Cup in respective territories?

I thought it is now a legal requirement for employers to provide a pension scheme? 

ISA interest rates are usually not that great. Remember that 1-2% interest rates are just enough to offset inflation but not enough to grow your savings. 

If your mortgage interest rate is low, you might get a better return in investing in a private pension fund. You can choose a mix of funds that matches your risk appetite. 

Unfortunately, at your age, you shouldn't bank on the stage pension being enough to sustain you when you get to retirement age.

I think Sterling has broken the bond between the fans and the club, and he should leave otherwise it would be very awkward next season, but Man City badly need English talent and Sterling and Walcott are the only 2 that fit the bill (English, would move, would fit into the system, scores goals).

But a lot of the time lane hoggers simply seem incapable of judging speeds and distances. Loads of drivers don't notice when the vehicle ahead speeds up and the gap begins widening while they're still sitting in the middle lane. Maybe they'll speed up as well, in the mentality of ""I'm in the overtaking lane, I was going to overtake you, I'm committed now,"" but won't go faster than the vehicle ahead because they're both doing the speed limit. Or maybe they just don't notice, and fall further and further back, daydreaming about what they're going to order from BK at the next service station. What starts as a simple overtake manouver becomes an on-the-fly decision to keep going until they pass a second/third vehicle, and mutates into an oblivious lane hog with a huge clear stretch of road to his/her left, and the vehicle they're ""overtaking"" is a speck on the horizon. 

Obviously there's no problem with waiting to overtake another vehicle not far ahead of the first one, that happens all the time. It's just that a lot of lane hogs are bad drivers who don't realise they're actually causing an obstruction. They fully *intend* to overtake but just have zero awareness of when it's more appropriate to pull back in. It's like they make a decision in their head then stick with it like a bungee jumper.

To claim for unfair and/or wrongful dismissal (two different things) you need (as the name suggests) to have been dismissed. However, the law recognises that sometimes you are not fired but are instead given no real choice but to resign. Therefore, you can still make a claim for wrongful or unfair dismissal but state the *manner* of your dismissal was constructive. 

Constructive dismissal is quite hard to establish, plus you then need grounds for unfair/wrongful dismissal. You can resign on notice as you have done and still have been constructively dismissed, but it undermines the argument (often easier if you have literally had to walk out the building). It also depends on what your letter says etc.

Do talk to a lawyer if you want, but I'm just pointing out constructive dismissal is a term thrown around a lot, but something that is legally very difficult to establish.

An alternative is to take the SysAdmin route, but you'll have to learn Linux, Bash and Python (eventually some C too) or Windows Server and Powershell depending on what your employer runs. If you go down the Linux road then I advise learning some Ruby because DevOps is becoming mainstream and is where the real money is. Read a bit about Chef and Puppet.

So they're owned by banks, then. Regardless, personal property can be considered property used personally for ones own needs and consumption. Your house could be considered personal property.

&gt; Are you saying my grandfather was not entitled to pass the fruits of his labours on to his children?

I'm saying his children shouldn't have been entitled to inherit it. I'm saying that inheritance is inherently unjust. Just to be clear, though, I'm not saying that abolition of inheritance is a workable policy in our current society, and I'm not saying people should begrudge your uncle for his inheritance or your grandfather for bequeathing the property. The nature of the system we live under means that leaving your children something to live off is the sensible and right thing to do. It just isn't just.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"It really depends on the degree to be honest. I've been to university twice. The first time was 2005-08 before the financial crisis, and the climate was somewhat different then. It was possible for example to get a degree in a broad subject like English Literature or an unaccredited Psychology degree (which were very popular then) and walk into a generic ""graduate training program"" without too much trouble. You'd be looking at starting salaries for those of around £18-22k at the time. You didn't need much industrial experience and indeed many graduates had absolutely no paid work experience.

These days those type of degrees have a rougher-ride. If your degree is like that then start working on the CV early, get some paid or unpaid experience whilst at university if you can. Industrial placement/sandwich years are now a really good idea. They massively bulk up your CV - effectively giving you the appearance of someone who hasn't just strolled, doe-eyed out of 16 years of education.

If you've got a degree that is relevant to an industrial field then that makes life a lot easier. My first degree was in biochemistry. These sorts of degrees have established routes to employment, either through state employers like the NHS, police forensics etc. or the big industry employers like GSK, Pfizer etc. Similarly if you have a degree in maths, finance etc. then the big employers have well established graduate entry routes. If you have a degree in a professional field like nursing, veterinary science, biomedical science, teaching etc. then again you'll be looking at established routes to employment which you'll begin whilst still at university. 

Don't forget there are also lots of graduate opportunities in everything from the officer roles in the Armed Forces to the intelligence services, government departments etc. Obviously some of these involve a lot more commitment than others.

Anyway, having spent the better part of 8 years in universities and now working what I would say is this; The graduate employment situation is a lot better now than it was in 2009-10 when picking up a graduate job was very competitive, and you'd statistically most likely be looking at a year or two of retail/pub/unskilled work. The prospects for employment are good with the right degrees, and ""okay"" for generic degrees. The situation has changed dramatically since pre-2008 and there is more emphasis now on industrial experience but overall there is work out there. Rather than spend time getting sucked up with ""what-ifs"" you'd be better off investing time into building a broad CV with industry experience if you can get it, volunteering and any extra things you can do. Standing over the crowd can be tricky these days so start early.

You'll generally want to contact them around September -- explain the qualifications you want to sit and confirm they'll accept you for them. They'll either sort it out then and there, or they'll get back to you around January/February. Regarding revision: I'd order books and start revising as soon as possible, don't leave it to the last minute. The fees vary, you can confirm with the school, but anything from £10-30 per subject seems normal, usually around £20. Sometimes an additional fee for administrative stuff. All in all I'd say you'll spend like £300, but I can't say for sure. 

The school is the one responsible for dealing with the exam board (Edexcel) and arranging the papers to be sent and giving you a Unique Candidate Identifier (if you don't already have one) and other stuff. Really all you need to do is make sure you tell them the exam paper codes, and make sure you revise and get to the exam on time. 

Oh also, to clarify: Edexcel offer two kinds of IGCSEs: one kind just called 'IGCSE' (it might say 'IGCSE from 2011/2009') and another kind called Edexcel Certificate Level 1/2. Both the Edexcel Cert &amp; 'IGCSE' are IGCSEs -- the exact academic equivalent to GCSEs. The Edexcel Certs are all exam-only (no coursework), except the English Edexcel Cert, which does have some coursework. To get around that, you can do the IGCSE English (which *does* have no coursework) but make all other subjects Edexcel Certs, so you don't have to do any coursework at all.

It's all confusing, I know. Spend some time looking around Edexcel's site and getting your head around everything, it'll help a lot. Again, if you have any questions feel free to PM.

Markovic has been one of my personal picks to kind of pick up where Sterling could leave off but it's not quite a like for like swap. He doesn't have the same pace and neither of them are extremely technical but Marko has been played out of position so often that I really doubt we've even seen a portion of what he has to offer. 

The one thing that truly excites me about us the past few seasons is our depth (in some areas, at least). Let's face it, a like for like with Sterling is almost as tough as the Suarez situation, simply because of Sterling's age and incredibly high ceiling damn near irreplaceable. But we do have quite a few young lads who could maybe, eventually step up to his current level and potential surpass it. 

I'm honestly just tired of ""eventually"" and ""maybes"". I really do think we should buy for NOW but let's face it, there aren't any big name strikers/wingers looking at us right now so we have to make a splash in the transfer market.

Environmental Health will just send polite letters because doing anything else requires actually doing their job.

**Here's the trick**: when you call up the non-emergency number, **ask for a crime reference number**. You might have to ask a couple times, but you are allowed to report anything you feel requires police attention (illegal or not), and get a crime reference number. They are forced to log it, and will record it as a domestic disturbance or similar.
Once you do this a few times and establish a pattern - and it'd be wise to get neighbours to do the same - handing over a list of crime reference numbers to Environmental Health give them a heart attack (because this is how their performance is tracked), and will make them drop their usual ""keep a noise diary"" bullshit and get straight onto the track of filing an injunction - which is what you need to make this stop permanently.

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt; No, that's not what I'm saying at all. I'm saying that the principle of inheritance is an unjust principle. The alternative to passing down a business to your children is not the dissolution of that business. It can be sold off **or taken under new management, can't it?**

But not by the owner's children apparently. Which makes no sense.

The government are going to seize it and sell it on to the highest bidder? Or the owner would be forced to sell it off under law?

That's easily remedied - owner hires their child as a board member, the board extends them a company loan which they use to buy the company. Former owner pays off the company loan on behalf of their child.

Child bought the company, didn't inherit it. Government seizure avoided and a socking great middle finger is pointed in your general direction.

What you're proposing is a 100% Inheritance Tax. This is fundamentally unworkable because people will simply transfer their wealth into things that aren't ""Private Property"", and pass that on to their kids. Government receipts would *fall*, because rather than people begrudgingly paying their current 40% bill (on anything over £325k), they will actively seek to avoid that tax by some manner. They will dissolve or sell the company and shunt their wealth to their kids as personal property. All those cheques for £10-50k Inheritance Tax add up.

People aren't going to spend a lifetime building up a business with the intention of not passing it's value on to their kids. It's fundamentally incompatible with capitalism - people won't strive to build something up if they know the government is going to take not just a cut as tax, but the whole damn thing.

Unless you live in a fully communist society where everyone works for a state corporation and you neither want nor expect people to start their own business, it's not going to work.

Why am I going to bother building up something great if I or my progeny won't be allowed to enjoy the fruits of my labour?

The problem is you're bringing a sledgehammer to crack a walnut.

You're very upset about a handful of individuals owning vast tracts of property, which is perhaps not unreasonable, and to address that you're proposing to obliterate the concept of inheritance.

The problem you face is that more than 65% of the country are set to inherit some reasonable sum of money - not millions but a portion of £150-500k, and with the way house prices are going, a lot of even quite modest estates are worth £400-500k.

You're proposing to seize the property not just of a handful of major landowners, but of 65% of the population. Funnily enough, popular revolutions generally need to be *popular*, and this wouldn't be.

&gt; You draw it somewhere depending on the value and extent of the inheritance.

Which is an admisison that you have *no idea*.

800 acres could be considered equivalent to a small shop, if not in cash value, then in the ability for someone to derive a living from it. So is 1200 acres the equivalent of a large shop?

You seem to be saying that some people have more than you think it is fair and you think it should be redistributed, which is a position I have sympathy. But clearly you cannot deny that taking away the means by which someone earns a living is in itself unjust and stands against every basic human right going.

A farmer dies, and so you would deny him the right to pass that on to his kids. Not quite sure what would happen to his widow, seeing as you've just seized the farm from her. The kids won't have any money to buy a new farm if they wanted to go into farming so they're what, homeless? There are lots of farms where the son lives in a cottage and labours on the farm whilst they wait to inherit. If they can't inherit and the property is seized or sold off, then you're giving away *their* home as well as their parent's home!

Of course they'd have used a legal fiction to avoid the tax, so it's all irrelevant.",null,0,null,1434914661,null,0,1434915775,0,cse1fmd,null,t3_3al72e,null,t1_cse1fmd,null,t1_csdzzhf,null,null,null,1437238407,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,lgf92,eng-northumberland,Land of the Sausage Roll,null,"The training contract is the standard qualification route for people wanting to go into law as a solicitor. You *can* fund your own qualifications, but it's expensive (up to £25,000 if you need both legal qualifications) and risky as there's no guarantee of a job at the end. 

There are two relevant qualifications: if you have a QLD (qualifying law degree) you just take the Legal Practice Course (LPC), which is the standard UK solicitors' qualification course. If you don't have a law degree, you take the Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL) as well, which is effectively a law degree compressed into one frenetic year.

You then do two years of training in practice at a law firm and you will be admitted to the rolls of the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) as a solicitor. 

All a training contract is is basically an exclusive agreement between you and a law firm that they will cover your GDL/LPC fees and employ you for two years on the potential that you will be retained by them after the end of your traineeship - it's how they recruit graduate lawyers. 

If you go on any mid-sized to large law firm's website and look at their careers/graduate sections all the information is there. You usually go through a long application form and occasionally a telephone interview, then a four-to-six hour assessment and interview day at their offices, and if they like you they'll make you an offer at the end of things.

However it's pretty competitive as a lot of people want to go into law: I read somewhere that some firms get 40-60 applicants for each place they have.

Management and ownership are not the same thing.

&gt; The government are going to seize it and sell it on to the highest bidder? Or the owner would be forced to sell it off under law?

Well, no, it depends doesn't it? I'm not proposing a specific policy plan for inheritance. What I've said is that inheritance is unjust, and that I think it's obscene that the royal family own so much estate. I believe we should remedy that by taking it from them. I'm not saying we should abolish all inheritance. In fact, I just made the point that such a policy would be unworkable under our current political and economic system.

&gt; What you're proposing is a 100% Inheritance Tax.

Nope, see above.

&gt; People aren't going to spend a lifetime building up a business with the intention of not passing it's value on to their kids.

What you're suggesting is absurd. You're suggesting that people build up businesses to bequeath them to their offspring. You're suggesting this is the main motivating force behind capitalism. In China, the government nationalises companies when they reach a certain size and have a certain weight in the balance of the economy. This doesn't stop people building their businesses. People build businesses to earn a living, because they have a good idea, for any number of reasons.

&gt; Unless you live in a fully communist society where everyone works for a state corporation and you neither want nor expect people to start their own business, it's not going to work.

Now we're moving onto a misunderstanding of communism, where innovation disappears. I agree with you, though, that under our current system, complete abolition of inheritance is unworkable - I said as much above.

&gt; You're proposing to seize the property not just of a handful of major landowners, but of 65% of the population. Funnily enough, popular revolutions generally need to be popular, and this wouldn't be

A rule of thumb is that if traffic cops point a speedgun at you, they're not going to chase after you unless you're significantly over the limit - ACPO guidelines is speed limit + 10% + 2, but they'll often not bother unless you're going more than 9mph over. Basically they're deployed to catch people driving dangerously fast, so chasing after someone who's just barely breaking the limit wastes time and might make them miss a bigger fish. Course, they have targets to meet so some days that's irrelevant.

Automated speed traps, ie. cameras &amp; vans, however, are set with a hard limit which probably depends on the type of camera and where it's being used, not all of them have a margin of error so it's russian roulette if you're pushing into 10% + 2 territory when you pass one of those. You might be able to argue the ticket in court if it's only a couple MPH over the limit but no idea if you'd win unless the camera was slightly miscalibrated.

It should be in the interest of everyone that a media organisation not ran for profit exists - it keeps everyone in check and maintains a level of quality that it forces competitors to compete with.

The BBC is nationally and internationally regarded as the premier UK (and one of the best in the world) media organisation for a good reason.

You may not use it yourself, but it is necessary that it is funded. I do not use the military, and would gladly it be reduced immensely. However, I understand not everyone agrees with that, and that it serves an essential function (even if one I do not agree with).

We laugh at these upsell schemes because we can see through them, but I can imagine so many older members of my family falling for them and forking out an extra £80 unnecessarily, and that's when it stops being funny.

I can't help but feel sorry for the staff, many of which probably took the job thinking they will just be able to help people with technical stuff, only to find that the biggest element of the job is aggressive sales pitching. Sales environments are very demoralising to work in with constant pressure from management.

null,false,Firefox7275,null,null,null,"Micronutrients work synergistically and in opposition, **it can do more harm than good to randomly supplement.** Any supplement regime should be tailored to the individual by a registered dietician or other appropriately qualified health professional who has access to your medical history. It should consider age/ gender, activity level, diet, medical conditions, prescribed medication, hormone status (pregnancy/ breastfeeding/ menopause), and other factors.

My own supplements consider all of the above since I am qualified to degree level in lifestyle healthcare. **My family doctor is fully aware of what I take and the dermatologist will be as of next week.** The medical conditions that I take into consideration are dermatological (rosacea/ atopic eczema/ contact dermatitis), immune and mental health.

I need to take a number of supplements: the key ones for **MY** health issues are B group vitamins (prescribed), magnesium and triple strength fish oils. I am hoping to switch cetirizine (antihistamine) for quercetin (mast cell stabiliser, antioxidant) if the dermatologist sanctions that. I should be taking freeze dried probiotics because I have had two lots of antibiotics this year but I keep forgetting. Skin/ hair/ nails products make me cringe, I would never use them and never recommend them.

Diet tips: **Research then consistently meet or exceed the official healthy living guidelines.** I literally cannot remember the last time I saw a new nutrition client who had the basics in place, we are talking years not months.

Guidelines often ignored include oily fish (up to four servings a week), eat a wide variety of different foods (so not processed wheat three times a day), sugary/ fatty/ processed/ junky foods to comprise *maximum* 10% daily calories (a TINY serving, includes many breakfast cereals), serving sizes of muscle meat (size and thickness of the palm).

It is worth noting that many countries advocate seven to nine servings of fruit and veg in line with the published research - the UK lags behind with *at least* five a day. IME most people fail to eat the rainbow (blue/ purple, dark green, red, yellow/ orange).

**Do not cut out entire food groups without medical supervision**, this is restrictive rather than adhering to the variety guideline. The official guidelines work synergistically to supply a balance of all the nutrients we need for health, if we have to drop one (eg. allergies) we need to increase other foods to compensate: this is a specialist task to avoid causing or worsening other imbalances.",null,0,null,1434919515,null,0,1434920371,0,cse3ux0,null,t3_3amt1q,null,t1_cse3ux0,null,t3_3amt1q,null,null,null,1437240062,null,2,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,2,null

But it can be managed, particularly when there are resources in the economy which are not being used productively (notably labour).

To put it another way, one of the main causes of inflation is demand (in the form of money) outpacing supply. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation#Causes):

&gt;'Demand-pull theory states that inflation accelerates when aggregate demand increases beyond the ability of the economy to produce (its potential output).

Relatively high levels of unemployment suggest that we have output to spare, and if these people can become more productive through government spending it will cause further economic growth (leading to more output and, in turn, less inflation).",null,0,null,1434920446,null,0,1434922035,0,cse4bd7,null,t3_3alk0n,null,t1_cse4bd7,null,t1_cse38t1,null,null,null,1437240504,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,RedofPaw,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"Sure, and that's a fair enough point, but it doesn't really go to why the sum they do receive cannot be renegotiated. The amount the monarchy receives could be reduced. That could be negotiated. Sure, she could easily turn around and revoke the agreement made, but she is not going to prompt a constitutional crisis for the sake of a small change in circumstance.

Your point again is a good one. The argument about the monarchy is pretty sound - they bring in more than they take. It would be foolish to let ideological reasons cut off that revenue stream - one that does more good than harm.

But let's also not pretend there is anything 'fair' about the situation. Let's not pretend that the benefit those within the monarchy receive is not something that COULDN'T be cut without consequence. Let's not pretend that the country's prize revenue stream would suddenly run dry if the royal family was forced to endure a teeny tiny reduction in their standards of living. 

A cut could happen. It would not have to involve a cut in standards for the monarchy and everything they represent could be maintained. But the will from those in a position to make those 'cuts' is not there. There will be no protests in the street, so why should politicians rock the boat? No... of course they won't. 

The mantra of 'all in it together' is of course bullshit, and no one seriously believes it is anything but PR. Austerity meanwhile is 'good' and 'moral'. Better balance those books! Oh... but not over there... besides - we get more in than they take out.

Meanwhile, any cuts made to the monarchy would be purely symbolic. There would simply not be enough money raised to make any meaningful impact on public finances. 

Yet, they WOULD be symbolic. A government could combine them with cuts to MP benefits. They could come out and say: ""look, we're absolutely in this together... those who 'have' also receive cuts.""

But of course that doesn't happen. Because it IS symbolic. It promotes an ideology that is at odds with the 'scrounging layabouts' narrative we hear. It implies those who have wealth perhaps have too much. It is at odds with the beliefs of those in a position to change the situation. 

So no. The monarchy will not be cutting their cut.

There are many media organisations, there is no ""essential function"" of the bbc, nothing that cannot be performed by other media organisations. For instance, HBO has been producing tv drama superior to anything the bbc has produced in years and they did it without a tv tax.

Look up your local access to HE course. They're great. They are pretty damn flexible when it comes to chronic illnesses, and the way it's usually structured is pretty intensive but also puts you in really good stead for university. Basically, if you can manage your illness during an Acess course, you can manage it during a uni degree. 

For an access course, you WILL need some form of GSCE type thing, but they will train you up and get you the qualification during the access course, or at least mine did for some people. There were some really smart people there who didnt know basic math, but they stuck with it and managed to get their GSCE's (or whatever theyre called) in a few months, in conjunction with the access course. It might be worth doing a part time one if you do this though, as it can be very intensive, the people I know who were studying for the GCSE's were pretty stressed a lot of the time. I had the same experience as many of the other access guys posting in here though, lots of people, of many different walks of life, and intelligence, just trying to better themselves, its a really nice atmosphere to be in. 

If you choose to go down this route, I suggest picking something you are interested in. Fuck trying to get a qualification. Do it because you want to. I chose Archaeology, because I was interested, and now im genuinely considering a career in it despite my chronic illnesses which would force me to volunteer/work part time. 

From my experience with universities, humanities degrees are often a lot more forgiving than other courses for chronic illnesses. I suggest making an appointment with the universities disability adviser before going, and seeing what they say. I chose archaeology in York because of the course and the fantastic team they have there, and even though I'm having trouble finishing my degree now, theyre being more than helpful and I'm confident I will finish it. 

Some degrees look down a little on Access course qualifications, but I found Hull uni (fantastic history department!) and York uni incredibly helpful and clearly wanted me to go there. If you ever feel put off by the university because of their manner on disabilities, DONT GO, you can find one that appreciates how hard you are working to be there. 

Last note, make SURE you make the university know you have a chronic illness, make sure you are getting disabled students allowance. Even if you dont use the money, the fact you have the allowance shows the university you do actually have an illness, and I have found from personal experience with friends who chose not to get it, that they are far more understanding with students who have DSA.

One of them failed the safety standards audit necessary to import drugs into the EU and so overnight the potential stocks of material they could buy were halved. The other factory was being hauled over the coals by the USFDA and so a lot of money and time was spent making sure they were in shape for their upcoming EU certification of suitability because if they failed it, the company I worked for would suddenly be out of suppliers for their drug. Pharmaceuticals especially are incredibly highly-regulated and it's not so easy to just switch from one supplier to another because of all the paperwork and safety compliance tests that need to be done. 

You don't know what's going to happen to a supplier so it's best to have a handful of separate sources in case somebody fails a safety audit, goes bankrupt, burns down etc. On the other hand, it is inefficient to have many different suppliers for one thing.

So far there have been a handful of British people killed by ISIS. A very serious threat, no doubt, but no more so than many other threats we face.

There are loads of courses and tutorials out there to self-teach many languages, though I can't help you much further than that as I don't know what other skills might be needed to net you a programming job or something.

From what I know (I'm going to be doing a CompSci degree in just over a year hopefully, so I've done research on the subject, but I'm not qualified in any way) maths is pretty important to programming. I don't know the best way to learn maths without a standard education, but I'm sure there are  many online courses (though there is a lot of material to cover to get to GCSE/A-Level level).

You might want to try to get into a university/college that will be able to teach you what you are missing, or get a tutor or something who could teach you the stuff.

You could learn enough on your own and net a job with those skills (though I can imagine it will be hard without formal qualifications, if you show that you are motivated and know your stuff, you should be able to find something), or try to get back into formal education and go the more standard route, just a few years later than most.

Seems like I matched a long post with a long reply, but if you have any more questions, I'd love to help you if I can (I'm currently studying maths, further maths, physics and IT at a-level by the way, if you want any specific advice relating to them).

Good luck with whatever you choose to pursue, and feel free to keep us updated and ask more questions if you want to :)

I was in a very similar situation except without the 2.2 part. 
Applying for a job at a young age I was, to be honest, very little to put on my CV for obvious reasons. 

My advice would be that sometimes even if they do not seem directly related, they can be in some way. Your previous experiences may have shown some skills, work ethic and determination and ability to learn new things etc so even if not directly relevent it could be.

I would also say a 2.2 at a top 5 uni is worth more than a 2.1 in certain circumstances so I wouldn't necessarily (but I do totally undertstand) your concern. 2.2 from Oxford for example is worth more than a 2.1 from elsewhere for a lesser course (coming from somebody with a 2.1.)

What kind of jobs are they too, again you may have done small things in your life that may become more relevent and you can actually put down.
Eg if you were involved in something at uni, a club or maybe taught younger students , acted as a mentor or whatever these things may seem minor but when your in our position listing things like this do help bulk out your CV and I think employers know that young people will not have had dozens of jobs so will put down stuff like this.

Basically consider everything you have done and think how can this be used to market myself  - playing a musical instrument, sports to a high level or anything. Hell you wouldn't think it was related but you got points on junior doctors applications for music performance at one point!

However in this specific case the police identified a family with connections to ISIS, a group with is a specific threat to both this country and the people in it. Moreover in this case the police have been proved to be right, as members of the family proceeded to join ISIS, who need I remind you are killing and opressing a large part of the middle-east.

What is being debated is the order in which these events occurred -- the causual connection. Did the intervention of the police force lead to or push these persons towards ISIS? Or where they already on that path anyway? It is an issue that I feel deserves at least some investigation, given it is not the first time such criticisms have been raised. 

From my own investigations, I have found there is widespread disdain and mistrust when it comes to the PREVENT programme. If we're serious about fixing this issue, lets explore every avenue is all's I'm sayin'. It doesn't help when the police refuse to assist with such investigations. 

&gt; As evidenced by this case the powers the police already have can be used to identify people who want to support ISIS. Where there is a specific risk, such as this case, it should be identified and dealt with through the justice system.

I agree that those who pose a risk ought to be monitored. But again, this is a question of proportionality. Did they try too hard? Did they ask too much from these women?

As well as this, my university has been excellent at accommodating for my condition. Thankfully I have not suffered too badly while at university, but I have a DSA learning plan in place and all my lecturers have been very understanding. 

It may be worth applying for some courses to see what kind of a response you get, it'll cost £23 to apply for more than one choice through UCAS. You'll have to write a personal statement, and you'll need a reference of some kind (can be academic, work-based).

The government has several options when it comes to raising money. The most obvious route is through taxation but they can also borrow money when they need to through various means. Issuing gilts and bonds is a very common way of doing this,  notably the UK has never ever defaulted on its debt.

&gt;Did I at any point say anything like that? You're being very deceitful here Khaiyan.

It's very much implied in your tone. It seems you want to deflect any criticism from Britain's radical Islam problem, and onto the British government.

&gt;In article number one, the author says there have been 500 fighters from the UK go to Syria. Yet in article two, the MP merely ""estimates"" that there have been 500 / year. Already a contradiction. Who are we to believe?

Why don't you use the Foreign Office's numbers? **""The UK Foreign Office said that they believe over 400 individuals have travelled to Syria since the uprising began, but said that they could not give exact numbers.""** Unless you think that number is totally fabricated as well?

&gt;So far there have been a handful of British people killed by ISIS. A very serious threat, no doubt, but no more so than many other international threats we face.

It only takes one of those ruthless psychopaths to return to the UK and wreak havoc. You are naive if you think ISIS does not increase the chances of another 7/7 or, at the very least, a Greenwich style lone wolf attack.

&gt;And the third article, the very first line clearly states:

&gt;The majority of British Muslims oppose violence against people who publish images depicting the Prophet Muhammad, a poll for the BBC suggests.

Did you read the rest of the article? ""But 27% of the 1,000 Muslims polled by ComRes said they had some sympathy for the motives behind the Paris attacks."" A quarter of those surveyed sympathize with Hebdo terrorists.

Edit: I just want to say this is what I was told at JSA. If this wrong please correct me. But if this is the information there giving out its worrying.

1. I would suggest checking out a website called anyvan.com 

The site is an ""eBay"" for courier jobs. The client posts a job e.g. ""move small sofa from London to Leeds"", the couriers then bid for the job. Of course there will be loads of people with massive sprinters going up and down the country all day but your dad might be able to offer a good price for local jobs. 

2. Probably more obvious, but advertise locally, in shops, post offices, etc ""man with a van"" , including getting on google maps, which is free and can attract a lot of business. Also get in touch with local businesses, e.g. A local florist. You might get the odd job or a small contract.

3. Food delivery. So delivering pizza doesn't sound very glamorous; but you've had no courier jobs today and you can get paid £1 per delivery, plus tips and probably with some free food thrown in at the end of the night. My friend does this on a slow night he does 30 deliveries and on extremely busy night has done 80 odd. 

4. Window cleaning / odd jobs. Depending if your old man is able bodied or doesn't have a fear for heights, window cleaning can net a few quid.

If tomorrow I woke up and all I had is a corsa van and some fuel, as a means of income I would consider doing a mixture all of the above, I don't think I would become a millionaire but I'm sure I could make a living.

&gt; It's very much implied in your tone. It seems you want to deflect any criticism from Britain's radical Islam problem, and onto the British government.

Again, show me where I have implied this? You can't just go saying things without backing it up with evidence. I could do you for libel mate. 

&gt; Why don't you use the Foreign Office's numbers? ""The UK Foreign Office said that they believe over 400 individuals have travelled to Syria since the uprising began, but said that they could not give exact numbers."" Unless you think that number is totally fabricated?

My point was merely the second article was misleading -- the numbers are much lower then the MP ""estimated"". In fact, we have more murderers in the UK in one year then we have had Jihadi extremists over the whole length of this conflict. Do you think your hysteria is warranted? 

&gt; It only takes one of those ruthless psychopaths to return to the UK and wreak havoc. You are naive if you think ISIS does not increase the chances of another 7/7 or, at the very least, a Greenwich style lone wolf attack.

This is just empty rhetoric man. One lone gunman isn't going to destory the UK. Below is a quote from Professor Jeffrey D. Sachs: 

&gt;Yet, in most cases, terrorism is not rooted in insanity. It is more often an act of war, albeit war by the weak rather than by organized states and their armies. Islamist terrorism is a reflection, indeed an extension, of today’s wars in the Middle East. And with the meddling of outside powers, those wars are becoming a single regional war – one that is continually morphing, expanding, and becoming increasingly violent.

Next point:

&gt; Did you read the rest of the article? ""But 27% of the 1,000 Muslims polled by ComRes said they had some sympathy for the motives behind the Paris attacks."" A quarter of those surveyed sympathize with Hebdo terrorists.

Sympathise in what context? Perhaps they felt sympathy in that these youngsters had been preyed upon by IS recruiters? Or maybe they felt sympathy with the feeling of alienation and demonizition by the right wing press?

We have a clear articulated approach-  players with premier league experience costing no more than £10 million.  Granted, we deviated from this last year with the Bale windfall, but I place my trust in the front office.

Clearly, the number one problem that needs to be addressed is the back line.  Our two announced signings this summer are both defenders.  I like both of these signings.  When the team's goal differential is in the single digits and we still place fifth......    

I have great confidence in our midfield.  They are young, skilled and, from what I have seen, are both hungry and want to play for the badge.  We have great talent moving up this year and coming through the academy.  

If we ARE going to splurge on anyone this year I would hope it is a striker.  I can see a sophomore season drop off for Hurri-Kane.  I hope that Chadli continues to bring it. Maybe Adebayor is ready to come back into the side and score meaningful goals.  I am afraid Roberto is going to be shown the exit.

I hear you and agree that we are immensely talented and I friggin LOVE Everton. I know that we have the potential to be great and I hope to see them be so.

What I was trying to get across is that amidst that hope, I see the club needing supporters in the stands, on Twitter, etc. And I wish people wouldn't pen articles like this one because all it seems to do is push forward the narrative that Everton is in a tailspin, which I just do not agree with.

See that bit in bold there. That's *your opinion*. Who says it's better? Or worse? Or less worthy? Or more? And no, I'm not covering up for what I said earlier, I genuinely was taking the piss out of you and don't really give a shiny shit whether you thought it was funny or not. You said yourself if anything ever happened to you:

&gt; Or just not donate at all and still get rescued by them. 

which is the worst kind of affected posh twat attitude you're precisely whining about. 


A lot of what is reported in the news regarding mountain rescues is reported on the basis that yes, someone has gone walking/trekking without proper equipment. But more often than not sheer unlucky accidents happen even to well prepared crews. How is it anyone's place to say that the rescue service that helps save someone with a twisted ankle, or a group stuck in sudden unexpected inclement weather, deserves less donations because those people somehow should have expected it? The service carried out by mountain rescue teams is one or two short steps away from other rescue services - as I said earlier, do you consider Air Ambulances or the RNLI less worthy too? 

Pretty much everyone else is pointing out the same thing to you. No one charity is more deserving than another. Donation is personal choice. What everyone's taken issue with is your ignorance of (which you yourself pointed out) - or perhaps its just sheer obstinance to accept - the myriad of different services that mountain rescue teams carry out, mainly as **volunteers**. You're tarring the whole thing with a one-size-fits-all ""it's a charity for posh twats"" banner, which it isn't. As I said, stop bleating ignorance and then complain when you're called up on it.

Depending on the modules you took as well it could be useful, pharma companies for example will often look at you having genetics for some areas mRNA work or whatever, immunology for others so the modules you did, while making up part of the 2.2 can provide more detail and may be worthwhile there too?

I would put down the tutoring too, teaching is great because it is a vital skill in industry, you will eventually work with more junior staff when you progress and shows communication / people can work with you and all. If it went well you could use that as a reference too to further give it weight. Certainly very much more positive than saying you did nothing last year or leaving it blank , teaching is a great bit of experience to have on the CV.

Interview technique is difficult, I doubt there is much I could say over reddit you 1) Don't already know 2) Could find out with google tbh.

I was 23 when I decided to go back into educations, fortunately for me I had GCSEs but was just into other things at the time, so I went and did an Access to Higher Education Diploma, smashed it and now I'm well on my way doing an Astrophysics degree at Nottingham. 

A good friend of mine that I met on my Access course also had no GCSE's before the Access course. All he had to do was a year of GCSEs in Math, English, Science and IT and he got onto the course. IT IS NOT TOO LATE FOR YOU MATE! He's also well on his way doing a Physics degree and through sheer hard work has turned into a really great Mathematician. 

So what I'd suggest is doing a bit of research, work out what your education path is gonna be, and do it. You will have to do a hell of a lot of hard work to get back on track, but once you get on that degree/college course and see that you can math with the rest of them it will be all worth it. If you want to learn maths I strongly strongly suggest going into Kahn Academy, it begins with the very basics such as arithmetic, and goes all the way up to the beginnings of Vector Calculus. If you ever have any questions on any math related things, honestly, just drop me a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I love helping people with maths.

Opponents of austerity tend to argue that it's better to hold back on cuts until the economy gets back on its feet and then pay it down when tax receipts are stronger and it's not going to damage the economy. 

Which side is true is hard to tell, but one thing I would point out is that there's a difference between the rhetoric and reality of austerity. The government has actually been quite flexible with the public finances even while talking tough. E.g., Osborne scaled back his original commitment to eliminate the deficit in a single parliament.

null,false,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,null,"A major reason employers want references and career history for entry level jobs is that they need to cover themselves legally since they bear liability for you in the work place. 

In retail you will be handling their cash, in customer service you will have access to customer's personal data, in admin you will likely have access to the company's sensitive data. They need to know they can trust you. 

You need to be able to explain that two year gap. Imagine you were thinking of employing someone but they wouldn't tell you what they had been doing for the last two years. Were they a drug dealer? Were they fired from their last job for something terrible? Have they been in prison? 

A large gap is a giant red flag to most employers, but you *can* overcome that so long as you can explain how you were supporting yourself financially, how you were spending your time and why you weren't in paid employment. 

 
It will be a LOT easier for you to get in to work if you can be honest. You don't have to go in to details but if you can something like 'I took a break to help care for a family member with a disability' it won't leave those question marks around you. 

You can use the tutoring work as a self-employed section on your CV. If any of the kids' parents are willing to give you references that would really help. 

You can also start volunteering and get references through that route. I would recommend asking your local charity shops if you can volunteer to start with, since that's a good road in to retail. 

You can also go to temp agencies. I had a long gap in my career history a few years back because of ill health and luckily for me a temp agency I registered with gave me some warehouse work, so that they could be one of my references and they very quickly got me back in to well paid admin work.

He was bound by the 'needs to be electable' criteria in the same way the Tories are: just as the Tories don't mention ideological things like shrinking the state or privatisation in their electoral campaign, Miliband never really mentioned what distinguished Labour (a commitment against austerity a la SNP or something like that) and seemingly refused to attack the Tories in the media, at least on the same scale as the trash that was coming out of number 10.

I think that my preferred outcome would have been a Labour-SNP-Plaid coalition (with Labour on around 270-280 seats) more than anything in truth. It would have addressed concerns we have over political representation of the devolved nations, paved the way for progressive attitudes towards voting reform and perhaps helped mitigate the cuts in the next few years while acknowledging the importance of fiscal security AND public services without blind ideological bluster (which I found was actually quite a refreshing aspect of Labour's campaign - it seemed at least pragmatic, not relying on buzzwords and scaremongering, if a little weak), which are all important concerns for me.

Looking at the leadership election my preferred candidate would be Burnham as I think he's more left-leaning than Cooper and Kendall while being much more electable than Corbyn. He's like a slightly more right-wing, more polished Miliband, and I think he's the most likely candidate to be able to advance a progressive agenda post-2020 (unless the Tories rip themselves to pieces over Europe before then).

Do you not find the first part alarming as it is? 27% of 1,000 Muslims polled are willing to accept the Hebdo terrorists' motives. It should be a 0% unequivocal no. OK, 0% is unrealistic, but you have to realise that 27% is too damn high. These are the ""harmless"" thoughts that eventually manifest into condoning, encouraging and possibly, participating, in violent attacks in the name of Islam.

&gt;If you're so frightened, I will personally take you to my local Mosque to put your fears to rest. I guarantee you that most Muslims stand firmly against the killing of innocent people.

It's not necessarily about killing innocent people. I have no doubt that most Muslims would be against that. The problem is that a lot of British Muslims support a literal adoption of the Islamic faith. Although the values taught do not explicitly call for jihad, they creates a thought structure that, with some nudging by extremists, enables Muslims to be easily radicalised. Its true with any religion; i.e. Buddhist extremists in Burma, Christians in parts of Africa, Hindus in India, etc. but unfortunately, there appears to be greater proclivity within the Muslim community, especially the British one, to this practice.

Until I see the day where Christians are killing in the name of Christianity (and no, white killers do not qualify for this), Sikhs killing in the name of Sikhism, Hindus killing in the name of Hinduism, etc. *on the level* that some Muslims have done in the UK - or tried to do so but were averted by British security services - I seriously do believe that the British Muslim community has some soul searching to do.",null,0,null,1434929381,null,0,1434929620,0,cse8nv8,null,t3_3alzlm,null,t1_cse8nv8,null,t1_cse7s21,null,null,null,1437243311,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

legally, your employer has to accept that.
in practice, they may not want you to leave so may say 'we won't accept it' - meaning 'please stay!' - or they may come back and make you an offer of more pay or something to stay.

I work in Adult Education, and my college essentially exists to help persons like yourself.

Your likely journey looks a little like this: 

* spend a year doing your English and Maths GCSE, plus some meetings doing what is now called IAG and used to be called careers advice.

* The year after, you'll probably do either and Access course or another level 3 qualification. 

* The year after that you'll start an undergraduate program.

From what I've read of your posts, you're probably looking to get in touch with Slough Eton college or the local offer provided through libraries and community centres as noted here. http://www.slough.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/adult-learning.aspx If you are a British citizen and do not hold a Grade C in English or Maths you'll be fully funded to get onto a course to improve your grades and thus your employability. Being on a benefit like ESA or DLA (if you are unemployed) will also entitle you to a discount or full fee remission for many accredited courses. Ask the administrators there about hardship funds and other possible help they can offer you. You'll be surprised.

As other posters have noted, you could be starting a well-supported university course in as little as two academic years. Slough is near the University of West London and they have a department for supporting students with disabilities http://www.uwl.ac.uk/students/support-services-for-students/disability-support where I am sure you will be able to get advice about completing your studies while working with your condition.

Other posters have noted about having a positive attitude, but let me be more direct. From personal (professional) experience I can say that just asking here puts you in the upper bracket of prospective students. You're obviously pretty literate, you're motivated at least enough to ask, and you have an aim for the future (or at least a will to change your present). *That really is enough to start you out.* Everything else is applying yourself and getting on board with the right help.

I'm not on here very often, and my organisation is sadly nowhere near you, but I'd be happy to offer any advice if you shoot me a message.

Best of luck, I'm rooting for you.",null,0,null,1434929959,null,0,false,0,cse8xo5,null,t3_3am2ys,null,t1_cse8xo5,null,t3_3am2ys,null,null,null,1437243389,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null
null,false,Iron__mind,null,null,null,"A delay of 30-59 minutes gets you half the value of your journey in rail travel vouchers, 60+ minutes gets the full value of the journey.

So a single ticket is divided by 2 for 30+ or face value for 60+. A return is 2 journeys so 30+ is divided by 4, 60+ is divided by 2. Weekly tickets are the equivalent of 10 journeys (so divide by 10 for the per journey price), monthly I think is 40 journeys, annual 400 but I'm not 100% on the last 2. You can obviously use those 3 types more than that set amount of journeys but that's how the cost is worked out.

Some things worth noting;

Check the companies website before you travel, if the service is cancelled in advance and posted on the website you can't claim a delay for it, the next train will be used to assess punctuality.

Keep your tickets, you'll need to send those in.

Fill the form in properly. I know I shouldn't have to point that out but I do.

Again, this might be the case as it stands, but go back twenty, thirty years, and Muslims weren't even on the radar. If Islam is prone to violence, then why has it only recently become an issue?

Poor analogy in my opinion. Although I personally do not support the death penalty, I don't know how you can compare it to the violent extremism espoused by terrorist groups. For a start, the death penalty would be for a convicted criminal and not some innocent person - which is unlike ""a [third](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7355515.stm) of young British Muslims who believe that the death penalty should apply for apostasy."" I think killing a criminal is more justifiable than an infidel. Second, the pro-death penalty believers are just that, they believe in that practice, but they never act on it - to be fair, they can't even if they wanted to. It's much different when you believe in an extremist interpretation of Islam. Its dangerous.

&gt;Bitching about Muslims to your mates and people on reddit is hardly opening those avenues of conversation.

Not bitching about Muslims. I don't take pleasure out of it. I have great admiration for Islamic culture, visited several Muslim countries and I appreciate the language, arts, and even some of the beliefs the religion advocates it. I just think the British Muslim community should take a leaf out their American counterpart's book, which has shown itself to be both Islamic, and unsusceptible to extremism. How many Muslim Americans have you heard off that are fighting for ISIS? Very few compared to the number of Brits.

&gt;What evidence do you have to back that up? 

Honestly, there's only some much evidence I can provide you. The polls provide a good indication of how widespread some of the problematic parts of Islam (like condoning motives for violence) are. Again, you can dismiss them as unrepresentative, but when many polls reach the same findings, you have to ask yourself whether there may be *some* merit to them.

&gt; If Islam is prone to violence, then why has it only recently become an issue? And why is it that it became a much bigger problem after our failed wars in the middle east?

Iraq was a mistake, no doubt. But its pretty unwise to blame all Islamic extremism on that war. How do you explain Muslims killing each other in Kenya, Somalia, Yemen, Indonesia, Pakistan, etc? All these hotspots have attracted fighters that are motivated by the same ideological reasons that drive Britons to join ISIS.",null,0,null,1434931193,null,0,false,0,cse9iax,null,t3_3alzlm,null,t1_cse9iax,null,t1_cse8yom,null,null,null,1437243740,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

It impedes traffic that is following the rules of the road coming up behind you, moving at an unknown speed and needing to make 4 lane changes to overtake you. If two cars arrive at the same time, with one overtaking another, somebody is going to have to break.

****Nobody should be undertaking in normal flow situations on the motorway.****

It's not allowed. But if you need more reason...:

People do not expect things to come up on their left hand shoulder. Yes they should check, but they're less likely to (because you shouldn't be there), and if they decide to move over we get a crash. (And the capacity of the road is severely reduced.)

Now the situation is different when the road system is heavily congested and all lanes are moving at very similar speeds. The inside lane may, in fact, be moving slightly faster. At these points you should all be staying in your lanes and not weaving. But this isn't normal flow. (Argh. I hate the bloody weavers. They're saving *seconds* overall on their journey, slowing everybody else's down, and increasing chances of a collision. Don't know why the ability to queue disappears in cars (and train stations). Small rant over, sorry)

The third lane is a capacity thing. If you don't move over when it starts to get busier you can become a genuine hindrance to the road flow. I can build up a model to show you how, if you like. (Could be an interesting little project to do)

Your last point is incorrect. You now have more space to your left than to your right - left hand lane AND hardshoulder vs right hand lane.

I'll admit I've not been a fan for as long as you by any stretch of the imagination (been following the club for about four years now only), but couldn't what's happened to Everton be seen in a lot of clubs who had former glory? We're hardly alone in being a club that performed absurdly well a ways back and now don't, in an era where football is dominated by money utterly and completely.

&gt; This is probably the most talented Everton squad since the 70's and the Holy Trinity. We should be making it into Europa every year at this point, if not the Champions league. 

I hear this piped around a lot, and it's true, and I think the 2013-2014 season proved it: highest points tally ever and a Europa League qualification. The problem is, we have our most talented squad in a long, long time with zero depth at a lot of key positions. We saw that when Stones was injured and Jags wasn't at his best at the beginning of the season and we had to deal with a past-it Distin and a never-really-had-it Alcaraz.

Is it different though? How many of these people actually act on these beliefs? Again, there are many in our society who hold morally questionable beleifs. But they are allowed to do so, and it is our job to convince them otherwise. Your defeatists approach does nothing to help the situation. You should be venerating those liberal voices, but instead you chastise the backward minority, tarring all Muslims with the same brush. It just stokes division. Be more positive is what I'm saying. 

&gt; Iraq was a mistake, no doubt. But its pretty unwise to blame all Islamic extremism on that war. How do you explain Muslims killing each other in Kenya, Somalia, Yemen, Indonesia, Pakistan, etc? All these hotspots have attracted fighters that are motivated by the same ideological reasons that drive Britons to join ISIS.

As part of a documentary series on this issue I've been interviewing experts in Extremism and terrorism. The root causes of extremism range from the politics of identity, religious ideology, foreign policy and economic deprivation. Each instance of radicalisation is individual with it's own unique set of circumstances. Ultimately our actions abroad have had a great deal to do with the rise of Political Islam. Pick up any history book and you'd begin to understand the long history of geopolitics, structural violence and corruption that have culminated in the situation we see today.

In short, it's a complex issue which requires our deep thought and careful reflection, but a problem that ought to be met with positivity and a willingness to engage. These divisions we create do nothing to help.

This makes it incredibly difficult for the government because it means they have to base policy on incorrect facts: see austerity, immigration caps, tax reductions, welfare cuts, these are allowed due to public perceptions that are categorically wrong. Of course this goes around in cycles, papers print story disparaging X, public are outraged want to hear more about X, more stories printed about X, politician responds to X, repeat ad infinum. 

You also have politicians making misleading statements too, for instance George Osborne recently stated in PMQ that the UK ""has 1% of the world's population but has 7% of total welfare spending"". What he didn't mention is our economy is 4% of the world economy &amp; our spending is in line with other European economies like Germany, France &amp; Italy with 12%, 10% &amp; 7% of world totals respectfully. [On a per capita basis it's also not very high compared to other European economies.](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SOCX_AGG) But that's not what his statement suggests does it? It suggests our spending is quite high, even though it's actually not, again relative to other similarly wealthy countries. This fits his motive &amp; justifies further welfare cuts, which as I said earlier he'll get away with as perceptions are so unbelievably wrong. 

Of course people don't think they're stupid. Just like they don't believe advertising works on them (hint: it does).

Sven Bender might be the most likely of them all that you've listed, even then I'm not sure he'd leave for us. We aren't that appealing still, and even with Dortmund's shocking season they still got to a cup final and pretty much did as well as we did in the league. 

Nainggolan has only been at Roma a year, and again he'd be leaving a champions league club. I just don't see it happening. 

More realistic and good signings for that role are here in my opinion; 

 - Alex Song 
 - Baumgartlinger
 - Iturraspe 
 - Krychowiak 

As For strikers Lacazette is not happening. At all. Way above our level, and his team is already in the champions league anyway, so if he was leaving it would be to a truly top team. (PSG, Chelsea, City, Madrid, Barca etc)

Martinez is Atletico bound, and I can't see FSG splashing the cash on him with our wage structure and his age. We wouldn't beat Atletico to him anyway. 

Higuain would be good, and Napoli missed out on the champions league places so he we would stand a chance of getting him. 

Rondon is a good target too. He's most likely going to be more than your estimate. They bought him for 15 mil 2 seasons ago and he's been great for them, there's really no reason they'd sell for less. 

The only other two you've listed are Nkoulou and Aubameyang. Both would obviously be great, but Dortmund will not want to let Aubameyang go. He's their star man with Reus and he was a saving grace for them last season, and again I'm not sure he'd come to us. 

Nkoulou might be doable.

Firmino would be amazing. No doubts, hopefully we land him.",null,0,null,1434934038,null,0,false,0,cseatcd,null,t3_3anbvp,null,t1_cseatcd,null,t1_cse9ryn,null,null,null,1437244677,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

null,false,Keavinho10,lfc12,,null,"All of what you said is quite true, but it's all a result of one thing, he's 20 god damn years old. Imagine his finishing was better, he'd rifle in 20 a year easily. It's encouraging at this point that he's finding himself in the position to get chances, and he can work on some of the more technical aspects. I think Liverpool is the best place for him to do that, but if City spend 50m on him then they'll probably give him a fair go as well. His passing is pretty good and no he wasn't horrible last year at all. Our expectations of him are far too high for a kid. We were playing him up front and expecting him to carry the goal scoring burden as a 19 year old. That's absolutely madness. What other teams in a similar position have done that successfully? 

Raheem is going to be a phenomenal player, and I have zero doubt about that. As you mentioned his pace and general physical ability is great. His strength is amazing for a kid his age and size. His first touch is brilliant and he's versatile. Not only that but he's tactically aware well beyond his years. The criticism of him for having a bad year last year aren't fair, because we put such pressure on a 19-20 year old kid. Consider that for a second.

I'm not saying 50m is the correct value by any means, but the suggestion that we definitely should sell him for even less if needs be is wrong because we shouldn't have much faith in our higher ups being able to bring in quality with the cash. We had a very mixed window last year, and didn't address all of our concerns so imagine how much harder that is going to be this year with less money, no CL and a precarious managerial situation. Oh ya, and no Gerrard. Players want to play with the best, and we'll have lost an iconic figure that has probably drawn players to us in the past.

As an example I needed a new modem last year, reserved it for collection at the branch where I live for the £32 web price, the shelf price when I arrived was £50.
I can understand the shop price being higher because of lower rats of sale, high overheads etc, but the duty manager (it was about 7.30pm so only him and one other member of staff in there) was insistent that the branch made all but nothing on the click and collect sales.

I don't think I have never seen a front with such a complete deficit of cafes, which is very frustrating when you're looking for lunch. I ended up eating in a chipper, which got very loud very fast as a completely smashed hen party turned up. It was a Thursday afternoon.

I'm sure a lot of people out there enjoy that sort of thing, I'm sure the people who were there were having a good time. I ended up going to the train station and sitting on the platform for an hour as I'd rather sit and browse the internet on my phone than do anything else.

If you were the wrong type of kid, you'd get the shit kicked out of you on a daily basis.

What's weird/interesting/cool is to see how things play out today. At the time my schools reaction was very limited, if you were caught fighting (and that included being on the ground crying having your head stamped on) you'd all get a detention, often with the person who was bullying you, and if your parents complained about bullying the teachers would do little about it in school and nothing outside of school. If you tried the police, they'd just say it was kids being kids, not a police matter. So it's interesting to see how cameras and peoples reactions to bullying have changed since then.
