Similarly, I don't see anything wrong with pensioners selling large homes and moving into smaller flats in later years to free up money to support themselves and housing to ease the housing shortfall in this country.

They deserve it. Reality has a liberal bias and does not care for conservatives who think they know better.

I fully realise that. But if you can't win some in the first place you've got no chance.

&gt;And I disagree that the others have no chance of winning over other voters. Apart from anything else, they've all shown sufficient flexibility during their political careers to contemplate things Corbyn wouldn't.

Exactly the sort of ""flexibility"" that's been turning voters off Labour (and the Lib Dems). Flip-flopping on policies and having no consistent, coherent message of opposition to the Tories is going to have exactly the same effect next time that it had in the last election.

&gt;I'm going on polling.

Which polling showed that the SNP support at the last election, or support for independence, wasn't linked to their left wing anti-austerity message?

&gt;It's in the Cruddas studies.

""The electorate voted for fiscal responsibility. "" - and that's where the problem lies. As I've said in other posts, whenever questioned about the economy under the last Labour government, the official line has largely been to apologise for it - continuing to support the lie that Labour has been less fiscally responsible than the Tories, and that the best way to tackle the deficit is through cuts rather than through investing.

The headline says that ""Labour lost because voters believed it was anti-austerity"", but the opinion polls he shows seem to suggest that Labour lost because voters had been sold on the idea of austerity across the board and that they thought the Tories would do that austerity better. 

If you don't actively sell an alternative message, you can't blame the electorate for buying the only one that's being presented. As the article says

&gt;The Tories message on the deficit was clear, Labourâs was not. The Tories are trusted to manage the countryâs finances, Labour is not.

Similarly, the statement ""The idea of an anti-austerity alliance with the SNP is unacceptable to a majority of English and Welsh voters. "" is then followed by a question about whether people would be concerned if the SNP were in government. No mention of austerity in that question. 

And it's not surprising that a lot of people were scared. The Tories, and the Tory press, painted them as scary almost foreign  bogeymen. And the Labour response? As with the economic message. it was to largely agree with them - desperately trying to distance themselves from the SNP.

What would have happened if instead, they'd tried the ""if that's what one region of Britain elects, then that's who we'd work with. They are good, honest people and nothing to be afraid of. We largely support their policies and if it keeps the austerity-mad Tories out of government then that's as good for England as it is for Scotland"" line instead of ""We've got profound differences. We wouldn't go near you, you scary Scottish people""? Maybe it wouldn't have had any effect. But we don't know, because it wasn't even tried.

On both of those things, and with many others, Labour tried to play on Tory terms - austerity good, the SNP bad, immigration ugly etc - and unsurprisingly came out looking worse than them on all those agendas.",null,0,null,1440108400,null,null,false,0,cu9zssw,null,t3_3hbmvb,null,null,null,t1_cu9t2qv,null,null,null,1441372932,null,1,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

so on the curious case of tiago ilori, the argument can easily be made he was never a 7m player. it can be also made that we paid 7m based on the potential of the type of player he can still become. 22 for a cb is still extremely young and he has been injured for a good chunk of the last two years. with that said, his presence in the u21 world cup was great and i thought his performances would certainly warrent spending 7m on a cb. i think we paid for potential on that deal and he still has a resell value that means we won't lose money. so not a bad signing there. last point on tiago, i think he will see time this season. in fact, i will make a wager with you now that he will play in 15-20 matches this season. 

next, borini was a flop in so many ways. thing that sux, is that we had actually been able to make a profit on him had he just agreed the move last summer. something out of our control slightly, and i am upset with that. with that said, not a bad player, good movement, good work rate, good attitude, just not the right fit for us. he needs games, and he's not going to get that with us. 

lovren we certainly overpaid. marko we did too. but marko again is the same deal as ilori, as i mentioned in my original post. we paid for potential. don't know if you ever watch nba or nfl here in the states, but it's the same idea when a team drafts an 18 year old kid who played 1 year in college and they take him early in the first rounds. if he pops, you win big, if he busts you still can trade/transfer them.

The recommended dose is 1 of these 1000mg capsules a day.


You'll have heard of Evening Primrose Oil.... Well, the Starflower seeds yield a higher potency of Gamma Linolenic Acid - GLA. As you'll find with a quick Google, GLA stimulates prostaglandins, has an anti-inflammatory action on painful joints - it does a wide variety of good work. But the Starflower - or Borage, its original, traditional name - far outperforms Evening Primrose. I think even 20 years ago it wasn't easy to buy - just Solgar did it. 

Borage grows everywhere, in profusion - in this country, all around the Mediterranean, through Eastern Europe &amp; into Russia. And until the modern era it provided one of the main cooking-oils of choice. People consumed a *lot* of it. We used to eat the leaves raw, &amp; cook with the oil. 


You'll find there's been considerable research into therapeutic use of borago officinalis. But it was, I think, about 25 years ago that the French beauty industry launched an ""anti-ageing"" supplement which took off like wildfire. This contained a small amount of borage oil - perhaps 10% of today's H &amp; B softgel - but borage was now rediscovered and marketed by the prettier name of Starflower.

Thats fine, its a big brute but y'know.. why not.. The next problem I have is that when i'm sitting on a bus, plane, train and there is a slight vibration, a standard disk will not read/write as well as an SSD.. not to mention the performance benefit.

Finally, I wanted something that would run multiple VM's and not break down and weep. So I wanted an i7 processor.

When I'm on my VM's im generally needing as much screen acreage as possible.. so a high res would be good.

When i went to the check out for the thinkpad it was going to cost Â£3000 and that was for lower performance numbers than the MacBook Pro.

A key point to consider when dealing with the SNP is that they are accountable for nothing.  *Everything* is someone else's fault, they are always looking for a scapegoat and somewhere to pin the blame.

If someone gets a one-up on the SNP, the SNP spin it so the one-up party looks bad.  An example was at the recent election where it was near certain Cameron was getting his majority, so Salmond comes out with his shit about how they have no legitimacy in Scotland.  Sour grapes with mould on.

The SNP are pure poison and running basically unopposed because Scottish Labour have imploded.  There is a desperate need for a new, but similar, party to give them a hard time.  The SNP wheels could well come off in the face of credible opposition because the independence debate exposed them for the duplicitous charlatans that they are.

By the way, most ""Yes"" voters only voted such because it was the only option contrary to the status quo.  Only hardline SNP Kool-Aid addicts genuinely believe that full ""independence"" (or Salmond's warped definition thereof) would be a good thing, whereas anyone with the IQ of a potato can prove otherwise.

Time is composed of divisible units that are universal. The smallest unit of time is known as the Planck second.

It is the amount of time it takes a photon to travel a Planck length (the smallest divisible unit of space), I would specify in a vacuum, but the unit of space is many orders of magnitude smaller than anything that could occupy it. This is the shortest event possible in the universe, because you can't travel faster than light, and you can't go smaller than a Planck length (many theories explain this many ways, but in short, it's just impossible). 

Everything has an age that is an accumulation of these Planck seconds. Now the TARDIS, being the best clock in the universe would be able to tell the Doctor what his accumulation of these Planck seconds were, and thus, his real age.

The Fourth Doctor said he was around 200 when he stole the TARDIS (not an event he'd likely forget). The TARDIS said in The Doctor's Wife she stole him around 700 years ago. Thus, the age of roughly 900 he was giving until he ran from Lake Silencio was presumably correct.

Targett needs to work on his defensive positioning, he let people past him in the first half far too easily and a couple of times after being caught out in their half he was very casual in strolling back while they were coming forwards.

Our midfield looked so much better with Romeu and Wanyama there, though JWP really needs to find a role out there because other than set pieces he's mostly anonymous out there when we need more of a midfield presence (and he has Davis to learn from in that regard).
Caulker had a shakey first 2 minutes and then settled in pretty well.

I don't know what exactly you mean by this. There's plenty of Muslims from Europe who've went off to fight for ISIS without being any more subject to these injustices than anyone else in the countries they've lived in. There is obviously a cultural side to it, religious or not.

&gt;This is why proactive war is so bad.. it's just asking for terrorism as a response.. the establishment cannot have been blind to that.. unless they are truly incompetent.

What does this even mean? Wars are obviously going to have repercussions, I doubt anyone in the Government didn't believe everything would go fine and dandy without a care in the world. And I hope you're not advocating that appeasement of terrorists is a valid reason against military action.

&gt;Also, it has an attractive cultural identity and there's nothing to fear from that

I wouldn't say that most modern Muslim countries have a cultural identity that I wouldn't fear if I lived under it.

&gt;No.. Cameron and the Conservative heart is as prejudiced as the religion's they suggest are troublesome.. casting 'us' and 'them'.. or more often 'U.S.+uk' and 'them', is just a way to feed their own misplaced sense of superiority.

For example? Who is the ""them"" meant to be? ISIS? Islamic terrorists? I would hardly group those examples in with ""us"".

&gt;well the Conservatives create bigger and more dangerous errors that ever Islam in the UK does.

Well, I'm not sure what you're implying here about the Tories but I have to say I disagree.

&gt;Also the Conservatives are the most out of touch because they tend to come from the least worldly wise of people.. those who are soft in the head and in their experience.. lacking understanding of the hard edges of life and comfortable, they are happy and willing to inflict their stupidity on others.. which is why they have capability to be so dangerous.

Now I'm just convinced you're trolling.

Things like inciting violence and hate speech have been against the law for a very long time, so it's not like they've never taken a position on the damaging behaviour that is often motivated by extremist viewpoints. What this comes down to is telling people what they should think and what beliefs they can express (not just how or where they express them), which is something I don't believe the government should do. There is a significant difference between saying:

*""this is what the science tells us is healthy to do with your body; here are our recommendations for what to eat""*

and *""these are the moral values we believe everyone in society should hold; here are our recommendations on what to think. Even if you're not breaking the law, we will not necessarily leave you alone if you don't adhere to these values""*

What I think people take issue with is that to rest assured that the goverment will ""leave you alone"", you no longer just have to avoid crossing a line in behaviour - breaking the law - but also in your thoughts and beliefs.

The things you mentioned are their privileges as a nationalist party, when something goes right it's because they represent the Scots better than any other party, when it goes wrong it's all London's fault and if they were sovereign it wouldn't have happened.

Add to that that they don't need to care about their image outside of Scotland, if anything a terrible image in the other home nations helps them, for the longer they stay out of a Westminster government the more they can claim that the rest of the union doesn't want Scotland to be represented.

The thing that gets me the most though, is that the yes campaign asked Scotland to make such a large decision on a million ""maybe""'s, there was no confirmation on what EU membership would look like, instead of deciding on a currency option the refusal of a currency union was laughed off. 

They made it look like the Scots don't respect the other Brits and then asked them to take a leap of faith, I believe a lot of people who voted No could have reconsidered if the post-union options were clear.

null,null,draw_it_now,,I kinda like Corbyn,null,"I'm going to say a (possibly) unpopular opinion here; Blairism (or whatever it's called) is dead. Labour will not win the 2020 election, but has a chance to win back seats. However, the continued clinging to Blairism as a framework for the party is killing Labour, and will completely destroy it if such an ideology remains a force in the party until 2020.  
  
What the Labour party doesn't seem to understand about the Blair years, is that the working classes, while still only a minority of overall voters, are still their core electorate.  

The 80's ""wandering years"" weren't necessarily a failure of Labour, but the very reason they were able to win in 1997 - they put their efforts into winning the working classes, making sure that they would vote for them regardless of the leader.  

When Blair took 97, all he had to do was win over the middle classes, with the knowledge that the working class seats were safe.  
  
What has happened since then, is the working classes have wised up to Blairisms policies. They've fled to the SNP and UKIP (regardless of whether those parties will actually help them or if their message just sounds nice).  
  
Now here's the thing, I don't disagree with Corbyn's critics. He is unelectable - *if* you think winning the prime-ministership is the only important thing.  

Like it or not, Corbyn is popular. He won't be prime minister any time soon, but if given the opportunity, he could win back those core working class votes, destroying UKIP and the SNP - and maybe, in 2025, his successor will be able to do what Blair did, and grow the electorate to a winning popularity.

The professional player eventually decided to move away to a different sport after some controversial incidents which caused him to get benched and now the coach is looking for ideas on who to hire as their replacement. The Purples want to hire another professional player but the Reds want to hire a local to return the team to their roots. The Reds have the largest supporter base but are being accused by the Purples of being infiltrated by supporters of other clubs to influence the coach in a way that they believe will cause the team to fall down the leaderboards. This is causing a split between the Reds and the Purples.

tbh this is what I'm annoyed about. Any sort of discussion always seems to devolve into 'British/white guilt' or something, which is absolutely rubbish, and not what I'm intending to do. It seems like a disingenuous way to stifle any nuanced discussion. 

My argument is that the major powers of today, such as Britain, or France, or America, have benefited from this colonialism, and most importantly we still continue to benefit from it today. On the other hand, many African countries have been very negatively effected by colonialism, and still feel the effects of that today. This also includes neocolonialism and continued exploitation in Africa. We would not be the country we are now if it was not for colonialism. 

As I said, we need a nuanced debate. We need to seriously discuss what the colonial powers brought to colonised countries, whether positive or negative, and what effects that has today.

http://www.poverty.org.uk/summary/eapn.shtml

Interestingly some other approaches, based on income and spending and so on actually put *more* people in poverty. 

http://www.cpag.org.uk/content/measuring-poverty-alternative

The idea that ""poverty"" is about being starving and having to make a shack out of old cardboard boxes to live in is incorrect. One of the better definitions I've read is:

""Individuals, families and groups in the population can be said to be in poverty when they lack resources to obtain the type of diet, participate in the activities and have the living conditions and amenities which are customary, or at least widely encouraged and approved, in the societies in which they belong""

Any definition is going to catch some people who aren't actually in poverty, but as long as it's not too many and that overcatch is consistent - it doesn't really matter. What matters is trends. In the  UK poverty rates started falling in 1997 and then began rising again in 2010. I'm not saying that's because Tory governments cause poverty, because it's more complicated than that. But George Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith are not particularly helping the poorest in our society.

The threat to a sizeable proportion of Ukraine's citizens is real, and Putin responded to protect them. 

Plus, if the aim had been to take the Ukraine, Putin could have seized Kyiv in 5min. So far he hasn't done this, because as far as I can tell, this isn't his aim. 

Also, it takes two to have an argument- the West has not been exactly the most welcoming to Russia in more recent times, and especially Obama and Merkel.

I thought Targett was massively better today, he got caught out less and to be frank getting some cover backs wrong is part of the game. Every single full back gets caught out otherwise what would be the point of having a winger to attack? Much better going forward with a very good almost Mane like attack forward and good shot on goal later in the game. Is he as a good as Bertrand? No. But you cant fault his work rate and I feel the bigger hole is midfield.

Wanyama has felt very lackluster these last few games almost to the point where I felt Mane was more involved than him but thats probably selective bias. Midfield was a lot better, better formation and the conceded goal was very unfortunate. However it is still our weakest area, I have faith in Clasie but it's really frustrating that he's been injured these first few games. It would have been invaluable experience for him.

All these people have been the target of government surveillance.  

*What on Earth makes you think it would only be used against terrorism?*  

What happens if something unjust happens against a loved one and you end up having to take on people in power?  What if they're reading your correspondence to your lawyers? Would you still be ""fine"" with surveillance?  As it looks increasingly likely that those in power colluded in allowing huge numbers of innocent children to be abused, can you seriously not see a problem with giving them the power to perform surveillance on victims and their lawyers?

In any system of government, regardless of how oppressive, there will always have been people who didn't concern themselves with politics and would only have been interested in their own narrow interests and ignored the suffering of others.  Freedom requires vigilance and speaking truth to power is sometimes a matter of civic duty.  Yes you personally may not have anything to hide, but maybe that's because you're not politically active right now, but that doesn't mean that we can allow government surveillance on those who are.

In the modern world, more oppressive regimes are blatantly the least stable and secure even though every step they took would have been in the name of increasing stability and security; those steps would have seemed entirely rational at the time.  We should take this into account when deciding what is and is not ""necessary"" for the security of the state. The pattern tends to go that you introduce a policy in the name of fighting an uncontroversially bad enemy.  You state that this is necessary for the security of the country.  It therefore follows that anyone who opposes it is a threat to the security of the country and so they must also be subject to the law.  It then expands to everyone who is opposed to this expansion... and so on.  Before long vast swathes of the country are in opposition to the government, the actions of the government become even more desperate as they attempt to protect ""security"" against a growing opposition and so the country descends into instability.

There's also the massively obvious problem that government surveillance is trivially easy to get round if you are in the last bit genuinely nefarious, so ordinary people end up being *the only people* they are observing, meaning they have to expand who they're looking at to justify the expense. Hence you get situations like this:

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/apr/11/localgovernment.ukcrime

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2248295/Second-council-admits-using-anti-terror-surveillance-over-school-places.html

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1024162/Phone-spies-Town-halls-using-anti-terror-powers-bug-residents-calls-emails.html

These types of laws are justified with reference to the most serious possible cases, but end up being used in the most trivial cases.

If you aren't willing to look beyond your own self-interest when your freedoms are taken away from you then:

a) You may end up losing the liberal democratic system which gives you the stable and secure government that benefits you.

That's the key - it's a functional difference. For a metric to be useful, it has to tell us something we can act upon.

Why are we interested in poverty? Because we want to improve people's quality of life, in terms of housing, education, literacy, access to medicine, transport, sanitation etc etc.

If I am a politician and you tell me that 1 in 5 people are below an arbitrary poverty line, there is nothing I can do with information. You are stating that quality of life is purely a function of the country's economy.

If, however, you use a poverty index that actually incorporates deeper information about those issues with which we are concerned, then I can make decisions about how I direct the economy towards improving quality of life. If the poverty metric tells me that there is a strong weighting due to lack of access to education, I can do something about investing in that.

An arbitrary poverty line only measures relative wealth, and tells me nothing about either root cause or the effects, and is hence of no use in investigating either.

It is, however, useful in charity marketing.",null,0,null,1440118082,null,null,false,0,cua595c,null,t3_3hox0v,null,null,null,t1_cua4oy3,null,null,null,1441375508,null,1,null,BritishSuccess,t5_2vlyo,1,null

His playing time was chaotic, mostly sub appearances (a role he has never excelled in) with a few starts dropped in here and there -- but like I said, he never once started two Premier League matches in a row.  No chance to round into form, which is particularly important for strikers, especially one who's struggled with confidence.  

Scored a goal?  Great, go back the bench.  Meanwhile, Adebayor is miles off the pace yet starting the first eight PL matches.  Finally, after eight matches, Poch had enough of Adebayor, and so he gave Soldado (who at this point hadn't played in 16 days) his first league start -- *away* against Manchester fucking City.  And if you recall, we actually played well for the first 60-70 minutes, until two horrible officiating calls killed the team's spirit.  And Soldado played quite well in that match.  And then he went right back to the bench the following week against Newcastle.  That was how Pochettino handled him the entire season.  

So no, last season, he did not have chance after chance.  Not in any meaningful way. 

And actually, his being dropped had nothing to do with the team not winning matches with him in the side. Fun fact:  Our record last season in all competitions with Soldado starting was **10W 4D 4L**, including **5W 1D 1L** in the Premier League (that one loss being the aformentioned Man City match).

Hell, he actually scored 2 goals in his first 168 minutes last season, including in both of his first two starts (in all comps, obviously, because didn't get a start in the Prem until Man City).  And yet Pochettino persisted with Adebayor.

And the UK political spectrum isn't the same as in the US.  The Republicans are sort of equivalent to the Tory party and the Democrats are sort of equivalent to the Labour party, but that's a massive over-simplification and should be taken with a grain of salt.

If you voted Tory in May:

They're doing it because he should get off his lazy arse and find a job.  All this time he's spent scrounging and posting on reddit could have been spent doing work, any work, even at minimum wage.  It would be better than going without any income at all.

He should pull himself up by his bootstraps and stop being a leech on the state, which owes him nothing. 

We don't believe him when he claims he was there when we called for him.  He was probably on drugs or just couldn't be bothered to turn up.  He didn't turn up, which means he has to suffer ""sanctions"" to stop everyone defrauding the system. 

If you voted Labour in May:

Wait a second, this guy paid taxes so that he could receive benefits when he needed them.  It's a terrible economy and the guy is clearly not stupid, based on how he recalls his latest adventures.  He was THERE when he was called, but they ""forgot"" to mention to him that they'd had a reorg - how convenient.  

This guy has sold his personal belongings to scam artists who prey on people who find themselves in bad situations - he's willing to sacrifice.  He's gone hungry in the last couple of weeks in a country which has the fifth largest economy in the world.  

This is 2015 and not a single one of the 60 million people in Britain should be forced to go dumpster diving.  It's abhorrent and criminal, but this is typical Tory - if you're poor, they hate you and they do their best to try and trick you into not getting the help you need or the benefits you deserve as a previous UK taxpayer.

You do realise that the American model means that *everyone* pays more than we currently do even for worse service?

Even if you don't use the NHS here you still benefit from it as it keeps the price of private healthcare low.

&gt;The Armed Forces needs to be massively expanded in all areas, (using some of the money saved by scrapping the NHS) to protect us from or play a role in the destruction of enemies of the UK such as ISIS

I've supported this club for six decades and this is the most disgusting treatment of a board I've ever seen. I am ashamed that these ""Evertonians"" are distorting facts and ignoring history and lying about a man who has been a loyal Evertonian, who they accuse of being a Kopite. It is rubbish.

I am not sure if this Yakubu22 lad is old enough to remember Peter Johnson's short tenure, but that is what a disastrous board looks like. He actually was a Kopite and he cared more for his ownership of Tranmere than he ever did for Everton. The stadium plans each had massive problems. Kenwright tried several ways to raise finances for investment in the new ground schemes but these proposals failed for reasons that were most certainly outside of his control. It was Paul Gregg who wanted to use a dodgy reverse mortgage to finance the King's Dock stadium. It was Gregg who opposed the investment from Samuelson's group. Somehow though Kenwright receives all of the blame. I never want to see a billionaire foreigner running this club as his personal corporation. It would kill the very soul of our club. Chelsea and City are wealthy and they've won trophies but both are corporations that squeeze their supporters financially more and more. The supporters of those clubs are now clients. The foreign investment in Arsenal and the Kopites has resulted in mostly failure to win the silverware those supporters expect. Then you can look at foreign investment in Villa and Sunderland, both of whom have been very poor over the time they were bought by foreigners. Then you have numerous smaller clubs like Pompey, Blackburn, Hull, Cardiff, and QPR who have had various financial problems among other problems due to their foreign owners. 

My argument is not that Kenwright is perfect. It is that he does indeed care about not turning this club into another Leeds. It can happen to us if we are not careful. The reason we have no trophies in the last twenty years is that the players and managers we've had over that time haven't been good enough. Moyes did a good job for us but the players simply haven't been of the quality they use to be. If you want a period of our history where we really didn't achieve. Look at ever season after the championship in 1969 until the championship in the 1984 season. We wasted some excellent talent throughout those years. Those were better quality players than we've had in this period since 1995, yet they failed. That was a real era of failure, but this level of personal attack on the board. This is an embarrassment to this club. Being critical of the board is not the same as personally attacking a chairman who saved this club from the hands of a Kopite who cared more for Tranmere.

No. The war was the UN invoking the concept of collective security to put an end to the invasion of one state by another.

Also, I fail to see the relevance of who the Palestinians or the Americans were backing as to whether something is intrinsically good or bad.

&gt;Another war for oil; Attacking the peaceful Argentinan ship, Belgrano; D'oh colonialism

Unless you can provide proof that the UK knew there was oil there, and that that somehow took precedence over the UK's right to self-defence to respond to Argentina's illegal invasion of the Falklands I'll pass on the notion that 'it was for oil'. Also, the Falklands are hardly a case of colonialism when the people of the Falklands have always wanted to remain British citizens.

How dare the UK involve itself in the collapse of a state into a series of genocidal and ethnic-based warfare. Again, you try to indicate that the US being involved is somehow indicative of an inherent ""bad side"", which is absurd.

null,null,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,null,"You're not wrong, but honestly the lack of traditional wingers and a midfield enforcer isn't exactly working for our 4-2-3-1 either.  Yes, we have more bodies in the middle of the park, but if anything, the two inverted wingers in the band of 3 just come inside and get in each other's way, and no one in the band of 2 bothers to truly take responsibility for tracking runners and breaking up play properly.  So the extra bodies are arguably hampering us more than helping at the moment.

In a 4-4-2, it is possible to play a lopsided formation where not both of the wide midfielders are outright wingers.  One can be inverted and be compensated for by an attacking fullback - Walker and Rose are both perfectly equipped to do that.

City are a good example (and the finest exponents of 4-4-2 in the country right now), when they played Silva or Milner wide.  Neither are true wingers, and both are expected to be overlapped by Kolarov and Zabaleta anyway.

They're much stronger in the CM position than we are of course, but I don't see why we can't play with a midfield four of Dembele - Eriksen - Bentaleb - Chadli/N'jie, with Dembele tucking inside to muck in when required in the middle of the park.  I mean, he's pretty much been deployed to do that lately anyway, just slightly higher up the park where he's arguably less effective because he's not much of an attacking threat.  It's a somewhat lightweight formation, but I can't imagine us playing 4-4-2 against the top 6 or 8 in the competition anyway unless we're a goal down with 10 mins to go.

EDIT:  It would also be possible to add some steel by playing a midfield duo of Dier-Bentaleb, with Eriksen occupying one of the drifting wide midfield spots like Silva often does at City.

Whilst a lopsided 4-4-2 works, we had Eriksen on the LW under Sherwood, we don't have a right winger to allow us to repeat that. If we try and invert the right we will struggle to get Eriksen on the pitch, let alone in an offensive position. I can't feasibly think of 2 wide men, even with one inverted, that we can use.

Furthermore they relied heavily on outscoring their opponents with known quality world class forwards, we are talking about using 1 or even 2 players that have never even played for Spurs. For me the comparison falls apart.

I see your potential line up and comments about a weaker CM setup and for me a subjective line of being weaker than what we currently have is crossed. We can't replicate the fire power up front, we can't replicate the RW, we lose out heavily in the middle and ultimately all we achieve is moving our best creator in Eriksen deeper whilst also putting a heap of pressure on new signings.

Currently our best forward players are Chadli, Eriksen and Kane. Any formation we pick has to have them on the pitch leading the attack.

Maybe if we didn't have Kane and we were buying our #1 striker, but we're not. I know we need someone else who can play up front, but surely there are other solid options for less.

I don't think a 4-4-2 makes us better, but I also don't think it would specifically make us a whole lot worse than what we're playing right now, which frankly for the most part has rarely looked great on the pitch under either AVB or Poch.

Shoehorning Berahino into the starting lineup in whatever capacity is still not addressing the fact that we don't have a proper winger or a CDM.

And I do think Eriksen could even potentially be played wide on the right as long as we had more of a left winger in the side (I would offer Townsend, but he's too patchy and Poch doesn't seem to like him out there anyway).  Silva often starts nominally on the right for City, but rarely just sits there.

I know as you've mentioned City aren't a perfect analogue, but in all practicality I think Eriksen struggles to find space in the middle a bit because there's not enough movement around him to create pockets.  Having him wide often looked good under Sherwood because he's difficult for fullbacks to track and CDMs don't always know when and when not to switch onto him.",null,0,null,1440132536,null,null,false,0,cuacggo,null,t3_3hss1d,null,null,null,t1_cuaamya,null,null,null,1441378967,null,1,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

null,null,sriranjant,null,null,null,"Breaking down the results after Swansea game, as far as I can remember:    
17 Jan: 0-5 @ Swansea   
 
20 Jan: 1-1 @ Liverpool (League Cup Semi 1st Leg): We played a pretty good first half with Hazard penalty. Got roasted in the second, Cahill backed off for Sterling's goal and T-Bo made some incredible saves to keep the 1-1 result.    

24 Jan: 2-4 v Bradford (FA Cup): Less said the better    

27 Jan: 1-0 v Liverpool (League Cup 2nd Leg): Defensively sound performance, unlucky after a few decisions went against us (Costa pen). Wont say we played badly, had a few chances, but so did Liverpool. Brana winner    

31 Jan: 1-1 v Man City: Another good first half, with a nice move for Remy goal, but conceded thanks to Azpi+T-Bo error and moved into a defensive mindset in the 2nd half, but didn't give City any chances.    
    
7 Feb: 1-2 @ Villa: Scored early through Eden, but conceded what was Villa's first goal in ~6 games(?) and needed Branna to get another winner. Weren't bad, but certainly should've comfortably beaten that Villa team.    
    
11 Feb: 1-0 v Everton: Last gasp Willian winner after Cech wonder save. Poor performance    
    
17 Feb: 1-1 @ PSG: A decent away CL performance against a good side. Eden again by far the best player.    
    
21 Feb: 1-1 v Burnley: Infamous game, should've won comfortable if not for referee errors. Still feel that we should've won with 10 men.    
    
1 Mar: 2-0 v Spurs (League Cup Final): Shaky start, but controlled the game expertly after that. JT opener and Costa for the 2-0. A solid performance.    
    
4 Mar: 0-1 @ West Ham: A good away performance, created chances, Ramires had a great game, setting up Eden, hitting the post and forcing good saves from Adrian. Hammers had chances, but this should've been a bigger win.    

11 Mar: 2-2 v PSG: Very insipid, lacklustre performance, failing to take advantage of 10 man PSG. Subsequently, despite leading twice, poor errors from set pieces cost us.    
    
15 Mar: 1-1 v S'oton: A good start undone by conceded penalty in first half, threw everything at S'oton in the second half, created chances and forced goal line clearances/saves but no winner.    
    
22 Mar: 2-3 @ Hull: Excellent start should've allowed for cruise control at 2-0 but uncharacteristic defensive errors meant Remy needed to save our ass. Still, looked good in attack.    
    
04 Apr: 2-1 v Stoke: Charlie Adam wonder goal only blot in a decent performance, created chances.    
    
12 Apr: 0-1 @ QPR: Poor performance, needed Rob Green mistake to win it.    
    
18 Apr: 1-0 v Man Utd: Defensive game plan worked like a charm, and Eden should've had a brace for a good looking 2-0 win. United with very few chances.    
    
26 Apr: 0-0 @ Arsenal: Another defensive masterclass could've been capped off had we taken first half chances through Ramires or Oscar pen call.    
    
29 Apr: 1-3 @ Leicester: Dire first half, but excellent second half. Played with pace on the wings and created good chances to change 1-0 to 1-3.    
    
03 May: 1-0 v Palace: Below par game to get the job done and be crowned Champions.    
    
10 May: 1-1 v Liverpool: Started brightly, but faded away in the 2nd half.    
    
18 May: 3-0 @ WBA: Fabregas red card was hilarious.    
    
24 May: 3-1 v Sunderland: Goals for Remy and Costa, comfortable performance but needed to comeback from 1-1.    
     
08 Aug: 2-2 v Swansea: Great first half of football from both sides, we looked good in attack. Sending off definitely changed the game, and we finished stronger despite that.    
    
16 Aug: 3-0 @ Man City: Dire first half. Bit more life and energy in second half, but very few chances created, bad errors at the end.
   
So I think that we had games (West Ham, Hull, Sunderland) and spells in many games (Leicester, S'oton, Burnley, Swansea) where we attacked really well. Defensively, we were ace in almost all games, apart from a few individual errors (Hull) , a few bad halves (Leicester) and a few bad throughout (Bradford, WBA).    
A big factor through this spell was injuries of Diego Costa, Loic Remy, Cesc Fabregas and Oscar, so definitely some perspective needed.    
    
Looking ahead, I'm hopeful Pedro can give us goals we need and allow Eden some more space and time, and Costa should hopefully start to fire again.

We have Kompany who has regained form, Mangala who has played will so far and Denayer who, like De Bruyne is talented young and full of potential. Plus Denayer counts as a home grown player which is something we need right now. Otamendi is a great player and I'm happy we signed him, but there's other positions that need to be filled.

Same with KDB. Do we need him desperately? No, but are you sure he'll join us next summer, with possible competition from other clubs for his signature? Are you sure there'll be another top player avaliable next summer? I am not.

Exactly why we didn't sign another CM instead of Pogba. We'd rather get world class players that are avaliable now, an sort out several positions for years to come, rather than to panic buy someone instead who's not a world class player.

null,null,faithplusone01,lfc99,null,null,"I feel that this phenomenon can be summed up in two points:

1. None of our star players ever really performed to their best at a World Cup, and none of them ever won it. Dalglish, Rush, Gerrard, Keegan, Owen etc. didn't win a World Cup with their national teams, nor did they ever come close. The World Cup means a lot for the legacy of a player. 

2. Marketing. Marketing. Marketing. Zidane, Ronaldo, Maradona, Pele, Cruyff, Muller, Beckenbauer, etc. all had marketing machines behind them that turned their stellar World Cup performances into legend. Even United's equivalents  in Charlton, Best, and Law were subject to a lot of hype that the Liverpool players just didn't get. Charlton of course because he won the World Cup in 1966. Best and Law were extremely talented players in their own right, but I'd take Gerrard/Keegan/Kenny/Rush over them any day. 

Truthfully, Liverpool as a club has never been marketed globally like United has. I think that may have something to do with it also. Much as I'd like to see the opposite, I feel that the world vastly underrates our legendary players either because they won too little (Gerrard, Carragher) or too much (Dalglish, Rush, Molby, Barnes, etc.). 

Furthermore,  I'm not an Englishman, and I've got no ties to the city of Liverpool so I have no idea how much of this is true, but I feel like a regional bias against us within the English press may have something to do with it also. Especially during the Thatcher years, in which we were the dominant club not only in England but in Europe as well.

This is a complete overkill by the club. This is all ""justified"" through health and safety. I would be very interested to know whether the club will now ban a sheet of blue/red paper on each seat on the grounds that it can be scrunched up and thrown at other people. If some one is stood up holding a hot drink and gets hit on the head and knocks them off guard and spill the drink forward on the childs head in the row in front. And how are you going to make paper / card flame retardant? This is the absurd levels health and safety can be applied. So lets ban anything as it could be thrown and hurt someone. 

This is extremely draconian and is unreasonable. By placing so much protocol and red tape in place it will make banners and displays incredibly hard to get the approval. Essentially this is a method to use Health and Safety to punish the HF, even though they have already been punished by a cameraman. 


It is such a shame that this will have knock on effects. Obviously this will cause a rift between the HF05 and the board which could lead to more protests and shut-ups. Say what you want about them, Selhurst Park IS SHIT without the Fanatics support. We're like any other club without them.

And how pathetic the club need to know what is written on a flag, display etc. That is clearly censorship and the board need to be told to fuck off for that. They have never needed to know before.

The thing is I'd say it might be under the current system.

It's a minefield ethically though to say that people only deserve to breed if they are rich enough. 

If there hadn't previously been tax credits for every child, bringing in special tax credits for rape victims forced to raise their attacker's children might be seen as a good thing but in the current context all it is doing is forcing women to come out and admit that they were raped and then subject themselves to scrutiny in order to be more able to support their children.

I think some people forget all of the teams he's managed and some of the things he's achieved because he's so easy to poke fun at.

The year before he came to us, he was almost unanimously voted LMA Manager of the year for managing to take Fulham to the Europa League final; falling only at the end to Atletico Madrid. That's more than Rodgers has ever achieved in his life. The year after we sacked him, he performed very respectably with West Brom, giving them their highest finish in three decades on the back of wins over Chelsea and us at Anfield.

The fact that he also has a 23W 14D 5L record with England over the last three years also sort of shows why he's still in the job.

This is what the president of Inter Milan has to say about him:

&gt;""Roy Hodgson was an important person in the development of Inter Milan to the point we have reached today. He saved us at the right time. When he came we were in trouble and things appeared dark. He didnât panic, he was calm and made us calm. Disaster was averted at the most important time. Everyone at Inter will remember him for that and his contribution. He is considered by us all as an important person in our history. He left an endowment to this club thatâs important in our history.""

Yeah, Liverpool under Hodgson was indeed awful, but you can't just write the man off for that.

That's because aloe vera stinks.

Obviously a relationship with a local butcher means they will offer you bargains and cheap cuts, which can only be had in the reduced bit of the supermarket shelf (and then you have to eat them at once).

I would have to say that in general butchers do offer better quality than the supermarket simply because they are smaller and can monitor stuff better, and less is pre-packaged.

My experience of local butchers is that it is still the luck of the draw from joint to joint or cut to cut- unless you go for a quality shop or farm shop where the prices are also higher.

As others are saying, I think cut matters more than source for price. /u/hoffi_coffi 's post strikes a chord with me- brisket can be slow cooked to be as tender as topside, skirt is a real cheap luxury etc.

Interestingly, a recent survey showed Harrods's meat counter was often cheaper than supermarket pre-packed. We found this too- if you went into Harrods just before it shut and a lot of meat was reduced, it was really cheap.

But ultimately, it really varies- supermarket butchery counters often have a lot of offers, making them better value than the pre-packed.

I think that's the point that's being made. Sure, sometimes not giving the parents benefits will just result in them giving up more of their own personal spending for their children, but what about when personal spending is already stretched to the limit?

This exception presents a very complicated situation as having two distinct sides: either you were raped and therefore aren't ""to blame"" for the extra child, or you are ""to blame"" as you had it by choice. But women who were raped can have abortions. Many choose not to, and I totally understand why that is. The point of this is not to say ""these women should just abort their rape babies!"". What it boils down to is that rape victims have the choice to abort just the same as someone who gets pregnant through failed protection method (e.g. punctured condom). So why is it okay to punish that woman (and her partner, if she has a stable one) for something that is just as much a random act of fate as a rape, and has exactly the same options? The actual conception is naturally a thousand times more traumatic for a rape victim, but the actual consequence of supporting a child is no different, and that's what these cuts are affecting. 

Then the broader over-arching point is: why is it okay to punish the children *at all* for anything their parents may or may not have done irresponsibly?

I think the real problem with marriage in this age of 'western government' is that many people view marriage as something granted by government itself.

Marriage should be *recognised*, or *not recognised*, by governments (for the purpose of taxes and immigration) - but never made 'legal' or 'illegal'. Anyone should be free to practice a ceremony with each other freely no matter what it's called or who it involves.

Ultimately - what is a promise of vows between two people but sacred only as long as those two people keep them? You don't need a piece of paper, jewellery, ceremony, or even a government body to approve your promise - you make the promise and you keep it.

&gt;The academic evidence suggests that ideological positioning is decreasingly important to the vote.


&gt; Even anti-austerity voters donât trust Labour with spending. Overall,
more than 60 per cent of voters have serious concerns about trusting Labour with taxpayersâ money.3 This number is just as high in Scotland as it is in England.


&gt; no-one wants their library to close. But the Tories used their willingness to close services voters do not value particularly highly to show seriousness of intent on deficit reduction.


&gt; Labourâs purpose has to feel relevant and vibrant, fitted to a post-crash economy where wages for working families still have not recovered, there is high concern about prospects for the next generation, rising nationalism and deepening distrust of politics. Hand-waving about non-specific âvaluesâ will not cut it.


&gt;The issue that hurt Labour the most at the last election was the economy. The party was not trusted to manage the public finances, there was not a sense of how it would strengthen the economy and it even lost trust on living standards. Our post-election poll showed the Tories 7 points ahead on tackling the cost of living.


&gt;But make the choice about Labour tax rises or Labour borrowing and it is Labour borrowing that causes the greater concern.

Short answer? No, you won't be able to get a work visa. Not unless you are pretty much unique in your skills. In order for a us citizen to get a UK work visa, you have to be more skilled at what you do than anyone in the UK or the whole of the EU.

Don't even think about coming over on a tourist visa and disappearing, you won't be able to get a job without a work visa, and it would negatively affect your ability to get any visa at all in the future.

If you meet someone you'll be able to get in on a fiancÃ©e or spouse visa, but the requirements on that are pretty strict these days. If you have a parent or grandparent who was born here, that would help for an ancestry visa.

Firstly, Climbing Arc de Triomphe can give you a great view of the whole city and gives you a really nice photo opportunity with the Eiffel Tower in the background. If you don't mind climbing a ton of stairs then this is something worth doing.

Secondly, the Louvre is a must. I thought that I wouldn't be able to get anywhere near to the Mona Lisa but within 30 seconds I was able to find the gaps and get to the very front. This is a must-see IMO, and if you're a student you get in for free.

Thirdly, in the evening the Eiffel tower lights up like crazy for 5 minutes every hour. For me, seeing that from the outside is more of an experience than climbing the thing, so I'd recommend finding time for that as well.

By the way, the metro in Paris is really easy to use, much better than the one in England. Never get a taxi when you can get somewhere via the tubes.

null,null,s0kker,lfcflame,,null,"You clearly have no idea who the fuck Mkhitryan is. Mkhitty has been in form for the past six months and if he maintains that level, he is easily on Silvas level. His attacking and counter attacking are genius and the overall impact he brings to the game is insane. Now lets stop giving a fuck about Marko/Origi because clearly Brendan does not and you can't really compare Ibe to him because he is still too raw and unrefined to even touch him. So Coutinho and Firmino are the only ones who matter here. For Coutinho, He will press more and provides more to the overall game than Coutinho. He is also much better in *our* system than Coutinho, as he presses more with more energy, is faster and has more stamina to be a threat on multiple counters. Also much better shooting and I know you lot will cling to the fact that he wasn't great at it last year but I won't be swayed to think otherwise just because of one flukey and ridiculously unlucky season like last years. Also just as an effective a passer. Coutinho will also never reach 10 goals in a season. You lot lot here at this sub overrate him and I don't blame you, we seriously need a new 'face' of the team. Now between Mkhitty or Firmino, let's at least see  the neck-crowned-tattooed Brazilian reach *Coutinho's* level in the PL before we start comparing him to Mkhitty. But on a talent level he is really the only midfielder at the club right now who is anywhere as talented as Mkhitryan. ***fucking imagine*** Mkhitryan in that 13/14 season along Suarez/Sturridge and the best Henderson we have yet to see. Our attack would legitimately be Barca/Madrid levels of ridiculous that year.People often say that they'd love to see Suarez play in a midfield role as he would be amazing in it, Mkhitryan is the closest thing you're getting to see that.

The counter-argument to all this is that Britain is becoming more ethnically diverse, more metropolitan and less authoritarian in values. Labour would be swimming upstream if it were to try to become less liberal as the country heads the other way.
This argument is rooted in a good analysis of demographics but a flawed psychology and politics. The flawed psychology assumes that a Labour party that put a strong civic sense of Englishness at the heart of its identity in England, would somehow alienate the metropolitan vote. It would if it adopted UKIPâs definition of what it means to be English. But if it invests
itself in a pluralist, open, liberal idea of Englishness it can have the best of both worlds. This conception of national identity is the one we saw in the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games, and is similar to the way the SNP have an idea of Scottishness that is intrinsically about fairness and is open to different races and creeds (if not constitutional politics).

Many of you have made some really great points in this discussion and I was wondering if you would like to share your thoughts with the Culture, Media and Sport [Select Committee Committee](http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/culture-media-and-sport-committee/) in their inquiry into [establishing world-class connectivity throughout the UK](http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/culture-media-and-sport-committee/news-parliament-2015/terms-of-reference-connectivity-15-16/)? 

This is a chance for you to help the committee scrutinise the work of the Government and hold them to account. 

Some of the questions that they would like to hear your opinion on are:

* What role should Government, Ofcom and industry play in extending superfast broadband to hard-to-reach premises?

* Is there sufficient competition in these markets?  If not, how can any market failures best be addressed given the investments already made?

* Given that in practice a Universal Service Obligation could not capture 100% of households, what should a USO for broadband look like?

* What are other countries doing to reach 'not-spots'? How affordable are their solutions?

Find out more about the inquiry [here](http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/culture-media-and-sport-committee/news-parliament-2015/terms-of-reference-connectivity-15-16/).",null,0,null,1440146793,null,null,false,0,cuagsfq,null,t3_3hpfm7,null,null,null,t3_3hpfm7,null,null,null,1441381009,null,4,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

&gt; think i'm getting the gist of what your saying here. Its promoting staying in work to earn money to pay tax on, rather than succumbing to the 'job' of being professionally unemployed.

This was not what I was getting at but more people able to go to work would be an added benefit.

It's more that for every pensioner you need so many working people to pay for them because they are economically inactive. This problem will only get worse as life expectancy rises. Children are only a drain temporarily they are the workers and taxpayers of the future. If we don't have enough people to go out work and pay taxes the country as a whole will suffer.",null,0,null,1440148067,null,null,false,0,cuah3n9,null,t3_3htegl,null,null,null,t1_cuagncg,null,null,null,1441381156,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,null,A_Rolling_Baneling,num26,,null,"The way Poch sets the team up, the 442 and the 4231 do not look much different at all. His 4231 requires box to box CMs, much more like a 442 midfield pairing than most other 4231 pairings. 

In addition, he requires pressure to be applied by all outfielders when not in possession. So whether we play an attacking midfielder or a striker to complement Kane, their jobs will be similar. Pressing opposing CDs and DMs when not in possession will be required no matter who plays next to Kane. The selection of Eriksen, Chadli, Dembele, or another striker for that role doesn't indicate a large shift in philosophy but rather a desire for one of their specific talents.

Finally, a few times last year he played Kane at AM behind another striker. This was in effect a 442 with a supporting striker, not uncommon and again essentially the same as the 4231 in philosophy, only with attackers with different skillsets. I enjoy that within his very rigidly defined system of football, Poch is exploring versatility. There is a great potential for our attack to take many different looks. Especially if we bring in not only another striker but another attacking option, with N'jie and Townsend on the bench we can hopefully have better plan Bs going in to next season.

Most importantly, we can also (fingers crossed) rely on Kane and Eriksen less in attack next year. A line up without either of them is likely unwise, save for early cup games, but we can't keep them both in every week as Poch has probably learned.

Somewhat related, under Harry we played a 4231 most of the time with vdV supporting our striker, and when vdV couldn't play, we played two of Defoe, Crouch, Keane, Super Pav, etc. This indicated to me that vdV was seen as more of a striker than as a midfielder. It seems that in the last year Spurs are going back to this formula, which produced some fantastic football. Poch has his own flavor and what I find to be a much better system than Redknapp's (if there was one), so even if he has less overall talent at his disposal IMO, him as manager gives me plenty of optimism for the season.",null,0,null,1440148104,null,null,false,0,cuah3zs,null,t3_3htrbr,null,null,null,t3_3htrbr,null,null,null,1441381160,null,23,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,23,null

London lacks any character, it's full of bland bankers or artsy up starts. Also quick story time; I'm a Geordie, I'm used to seeing depraved areas and frankly mental human beings. London takes the cake, here are some happenings when I go to London 

1. A woman offering me a blowjob in a bus shelter 

2. My sisters boyfriend regaling me with a tale of how he saw human shit in the street 

3. Three lads cat calling my sister outside a nan dis

4. Homeless people everywhere. I'm not digging homeless people here, it's a societal problem that is accentuated in London. A large population of homeless people introduces rubbish etc

5. Busy. People are everywhere. All the time. Rush hour? Nope. McDonald's? Nope. 

6. Here's the biggie. The so called ""attractions"" are shite. London eye, expensive, and just meh in general. Houses of Parliament? Oh hey it's an old building. Buckingham palace? Awful. I'm glad that Americans spend money here to basically see a tax haven.

7. People from up north are less arrogant. I know your counter to this ""people always bang on about the north and overrate it etc"" Londoners have no manners, and believe that you will have your best time of your life in a hipster bar spending 20 quid for a couple of drinks, and talking about the newest Pop up restaurant.

The idea of Formal Hall, May Balls, and the like is totally foreign to me, so if I do end up going to Cambridge (fingers crossed) I'd like to have those experiences because they're not like anything I've done before. 

I'd be looking at the older colleges, as they tend to make more of these sorts of traditions.  Formal Halls in old dining halls, [arcane Latin graces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ's_College,_Cambridge#Grace), old architecture...

Not all colleges have a May Ball every year, so you could narrow it down on whether your preferred college will have a May Ball while you are there... 

Seriously, college doesn't make any real academic difference, and everyone seems to be fine with the college that they end up in, so these sorts of seemingly trivial things are good ways to narrow the field.

&gt; There's also a part of me that wants a relatively egalitarian college. Experiencing tradition is nice, but I don't know if I'd jive very well in an overly conservative environment. 

Some colleges are traditionally fairly conservative (Peterhouse, Magdalene, and Trinity and St Johns to some extent).  Kings is traditionally extremely liberal (to the point where they don't actually have a May Ball, but rather a June Event in fancy dress, and used to have a communist flag in the bar).

Especially  30, 40 years ago when you only got to watch them in world cups and European Cup finals. British teams haven't exactly done well on the international stage.

First thing you think about Maradona is the hand of God. Not what he did at Barca and Napoli.
First thing you think about Cruijff is the Cruijff turn not what he did at club level.
The only thing anyone even knows about Pele is the amount of world cups he won and at such an early age.

Even English players such as Moore, Hurst, Banks are all known for what they did in the world cup

And a lot of the players you mentioned such as Mezza and Baresi and Rummimiege are not that well known at least not to the average fan. Maybe Mezza because he has a stadium named after him but many people don't even know that. Some of Liverpools players such as Dalglish, Keegan, Hansen, and Rush were considered the best in the world. Rush got a transfer abroad, as did Keegan and he won the Ballon D'or not that it means much. But nowadays unless you care about history of football which concerningly not that many do because football was invented in 92, you're not really going to know these players by anything but name the same way not many people know anything about Mezza or the original Suarez other than their name and even then half the people have no idea why Luis Suarez is talking about Inter rather than talking about Messi and Neymar.

What ideas we have been wrong about we have left at the wayside and those ideas that are right we have taken with us. We don't subscribe to the rigidity demanded on dogma and scripture.

2. That this point is located 36 miles outside the maritime exclusion zone set by the UK government in the statement by its Ministry of Defence on 28 April 1982, confirming the provisions on 12 April 1982. That area is marked by a ""circle with a radius of 200 nautical miles from the 51Âº 40' South latitude and 59Â° 30' west longitude"", as stated in the declaration.

3. That such an attack is a treacherous act of armed aggression perpetrated by the British government in violation of the UN Charter and the ceasefire ordered by United Nations Security Council Resolution 502.

4. That, in the face of this new attack, Argentina reiterates to the national and global public its adherence to the ceasefire mandated by the Security Council on the mentioned resolution. It has only limited to respond to Britain's attacks, without using force beyond what is necessary to ensure the defense of their territories

Lambert may have had financial restraints to deal with but they weren't nearly as tight as he claimed (see Krulak's statement after Lamberts sacking, the released accounts that showed Lambert consistently underplayed transfer fees etc etc).

His first season was always going to be a struggle and I think he did well to keep us up.  However, from that point onwards we had a team at our disposal that was easily good enough to finish mid table.

I'd also question Gardner as being good enough to start in central midfield, and you saying Morrison is a wide man.

FWIW, if I was Pulis this is what I'd be thinking:

GK: Need an experienced keeper in case Boaz gets injured before Ben comes back. Marshall is linked. There must be a older keeper who could come in short term in the same way Lee Camp did a few seasons ago.

RB: Dawson as first choice. Chester and Gardner as back-up. We're fine.

CB: Chester and McAuley right side, Olsson and Lescott left side. Looking to bring in Fazio who, despite being right footed, played a fair amount of his career at LCB. Maybe move Lescott on for a couple of million, or Olsson.

LB: Brunt as first choice. McClean can fill in if necessary. If we keep Lescott he can cover too.

DM: Yacob is very capable, Fletcher can do a job here.

CM: Morrison gives us energy and is the closest think to a box-to-box midfielder we have. Maybe bring in a creative player to link midfield and attack (TP has said this).

RM: McManaman and Gnabry compete for this spot.

LM: Assuming Brunt, Morrison and Saido play elsewhere, we only have McClean here. Would like to see Matt Phillips.

ST: Rondon, Lambert and Saido as three main forwards. Move on one or both of Anichebe and Brown.

null,null,AnxiousMo-Fo,,Labour | Fabians | Unite,null,"Those terms *weren't* set by the Tories; they were set by the public. As I've already pointed out, the public aren't just hanging around waiting for someone to set the agenda. The reason they believed that the Tories were right about our overspending is that, as far back as 2001, people were sufficiently concerned about overspending, particularly on welfare to stop voting for the party, and that concern grew and grew for our whole time in government. Even many on the left criticised us over the expense of PFI, an argument which was usually framed as 'it isn't cost-effective'; in other words, even people on the left were getting annoyed by 'misspending', if not overspending.

People across the political spectrum tolerated that, just about, while the economy was growing, but when the bubble burst, they turned against us. Hence, the idea that Labour overspent and/or misspent is not purely a post-crash or post 2010 narrative that the Tories invented: It's a longstanding concern of a large chunk of the electorate, which the Tories exploited.

As for the SNP, the problem is basically identical. Throwing our lot in with a group of people who were actively yelling 'We're going to stop austerity' would have lost us still more votes to a public that was very much sold on the idea of austerity already. As I said, even SNP voters didn't consider austerity to be the major reason for voting SNP (although it was important), as [the study referred to in this article](http://labourlist.org/2015/07/post-referendum-slump-drove-labours-defeat-in-scotland/) shows.

By the way, even I don't think the SNP are 'good, honest people', frankly.

Found it too hard to quit using only willpower - most of my friends are quite heavy smokers so it became quite hard to break the habit, especially at the pub.

Now, because he's had two games where he's been underwhelming, he's possibly the worst player in the world and a massive flop? Come on. Revisionism and kneejerk reactions. 

Has he done enough to warrant a Â£25M price tag? No, I don't believe so and I wouldn't argue that he has.

Nevertheless, having regard to the information on the negotiating history which I have been given and to the arguments of the US Administration which I heard in Washington, I accept that a reasonable case can be made that resolution 1441 is capable in principle of reviving the authorisation in 678 without a further resolution.

Lastly, the ultimate legality of the war by relatively minor and arguably outdated UN institutions is irrelevant to me. It is the duty of the West to defend human rights and oppressed peoples abroad, so kicking and screaming about a hugely disputed resolution that may or may not have been violated really wont scratch it up for me anyway.

Good case in point, though, your landlord could have defended the case by arguing the case had not been heard in the right court. You can find more information on the Civil Procedure rules website: http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part56

Taken from someone much wiser than me:

&gt; Civil Procedure Rule 56.1(f) defines section 214 deposit protection claims as âLandlord &amp; Tenant Claimsâ and practice direction 56.2 (para 2.1) states that âlandlord &amp; tenant claimsâ have to be dealt with as a âPart 8â² claim. 
&gt; Part 8 claims have to be submitted on a different claim form (N208) and will be allocated to the âmulti-trackâ (CPR rule 8.9(c)) not the âsmall claims trackâ.
&gt; 
&gt; The claim is much more complex â the courts are less forgiving of applicants who do not follow the correct procedure or comply with instructions, potentially resulting in a claim failing. Most litigants will require the services of a solicitor
&gt; The claim is much more expensive â the court fees alone to get the hearing to court are in excess of Â£1000. Current court fees can be found [here](http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/courtfinder/forms/ex050-eng.pdf), the items a claimant would expect to pay would be the application fee, the allocation fee, pre-trial checklist and the hearing fee.
&gt; The losing party may be ordered to pay the other party's solicitors costs etc (solicitor â Â£200/hr?)
&gt;

&gt;A sequence of really amazing events are happening in mine and my friends/business partners lives right now!
We have be proactively sending positive messages out there to the universe, expressing positive thoughts and feelings and guess what!? Amazingly enough the things we have been asking for have been happening!!
I have been wishing to reconnect with old friends from my past and share with them this gift of a business I have discovered. I wished for them to be open to this opportunity and want to run with this together as business partners. The universe heard my request and put me in touch with one highly blessed individual and a friend I haven't connected with in years! I am so grateful to have reconnected with you KÃ¨ys Cosido and am so excited about launching this business with you over in the Philippines. Never have I been so sure of an epic business partnership and friendship reborn in my life. We got this my man, life is about to get seriously exciting. Let's start sending even more positivity to the universe so that there is no way we can't be successful with this!! grin emoticon
Call me a 'woo woo' type but the proof is in the pudding - I dare you to send out your message to the universe....... but make sure you mean it or the universe will know you're telling porkies! wink emoticon

The South stand is next to the away fans which is located in the South West corner meaning if you get seats there you are bound to be around those trying to shut up their fans. South East is near enough that the atmosphere and singing leaks over. Make sure you get involved though.

- **Best view:** Any upper stand to be honest but West or East upper in the middle will of course give you a great view. It tends to be quiet up there however, almost dire at times.  

- **Family orientated/quiet:** North stand, I rarely sit here and don't actually know if this is the case so someone feel free to correct me, but I've only ever had the worst atmosphere here and it seems more family orientated.

- **Up close with the action/players**: East or West lower in the mid sections if you want a decent overall view. South East corner is good for atmosphere and for when the players take corners, whether you're supporting Eriksen or abusing an away player. 

- **Tunnel/bench experience:** This is located on the West Stand so if you want to be close to that take up West Lower.

Constant barking or howling are surely not acceptable, but isn't it similar situation to loud music. I haven't seen British tenancy agreement yet, but I would expect a clause stipulating that complaints from neighbours or police may result in ending the deal immediately.

null,null,rjolly,lfc68,,null,"I like most fans will never stop supporting my team. But I have to say watching Liverpool can be so difficult sometimes. The thing is, the reason it is so difficult isn't because we are playing poor or not winning or anything like that. We all had to endure Roy Hodgson as manager and administration used in the same sentence as Liverpool. If anything that increased my support for the club.

But what honestly makes it difficult is the atmosphere. Call me dramatic or ridiculous or whatever but it is a disgrace. You hear the speakers playing YNWA and a few fans joining in and if you watch on TV the camera pans across the crowd and you just see people talking to each other and on their phones. There isn't really anything wrong with that. I mean what's wrong with talking to your mate or checking your phone but it wasnt that long ago when people would all be joining in. But the reason this annoys me is that aside from the YNWA at the end of the game the start of the game is usually the best atmosphere we give in the game. 

The rest of the game is the opposition chanting loud, cheering on their team with a few verses of fields of Anfield road, maybe chanting a players name, especially if he scores and and chanting Liverpool if we conceed. It's embarrassing. We have a ynwa at the end of the game and that's usually allright. But the rest of the match it is ridiculous. Sometimes the crowd turns up against Everton or Chelsea but how the fuck can we be outsung by Bournemouth. They've only been in the premier league 2 weeks and they are already taking the piss out of our atmosphere, singing 'where's your famous atnosphere'

I know it might seem a bit melodramatic but to me I can't stand hearing the opposition singing all game. This is Liverpool, we used to take pride in the support we gave our team. But we are no better than fans of any other team. And of course this decline in atmosphere is happening at a lot of clubs especially big clubs. It isnt just us but for a team which used to take pride in its support it is a bit embarrassing. Of course the ticket prices are a massive issue and it's actually lead to the point where away fans are usually louder at most matches in the league. But it isn't like we can't do anything about it. Of course we can. I just don't see the point in going to a match and not getting involved. 

It might seem a bit ridiculous what im saying but it is honestly difficult to watch a game where we are creating no atmosphere. That's the point in watching football. It's part of the game, it's English tradition, it's part of the fun. Fans talk about underpreforming players but the fans themselves often underpreformed. And anyone who thinks it doesn't affect the players is wrong. Whenever the players talk about Istanbul they talk about the fact they were in the changing rooms at half time, 3-0 down and heard the Liverpool fans still singing. Against Saint Etienne in 77 the fans were making it difficult for the opposition and the liverpool players thrived on it.

I'm well aware that people are trying to get ticket prices lowered to make games more accessible but that won't change overnight. What can change though is the actions of the people who go, they can get involved and create an atmosphere. I know some people don't really want to get involved because of their accent they might be from London or abroad and are worried what people might say. Who cares, it's Liverpool not a league 1 club we are going to have fans who are not local and that's a good thing.

If you're happy to not touch any money you invest for over a decade then the stock market is good place to start. We Brits have a tendency to think bricks &amp; mortar are the be all and end all of investment. Yes if you bought a place in Chelsea in the early 90s you'd have made a killing by 2015 and yes if you'd invested in stocks in 1999 you'd have had a pitiful profit 15 years later. Statistically though companies can generate greater returns on your investment than a house or flat over a long period of time, albeit with more volatility, purely because while houses increase in value from a growing population, companies can increase profits from both a growing population and improving technology (I can explain what I mean by this but itâs very long winded).

 

Over a 10+ year period stocks (with a small amount of bonds and property investment [see book advice lower down]) will generate the highest returns on your investment.  The reason people fear it is not that way is they panic and sell right at the worst time (2002 or 2008) or are overly optimistic and buy at the worst time (1999 or 2006).  I could say what specifically you should invest in but it would be unwise to throw thousands of quid at things because a stranger on the internet told you.

 

The best thing you can do before investing your hard earned cash is read âa random walk down wall streetâ.  I think this is the best of the books Iâve read for teaching an intelligent person but with limited investment knowledge about how to invest their money.  Essentially, an ultra-simple investment strategy will earn you the safest and highest returns.  Fidelity (US investment firm) found that of their clients, those with the highest returns were those who had forgotten they had money invested with them â they left it alone regardless of how the economy/market was doing.

 

If youâre still interested in discussing what you should do after that I would be happy to chat some more.",null,0,null,1440152066,null,null,1440201888,0,cuai33v,null,t3_3hrzik,null,null,null,t1_cua2lwt,null,null,null,1441381620,null,9,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,9,null

The UK is currently on an immigration ""lockdown"" because the government is trying to reduce net migration but thanks to the EU and immigrants looking for asylum they're never going to meet it so they are heavily restricting anyone who needs a visa.

The rules as they are currently look something like this:

* The employer must be registered to apply for visas, and only certain employers who can demonstrate a need for overseas workers are allowed to register.
* If the employer can register they must advertise the job throughout the entire EU and they must demonstrate that they couldn't find anyone suitable to do the job.
* If the employer meets both of the above conditions then they can apply for one of a very small number of visas that get snapped up very quickly on release.

Sorry to dampen your spirits, but it's almost impossible to get in from a non-EU country.

It's clear there's been a lot of work in preseason to experiment with a new system where Kane is dropping deeper. Knowing that he's going to be a marked man this year means he can pull the CBs away and create space for others to run into. Then with his beautiful chips over the top for our wide men to run into and play into the box means the goals can come from any of our attackers. Add a couple more pacey attackers that offer something different in there and we've got a very dangerous team. 

I'm so pleased to see Poch and the team adapting to the problems we faced last year, and it's even more clear how crucial every player on the pitch is to make this system work, justifying even further the mass clearout we've had this summer. Levy knows for Poch to have any success he has to be supported fully and only buy the players he wants, which seems so far to be happening. 

Another year of this system developing, some more smart purchases and crucial development time for our youngsters, and we're going to be a very dangerous team to play. And with a solid defence at the back...

null,null,blozzerg,null,null,null,"I've found three that I can choose from after years &amp; years &amp; years of being orange! 

My current fave and what I use most is YSL Fusion Ink shade B10. The thing is, it doesn't look pale in the bottle, but it's a bloody brilliantly match to my skin tone! Quite neutral with a slight cool yellow lean to it. It's a very lightweight formula so if you want heavier coverage it's probably not too great, but I have super uneven skin tone (really red cheeks too) and it helps give a nice natural 'no makeup' finish. I then use powder and concealer to hide unevenness, so I don't have a heavy caked on look. 

I also use Illamasqua, but go get matched before you buy as they go super super pale. I'm always the palest shade for any brand, with Illamasqua I'm like three shades in from the palest.  They do pink and yellow as well for each shade, so I use Skin Base in shade 02 which is a cooler yellow, thought it's slightly too pale for me. I use it for when I want dramatic, polished makeup looks for when I go out and need to look top notch. The formula is thicker and heavier so it covers my uneven skin tone perfectly and gives you a blank white canvas to start with. They also include with each foundation purchase a thingy which will either lighten or darken your foundation of choice, so you can custom mix a colour or use it to highlight/contour, you choose which add on you want. 

I also recommend Bobbi Brown long wear even finish foundation, I used this for years before I discovered the YSL one. Shade 'porcelain' is a great cool pale yellow based foundation. The formula is thicker than the YSL one and slightly heavier coverage, but not as heavy as the Illamasqua one. The good thing is they do powders and concealers all in the same shades they do their foundations in, so I always use their pressed powder in shade porcelain and it helps give an eve finish over the YSL foundation, the shades are quite similar. The YSL just had a more natural finish than the Bobbi brown one, which is why I switched. 

Those are the three I have tried and used and loved and would buy again &amp; again, I know they're pricey but as you know it's bloody impossible finding suitable shades from drugstore brands! They do tend to last though, I buy foundation once or twice a year and I wear it daily.

null,null,strifeblood,null,null,null,"I think the difference in the level of reactions between us, Arsenal and Barcelona losing makes sense honestly:

* PL bias. Look at how much more popular the PL is, excluding Barcelona and Real Madrid, in terms of the number of related posts, comments and upvotes. Some weeks you have relegation candidates in the PL get more attention than the 3rd to 5th best La Liga teams. There was a bit more attention about us and Arsenal.

* The reaction to the Arsenal loss was much more subdued because even the most optimistic Arsenal fans knew not meeting expectations was very realistic and could easily be expected. Plus, they're not the defending champions and it makes people are a bit less critical.

* Barcelona gets a bit more leniency since they just won the treble. People aren't that concerned at this point.

* You might say it doesn't make sense that Barcelona didn't get as much criticism as Chelsea did, but we did have an underwhelming transfer window before this. There aren't nearly as many question marks for Barcelona even with Pedro and Xavi leaving, especially with having Neymar, Suarez and Messi. Complacency with sticking to the same title winning squad is a very real thing (happened last year with City) and when we get 1 point in 2 games, you can see why people reacted how they did. 

In a weird way, I'm kind of glad that we underperformed this early. Seems like it both forced some transfer activity and might inspire us to play with motivation. Motivation can be difficult at first if you're a defending champion. Hopefully, it also forces some changes like moving on from Ivanovic, Ramires, Mikel and, to a lesser extent, Terry.

* If you want to meet the widest possible variety of people I'd recommend choosing a college with both undergrads and postgrads, and not exclusively mature students (so, not Hughes Hall etc.)
* The traditional Cambridge experience is **not** mutually exclusive with a liberal attitude. The University as a whole is much more left leaning than the UK in general, and you won't find that the old colleges are a bastion of outdated views, certainly mine isn't. If you wanted to avoid stereotypically right wing colleges then perhaps I'd say avoid St. John's, Magdalene or Peterhouse but again I'd really emphasise that these stereotypes are of limited validity. I have plenty of liberal and lefty friends in Johns, I really doubt it'd be an issue!
* As for extracurriculars, plenty of stuff is done at college level (inter college sport/competition/friendly rivalry is a big part of Cambridge life) but your choice of college will by no means seriously restrict your extracurricular activity. Most societies and clubs are University wide, and there really is something for everyone.

As for my own experience in choosing a college (I'm an undergrad btw), my big objectives were to find a central college, an old college, and a pretty college, I found Sidney Sussex was all of these so I applied. Another thing worth considering is whether you'd rather live in a smaller college which is likely to have more of a community atmosphere or not. Again Sidney is on the smaller side and this suited me very well.

My parents wanted a kid desperately of their own, its easy to say they should have adopted but I guess having your own kid is different. 

Heck as a gay guy I may adopt a kid (or at least foster an older one) which should tight the balance. 

With the increasing acceptance of same sex parenting and what not I would imagine fostering and adoption are going to become far more common. 

That said, I don't think IVF should be the same for couples who don't have a medical reason for not conceiving.

He just wasn't ready for a big club, perhaps. In fact, you could argue that Lambert's tenure perhaps highlights just how big a club Villa really are. I remember some people thought he wasn't really making much of a step up from Norwich to Villa, but if that's the case, how did he fall so far?

IMO Paul Lambert's failures were... unfortunate, more than anything. I still maintain he's a good coach. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time with us, really. I get the feeling he just wasn't ready for that big a step up.

Particularly toward the end, he had the look of a man who was barely managing to drag himself to work in the morning.

Firstly, forcing kids away from their parents because the parents suffered the misfortune of a damaged condom is bad enough, let alone parents who have gone through something like the loss of a job or spouse and no longer have enough money to support their kids. It's bad for the parents and its *awful* for the kids. 

Secondly, babies get adopted fine, but the older the kids are the less likely they are to be adopted. They often spend their lives in care, when they could just as easily be at home with a family who love, care for, and support them.

Thirdly, how does one choose which kid to give up? Well the third kid's the ""drain on taxpayer money"" right, the ""problem"", so I guess they should go. Maybe the oldest should go because they'll be able to support themselves quicker? Whoever is shoved into care one thing's for sure: they're going to grow up to be resentful of their parents, their siblings, and/or the state.

And finally: people find it hard enough to hand over a *pet* they can't afford, let alone a fucking *child*.

...amounts to ""shit, we're losing this fight we started. Jorge, say something to make them look bad.""

&gt; That at 17 hours on 2 May, the cruiser ARA General Belgrano was attacked and sunk by a British submarine in a point at 55Âº 24' south latitude and 61Âº 32' west longitude. There are 1,042 men aboard the ship. Rescue operations for survivors are being carried out.
&gt; That this point is located 36 miles outside the maritime exclusion zone set by the UK government in the statement by its Ministry of Defence on 28 April 1982, confirming the provisions on 12 April 1982. That area is marked by a ""circle with a radius of 200 nautical miles from the 51Âº 40' South latitude and 59Â° 30' west longitude"", as stated in the declaration.
&gt; That such an attack is a treacherous act of armed aggression perpetrated by the British government in violation of the UN Charter and the ceasefire ordered by United Nations Security Council Resolution 502.

That would be the resolution which demanded a complete withdrawal by Argentine forces, yes? On 3 April, yes? The one which gave the UK the option to invoke Article 51 of the United Nations Charter and claim the right of self-defence, yes?

When was the Belgrano sunk again? How much withdrawal had the Argentinians actually done by that point?

You'll also be familiar with this statement: 

*In announcing the establishment of a Maritime Exclusion Zone around the Falkland Islands, Her Majesty's Government made it clear that this measure was without prejudice to the right of the United Kingdom to take whatever additional measures may be needed in the exercise of its right of self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. In this connection Her Majesty's Government now wishes to make clear that any approach on the part of Argentine warships, including submarines, naval auxiliaries or military aircraft, which could amount to a threat to interfere with the mission of British Forces in the South Atlantic will encounter the appropriate response. All Argentine aircraft, including civil aircraft engaged in surveillance of these British forces, will be regarded as hostile and are liable to be dealt with accordingly.*

&gt; That, in the face of this new attack, **Argentina reiterates to the national and global public its adherence to the ceasefire mandated by the Security Council on the mentioned resolution.** It has only limited to respond to Britain's attacks, without using force beyond what is necessary to ensure the defense of their territories

The Falklands are not Argentina's territories. They had nothing to ""defend"". It is bullshit double speak to try to make it look like their aggression was really self defence.

Utter bullcrap.

I would urge you to consider it. Being quite new, it is not a very traditional college, BUT it is incredibly friendly and social and it sounds like you would fit in very well here.

One thing to consider is that as an MPhil, you wouldn't be living IN those old colleges anyway, so right away Wolfson has the advantage of integrating everyone, including PhDs, on campus. I firmly believe it makes social life so much better to have everyone live quite close to each other. Also, being at Wolfson totally does not stop you from going to Formal Halls at other Colleges (we have our own ones, but if you want a 'High Table' and all that traditional stuff you'll need to go to an older college) or to a traditional May Ball - I went to Clare May Ball this year and it was great!

Essentially, being at Wolfson means living a more modern, social, inclusive life while still being able to tap into the traditional stuff at other Colleges. We've also got quite a few good societies, and we're doing relatively well in sports as well. Also, don't worry about the 'mature' part - the average age is probably about 25 and we're not above having fun, we're just not quite as uncontrolled and rowdy as some Trinity Freshers away from their parents' home for the first time can be.

null,null,miomike,null,null,null,"I'm on my phone so this will likely be a set of rambling thoughts while I am a passenger on a long journey, so have some time to kill.  

I thought in the first 20 minutes we looked OK, couple of half chances, bit of nice play here and there, but were solid defensively. Romeu looked good again while still throwing himself into tackles and such. I think that can half be attributed to the somewhat easy going refereeing in the reserves league.  

Ward-Prowse was almost entirely absent in the first half, I don't think I really saw him with the ball. Second half he was much more active and had some great dead ball deliveries, and some ok play in general. I think if we gave him a bit more first team time as our attacking midfielder he'd grow into it more and help with the flow of the team a lot more than Tadic does.    

One thing I found was just that there was almost no smooth, flowing, forward play. We'd break but not get anywhere, whoever was on the ball would stop or slow down play to have a look around. We rarely looked truly cohesive. Part of that I think is that there is no leader in the middle of the park, no-one that the team is built around to make sure other players know where they should be, or be going etc.  

Wanyama looked totally disinterested at times, and gave away / was tackled too many times. However there was one point where Romeu tracked back perfectly to cover Targett going forward, and I thought ""that's what Schneiderlin used to do"". Because Big Vic isn't the most mobile of tanks, I think we definitely need to have a player like Rome to partner him. To make those intelligent, intercepting runs that Vic can't do.  

Pelle did his usual stuff, he chested down more balls than a hooker who specialises in titty fucking. Made a couple of runs but again is just not the most mobile of attackers and so, and here's our problem in attack and defense, we're so narrow in playing off Pelle which also means we condense their defense, and require our wing backs almost entirely to provide width... Meaning they need a lot of cover.  

J-Rod looked a bit sharper but not totally ready yet. Great to see him score, penalty or not. Him and ManÃ© off Pelle I reckon would work really well with a creative force in behind them but not directly off Pelle. J-Rod and ManÃ© can interchange nicely and go through the middle when necessary.  

I just think we need Ward-Prowse in the middle as an advanced playmaker behind them all. Or Tadic if he gets back a bit more.  

Ultimately the result is far from ideal, but while we conceded it wasn't the defence's fault directly, but more likely the midfield meant to close down the edge of the area. And while they sometimes looked to run a bit riot down the wings, it often didn't amount to much as long as some of the midfield were back to support.  

It made me both slightly happier, because of an ever so slight improvement in performance overall, but sad because of a poor result against not great opposition...  

But my god that fucking time wasting was ridiculous, atrocious, and down right fucking annoying. Can't blame them for playing relatively negatively, but they took it to the extreme.

It's not a class thing. I'm as working class as they come. The people there are just scum. 

I felt like a prisoner while I was there. Curtains constantly closed. The streets were always full of filthy kids smoking and swearing at the top of their voices, shirtless men sat drinking cans of Fosters in their front yards, pregnant women walking about in their pyjamas  smoking weed and constant, constant club music. 

The music never ever stopped. You could usually hear it from at least 3 directions and double glazing didn't help. We ended up sleeping with earplugs and wearing headphones during the day just to keep us from going mad. We got sick of complaining to the police pretty quickly.

I'm not usually one to whine to the police about such stupid shit, but when you've got a five year old falling asleep at school because scum want to party at 2am, it's just not fair.

We just got form letters from one of his assistants telling us how he's working hard to tackle antisocial behaviour in the town. It was always the same letter, word-for-word.

The interest rate has gone up but the monthly repayment has gone down because you had to borrow less to buy the house, because it cost less to begin with.

Deposits are set by how much money you have available in the first place and if you're paying bigger rents then you can save less towards them. The help to buy scheme is just a way of keeping house prices high whilst piling more debt on first time buyers who have little-to-no savings due to high rents.

That said, you can get pretty good baguettes and stuff around the Notre Dame, even though there are lots of tourists there. Just don't go to a chain like Paul etc. 

- For museums, you'll probably want to do the Louvre but it can be hit and miss depending on whether you actually enjoy that kind of thing. Because it's August I bet it will be heaving as well. So you might be better off going somewhere like the MusÃ©e d'Orsay which I quite like. Pompidou can be good, it just depends on what the exhibition is because sometime's it's boring.

- Walk everywhere if you have the time. Seriously, Paris is tiny. The tube is good for long distances but most of the touristy stuff is all walking distance, great atmosphere just walking around.

null,null,auntie-matter,null,null,null,"Considering that the definition of poverty is ""people below 60% of median income"" you can use that figure to determine how many people are in poverty.

That definition wasn't just pulled out of the air at random, it clearly has some utility.

Perhaps it would help if you thought of all the various metrics as bricks, from which you can build a picture of a society. Yes, individually each brick perhaps isn't all that useful, but take them all together and they can make a useful structure. If you keep taking bricks out because on their own you think they're not as useful as the bigger picture, sooner or later you end up without a structure at all. The GINI Index is a pretty good metric too, but it doesn't measure everything. So you add to it with ""Poverty"" and all sorts of other stuff.

Individually all the metrics in that IFS document I linked to are fairly useless in terms of formulating policy, because single measures always are - but they're all indicators of the overall situation. On a larger scale than policy forming, some of those metrics are good enough to indicate the rough level of a problem. ""Poverty"" is considered by quite a lot of people to be one of those metrics.

So it turns out that if you run the numbers and create a different index, the 60% of median cutoff is actually pretty accurate, although possibly a little bit low. See http://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/files/jrf/poverty-definitions.pdf and http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/minimum-income-2009

But it's not just about accuracy. Sure, if we know that the ""poverty"" rate is a few % too low compared to different measurements, we can correct figures. But we've been measuring poverty using median income cutoff for decades. It's much easier to see trends when you keep using the same measurements. 

Trends are far more important than absolute accuracy, especially if your error bars are consistent. It doesn't matter if 20.5% of people are reported as in poverty but the real figure is 21.2%, what matters is whether that figure is going up or down in relation to policy changes. If you know the error rate - which we do - it's easy to correct for if and when you do something - eg: reduce council tax rates on the poorest 21.2% of households rather than the bottom 20.5%. 

Also, in terms of actually talking about poverty rates, the poverty rate is a fairly useful figure to look at. If you want to talk about something other than poverty, then maybe you should look at another measurement. But this discussion was originally about poverty. You obviously disagree with how poverty is defined, but perhaps you should take that up with the organisations who define poverty. I'll admit that I'm not sure who that is, but it is an agreed upon EU standard so I'd suggest starting in Brussels somewhere. It might help to have a better suggestion than the currently agreed standard.

Finally, I might suggest that when the Tories are trying to redefine something to make a figure lower (like how they constantly redefine ""unemployed"" to drag the numbers down) then that's an indication that the figures might have something to them.

Hopefully you are slowly scaling up use of the 10% AHA not going in daily right away, also slathering on broad spectrum sunscreen since AHAs can be photosensitising. They do not get inside the pore only act on the surface of the skin.

Be aware not everyone can tolerate one acid exfoliant daily let alone two, or some areas of skin may tolerate it and not others (mouth area tends to be sensitive). You may wish to alterate the AHA and BHA.

null,null,dontsteponthecrack,pardew,Pardew,null,"Your passion for the HF and the banners is genuinely great and you're right that without them the club is just another club. I am sure Parish and co feel the same and whether you like it or not, they're more heavily invested in this than any of the HF are, so their self serving interests need the HF too.

The way H&amp;S works is on a scale, and certain things trigger it and certain things don't. To answer the spilled hot drinks point, it can be easily explained by the club that hot drinks in appropriate containers, served to adults who you can reasonably assume are used to handling hot drinks creates a very small risk of injury. Palace can point to Costa and Starbucks serving their drinks this way and show that industry leaders serve their drinks the same way thus they do not need to innovate some new way to police hot drinks. However (and feel free to correct me, but I think this was the case when I worked at Selhurst a millennia ago) the public are stopped from bringing in flasks full of hot drinks, because they could be chucked over others or players.

This kind of metric applies to stuff like the red and blue paper on the seats etc - the chance of one catching fire is acceptably low risk, the chance of one thousand catching fire infinitesimally low so it doesn't need a plan.

I appreciate this has the potential to come across as condescending but bear with me.

Think about a banner that is going to be hung above peoples heads or draped across peoples heads, all of a sudden that's a really different risk because of its size and if someone complains to the HSE or if Palace have an HSE inspection, which they likely have annually like most companies then potentially it's been put on a problem list out of palaces control.

Fire retardant paint and material is easy and not very expensive. Admittedly more expensive than without it, but why not fund raise a bit at each match or something? I know an HF cake bake sale might be a bit twee but you never know. Ask parish for some funds if we stay up.

All theatre curtains are made retardant. Aeroplane materials like the seat covers, carpets etc.

Palace not getting sued is not the same as censorship. Parish and co aren't stopping the banners they are asking for communication on the banners. Give them plenty of warning of what they'll say and you'll be able to negotiate the wording. The HF won't be upset Romans dirty money becomes Romans dodgy money. 
I think you'll be surprised by their ability to agree language you like. They will have PR and lawyers trying to scare them into big bills and that's really the only reason I'm sure, all corporations have a level of censorship - look at the Blackpool twitter account, I'd rather not have palace like that.

Don't forget that the stewards need to be both empowered and controlled by the club. If the HF don't give the club fair warning, it gives the stewards the ability to throw their toys. However if the club and HF are on the same page then the stewards can fuck off. Try and see that this is an olive branch to empowering the HF over the stewards, to shut the stewards down and remove any stewards on a power trip from the equation. 

Give this a chance, it is not draconian. They are not banning the banners, they are asking HF to evolve into something they can work with and hopefully support. They have to defend the HF to the EPL and the FA and the HSE because it happens in their stadium.

It's 2015 in a world of political correctness and health and safety gone mad, HF can demonstrate that they are adults able to evolve with the club too.

The them and us is all palace and the rest of the world, don't make it within palace. You don't know me and I'm a random internet person, but despite my lack of interest in the banners I like what modern palace and the HF have become.

It says more about the HF if they can't comply with something simple. If there is serious censorship, or the fire labellings become too onerous you have a complaint, but at the moment I honestly don't see it.

Islam as a whole does this? Sigh. Look the people fighting against ISIL are also Muslims. The problem is we have made the Muslims who do the whole extreme things the voice and face of Islam. 

Not the moderates. 

A simple issue. Pre-Stunned Halal. You know whenever someone talks about Halal meat being conscious when it is slaughtered is talking about around 5 to 10% of total Halal meat and a single Halal Certification board. The MAJORITY of Halal meat in the UK is stunned (it's cheaper since you can slaughter faster to boot) unlike Kosher meat. 

These are all issues in Islam and here are Muslims fighting against terrorism, totalitarianissm, poverty and the like but you rarely get to hear about them. 

Let's take India. India is one of the few countries that can put satellites up into space. Why? A Muslim Scientist helped India's rocket program and space (and Missile) program and was President of India for a time. No one's holding him up as an example of a Muslim but they are holding up Anjem ""2+2=Potato"" Choudhary. 

It's like... Imagine if all of America thought the UK was filled with people from TOWIE and Geordie Shore. No James Bond, No Stephen Fry, Just Screeching Idiots With More Muscle than Brains getting drunk and fighting and doing whatever weird rolling duvet dance that constitutes sex on that show.

It involved researching ways to do an experiment first, but that stage was always done by the teachers and then we just had to pick one to follow. If it hadn't been done like that, it would have taken yet another hour (in the IT rooms) to do. 

You then did the experiment (which was always either childishly simple or involved equipment no school has) and got no marks for actually doing it. You then had to draw a table for 2 marks, and the rest was made up by exam papers, but done in a classroom rather than an exam hall, so invigilated by teachers whose performance depended on our grades rather than the impartial grannies who did the normal exams, and made up of mostly questions that could have been on the end of year exams instead.

I did seven ISAs overall, for the three sciences, and each one took 4-5 hours to complete. With the curriculum full anyway, there was no time to do them, and the retakes had to take place on weekends.

The whole thing doesn't test your ability at science but how well you can write to a strict frame. We were given writing frames for each of the questions first, because the mark scheme is so strict and the questions so vague that you need to be told what to write first in order to get anywhere with it.

It was a great idea to have a practical element to the science GCSEs, but executed very poorly.

Edit: I am not really seeing anything concrete:

&gt; A new kind of politics: a fairer, kinder Britain based on innovation, decent jobs and decent public services.

Buzzwords!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

&gt; Growth not austerity â with a national investment bank to help create tomorrow's jobs and reduce the deficit fairly. Fair taxes for all - let the broadest shoulders bear the biggest burden to balance the books.

Yeah good luck with that. Why should I have to pay back more if I get into the higher ends of the middle class, when I am in the lower middle class, that's unfair on me.

Why should the successfull business owners who worked their entire lives to get where they are, pay more to help those who don't want to help themselves.

&gt; A lower welfare bill through investment and growth not squeezing the least well-off and cuts to child tax credits.

But how will you achieve a lower welfare bill. Where will the investment go, where will the growth come from.

&gt; Action on climate change - for the long-term interest of the planet rather than the short-term interests of corporate profits.

How will you achieve this, when you want to dimish Britains military capabilities, thus reducing our role in the world.

&gt; Public ownership of railways and in the energy sector - privatisation has put profits before people.

And Monopolisation leads to stagnation, how will he ensure this doesn't happen.

&gt; Decent homes for all in public and private sectors by 2025 through a big housebuilding programme and controlling rents.

Where are these houses going to be built, will it damage the environment around it, will it be built on green belt sites?

&gt; No more illegal wars, a foreign policy that prioritises justice and assistance. Replacing Trident not with a new generation of nuclear weapons but jobs that retain the communitiesâ skills.

If there is no more trident, how can you retain the jobs. There was only one illegal war mate, and that was what your party did. Oh you also want to talk to the argies? yeah good luck with that.

&gt; Fully-funded NHS, integrated with social care, with an end to privatisation in health.

How can we fund all this, when our population is aging and people are getting fatter. There should be more of a focus on stopping diseases in its tracks and obesity, not waiting for them to get to that position.

&gt; Protection at work â no zero hours contracts, strong collective bargaining to stamp out workplace injustice.

Actually, we should keep zero hours, but bring in legislation that stops exploitation. What is this ""strong collective bargaining"" I hope its not powerful unions doing what they did in 1979.

&gt; Equality for all â a society that accepts no barriers to everyoneâs talents and contribution. An end to scapegoating of migrants.

Buzzwords again. That's not concrete at all.

&gt; A life-long national education service for decent skills and opportunities throughout our lives: universal childcare, abolishing student fees and restoring grants, and funding adult skills training throughout our lives

The Loan system isn't that unfair, most people won't pay it back, so why should we worry about it. How can we fund all these adult skills, without putting the burden too much on the rich.

There we go, this is what I saw, and frankly, its not clear at all. Its full of buzzwords, promises and pandering. There's no numbers or facts to back his positions up.

Let's look at the big problem in the Middle East. It's basically Game of Thrones and the USA's Sansa Stark. Screwing it up with good intentions and shoddy idealism and poor research. 

In the UK last year there were as many acts of terror committed by Muslims as by White Nationalists. We do not judge ALL White People or even ALL White Nationalists by the metric of that man who attacked a Sikh Dentist. Yet all Muslims are responsible for the actions of their wankers. 

There are bigger social and political issues in play than just ""blind faith"" at play here. 

And you fail to see the point. These attacks were never news. When a young man was stabbed and killed in Whitehall in the 70's the discussion was ""why is everyone so angry, it's ony an Asian"". The people who endured that level of racism in the UK are still around. My grandmother is still around and she remembers when Indians were often treated as property. 

THe fact is this sort of racism was around in my childhood and we fought against it. The reason Pubs and Football Games are safer are distinct drives to cut down on the racism. You know how horrified people are about those Chelsea fans? Remember the racism in Eastern And Central Europe, that was the norm once. Not once. In the late 80s and early 90s. 

Do you know why Muslims are alienated? It's not that they do not drink but that they are often pushed out of conversations by events such as this which makes them worry. 

Note how you made this about Rotherham and ISIL and Al-Qaeda rather than about the alienation and the targetting of people who have done nothing by ethnicity.

There's this entitlement on the part of our fans that they should be watching a team capable of taking the title and anything less than that apparently isn't worth putting effort in to get behind. 

The type of average fan at games has changed from people in their mid-20s looking to belt out songs to support their team, to middle-aged men who are happy enough going to the game just to get some space from the wife and kids for a couple of hours and to moan about how all the players now are earning ten times as much and yet wouldn't have even made the bench in the 1983 side. And those people will keep renewing their season tickets and going to the game because they can afford to, and because they know they'll struggle to ever regularly get tickets again if they stop. 

People blame ticket prices, or tourists going to the game, but fact is both of those aspects were still around at the end of the 2013/14 season when we were top of the league and the atmosphere at Anfield for those last few home games was electric. The difference is for those games people actually gave a shit for once, because they suddenly had a glory-hunting reason to give a shit. The atmosphere at Anfield *can* be good, it just takes a reason for the fans to actually make it so, because apparently most of them won't bother to do it themselves.

The Data Protection rules say (simplifying a lot) that companies can't process someone's personal data without a good reason, and people can object to their personal data being processed.

A couple of years ago some Spanish guy sued Google (because a search for his name turned up a link to something negative but outdated about him near the top, that would otherwise be effectively impossible to find) arguing that this rule applied to search engines as well as everyone else.

It was kind of embarrassing; after nearly 20 years of this rule being around, no one had stopped to consider that search engines process personal data and so might have to comply with data protection laws as well - it has just been assumed that the law didn't apply to them.

In theory the rules apply to everyone - including Bing and Yahoo. In practice, no one cares about them - particularly in the media. When the first ruling happened, Google may have exaggerated the effect (understandably) and this hasn't helped with understanding the issue.

The ""right to be forgotten"" was initially a proposal in the EU's overhaul of data protection laws. But it was controversial so more or less abandoned.

null,null,mostlyharmless93,null,null,null,"No not too personal at all, I studied chemistry at Bradford. Now the only thing that is off campus is the business and management building IIRC. So I'm wondering if you will be staying next to the school of management (unlikely I don't think they have any dedicated student halls but I'm not sure.) or at the ""Green"" (the campus student halls). There is a dedicated bus that goes between both the main campus and the school of management , so you will probably be spending time between the main uni area and the school of management depending on lectures.

So there is a organised trip in [freshers week to go to Ikea](http://www.ubuonline.co.uk/events-and-entertainment/trips/) (the large swedish deparntment store) which should have all of the bedding and stuff but the large morrisions and tesco will also have some bedding along with the primark in kirkgate shopping centre.

Amount of work will dependent on if this is your masters year or just a international year but ive heard that compared to other countries universities we have a lot less lecture time, and I felt that university work is alot more independent requiring you to put in more work than being told what to do. however your course may be far different. The good thing is that there will be plenty of time to take up a few societies along with being part of a sports team. But time management is defiantly something you learn even if your not on a management course :) because trying to find a balance between work and fun is what university is about.

I'm not the biggest footie fan but the westliegh and the university's sports bar usually has all the big matches on and has a nice welcoming student environment.

Getting a degree that gets you a job is very important so its not too personal at all, and seeing as I'm not employed by the uni any more (I used to be a student ambassador for chemistry) I can be quite honest. Business and management is a very good course and would rank it among Bradfords best courses along with optometry and of course chemistry. This is because the university itself prides itself with a good graduate employment. The uni has even taken steps to help me get a job over the last few months after I had graduated. 

Luckily I have managed to get a full time job even before the uni offered help to find a graduate job, the downside is I'm not in Bradford any more and working a full time job. So I might not be back in Bradford for a while however I will defiantly message you to meet up when I do.

You probably have seen some of the websites but I thought I would link you all the helpful ones and FB pages that you might need :

I have a theory that if it wasn't for our interest in Adama, we wouldn't have signed Crespo, or maybe not even known of him. In his interview with the club Adama said Villa were one of the first clubs to show interest in him which must have been very early this summer. We all know that Sherwood went to Spain and returned 2-3 days before we signed Crespo. I think he went to speak to Adama and his representatives then, and since the same people represent Crespo, I think they brought up Crespo to Tim and his availability with the cheap release clause and a day or two later we had Crespo signed.

Second, I think after watching a couple games I think we have our own Danny Welbeck in Jordan Ayew. I think they're both around the same age, score the same kind of goals and play in a similar way. I think if we could somehow use Ayew like England use Welbeck, it could be fruitful.

This isn't just some law that was created by scholars - these are all Sharia states. The law of these lands is taken literally from the Quran - the book that to Muslims, is the ""final word of God"". This means there is never any chance of a reform as there has been in Christianity. 

I don't give a shit about the preparation of Halal meat. I think it's just people being offended for the sake of it. But I do think it's quite disgraceful that some places make all meat halal, so that 5% of the population get preference over the rest. You don't see jews kicking up a big fuss about places that don't have kosher meat.

There is a very logical reason for this, and if you can't see it, you're an idiot. The Muslim scientist didn't help India's rocket program in the name of Allah.

After finding the best deal you can on the mortgage comparison website, phone the mortgage lender. It will probably be to a call centre, they'll run through and do a mortgage in principle. This will confirm whether you can actually borrow what you want from them. Different mortgage lenders have different specifications. They will do a soft credit check and from what I understand, even if they find they can't lend what you've asked for, this will not effect your credit rating.

Once you have this mortgage in principle you can be relatively confident you will get the mortgage you want from that provider. Then take it from there. You have an offer accepted so can book an appointment to see if you can indeed get that mortgage.

I do not think you need specialist advice/mortgage broker unless you are utterly and completely confused here. I do not believe they can offer anything that isn't publicly available.

My best suggestion, if possible, is an outlet centre, worth a trip if you ask me. Got my last two suits from my local one (Gloucester quays). First was from suits direct (online as well I think - but you really want to be trying them on. Was Hugo boss, really nice style for 120 and two shirts for 30. My second trip was even better as went into the Calvin Klein shop as my mums partner wanted a look (assumed this was out of my budget etc), they had loads of suit under 150 including a good selection of ex display models which means I got a merino wool Calvin Klein suit for 130 and it was for the autumn/winter season that iirc hadn't quite gone on sale yet or had literally just gone on sale where the new suit was something ridiculous like 800 quid.

ISIS are indeed being fuckheads. The kind of fuckheads who hide amongst innocent civilians and fight the kind of guerilla war that kept the Soviet Union busy in Afghanistan for decades and sent the Americans home from Vietnam with their tails between their legs.

The fact that rape victims are the only ones to be exempt from this change in law is implying that being poor and having kids, or even just having unprotected sex, is a bad behaviour to be discouraged. 

Admittedly these things cannot always be planned for, but it's reasonable to expect people to pay most of the costs of having a child. Ergo if you have no hope of doing so you shouldn't have kids, as they will suffer from your inability to provide.  

As for unprotected sex, outside of long term relationships that's pretty irresponsible. I hardly think it's that scandalous if the government is discouraging it.

Plus, they tried splitting once before (with the SDP) and that was a disaster, and the Lib Dems (who might have been a receptacle for defections) are both battered and sickly and (under Farron) anticipating their own leftward lurch.

Do you think the victims of ISIS suffer more than the victims of US bombs? They are dying needless, horrendous deaths either way.

&gt; You're examples are completely different to the ISIS example  and you know it. Not like ISIS then.

My point is that ISIS are doing it as a response to the torture that the US has been doing. Water boarding is drowning.

The other torture victim had these things done to him:

* A black hood pulled over his head limiting his ability to breathe
* Knee strikes to the abdomen
* Over 100 peroneal strikes (a nerve behind the kneecap)
* Shoved against a wall
* Pulled by his beard
* His bare feet stepped on
* Kicks to the groin
* Chained to the ceiling for extended hours, depriving him of sleep
* Slammed his chest into a table front

And he died... That isn't dissimilar to the torture that ISIS does.


&gt; The example you show is from the 1991 war and nothing to do with Fallujah.

I haven't been talking about Fallujah. Corbyn just brought it up as one example of atrocity in the US lead wars. And again, intent really didn't matter to that soldier who was burned alive in the picture. That is what war looks like, it is terrible when ISIS or the US does it.

&gt; That the tactics used by western forces goverened by their own protocols and rules of engagement are nowhere like the activities of ISIS.

&gt;In the UK last year there were as many acts of terror committed by Muslims as by White Nationalists.

There is a terror related arrest DAILY.

&gt;We do not judge ALL White People or even ALL White Nationalists by the metric of that man who attacked a Sikh Dentist.

That's not quite true. Some of you have nasty attitudes towards us. 

&gt;Yet all Muslims are responsible for the actions of their wankers. 

There are large problems within the muslim communities that are not being dealt with.

&gt;There are bigger social and political issues in play than just ""blind faith"" at play here. 

I'm well aware. It doesn't detract from the problems caused by those who identify as muslim. And blind faith is the recruitment catalyst.

&gt;THe fact is this sort of racism was around in my childhood and we fought against it. The reason Pubs and Football Games are safer are distinct drives to cut down on the racism. You know how horrified people are about those Chelsea fans? Remember the racism in Eastern And Central Europe, that was the norm once. Not once. In the late 80s and early 90s. 

I am too young to know anything substantial. I was brought up to treat all as equal, to be fair, to be open minded. I was completely indifferent about islam and muslims until muslims popped my blissful bubble.

&gt;Do you know why Muslims are alienated? It's not that they do not drink but that they are often pushed out of conversations by events such as this which makes them worry. 

How does this push them out of conversations? I've noticed that muslims go quiet and stop the conversation when you ask them for an explanation. I believe it's because they cannot give one - they either admit the quran is a fairy tale or they endorse it, warts n all - I understand this is the logic behind ISIS recruitment? I had a muslim chap I went to college with on facebook - I saw a post of him stating we should have sharia law, I posted on there about how safe me and my family would be and instead of answering the question, he said he's sorry that the media have made me islamophobic. Shame really - at least you are trying to converse.

&gt;Note how you made this about Rotherham and ISIL and Al-Qaeda rather than about the alienation and the targetting of people who have done nothing by ethnicity. 

I didn't bring those into it. I could have pulled from an infinitely long list any number of events. Also, nobody cares about whether muslims feel alienated when muslims are raping white kids in an organised fashion, when they are teaching their children to hate the kaffir, when people have to live under 24/7 protection because they offended muslims...muslims are going to be alienated until muslims (as a whole) knock off the sick shit they do.

Sorry, but Corbyn is absolutely unelectable.  His fringe views are off the charts insane.  This is a guy who professed admiration for Venezuela's economic policies and thinks that the US is morally just as bad as ISIS.  Seems he's never met a holocuast denier he doesn't like and he's chummy with every terrorist organisation from Belfast to the Gaza strip.  His foreign policy could have been written by Putin and his economic policy by Marx.  I can't think of any scenario in which he could win a general election, short of the Conservatives managing to en masse fall into a 50 foot pit.

null,null,IxionS3,null,null,null,"&gt; usually it's 2 months for a general election from vague memory

It kind of depends, and is also likely to change.  Historically Parliament had a maximum life of years but the PM had the power to call a general election (well, technically the monarch did but they followed the ""advice"" of the PM) at any time, and they generally didn't go down to the wire.  The time from the PM making the call to the polling date was 6 weeks or so.  

Thus the date of the next election was generally not known far in advance, at least with 100% certainty (speculation about when the PM would ""go to the country"" was a staple of political reporting, and I'm sure all parties had their theories and contingency plans).  This limited the full on campaigning to a shortish period.

That changed with the [Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/contents/enacted).  That set the date of the most recent election and removed the PMs power to trigger future elections, instead stating that they will take place on a fixed 5 year cycle unless the Commons vote otherwise.

Assuming that stands (and before the election there were mutterings that some Conservatives would like to repeal it) then we could see the election season growing as the parties adapt to the new environment.  On the other hand I think there's a lot less money for campaigning in UK politics than in the USA, which may limit this.",null,0,null,1440162486,null,null,false,0,cualo18,null,t3_3hu442,null,null,null,t1_cuaj8cu,null,null,null,1441383372,null,1,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

I'm generally more sympathetic to NHS treatments for people who have suffered from life-threatening injuries or diseases to help them return to a normal quality of life.  While not getting these treatments also won't kill you, without them, your quality of life is likely to be permanently impaired because of a medical condition that you have had.  

To me, IVF and ED treatments are in the same category as elective plastic surgery.  It's just human nature that some of us are more able to conceive, get erections, or have bigger breasts or less droopy faces than others.

Hard to agree with that. Before we signed otamendi he had a clear path to the team. Demi would retire and then he'd be 3rd choice, where he'd play enough to stake a claim.

Now though, even if he goes away for 2 years, he'll come back to Mangala (26) Otamendi (29) and Kompany (31). Who will presumably have played together for 2 years as well and be very good together.

Is he going to knock one of those out of the team? Are we going to sell one of them?

This is done for the benefit of the child as much as anything. 

If you look to adopt abroad, then along with these problems, you've got to deal with the additional adoption requirements of that country- some only adopt to married couples, some require residency in that country for a period, you might actually have to pay a bribe to officials, fees to non-citizens can be very high in any case and there are often restrictions on citizens from certain countries (prime example being Dima Yakovlev laws forbidding Russian adoptions by American citizens).",null,0,null,1440163105,null,null,false,0,cualz7j,null,t3_3hr7l1,null,null,null,t1_cua07h8,null,null,null,1441383519,null,7,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

I have no doubt that he'll be a decent player in a few years. 

But I've actually watched a fair number of Lyon games last season. The guy is not a good crosser. His decision making is quite poor. He often doesn't know whether to go for goal or place a pass. 

And he is fucking tiny. Sure, he has pace. But we aren't primarily a counter-based team. Sometimes we do counter, but most of our chances come from the opposing team having 9 or 10 men behind the ball. You need to be physical for that type of play. Clinton is not strong. He's easily, very easily, pushed off the ball. 

So yes, I haven't seen him play at Spurs. A bit tautological seeing as he hasn't played at Spurs, isn't it? 

But I've seen him at Lyon and he's not the solution to our current problem. If we were already stacked with quality players in that position, I'd be fine with getting him for the future. 

But we aren't. We're consistently left out on the right. Walker becomes our only outlet and we end up getting caught out at the back because of it.

One should concentrate on what your actions do rather than whether they're ""left-wing"" or ""right-wing"" methods.  

For example, if using the private sector in the NHS leads to decreased waiting times for patients in certain circumstances this is an acceptable short-term method until the resources are available for the NHS to provide it ""in-house"".

The other point I would make is that most leaders from the fringes talk a big game then once they get into power are much more centrist than one might expect.  You can see that in recent examples like the Lib Dems in coalition; SNP in Holyrood; and Syriza in Greece. All campaigned on the left then governed much closer to the centre.

Realistically, we should have 2 points. We were battered in the first half against Stoke and it was a wonderstrike from Coutinho to score that goal. The goal against Bournemouth should never have been given and their goal that was called back was, in all honesty, a goal. 

I've seen nothing to suggest that we're not going to get battered by Arsenal. I'll be genuinely surprised if we can score a goal against them if the XI from the first 2 games takes the field against them. If Firmino, Can and Sakho start I'd be more confident, but if Lallana and Lovren are out there we're totally done for. That left side, whether it's Moreno or Gomez at left back, is vulnerable just by virtue of Lovren being there.

null,null,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,null,"Labour is supposed to be the party for everyone. At the moment it seems like a place for a cosy elite of liberals that make fun of the working class for people (e.g. white van man). They want to make it this exclusive club where people talk about just how bad homelessness or poor healthcare is whilst sending little Tristram to his public school and upgrading their BUPA membership. They think that reading Polly Toynbee in the guardian every week allows their aspirations to justify political inaction.

This is not what labour is for. Labour was founded for the fight for a better life for everyone. Excluding people for any reason, is how they hold on to the cosy centre. If Corbyn loses this election though gerrymandering this will be the apocalypse for the party because they will loose their entire base. Too long have they costed on the votes of working class people and taken them for granted. How can any of the centre-right candidates win a general election if they can't even get labour's base to vote for them?

Edit: just read this [buzz feed link](www.buzzfeed.com/solomonhughes/yvette-coopers-biggest-donation-comes-from-an-ex-tory-donor#.dgzOaNLpdd).

That was a great season, wasn't it? Even then, go check out what the scorelines looked like in the beginning of that season. First 3 matches? 1-0 wins. We weren't blitzing teams from the get go of the season, it takes time for the team to find cohesion &amp; understand each others' movements, where they want the ball, etc. 

Give it some time, but also, don't expect 13/14 type of football. It's a standard that any team would find hard to meet. But I do expect us to get much more fluidity in our football over the next few weeks.

Or that he thinks that there's some kind of moral equivalence between ISIS and the US.  Or that he's a fan of Kremlin mouthpiece - Russia Today and is the Russians' favoured candidate.

And 'moderate left'?  He's on the extreme fringe of the Labour party.  He's perhaps the most hard-left MP in the entire party and has rebelled more than any other MP against his party's whip.  He has practically no support within the PLP and many MPs are seriously considering a split if he's elected.

I'll post what I put elsewhere:

&gt;Look at where most of the chances have been created against us. 

&gt;Look at all the crosses that Diouf was on the end of that came all from that side.

&gt;Look how far up Walker was when he had to get back to try and stop Rooney against ManU.

&gt;Look how exposes our middle becomes when the CMs have to drop back to the right in order to cover the swath of space exposed.

2) I could go further with Yarmo. The Ukranian league requires quite a lot of its wingers. He's often very far back when defending and is quite a good tackler. He has a good footballing brain. He isn't easily dispossessed. He has a rocket of a shot. He's a seasoned international who has a leadership role for his club and country. 

3) I've been quite happy with our buys this window. Primarily because they've all been quality signings who could, not will, step in and fill positions. This is the first of the signings that it seems we'll have to wait a while before we see some fruit from him in the PL. 

Again, I'm fine with the signing. I think he'll develop into a decent player. But it's frustrating to be playing players out of position and exposing an entire flank because we don't have someone who can get the job done on the RM/RW.

Yes, some ""buzzwords"" are present. Writing just cold hard lists doesn't tend to appeal to people.

The idea that those who can afford a greater tax burden should support those who are under most pressure is the foundation of all left-wing politics, more or less. The way tax brackets work means you're never earning less money, you're just increasing the amount you earn by slightly less. Also, a 50% top rate of tax is hardly astonishing - even Thatcher ran a higher rate than that.

Broadly if you invest in the economy through stimulus and infrastructure you provide more and better jobs, which means that fewer people fall back onto welfare. Other projects, that require investment upfront, also reduce welfare spending - social housing, for example, is far more cost effective than paying out housing benefit.

Military capabilities are not the only way to be effective in international politics, and certainly not the way to be best placed to take action on climate change. Britain used to be famed for diplomacy and trade - that was phenomenally effective on the world stage and nations that still go that route (like China, Scandinavian countries, Germany, etc) are very effective.

It is important to note that Corbyn is not proposing a monolithic public institution, but rather publicly owned services. The plural is important, because it means you'll have multiple participants in each sector, they will just be publicly owned and accountable to the public.

New house building almost certainly will be built on green belt sites, yes - there simply arent enough brownfield sites to support the number of houses needed. Honestly, the housing crisis has reached such serious levels that basically all parties and factions thereof (apart from the Greens) are looking at altering green belt restrictions.

The point is that you go reinvest the money that would have gone to Trident into other sectors, and to other parts of the armed forces. Many of these sectors provide a much stronger employment return on investment than Trident, and Trident has very large sunk costs for basic establishment. Corbyn voted against the war at the time, and plans to apologise on behalf of the party for the war if he was wins. The Iraq war is extremely contentious within the party, and many members feel ashamed of Labour's part in it. It is not reasonable to accuse him because of the actions of people he is actively opposing. He does indeed wish to negotiate further with Argentina, because he believes we are better served by effective diplomacy - a tactics which has provided correct in multiple cases.

PFI, private contracts on be NHS and other privatisation efforts are all much more expensive that infrastructure spending from central government. All Corbyn is advocating is returning to the mechanism of funding that was used by every government before New Labour, regardless of who was in power. Obesity is an issue, but an ageing population is more pressing, and here are no real ways at current of stopping it before it happens. Finding the most cost-effective ways of dealing with the situation is what is vital, and doing that publicly is demonstrably cheaper.

I actually agree with you on the zero hours thing, I don't have much counter to that. But the collective bargaining thing is about providing updates to union procedures that would mean they are actually much more representative- like allowing electronic ballots, which the Tories have repeatedly refused to institute. He also has policies which would place worker representatives (unions or otherwise) on board of directors, something which works extremely well on many places including Germany.

There is a huge issue in the UK at the moment to do with skills - adult workers who require new skills or updated skills find that provisions are either absent or prohibitively expensive. All Corbyn is suggesting here is that we have a system in place to ensure that adult education is accessible and regulated so we can provide qualifications that are recognisable and useful. It wouldn't require vast amounts of investment - it's more about joining us existing services. As for student loans/fees, if the overwhelming majority arent paid back, what exactly is the point of making it a loan? The economic benefit for the nation of a graduate is greater than the cost of the tuition, so really giving grants pays for itself.


None of these things, with perhaps the exception of Trident and NATO, are radical policies - they are more similar to the status quo of countries like Germany and Sweden than to some socialist utopia.

null,null,tigernmas,irish,Daon-Phoblacht na hÃireann,null,"&gt; The traditional Left favoured atheism (although there were the methodists etc. as well) but the 'ally-hood' with Islam seems bizarre given that they often actually execute socialists and are hardly progressive on gay rights, women's rights etc.

The traditional Left sees religion as a reflection of social and economic conditions. Attacking people because of their religion will just cause conflict. Attacking the social and economic base of religion allows it to die out without that conflict.

So the relationship with Islam is more like this. As citizens they should be afforded the same rights as anyone else to participate and be heard in the society in which they live and have freedom of religion. Attacking them for their religion or their religion itself (like those people that start trawling through the fucking Koran to find gotcha quotes about violence or what have you) will achieve very little other than strengthen the far-right and Wahhabist narratives of a war between Islamic and Christian civilisation. Instead make them included and give them a stake in society and improve their social and economic conditions so that they generally stop turning to religion like the rest of us godless heathens.

Meanwhile, outside of that, Wahhabism needs to be opposed and isolated by targeting it specifically and not Islam as a whole. It's Saudi backing also needs to be opposed and the West in general needs to take its nose out of the middle east both politically and economically. And while we're at it all leftists in predominantly Muslim countries need to be supported along with their feminists and LGBT+ activists but not in a top down ""stand back, we'll save you"" manner. On top of that the Left is massively in love with the YPG in Syria which is liberating women, setting up a radical democratic society and smashing the Wahhabist reactionaries.

So essentially we see religion as something to be killed off in a systemic way rather than an individual conversion to atheism way while at the same time opposing all forms of reactionary politics in all parts of the world.",null,0,null,1440165323,null,null,false,0,cuan656,null,t3_3hpgo0,null,null,null,t1_cu9ve9p,null,null,null,1441384081,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

That's usually the worst way to try and deal with someone you don't agree with, in what way do you think Jeremy Corbyn will not act as an effective leader?  Because the media says he won't? Because you don't personally like him?  Your opinion is hardly an effective deterrent to people who may wish to vote for Jeremy Corbyn.  

I'm criticising the validity of their arguments, because I also believe it has been an ugly twisting of the facts, not actually a 'stripping of the bark'. By the way I'm not even voting Corbyn, so just step off.  I personally think that he might actually be an effective opposition to the Conservatives, which sadly seems lacking from his leadership competitors, who have for the most part have run a mediocre, business as usual, Ed Miliband style campaign, certainly from the eyes of many who have become disillusioned with the usual politics by numbers we've seen in recent years.  

In the same way The Spectator is allowed to criticise Jeremy Corbyn, I should be allowed to criticise their stance on certain issues and how they've covered this whole sorry affair.  Or should we all bow down to the God-Kings of the Conservative press and wait for their blessings when they decide to endorse the Labour party again, though I won't be holding my breath for that day.

You could get a two bedroom semi or a three bedroom terrace for Â£600 a month in Ipswich. Good size, little bit run down depending on where you are, around 133,400 people so a large-ish town. Restaurants, supermarkets, clothing stores on the high street, all that stuff, and easy enough to get around for the most part (though, if you lack a car going to a larger supermarket is difficult). No night life to speak of. Very few students.

Historic-ish. Portions of the town date back to the medieval period, which is fairly apparent from the architecture. Some more dates from the 16th and 17th Century when it was under the control of the Hanseatic League. But most of the buildings are fairly typical and a bit brutal.

12 month season ticket by rail into London is just over Â£6,000, so pretty typical for the distance. Travel time is about 1hr 10 mins to 1hr 20 mins depending on the exact time, but it's an easy enough jaunt.

If you're interested take a look at it on Google Maps, try the WikiTravel page for it. Local newspaper is the [Ipswich Star](http://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/home) and if you want to look at prospective jobs for your partner then most of the Council run schools list jobs through [Suffolk Jobs Direct](https://www.suffolkjobsdirect.org/categories/teaching-primary/373.cat) not many at the moment, but the schools re-open next month anyway so they've been recruiting for a while. A lot of schools are academies now so they'll recruit through their own website, or through their controlling organisation's website.

null,null,swug3,,Tory voter coming for your benefits,null,"The next 5 years for Labour will the most crucial in its history. If it cannot take the advantage from the Conservatives, it will doom itself.

This will allow the Lib dems to rise again, which I welcome, as we need a strong opposition as it allows debates to be had.

This leadership campaign has basically written what the Conservatives are going to use in 5 years time. The reasons for this are pretty obvious:

1. Its dragged on for too long, its been 3 months. Which in political speak is a long time. In this time, Osborne has announced a budget, David Cameron has announced the EU referendum. Allowed the SNP to stick more knives into Labour over being split on the budget. And have gone on summer break without the country falling into collapse (which people were predicting after the election). By doing this, the Conservatives have taken the lead and the advantage, so much so, they just need to just watch and wait for Labour to try and catch up.

2. Corbyn believes, has done, said things in the past which will come back to haunt him, especially in the press. We know how he needs to win, but his views will not allow him to.

Heres a few examples which will stop a lot centrist and right wingers from supporting him:

1. Working with the SNP, which only just fuels the English to vote for a party that will offer them something..... The Conservatives fit the bill here.

http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/jeremy-corbyn-would-make-pact-with-snp-to-be-pm-1-3851857

2. He wants discussion on the Falklands..... Tories again win here, since the Argentinians don't really have an army anymore, and there was a referendum in the Falklands on what they want to do only a few years ago.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CagRMhkO-zE- Him saying discussion

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21750909- Falklands referendum

https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/argentine-military-capability-almost-all-gone/ - Military capability of Argentina.

3. Opening up a can of worms in Northern Ireland, by getting to close to Sinn Fein. This will only cause more violence within Northern Ireland, and will mean people will vote for either sinn fein or more likely DUP and UUP.

http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/steerpike/2015/07/jeremy-corbyn-reunites-with-his-old-comrade-gerry-adams-in-parliament/

4. Calling Hamas friends. He is calling terrorists who want to see the destruction of the jewish people friends is pretty telling. It may have been a slip of the tongue, but that and being close to Sinn Fein will allow the press to say ""he's besties with the terrorists"".

So, while I am predicting the future, I am very convinced that Corbyn is the worst choice for Labour. He is going to give the Tories a media coup, which will destroy his campaign.

Let's add that to your positive experiences and you realise quickly that the negative depictions of these people is new (Indian men are sexist gropey rapists, Asian Men are Gross).

By contrast a lot of Muslims are portrayed in the media in a much more negative light and their equivalents are often hidden (people assume they are Indian and are therefore Hindu). 

The big difference is not culture but a lack of education. Most Indians came in under the skilled workers rules. Doctors and Engineers. People who had educations. Most Pakistanis and Bangladeshis were forge workers. At that time you didn't need to speak English. Indians could, the Pakistanis and Bangladeshis didn't. 

Now you have the problem of white collar workers in a post industrial society. There were no more forges, but their kids learnt to run forges. So they had no jobs and none of the skills needed to survive. It's why all the large Muslim communities are old factory and forge towns. The white people had English and could do other jobs. The first Muslims didn't. They are basically on a generation gap playing catch up.

He was opposed even to wars that most people thought were justified, such as the rescue of the Kosovo people from Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄâs attempted genocide. This so incensed fellow left-winger Clare Short, then a Labour government minister, that she said he was a disgrace to the Labour Party and âlike those who appeased Hitler.â

For those who don't know, Kosovo was where we rescused the Kosovans from certain genocide by the Serbs. Corbyn was in favour of the genocide continuing.

Also I have serious concerns about Corbyn's views on Northern Ireland as a Labour voter and someone who knows how difficult peace has been to achieve.  Inviting Sinn Fein to Westminster was an act of defiance, not an act of peace.  If he wanted to influence Gerry Adams, he should have done what John Hume (the leader of Northern Ireland's other nationalist party) did and met with him in secret.  Corbyn also voted against the Anglo-Irish agreement in 1985, an important and significant step in getting the British and Irish governments to work together for peace and a lasting settlement in Northern Ireland.  

Corbyn is known to be pro a united Ireland. His actions make it legitimate to question whether he was more interested in that outcome than a peaceful settlement everyone in Northern Ireland could be satisfied with.

It was a game alight with the expectation of a single point, if that, but QPR turned the tables with a rare comeback victory away from home.

A few changes to the starting XI had Chery, Luongo, Phillips, Austin playing together as our main attacking options.  The engine sputtered initially but after halftime, this combination came alive.  Chery and Phillips are both capable of cutting inside and getting a shot and excel at crossing.  Luongo can play in behind Austin, is also capable of making a chance, and has a history of picking out a lethal pass.  Some may argue that Chery needs to be played in an attacking midfield capacity but he was used quite readily on the wings while at Groningen.  More importantly I think each of these players have something to prove.  Chery that he can do it in England, Luongo that he can do it at this level, and Phillips and Austin that they are PL calibre players.  I think it is of significant importance this group continue to play together.  If any injuries do crop up we have Mackie, JET, Polter and arguably even Hoilett and Blackwood who can sub into one of these positions.

Then you have almost a second team, consisting of the back four and the two defensive midfielders.  This engine is still misfiring as we are giving up far too many goals on a per game basis.  We have a lot of options though.  When Traore and Yun are fit we can look at slotting one of them into left back ahead of Konchesky who, while experienced, lacks the pace necessary in the Championship to get back and make overlapping runs.  Even Kpekawa is a contender, so competition will be strong for this position.  In the middle Onuoha is the obvious lock, with either Hill or Hall playing beside him and possibly even Perch if we can find another right back.  Right back is an area we could do with another addition, even if on a loan.  Don't forget about Furlong here either, these QPR products could really do a job for us this season and absolutely have something to prove.  In the midfield you can rotate between Faurlin, Henry, Doughty.  Gladwin is somewhat of a wildcard and excelled in a multitude of midfield positions at Swindon.

If we can sort out the back and keep the four up front firing I think we a set for an exciting and successful season.

That helps me decide how I feel about the Denayer move. If he's truly the prospect we all hope, then he's going to come back next season to take Demichelis' spot with a look toward helping spell an aging Kompany.

In theory, that should make it easy to cycle through Defenders; as one retires, the next 20 year old is promoted/brought in, he maybe has a loan spell or two, and after he's paid his dues, and is a little older, the oldest player retires or moves on and he gets more game time.

null,null,theflyingbarney,Pembrooke,Pembroke,null,"Aha, a Valencian! I haven't seen any others on the sub in an age (and I've just graduated), so I'll do my best to answer the Pembroke-specific questions.

1) - I don't remember there being specific offers there so I don't think you're going to lose out by having a bank account sorted as soon as possible - trying to sort it all out in freshers week as well as everything else that's going to be going on will be faff that you don't need.

2) - Gowns are college-specific, Pembroke's has weird tassels on the arms. You have a few options for where to get one from and that will dictate the price. Personally I got mine from Ryder and Amies, which is the shop on Kings' Parade that does a whole load of university clothing, and I remember it being roughly Â£45-50. If you want a nicer one, you can get one from Ede and Ravenscroft on the corner of Kings Parade and Silver Street, but that'll be more expensive (exactly how much so I have no idea). Finally, perhaps the best option as long as you get in there early is to go to the Porters' Lodge as they often have second-hand ones to sell - again, not sure on prices but IIRC they can vary between Â£20-40. 

3) - I never used it but the general consensus is that the Pembroke gym is a bit rubbish; on the other hand it's free for college members, and upgrading it is currently high on the JPC's list of priorities so something should be getting done in the next year. I don't think there was much in the way of weights so if you're after that, either Kelsey Kerridge or the University Sports Centre would be the first places I'd look at, though I have no idea how good either is.

4) - there might be exceptions for your subject-specific stuff, but certainly for basic college-based stuff linux *should* be fine, as long as you can put up with the IT department's staff not being quite so clued up on how to fix your problems. If you've got a spare Windows disc lying around that you can install, might be worth taking it with you in case of emergency, but you might not need it. 

5) The more commonly done thing is just to fry in the bottom of a saucepan, although people do hide frying pans. The important thing, especially when living in college, is to make sure you have all the windows open and as much airflow through the kitchen as you can, as the fire alarms are notoriously trigger-happy. 

6) - I tended to just keep that sort of thing in my room, most rooms in college will have a decent amount of storage space and my room in first year even had a pseudo-kitchen area with cupboards and a countertop (though no actual appliances or anything like that). There will also be cupboards in the gyp room but depending on your neighbours stuff might get nicked from there. 

7) - no idea re engineering specifically, but most subjects I've come across do that kind of thing between second and third year, if at all. Certainly wouldn't worry about it too much now unless you're told otherwise. 

8) - No idea, sorry

9) - That all sounds fine and dandy to me, as long as you've got all your relevant stuff you should be fine. Might be worth checking out the Pembroke Freshers' facebook page as the JPC will post stuff like the freshers' week timetable on there, and update you with information you might want (plus you can talk to all the other freshers-to-be!)",null,0,null,1440167650,null,null,false,0,cuaoj7c,null,t3_3hudqj,null,null,null,t3_3hudqj,null,null,null,1441384729,null,4,null,cambridge_uni,t5_2s17x,4,null

null,null,stent_removal,lfc87,,null,"I keep saying this, but: a lineup means very little without a ""system"" to back it up.

When we talk about ""4-3-3"" or ""4-2-3-1"" or ""3-5-2"" or ""4-4-2 diamond,"" we're really talking about systems. After all, a 4-2-3-1 is just a modified 4-3-3.

Your lineup can most probably be justified as a 4-4-2 diamond, where play goes through the middle with fullbacks roaming forward, with Firmino playing just off the shoulder as a second striker to Benteke. Which, yes, can work. We've shown in the 13/14 season that it can work with the appropriate personnel.

The question right now is whether or not this is the best system for the players we have at this moment in time, of which I'm not convinced.

Based on this system, how *quickly* would we be able to transition from defense to offense? Because at the end, you want to be able to make a rapid and efficient change from defense to offense, and vice versa.

I see no serious defensive issues in this line-up, but in attack, we seem to be stuck in two different mindsets. Moreno-Coutinho-Milner in the middle seems really unbalanced. Do we want Moreno and Milner to act as pseudo-wingers? Or do we want them to pass through the middle to Coutinho, where Firmino can make runs off Benteke?

The issue there is that Moreno-Coutinho-Milner ahead of Can puts an extra man in the middle, but if we are asking Milner and Moreno to act as wingers, we would be caught with our pants around our ankles in defense. Any team that plays a midfield 3 would be facing just Coutinho and Can in the midfield.

I like the combination of Coutinho-Firmino-Benteke in attack, and also think that having the extra man in midfield is a good idea in defense (So we would line up 4-4-1-1 in our defensive phase), but disagree with the inclusion of Moreno in a midfield role.

I haven't seen enough games yet to get a clear idea of what Rodgers is going for, but I think a 4-3-3 worked best for us, with Can in a holding role, Milner/Henderson ahead, and Coutinho/Benteke/Firmino   up front.

In transition to defense, we'd probably have a 4-1-4-1, with Can holding again, and Coutinho-Henderson-Milner-Firmino holding the line at midfield... though again, I need to watch more games to see what the roles Rodgers has in mind are. It seemed from that last two games that Milner took on a bulk of the pressing role. Which means we were in sort of a 4-4-1-1 with Milner ahead of the midfield 4.

But what the fuck do I know, I just watch soccer.

I would say it's Conservative voters who need to interest primarily, not just Green, UKIP and non-voters.  If 1/6 of Conservative's current voters move to Labour, then Labour will go from being behind by 6% to ahead by 6%.  

To be ahead by 6% without Conservative voters would require every single one of SNP and Green supporters to vote Labour, alongside a third of UKIP voters.  Obviously 2015 non-voters would also help, but I think it's very difficult to imagine a realistic scenario where Labour gets ahead of Conservatives without a decent number of voters moving from Conservative to Labour.

Surely it's more correct to say that the UK government is trying to privatise the English NHS (even though they don't call it that for some reason). There isn't actually a single UK-wide NHS.

NHS Wales is a completely separate organisation (as is the one in Scotland and NI) that is entirely controlled by the Welsh government, so none of the privatisation has effected it.

But because Welsh government spending is tied directly to UK government spending, the cuts that the UK government makes means less money goes to the our government, which means less money goes to our NHS, even though nothing has changed here.

In that case my answer for number 5 would be to reform the Barnett formula so Wales is no longer underfunded, and that money is tied less to what England spends, and allow the Welsh government to raise its own taxes rather then just relying on handouts every year from the central UK government.",null,0,null,1440168712,null,null,false,0,cuap6uu,null,t3_3hu7np,null,null,null,t3_3hu7np,null,null,null,1441385033,null,5,null,Wales,t5_2qhrl,5,null

What I mean is friends tend to be very snobbish and judgmental about places whether they be restaurants, pubs, etc.  This is about things like their food, service, etc;  it has to have had nothing less than 5 out of 5 reviews and anecdotes before trying it.  Worse they tend to only visit once, *even when it impressed them*! 
Then when it closes they lament its loss ... Um perhaps if you really miss it youâd have gone more than once in 3 years â¦. no place can survive if you give them Â£20 every year or two (small print: Again, these are places they LIKE!).

Basically it's sad that there's so little ""let's try new things"" attitude, as well as forgiving less than Michellin Star quality or service (within reason of course: Unless the waiter backhands you or thereâs an unforgivably terrible off-putting experience, itâs about having fun and chatting with friends.  Itâs an attitude my American friends readily possess and coming back here I was a little surprised seeing the slightly hypocritical stance you call out alongside with this aspect Iâm moaning about.   
Maybe itâs just this group of friends; they need to be more willing to go out more and forgive a less than amazeballs experience.  Life isn't about being treated like Little Lord Fontleroy and living with impeccable flawless service like a celebrity.  Just get out there and enjoy it.  Personally having travelled a lot thereâs been very rare the time Iâve been affronted by any place here.  Ironically the closest is probably Mavericks (for many reasons) but I still enjoy going from time to time and like it for what it is.

null,null,phys1cs,null,null,null,"If Scotland consumes (say) 45TWh per year of electricity and Scottish renewables generate 45TWh, it could be said that renewables have met 100% of Scotland's electricity needs, and this certainly seems feasible by 2020. That's absolutely not the same thing as every unit of electrical energy consumed in Scotland having been generated by renewables though. What it will mean is that Scotland will often generate much more than is needed, during which times the power will have to be exported to England or wasted, and there will also be times during which Scotland has to import power from England in order to meet demand. This is less of an issue at the moment because about 1/3 of Scotland's generation is nuclear (runs flat out most of the time) and there's enough coal and gas to meet most gaps in wind generation or peaks in demand. 

A couple of years ago, Scotland had Cockenzie (1200MW), Torness (1200MW), Hunterston (1000MW), Longannet (2400MW) and Peterhead (1200MW). Cockenzie closed in 2012, Longannet closes next year, Hunterston will probably close some time around the early 2020s, Torness maybe a few years after. Peterhead just about manages to make a profit by providing reserve capacity to the grid and might be able to carry on doing this once it's the only one left, but this is really not a good situation for grid reliability. A new 2000MW interconnector between Hunterston and Deeside will be built soon - the primary purpose is to export wind power, but this and other links will be increasingly important to *import* power from England and Wales once the big generators are gone and most power comes from variable wind. Planned new capacity in England and Wales include a mix of large, dispatchable generators as well as renewables (though obviously less than Scotland as a proportion of consumption, given the population density) so this won't be such an issue.

null,null,kde01,king,,null,"&gt; Its not ridiculous at all. There are a number of players, as mentioned above, that have signed for arguably lesser clubs that would have done a good job here at Spurs in positions where they are needed.
&gt;

You think they would have done a good job here. But you can never tell. Look at Lamela, Capoue, Soldado, Stambouli - all players that should have excelled with us but haven't. The only one still with us is Lamela, and for how long? 

Just because we think a player will be good for us doesn't guarantee they actually will be. And the players like Yarmo we've missed out on so far seem to be in positions we don't need to strengthen in. We needed a backup right back, a right center back, a cdm, attacking cover, and another striker. We've signed three other above and it looks like we'll get the last two in soon. I think that at the point we are currently we need to be very deliberate in what we buy. The Bale summer saw us buying players we didn't need and look how that ended up. 
 
&gt; Our defence WAS our biggest weakness. Its also still not our strong suit. Toby said our midfield is lightweight in comparison to Southampton, if that isn't a good enough sign that our own defenders think we need more steel there, then I don't know what is. Not to mention we have 1 striker, and when he gets sore because he has had almost no rest time over the past season and summer, and he has to go off, what options are there?

Agreed here. Clinton and Chadli can play backup striker and across the attack if needed. Eriksen and Lamela are also very versatile. Andros still exists. Dembele can play center or right.  We've got attacking options but we definitely could use someone like Berahino. 

I strongly agree with the CDM need, too, and think that should be priority before another striker is brought in (but that's just me it seems). I don't see how either position need necessitates Yarmolenko though.

Rotherham held on for dear life last season and have somehow maintained their spot in the face of an anaemic attack. This is a live-stakes game and I'd expect Onuoha and whichever of Hill or Hall partners him to be able to handle their journeyman striker Derbyshire (who had the unusual balls to go and play in Greece, to his credit) and the rest of their underwhelming attack. Of course the stage is set for Ledesma to go crazy with petrol and matches on his combined Rotherham debut and Loftus Road return. They look to have tried to secure their defense over the summer, presumably in a bid to stabilise in this division, but the firepower on display in our first three matches should be more than enough to overwhelm them. This is possibly a good match for Chery and Luongo to draw cards as I wouldn't be surprised to see them resort to physical bullying to try and neutralise QPR's midfield talent.

null,null,Cheeriols,null,null,null,"&gt;Okay. And the media portrayal of them. The fact most of them perform well at school? Let's add that to your positive experiences and you realise quickly that the negative depictions of these people is new (Indian men are sexist gropey rapists, Asian Men are Gross). At the most it means I can't get a date. 

The negative depictions are related to negative events they have acted out. And why can't you get a date? There's more than one or two decent chaps in the UK - I'd take you out on a date to see if you have the right accent.

&gt;By contrast a lot of Muslims are portrayed in the media in a much more negative light and their equivalents are often hidden (people assume they are Indian and are therefore Hindu).

Muslim criminals are so over represented that guidelines have been issued to media editors to stop using the word muslim. Something pushed for by the OIC, I believe. This is because muslims ARE committing crimes at a rate no other demographic can even keep up with.

&gt;The big difference is not culture but a lack of education. Most Indians came in under the skilled workers rules. Doctors and Engineers. People who had educations. Most Pakistanis and Bangladeshis were forge workers. At that time you didn't need to speak English. Indians could, the Pakistanis and Bangladeshis didn't. 

All have an education. From the moment we are born, we learn. Culture is a part of a persons education. Also, as I mentioned a good amount of ISIS recruits are educated to degree level. What kind of education are you referring to? Also, I would think by now they would have an excellent handle of English, no?

&gt;Now you have the problem of white collar workers in a post industrial society. There were no more forges, but their kids learnt to run forges. So they had no jobs and none of the skills needed to survive. It's why all the large Muslim communities are old factory and forge towns. The white people had English and could do other jobs. The first Muslims didn't. They are basically on a generation gap playing catch up. 

The same happened to the working class. Coal mines, Steel mills, pretty much all of our industries were all but erased. If you remember racism from the 80's, you surely remember the coal miner pickets. White people did not have other jobs to go to, they are still in the same boat as any industrial workers from abroad.

There isn't really any excuse for the way a lot of muslims behave.

Some were given a fair chance, others it feels were not, some were given all the patience in the world, and some were written off after only a handful of minutes of play. 

With regards to the areas we need to strengthen in, I still think the right wing is a place we need to look at. Dembele is only filling in, he isn't the best and we *can* do better, and we *should* do better for that position. Lamela has shown he is creative, but equally, he wanders inside so much you cannot keep him as a winger, leaving whomever is in rightback often overloaded. Lennon has no future with us. The fact we are willing to listen to offers for Townsend suggests he isn't really in the frame for a starting place any time soon. So then we've got, what, a pretty poor turnout on the right wing to be frank. 

We need a CDM. I am pleased we agree on that. Before a striker? I don't know. I think at the same time would be best, and as soon as possible. 

The joy of all this and the fact that Reddit provides the forum is that we don't agree, and probably won't. Its not like we're killing each other in arguments. Its just a forum to voice opinions and discuss things. Anyway, this says pretty much everything very well...

First interesting fact - 13 of Lamelas 15 goals from Roma came from inside the box, not cutting inside and belting it, all [seen here plotted out](https://youtu.be/Rj3sq7sDSqU?t=3m45s). Point 1 for playing AMC. 

I honestly believe his best position is AMC/Treq, off the Striker. I want him to play there desperately. It leaves the Eriksen issue, but Eriksen can play on the left miles better than I think Lamela is on the right. 

I posted a LONG thread before, citing his time at River, Roma, his games with us and some other 'evidence', complete with breaking down games with us where he'd surge infield and look totally comfortable there, while playing some cheeky killer passes. I may (or may not because it's a ball ache doing it), find some examples of this in action. 

There's been quite a few occasions I distinctly remember that when he cut inside to the middle he looked his best. 

[Ignore the music, but Lamela vs Villa 13/14 season] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exsCOYDMk7g). Watch the entire thing, and REALLY take close note of how devastating he was whenever he drifted central; he could have easily picked up a couple assists and a goal himself that game. (and IIRC, he was still having 'back issues' then). The opening chipped through ball, the next run through the centre shrugging off Sylla (i think, a BEAST dm for Villa like he's nothing) then playing a nice, delcate, cheeky ball unlocking the defence. This goes on and on. This is my evidence, in one game. 

I could find plenty other examples of times he's played a great through ball unlocking the defence. [This has some of the EXACT thing I'm talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEaAFxwyBqo), watch what he can do in the centre! [The 2 clips here, fantastic](https://youtu.be/eEaAFxwyBqo?t=3m44s). The ball to Chadli vs Arsenal...ahhh.

I'm sure we all could, where he's been let down by the finish by the stikers. He's so very underrated when it comes to pulling some magic out the bag with his creativity - hell, I think he could be as creative as Eriksen. A hard working AMC pressing the defense from the front, with the stability of 2 CM's behind him and it's much more preferred than leaving the entire flank open.  

I mean, as a youngin', he stole the show at AMC, in the biggest game in Argentina, River against Boca, opposite no other than arguably one of the great playmakers in Riquelme. He excelled.

Roma, I believe that he was planned as Totti's heir through the middle, but Totti is Totti and Lamela was capable on the right. 

tl;dr Lamela will thrive and fufill his potential at AMC, 100% certain. Just google ''Lamela central'', and you'll find lots of various opinions from coaches and armchair fans alike saying his best position is there.

Grad accommodation at Sidney varies. I believe a small number live within the college itself, but most likely you will live in a college owned house elsewhere, known as a 'hostel'. Some of these houses are extremely close to college - about 90 seconds walk away - though some will be further out, maybe a five or ten minute cycle.

It is worth noting that I'm pretty sure most colleges will have little to no in-college accommodation for grads (though I can't be 100% on that, not being a member of those colleges!), in fact some old colleges are so small almost no one (even undergrads) lives on the main site.

I don't think 'fluff' opinion pieces, which after perusing would easily be picked apart as purely personal opinion, can be useful as 'evidence' in whatever your counter-argument is.

&gt;Also I have serious concerns about Corbyn's views on Northern Ireland as a Labour voter 

Seriously, this just sounds like some commenter saying 'as a mother' on mumsnet, being a Labour voter gives neither of us any more licence on opinions than any one else.  I agree I have my concerns too though, but really we have to look to the future and push for better in the Labour party, to me the least of my concerns with Jeremy Corbyn are with Northern Ireland, and believe me I have many concerns, not only with Jeremy Corbyn but with Labour as a whole.  Like I said I'm not actually a fan of Corbyn or his politics, but this is how politics are done in a sense, he's being forced to rebut all these assassinations (legitimate or otherwise) on his politics and character, and still he seems to be the frontrunner of this election, perhaps there's something to be learned from this in the same way there's something we can learn from the way UKIP manages itself.

&gt;The author, Alex Massie, voted Labour in this year's election 

I find it rather a shoddy argument when people try and separate the author of a piece from the editorial stance of a paper or magazine when it suits their narrative.

It seems likely at the moment that Jeremy Corbyn will actually win this election, I might not like it, you might not like it and I understand that, but I'm going to accept it, the way I accepted the election defeat, the way I will have to accept privatisation of the NHS, how I'll accept a 12bn cut to welfare, how I'll accept poor students leaving university with Â£50k+ of debt whilst the richest in society continue to be coddled by a government that cuts their taxes, but I'll try and be positive about Labour and concentrate on the issues, because the alternative is to just burn the whole thing down, tear up my membership card like a petulant child, applaud those 'principled' MP's that didn't run in the election against Corbyn and decide to form their own party and make a 2020 election win an even more remote probability than it already is.",null,0,null,1440170725,null,null,false,0,cuaqi6n,null,t3_3hudm8,null,null,null,t1_cuaocbx,null,null,null,1441385693,null,3,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,3,null

&gt;Being on the far left of the Labour party does not make you ""far left"". That's *exactly* like calling Liz Kendall ""far right"" which should be obvious bollocks to anyone. 

? Kendall isn't on the far-left of the Labour party.  

OK, I get that the hard-left think that Corbyn is a moderate, but you have to admit - that view is likely not going to be shared by anyone else.  It only works in echo chambers like this one.


&gt;Everything else you say is either pitiful smear or ""lol socialism is nutty"". 

What a great argument. 


&gt;You should actually educate yourself about what moderate left politics are, and how that relates to Corbyn's proposals. He wants to work within the current capitalist system to bring about greater equality and social change - which is a moderate left position. If he proposed destroying the current system in favour of total equality, that would be far left. But he isn't.

'Educate yourself'.  Where have I heard that one before?  Ah yes, from every other ideologue on the internet.

Okay put it this way the stereotype for Hindus and Chinese is that we are all insanely well educated, smart and good at our jobs because we work hard. 

Even with that it is harder to get a job if you don't have a Westernised name. My brother is ""Andy"" (Short for Anand) and I am ""Amelio"" (Short for Amrit.)

Ben Kingsley? His real name is Krishna. Kal Pen? Kalpan. Mindy Kaling? Chokalingam. We all do it to avoid discrimination by name. 

AND this is ignoring the fact that many of the first generation of these workers didn't speak English. Or would be deported if they tried to join a union and many workers blamed them. While no one had any jobs it was EASIER to get a job as a white person than as an Asian at the time since you had fewer barriers to job and social mobility. 

Put it this way. I was born in 1985. My brother was born in 1994. When I was 12, I told my teachers I wanted to be a doctor. My teachers asked me why I would want to do that and work so hard. And that we shouldn't demand our kids to perform. 

If you said you wanted to be a doctor your family wouldn't be told that you should not follow your dreams. When my brother was 12 he got told the same thing. 

None of my ""White British"" friends got told that their dreams were stupid or hard.

&gt; This âwould therefore lead to the loss of the principal market for UK coal and the closure of the UKâs coal mines,â the paper says. âThe mine closures would also lead to substantial job losses â directly and indirectly within the supply chain â in areas of the UK with significant levels of unemployment and socio-economic deprivation.â

null,null,theBreadSultan,null,null,null,"ok I think you need to take a chill pill here mate,
Whats happened is the new people have ordered services on that phone line.
BT openreach (not the same as ~BT retail who you pay your bills to) does all the engineering work on the ""bt network"" so if you are with anyone other than virgin (or kingston communications) then it is a BT openreach engineer (or contractor) that does the actual work.
What has happened, is the new tennants have applied for services on the line. however Openreach has a lead time of 14 days...so in order to make sure everything is done properly, the line gets tagged, (in this case - impending migration to sky LLU or talk talk LLU whatever) - in order for this migration to take place, the line must be live. 
Because the tag was placed on the line BEFORE you tried to cancel it, BT will not be able to close the line, because it conflicts with the tag (this would be the same for every telecoms company that isn't virgin) 
In reality this is no drama at all...and you may find that it saves you money, because if the line is migrated away from BT by SKY then it's up to sky to pay openreach for the work, so bt won't need to charge you a disconnection fee, because you are not diconnecting the line.
Infact, due to standardised lead-times for all Openreach engineers, you will stop being billed for your line as soon as it moves to SKY, which will be sooner than your disconnection date.
It also stops the new tennants having to pay up to Â£120 to get the line re-connected (and wait for ages to get the line re-activated, and then have the BB put on it)

the new tennents have been sensible...and I'm afraid you are just getting yourself into a tizzy for no good reason.

We don't have the money of the current top 4 or Liverpool. I have no idea why it's so hard to see. I think most fans here (and the people posting the arguments linked here) are relatively new fans of football and have experience with mostly the Premier League.

The Premier League operates vastly different from any other league. The top 5 teams (Liverpool, United, City, Chelsea, Arsenal) operate differently from any other club in the world bar Real, Bayern, PSG, and Barca. They can pay whatever they need to on players and have the ability to pay ridiculous wages because their revenue streams are so far ahead of ours. 

I only started supporting Spurs five years ago but I've been following football for much, much longer (Greek Super League, Serie A for several years before turning my attention to England). Spurs' transfer policy is the norm across the world. Going out and spending whatever on players just to pay them GBP 100.000 p.w. isn't. Buying multiple players for 20-30 M that will just sit on your bench isn't. We need to stop thinking we're close to the top 5 clubs, we're not. And we can't spend like them. We may be one place below them in spending power but the rift between our 6th and their 5th is immense. 

Like the article says we'll have to agree to disagree and everyone is right in one way shape or form but the one thing that is a reality we're forced to agree upon is that we can't spend like the big clubs. And if we try - by throwing 20-40 M at every player this sub strokes itself over when we hear links to other top 5 clubs - we'll go the way of Pompey. 

Short term success isn't worth giving up long term success. Look at where we've come since ENIC took over. They've done a miraculous job. Missing a couple transfers and not rushing us into spending like a top 4 club aren't big deals. If we try to spend like a top 4 club without the income of a top 4 club we'll be fucked within a few years.

 You're definitely right, but I feel like (and i think the club feels like) Yarmo wasn't what we need since we're already doing pretty well on the right. 

I guess I'm more referencing the general feel in this sub - that we're not spending enough when we're spending right at our level. People expect 25-45 M wonder signings. Sven Bender was never a reality. Schneiderlin was never a reality. We can't just throw the money around needed to buy the best of the best when they're already at that level, hence the focus on youth. 

&gt; I have supported Spurs for over 23 years (that I actually remember properly). I've seen ups and downs. Sure we are reaching consistency under ENIC, but I spend a fortune on merch and going to the games to support a club I have loved forever. Is it wrong to want more and have aspirations? I don't want to be the happy 5th/6th. I want to finish higher. I want to compete. I don't expect us to. I don't demand us to finish 4th. But the point is that we can. Its not beyond us. It requires a bit of work. But to bring this all back around, there are clearly other priorities which is why I am disappointed

You're definitely in the right to have those aspirations but i think it's important to note that we are much better off than we were 10 years ago. And think - where will we be in another 5? New stadium that's the envy of the footballing world with a much higher income as a result. Look at how Arsenal is spending now that their new stadium is complete - if we can sit top 6 for the next few years until the stadium is done I think we'll see a whole new Spurs when our spending power increases.

How magnanimous of you.

&gt;I hear this a lot, but it often seems to stem from a disagreement about what an opposition is for.

I have an opinion, I'm sure you do too, but I imagine yours is far superior.  Like I said, I *think* he *might* be an effective opposition to the The Conservative party, I'm willing to watch and see because at the moment I'm seeing very little substantial opposition of any kind to the Tories, in fact I'd say that UKIP is likely providing more pressure around the EU referendum 'Exit' campaign than a party which is messing around with a lengthy internal leadership election.  That doesn't mean I'm entirely sold, just that he's outperformed his rivals so far, perhaps the other candidates should have stepped up their game, because they'll have to should they win this election against Corbyn and be set against Cameron and Osborne.  And let's not forget the reality after this election, when Parliament re-opens whoever the new leader is will be facing the Tory majority and they really don't have time to be lack-lustre.

&gt;What do you think the purpose of an opposition is,

Clearly it serves many purposes in a parliamentary system; scrutinising Government, debating legislation, holding the Government to account, voting for or against bills before the house etc. Obviously I don't expect everything the Government puts forward to be argued and voted against just for the sake of it, but clearly the Labour Party has a position and certain objections on moral grounds to some of the legislation being put forward by the Conservative government, and I would be more concerned if the Opposition simply agreed with most of it.


&gt;and where does its ability to put pressure on the Government come from?

Magic of course.  Joking aside, Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition simply comes from the fact that the Labour Party have the second most number of seats in the house and have an expectation to act as opposition to the governing party, how they go about forming that opposition is another matter.  A more suitable question isn't where it comes from, but what form will it take publicly and outreaching to the media.",null,0,null,1440172497,null,null,false,0,cuarox8,null,t3_3hudm8,null,null,null,t1_cuaouqw,null,null,null,1441386252,null,2,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

&gt;They sometimes seem to get in each other's way when both on the pitch.

Agreed. This is because I think naturally Lamela drifts inside. Not like a traditional inverted winger who will try 'beat a man, cut inside, blast it' type of player, even though he can do that as we've seen vs Burnley. It's just natural for him to drift centrally, and it might be the case he realizes himself his skillset means he's more effective there too. 

The issue is do we shift Eriksen to the left, who is more than capable, and keep Lamela central 'full time'? 

Just this raises the  issue of who takes the final 'spot? Chadli, on form, should be playing, but he is better on the left and he's right footed, so it might not work. Same for Njie, his left is weaker. Berahino is decent on his left, but scores mainly with his right. And hasn't Dembele looked decent out there too? He's got a good left foot on him, great ball retention, but not exactly rapid.

Great logic there mate. We saved millions of lives by killing millions of people in conflict and leaving the ENTIRE population in complete destitution, and then leaving letting ISIS sweep in to slaughter them all.

&gt; You also need to remember that the majority of the British public supported the war at the time which provided a mandate for that decision to be made. 

We supported the war after Blair's lies that led us to believe our own existence was at stake. That's what he should apologize for.

&gt; No one, at the time, could have predicted what was going to unfold in the years afterwards in the region. 

No one? We didn't have an exit plan. What did we think was going to happen? Even Jack Straw, Blair's own foreign secretary, urged him not to join, and that he was making the wrong move.

Stop pretending that we didn't do anything wrong. The Iraq war is a stain on our party's legacy, and it's people like you that uphold our international image of homicidal trigger-happy colonialists by defending Blair's lies. Because that's what there were, and that's all they ever will be, lies.
