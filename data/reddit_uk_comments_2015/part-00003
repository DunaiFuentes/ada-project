It's no good just saying that your rent covers 'bills' and 'utilities',
actually look at them, the stuff like phone, gas, water, electricity, tv liscence, internet. Council tax and home contents insurance, food. Find these papers, sort through them, and work out how much a third would be (so find/keep the receipts for food shopping). If you cost more council tax then compensate for it.

If you do this, you can actually know how much you cost and see whether you want to only pay that or even help your mum out a bit and pay extra. In my opinion, that would be better than throwing a lump sum at her every week, but it's not my decision!

One might argue that she should charge you for the internet and TV license too, but then those probably aren't *extra* costs, I guess it depends how she feels about it.

You can quite easily estimate food and water, the extra council tax should be a known figure. Figure out how long you're in the shower for and how often you use the loo etc, google the rough number of litres you're using, then find out what your bill is per litre. Done. Gas and electricity are probably not so straightforward but you can probably have a decent go. The maths is simple, but obviously nobody here can tell you how much food you eat or what electricity you use.

Figure it out, get as good a figure as you can. £55 seems *more or less* right to me if she's not interested in making money off you, but it's hard to say. Some people might say you should give her costs + £10 or so as a ""thank you for letting me live here"" thing but again, that's up to you and her. Good on you for not bleeding her dry though.

Here is [Chef John's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1DgmbMMOgA) video tutorial on youtube.

Personally I get a small cup of oil/shot glass of oil &amp; keep it to one side of my cooking station. Between pancakes, use a piece of folded up paper kitchen towel, dip it in the oil, then quickly wipe the inside of the pan. That's all the oil you need to keep the pancake from sticking. You can see Chef John uses butter on tongs, which looks nice for Youtube, but is much less useful for using over and over. Also, in his video, imo, he flipped it a little early. It'll be ready to flip when you can shake it free of the pan yourself (so it slides around the pan).

Don't forget you can use the same mix for [toad in the hole](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3330/5847654213_e6c14e8777.jpg) and it'll keep overnight for breakfast pancakes.

The **primary** aim of interest rate policy is inflation management. Recently they have taken a flexible approach to protect employment as Carney has said, this was mostly to ensure the Labour Market was protected as it went tits up in europe, but if inflation increases they will raise rates, regardless of if it hampers growth. Why do you think the BOE has been given such a wide range of extra powers recently such as those for the housing market, its to ensure that monetary policy is left for managing trend growth and inflation alone, but also allowing the Bank to deal with stability which it couldn't pre 2007.

&gt;Were you taught it at school?

Nope, and I went to a school in Ireland, the famine was never thought, it seems your info on what happens in Irish schools is faulty.

&gt;Let us note this fucking article was written by a fucking 'Irish'-American with romantic notions of rebellion and ignorance.

What does this article say about the famine? How is this article relevant to what we are actually discussing?

Further, in what way does the description of the event effect my original comment? My point was that if you make light of the famine you will cause offence, and that it doesn't matter if that annoys you, you are free to cause offence, just as people are free to be offended. As Carlyle said ""Ireland is like a half-starved rat that crosses the path of an elephant. What must the elephant do? Squelch it - by heavens - squelch it."" If you squish a rat, people get offended, being offended at people being offended is pretty pathetic.

""On 17 February, John Lyndon Sullivan wrote on Facebook: “I rather often wonder if we shot one “poofter” (GLBT whatevers), whether the next 99 would decide on balance, that they weren’t after-all? We might then conclude that it’s not a matter of genetics, but rather more of education ;)”""

"" UKIP DONOR SAYS GAY PEOPLE ARE INCAPABLE OF LOVE, BELIEVES WOMEN SHOULD BE BANNED FROM WEARING TROUSERS, AND HAS WARPED VIEWS ABOUT RAPE""

""A UKIP Parish Councillor claimed it was a “tragedy” that Section 28, which prevented the discussion of homosexuality in schools, was ever repealed, because gays want to “destroy the traditional family”.
Iain McLaughlan, a UKIP member of Orton Waterville Parish Council in Peterborough, made the comments on Facebook in February, while praising Vladimir Putin for banning adoption by foreign gay couples.""

""Dr Julia Gasper, who has since joined the English Democrats as a European candidate, previously wrote that gay people needed to stop “complaining about persecution” and start expressing “gratitude” to straight people, on whom they are reliant to be born.
She also said that PinkNews readers should be sectioned under the Mental Health Act, and used the UKIP forum to brand the gay rights movement a “lunatics charter”.
Since joining the English Democrats, Dr Gasper has been busy, calling for Grindr to be banned, and saying Daniel Radcliffe and a “queer mafia” were responsible for “victimising” former Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich into stepping down. She also recently claimed that world AIDS day “celebrates” those who “spread” HIV.""

""David Silvester, a UKIP councillor for Henley on Thames claimed that he warned David Cameron that allowing gay couples to marry would lead to flooding and that the Prime Minister ignored him.""

""A UK Independence Party councillor in West Yorkshire said he was “baffled” by Britain’s social acceptance of homosexuality and said that he found “female homosexuality” even stranger.
The councillor also discussed having an affair with an unnamed woman, and also about his difficulties in using appropriately sized condoms.
He later denied accusations of homophobia, saying he respected the “lifestyle choice” of gay people.""",null,0,null,1420309251,null,0,1420309916,0,cnd9zqc,null,t3_2r7ay8,null,t1_cnd9zqc,null,t1_cnd9ulq,null,null,null,1425081494,null,8,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,8,null

All this ""sea platform"" bullshit they told us (argie here) in school is false. Check what constitutes rights over your own sea platform and you will realize Falklands do not qualify. Edit: of course they are close, but they are not ""ours"" close.

IMHO Falklanders should choose. They could be part of Argentina but we are going with the wrong angle here. The land is theirs, we should be a little more aware of that and focus on a good relationship first and then make sovereignty offers that make logical sense. In the 50's the UK made offers of shared sovereignty for a period of time to transition into an only-argentine-sovereignty. But then almost that could go wrong, went wrong from our side.

When I first came across the original post I clicked /u/LCFCRYan username and found it was only 26 or 28 hours old so I originally thought it was someone trolling or eve worse - trying to scam me. Since I live only a few minutes away I decided to walk to Lime Street to see if there were any people there and sure enough there was. I walked up to them and asked if they were alright. At this point they didn't know I was the lad from reddit and I really just wanted to hear their accents to make sure they were from London.

After I seen them both standing outside Lime Street I thought to myself that nobody would have a kid stand in the freezing cold rain just for the sake of the price of a hotel room. I didn't bring any cash with me just in case I was about to get robbed so I told them that I was the guy from reddit and that I was going to go to the cash machine to get them some money so they could stay in a hotel until someone picks them up.

I ran up London road and went to the cash machine just next to tesco, withdrew the money and quickly got back to them. By that time it was really pouring with rain and hail. There was also a strong wind which made it worse. When I got to them I gave them the cash, the addresses of some hotels, numbers of all the private hire firms in Liverpool and my mobile number just in case they needed any more help. I was worried that they wouldn't find a hotel at this that time of night, especially one with vacancies so I also gave them a list of the 24 hour McDonalds where they could have waited until the following morning.

When I spoke to the older lad the next morning he had told me they had went around a few of the hotels near the waterfront and most rejected them stating they needed ID and other stuff to book a room. A manager at one hotel made an exception for them and booked them into a room for one night so well done to him.

I'm just happy they're home safe and well. They've invited me down to stay a weekend and watch a game sometime soon so I'm looking forward to that.",null,0,null,1420309876,null,0,false,2,cndaav0,null,t3_2r7l37,null,t1_cndaav0,null,t3_2r7l37,null,null,null,1425081350,null,288,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,288,null

Dershowitz is counter suing her lawyers for not checking his alibi before they went public with the accusations against him as he asserts he can easily disprove the allegations and they failed to follow due process.  

""""I'm planning to file disbarment charges against the two lawyers who signed this petition without even checking the manifests of airplanes or travel itineraries, et cetera,"" Dershowitz told Politico. ""I'm also challenging the young woman and the lawyers to level those charges against me outside of the courtroom, so that I can sue them for defamation. ... Finally, I’m challenging the woman to file criminal charges against me because the filing of false criminal charges is a crime.""

£500 per month + utilities = 2 bedroom charming place of my own (Oxford Road)

But for your point of Reus not being a RW, i really don't see what it matters where he starts on the field. Our usual play consists of Hazard, Willian, and oscar all interchanging position behind Costa. And I'm sure if Reus does join, I can see him being just as fluid and comfortable in any of the 3 position behind the striker as Hazard is. He isn't touted as one of the best wingers/second strikers in the world for no reason. But with that said, I'll be happy with any first team quality winger that poses more of a goal threat than willian and is comfortable in both left wing and right wing.

&gt;targeted members of the working class indiscriminately

They didn't specifically target the working class, nor were they indiscriminate in their targetting.

&gt;The PUP are loyalists, loyal to the 'British Empire', yet again another contradictory thing to do for a left wing group to do.

From a technical point of view, loyalists are loyal to the crown, not the empire. The two are entirely separate concepts and it's disingenuous to represent one as the other. The British left has a long tradition of support for the monarch, and if this is a criterion then the vast majority of the British left are, and have historically been, right-wing. 

&gt; the extreme right wing government of pre-GFA NI

Complete horseshit. You should be ashamed of something like that. Apartheid South Africa, Francoist Spain, Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, Faulkner's Northern Ireland. Spot the odd one out? 

Catholics in Northern Ireland were considerably better off than blacks in the southern US in the 60s, but I suppose Kennedy's government was extreme right wing? 

Anything else you can say about the UVF you can say equally about the PIRA. They killed a lot of working class people too - are Sinn Fein a right-wing party? Or can you just not overlook your bias?

They're also big supporters of women's rights - look at their former leader, Dawn Purvis, who directs the Marie Stopes clinic and has to deal with rabid religious nutjobs on a daily basis. (The most prominent of whom is a fanatic Catholic, but sure it's only those dastardly prods who're holding us back). 

As for the sickening xenophobic attacks, here's what one of the most prominent PUP members had to say on it just last month:

http://sluggerotoole.com/2014/12/05/immigration-and-the-inequality-agenda/

I should note that Dr Kyle is a GP in East Belfast, which has a large Polish population, and his surgery have an excellent reputation for working with the Polish community.

Some were necessary, some was acceptable, but you have to admit that there is a point when fairness is reached, and every concession after that point is just a concession. You can't expect anyone to just accept that.

&gt;I think to a degree the problem is unionists are stuck in the past on certain issues unable to see the Catholic side of the issue.

I don't think that problem is limited to just unionists.

Gifted deposits from parents are fine but they must be exactly that. You having to repay makes it not a genuine gift and lenders won't accept that as a deposit. Your parents will need to write a letter to the lender confirming they do not expect the gift to be repaid.

Whilst I would love to see a decrease in BTL which is locking first-time buyers out of the market, I think that a better solution is making ownership competitive with renting. BTL landlords are still performing a valuable service in taking on the liabilities and risks of home ownership. There is a problem with houses being marketed purely as buy-to-let. Perhaps there should be some incentive for developers to sell to owner-occupiers before they market to BTL landlords. A one-off tax discount, or failing that, an *obligation* to give landlords and occupiers equal consideration, equal marketing, and equal prices. 

I definitely don't agree with allowing tenants indefinite leave to remain. That would cripple landlords who are providing a service - and not everyone wants or needs to buy. The letting market allows people to enjoy the benefits of housing over the medium term, without the risks of ownership (negative equity).

Home ownership is still more desirable over the long-term with families looking for stability. It needs to be facilitated, without wrecking the letting market in the process.

Except the problem now seems to be there is so much of a drive for efficiency and budget that there are unnecessary bureaucratic procedures that waste the time of healthcare staff and patients alike.

I don't disagree that there are wastes in money, but the question is how do you best tackle that without putting such a burden onto staff that it has little actual benefit. Mistakes are usually made when you're in a rush, the exact same time when you cannot afford to spend valuable time double checking with a colleague everything you're doing or about to do. Imagine if a doctor had to have a nurse read back the name and date of the drug before injecting it, if it's truly life saving there is no time for that. Yet this is often when mistakes are made.

Shit happens, and especially in the medical world we need to strike a balance between a certain amount of paperwork and safeguards to protect patients and prevent unnecessary waste, but also not be unduly burden to staff that it just clogs up the entire system and not actually achieving anything.

Private companies are accountable to themselves only, and care about their money rather than the patients health. I have witnessed behaviour (as a medical student) in a private hospital that, had it taken place in an NHS hospital, would have had the surgeon written up because it posed an ethical as well as legal problem. I don't want to get into the details, but suffice it to say that private may be better at maximising your profit, but it comes at a certain cost. And many people, including myself, would rather have a little more waste but better care for the patient than the reverse.",null,0,null,1420315915,null,0,false,0,cnddbwy,null,t3_2r7s96,null,t1_cnddbwy,null,t1_cndce1t,null,null,null,1425078210,null,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13,null

null,false,EireOfTheNorth,null,null,null,"&gt; They didn't specifically target the working class, nor were they indiscriminate in their targetting

Sorry, working class catholics. Targetting people due to their religion or their sect: also an extreme right trait.

&gt; From a technical point of view, loyalists are loyal to the crown

Support for a monarchist system is also a right wing trait. You can be left wing while still passively supporting it, but to take up arms to 'defend' the right to have a monarchy is not a left wing thing.

&gt; Complete horseshit. You should be ashamed of something like that. Apartheid South Africa, Francoist Spain, Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, Faulkner's Northern Ireland. Spot the odd one out?

Just because they have varying degrees of severity doesn't mean it wasn't on the extreme right, pro empire, anti-republican (who, back then, had left wing and socialist ideals). We had a shoot to kill system in place at one time, you need to remember that - and you best believe it was indeed real. 

&gt; Catholics in Northern Ireland were considerably better off than blacks in the southern US in the 60s, but I suppose Kennedy's government was extreme right wing?

Just because Catholics were better off, doesn't mean they were anywhere near equal. So my point is still there. Kennedy, while he spouted all this liberal bullshit, was still right wing - don't forget he invaded Cuba (Bay of Pigs) because they were Communist - don't forget he played his part in bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war because Cuba brought in tactical, deterrent nukes to stop further invasion. Doesn't sound like much of a lefty.

&gt; Anything else you can say about the UVF you can say equally about the PIRA. They killed a lot of working class people too - are Sinn Fein a right-wing party? Or can you just not overlook your bias?

Yes, indeed they did - and it's a shame they did too, that is indefensible. But no, they aren't right wing - SF, at least they say so, are working toward what was proclaimed in 1916 - a socialist republic. A lot of their targets in the troubles were economical, symbolic, and/or tactical as well (which cannot be said for the UVF), but yes I agree and condemn any and all civilian casualties that died.

&gt; They're also big supporters of women's rights - look at their former leader, Dawn Purvis, who directs the Marie Stopes clinic and has to deal with rabid religious nutjobs on a daily basis. (The most prominent of whom is a fanatic Catholic, but sure it's only those dastardly prods who're holding us back).

Good. It's good they support women, and I welcome the Marie Stopes clinic. But don't for a second think my bias toward SF is due to religious tendencies there as the last part of your comment seems to suggest. I'm an atheist, and I'm a socialist - before I would support SF, I would support PBP. I don't see being part of the union (which is leaning further and further right these days, with a joke of a Labour party) is furthering my political ideologies.

&gt; As for the sickening xenophobic attacks, here's what one of the most prominent PUP members had to say on it just last month

Good for Dr Kyle and Mrs Purvis, they sound like good people - but for being such lefties, and for Dr Kyle to be led by a man who to this day says he doesn't regret shooting dead two civilian catholics 'because it helped save the union', while Kyle shouts down racism etc...

Similarly, Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen, while it does have it's own scanner, it is unable to meet demand, and again, Alliance medical provide a lorry mounted scanner to provide additional capacity and access for the Broadgreen site.

I don't know about the circumstances of UHNS, so can't comment.

There's more to providing a PET/CT service than just providing the scanners. A huge cost is the preparing the drugs needed for the scans, the main ingredient of which is fluorine-18, which only has a usable life of a couple of hours. This means you need a pharmacy equipped for the manufacture of radioactive drugs with on-site access to a cyclotron particle accelerator.

&gt; 'll also add that I'm afraid of paying proper rent, the kind that I would pay if I rented a place because I don't want to take on the 'provider' role of the family as I think it's a really unhealthy family dynamic to take on in a single parent family (I'm 22M).

What a fucking cop out. 

&gt; Lately, my mum keeps having a go at me about how the money I'm giving is only a ""token"" amount and that she resents the fact that I'm bringing her down financially. I think £55 is a reasonable amount, what are your thoughts?

You're taking the piss. 

Given that any income based benefits your mum is getting are lowered by you living there **BECAUSE THE BENEFITS AGENCIES ASSUME YOU'LL BE PAYING A FAIR SHARE** thus meaning you're actually costing her more money than just your share of gas and electric, given your wage you should be paying at least 1/3 of the total of all household bills however that is assuming you're still a cunt. **THE ENTIRE COUNCIL TAX BILL IS ALL ON YOU** because as someone unemployed she would otherwise get all of her council tax paid by council tax benefit if you weren't living there or were unemployed. 

You know your mum is in difficulty and the only thing you have to spend your £200 a week take home pay on after giving her a paltry token payment is getting pissed and jizz mags. I think its absolutely fucking disgusting that you know she's struggling like hell and you're such a selfish bastard you can't put your hand in your pocket to help out. Do you not consider yourself part of the family? What are you going to do when you leave home, meet a girl, live together and she can't work - let her starve whilst you have more than enough money for both of you?

If you were my son and that was your attitude you'd be out the fucking door and then you can get to pay out most of your wages to keep a roof above your head and see just exactly how much it costs to live. Certainly if she kicked you out she'd be a whole lot better off due to no longer being penalised by the DWP and council tax benefit.

1. They are tired of being called a retirement league. As an American I can tell you that this does not bother me, as I do not watch MLS regularly, but I can understand them. The Northwest coast fans like Seattle, Portland, and San Jose, are amazing, and about as hardcore as they come. They realize where the league is at, and want it to move to the next level. The feeling that always bringing in older talent, as opposed to investing that same money into an academy system, which was mentioned several times, is one of the big things holding MLS back. Most realistic people know that the lack of academy system is one of many problems. The drafting system, and more importantly the amount you can pay the average player are by far the two biggest things holding back teams though.

2. The people from LA specifically are saying it is a bad move because of their market. LA fans are a different breed. A rockstar like David Beckham playing at 1/4 capacity will probably pull more fans than a Gerrard in his prime would. It is a city of championship sports, and legendary players already. Kareem Abdul Jabar, Magic Johnson, Wayne Gretzky, Wilt Chamberlain, Nolan Ryan the list goes on and on. MLS has to compete with every other championship fanbase already in the LA market. In the last 10 years the town has celebrated championships in almost every sport. The Lakers, Kings, Ducks, Angels, even the USC trojans have a chance at a title contention every year. I know that Gerrard is going to be amazing on the pitch, but he is not going to draw as many fans, because he is not a household name in the states. He will draw fans and kits from LFC supporters though that were not currently watching MLS, and will sell tickets for that demographic.


So I do not mind the arguments, because I understand where they are coming from. MLS knows they are getting quality players, but they are frustrated that they can not attract them in their prime. They would rather have the money spent propping up a long term solution for creating better homegrown players.

LA is a great sports town, and although it is also great in the MLS, if not the best, it will always be the 4th or 5th most popular sport in that market behind college teams in the area.

That being said I can not be ultimately unhappy with this as a Southern Californian because I want to see him play live in person. If I can't watch him play in a red shirt on the tube, then at least I get to see captain fantastic in person. He will love the weather, the nice parts of LA are absolutely fantastic, and he may get to make his mark in a town that is legendary in America for sports in general.",null,0,null,1420317150,null,0,false,0,cnddybs,null,t3_2r87wv,null,t1_cnddybs,null,t3_2r87wv,null,null,null,1425077920,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Let's at least get the facts straight:

&gt; 1764: France arrives to the islands

&gt; 1766: Britain arrives to the islands

A somewhat misleading representation of the discovery of the islands (for a start, we established control in 1765, not 1766). 
Some Frenchmen set up a colony there, but British sailors arrived and claimed the islands for Britain so, by all accounts, the islands were either British or French before any thing else. Even if they really were French first, how does this mean they are Argentinian? I don't see you saying anywhere that the islands should be under French control (but this is probably because you seem to have some kind of phobia of 1st world countries, since you said in another comment you don't want a European country (even though 97% of [Argentinines are of European descent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentines_of_European_descent)) in control as they can use is an a 'forward base' or something). 

&gt; 1774: Britain leaves the islands voluntarily because of economic reasons of the time (I think it was related to the american independance ^[sic], but I'm not sure)

No. We never left the islands voluntarily. [The Spanish invaded and captured the Islands by force.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Port_Egmont) Also, this was in 1770, not 1774.

&gt; 1832: A mutin happens [...]

It's worth noting that the[ retaking of the islands in 1833](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reassertion_of_British_sovereignty_over_the_Falkland_Islands_\(1833\)) (not 1832) means that the islands have under British control longer than Argentina has been a country under it's current [constitution.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Argentina)

This whole argument of yours that whoever was there first has the right to control the islands is ridiculous in my opinion (and that of the UN). This is 2015 and we believe in democracy, so whatever the islanders want is the most important thing. *They want to be part of the UK, so they are.* If they didn't then they would most likely be abdicated, just as Ireland (and many others) was. Furthermore, the points about abandoning colonialism fall completely flat, seeing as how you want the islands to be under Argentinian control as opposed to them becoming an independent state. Argentina won't get one kilometre of the islands as long as the citizens want to remain British, yet Kirchner remains firm that the Falklands belong to 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I also saw your post in /r/Argentina regarding the issue. I found the replies incredibly interesting, as most people seemed to regard the issue of little importance (as far as I could tell using Google Translate, anyway), which I would agree with. I thought Argentines would be more assertive of the government's stance on issue since there is a lot of [propaganda](http://en.mercopress.com/2014/11/22/uk-reacts-to-malvinas-are-argentine-signs-on-public-transportation) regarding the issue.
It seems to many non-Argentines that the military junta in control of Argentina in 1982 only invaded to take the attention of the populace away from the other issues in the country as the time, believing the UK would not fight back and the islands could be annexed and this would gain support for the junta. In the end this ended up backfiring as Thatcher gained support and we had to put up with her for another term.

But anyway, I'm more interested in what other Argentines think of the issue: 

* In your experience, do most people in Argentina believe they have a right to the islands? 
* Is there more support for Argentinian claim to the islands among younger or older generations?

How is there no detriment to them if the quality goes down? They still have supervisors and bosses, and standards that need to be met.

It sounds like your mother doesn't mind you living with her but she can't afford to keep you. 

What you need to do is take everything you use in the house and divide it by three. Then pay her a third. You don't have to include room rent but you should be paying a third of everything. 

That includes everything you use. TV licence, food, gas, water, electricity, contents insurance, any TV or media subscriptions, Internet, council tax, cleaning supplies etc. 

Are you working full time? What's your plan? Are you saving to move out? Are you saving for further study? You need an end goal. 

I personally think 22 is far too old to be working full time and living at home unless you have a legitimate exit strategy.

At the bottom of that page it says that £33.1m was added on to cover cost of taking Card payments, VAT changes etc. so ""they"" are in the habit of adding on more costs.

I imagine there are some other running costs that were added on originally, paying the toll collectors, maintenance of the bridge etc. but it does seem unlikely that it explains the rest of the cost. 

Obviously there is also an element of profit for the companies, not sure what that is.

There was also an issue with VAT not being paid on the tolls when it was first opened. Maybe the way around that was to make us pay the tolls longer.

If the effect of forcing landlords to fix damp problems, or broken windows is them putting up prices then so be it, there will all of a sudden be a shortage in demand for low rent properties and a surplus of mid rent properties. The market will adjust. 

The losers will be those landlords who currently rent out shitholes. 

House prices and rent prices in the UK are primarily based on supply and demand, things would settle down in favour of renters. 

The only problem are would be where the only economical way to rent a property would be with big patches of black mould on the walls and the wind whistling through the windows.

So for instance, say you bought 50% share of a flat when it was worth £100k. Now it's worth £200k on the open market, so in theory that's a £100k profit. In practice:
a) the housing association will say it's actually only worth £175k
b) the people on the housing association's list may only be able to afford £150k
So if you do sell it, you end up with £75k, which is still a profit, but not the huge profit you may be thinking of.

What point? It's just standard landlord defending their parasitic business boilerplate.

As a start i wouldn't say its deluded as this is what the scheme is for helping people to start.

Not harder to sell especially in London

Higher LTV is better in my opinion

1 or 2 bed is whatever suits your needs.

**One thing i will say is something is DEFINITELY MISSING from the website in my opinion**

^^^ reason i say this is i think the rent stated on that website may be ground rent! There's surely no way on a value of £225k are they gonna charge you 200 a month rent.

b) give her a community sentence.

It means that property rental prices are too high - more houses are needed in the BTL sector as competition brings prices down.

It means that it's more attractive for house builders to build properties, firstly because they're being sold and secondly because they're getting a good price.

If all of a sudden BTL landlords stopped buying properties then think about what would happen to the housing supply? Less houses would be built, prices would go up.

The two issues are a shortage of housing, in general. And a shortage of council owned housing.

In other words -


If you only have GCSEs, then those are going to be looked at when looking for employment. Bad GCSEs = poor prospects in employment. You may not get into A levels either, as far as I know, you must have B at a subject for that subject to be an A level option. So, redoing GCSEs might be a good idea.


If you have adequate GCSE results to take A levels and you finish A levels, then not many are going to look at your GCSEs, only A levels, since that's the highest educational qualification that you have.


Note, if you are applying to top universities and/or have career prospects in e.g. medicine, I've been told that you are pretty much not going to be considered if you have redone your A levels to get A's.

Take UKIP as an example. Aside from the EU and immigration issues, one of their core tenets was stronger local representation. Most major issues were settle down by internal referenda including a one three years ago where the majority voted not to join a political coalition in EU to take their money. Look at now. Now that they have a chance of some power, they have decided to do it anyway and have dumped any attempt at local representation.

McDonalds aren't essential to society, housing is. There is no shortage of McDonalds restaurants, there is a shortage of housing. The more people looking to be McDonalds franchisees has no effect on those who don't. BTLers affect those who want to buy a house given the current shortage.

Do you see the difference?

I suspect if you asked a lot of renters, they'd prefer to buy. You might not, but as you say yourself, your needs aren't more important than anyone else's.

The fact that there is massive demand for people looking to own and occupy goes against your idea that no one wants to buy and everyone actually wants to rent.

null,false,Captain_English,null,null,null,"&gt;  the wasteful and sloppy nature of public sector work, where individuals working on public money feel no drive to make efficiency measures or to increase service quality as there is no detriment to them if quality goes down.

**This is such a fucking falsehood.** These people have careers, which weirdly enough depend on meeting objectives in line with management direction, even before the consideration that more than a few of them actually care about their work. 

It is constant in the NHS and other public bodies that staff are forced to do more, meet targets, and check boxes in the drive for greater productivity. This attitude that all public sector workers are lazy or worse still deliberately wasteful is propagated continually on an oversimplified and ignorant argument designed to cater to those who begrudge paying taxes and are envious of the public sector as a benchmark for good employment standards. It seems especially prominent in those who have never worked in both the Public and Private sector and have realised it's just as bad on both sides of the fence, although usually for different reasons. Cuts are happening across government but service provision is legally required to remain constant. No efficiency pressures? No drive on staff to be more productive when they're a wave of cuts from unemployment? Pull the other one. 

The inefficiency does not come from the people, it comes from not trusting the people and continually adding layers of paperwork forcing them to 'prove' everything they do for 'transparency'. This does not make one jot of difference to things like West Staffs, it just ends up 'on file' until the investigation comes in anyway, but it does take more and more effort away from actual patient care and disillusion staff from their jobs.

Think on the string of private sector support to public contracts, like train fare rises, SERCO's police tagging, ATOS or G4S's multi-billion pound fiasco at the olympics, and tell me with a straight face that these companies aren't fully aware that they can be just as inefficient as the public sector supposedly is, as they have no real competition or penalty clauses, and ultimately result not only in worse services as they provide the absolute minimum required but in some cases *do not even provide the service they were hired for!*

I do not disagree that there is waste in the NHS. I simply disagree that it is as extensive as so often presumed; that it is caused inherently by public sector organisations, rather than *meddling with* public sector organisations; and that it is unique to the public sector. I would also rather pay that 'waste fee' for the service things like the Police or NHS provide than pay the profit margin of an unaccountable contractor who offers the absolute minimum they can legally get away with (and are incentivised to do so!) and who STILL have systematic bureaucratic waste from their own reporting and targets as well as government mandated processes! As stands, there'd need to be at least a 12-15% waste fee in the NHS which would NOT be inherent to a contractor providing the same service just to break even with the profit margin of the private provider. 

Finally, contrary to popular belief, the private sector is not some harmonious problem solver with a 100% efficient work force, slick practices, and the best information storage and exchange mechanisms available. How many people on here do you see browsing and posting from work? Who else here is sick to the back teeth with their work's IT service, whose client information is built around an ageing access database from 2005 that no one understands any more? Who else has had to fight tooth and nail to get appropriate training provided? Or gone without?

null,false,Quagers,null,null,null,"&gt;The fact that there is massive demand for people looking to own and occupy goes against your idea that no one wants to buy and everyone actually wants to rent.

I never said there wasn't people looking to buy, I just said there was a massive shortage of rental properties as well. And B2L landlords contribute to reducing that shortage, given that your premise is that they are complete scum bags who serve absolutely no purpose I am just trying to point out that that simply isn't the case.

No matter how cheap houses get the country needs rental properties. B2L landlords use their capital to make properties available to this market, taking on the risk that there won't be the demand and receiving a profit in return.

If there is more demand in the rental market, rents rise, B2L becomes more profitable and so ownership properties get converted to meet this demand. Ditto if there is more demand for ownership then sale prices rise and it becomes more profitable to sell up, moving the stock the other way. Therefore B2L landlords serve an absolutely crucial purpose in balancing demand between the 2 markets.

The problem is that at the moment demand is shooting up in both markets, causing massive price rises for both. This is due to a bunch of reasons, planning laws, the popularity of london etc. etc. None of these are B2L landlords fault, they are the governments faults. They are simply profiting from the situation, which is perfectly within their rights to do and if you could I bet you would.

&gt; There is nothing parasitic about being a landlord. Rental property needs to exist, and a private landlord is much more efficient in providing it that the government. 

Why's that? Is it more efficient because you happen to be one? 

&gt; : Many people have absolutely no interest in buying property for a huge number of reasons, and many others will never have any prospect of owning their own home, regardless of how much you artificially limit the rental market to moderate gain for the lower-middle class.

Agreed, but the current situation is such where there is no happy medium. Lots of people are forced to rent because they cannot buy, even if they have good jobs and savings and could buy a house tomorrow if prices were saner. They want to buy, but they can't.

There'd be no problem if there was loads of houses and landlords and owner-occupiers could buy what they want. But there isn't, and so BTL deserves the ire for making the problem worse.

&gt; The fundamental problem remains that not enough houses are built. 

I'd agree, but you seem incapable of including your own group. I've said repeatedly that landlords are part of the problem, but not all of it. You can't deny that you are helping cause a shortage.

I'd recommend reading some Polanyi who has not just theories but empirical evidence. He explains how the 'market society' developed around the same time as the modern nation state at the end of the pre-modern era. He writes:

&gt;While history and ethnography know of various kinds of economies, most of them comprising the institutions of markets, they know of no economy prior to our own, even approximately controlled and regulated by markets. . . . The role played by markets in the internal economy of the various countries . . . was insignificant up to recent times. 

&gt;Mankind became 10x more economically free when we picked one or two commodities to represent prices

That's just a normative assertion with nothing to back it up.

&gt;and started exchanging our hides, flints, mushrooms, wheat wool and veggies in bazaars.

If you're referring to a barter economy then I hate to break it to you, but they virtually never existed.

&gt;Tell me how that is related to capitalism, if we agree that capitalism is owning oneself and one's affect and not trampling on that ownership through theft and taxation.

Except the problem is that we don't agree that that is what capitalism is. Literally nobody in the world who isn't an an-cap would agree that that defines capitalism. In fact, if that were capitalism then socialism would also be capitalism. I'll give you the wikipedia definition because it's nice and concise:

&gt;Capitalism is an economic system in which trade, industry, and the means of production are largely or entirely privately owned and operated for profit.

Obviously there's a lot more but that's the basis, and it's a definition that virtually all economists agree upon. Now, the thing with this is that it obviously *has* existed in the world and it obviously *does* exist. Perhaps you think that free market capitalism is better than ""crony capitalism"" (whatever that even means) but the fact is that capitalism **does exist.**

Moreover, the critique of capitalism I set out above is based on its theoretical conception - not actually existing capitalism. However it manifests itself, quite frankly I don't care because capitalism is terrible whether the state exists or not.

&gt;

&gt;__Arnold Judas Rimmer__ is a [fictional character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_character) in the [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) [situation comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_comedy) *[Red Dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dwarf)*, played by [Chris Barrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Barrie). He is unpopular with his crew mates, and is often the target of insults or pranks. After he is killed by a radiation leak in the series' first episode ""[The End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_(Red_Dwarf\))"", he is present only as a computer-generated [hologram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography), indicated by the ""H"" symbol on his forehead.

&gt;The [creators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Naylor) of the series acknowledge that Rimmer's [surname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_name) comes from a snobby [prefect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefect) with whom they attended school. They claim, however, that only the boy's name was used, and not his personality because that would imply he had one. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

I said that they are in it for themselves and for profit, not because they're providing some wonderful service.

&gt; B2L landlords use their capital to make properties available to this market, taking on the risk that there won't be the demand and receiving a profit in return.

And in the current market, they guarantee that demand through reducing the supply of houses for those who can and want to buy.

&gt; If there is more demand in the rental market, rents rise, B2L becomes more profitable and so ownership properties get converted to meet this demand. Ditto if there is more demand for ownership then sale prices rise and it becomes more profitable to sell up, moving the stock the other way. Therefore B2L landlords serve an absolutely crucial purpose in balancing demand between the 2 markets.

The problem here is that landlords effectively have it both ways. They set rents that prevent people from saving a deposit, because they've helped create a shortage on the other side through BTL which increases rental demand and therefore the rents they can get away with (especially in London). Since people can't save, they have no chance of buying, which means continuing to rent. Seems rather cyclical.

I don't buy the balancing argument. If a BTL landlord didn't buy the place, it'd get bought pretty quickly by an owner-occupier, such is the current demand for housing.

BTL would be fine if there was enough housing for people to buy and for landlords to buy to rent. There isn't.

&gt;  None of these are B2L landlords fault, they are the governments faults. They are simply profiting from the situation, which is perfectly within their rights to do and if you could I bet you would. Sometimes that doesn't make them popular.

The choosing to profit from the situation is exactly why it is partly their fault - it's not as if they were forced to buy a house to rent out.",null,0,null,1420322217,null,0,false,0,cndgi39,null,t3_2r7vgl,null,t1_cndgi39,null,t1_cndg53t,null,null,null,1425076731,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

It is totally irresponsible for a landlord to rent out a property that for all they know could be repossessed by the bank in 6 months time. I have nothing against someone buying a house as an investment and letting it out. They shouldn't be allowed to buy 6 properties on 100% mortgages, and then leave 6 families in the shit when it all goes wrong.

If tenants had proper rights, including long term security of tenure, then the landlord would need to prove he wouldn't have to fold if the mortgage rate went up by x%. That would get rid of a lot of casual BTLer who are just taking a punt. It wouldn't preclude people who could actually afford a second house (or had spare income to cover the mortgage).

I bought mine from On Your Bike - I found that the sales team were great but the servicing / aftercare pretty rubbish. I wouldn't recommend going here. 

I've used Cycle Surgery for servicing and have bought shoes and other bits from them - nothing but helpful staff and great service all round. 

Bike shop in Kings Heath seems ok although only popped in briefly to buy panniers with the Mrs. Can't speak for the quality of the bikes or their servicing but they're close to Moseley so might be worth a look. 

Things to consider when you buy - budget &amp;amp; what you want to use the bike for. If you're using the bike for commute purposes and the odd bit of tow path riding and little else have a look at cyclo cross bikes.  They're strong, have wider tyres than road bikes so are more comfy and they'll take a rack and panniers. They're also pretty quick. Best value for money are probably the Boardman CX range of bikes but they're only available at Halfords which may not be on the cycle scheme list. Having said the Boardman bikes are good, Halfords generally are not - worth avoiding. 

Mountain bikes - they're comfy to ride but the big nobbly tyres are slow. Avoid full suspension bikes under £1000 - parts will be cheaper and heavier than on a bike of a similar price with front suspension only. 

Best advice is to try before you buy!

If you have more questions feel free to ask - happy to try and answer them.

Despite what other teams in the past have done, it's primarily true that you can't win the league with kids, and even then, Chelsea are expected to compete on all four fronts and always reach the final rounds of cup competitions.

I'd love to see some youth get minutes, personally I'm disappointed that Baker has seen virtually fuck all in the way of game time this season, when he could have been developing out on loan.

There are upsides and downsides to both systems:

**+** Loaning means players are more likely to get minutes and develop

**+** Loanees get to try out a lot of different systems and can benefit from multiple coaches e.g. Bamford (similarly they could also benefit from one coach for a long time e.g. Courtois) 

**-** Loaning usually is to a lower level/standard than the parent club, and this questions whether they can make the step up (they usually aren't given the chance to prove)

**-** Loanees aren't guaranteed minutes as seen with Chalobah and Kalas. Players sold like De Bruyne and Matic will get minutes because the clubs get to keep them, there is little point developing players who will just leave.

_____________________________________________

**Sidenote on the topic of KdB**: He doesn't suit the EPL whatsoever. He's ineffective in the 2 of a 4-2-3-1, and can't track back which is necessary for no. 10s to do. The league is also too physical for him. He's a great player and I have no doubt he'll succeed, but it'd be a mistake to bring him to the EPL for any club.

_____________________________________________
If we want youth to be successful we have to give them the chance, but we can't expect immediate and consistent success and that's what Jose wants, especially during the early stages of his second spell at the club (it is infuriating not to see youngsters given the chance at league cup games, I'd rather they develop there for the future, than win the trophy). Give Mourinho another season to compete and we'll start to see youngsters brought through perhaps?

**TLDR**;

- Integration works, but it comes at a cost and takes time.

- Loaning can work wonders, but there's no guarantees which makes it risky.

- Don't expect Chelsea to switch from loaning, it's profitable and we get the odd gem here and there.",null,0,null,1420322682,null,0,false,0,cndgqpq,null,t3_2r8ihr,null,t1_cndgqpq,null,t3_2r8ihr,null,null,null,1425076619,null,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3,null

Having being through the entire BlueMoon thread it is surprising that most seem to be so casual and alright with the aspect that NYCFC fans were LIED too. The attitude that NYCFC is a ""daughter"" club and should be grateful and should know its place. Comments along the lines that how about Sinclair should be loaned to ""shut them up"" or bid for Gerrard to replace Lampard. 

CFC bid for NYCFC and if not them someone else would have won the bid and owned NYCFC so for them to be thankful to CFC for their existence is a bit over the top. Although NYCFC fans might have blown the lid in their moaning but they have a very fair point which apparently most here seem to turn a blind eye too because it is uncomfortable to accept a club of this magnitude has basically LIED. It is entirely disrespectful and extremely selfish. Apparently winning is all that matters and if a moral compass is askewed en route then who cares? Is that the message you impart to your kids as well?

NYC marketed ( and when I say marketed I am being underwhelming ) on the back of Villa and Lampard. They stated that they signed Lampard. It is not about being ""promised"" Lampard but oh snap the transfer fell through. This is a club statement saying the player has signed for them. MCFC posted that they ""loaned"" Lampard. ( That post has henceforth been deleted, but can be found using WebArchive/Reddit ) . Now suddenly everyone learns NYCFC actually never signed Lampard. It would be interesting when you are put through the same spot of being disrespected by being lied to throughout. An understanding between NYCFC and MCFC is meaningless because they are the same entity. You can't decline an offer to yourself. This entire event sets a very bad precedent and shows a complete disregard for NYCFC and fans. There are a bunch of clubs over variety of sports from people to pledge their loyalty to and actions like these just make it harder. 

Sure, Lampard would prefer to play in Prem League and have a shot at titles but that doesn't mean he feigns ignorance. He is holding a bloody NYC banner and has his mug plastered all over USA. 

So here are the questions the fans and I would like to know and if you can shed light on it,

According to posters and latest reports he never did sign for NYCFC and hence If he did not sign for NYCFC :
1. Why is he being marketed as one and he himself seems to do so. In fact here is him being still listed on the roster for NYCFC ( http://www.nycfc.com/players/frank-lampard ) ?
2. Why then did he ludicrously claim that he is headed to NYC ?

If he did sign for NYCFC :
1. Why isn't he with the club for the start of the season ? NYCFC website claims that his loan has been extended and that the date of return is being worked out. ARE YOU SERIOUS ? Apparently NYC cannot expect its own signed players to show up and its upto the club that has loaned the player to decide when they wish to return him? Not to mention Pelligrini dropping hints as to how Lampard could stay beyond this year. Try telling someone again as to how CFC aims for all clubs to be ran independently. 

No one looks good in this entire dealing. Not NYCFC,not MCFC and not Lampard. Such a shame.",null,0,null,1420322732,null,0,false,0,cndgrm3,null,t3_2qyao2,null,t1_cndgrm3,null,t3_2qyao2,null,null,null,1425076607,null,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1,null

&gt; The only reason why people play left vs right wing is they play on the opposite side of their preferred foot. So if i'm right footed, i'd play on LW. Why do they do this? Because when you cut inside and shoot, it's easier for you hit it with a right than to switch back to the left and shoot. You'll also get a better angle on goal this way. Coming from the left and shooting with right foot. Same goes with crossing.
Playing LW vs RW doesn't mean anything if you can use both feet effectively.

It has nothing to do with time played on one side. Most of the time you're in rotation with the opposite winger to confuse man markings. Much like we see Willian, Oscar, and Hazard doing. Sometimes Costa even joins in and rotates. 

Only a couple of people play just one side of field in the world. And to be honest, Hulk and Robben the only ones that I can think of that does this. Their right foot isn't that good. It's by far one of their biggest flaw.

This video immediately starts at the premise that privatisation is bad, full stop bad.  How come our needles are privatised?  How come our MRI machines or oxymeters are made by private firms?  Oh wait, it's because they are cheaper and better than those made by state owned firms.  This is why no one flies to Russia for their xrays.

They conflate free, vs free at point of use.  They suggest we are heading towards a two tier system, you know what... We've had this for decades.  I remember when Labour changed the rules almost two decades ago, I went from having to wait a few weeks to see a consultant, to waiting months.  The reason?  Operation waiting times were cut, they cut them, by not letting you get on the waiting list.  This kind of bullshit only happens in large organisations, the kind you find mostly state run with top down targets.  This is awful, because before the consultant put me on first cancellation waiting, so I'd only have to wait days for an operation, this changed to months.  I'll never forgive that, the pain I suffered as a child was something hard to quantify, but the time before last I suffered a fracture, it was only after dinner I finally realised it was a bad pain, I will forever be fucked up by this facet of the NHS.

They start to suggest that competition and choice are a bad thing for those at point of care of non emergency services, this is just crazy, they also use a slippery slope argument for free at point of use.

Then at the very end, they suggest they can also fix things by having more people cycle.  These externalities will not affect the NHS for decades plus.  Don't get me wrong, I'm hugely in favour of making more cycle lanes, more routes that can only be used by cyclists and power assist bicycles for those who are crippled / chronically ill / from Romford but this won't have any effect on our health for decades.

null,false,Quagers,null,null,null,"You have not understood at all, there are 2 halves to the housing market, buying and renting. They compete for the same housing stock and at any given time have differing levels of demand but neither is more important than the other.

&gt;I said that they are in it for themselves and for profit, not because they're providing some wonderful service.

It doesn't really matter, in fact that they are in it to maximise their own wealth is the very mechanism through which the market functions. Same as any other market of suppliers and consumers.

&gt;And in the current market, they guarantee that demand through reducing the supply of houses for those who can and want to buy.

Yes, thats their function, since profits (and by inference demand) is higher in the rental sector at the moment, they are meeting that demand exactly as they are meant to. The problem is the total level of demand in both markets which is controlled by housebuilding, something they don't control.

&gt;The problem here is that landlords effectively have it both ways. They set rents that prevent people from saving a deposit, because they've helped create a shortage on the other side through BTL which increases rental demand and therefore the rents they can get away with (especially in London). Since people can't save, they have no chance of buying, which means continuing to rent. Seems rather cyclical.

Total price levels again are controlled by house building, again not in their control. If they didn't exist rents would be much higher and houseprices lower, you'd have the same problem but for different reasons, until more houses are built its a zero sum game.

&gt;I don't buy the balancing argument. If a BTL landlord didn't buy the place, it'd get bought pretty quickly by an owner-occupier, such is the current demand for housing.

But then rental prices would rise exponentially, thats exactly why we need B2L landlords, for balance.

&gt;BTL would be fine if there was enough housing for people to buy and for landlords to buy to rent. There isn't.

I agree, but then why are you blaming the B2L landlords and not the government for not ensuring more house building?

&gt;The choosing to profit from the situation is exactly why it is partly their fault - it's not as if they were forced to buy a house to rent out.

Yeah but it is a good investment so why should they not, they aren't a charity. Its not their job to make sure there is a house for you to buy, that is the government.

Let me use an analogy,

Suppose you have 2 jugs of water (one for each market) with holes in the bottom (representing housing supply) and a tap at the top (representing demand). The height the water reaches in the jug is the price level in each market.

The price paid across the 2 markets is controlled by the speed of the tap (which is determined by pop. size, economic condition etc.) and the size of the hole (housebuilding). B2L investors have no control over either of those, whatever you do a set amount of water will be in the 2 jugs together. What B2L landlords do is make sure the level of the water in both jugs is level, if one starts getting much fuller than the other they just act to remove that imbalance.",null,0,null,1420324311,null,0,false,0,cndhleo,null,t3_2r7vgl,null,t1_cndhleo,null,t1_cndgi39,null,null,null,1425076224,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

&gt; ‘They were [offered new deals],’ the Chelsea boss revealed.

&gt;‘We were in this process until the end, but you arrive into a moment [where you ask] what’s the best for the team? What’s the best for the other players? What’s the best for them?

&gt;‘I think they are happier – in spite of their love for Chelsea – in this new situation for them.

&gt;‘The best way for competitive people like them to be happy, to enjoy the last part of their career, is to go and play.’

Either Lampard is lying or Mourinho/Chelsea is lying.

I'm very well aware of certain aspects of the housing market, but not the whole thing.

A large gap in my knowledge is market failure. I don't understand why the housing market is such a total disaster in the UK. All my economics knowledge says that there should have been an enormous house building boom in the past 20 years.  

I wonder if there's some kind of shenanigans going on with land. I've heard it talked about but I don't really know.

One thing that does stand out though - there are huge parts of both Scotland and England/Wales where property prices are lower than reinstatement costs. I do know that it's a bit cheaper to build a new house than rebuild a ruined one, but still it shows that the cost to build a house is too high.

If I was in government I'd be ordering a proper investigation into why house building is so expensive.

Also, as for your Hurricane theory:

http://appinsys.com/globalwarming/GW_4CE_Hurricanes_files/image004.jpg

From the site: 

“Between 1966 and 2003, US major hurricane landfall numbers were below the long-term average”. “Although global surface temperatures have increased over the last century and over the last 30 years, there is no reliable data available to indicate increased hurricane frequency or intensity in any of the globe’s seven tropical cyclone basins.  Meteorologists who study tropical cyclones have no valid physical theory as to why hurricane frequency or intensity would necessarily be altered significantly by small amounts (&lt; +/-1C) of global mean temperature change.”

&gt;  In front of the city are many monasteries and churches: these include the Orders of Saint Francis and Saint Dominic, the Church of Our Lady of the Fields, and a Presbyterian College, as well as another called Trinity College, and the Hospital of Saint Thomas.

That article goes on to mention
&gt; The lands at Kirk o' Field went on to be granted to the city specifically for the foundation of a new university, including the Hamilton lodging. The University of Edinburgh was founded by King James VI in 1582, and the Kirk o' Field site has long been considered to be at the current location of the Old College. Recent archaeological investigations following the Cowgate fire of 2002 have raised some questions about the exact location of the house.

1582 is around the time the map was written, so it may have been demolished relatively soon after!

Obviously looking at the position of their club now they would have perhaps not ended up in League Two had they still remained in the Premier League benefiting from all the TV money, but some say that winning the FA Cup is a day that you'll never forget and for fans of smaller clubs will quite possibly never be seen again in your lifetime. If you ask Mandaric or whoever the chairman was it'd be a no-brainer but for the fans it's a more difficult decision. As a fan I'd love to see us win the FA Cup even if we did go down, and to be honest I think it'd be quite interesting to see what would happen if we did get relegated to the Conference or whatever is currently being touted, it'd be a great story and it'd be great to be the biggest team in a small pond(s). And I don't really buy the argument that it's a drain on the team, it's only five extra games at the end of the day and it's not like the League Cup where it's midweek and players could suffer from a lack of rest - weekends are devoted to the FA Cup and that wouldn't have a noticeable effect on player fatigue for me, obviously there's the occupational hazards of injuries but that comes with the package.

null,false,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,null,"&gt; Willian is god awful going forward and costs us points because he can't create.

When was the last time you saw Schurrle create a goal? He has 0 assists in 13 games this season. So I guess we are watching a completely different team.

&gt;Tell me what exactly he brings to our team going forward?

Ok let me give it a shot. His dribbling ability is 100 times better than Schurrle's. This dribbling ability means he often gets out of tight spaces and opens up more space as a result. His acceleration is a lot better than Schurrle's, even if Schurrle might be quicker. 

He is way more responsible defensively than Schurrle. Why? Because you don't watch him lingering up in attack while Ivanovic is also out of position. If we were playing Schurrle instead of Willian I can guarantee you that we would've conceded more goals this season. You don't even have to believe me.. Watch the Southampton game where he contributed nothing to the team in attack or defence, and was partly at fault for the goal for giving Davis too much space.

As for Willian not being able to create:

&gt;He can't cross. As soon as he gets to a defender, he doesn't dribble past them or try to make an aggressive pass.

If they don't get a renter in a property they lose a considerable amount of money for that month - enough to wipe out 2 or 3 months profit.  They need to maintain the property too. 

A sharp, decent landlord can make a reasonable income by running a reasonable property.

Let's assume a property value of 150K and a £800 a month rent.

An interest only mortgage on 67% of the value of the property (100K) at an interest rate of 7% is £7,000 a year.

That only leaves £2,600 for costs and profit.

Assuming they manage to do it for half of that, they make £1,300 from the property.

They do also in a normal market make a bit of hidden profit. The value of the property increases while the value of the mortgage does not. Realistically there's going to be another 4 or 5K ""hidden"" profit in the property. On top of that the rent will creep up while the mortgage interest will not.

Also, right now BTL mortgage interest is lower than usual (it's not as low as residential) so there's a bit more money to be made.

But what if - and this happens often - the renter stops paying rent. 3 months later you finally get the property back and it needs £4000 of repairs. That takes 2 months and 2 months after that you find another renter. 7 months rent and £4,000 lost. 

A landlord with 10 properties will have a lot of work to do on them, it's a part time job all in itself.

I don't have an issue with professional landlords. However there is a point at which it becomes super lucrative.

If you own 150 properties you can employ agents to act on your behalf and you can do nothing, and rake in enormous amounts of cash. To combat that you need IHT.

null,false,CupformyCosta,null,null,null,"&gt;it's really only a matter of price.

No, it's clearly not just a matter of price. It's a matter of selling your brightest, most promising young player to a title rival.  Sure, OK, they would probably sell Sterling to us for 40 or 50 million because they REALLY don't want to sell him, especially to us. They have no reason nor desire to sell him at all, let alone to a direct title rival. 


&gt;Figo to Real, 

 Pretty good comparison on this list. Even at that, it's not like Figo was the brightest, youngest player on the team. 

&gt;Mata to United

Jose clearly didn't want or need Mata on the squad anymore.

&gt;Daniel to Liverpool

Chelsea didn't rate Danny after the bad season he had with us so we shipped him out at a cut rate. 

&gt;Tevez to City

Tevez was a solid player but a known disruption to the squad. City came in and offered a TON of cash and really overpaid for him. 

&gt;RVP to United

Had 1 year left on his contract and  desperately wanted to leave. And he has 29 or 30 when he transferred. Not like he had another 10+ at the top level. 

&gt;Nasari to City

Had 1 year left on his contract. Desperately wanted to leave. City still paid 2X mil for him

&gt;Cole to Chelsea

Last year of his contract. If you haven't noticed by now, Arsenal is a selling club and was *forced* to sell their star players because they all *wanted* to leave. 

&gt;Zlatan to Inter

Juve was forced to sell to Inter because of the match fixing scandal.  Damn near everybody in that team was sold but  Del Piero and Buffon. Zlatan, and most of the Juve team refused to play in Serie B so they *forced* their way out of the squad. 

&gt;Pirlo has played for the top 3 historical Italian teams ffs still killing it, 

You got me on the Move from Inter to Milan. But still, he was nowhere even close to being the amazing player he turned out to be at the time of his transfer. He was still being playing as a CAM FFS. And 
When he moved to Juve it was by way of a free transfer, we wasn't bought from Milan. 

&gt;and Frank to City.

Once again, this isn't comparable AT ALL. First, Chelsea didn't sell him. City picked him up on a free transfer. 2. He was what, 36 or 37 when he joined City on A free? It's not like he's a starlet just breaking into the first team at the age of 19. 

Most of these situations are completely different than trying to transfer Raheem Sterling from Liverpool to Chelsea.  In most situations the selling club sold because they were forced to, due to the player being on the last year of their contract and not wanting to extend. The other situations the selling club no longer needed or wanted the player or it was a free transfer. 

Raheem is set to sign a new contract very soon -extending his contract by 5 years. Obviously Raheem wants to be at Liverpool and Liverpool wants Raheem long term - making a transfer to Chelsea damn near impossible. Good day.

It looks like those guys are just taking the standard letting agency model and wrapping it up their crowd-buying scheme. 

That seems like quite a smart move for a lettings agency - having made the investment, landlords are then locked into their management services.

What seems to horrible about this is that you're basically a landlord, except you're unable to make decisions about the property, because you're in co-ownership under this operating agreement.

I don't really like this bit where it's valued every 5 years, and may be sold at the bottom of the market if one of your co-investors wants to get their money out. Presumably you could, in those circumstances, just put your money back in to another property on their crowd-funding marketplace, but I assume you'd incur the setup charge again, and there's no guarantee of getting such a good deal.

I'm no expert on this stuff, but this is just ringing a bunch of alarm bells to me. It just seems like one of these things that seems like a really good idea to people who create financial products (like packaging up bunches of mortgages into blocks for resale, or timeshares), but it's sold like it's simple and the glossy marketing is more prominent than the shortcomings.

I'm inclined to think that you'd be better off putting some money in a property based trust - looks like these are called [PAIFs Reits in the UK](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/9907051/A-buy-to-let-income-without-being-a-landlord.html). I think these will spread / hedge your money across the UK property market better (better than buying a £1000 share in a single house is to buy £10 shares in 100 houses), avoid any side-effects or hidden fees of this PropertyPartner crowd-funding structure.

The managers of a fund have only one job - to make their investors money.

No it isn't, I can't think of a socialist country that doesn't persecute people due to religion, in most of them its out right banned.

&gt;Support for a monarchist system is also a right wing trait. You can be left wing while still passively supporting it, but to take up arms to 'defend' the right to have a monarchy is not a left wing thing.

Well our current monarchy system wouldn't be terribly left friendly, but I could imagine a few systems that would be still monarchist. And let's not forget that the laws on succession are controlled by parliament. I don't think anyone's claiming the PUP are full on Marxists, but they are definitely left of centre.

&gt;Just because they have varying degrees of severity doesn't mean it wasn't on the extreme right, pro empire, anti-republican (who, back then, had left wing and socialist ideals). 

I don't know where your going with this.

&gt;We had a shoot to kill system in place at one time, you need to remember that - and you best believe it was indeed real. 

I'm surprised we ever had a shoot to wound policy. You shoot until the threat isn't a threat anymore. If you have to draw your gun there's no help in faffing around.

&gt; Just because Catholics were better off, doesn't mean they were anywhere near equal. 

The entire working class didn't have it too good, that's why NI Labour was on the rise before the troubles.

&gt;So my point is still there. Kennedy, while he spouted all this liberal bullshit, was still right wing - don't forget he invaded Cuba (Bay of Pigs) because they were Communist - don't forget he played his part in bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war because Cuba brought in tactical, deterrent nukes to stop further invasion. Doesn't sound like much of a lefty.

K

&gt;Yes, indeed they did - and it's a shame they did too, that is indefensible. But no, they aren't right wing - SF, at least they say so, are working toward what was proclaimed in 1916 - a socialist republic. A lot of their targets in the troubles were economical, symbolic, and/or tactical as well (which cannot be said for the UVF), but yes I agree and condemn any and all civilian casualties that died.

Well the tactical aim of the UVF was to maintain the status quo, anything that would have disrupted movements to change that could be viewed as a tactical target. Which isn't to say it was moral to attack those targets.

&gt; Good for Dr Kyle and Mrs Purvis, they sound like good people - but for being such lefties, and for Dr Kyle to be led by a man who to this day says he doesn't regret shooting dead two civilian catholics 'because it helped save the union', while Kyle shouts down racism etc...

Policing is planned to become more equal:
&gt; ""Greater emphasis on ensuring diversity in all levels of policing so that they include people from a range of backgrounds including people from black and ethnic minorities, different sexual orientations, various faiths, trans people, and other social and cultural backgrounds, and are more equal in the employment of men and women.""

The reduction of women is part of a greater plan to reduce unfair prison population as well:
&gt; CJ340 Wholly unacceptable levels of men, women and children are currently imprisoned at great cost to their future rehabilitation, as well as to their families, the taxpayer and society in general. The Green Party is therefore committed to significantly reducing the prison population. To that end, a range of measures will be used, including changes to sentencing policy and practice. Courts will have a duty to reduce use of custodial sentencing in favour of community sentencing. (See also 'Immediate Prison Reforms' section, below.)

This is the policy of concern for those curious:
&gt; CJ381 Recognising the nature of the female prison population, with high levels of mental illness, experience of being a victim of crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence, and caring responsibilities for children, the only women who should be in custody are those very few that commit serious and violent crimes and who present a threat to the public.

Note how this will only apply to women under certain criteria:
&gt; CJ382 For the vast majority of women in the criminal justice system, solutions in the community are more appropriate. Community sentences must be designed to take account of women’s particular vulnerabilities and domestic and childcare commitments. The restrictions placed on sentencers around breaches of community orders must be made more flexible.

If this is of concern, you can also raise this to be addressed at their next conference to be voted.

I don't see how making an already unequal sentencing system even more unbalanced helps anyone.

The argument of the 'best solution' is also disingenuous; as with to the rest of the Green's manifesto it doesn't show any awareness of limitations and instead shows unrealisable idealism.

I found working more than 18 hours Monday to Friday badly impacted my grades. You also need to make sure you can get a job when you graduate, so add extra-curricular activies and work experience into your time calculations.

I would say that your best bet would be to do part time course over 6 years, if you are committed to working full time, it takes longer but may be more manageable.

Other options:

Call the accommodation office of the uni and ask if they do full year lets (there are normally some available for medics, care leavers and masters students).

Get a normal student let, and a short term let for the summer. Work part time and get a full time summer job. This would give you the added option to move for better paying seasonal work.

Look into other forms of financial support. Depending on what your recent events are you may be able to claim that you are unsupported by your parents, which would entitle you to more help.

Finally, please don't worry about student loans they aren't really a big deal. In practice it isn't really counted as debt (unlike consumer loans) and most people pay very little back each month.

&gt;Yes and youve completely avoided discussing the issue other than saying Farage is being ""silly"" when hes being racist. 

What I meant is that what Farage said was a bit stupid, he wasn't being racist though, he was stating that he'd be worried to live next to a group of Romanians in London because they commit a lot of crimes in that area.


&gt;We havent talked at all about anti-science. Its called denial.

Well we did touch on it already but I'm happy to outline it again for you. I don't agree with UKIP's policy on climate change however but I do think that our country isn't exactly the one which needs to do more for being green, it would be very reckless however to reduce our green controls too much.

&gt;Ukip have much in common with the EDL/BNP/extreme right of the tories even without their unanimous agreement over race. 

How so? Could you list me some common policies between the BNP and UKIP?

&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10741121/Nick-Clegg-v-Nigel-Farage-Hey-ladies-Nigel-Farages-Ukip-wants-to-turn-the-clock-back-for-womens-rights.-Fact.html

For this article, I think that what Farage was saying was that Women can be less valuable to employer rather often because they often take time off for maternity leave, this means the business has to pay an employee which isn't doing any work.

http://politicalscrapbook.net/2014/05/nigel-farage-ive-got-so-many-women-pregnant-over-the-years/

It doesn't sound like something he'd say at all and I feel as if it may have been made up, I found the source for the original interview and I can't find any proper info about that site/magazine and it looks incredibly dodgy, if he did say that however, paint me disgusted.

&gt;http://westminsterwomen.wordpress.com/2014/09/30/as-ukip-grow-as-the-peoples-party-a-reminder-that-to-ukip-women-are-not-people/

I assume the things they are listing there about UKIP are things from the 2010 manifesto which has been disowned? I disagree with those policies as is but the last one about voting is wrong as UKIP tends to abstain on voting on the vast majority of issues anyway.

&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/20/nigel-farage-women-sacrifice-family-succeed-finance-ukip

This is saying a similar thing to what I talked about about with other article with Nick Clegg above, it's not sexist to say Women are likely to take time off work for maternity leave when having a baby, it's simply something which is likely to happen as businesses tend not to care about morals, they just wish to save money which can be done by employing those which don't go on maternity leave.

&gt;http://jackiebrodie.mycouncillor.org.uk/2014/04/06/ukip-meps-vote-against-equal-pay/

Could you get me a better link about UKIP mep's voting against equal pay for Women? I'd like to read about it further so I can give a better response.

&gt;http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-21355197

I've read that one before, it's kind of worrying in a way, I'd assume it isn't true though because there are plenty of women in the party now and even women MEPs and they don't appear to have similar criticism, if they come out and start saying the same thing I'll start worrying further.

&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10256179/Feminists-mocked-by-Bongo-bongo-Ukip-man-Godfrey-Bloom.html

Well Godfrey Bloom was a bit of an idiot, I'm rather glad he is no longer a member of the party.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ukip-mep-women-dont-have-the-ambition-to-get-to-the-top-because-babies-get-in-the-way-8967511.html

I think the way he put it wasn't particularly nice but the point stands similarly to what I said before, a business is forced to pay a woman's wages while she doesn't do work for the company, this can cripple smaller companies especially where they rely heavily on somebody to complete a job or contract.

&gt;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ukip-handed-fresh-embarrassment-as-backer-demetri-marchessini-claims-theres-no-such-thing-as-marital-rape-9308272.html

As the article says, UKIP have previously disagreed with his views and he by no means represents UKIP. Turning down his massive donation however would be a rather reckless decision for a business/party to make in my opinion.

&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/23/nigel-farage-ukip-2010-election-manifesto

This is the same thing as I've said above about Women and maternity pay, as for the rest of the article we are certainly waiting for the 2015 election manifesto so we'll see how that goes in the future :)

Thanks for finding those links for me.

 You contradicted yourself. It is a matter of price if I offer 50m for Raheem, you're bound to accept. 
 
 
Half of your list includes large offers which is what I just said is the main reason why people would be sold to a rival. NOT your title/historical rival reason. The main issue is selling to direct rivals, you're trying to throw things saying that was the reason, but they STILL could have sold their players to teams that aren't rivals, yet they allowed direct rivals to buy them. Players that fall under that category are Nasari, Cole, Tevez, RVP, Sagna, Danny, Mata. 

I don't care about XYZ. If you're a good player, and they sell you to a rival, you can fit in this list. All your exceptions are pointless. They had offers from other teams, but went with the rival team. That being said my list is perfectly fine. You can throw Frank out of there because of his age if you want. But it's still selling to direct rivals.

Since you're being nit picky about a case that best fits Raheems situation. Neuer to Bayern is a prime example (only around 24/25 when traded to bayern) which in Goalkeeper years is very young considering he can still play  world class football for another 10 years. But you're probably going to bitch about that one and say he isn't the same age as Raheem, so let's get a little closer. Mario Gotze (21 at the time), don't have to say anything bout that one. Do you want me to get closer to his age? Huntelaar was 20 when he traded to Ajax. Raheem is 20 right now, don't think I can get any closer to that. If I really wanted to, I can find someone younger that got traded to a league rival.

The whole point is that saying ""Romanian people are known to commit crimes"" is a racist thing to say in isolation. Why do SOME Romanians commit crime here? Because we won't give them jobs and because we are taking steps to deny them welfare. In those circumstances what choice do they have but to commit crime to put food in their mouths? I know plenty of Romanians who work hard and try to fit in, like Poles 10 years ago, like Serbians 20 years ago, like Caribbean immigrants 50 years ago.

&gt;__Pando__ ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) for ""I spread""), also known as __The Trembling Giant__,   is a [clonal colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonal_colony) of a single male [quaking aspen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populus_tremuloides) (*[Populus tremuloides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populus_tremuloides)*) determined to be a single living organism by identical genetic markers  and assumed to have one massive underground [root system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root). The plant is estimated to weigh collectively 6,000,000 kg (6,600 short [tons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton)),  making it the [heaviest known organism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_organisms).  The root system of Pando, at an estimated 80,000 years old, is among the [oldest known living organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_long-living_organisms).

Quoting wikipedia as I think it's a good source for neutral facts (some of which are disputed and need to be looked at in detail, like exact dates and agreements between parts). If you know of a better neutral source, please do tell me, [This is the article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands):

&gt; In 1766, France surrendered its claim on the Falklands to Spain.

This means they had been claimed by both french and british captains, with the french claim being surrendered to spain. As they were from spain, when argentina gained independence and got all our lands it is only logic that spain gave us the islands too. I'd love some more serious information about this, like what exact territories was part of the spain-&gt;argentina.

&gt;No. We never left the islands voluntarily. The Spanish invaded and captured the Islands by force. Also, this was in 1770, not 1774.

From wikipedia:
&gt; Both the British and Spanish settlements coexisted in the archipelago until 1774, when Britain's new economic and strategic considerations led it to voluntarily withdraw from the islands, leaving a plaque claiming the Falklands for King George III.

As far as I read it seems the spanish did capture the port in 1770 but agreed to let them back without a fight in 1771 (the letters between both parts are linked somewhere in this discussion but I could not find them again.).

The problem in my opinion of basing arguments in the timespan between 1832 capture and now, is that argentina goverment has been protesting and trying to recover them since 1833. /u/Nidaeae posted a good [analogy](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2r216c/british_people_opinion_on_the_malvinasfalklands/cnd0waq) on why we argue that the current islanders are not a people, but a british population. Since by the moment the brtish re-claimed the islands in 1832 both spanish and british had claims and ports on the island.

Positioning yourself back in 1833 and ignoring anything that happened later is not a solution, I know that. Islanders should be given a say in the matter, but the fact that we have been trying to recover since the moment that they were re-taken, should also be taken in mind.

About the questions on the second part:

Most people are worried about other day-to-day stuff, It's not an immediate worry, more along the lines of: ""yes they are ours, I guess we can't recover them, well what's for dinner today?"".

Young people get flood by propaganda so they support it, but don't know why, then young adults probably start doubting it and not caring too much. And older generations either totally lost interest or are very supportive of it. Basically we start thinking they because we are told so, and when we start being able to think for ourselves we make our own desitions, which might go one side or the other. On this matter a poll would be an interesting idea, but it would have to reach a very diverse part of the population to make sense.

I'm not sure if it was totally implemented yet, the law was from last week, and the posters should have been up by yesterday, but probably there are lots that still don't have them ,haven't travelled in bus since tuesday last week(yay vacations) so I can't say. And the law said they should have the message by yesterday, so they probably do, or will have it very soon.

That cartoon is pure and basic propaganda, it has varios bullshit facts (like spain reaching the islands before both britain and the french). I think some parents complained about the misinformation but it still was shown to some kinds in some schools by their teachers.

null,false,strifeblood,null,null,null,"&gt; When was the last time you saw Schurrle create a goal? He has 0 assists in 13 games this season. So I guess we are watching a completely different team.

Are you just plain stupid? How many minutes has he played compared to Willian? How many times has he played with most of the starting XI compared to Willian? This is literally the dumbest argument I've seen here. As if a player who's been ill and out of the form the limited chances he gets is going to do as much compared to a starting XI player who has played almost every game. Even then Willian's stats suck. You do realize that Willian has exactly one assist in all the PL games he started? Ramires has 3 and even Dave and Matic have 2 assists each, right? Even last season he had 1 assist in like 33 games or something. Schurrle had 2 last season. He also put up an assist on the platter for Costa his second to last game (before Southampton), but the striker fluffed the chance.

&gt; His dribbling ability is 100 times better than Schurrle's. This dribbling ability means he often gets out of tight spaces and opens up more space as a result. His acceleration is a lot better than Schurrle's, even if Schurrle might be quicker.

First of all, calm down with the hypberole. He's a better dribbler but not anywhere the extent you're making it out to be. If even he was 100 times better, it means fuck all if he rarely does anything with it. Watch him closely every game. The majority of the time he's looking for the easy option. He never attempts to dribble past players like Hazard, Oscar, Fabregas or even fucking Matic. Every game he receives a pass and passes it sideways or backwards the second he reaches a defender. 

&gt; He is way more responsible defensively than Schurrle. Why? Because you don't watch him lingering up in attack while Ivanovic is also out of position. If we were playing Schurrle instead of Willian I can guarantee you that we would've conceded more goals this season. You don't even have to believe me.. Watch the Southampton game where he contributed nothing to the team in attack or defence, and was partly at fault for the goal for giving Davis too much space.

Schurrle isn't as good defensively, but people exaggerate Willian's work rate so much it's fucking laughable. Have you ever thought if Willian wasn't so utterly incompetent that Ivanovic wouldn't need to go forward as much? If Ivanovic isn't up there, we get little to no production from the right side. Plus, you act like Schurrle doesn't track back. He does his fair share like Hazard or Oscar. Just because he's not as good tackling doesn't mean he's not as responsible. I like how you use the Southampton game because we actually scored when Schurrle was on and didn't when Willian was on. Plus, if you want to talk about conceding goals Willian was at 100% fault for the Danny Rose goal in the Tottenham game. Go ahead, watch that goal again and pay attention to him.

&gt; As for Willian not being able to create:, Willian can't shoot., He can't cross. As soon as he gets to a defender, he doesn't dribble past them or try to make an aggressive pass.

Are you seriously with the 3 links each? I could do the same thing with Schurrle and it would accomplish nothing. Anybody can get the highlights out of an entire season and make a scrub look world class. Consistency is what I'm talking about, not that if he can do these things because he's capable. He just doesn't do anything near as often for Chelsea quality. He doesn't create if you watch him every game, he's a passenger. You're delusional if you think Willian has a decent shot because it's extremely inconsistent. His crosses are garbage 90% of the time. 

&gt; Charlie Adam can do that too.. Shall we bring him into this team too?

What? This comment is so idiotic that I'm not even sure what to say.

&gt; Lol ok bud.

My bad here. I made a mistake and mean to say Schurrle was not as good, but I forgot to fix it.

Cuba. Vietnam. China. Nordic socialist countries, if you count them (I kind of don't). It's only really been persecuted against in the USSR, and we all know that the USSR is the reason socialism gets a bad name.

&gt; I'm surprised we ever had a shoot to wound policy. You shoot until the threat isn't a threat anymore. If you have to draw your gun there's no help in faffing around.

Shoot to kill was used on unarmed and sometimes civilian targets. Source: shoot to kill victim in my own family.

&gt; Well the tactical aim of the UVF was to maintain the status quo, anything that would have disrupted movements to change that could be viewed as a tactical target. Which isn't to say it was moral to attack those targets.

Maintain the status quo by shooting dead mostly random targets - bit mental, bit devoid of any kind of tactical vision. Sure, hitting IRA members, I can see the tactics there - but random civilians on the streets is a bit of a stretch.

That said, loans do work. The problem is we don't seem to have a plan once their loan ends. At the end of a successful loan, or a couple of successful loans in a few cases, the next logical step would be to give the youth a chance but for one reason or another we can't seem to do that. 

While we are on the topic, I think too much emphasis is placed on youths ""impressing"" out on loan, don't get me wrong that is always a bonus and makes your case stronger but the point of a loan is to access a players weakness and strengths and see how and/or if that can be integrated into the first team. I assume the scouts at Chelsea are fully aware of this and that this is more of a fan mentality (mainly on this sub) but after seeing how we have failed to capitalise on a few youths I'm not so sure. 

I have next to zero faith in the loan system in regards to bring through youth players.

The Day of the Doctor was basically a bullshit reset button that turned the Doctor into a Jesus Christ like savior of all time and space. The fact that he murdered his people for the good of the whole galaxy was *interesting*, and it made the Doctor *interesting.* Moffat erasing that cheapened the whole show. When 12 was questioning whether he was a good man or not, it didn't feel at all plausible because *duh you're a good man,* especially after Day of the Doctor. 

Season 8 was boring because it was childlike. A fucking dragon coming out of an egg sounds like something that a kid would think of. Besides Danny **did you know i was a soldier**, I don't see how this season was geared more towards adults at all. Its the writing all around that is killing the show.

which brings me back to my original point that us paying that much for raheem is completely unrealistic. And that's probably around what they would make us pay for a player like Raheem. Completely unrealistic to expect us to pay that much for him. 

&gt;they STILL could have sold their players to teams that aren't rivals, yet they allowed direct rivals to buy them.

That's if the player accepted a deal from other teams. Look at RvP,  Arsenal had offers from teams all over Europe for him but he only wanted to go to Manchester United which forced Arsenals hand. It was either sell to a title rival for 25mil or lose him for free. 

&gt;in regards to frank..But it's still selling to direct rivals.

What the..really? You really think we sold frank to city? You don't seem to understand the concept of a free transfer. We released frank after his contract expired meaning he could sign for ANY team. Chelsea has absolutely ZERO control over what team he signed for. We didn't sell him to a title rival.  

&gt;Mario Gotze (21 at the time), don't have to say anything bout that one

Lol, now you're just embarrassing yourself and showing how clueless you are. Dortmund didn't have a choice in the matter. Bayern activated his release clause (im not going to explain that one to you..look it up) and offered him a contract which he accepted. Dortmund didn't even get contacted from Bayern with an offer because all Bayern had to do was wire the money to Dortmund (after gotze accepted a contract) and the deal was done. Dortmund didn't willingly sell gotze, Bayern activated his release clause. The same thing could happen with rues. Bayern could activate his release clause and he would be on Bayern the next year if he accepted terms and there is NOTHING Dortmund could do about it. 

You're still ignoring my main point about most of the players you listed. The reason the selling club was even tempted to sell in the first place is because they were unwanted or had less than a year on their contracts left. Liverpool and Raheem are definitely not in that situation AT ALL. In fact Raheem is about to sign a new 5yr deal which would raise his price even HIGHER. They don't want to sell which makes it unrealistic unless we were to pay WAY too much for him. It's not going to happen, it's unrealistic.

Basically it boils down to a war between the Brownites (such as Ed) and Blairites (such as David) coupled with a potential funding crisis resulting in a big push by the unions to back the pro-union Ed in exchange for the funding. The result was a two horse race from the start split right down the middle of the two factions but ultimately favouring the candidate backed by the unions, for the reasons I will explain below.

Due to the way a Labour leadership election is organised members of the party, Labour MPs/MEPs and lastly affiliated organisations may vote. The last one is key because the last group is pretty much dominated by unions, who were strongly advised by the union to vote for Ed to maintain influence with the party because of the aforementioned funding.

This table here shows it pretty clearly:

http://archive.labour.org.uk/votes-by-round

Ordinary members of the party consistently voted for David but affiliated organisations consistently voted for Ed and also outnumbered the normal members.

Is that really true outside of London? Where I live if you earn 30k, you can live in a nice flat in an OK area, or a 2up/2down in a relatively crap area. However, among my peers what tends to keep people at home with parents or renting is that they want more than this.

How can you not see that you're only looking at your own narrow self interest?? I'm helping create a shortage in stock to *buy*, and in doing so making more property available to *rent*.

The [Granton History](http://www.grantonhistory.org/streets/street_index_map.htm) site has some decent insight into place names across the northern side of Edinburgh, similarly [Tollcross Online](http://www.tollcross.org/visit-tollcross/derivation-of-local-street-names/) has coverage for a fair chunk of areas, though not Hunter Square!  The site I had in mind was much simpler, just a series of big two-column tables with street name on the left and a brief precis of the origin on the right.

http://www.british-history.ac.uk/topographical-dict/scotland is another interesting resource for many place names, but again, not Hunter Square.

[This book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Place-Names-Edinburgh-Origins/dp/1904246060) looks to be a good bet, but it's not particularly cheap (wonder if the libraries have a copy or two, mind you).

&gt; Over the years Edinburgh expanded rapidly in both size and power. In 1920 it was suggested that Leith be merged with Edinburgh and become part of the larger city. A referendum was held and Leithers rejected the idea by a huge majority. In the great traditions of democracy, those in control decided to simply ignore the vote and the merger went ahead anyway. Leith was forcibly merged with Edinburgh by Act of Parliament - though as a concession the name ""Port of Leith"" was preserved.

2) That's only one case, i've named at least 20 here. Stop acting like that disproves my point. 

2.5) Just look at this stupid statement:

&gt; look at RvP, Arsenal had offers from teams all over Europe for him but he only wanted to go to Manchester United which forced Arsenals hand

Do you not know clubs have to accept bids from other clubs before a player says I want to go there? Arsenal accepted Man Utd's bid, allowing RVP force his way in there. Jose was just about to allow Ba to go to Arsenal until he learned that Ozil went there. He rejected their bid blocking him from going there. 


3) Yes, have you not seen the news recently? Frank never signed with NYFC. He signed with City directly. 

4)Fair enough. Remove Mario, but your dumbass still ignored Huntelaar and Neuer's case. Fucking nit picky dumbass. 

5) Dear god you're clueless. Raheem hasn't signed anything. Until he does it's up in the air what he does. Remember when Kroos was ABOUT to resign? Look what happened. ""Oh but he wanted to leave for the longest time"", but several people expected him to resign including Beckenbauer. We all know about Ashley Cole driving off the road. We know about Rooney almost leaving. We know about Di Maria. We know about Ibra. We know about David Luiz.

Also, you're fucking retarded. If your club has a great player, you're going to be tempted to sell, especially if your club isn't living up to top flight standards.

The only person on that list was unwanted is Tevez, Mata, and Danny. The rest were forced sales because the club wasn't preforming good enough (AKA Liverpool right now). Or upgraded teams transfers. Or better pay grade. Having a less than a year left on contract means fuck all. People resign all the time with less than a year left. People leave all the time with a year left, having a year left means nothing but ""i'm keeping my options open"".

You're fucking being nit picky af. Don't nit pick just one thing I said. I gave you Gotze, Neuer, and Huntelaar. Your ass only rejected Gotze understandably. But there is no way in hell you can reject Neuer and Huntelaar. At the end of the day there is no exact Raheem case. Nothing in life is an exact copy of something that happened before. There is similar cases, but the main issue here is selling to title rivals. Which is what every single person on the list excluding Gotze is involved in. 

If you don't come up with truly reasonable reasons that clubs don't sell to rivals, i'm just not going to respond to you flat out. Half of your shit doesn't even make sense, and i've given you several examples (all fined tuned just to fit your BS argument) that go against what you are saying. Your standpoint is ""Oh, but it's not like Raheem case"", but it doesn't have to be like Raheem for the club to give him to a title rival does it? No, it doesn't. I've given you young players who have 8+ years left in their career, who have been sold to title rivals. Just stop dude.


TL;DR: If you're going to be a nit picky little bitch, nit pick everything I said. I've giving you good examples. Stop trying to shove them back at me like they are ""wrong"". They are perfectly acceptable. I'll take back Gotze, but Neuer and Klaas are still acceptable.

The reason that the debt to GDP ratio is important is now that it's the central tenant behind debt issues now is that it drives government bond yield at a time when debt interest is a reasonable component of government expenditure. Driving down the deficit during a bust and recovery is difficult to say the least.

When Labour was in power the fact that interest rates were higher was irrelevant because debt was a fraction of what it is now. Similarly, not building a surplus during boom years is a sign of weak fiscal responsibility. It's much easier to be the good guy when it's easy to be than be the bad guy when it's easy to be.

Why would the state pay for extra prisons that they won't fill? 

You could, instead, move people further from home, and separate women into non-violent/violent offenders prisons, but what effect will that have on a woman's family? They have not committed any crimes - why should they be punished? 

&gt; or equally men should be included in this exemption

That wouldn't necessarily be for the best. Maybe it's more expensive to have a criminal do a community sentence than a short stay in a non-violent offenders prison. Maybe people sent to a non-violent offenders prison are less likely to reoffend than people with community sentences. Maybe prisoners actually would prefer a month in prison over 2 years of community work. There are any number of reasons why it would be preferable to send a person to a non-violent offenders prison over a giving them a community sentence. 

You and I are not experts on the prison system and/or criminal justice, so we cannot possibly hope to say what is the best way to deal with women and men who commit crimes. Unless you want to go off and do some research. The Green party policy is based on the opinion of experts. For example, [see this article](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2014/apr/22/prison-women-trauma-stephanie-covington) that was linked elsewhere.

&gt; I don't see how making an already unequal sentencing system even more unbalanced helps anyone.

It might help the state, the offenders or society in general. Maybe we'd have fewer reoffenders, or there'd be less psychological damage to children of criminals, or the state would save money, or some other reason. The simple fact that it's ""unbalanced"" doesn't mean that it doesn't help anyone. 

&gt; The argument of the 'best solution' is also disingenuous; as with to the rest of the Green's manifesto it doesn't show any awareness of limitations and instead shows unrealisable idealism. Shown by their fanatic hatred of nuclear power, which is by far recognised by most as the 'best solution' for emission free long term power.

He has to improve, with Sakho next to him and consistent protection from Lucas or a new DM who knows whether it can work out, hopefully it does.

Yeah Coutinho is the key to our midfield imo, I prefer him being able to come deep to collect the ball, he could eventually be similar to Modric imo.

I'm not sure you would play him in a two for the same reasons as I gave for Lallana but he could play in the 8 role with Lucas behind, Henderson beside and Lallana at the point effectively. The pros you get from letting coutinho dictate the play far outweigh the loss of defensive presence in this particular formation, and, even then, Coutinho is a good presser who, as long as he resists the temptation to dive in (which he does slightly too often - understandably), he nicks the ball back more than you'd probably expect.

There is quite a lot of cross party support for changing how we treat women offenders.

One of the recommendations from that report was that custodial sentences should be avoided except for the most serious and violent. Even some Tories support the Green party stance on this.

Above and beyond anything you may owe in taxes which, as you've stated, is probably nothing as long as you're a normal salaried worker with a tiny pension and almost no investments at all, the new craze is [FATCA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act) (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act), which compels all financial institutions worldwide to report information about their American account holders to the IRS. This is to make sure no one is stashing away money somewhere and forgetting to declare it on their 1040.

This is having some *serious* ramifications, way more than most of the taxation ones you've listed. I know a guy who lives in Singapore who was passed over for promotion because he'd become a signatory on their corporate accounts, and their bank wasn't willing to have a US citizen on their books due to the extra paperwork involved in submitting information to the IRS. Evidently this is becoming more common - Americans not getting the management positions due to potential liability to report financial information. I've heard so many stories in the last year of people throughout Europe going from 'I'm a happy dual citizen' to 'I've got to get rid of my US citizenship as soon as possible' when their married life started to take a hit because their non-US spouse was being denied financial products from banks due to being a joint signatory on their accounts.

It's an absolutely fucking insane situation and something should really be done. Oh well, at least you can always renounce - pay shitloads of fees to do so, wait for ages for your paperwork, and then be named and shamed as an official ex-citizen in Congressional records.

Perhaps you can answer and show you understand.

&gt;To answer your question about why he was not sacked for saying racist things, isn't this obvious? One, he very quickly backtracked and said he was tired and mis-spoke. This in itself was a good play, allowing him to get away with saying an objectionable thing that some British people agree with, but also appearing human and willing to accept that he can make mistakes. How often do politicians do that? It's so rare that when Clegg did it in 2012 it was made into a silly song. Second and more importantly, Farage IS the party as far as most UKIP supporters are concerned. UKIP was lost when he wasn't the leader, he is the keystone of the party holding it's campaign and momentum together. This is true of any party. Nick Clegg is hugely unpopular but he's still at the helm of the Lib Dems, Ed Miliband comes across as incompetent and not Prime Ministerial but Labour are going to let him have a run at the top Office rather than risk a leadership battle and a split in the party. Even if Farage were forced to step down there is no clear successor and he resonates well with the sections of the public UKIP seek to gain electoral support from. The fact that he is still at the helm does nothing to demonstrate that UKIP is a racist party, it shows they are being politically pragmatic and playing what they see to be their best hand. A political party putting electoral pragmatism over high-minded principle? That makes them just like all the other ones then, doesn't it?

null,false,el_matt,null,null,null,"It really depends on where you live as ""the going rate"" varies from town to town. Comparing how much you're paying to the average rent in the city may inform your decision regarding if it's fair or not. For example, as a student in Exeter I was paying £78 per week to my landlord, but the average student rent in the city was £96pw (plus bills etc).

Now I'm elsewhere, the average rent in shared accommodation (not just students) is £75pw. But utility bills are £15 on top of that, council tax is £2.50 for a small flat and internet costs £6pw if you include line rental. If you have a TV too then the TV license costs you £4pw. So the rent for one person is £75 and the extras for the whole household would be about £30 per week, or £15 per person. Plus food (between £15-25 per week depending how you shop) that means if you were in my city you'd be paying about £100 per week on the commercial market (this sum tallies with some mates of mine who pay £400pm so I'm inclined to think it's right, my case is a little different since I own my flat so my payments aren't the same).

If you get a ""family discount"" I would say 70-80 per week would be reasonable, so you probably are underpaying a little, assuming where you live is similar.


Edit: seeing as your mum doesn't pay any rent or mortgage she's having a laugh.

A giant pile of debunked shite is not of equal value to scientific evidence. 

Let's start on your list of ""respected"" deniers. Steve McIntyre. Two seconds of googling later: http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2011/03/09/207662/inhofe-watts-horner-mcintyre-michael-mann-email/

Oh big surprise. Not respected. Prettying damn far from being respected actually. Debunked many times but keeps trying to shout down people. Borderline libellous. Crank. 

Life's too short for the others, which you probably cut and pasted from done denialist blog but I bet you dollars to donuts they're all the same. Or at *best* someone quoted massively out of context whose retraction you ignore (remember your first link?) 

By the way about that: does the use if tactics like that by your side ever give you pause, stick in your throat or make you stop and *think*? To repurpose a phrase from the American takedown of McCarthy ""Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?""

Blah blah big conspiracy shouting down denialist papers: no they don't, they take them apart. Easily. 

Big green - roflmao. Do you actually believe that? Can't move round your way for multimillionaire climate scientists with their brand new sports cars? 
I've said this several tines now: it's obvious that the fossil fuel interests have orders of magnitude more money than exists in government and university funding - so if climate scientists were in it for the money they'd be arguing the other way. You boldly claim the opposite is true which is the most unconvincing statement yet (and that's against some fairly stiff competition). ""Big lie theory"" is the only reason I can think of for you to persist in such a transparently obvious falsehood. 

Extraordinary claims -likewise roflmao. Stop aping the terms used by your betters, you aren't using them appropriately. They *have* the evidence. They've been gathering it for decades and refining it further. Your sources keep trying to attack and disprove it and fail pretty much every time because the models and data are in fact pretty incontrovertible now. 

Faith? Don't make me sick. Evidence. Data. Models. Predictions. Projecting your own shortcomings much?

Oh diddums, you are fed up with discussions about climate. Hey everyone, let's take pointless huge risks with the world of our children and grandchildren because kingoftgejaffacakes is getting bored with being calked out when he spraffs lies, half truths and cut and pasted denialist propaganda!

I'm not trying to convince you by the way. If logic, data, integrity or even the scientific method could sway you it would have done so already.  I just don't care to leave such dangerous misinformation unanswered.

Your ongoing relentless diatribe does little but describe your own jaded psychopathy and neurosis.

If you own a 3 bed house in England or Scotland kept a reasonable standard, yes, obviously the mortgage usually comes in lower than the basic rent. However the not inconsiderable other costs of owning a house are not covered by the rent and the margins are generally very very small outside London. Having to replace a gas boiler for example will likely cancel out any profit for that year. These great profits you imagine are a fiction because you want to hate the model, not because they are real. Any profits will be subject to cgt or corporation tax anyway. Btl only sounds good on paper because the balance sheet of the companies owning them is so large.

Potential owner-occupiers cannot keep up ( will not get the mortgage) to cover the prices B2L pay- however the B2L can just increase the rent they charge to cover the inflated price. The renter has no choice.

Yes, I disagree with none of this, because that is exactly how the mechanism is meant to work. 

Landlords can charge those rents because demand in the rental market is so high, so you get high profits from renting, so more people B2L, moving the supply to cover the demand. This is exactly what I have been describing for the last 3 posts. This is how the market is meant to work.

The problem is that there aren't enough houses, so prices will always rise across the board until that changes, not B2L landlords fault.

&gt;You blame the government for not building more affordable housing, but I have a hunch you'd be set against that promise at election time.

Now you are just casting unfounded aspersions about my beliefs. I have no strong opinion on social housing but I do believe we need less planning regulation and a more streamlined planning application process to incentivise private building.

In the absence of large scale 'social housing' then something has to be done to resolve that tension. Rent controls is an option, more social housing is another. 

If nothing is done to solve the housing problem though, at some point, probably not too far away, the system breaks. People end up too far away from places of work and start quitting.

Apart from the TV adverts and supermarkets selling Christmassy things (both of which seem to start after halloween nowadays!), from early December many 'preparations' begin to happen. Town centres decorate the streets with Christmas lights and put up a big tree, usually a local 'celebrity' turns them on before a crowd of people; homes are likewise decorated with a tree (either real or artificial) and other decorations. People send each other Christmas cards and purchase gifts, and shop at  Christmas markets that spring up. Parties are a big thing both in the workplace and at schools, where everybody can take time out and just socialise with colleagues and classmates.

Christmas and new year themselves are seen as a chance to 'reboot' for most people, no school or work and time with family and friends.

[Pantomime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantomime) is a big pre-Christmas tradition, and many primary schools will have a trip to a pantomime (read especially the section on modern traditions).

The day after Christmas is called Boxing Day in the UK and is a public holiday (aka bank holiday). Mostly we just eat leftovers on Boxing Day; there's a running national joke about Turkey sandwiches. There are also football matches on Boxing Day, which forms part of the Christmas tradition for some families.

Some businesses will entirely close down between Christmas and New Year, although this is a tradition that's dying out. Of those that do open, many will be run on a minimal number of staff to allow people to see their families. Besides the obvious emergency services that are open the whole way through, the biggest exception is retail workers as the period between Christmas and New Year is traditionally our biggest sales period and some of the biggest discounts are available during this time. It's not uncommon to leave big purchases until the Boxing Day sales.

It's very common for families to buy a huge tub of chocolates (usually Quality Street, Roses or Celebrations, and we're talking 700g+ per tub) to eat over the festive season. Every family will have its own rules about when it can be opened; for example, as a family of shift workers, we're not allowed to open ours until the last person comes home from work on Christmas Eve.

There isn't actually that much regional variation on Christmas in the UK.

Food and drink - run up to Christmas it's all mince pies, Yule log and Baileys. On the day it's roast turkey, with usual trimmings: sprouts are universally deplored but still served. In the days afterwards we eat leftovers as much as possible. Families spend ridiculous amounts on food for Christmas, grandparents even more. Christmas crackers are on the table with Xmas Dinner. These are famously tacky with rubbish jokes and silly hats to wear. 

Presents are done on Xmas Day. Most do it as the first thing they do when they wake up, especially if they have young children, though some do it after dinner. 

Carol singing is still a thing in pop culture though I haven't personally had any in a few years. Everyone knows the words to classics such as ""Away in a manger"", "" Hark the Herald"" and ""Silent Night"". Schools often have concerts in the weeks leading up to Christmas for parents and those in the community to come and watch of students singing carols. 

Christmas TV is massive. The Christmas Special of the current trending sitcom will easily be the most watched thing over the period, closely followed by the Christmas Day episodes of the nation's favourite soap operas. This year Mrs Brown's Boys was the most watched show over Christmas. The TV guides release special editions for Christmas as many families plan their festivities around the TV schedule. Repeats of 70s Xmas Specials still draw a large audience.

null,false,MrFlabulous,null,null,null,"Many years ago a friend of mine noted that Forest were a 2nd tier side that had punched above its weight for a few years, then returned to where it belonged. Maybe we have unrealistic expectations. Certainly in the 60's and early 70's Forest were similarly haphazard until... well, *you know who*.

So maybe this kind of thing is ingrained into the club. Managers come and go but the bizarre, oft-hilarious ways we find of cocking up happen regardless.

If Psycho goes that would say more about Fawaz than the manager. And we still wouldn't get any better. I think the key is stability. We haven't really gone for much more than a season without someone swinging the axe for so long. Not since Paul Hart have I felt that we had a decent, stable set up. Even Billy's first stint seemed on edge, mainly because of his insane ranting.

I felt that O'Driscoll was excellent and deserved to stay for a couple of years at least. I felt that Cotterill (who in truth reminds me of Karl Urban) was OK and could have done with a longer stint. But Fawaz seems to have no patience. I didn't feel that Doughty had patience either, for all his self-professed love for the club he certainly didn't love many of the managers.

I do feel that Pearce's tactical nous is poor, and that he keeps on picking the wrong players. I know that our options are limited at the moment but I honestly never want to see Wilson on the field ever again. But rather than sack him it would probably serve better to have a new director of football, a David Pleat type (though not Pleat himself) who can advise and analyse.

While this is certainly a fantastic squad it does seem like too many players are basically phoning it in. Burke, Wilson, Lascelles just don't seem to want to be there. Mancienne is a fine player but I don't think he's a good captain. Oh, how we need Reidy back. How we need Cohen. Either one of them would be able to take charge on the field and make the side work. Even better if Reid could strangle Wilson with Lascelles' entrails. Fuck Wilson.

We need to be patient with Pearce, tolerate his mistakes and allow him to develop. Fawaz must do the same, because without a decent period of stability we can never expect to achieve anything.

I also think that Martinez uses him as Guardiola sometimes uses Lahm, where Lahm would go deeper and cover for Alaba or Boateng who will advance. In Besics case he has had to cover for Baines and Jagielka. 

The only times Besic has been offensive is when he has played with Barry and that as well is quite a handfull of times, and it hasn't worked just because A: he is not used to the high pacing so he gets closed down fast, resulting into a long pass to Coleman(or him losing the ball) or B: he moves forward, usually to the edge in a way to stretch the defence(since he can actually cross the ball quite well), sadly none of the players has used that opportunity and most of the balls goes to a middle who is so packed that Lukaku doesn't get the ball where he should get it to do something.


The tackles beeing rash is something I agree of though. He can be a little careless but that for me is his charm. A fearless defender is a good thing to have and in the last game you could actually see that the player he ""murdered"" on the field was quite scared of him and usually just tried to pass the ball off before Besic came closer to him although he knew that Besic already was booked for the foul against him. That for me is respect.

You have to remember that he is still young and although he makes misstakes it is even worse when Barry or Distin who has years of experience in the league does the same ones.

Cities and large towns normally have lit decorations in the main shopping areas, which are usually turned on by some celebrity (how famous they are depends on the place) in the first half of November. In the larger cities some shops and department stores have Christmas themed window dressing, which are unveiled around the same time the lights are switched on. Large stores and shopping centres usually have a Father Christmas that kids pay to see and tell him what they want for Christmas, followed by one of Santa's elves giving them a small present. The closer you get to Christmas the busier shopping areas get and Christmas eve can be horrendous. Usually hardly any shops or restaurants are opened on Christmas day itself and many places are like a ghost town with no one about. Boxing day is a traditional start of the sales and people have been known to camp outside some shops to get a bargain.

The majority of homes have a decorated tree which is put up anytime between the beginning of December and Christmas eve. The decorations usually consist of baubles and winter/Christmas themed ornaments, plus fairy lights. Often you see lights either hanging in windows or on the outside of homes. It is considered bad luck to have decorations up after the 6th January.

When I was young my parents used to visit family on Christmas eve and have a chat and a drink. If you're more religious then you may attend a carol service. The BBC also broadcast a service from King's College, Cambridge. The majority of infant and junior schools put on a nativity play (held the week or so before schools break up), where children get to play humans or the animals. There's also a small choir that sing carols. 

Presents are opened on Christmas day morning and dinner is eaten early/mid afternoon. Dinner usually consists of turkey, stuffing, roast potatoes, veg, pigs in blankets, some sort of sauce and gravy, followed by Christmas pudding. Where the meals are so big there is a tendency to fall asleep after. During dinner crackers get pulled, the winner gets a paper crown, a small prize and a terrible joke. At 3pm the Queen makes a speech on how the year has been and how she hopes the new year will be. In the late afternoon we may have left over turkey sandwiches. Many families play board games after dinner, which can result in a lot of arguing. 

The day after Christmas is boxing day. It is thought that it got its name from people giving their staff a Christmas gift as a thank you for their hard work. My parents still refer to giving people like the postman or newspaper boy a small tip a Christmas box. What people eat on this day is down to family tradition. Mine was eating cold meats with mashed potato and pickles. 

On the television the main channels show family friendly films, such as a Disney one or Wallace and Grommit. Running up to Christmas you'll also see A Christmas Carol film or one based on the novel, such as Scrooged. Ghost stories are also popular this time of the year. 

Popular food eaten are mince pies, Christmas cake (an iced fruit cake), a Yule log cake which is a Swiss roll coved in either chocolate or chocolate flavoured buttercream, brandy butter and of course mulled wine. 

Many businesses hold a Christmas party for their workers where people get horrendously drunk and do very silly things.

Hope this helps.

Depends very much on the area. What is generally true is that in nicer areas house values are very high in comparison to yield on rental income. In the posh areas of my town a 1 bed flat will cost ~175k upwards, but will only rent for £700/mo. That's less than a 5% gross yield. In these areas you get first time buyers complaining that they are ""stuck renting"", because it is cheaper to rent than buy.

However in poorer areas the opposite is true. I brought a 1 bed flat recently for 60k. I put another 4k into it, and now rent it for £550/month. That's over 10% gross yield. In these areas not many people want to buy.

This is the economy that I'm trying to explain to the likes of u/vzzzbux .

it sucks cash out of the lowest level of the economy and sends it to a high one. which is bad for the economy as a whole.

I guess because for the most part what we have works well.

I'd argue that we play more typical full backs under Monk, rather than wing backs. One of Monks big changes this season was a more organized defense where sometimes Rangel and Taylor hold back to provide the relief option on the wing. Sure it comes at a cost of less overlapping, but this is typically countered by Sigurdsson coming across and playing 1-2s behind the defense.

One of our huge weaknesses is crosses into the box/defending in the air. If we can stop or even delay the cross from coming in from wide positions we would be better for it. Having two wide players allows us to double up on the outside and is why I would be against a back 3 with wing backs.

We certainly get to see the Daleks themselves (outside the travel machines) in the fourth Doctor *Genesis of the Daleks*, where they seem to be rather smaller than those shown later on - although I assume that those ones were not not fully grown.

I'm really not sure whether we see one before that properly though. The thing that Ian pulls out of the casing in the First Doctor tale *The Daleks* is larger (although it doesn't seem quite human sized), but is hidden under the cloak.  

I have a feeling that we see a random tentacle or pulp of some kind coming from a destroyed travel machine sometime in the Third Doctor era, but I couldn't say exactly when.  

Not only does Ian fit into the Travel Machine in the original story, but the Doctor hides in one in *The Space Museum*, of course.

null,false,somethingdifferent34,null,null,null,"&gt;The problem here is that landlords effectively have it both ways. They set rents that prevent people from saving a deposit, because they've helped create a shortage on the other side through BTL which increases rental demand and therefore the rents they can get away with (especially in London). Since people can't save, they have no chance of buying, which means continuing to rent. Seems rather cyclical.

Again: You fundamentally misunderstand how this (any?) market works. As a landlord, I don't get to ""set"" the price my property is rented for, just as I don't get to set the price I paid for the property in the first place. In *both* cases, the price is set by market demand. 

Hence, if an area is profitable for BTL investors, it is PRECISELY BECAUSE there are lots of people who want to rent in that area. There are many areas where BTL investment isn't profitable, and this is because most people living in that area want to buy not rent.

Here is a real-life example from my area I wrote to someone else earlier:
""What is generally true is that in nicer areas house values are very high in comparison to yield on rental income. In the posh areas of my town a 1 bed flat will cost ~175k upwards, but will only rent for £700/mo. That's less than a 5% gross yield. In these areas you get first time buyers complaining that they are ""stuck renting"", because it is cheaper to rent than buy.
However in poorer areas the opposite is true. I brought a 1 bed flat recently for 60k. I put another 4k into it, and now rent it for £550/month. That's over 10% gross yield. In these areas not many people want to buy.""",null,0,null,1420373888,null,0,false,0,cne1s9e,null,t3_2r7vgl,null,t1_cne1s9e,null,t1_cndgi39,null,null,null,1425066550,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

 * Being sent on a training course that conflicted with his sign-on times.  JC wouldn't re-arrange his sign-on and the training course reported him for leaving early to attend his sign-on.

-----

&gt; To start, is the above thinking deluded?

Not really, but do check the numbers + go speak to a mortgage broker or a bank to get some firm numbers on your monthly repayments. Find out how the rent is worked out. Usually the housing association takes out a loan to buy the remaining share of the property and your rent is the interest on the loan. They'll also throw on top of that service charge and ground rent which usually is around £150 or more on a new build.

Don't forget to factor 'moving costs' such as solicitors (you'll have to pay for your own + the housing assoc's), stamp duty, surveyors &amp; mortgage fees. You'll have to factor these costs in each time you staircase too.

&gt; Are Share to Buy properties overpriced due to the obvious financial benefits.

From my experience they tend to be below the market - they get surveyors to value the property rather than estate agents. Have a look on Zoopla and get a feel for the prices in that area.

They also tend to be lower spec than the rest of the properties in the development but that depends on the developer.

&gt; Should I try and buy the largest % possible or minimise LTV?

This actually depends on your long term plans. Do you plan to staircase to 100% or sell on your share after?

If staircasing to 100% then get as much as you can early on as the value of the rest of the property will likely go up and staircasing will be more expensive.

Assuming you opt for a capital repayment mortgage then after several years you'll have made a good dent into your capital and your share of the property which'll help with further staircasing. If you're confident your job is safe and career is going well then maybe even stretch a little outside of your comfort zone (this is a gamble and you'll need a lot of safety nets and contingency if you plan on doing this).

If you plan on selling your share on then it'd be wiser to stick to the lower %age as you'll have a bigger pool of potential buyers when you come to sell. I know people who have done this and gone with an interest only mortgage as well and the rest of their money goes into an ISA.

&gt; How hard are they to sell?

The housing association will look for another a buyer for 3 or so months (I can't remember but I'm sure you can look that up) and if they don't find anyone then it goes to the open market - like the ones you find on property websites.

&gt; Is a 2-bed a better investment than a 1-bed?

Again, depends on your long term plans. If you plan on staircasing to 100% then switch it to a buy-to-let mortgage to rent out the property whilst you move out to the sticks and start a family then the 1-bed is probably the easier option.

-----

Hope that helps. Like I said I've been through the process and so have a few of my friends and colleagues so if you have any further questions just ask.

Also, bloody hell @ those property prices! Like /u/Caprylate mentioned you might want to look at other parts of London. I recently staircased the rest of my 2-bed 2-bath flat in E14 which was valued at £335k just under a year ago.

null,false,TheOldBean,null,null,null,"I think he's a great man manager and the type of bloke that gets full commitment from a lot of players and doesn't take any shit from players with ego's and defensively, he's great.

However, imo one of the reasons he will always be a mid-table manager is because he is absolutely not tactically aware (especially in an attacking sense).

He'll go on these runs of form that give the impression that  he's a genius but when you actually look at some of his tactical footballing decisions they are piss poor.

Remember when we lost all our strikers last season and he was forced to play a sort of Barca-style false 9? We won a bunch of games and Morrison destroyed Spurs. He looked like a genius but that formation and style was completely forced upon him. What did he do once teams started to realise what we were gonna do? Nothing. He didnt change the formation for ages and teams wised-up and our form plummeted. Then it was back to the his classic style of big strikers.

This season Nolan getting injured was an absolute blessing (we looked dire in our first game). It forced Sam to change our formation and play someone with a bit more attacking and athletic ability. (coupled with the requested attacking changes from the board). Our form has since been amazing this season. However.. teams have now wised up a bit to our threat and coupled with Nolan's return to the team (albeit slightly forced due to injuries) our form has dropped off. We still look much betetr than last season I admit I just don't think Sam will be able to ""out-tactic"" the better teams/managers in the foreseeable future to get us up the league for any extended period of time. 

Sam's the manager you get when you don't want to get relegated. I'm personally not sure if he's the man you look for when you want to aim higher. He did get 6th with Bolton though so what do I know.

**Tl:DR: Sam's a great man-manager but he is far from tactically aware IMO.**
