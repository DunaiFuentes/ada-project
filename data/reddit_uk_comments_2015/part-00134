I have no idea. Either way the introduction of fibre tax massacred many thriving ISPs like SOHONET (Fibre-only provider to media clusters around the country) and others which provided extremely competitive services.

&gt;Social customs and laws on __drinking alcohol in public__ vary significantly around the world. ""Public"" in this context refers to outdoor spaces such as roads, sidewalks or parks, or in a moving vehicle. Drinking in bars, restaurants or stadiums, for example, is not generally considered to be ""in public"" even though those establishments are open to the general public. In some countries, such as India, the United States and in larger regions, such as the Muslim world, public drinking is almost universally condemned or outlawed, while in other countries, such as Portugal, Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Japan, public drinking and [public intoxication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_intoxication) is socially acceptable, although may not be entirely legal.

In the US they are still winning that fight. The US political system looks roughly like the British one in 1950s where less than 2% of people vote for anyone other than the big two.

In Britain that fight was lost at the last election and is confirmed in this one. It'll take a long time for all the effects of this to filter through.

What is a bit unexpected is where the break has finally come. The break is coming from the wings of the main party rather than the centre ground. So nationalists abandon Labour for favouring a handful of swing voters in England. The Eurosceptics split from the Tories for the same reason.

I also anticipate this country is heading towards a more blatant dictatorship model so I would say your analysis looks correct and illuminating to me within the prism of imagining that we live in a democracy in which the people's interests are served. 

To me it seems that by participating in the system the general public does not understand that they are only given the chance to vote for more or less the same thing. Maybe you don't think that's even a point of view worth noticing. 

So to me it wouldn't take much to persuade the public to accept a one party state with a couple of minor parties to jump up and down in the margins to give the appearance of plurality. (EDIT: The denialism abot NHS is a proof, to my eyes)

So, while I agree that the public don't fall in to two camps, to all intents and purposes there are only two contenders, or there have been up until now. 

If I'm following the story right, the likelihood of coalition is very high this time again. But the difference between all the parrties is so small, to my eyes, that I feel the public isn't getting a choice and you're all sucked up in debating the difference between Cod and Chips and Haddock and Chips and no one is allowed to talk about Sushi or Chicken Vindaloo. Anyone who point out these other cuisines is called a maniac and told that the fact that there is a Fish Cake In A Bun party proves there is diversity of choice and people who want to talk about Tom Yum soup should have a tin foil hat or some such. 

Sorry if that's a bit long winded and I'm interested in why we will never see 51/49% elections?

To answer two posts at once: I come from a very poor background and I had to pay for my studies since I started high-school. It took me a while to get through graduate studies, and things only started picking up with postgraduate education, when I was paid and I could finally focus on my education for the first time in my life. I got out of postgraduate school only one year ago.
Combining all of this, I have no inheritance, no savings and, of course, no equity watsoever. Still, after all the sacrifices I made I got this job and this salary: because this salary is high for UK standards, I did not expect to have to go live in an awful place. I expect this to happen to people working for minimum wage jobs. Bottom housing ladder for bottom income jobs, right? Apparently not.

Rhetoric. 

&gt;  We are are expecting too much from our staff and players 

Let me then just say that may be there are not good enough and need replacing? If FSG say that top 4 consistently is the aim, then that will be the aim. If Rodgers cannot achieve it, so be it.

&gt; KEY POINTS
* More money spent on transfers during FSG's 3-year tenure that at any comparable three-year point in the club's entire history. 

&gt;* FSG spent 26% more on transfers than H+G did in their first three years. 

&gt;* FSG's Â£109.5m net spend is higher than any three-year net spend figure during Rafa Benitez's reign.

&gt;* FSG's average net spend per year = Â£39.6m. Rafa Benitez's average net spend in first 3 years = Â£16m.. FSG have basically doubled the club's net spend.

&gt;* FSG have already spent 78% of Rafa Benitez's entire 6-year Â£289m gross spend total. If they continue spending at this rate over the next three years, total gross spending will reach Â£456m.

There are loads different factors that people use to cost Trident depending how you perceive a cost. Even the government changes its estimation upward every few months.  

Take car ownership for example.  You buy a car for a grand, but after a year you find that your motoring expenses have gone up 3 times the purchase price because you have to maintain it, park it, put fuel in it and so on.  Which is the true price of owning a car?  Is it worth owning when compared to public transport?  Can you afford to own one at all?

When all that is said and done, what ever it is, Trident IS expensive.  Its expensive insurance.  Yes the governments first duty of the realm is to protect the realm, but, using a more basic analogy,  if your sick and can't afford to eat - what is the point of having expensive contents insurance on your home when your priorities should lie else where?

Tips for it (from my experience):

* **The bike goes where you are looking.** Under no circumstance look at what you don't want to go. If you look at the cone - terrified you will clip it - you will indeed clip it. If you look where you want to go - inbetween the cones - you won't. Even if you're going slow. Your natural balance will move the bike over there. If you practice that in training, when it comes to Mod1/Mod2 it will be like second nature. If you've been on a 125 for 2 years you probably already have this nailed tbh.
* **If you feel yourself loosing balance, let the clutch out!** Keep the bike moving, keep the clutch engaged and keep the engine pulling you forward. The moment the engine disengages and you coast, you will begin to loose the ability to keep balance. It's weird I know, but this cracked the slow ride exercises for me.
* **Don't try and slow ride when it's not necessary**. I have a habit of trying not to stop at red lights. If theres a queue in front of me and there is no or light traffic behind me, I will try and keep the bike in first and balance hoping that the lights will turn green. Stops me putting my foot down and improves my ability to balance at low speeds - opportune practice etc etc. *Don't do this on the test*. Do a positive, controlled stop and place your left foot firmly on the ground. There's no point wobbling about trying to keep it in first on the exam - the examiner won't be impressed and it doesn't showcase any skill at that stage.
* **If you're in the wrong lane, stay in it.** No faults for going the wrong way - you're not being examined on your ability to follow instructions, you're being examined on your safety on a motorbike. If he says go straight on at the roundabout and you go left, then just go left. No drama. I knew a guy who went left at every roundabout even though the examiner said otherwise. He got 1 minor and 0 major faults. Don't do this, but if you fuck up the lane choice then just go with it.
* **Balance the bike**. Don't try and man-handle a 500/600cc around, it won't work, especially if you've never had experience with one before. Get comfortable riding the bike very slow and how to balance properly. It will make all maneuvers much easier as well as making the road ride much more straightforward.
* **Take your time**. There is no timed element for either Mod1 or Mod2. If you want to take the manual maneuvering exercises (bay park) slowly, that is fine. They can't even give you a fault for that.

Good luck dude - take it slowly and be confident and you will nail it.

The jump for me was mainly to do with the weight of my 600 and the power it has.

And two in the basement. This was one Georgian style house, and it was awful inside. Infested with rats (unbeknownst to us before moving in), horrifically badly insulated,carpets filthy, kitchen dilapidated: it really looked like a slum. The landlord was raking it in. The thing is, even our maintenance loans didn't cover the rent - you need to supplement it with your own income.

We're talking a massive upheaval that would have knock on effects for *all* of the surrounding ecosystems, without mentioning the rare invertebrates that live within the ecosystem in question.

I appreciate how ecology-based arguments sound to people who haven't studied ecology, but balanced ecologies are literally the reason we can exist to extract resources and use them. We don't live outside of the biosphere, interacting with it only to extract resources or leisure.

Global ecosystems are very interconnected, but at a more local level, the functional species (so not necessarily a particular species, but any species performing a particular role or providing an ecosystem service) are *essential* to the behaviour of that ecosystem. When we lose biodiversity, and when we damage ecosystems, what we're actually doing is removing the capability of ecosystems to function properly.

I'm very much on the side of ""humans are the most important consideration""; that's why I believe in sustainability, conservation and ecologically rational decision making.

But there are other renewable projects which don't disturb ecosystems too much. The Severn Barrage wouldn't be one of those, but there's a proposal floating around somewhere to build an artificial tidal lagoon (which would provide energy and could also be used for watersports and other touristy stuff) in Cardiff Bay that would provide a lot of energy.

The problem is that governments and other organisations don't want to do the things that would really help, but keep trying to do other things which are more politically expedient, cheaper, or just faster--even if the actual ecologists are saying, ""no, don't do that, do this instead"".",null,0,null,1428661778,null,0,false,0,cq7lcqo,null,t3_320r8z,null,t1_cq7lcqo,null,t1_cq7l3p2,null,null,null,1432307096,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

We need 9 More. I think we will beat either United Or Liverpool at home, so thats 6 points we need.

I think we could get 4/5 points from Leicester/West Brom/QPR Treble , lets say 4. So We need 2 from our remaining games. If we draw with United thats 1, and if we draw with Arsenal thats 2.

To Summarise: If we lose to Arsenal and they win all their games, we need to win 3/4 Home games with the other being a draw, thats 10 points, Then Win once, draw once and lose once against QPR, Leicester and West Brom.

If we draw against Arsenal, They could only get 19 points, which would mean we would only need 13 points, and of course, 1 of those points would come against Arsenal , so thats 12 points.

For a Sovereign Wealth Fund btw, it won't really generate enough money to create an appreciable fund for an economy our size. It works for Norway because they're tiny: the current fund is around Â£500Bn after 25 years. The UK Government is spending around Â£750Bn this year alone. Their whole fund wouldn't even cover us for a single year's spending.

I fully support notions of trying to channel the revenue into worthy projects rather than just throwing it into the pile of routine spending, but saving it up for ten years or whatever won't really give us a lot of money in relation to what we routinely spend.

I'd rather see it spent on important projects that will contribute to the country for a long time, like infrastructure investment or schemes to get people to put solar panels on their roofs or something.

Edit here to clarify a bit:

You cannot simply turn up to a gun club and pay a one time fee to shoot some rifles. This is illegal. The way to get into rifle shooting (even if you just want to try it once to see if you think it's fun) is to find a club that has available membership. You then arrange a time to come and be briefed for safety, range rules, etc. You sign some forms that go to the police and Home Office, then you become a probationary member. Then you're allowed to shoot there, using club rifles (almost all clubs have an armoury with some guns that belong to the club, for probs to use).

If you try it once, and don't like it, you are under no obligation to carry on attending. If you do like it, you can now keep coming at the regular times, and shoot with club guns. You will most likely always need to be accompanied by a club officer when you go to shoot, since you aren't yet a member.

When your probation finishes (most clubs it's 6 months, some shorter, some longer) you can apply for full membership, and unless you've not been coming much, and/or been a total dick, you will be granted membership. Then you can come and go as you please, apply to join the committee, and apply for a Firearms Certificate to allow you to buy your own guns to keep and maintain at home.

""But fuzzy,"" I hear you say, ""I went clay shooting a few times and never had to go through this stuff"". Yes, shotguns (as long as they're a double barrel, or have a mag  capacity of only 2 rounds) are under different legal jurisdiction. Shotguns can be rented, loaned and used as long as you are in the presence of the owner, and shooting over land that has the proper insurance. This is how clay shoots operate.

If anyone fancies a clay shoot (and to have a go on some pump and semi-auto shotguns) I'd be happy to meet up with them at a clay grounds in Bristol.

For rifles, you will have to try around the clubs. Another North Bristol based club is Invicta, I dunno if they're taking members at the moment, you can give it a go.",null,0,null,1428663637,null,0,1428684435,0,cq7ltcy,null,t3_31zf54,null,t1_cq7ltcy,null,t1_cq71k1j,null,null,null,1432307314,null,3,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,3,null

We can try to change it as a member state in the same way a citizen campaigns to effect national law change, but we cannot unilaterally decide to stop the tax and disobey EU law. Similar to how you couldn't decide to stop paying tax because it's unjust or murder Boris Johnson because you think he's unjust.

This is the crux of what I was arguing in /r/soccer during the summer. Here was a club with ambition trying to breach the top 4, yet the players chose the easy route to be at best rotation players in the CL. My argument was that that reflects their lack of ambition more than Southampton's, yet I was constantly backhanded with the usual 'your owners are asset stripping you and you have no ambition, the players have every right to screw you over' rhetoric.

I still believe that, and I expect i'll be reusing those arguments again in the summer, but here's one thing I learned last summer; players are taking a risk in coming/staying here for CL football. Think about. This club has no top 4 history, indisputably smaller than Chelsea, Arsenal etc, in short little prestige. There is no guarantee Schneiderlin will ever achieve his dream of playing in the CL by staying with us. He *can* guarantee that by moving to Chelsea. Did Lallana, Shaw, Lovren etc want to commit 2,3,4,5 years (a long time in a player's short career) to maybe get us top 4?

Rent *and* house prices have done up in unison over the last 20-30 years, simply because we do not build enough houses in this country for our growing population. Build more houses and both rent and house prices will go back down again. It really is that simple.

It may be hard to appreciate, but BTL landlords actually help the poor, at the expense of the middle classes, by acting as a natural equalizer between the price to buy and the price to rent. 

The poorest X% of the population will never be able to afford to buy a home, regardless of how much help the government gives. There are also many people who choose to rent for a variety of reasons. Without any kind of private landlords there would be far fewer property available to rent relative to the amount available to buy. This means the price to rent a property would be much higher relative to the price to buy, which would in turn penalize the poor and subsidize those rich enough to buy.

It works the other way too. A landlord buying a property to rent is interested (almost) exclusively in the yield he will obtain. So if the property costs Â£100k and he can obtain 10k/year rent, that's a 10% gross yield. The general rule of thumb is that a gross yield under 8% should be avoided, as due to the costs of running a property you could very well end up making less money that you can get in a normal savings account (for much more hassle), or even an outright loss.

So if an area has too many property available to rent and not enough available to buy, the price to rent an property will go down but the price to buy will go up. This will in turn cause landlords to sell, bringing down property prices and lowering the number of rental property on the market, which will in turn raise rental prices relative to house prices, and so the feedback loop continues.

There are other ways in which landlords make a positive contribution to the housing market too. Often the best rental investment is to buy a big old 5 bedroom house in an area and convert it into flats for rent. This improves the quality of housing stock in an area, as well as contributing to the stabilizing mechanism I described above.

If the bike is leaning to one side or the other, it will feel very heavy and will be very difficult to control with your body weight. If the bike is upright and the majority of its weight rest on the wheels, it will feel much much lighter. Place one hand on the left handlebar grip and one hand on the pillion grab rails, underneath the left hand one and take it slow and steady.

The weight of a big bike for manual handling will be a shock at first, but just remember to keep it upright as possible and it will be much easier. You should only have to stabilize it when its upright - you shouldn't wrestle to get it there or make it stay there.

This season has been a very very big lesson for everyone involved in running the club and I just hope our team can bounce back quickly.

Te way they see it, is that he was involved in an accident.
Even if it was not his fault, he is still considered more dangerous than someone who has never had an accident.
It won't affect him as much as you, but some effect will transfer to his next premium.

Most ""do gooders"" don't relise this when they start being ""honest"" and making claims.

Trust me the Insurance in England is just a scam. they will bank roll you at any given opportunity.
The Insurance companies are some of the oldest companies in England.

This is one of the reasons I don't agree with reorting minor incidents. If it can be sorted sensibly, then I don't see any reason to increase a premium over a head lamp for example.
Some countries in Europe, aren't interested n minor collisions, and claiming for a broken wing mirror is frown upon.
Howeve, their insurance typically is about Â£60 per year, and the idea s you only claim if it's a serious accident.

in some ways I think thats better. the problems come around when theres a dispute on who caused the minor damage.

Anyways, Thats europe, and it's irrelevant to your case.

Another thing also, is the insurance comanies have ""appointed"" mechanics. this is another scam
(insurance companies in England are not entirely regulated). in fact insurance companies are so old, they often have friends in the royal family or central government. but I'm rambling here....

One example, was when I knocked my front light out once.
the insurance ""investigator"" said I had caused Â£360 worth of damage.

the car was worth less than that and I fixed it myself for Â£2. it only needed a new light bulb!!!

The damage cost on my accident report said Â£1000 worth of damage. I have never understood that!
And when I questioned it, I ot a different answer eveyytime!

As soon as Tories were in power, EMA was reduced a lot and I think it was eventually scrapped. The school rebuilding scheme was also scrapped, I remember the headmaster of our college was pissed about it.

Anyway, here's it copy and pasted, no need to give DM any more hits than necessary, plus you avoid all their shit formatting with millions of photos:

&gt; Just over a decade ago Gianfranco Zola was voted the greatest Chelsea player of all time in a poll of the club's supporters.
This may seem a little premature, but as Eden Hazard prepares for to make his 100th Barclays Premier League appearance for Chelsea at QPR on Sunday, the little magician could have a rival in years to come.

&gt; Hazard is some player, one of the elite in English football with those dazzling runs and the sparkling feet that can open up the best defences in the league.

&gt; This season he has been imperious, full of movement and flexibility as Chelsea close in on a double of Capital One Cup and Premier League in Jose Mourinho's second season back at Stamford Bridge.

&gt; After Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Paris Saint-Germain in February at the Parc des Princes, Mourinho demanded more protection from referees for Hazard. Chelsea's dancing winger is a marked man.
The PFA young player of the year had been fouled nine times, with Laurent Blanc's team taking it in turns to nobble the Chelsea No 10 in the first leg of their Champions League second round tie.

&gt; He has scored some special goals, 17 so far with another nine assists, as Mourinho's team close in on a fourth Premier League title in the Abramovich era.

&gt; On Sunday, April 26 the PFA players' player of the year award could be his, joining a list of winners that includes Luis Suarez, Gareth Bale, Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Thierry Henry and his Chelsea team-mate John Terry in recent times.

&gt; He has grown to love English football, adapting to the demands of the Premier League and the numerous managers he has already played for since his move from Lille in 2012.
Roberto Di Matteo was still Chelsea's manager when Hazard tweeted that he was joining 'this season's Champions League winner' ahead of his Â£32million move from France.

&gt; He made an impressive start in the Premier League, assisting the opening goal for Chelsea in the 2-0 victory at Wigan and winning the penalty for Frank Lampard to convert at the DW Stadium.

&gt; Di Matteo loved him as a player and he went through a notable dip in form when the European Cup-winning coach was fired after the 4-1 defeat against Juventus in the Champions League.

&gt; A few months later he was sent off when he infamously wrestled with a ball-boy during Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final defeat against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium.

&gt; He finished the season with a Europa League medal after Chelsea's victory over Benfica the Amsterdam ArenA, but it is the arrival of Mourinho that has transformed his game.

&gt; Last season there was a period of frustration among Chelsea's first team players because they shared the view of the coach that they had signed a world class talent.
Despite his ability he was often one of the first to leave after training, heading home to his family - wife Natasha and their two young children, after a quick shower and lunch with his team-mates. Slowly he has bought into dressing room culture.

&gt; There is a ruthless streak about him these days and Mourinho, to his credit, drew it out of him after meeting Hazard's father, along with his lawyer, after Belgium's disappointing World Cup in Brazil.

&gt; Hazard has grown in stature since he was handed Juan Mata's old No 10 shirt, requesting the jersey after the winger left for Manchester United in January 2014.
The No 10 shirt is also the number of his hero Zinedine Zidane, the player a young Hazard idolised when he was making his way through Belgian football before his move to Lille.

&gt; In recent times he has been encouraged to drift across the front three positions, interchanging with Oscar (in the centre) and Willian (on the right) when it takes his fancy.

&gt; He is the focal point of Chelsea's attack, a willing outlet with a first touch that you can melt when he takes it on the instep of his right boot.

&gt; He has been scoring goals again, adding to his tally this season in recent weeks with strikes for club and country as the season hurtles towards the finish line.

&gt; At 24 he is maturing nicely, a humble man who impressed Chelsea's hierarchy during the complex negotiations over a new contract towards the end of last year.

&gt; He has never been responsible for the glut of stories linking him with a move back to France to play for Paris Saint-Germain and he consistently told the club that he was willing to remain at Stamford Bridge.
Hazard's contract talks were reminiscent of Gary Neville at Manchester United, leaving it with the club to determine the terms on his new five-year contract. Chelsea settled on Â£200,000 a week.

&gt; To those who know him, he speaks of trophies and a hunger to be remembered as a player who contributed to one of the most successful periods in Chelsea's history.

&gt; Given time, he could even be remembered as the very best. ",null,0,null,1428666444,null,0,false,0,cq7mlre,null,t3_323t5l,null,t1_cq7mlre,null,t3_323t5l,null,null,null,1432307685,null,8,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,8,null

The examples you give (gold, deregulation) *made sense at the time*. Any economists speaking out against it were in a significant minority. And if you honestly knew about it back then perhaps you would have taken that Â£30 / week and invested it in something that actually turned out to be a good thing to buy into. Gold, for example.

Crucially, banking deregulation was done after advice from think tanks like the Adam Smith Institute, noted for giving Thatcher most of her policies. Considering ""Nu"" Labour and Blair especially were thought to be carrying her torch it's hardly surprising that banking deregulation became a thing (first started by N. Lawson, Con, by the way).

All too often ""gold, banks, argh!"" is the argument used by armchair commentators and CiF monkeys. If they all bloody knew about it so far in advance why weren't they writing to Gord Broon to tell him not to do it? Why didn't they all somehow stop the global banking crisis (which wasn't actually caused by Labour, hence the use of the word ""global"") before it began? Because they speak from a position of hindsight, that's why.

To caveat this, yes there's some Tory's who want to privatise the NHS and some Labourites that want to nationalise everything but neither extreme has much traction in the mainstream.

After all, if it applies at the regional level, and people from the different regions of England can be said to be discrete ""races"", then why doesn't it apply at the town or village or even neighbourhood level? 

What I'm trying to get at here is that the idea of ""race"", when you examine it, becomes nonsensical. The proper term for describing the violence which happened in this story is, it seems to me, ""xenophobic"" or ""nationalistic"".

However, when you don't grow up in a football loving culture in which all your friends love football your understanding of football will be slightly lacking until you catch up. I love nfl, but do understand that Americans have a far better grasp of the sport. This means that you see opinions that would have been more common when we were teenagers and had a less good grasp of the workings of football.

An example of this is I saw a comment that criticised BR for not slating the players in the press. To me, that suggests you don't understand how the English press will grasp at anything slightly negative a manager will say. When BR isn't critical of the players to the media, it does not mean he isn't critical, but rather that PR is a part of his job. As such, what he says in interviews will not be a true reflection of what he feels, and that's pretty basic football knowledge, but knowledge you'd only acquire if you understood the British press.

There's honestly nothing wrong with jumping to this conclusion as it'd seem logical, but like nfl it's easy to jump to wrong conclusions if you haven't grown up in a culture that adores nfl.",null,0,null,1428668633,null,0,1428685141,0,cq7nbzh,null,t3_323t6m,null,t1_cq7nbzh,null,t1_cq7m62f,null,null,null,1432308029,null,16,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,16,null

The Office for National Statistics 2014 report you mention says ""the overall trend over the past decade has been a decrease in the rate suicide but with a slight increase over the last four years"".

He got laid off *twice* during her watch, the first time he was a union leader at TMC, made sure people were treated well then was the last out of the door with little to no redundacy package himself. Then he worked at British Telecom which... got privatised. He lost his job then had to reapply to get it back.

My mum wasn't working at the time, we couldn't afford a car and we lost both a hospital and two schools in the area. So yeah, from my point of view I've done OK in spite of things Thatcher did, not because of them.

I can tell you're probably about 15-20 years younger than me, which means you probably have no idea of what the role of a Trade Union actually is / was. It was never about bucking the system, as certain parts of the British media would have you believe. It was never to harm or hinder the economy or industry. It was about ensuring workers were treated fairly and preventing corporations from breaking the law.

I don't want to be condescending here but I think you need to learn a few more things.

&gt;Conservatives give us what is needed, regardless of protest.

Thatcher gave us poll tax, 3 million out of work, boom and bust, Black Monday. By the time she left office inflation rates were as high as they were when she first started in 1979.

Oh do not be such a dick.  I'm paraphrasing some famous quotation regarding statistics.  It's not as if I'd said it was such terrible work, I wouldn't be surprised if it had been made by a woman.  Pull your head out of your anus and discuss the actual subject matter.

&gt; come directly from the academic research conducted by the University of Bristol

I so nearly studied maths there!  Anyway, academic research is open to scrutiny.  Instead I've no idea what paper this is, what report it is, because the writer of that peace was too busy with their hyperlink fetish to actually include the direct source.  I've got the BBC version and the Guardian version but not the one they are talking about.

Onto the ONS.  

&gt;""the overall trend over the past decade has been a decrease in the rate suicide but with a slight increase over the last four years"".

Fair enough, but you can't jump from that to saying it proves that ""this trend"" (meaning the correlation of suicides and Conservative governments) has held true.  You can't say that when there was a jump in the 90s, and the rise in the last 4 years, started in 2008, that is to say, well before the election.  Or is it fear of Conservative governments.  Ooooh, let's look for correlation in opinion polls!

&gt; Fourthly, the Australian study does contain information regarding the strength of correlation.

So what?  This is UK, I think /u/Houndinne/ summed it up nicely with [his link](http://www.tylervigen.com/view_correlation?id=1597)

&gt;Is he a dick? Yes. But if we enforced that rule UK dota would have nobody in it. 

The scene is probably the friendliest it has been since I joined, we just had an amazing Lan and we've easily got the best eSports lan community in the UK.  We may lack in competitive players and teams right now but the onus is on the players to change that.

&gt;To attempt the make a relevant IHL without one of the best players is just madness.

null,false,scotty1987,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,null,"&gt;Animal Aid has campaigned for many years to ban the whip from racing in Britain. 

A campaign for banning the whip.

I suggest they learn what the whip is actually used for rather than spreading misinformation. The whip is used for control. The reason it is used more in the final furlong (which has been decreased dramatically over the last few years) is to halt the horse bolting. Adrenaline does stupid things and if it is not controlled, a horse can become unpredictable. Cdouple that with the stubborness of the animal, it is a necessary evil.

Horses are inante pack animals. The whip is not used to make them run.

&gt;The Grand National is a deliberately hazardous race. Since 2000, 24 horses have died on the Grand National course and, over the course of the three-day meeting, 40 horses have been killed at the three-day in that same period.

And that is still a slim number in the actual race related deaths of a horse compared to flat racing. But I suppose people don't view flat racing as cruel because it isn't publicised.

&gt;Those horses who do not make the grade may be slaughtered for meat.

That's it. Don't eat chicken or beef/steak again guys and girls! A hen that stops producing eggs is killed for the table. A cow that stop producing milk is slaughtered for meat. Let's all turn vegan and be do-gooders! Also, the horses are euthanized by injection. By law, you can not put that meat on the table or even give it to a dog.

He is an injury prone player, there's no denying that. 

Also, he was recently out for about 9 months with an ACL injury. Not confident if he'll continue to be as good as he used to be. 

He's British and has high wages. That means we'd have to spend a considerable amount on him. That's my major concern.

null,false,somethingdifferent34,null,null,null,"""speculative BTL landlords"" are no different to any other. The same yield rules I explained above apply. The only way these people can make a profit is if the yield is there - if the demand is there for rental property. The BTL landlords actually need a higher yield than cash buyers, because the bank lending them the money is charging 4% interest!

I'm not necessarily against more regulation of landlords, but it's a very complex subject and we need to be careful of unintended consequences. It's going to be very hard to increase regulation without seriously increasing the price of rent. 

For instance: A 5-10 year rental contract is incompatible with the terms of a BTL mortgage. This means that only landlords that can afford to buy cash can offer them. So if the law states that rental contracts up to 10 years must be offered, it will cause the number of landlords to drop dramatically, which will in turn increase rent dramatically.

Another (real) example is these new ""Selective Licensing"" schemes that have been put in place in poor areas of many cities to ensure a minimum property standard. The regulations are very sensible at first glance: Minimum of EPC grade E, must have certified electrics, must not have drafts or damp, landlords must not have a criminal record etc etc. Seems great, right? Well in my city it has caused lots of vacant buildings where landlords can't meet the regs without spending lots, and 12% yields for the landlords who can meet the regs. The renters are now paying almost the same price to live in a crap area that they would pay to live in a nice area of town. This in turn is causing increased deprivation in the areas, as the only people remaining are those with no choice but to do so.

The answer is simply to build more property. This solves all issues. If we build lots of property, there will be more property on the market available to rent, renting will become cheaper and nobody will be willing to pay for a shithole when there are plenty of nice flats about for reasonable money. The dodgy bastards renting horrible flats will either have to charge such a small amount that it's not economical, or bring their property up to standard.",null,0,null,1428673732,null,0,false,0,cq7pkq4,null,t3_31zmc8,null,t1_cq7pkq4,null,t1_cq7ovlf,null,null,null,1432309154,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

As far as our lineup goes if Yun is not available Clint Hill will likely feature at left back.  Hill puts in a shift and covers well at LB but against top opposition like Chelsea I'm afraid he could struggle.  We really need to get Yun back.  The next question is whether Dunne makes an immediate return to the starting XI.  I don't think Caulker has done enough wrong to lose his starting spot and I also believe that Chelsea would find a way to exploit two 34+ defenders.  On the right side Isla is an obvious lock.  Isla is competent at right back but against top opposition, as we saw with Lukaku, he will get exploited.  Everytime I talk about the right back position all I can think about is why did we sell Danny Simpson...

In the midfield, Sandro, Barton and Phillips are obvious.  Our only concern is left midfielder.  I say we start TraorÃ©.  He has proven defensive qualities as well as pace and proved a nuisance against Villa.  Both Kranjcar and Hoilett have started the position but neither have made it their own.  It is quite late in the season to be giving out opportunities at any position but if TraorÃ© can go on a run of good form and transform our left wing the same way Phillips has the right, then by all means give him the opportunity.

Interestingly, I feel like Ramsey has been purposely vague about which players are fit and which are not, in an attempt to throw off Mourinho and his strategy going into the game.

On the other hand, I can sympathise - when our son was taken seriously ill and ended up in SCBU, we got investigated three times, were held in a hospital for over a month after we should have gone home (during which our son got MRSA) and were told quite openly that our unborn child (that we'd only just found out existed) would be taken away...because the consultants hadn't heard of Alagille's Syndrome at Kings College Hospital (the, er, UK centre for Alagille's sufferers) - and at one point I told a consultant that if he didn't mind, I'd like to lock his children in my bathroom and he could have them back when I'd spoken to several other ignorant colleagues in a few weeks' time to decide what to do next instead of contacting to one of the many email addresses of knowledgeable doctors that we'd given them - irrational, but that's what we were driven to. All evidence we presented was ignored 'because it's from the internet' (silly us for consulting the BMJ website) - the full story is very long, but ultimately if we got angry then we must be beating our son, if we didn't then we obviously didn't care and must be neglectful. I dread to think what a similar family that didn't include two nurses (who also pointed out things like sharps canisters on the floor of the kids ward and algae-covered bath mats) would experience - the ward closed not long after we finally escaped. 

Bonus - we had to get a lawyer to force the hospital to release our son's case notes in order to do our own diagnosis, and even then we found that they'd doctored them to appear as if our son *had* received all his meds and fluids (when the untouched records of his vitals showed that he obviously hadn't, something the GMC forced them to acknowledge....eventually). When all the experts around you are more interested in finding a way to blame you and simply refuse to consider any other options regardless (he had seventeen X-Rays &amp; MRI scans, half of which were looking for broken bones which, of course, weren't broken), that does tend to lead to an outpouring of hatred.

Having to remain on alert every night for a number of weeks (the wife and I took it in turns) because students keep trying to practice taking blood from your infant (whom you're trying to keep calm to avoid further bleeds) will do that. We now take our son to Birmingham hospital, 150 miles away - I don't think any of us will ever step foot in Kings' College Hospital again (but on the plus side, they're a lot more knowledgeable about it now, fortunately) - our son, for his part, slowly got better and better and can now play Pink Floyd's High Hopes on the piano :-)

The only products that are VAT-exempt are those which were prior to joining the EU economic zone, they have been grand-fathered in.

From what has been reported in the media, it seems that he was in radiological remission (ie they couldn't see any residual tumour).  They would usually then irradiate the rest of the brain and spine to tackle any small deposits that can't be seen on the scan.  This has potential effects on intellect and development, so the parents wanted to avoid it in lieu of proton beam therapy which is more targeted.  However, in my limited understanding of the case this isn't the right kind of radiotherapy to choose.

This is already given to patients who will benefit from it (NHS sends people overseas) so Ashya was clearly not considered for it by the panel of expert oncologists.

Siting and location are important considerations for the community because it directly impacts the displacement of members, traffic patterns, the local economy, and job creation. For these reasons, cities will look for a site in run-down or abandoned areas. âStadium development in these broken neighborhoods can help to reduce crime; re-energize the local economy; create a more safe, livable environment; increase health of residents; and provide new connections between parts of the cityâ (Rizzo, 2008, p. 38).

Gentrification is often cited as the key problem to urban development of sporting venues. Development on this scale will undoubtedly bring an increase in the cost of living. Local governments can provide some alleviation to this increase. Ultimately though, âsome people will be âpriced outâ of the marketâ to achieve renewal (Rizzo, 2008, p. 41).

They allow certain authorised employers to bypass the rehabilitation of offenders act to get private data about criminal convictions which otherwise bans employers for asking employees about their criminal record. 

This means you cannot DBS check someone unless you are an employer authorised to request DBS checks and the job description of the employee is meets certain requirements. (there is a very basic very limited DBS check which is open to anyone to check anyone for any reason, but it is super limited and nothing like a real full or enhanced check). 

In practice, DBS checking of employees dealing with children is considered a basic precaution which all schools should be taking. So, if a school weren't to DBS check their staff then they risk being investigated for negligence in their child protection or even prosecuted if something were to happen,or if it turns out that an employee with special responsibility (such as a teacher)  was in fact banned from working with children. 
 
However, in certain circumstances, an employer could argue that DBS checking is unnecessary - such as no expected contact between an employee/contractor and children - or that they may allow an employee to start work pending a DBS check (I've worked in a children's hospital with an expired DBS, pending a new application - basically the CEO just wrote a letter to the head of HR saying that I am authorised to start work without DBS clearance pending the completion of the new check) .

null,false,terahurts,null,null,null,"Slightly different situation but my wife leases a car through Motability (they provide lease-hire cars for the disabled by taking some of their DLA/PIP entitlement).

**Pros:**

The only thing we need to budget for (apart from the monthly payments, which we don't see in any case) is fuel.  Insurance. servicing, tyres and repairs are included within the lease which is a massive plus as far as we are concerned.  We're paying ~Â£200 a month for a less-than-three-year-old car, we don't have to worry about stuff falling off it or it breaking down and not having spare cash to fix it or insure it etc.

**Cons:**

No modifications allowed, and the car is expected to go back in as close to showroom condition as possible (IIRC normal wear-and-tear is expected such as scuffs to the boot opening plus one or two 'minor faults' like cracked light glass or minor dings).

Limited mileage.  We're supposed to keep to less than 45000 miles over the term of the lease and apparently that's pretty generous.

It's a three year contract and under normal circumstances you can't hand the car back early - one of daughter's friends has a sister who's had a car sat on her drive for the past six months as she can't drive herself and has split up with her partner who could.

In our case the pros outweigh the cons; we'd have struggled to afford to buy a car with cash and being on benefits means that it's hard to get finance without paying 100000% APR.  The monthly repayments are in line with what we'd be paying (assuming we could get finance), insurance and road tax etc.  I've also outgrown the need to install go-faster goodies and loud stereos etc and our annual mileage is less than 8k a year.",null,0,null,1428676353,null,0,false,0,cq7qzzc,null,t3_3202f9,null,t1_cq7qzzc,null,t3_3202f9,null,null,null,1432309825,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

In truth actually this has the stink of something crooked about it - he bought 15% of a $10billion market and then sold for $1? During the time he held the assets the value increased vastly.

You have some logic which identifies the carrier, mimics the network block screen (or in this case, a block screen used by Orange which is now defunct) and passes the phone number to someone who calls and then attempts to get information from the person which can be used to scam them. Makes sense, most people are embarrassed enough about porn and it wouldn't be hard to use a little social engineering to make them give up enough info to steal an identity or just money.

Seems like this sub loves an ""underdog"" I guess, nothing wrong with that, just seems wierd that we go through times where everything good about these players are upvoted and anything negative is downvoted. I'm all for supporting our players, I've often times argued for a player thats having a rough patch, its just that this sub seems to have some sort of a underperfoming player of the month that everyone is supposed to support, but its fine to complain about everyone else. 

Last couple of weeks with Sterlings contract situation, I've seen it a lot here that he isnt consistent enough to be worth 100k+ a week, and also seen a lot of comments that Coutinho is the one who should be asking for those kinds of wages, which seems wierd since the general opinion everywhere else usually is that Coutinho is the more inconsistant of the two. It's only natural that they are inconsistant the both of them by the way, thats how it usually is with young players, I'm not trying to complain about either one of them. 

There has been a lot of talk that we should sell Sterling, and on this sub most people it seems think that he should be easily replaceable, which most people I've discussed with other places thing is going to be really difficult. There has also been a fair amount of comments saying either Ibe or Markovic (mostly Ibe, but Markovic has been mentioned a couple of times) is going to be better than him anyways, which is possible of course, but Sterling has been a very important player for us both this season and last season, which I would say makes him a proven premier league player. Thats not something you could say about Ibe or Marko yet.

Most people here doesnt want us to play Euro league next year, which most people other places thinks will give the squad european experience, which we have showed we need this season. 

There's more but these are the topics I can think of off the top of my head right now, and all these are opinions, so nothing wrong with any of it, its just not the same opinions as outside this sub it seems to me.

In the scots referendum the cost of moving, building and opening a new trident ready HMNB in England was floated at the Â£100 billion. 
Then there is the capability gap during movement.
The prevention of the break up of the United kingdom by enemies both foreign and domestic has got to be part of our security services aims.

Then finally the lack of access to the oil reserves in Scotlands part of the North sea if the SNP were successful in breaking up the UK is another defence and political angle.

The oil reserves are a strategic asset that are valuable to the state. We can sell it, turn it into weapons and need domestic supplies to end reliance on rival regimes ie Russia.

What has worried Tories about the coming vote is that UKIP do have concentrations of support in particular constituencies, so instead of small support in many places like the Greens, they have strong support in defined regions.

The other point is that a huge number of people vote strategically in each constituency; so on one hand, the number of supporters for small parties is grossly undercounted in the election, and on the other hand the general left/right split is probably about right as people vote for 1 of the 2 strong parties in their area.

Although it is a new campaign, it will be interesting to see if there's a group effect from ""I'll Vote Green If You Do"", (http://illvotegreenifyoudo.com/) which is intended to make it easier for a constituency to elect an MP where they have not previously had so much support, by demonstrating that it wouldn't be a wasted vote. It's not the Most Unexceptional scheme ever, but when the Greens are the favourite protest party on the left, it could swing a few seats from the Lib Dems.

I'm pretty okay with a bit of cuntiness myself, as were but I'd worry about potential for off the pitch antics. 

As far as the transfer policy goes, I'm kinda torn. I think we need a 20 goal a season striker and I'm not convinced there's anyone under 24 that we can afford that could do that. Buying anyone from other leagues like Dybala, Mitrovic, or Depay we run the risk that they take a few months or more to adapt to a new league and can't contribute right away, which is really what we need with such a thin squad. The same is true for players over 26ish of course, but chances are they've moved around a bit more and are at least used to the changes a new league brings. 

Personal preference I don't think there's any strikers that would fit our playstyle under 24 worth splashing cash on, but that doesn't necessarily mean we should be looking at 30 year old journeymen either. I'd be up for an older player as long as they can contribute right away.

We always tend to look at the renovations as a way to pack more fans in on match day, but that isn't as easy as just building more seats.  The new stadium isn't to allow more current fans in on match day, it's to gentrify the area and make the club and area more palatable to the traveling fan.  

Why is Chelsea so popular amongst foreigners?  Because no one ever has to ask the question, is it safe in Chelsea at night.  It is an easy destination. 

If Tottenham is cleaned up, sanitized, and anesthetized; then it becomes more of a destination.  There is no question that it takes away from the allure of the club.  Tottenham remains one of the last, consistent top clubs that has an older stadium in a working class neighborhood.  

I'm an American and as a former Chicagoan, you absolutely cannot tell me that Wrigley field isn't a shit hole, but there is that allure, that tie to the past, that makes each game feel special.  Its out of an era that doesn't exist anymore.  

**BUT** I think this is the only way to continue to compete consistently.  You aren't just playing against foreign oil money, you're playing against clubs that have been made easier to digest for non-die hard fans.  A renovation doesn't do that.  A few more seats doesn't do that.  Creating a massive space ship in a gentrified neighborhood does that.

Yep, Australia has no race problems at all with Native aborigines, and America...are you really this stupid? I can't even rationalise the person who questions whether race relations in America are even close to acceptable compare to a UK paradigm.

&gt;UKIP are not anti immigration as a whole, just much more selective.

You mean how they are now? Except across Europe where everyone has freedom to move and work where they want, I can just as easily go be a Plumber in Poland as a Polish person can be a Plumber here. 

&gt; However I hate the 'Just shit on them and pretend your above them' approach so many people seem to have.

That stance is fine for Labour, the Lib Dems, The Conservatives, The Greens, The SNP, but when it comes to the UKIP if you can't understand that their whole mandate is based on racism, then you aren't paying attention, just like the Conservatives are about the rich keeping their money, the Greens about the environment, the SNP about Scotland. These all aren't inherently good or bad things, they are just opinions, IMO racism isn't an opinion, you are just a dick if you believe in it and people aren't voting on quantitative statistics of immigration, they are voting on their feelings, and there feelings are quite frankly just racist. 

Not all of them of course, as I previously said, a lot are just ignorant to what they are even voting for, if you are voting for the UKIP and don't actually want to leave Europe, you are doing voting wrong.

more money for ENIC

one of the few positives

&gt; It's a status symbol. Big clubs have big stadiums.

status symbols? this isnt the school playground

&gt; Atmosphere going down is just you're opinion, you cited Arsenal who have always been shit &amp; City, who shouldn't have moved as they didn't have the fan. We do have the fan base to accommodate, I don't see why it would be worse

Disagree, maine road had fantastic atmosphere on it days. 

&gt; You say the money from the stadium won't make a difference for the club, then why would ENIC spend 400 million on it?

more profit for them and inflates the selling price of the club. Levy has always said the club would be sold at any time, for the right price

the number of jobs lots through the shops and businesses shut down wont be matched by the jobs created. also most local people cant afford to go.

I think both FSG and Rodgers recognized, or at least realized partway through, that this season was going to be rough. The most important thing to our success is our system. We have to perfect the system or we're going to get smashed. If we're too slow/uncoordinated on the press, then we'll concede. If our possession game, and movement isn't good enough up front, then we'll never score. 

Problem is we brought in a whole load of youth from abroad that needed time to settle, adjust, and learn the system. Lallana was about the only product I expected to slot right in, and he's been injured seemingly endlessly. Then we also experimented on some players to see if they could fit in and contribute (Balo, Lambert, Lovren) but they've all had issues with not learning the system (Balo), not being good enough (Lovren), or just losing his legs (Lambert).

null,false,AnxiousMo-Fo,,Labour | Check out /r/LabourUK!,null,"I disagree. One of the Tories' main attack lines is that Ed would sell the rest of Britain out to the SNP, so by guaranteeing to prevent the thing the SNP would most like to see, Ed deflects that attack. Also, consider that Sturgeon was booed at a debate for not ruling out another referendum and that not all SNP voters actually want independence and/or another referendum, and this doesn't seem like such a bad idea. Certainly, since all the pro-independence former-Labour voters can be assumed to have already defected, they're not going to lose much in the way of pro-independence lefties.

There have also been polls by YouGov suggesting that those planning to vote SNP are least likely to change their minds of all voters. Crucially, though, the same polls suggest that 50% of Tory and Lib Dem voters are already thinking of voting Labour to keep the SNP out.

Because of that, the best way for Labour to win more support is to get votes from unionists of all parties, which is why Labour are bellowing out the line about how full fiscal autonomy will cost a fortune: Lib Dem and Tory voters are most concerned about the economy, the deficit, and the tax rises that full fiscal autonomy would absolutely have to involve, so this line should appeal to them. Since full fiscal autonomy would also involve cuts to public services, Labour will be hoping they might just get a few wavering working-class and other left votes, although I suspect that group's mostly a lost cause and Labour know it (see above re: SNP-voter certainty).

Labour will also be hoping that pointing out that Scotland can't actually afford to do what the SNP wants will help discredit the SNP and shore-up Labour's poor economic credentials with all voters, including those south of the border. This seems calculated mainly to appeal to centrists who still buy the 'Labour crashed the economy' line but are somewhat willing to be convinced.

Given all that, I actually think this is pretty smart: It shows Labour won't bow to SNP demands, thus reassuring those who are worried by that prospect, and posits Labour as the defenders of the union, appealling to unionists everywhere.",null,0,null,1428681178,null,0,1428682113,0,cq7u0w9,null,t3_324h9q,null,t1_cq7u0w9,null,t1_cq7s6ph,null,null,null,1432312642,null,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3,null

I was talking with regards to immigration. Just a quick fyi, the president of America is black. 

&gt;You mean how they are now? Except across Europe where everyone has freedom to move and work where they want, I can just as easily go be a Plumber in Poland as a Polish person can be a Plumber here.

Its a valid, non-racist policy to not want that. 

&gt;That stance is fine for Labour, the Lib Dems, The Conservatives, The Greens, The SNP, but when it comes to the UKIP if you can't understand that their whole mandate is based on racism, then you aren't paying attention, just like the Conservatives are about the rich keeping their money, the Greens about the environment, the SNP about Scotland. These all aren't inherently good or bad things, they are just opinions, IMO racism isn't an opinion, you are just a dick if you believe in it and people aren't voting on quantitative statistics of immigration, they are voting on their feelings, and there feelings are quite frankly just racist.
Not all of them of course, as I previously said, a lot are just ignorant to what they are even voting for, if you are voting for the UKIP and don't actually want to leave Europe, you are doing voting wrong.

Its amazing you managed to write all that without being able to provide any evidence at all to back up your argument. If you are going to call a party racist, you need to provide evidence of that - ideally through their policies that you describe as 'Wholly based on racism'.

Also, you do know that UKIP's actual flagship policy is removal from the EU? The EU is a massive majority of Caucasian. It doesn't even make sense to call them racist. Your argument is already non-existent, but at least use the right words (xenophobic)

In this case, where we assume that everyone has their current vote as first choice, and the Lib Dems as second choice:

Eliminate Socialist Labour, their 148 votes go to the Lib Dem:

Conservative	|	12,275	|	23.7%
Liberal Democrat	|	8,255	|	16.0%

Still nobody above 50%, so eliminate the Lib Dems (and as nobody had a third choice, and the Lib Dem votes didn't have second choices, they simply vanish):

Green	|	16,238	|	37.3%
Labour	|	14,986	|	34.5%
Conservative	|	12,275	|	28.2%

Nobody over 50%, so eliminate the Conservatives; their second-choice candidate is already gone, so those votes also disappear:

Party	|	Votes	|	Percentage
----	|	----	|	----
Green	|	16,238	|	52.0%
Labour	|	14,986	|	48.0%

They also need to pay a royalty for every piece of music used. This would mount up to a massive overhead if the BBC made all content available.

The BBC also has a duty to maximise the benefit to the licence fee payers. It does this by licensing its content to other broadcasters and SVOD operators. Netflix isn't going to pay as much if the same content's already on iPlayer.

The BBC Charter directs it to nurture the commercial broadcast sector, and dumping such a massive catalogue into the market would seriously and adversely affect the wider market.

That being said, I'm not a fan of the grey/blackish tint to the pictures. Gives a vibe of that these people are historic, rustic, or outdated if you get what I mean (though some of are). Like our claim to fame is some what faded or fading out.

It's kind of contradictory to the general consensus that what we have right now is going to be dominate for years to come. A dynasty of excellence of sorts. We are the sole club that represents English football right now (hopefully in the future too). 

This banner, though very good, doesn't really reflect that.


Like if you look at /r/realmadrid, their banner is a reflection of their club. It's has a classy and ""bigger than life"" type feel to it.

Or even /r/juve where their banner reflects the Old Lady nickname. How they are the most classy, oldest, and most dominate club in the Italian game. Same goes with /r/acmilan.

Our banner needs to have bright and vibrant colors that do reflect the ""new generation"" if you will. I'm not the artsy type, but i'm sure you can think of more/better things to put there.

Also, I'd put Cech AND JT in there before putting in Cesc. I understand he is good, he's Arsenal's golden boy, he sells kits like it's crazy, etc. But he just came. He hasn't really done THAT much for us (in term of his career here). Let me know how you feel about this. Interested to hear why you may think it's ok to put him there. 

Diego Costa on the other hand i'm fine with. Mainly because he truly is the final piece we've been looking for. And his face pisses off a fuck ton of people lol.

I also do enjoy the pride of London part.

I'd guess it's a pretty safe bet that it's not funded, which means in the private sector it would be employers meeting the cost of the Big Society.  I'd say that you wouldn't be far off if you wanted to call that a tax.  I'm not opposed to large employers being obligated to put something into society over and above being employers, but it's an unusual idea coming from the party you'd expect to be anti-tax and pro-business.

If it were funded it'd likely be like SSP, which means what you'd be entitled to (and what you'd get from many employers) would be significantly less than your normal earnings.  Since most people don't so much in the way of income that they'd be keen to lose some this would lead to a low take-up.

American design with american pieces, we put them together and maintain them though apparently.

[NATO authority depends on who is the Supreme Allies Commander at NATO.  That role is always held by an american.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Allied_Commander#History)

So trident is US design and really an extension of US power that we pay for and could use if we suddenly needed it.  Don't get me wrong, it makes sense to use the same designs as they Yanks, they're likely good designs and why re-invent the ... thermonuclear MIRV submarine?  Plus we likely all get a discount by ordering in bulk.  And when it was basically the Warsaw Pact vs Nato, it made sense for it all to be under a single control and for the US (as the biggest ally) to control that.

But we should not kid ourselves that this is ""plucky british engineering"" or that we have ""a seat at the top table"".  We're an American appendige and have been since somewhere between 1900 and 1950.

What we have to ask is not ""how can we keep being a world super power"", that was a question for 1950.

What we have to ask is, where is our national interest best served:  tied to the Yanks and supporting their armed forced (both with trident and invading sandy places with them) or taking a more chilled approach.

I haven't used the train in a year or so but if you work &gt;3 days a week it's worth asking about a ""weekly season ticket""; these give unlimited journeys for the week between Severn Beach and Clifton for Â£6 or Severn Beach and Temple Meads for Â£9.  I'm not 100% they're still offering this but definitely worth enquiring about.

One of the only problems with Shire is that the Co-operative have a bit of a monopoly, we have no Tesco or anything else so they're notoriously expensive. Many residents (myself included) go to Cribbs Causeway or Aldi in Henbury to do a weekly shop.

There's a couple of decent pubs - I tend to steer clear of the Lifeboat but the George is alright (right opposite).  The Lamplighters has recently reopened and though slightly more expensive it's located right by the river with a park and playing field right next door.  Also Hope &amp; Anchor down towards Lawrence Weston is more popular with younger people on Friday and Saturday nights, probably due to the cheap pints!

Other people have said it's a bit dodgy - I see where they're coming from as it's kind of the ""buffer"" between Avonmouth/Lawrence Weston and the fancier parts (Sea Mills/Stoke Bishop/Clifton), however I've never had any trouble and I'm often out late at night coming home from the bus stop on the green or one of the pubs.

It could be that the goofiness just isn't for you. I know a lot of people who interpret the tone of the show as childish and find the whole thing quite jarring.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"Given the current student loans system here in the UK, you almost certainly should take the maximum loan available and not pay it off any more quickly than you have to. (This is generally a good rule of thumb - there might be exceptions later if you have a particularly high income, but you're certainly not there yet!) It's quite different to the situation in the US.

Have a look at the [I have Â£x, what should I do with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/wiki/lumpsuminvestment) link from the side-bar.

Broadly speaking, you only want to invest (buying funds/stocks/bonds/etc, rather than saving) money if you're planning to keep it invested for some time. It sounds like there's a decent chance that you might want it for a house deposit, a move or to help get you started in a new job shortly after graduating, so I would be inclined to keep it in cash (or very cash-like forms). Some of the best cash rates are from high interest current accounts, but you may not qualify for those as a student - but have a look around and see what's available (the Money Saving Expert site is a good place to start). If you're expecting to have a good income after graduation and to be using your ISA allowance then, it may be worth getting it all into ISAs as quickly as you can to take advantage of these years' ISA allowances, even if these have a lower interest rate. It might also or alternatively be worth getting started on a Help To Buy ISA when they become available - but the rules on this aren't quite clear yet.

There's no rush - you have until the end of March 2016 to use this year's ISA allowances if you do want to do that. Keep it somewhere safe, don't spend it on beer, and educate yourself about finances now :) I would seek to learn about:

null,false,dudethrowthataway,cnty-scotland,Temporarily Stateside,null,"I know you have good intentions and might think this isn't as difficult as it sounds, but it really is a huge engineering problem with almost undefinable cost. 

For starters, there are one or two accidental deaths on the tube every year. Most deaths on the tube are suicides, and while horrible, they aren't bringing the system to a complete standstill. At stations like Clapham North and Common, something clearly needs to be done because people are being forced onto the tracks by busy crowds, but as it stands, the platform is barely wide enough to fit people, let alone barriers. The answer might be something like regulated entrance to the platform from the station, as is generally seen on busy mornings.

With situations like this, it seems it could have happened *anywhere*. This is hopefully a freak accident and isn't limited to any particular platform or station. Putting in barriers at Stockwell alone wouldn't be the most logical reaction.

As a ton of other people have said, TFL do not have an unlimited budget. It sounds cold, and there are always people who say you can't put a price on human life, but you can. You can take a finite amount of money and spend it on certain things, and one of those options will have greater benefit and save more lives than the other. Are we evil for not spending money on the lesser of two options? No, we made a choice. We can't afford to do *everything*, so we have to spend our money wisely and efficiently for the highest 'return'.

Putting in barriers on a curved platform will require closing the platform (or line) for days or weeks, getting the materials down to the platform and setting up a safe workplace. It may require reducing the amount of space for pedestrians on the platform, or it may require widening the tunnel itself. The platform may need to be rebuilt. Additional infrastructure is required to operate the doors. Platforms are all different lengths and shapes, and so custom fittings would be necessary, hugely increasing the cost. Engineers cost money, materials cost money, systems cost money, labourers cost money, project managers cost money, architects cost money. The cost in New York was estimated at [$1m per station on a network with 448 stops](http://www.phillymag.com/news/2015/01/13/platform-screen-doors-septa-el-broad-steet-line-orange-blue/).

And that's just the practicality of installing it. With the station out of use, the strain on buses is intensely magnified. Have you ever tried going North from Clapham Common in the morning when the tube is closed? It's like something out of a disaster movie. Literally tens of thousands of people can be forced to use different modes of transport before 9am due to a line failure on the tube, and lord knows our transport infrastructure is constantly being pushed to its limits. There's very little room for overflow.

And long-term closures? They can grind high streets to a standstill for days as traffic tries to cope. Businesses can suffer, and people can't get to where they need to go. The cumulative cost on the economy is staggering. It's *far* greater than the cost of installing the platforms.

The second kind of blackout happens when not enough tickets are sold; the idea being that if you don't let people watch it on TV, they will have to go see it at the stadium (which is ridiculously dumb logic). Luckily, the NFL decided to stop this kind of blackout this year.

Amy's main trait was her energy and stubbornness (that stereotypical Scottish quality), and, to be honest, her selfishness (which is REFLECTED in her waiting for the Doctor and her relationship with Rory). 

The majority of the traits that are listed there are, once again, necessary for the plot: ""she is observant"" because she points out things that need to be addressed in the script, ""she is resourceful"" because she does tasks thrown at her by the Doctor (every companion is resourceful to some end, otherwise they wouldn't be the companion)... Clara is painted as the girl who is there to do whatever is needed. There aren't any undisputedly negative qualities about her, which sounds great on the surface but just proves to make her flat. She's the Mary Sue of Doctor Who.

Of course, it's a good practice for high risk employers to make sure their staff have DBS checks. If a care home boss allowed staff in without DBS checks, then the CQC would want to hear a bloody good excuse.  In extreme cases, the employer could be prosecuted for not DBS checking their staff, or for checking their staff and ignoring the checks. (It is a criminal offence for an employer to knowingly hire a ""barred"" person for certain jobs). 

It boils down to this, the *employer* requires the DBS check, although the government tells them employer that it is a good idea.

The point is that if the employer fails to make a DBS check, it's the employer's problem. The employer can, however, make it a contractual issue that the employee has a DBS check - in other words, they can refuse to hire you, if you won't get a check, or sack you on the spot, if you refuse to update your check. 

Payment for the DBS checks is the responsibility of the employee. Which strikes me as bloody stupid, because the employee cannot apply for a check - only the employer can apply. And yes, they are expensive - When I worked at a Kid's hospital, I also worked at the adult hospital on the other side of the road, and another hospital a little further away. Every 3 months, my job title would change. Every 3 months, I would need another 3 CRB checks @ Â£60 a pop. CRB/DBS checks are not even tax allowable, so I couldn't claim the tax back.

He's been a regular for the U21's this season and played almost every game I believe. I reckon it's time for him to go out on loan now and get some proper football under his belt, League 2 would be a good start for him next season. Hopefully we'll get to see him in a few pre-seasons too.

Inniss, Dymond, Kaikai, Boateng and Gray have all had loan spells under their belts now so should be looking to have a sniff of a bench or two - Boateng has been on the bench a couple of times now under Pardew.

It's really difficult to give youngsters a chance now in the first team in the premier league but Pardew seems to believe in young players unlike Warnock so that's a good sign.

Reise is technical and quick, creates a good amount of chances. Sometimes when I've seen him though there are times where he can seem a bit lost in games and a bit quiet but every attacker has those games once in a while.

If I had to put it down to something, I would say if you see David Miliband speak or interview - he sometimes appears as he now works for a charity - he comes across very strongly like Tony Blair. His mannerisms, his measured answers and so on. It is also well known that David Miliband was a blairite. Which I think the Unions found to be rather toxic.

To enforce my view, here is a piece where someone says largely the same thing in the telegraph - in 2014:

&gt;Your landlord has a right to reasonable access to carry out repairs. What âreasonable accessâ means depends on why your landlord needs to get access. For example, in an emergency, your landlord is entitled to immediate access to carry out any necessary work.

&gt;Your landlord also has a right to enter the property to inspect the state of repair or to empty a fuel slot meter, but they should always ask for your permission and should give you at least 24 hours notice.

&gt;If you are staying in lodgings where it is agreed that your landlord provides a room-cleaning service or where you share a room with other lodgers, your landlord can enter without permission.

&gt;Your landlord does not have a right to enter in any other circumstances unless they have a court order.

Notice that the landlord himself is restricted in when he can access the property, and can only really do so without notice if emergency  repairs are needed. Otherwise he must give notice of his intent to visit and/or ask permission.

Doesn't say shit about a wife, she may as well be Joe Nosey from the street.

Annoyingly many private landlords seem to be of the opinion that, because they own the property, that you just happen to be living in their house and paying them money and they can swan in and out like they would their own front door. That's not how it works and people should be aware of this.

I'd personally tell her politely, but firmly, that you don't appreciate the unnecessary intrusion and if her husband (or her on his behalf) wants to inspect the property, to give you a call and arrange a visit at a suitable time. And if you discover she's been letting herself in and poking around at any time without your knowledge, shop the fuckers. The housing shortage has convinced landlords they can act however they like when by law they bloody can't.",null,0,null,1428699524,null,0,1428700337,0,cq85vel,null,t3_325qbe,null,t1_cq85vel,null,t3_325qbe,null,null,null,1432318294,null,36,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,36,null

(wall of text incoming)

I actually used The Samaritans myself recently. Here's how that came about:

I was near to someone who jumped in front of a high-speed FGW train headed into Paddington while I was waiting for my train to work at Ealing Broadway.

As many people know, they travel on that line at up to 120MPH. The sound of his body hitting the train will stay with me forever.

I was pretty traumatised by that, but no doubt it's nothing compared to what the poor driver saw.

I was in pieces after that, and I had to talk to someone. The woman I spoke to at The Samaritans was lovely, and it really helped me.

I did push her a bit and ask for extra safety staff at the station and why there aren't staff there trying to stop people doing this because it's very common in London. 

Now, FGW has extra safety staff constantly manning the platform where this man died. Thankfully they decided to do that. I don't know if I helped, but hopefully I did.

I recognise the valuable work that The Samaritans do, but I don't think I can really help out at the moment - too much going on with the general election (I'm involved with a party campaign), plus I have a full time job to look after.

I have promised myself that I'll donate Â£600 to Refuge every year though.

Here's the thread I made when I witnessed this horrifying tragedy :/

&gt;The __Paedophile Information Exchange__ (PIE) was a British pro-[paedophile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paedophile) activist group, founded in October 1974 and officially disbanded in 1984.  They were described by the [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) in 2007 as ""an international organisation of people who trade [obscene material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscene_material).""

null,false,pepe_le_shoe,null,null,null,"In the literal sense yes, but in the macroeconomic sense it's small and not relevant to the issue that 'austerity' is being touted as the solution to. 

It's a flawed notion based on personal finance notions of a balance, and credit, and debt, but none of those things function the same way for a nation state as they do for an individual. There's no loan shark threatening to break Britain's knees for owing money, and there's no mortgage broker threatening to kick us out of the isles for not keeping up with the interest on our loans. At a national level, most government operate with colossal amounts of debt by any normal person's standard, but that's not really a problem. 

In order for austerity to be the solution to the problem of economic stagnation, you have to assume the lack of growth, the deficit, and the level of debt, are having some negative impact on the economy and will further inhibit or not allow for or promote growth. Generally these things have not been the case, though for some countries, like spain, the budget deficit can affect the countries credit rating, but again, that doesn't necessarily work in the same way as your personal credit rating. 

I'm not a believer in keynesian economics really, but I do agree with his ideas about the feedback loop when people 'tighten their belts'. Regardless of where the cuts start, government budgets, private investment, consumer spending, etc. the result is the same; spending goes down, economic growth slows. Where do the conservatives think the money they cut back on was going? It was going to individuals (wages) and businesses. Reducing the spending and investment power of either/both is a recipe for economic stagnation. Like it or not, developed civilisation runs on economic growth, so we have to play the game, we have to kick-start growth, which just can't be achieved by directly inhibiting it.

null,false,MsAverage,null,null,null,"So, basically, all the topic is not about your finances, but about your dignity? About your ""right"" to live not in an ""awful"" place, for which you made ""all the sacrifices"". 

We can look in this, if you wish. I do not guarantee a pleasant experience, but you need some reconciliation with reality, there is a Â£166k gap, right? 

First, do not try to sell ""a very poor background"" in the same package with ""an awful place"". If you were from truly poor background, such a place would have been quite normal for you. Furthermore, buying a house for a person from poor background is a mammoth task by definition, big deal and pulling on all the resources, while you are clearly surprised that it requires more that filling in a couple of forms in the bank.

Second, you, as a household, are poor. The line of poverty in this country goes, generally speaking, between families with one income and two-income families. Two programmers on Â£50k can live comfortably. Â£50k + Â£10k, no family support, is a bit tight. ""Bottom housing ladder for bottom income jobs"" - and your partner is one of ""them"", remember that.

Third, ""a software engineer on Â£50k"" after 11 years of higher education sounds like a loser. 3 years are more than enough. I am not even sorry because of your sneer to the ""people in retail"" who supposedly deserve (unlike you) to live in ""awful"" ""rubber-stamped"" places. You know, many of them have no respect to your ""sacrifices"" for the higher education, which is, according to some opinions, no more than a kindergarten for grown-ups, where they are spoon-fed with intellectual entertainments from their zone of close development.

Well, this my opinion on HE, it is. I did not go to uni, started working full-time at 18 and by 29 I paid off my first mortgage (and started learning English with the spare money). 11 years of studies vs 11 years of work - let me guess what puts a person closer to home ownership. But fear not, once you started to earn, house acquisition will take shorter than for a person without higher education. And do consider milking the parents. Grandchildren is usually a trump card.

null,false,AnonymousTurtle,null,null,null,"Well this is very complex and not quite this simplify-able. Midwife led units are really sold on the idea of reduced intervention and I can see that. The jump then from midwife led unit to home birth is the one that is kind of harder to sell and to an extent not even NICE does it. They say nulliparous women should be advised to go to at least a midwife led unit and that even for multiparous women the women should be counselled about a slight increase in risk, which is kind of balanced against a more cozy and nice homely environment, I guess. It's also more cost-effective for the NHS.

NICE doesn't though suggest that home births are better or safer or even as safe as a midwife or obstetrician led unit. They only say that in the safest of the safe births (uncomplicated, multiparous) home births are safe.

And so getting back to the blog of the obstetrician linked here - she has a perfectly reasonable position that can be reconciled with what NICE say. Having said that obstetric outcomes on the whole in the UK are really not great at all compared to the Americans and the vast majority of the EU - so it's a legitimate question to ask where the UK is going wrong and whether the guidance is as good as it could be.",null,0,null,1428709828,null,0,false,0,cq8bm02,null,t3_324muq,null,t1_cq8bm02,null,t1_cq8ay0e,null,null,null,1432321069,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null
