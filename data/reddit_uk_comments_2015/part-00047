&gt;Antisemitic incidents
Manchester, February 2014

&gt;Swastikas and the phrase “Jewish slag” daubed on gravestones at a Jewish cemetery.

&gt;Manchester, March 2014

&gt;An identifiably Jewish man was cycling to synagogue when youths jumped out at him, causing him to wobble on his bike. They then surrounded him and called him a “Jew”. He slipped and the group kicked him while he was on the ground. He did not suffer serious injury.

&gt;London, March 2014

&gt;A university student took a photograph of an identifiably Jewish person on a bus and them posted it on Twitter with the comment, “50 retweets and I’ll knock this Jew out”.

&gt;Norfolk, July 2014

&gt;A leaflet found among Israeli produce in a supermarket featured an image of the Israeli flag with the title “The flag of Zionist racist scum”. It read: “Deny the Holocaust? Of course there was a holocaust. What a pity Adolf and Co didn’t manage to finish the job properly!”

&gt;London, October 2014

&gt;Five girls from a Jewish secondary school were approached by a man at a London underground station who said: “Being Jewish is wrong. You are going to die if you carry on being Jewish,” and “I will kill you all after school.” He grabbed one of the girls by the wrist and said: “Come with me and be a Christian”.

This mentions nothing about failing to investigate.

&gt;“[My] experience of council as it was and is – Asian men very powerful, and the white British are very mindful of racism and frightened of racism allegations so there is no robust challenge. They had massive influence in the town. For example, I know all the backgrounds to the Asian Councillors… but don’t know anything about white Members. Not about race only but the power and influence – the family links in those communities are still very strong. Definitely an issue of race.”

I can't actually make head nor tail out of this quote.

&gt;The issue [of CSE perpetrators] was predominately Asian men and they were scared that would cause a problem. We would tell them that in the forums and they were uncomfortable. Stats on ethnicity were taken out of presentations. There was resistance to focusing on who the perpetrators were.

No mention here of the investigation being blocked.

&gt;I got my knuckles rapped by [manager] on that occasion for mentioning Asian taxi drivers… she had been told [what I’d said] was controversial and not to mention ethnicity.

Again, more to do with phrasing than actual investigating. No actual mention anywhere of the investigation being sidelined.

Is there any evidence, anywhere, that an investigation was actually blocked due to the race of the suspects? There's a lot of talk here about phrasing, but no mention of actually blocking any investigations. None of these comments seem to refer to the investigation in any way.

null,false,q_pop,null,null,null,"Generous final salary scheme - USS provide guaranteed benefits of 1/80th of your final salary plus a tax-free of lump sum of 3x this figure for each year you remain a member.

If you were there for 5 years and earn £40,000 in your final year you would have accrued 5/80*40,000 = £2,500 PA + £7,500 lump sum, inflation-protected until retirement and inflation-linked in retirement. Put into context, this is worth in excess of £70,000 today but over the years could be effectively worth much more than this, due to the guaranteed inflation-linking.

It's hard to put a lump sum value on it because USS takes all the risk - they are required to make investment returns or contributions into the fund to match their liabilities.

In the above scenario, even if you have made contributions of 22.5% of £40,000 salary for 5 years (i.e. £45,000 total contributions, gross of tax), it's looking like quite a good deal. It looks like a phenomenal deal for those who are only paying 6.5% contributions.

Private pension - a SIPP is a private pension. You would obtain a ""Cash Equivalent Transfer Value"" from USS and transfer the lump-sum to SIPP. You would lose all guarantees associated and hope that investment returns over the years equal the benefits you've lost. Generally speaking historically, this hasn't been the case.

I guess you could say I was exaggerating, slightly. It's a fact that O2 and Vodafone's 3G coverage is among the lowest, nationally, and both have risked censure by Ofcom for not meeting coverage levels that their licences stipulate.

O2 in addition seems to suffer from generally bad performance, constant outages (it's better now than it used to be, but the years after the iPhone came out were not good times - including two major outages in the space of a couple of months because the same piece of equipment failed, and a lack of redundancy), just a poor experience overall. So either they're investing in 24 carat gold equipment cabinets or they aren't investing much at all.

Compare this to 3 and EE (and as T-Mobile/Orange) who have met and exceeded coverage commitments, have normally been at the top of any performance measurement, and both have never had the same frequency or scale of outages that O2 have had.

&gt; Also, your statement about o2 and Vodafone sharing networks is not true. Both o2 and Vodafone's masts are shared between each other with o2 maintaining those in the west of the country, and Vodafone, the east.

I am aware that the VF-O2 deal is not like the MBNL 3G arrangement, but I didn't want to overcomplicate things for what was a passing comment - but note that I did say ""shares parts of their network"". The main point is that 3 will have a pickle on their hands - their existing MBNL commitments, and whatever deal they have with Vodafone through buying O2. If they'd have been able to buy EE it'd be a much better fit.

The total of the world economy was $68tn last time I looked, but it will be a bit bigger now. So that's why I said ~$70tn.

3% global growth which is about what it is would equate to adding about $2tn to the global economy.

I don't know who is confusing you about simple economic facts and statistics. Whoever it is - I suggest you stop reading them.

Vince Cable's book will contain a load of BS and lies - no thanks. As I said to you before Vince Cable is not going to tell anyone the truth about the banks or the monetary system. I learnt my economics from people who had previously spent the best part of 30 years learning about the actual facts of the global and monetary system. I also read up on it quite a lot with books written by people who knew what they were talking about (and were not out to deceive people - like the banks are).

There are a lot of lies told about the banking system in the mainstream - the big banks like it that way.

But how universities divide their money between departments/research/wages/etc has no bearing on whether or not they're for profit institutions.

Now, you can argue that revenue vs profit is semantics, but you'd be wrong: it's a very important distinction.  Profit is revenue minus costs, which then goes to the owner and may either be reinvested or extracted (given to shareholders or partners or whatever).  For profit businesses have as their primary goal the maximising of this surplus and everything else is just a means to this end.

Universities aren't allowed to make profit, and so their interests are quite different.  They're instead judged based on things like student surveys and research.

This is extremely important because it shapes what our education system looks like in important ways.  This is visible in America at the moment where there are a number of very large for profit universities that often come in for a lot of [criticism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8pjd1QEA0c) for essentially being huge scams.

The problem is that assuming our major universities are already for profit means that you wouldn't fight against them legally becoming such.  And once you're down that path it's already too late to realise the mistake.

&gt;Of course everything has to earn money - because that's the current state of things. This is not an inherent truth of course. It's just a truth, at the moment.

Good old reddit, downvote someone who's telling the truth. It is indeed correct that the Catholic Church doesn't take its teachings only from the Bible. Let's ignore the irony that the majority of people on this site laugh at religious people for speaking about something they *think* they don't know anything about, and then do exactly the same thing about religion.

Very simple, while Protestant churches only came into existence fairly recently, the Catholic Church is 2,000 years old and was started by Jesus himself (Jesus the man: let's not get into whether or not reddit thinks he has other attributes). He gave the task of starting the Church to Peter, his Apostle, who was the first Bishop of Rome (Pope). The books of the New Testament were then written over the next fifty to seventy-odd years, and finally codified into what we call the Bible over the next 300 years. In other words, not only did the Catholic Church write and eventually assemble the Bible, it existed for centuries before the Bible as we know it today did.

Because of this, while teaching cannot contradict scripture, the Church uses the power and permission it was given by Jesus while he was on earth to implement teaching as it sees fit, as the world and society develops, to ensure that it continues with its task of showing people the way to live as Jesus did for the good of society as a whole in an ever-changing world.

It's somewhat frightening that so many people these days are atheists, but know so little about the thing they claim to have such a fundamental disagreement with. Then again, we are genetically a Protestant country now, so it's not surprising that the best most people can do is ""It's not in the Bible, so it must be okay.""",null,0,null,1423147046,null,0,false,0,coc0kds,null,t3_2urxul,null,t1_coc0kds,null,t1_cobf36w,null,null,null,1424164206,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

Candidate B who will line his/her own pockets, ignore the electorate and is a puppet of big corporations that pay them bribes I mean donations.

An example of a claim for this would be any computer or laptop with a nVidia 8000 series GPU. nVidia acknowledged every single one they made was faulty. Therefore if you had a laptop with this GPU for 3 years and the GPU failed you could make a claim because it was a manufacturing fault and a laptop is expected to reasonably last at least 3 years. The retailer would be required to repair the laptop or to give a partial refund if it couldn't. Note I said retailer and not manufacturer. This is because your contract is with the retailer, not the manufacturer. Many retailers will quite incorrectly tell you to contact a manufacturer when you have a fault. This is not lawful although in some cases, i.e. Microsoft and Xbox 360 claims, it can result in a far quicker and more satisfactory resolution.

It really all depends on how february goes, though. if we breeze through february, momentum will carry us. if we toil with our direct rivals, we will not make top 4. anyways, my prediction is we'll get a europa league spot and go again. my hope is we nick 4th and keep going. my optimistic self thinks we can nick 3rd for automatic qualification...BR has proven he can get the team firing for 11 games straight, lets win 15 straight ;)",null,0,null,1423147365,null,0,false,0,coc0pp2,null,t3_2uv6ap,null,t1_coc0pp2,null,t1_cobz6kt,null,null,null,1424164067,null,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6,null

I think the reason is effort. Adebayor is keen to sit around and collect a paycheck with very little work put into his play.  Yes, he starred last year (I'm assuming) because he thought he'd get his contract extended with a raise. And instead of apologizing for bad form/promising to do better, he blames bullshit reasons like ""bad juju."" Do I think we should be booing him? No. Do I think the boos, whether out loud or internal (I'm sure there are plenty) are justified to a certain extent? Yes. 

Soldado is another story. I think the reason people continue to give Soldado a break is because he is constantly trying to make an issue of justifying the fee we paid for him. He recognizes he's been shit and he shows grief at that reality. He has apologized to fans and club alike for his performances. He has expressed genuine remorse/guilt/shame (or what seems to be such) that he has let down the club. And that is why people, I think, find it easier to give Soldado a break over Adebayor. I, personally, do not think he should be given any benefit of the doubt anymore (I think his grace/amnesty period ran out a long time ago) but each person is going to have their convictions.

It's odd you suggest those are connected that way.  Basic supply and demand curve relationship would suggest as wages at the top rise, funding for education would too.  By artificially restricting wages at the top, you'd be removing money that insensitiveses production.  Planned economies generally do worse at this than free market.  See China, Russia, Vietnam, Cuba etc.

&gt; giving us more people able to do the more important jobs

I think you missed my first comment about jobs that require communication.  Some things are inherently bad at scaling (diminishing returns).  These are normally roles in which actions have magnified consequences, such as managerial, where adding one extra person may result in two layers having to be added.

This creates the problem, you need to get someone capable of doing that job, how do you keep them still working?  By offering them more money.  Most prop traders I know want to retire, it's only their greed keeping them in such a horrible demanding job.  If you've paid your mortgage, why bother working that hard?

&gt; However at some point we're going to have to accept that there's going to be less jobs every year

Accept that's not what we are seeing, instead we're seeing a split, more jobs for people who have certain high end skills, and fewer jobs for people who are un-skilled.

The problem is we are marching into a situation in which people have jobs that result in a 'multiplier effect' that is they are say designers or developers or managers, some mechanism multiplies up their value.  The other side is almost going to be coffee shop workers, those whose value has no multiplier attached.

null,false,toward_the_forward,null,null,null,"The definitions and distinctions of the mechanics that universities use to take money from here, put it there, cream a little off the top to fund bloated VC salaries - it bears little to no difference to how a business model works.  In fact, I'd say you'd have to get pretty economically specific before you could start pulling out things that genuinely define them as different - and even then only in process, not so much in consequence.  

The only real difference is that the university (presently) would need to throw up smoke and mirrors, reasons for this and that, justifications, etc etc - where as the business can just cream off the top and nobody can really argue against it, because as you say, everything is just a means to that end.

I will also say:

&gt;Universities aren't allowed to make profit

What does that even *mean* exactly?  Of course *universities* don't/can't make profit.  The term 'universities' in this context is used to indicate the '*boys in control of the university*'.  With that in mind, 'universities' certainly do make profit, which pay inflated salaries - that's what a salary is - profit.  I just don't really understand the difference between a VC earning mad cash from a university, and a MD earning mad cash from a for profit business.  They're both businesses, and they're both earning money from it.  Both situations are just essentially '*a man making profit*'.  In that sense, universities make profit - and that's all I ever mean when I say that.  

The point I made originally (which I will reiterate before we disappear down the internet discussion hole of points, counter-points, misunderstands, deliberate misunderstands, answers to questions that weren't asked, etc etc) was this;

If you can't pay for your education, you will not be getting educated.  Making money is a core value of universities, education is simply the means to the end.

Now I'm not saying this is what I want.  It's not nice, it certainly isn't best for most people, and it really does devalue and dilute what universities *should* be doing.

yes i listed the best players in those positions in the world. so let me give you some examples of players who are viewed as ""better players"" or ""world class"" and do a stats comparison...oscar, a player who gets far more shine than coutinho (and deservedly so until recently, i hate to admit) has 6 pl goals and 7 assists and has played 1 match fewer. he is a full year older than phil and takes free kicks. phil's best role isn't to be a goal scorer, but a creator in chief. i mean jesus how many chances does he need to create, how much of the creativity burden does he need to shoulder. top scoring cm generally score between 10-15 goals per season..that is what stevie's output was. there are still 15 pl matches to be played and coutinho, if he chips in with a total of 5, has had a very productive season in terms of goalscoring. he also was primarily deployed as an  8 for the first half of the season. in this more advanced role, he has shown a goal scoring eye and has been in dangerous positions. 

sorry, not to bash on you, but i have been seeing this comment around the sub for the last 2 weeks ad it kills me when people say ""phil won't be world class until he adds more goals..."" well im sorry, the last month he has looked world class to me, and that has to do with his pressing ability, his passing, his dribbling and his ability to make others around him better.

You could make almost the exact same film about any other group of hunger strikers without changing much.

For the remaining 25%, I think the idea was to keep it simple otherwise it would cost more to collect than it is worth. The approximate value of your house at a certain date is easy to calculate and most likely bears some relation to your wealth.

Originally rates were based on quite a complex assessment of the house value. It was a bit crazy, if you built a garage or fitted central heating, your rates went up. It was complicated and rather unfair (if you built a car port instead of a garage, your rates didn't go up).

Then they simplified it too much with the poll tax. Everyone, rich or poor, paid the same. That was totally unfair and led to riots.

The banding idea is a simplification of the rates. It isn't totally fair, people sometimes end up cash poor but owning an expensive house, but for most people it is reasonably fair.

null,false,ocramc,null,null,null,"1) For a regular investment, yes. You should be able to make deposits using a debit card though and invest as and when, although a) there's usually a higher minimum investment for one-off investments, typically between £100 and £500 and b) if your broker charges for fund transactions, one-off transactions are usually more expensive.

2) The Vanguard Lifestrategy funds are certainly eligible for ISA inclusion - as long as the broker offers the funds then you should be able to buy them within an ISA wrapper

3) The short answer is yes. You can only deposit money in one investment ISA within a financial year, but you can reuse an existing ISA in a new financial year

4) The fund manager will either switch your investment into a new fund (after giving notice, which your broker should inform you of) or return the cash to you after selling the fund's assets. Your broker is legally required to ringfence client assets and if they stop trading, typically their client book would be sold off to a new broker otherwise I imagine the FSCS would step in to transfer the administration to a new broker.

Next time its dark and rainy you might need to use the bike and you will be that much better off for practicing in it.

You see some rich people going against the grain and giving their children nothing because they believe it ruins them to have everything handed to them. In many cases the parents were rags to riches, hard working risk takers... and their children end up like Paris Hilton.

Saying that, if we introduce too tight a control on inheritance, what incentive is there to amass wealth?

null,false,QPRCHOC,null,null,null,"None of us are happy about the situation right now, but I think we're all aware of how insignificant football is in the grand scheme of things. I agree that football is a lot more important for the people who's careers are built around it, sure, but in this case it's the social and psychological adversity that the individual is facing, the strategies he is using to cope and the way his brain is wired that is relevant to his depression. In this case Carlisle has had bad experiences with football, but the aetiology of depression can be hundreds of different things. Let's be honest though, a career in football is generally a lot better than most careers elsewhere. Carlisle's situation isn't specific for football. Depression can happen to anybody at anytime, as you say.

You have a fair point, but again, nobody's really comparing our predicament to people suffering from severe depression. I genuinely feel sympathy for the guy and I hope he gets better, but I'm not going to start adopting the ""it could be worse"" mentality with regards things at the opposite end of the spectrum. If we get relegated, fined £50M and demoted to the conference, I'm not going to think ""I suppose I could be having my intestines pulled through my mouth while being burned alive"", it would be an awful scenario, but you accept it and appreciate that football is completely separate from other aspects of life.

It sort of works, except when it doesn't, so I think it would be hard to change just parts of it without a complete root-and-branch change, but with a thousand years of ""this is how we've always done it"" in the background it's hard to see how you could get it done.

[This](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-20526380) BBC piece from 2012 has the  (record-high) number of MSM infections as half of the 6,280 (3,140)  new cases that year.

So with very rough maths, with stats the first articles that appeared we have:

3,140 out of 272,500 homosexual men having HIV. Giving 0.0115% of gay men having a new case of HIV per year.

Mason should be slotted here next to Bentaleb (their partnership has been strong for most of the season). Dembele has been strong behind the striker but Eriksen is at his best in that position, so I would be against slotting him in at Right Winger. I assume that Dembele will come in as a sub for either Townsend or Chadli later in the match and Eriksen will move over to the wing. I think that Lamela is a less effective sub, so if he doesn't start, he probably will not play.

The only way I can think of them being similar is that they're good on corners (offensively) and have a tendency to dive in for challenges. Lovren is what I would call a ""front-footed"" defender, who always tries to push in and stop the attack at the earliest possible time and tries to play controlled passes almost all the time. He's much more of a risk taker and earlier this season he was a liability because he was taking risks that weren't paying off (also was doing poorly tracking runners). Skrtel is always on the back foot, dropping off when attackers are in space so that he will absolutely not get caught out. His instincts are to never be personally responsible for a goal, so he always takes safe options when passing and will clear the ball if he feels he's under any pressure whatsoever in defensive situations. This approach has been good for us now that Lucas is in the line up as we get a chance to regroup and win the ball back in the midfield, and outside of own goals (which he hasn't done much this year) he's very rarely personally responsible for goals. The only problem is that he can be indirectly responsible, like in the buildup to the Ivanovic goal in the League Cup where he cut out a pass going into the box but instead of controlling it he put it safely out for a throw in. Unfortunately we never fully cleared it after that and we ended up conceding about a minute later. Not directly responsible by any means, but a more positive defender (like Sakho or an in form Lovren) would have never put us in that position.

Theoretically Lovren and Skrtel should work well together, but I think Lovren's recklessness going forward to make challenges really does Skrtel's head in and as a result they were completely disorganized together.",null,0,null,1423152465,null,0,false,0,coc3cl2,null,t3_2uv9qk,null,t1_coc3cl2,null,t1_cobzngs,null,null,null,1424161355,null,-1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-1,null

Principal city is belfast, main industry used to be shipbuilding but that's fallen by the wayside with globalisation and the rise of the korean shipbuilding and bangladeshi shipbreaking powerhouses. Leaves current economic output as agriculture, mining (gold/iron?) and services, right? No doubt some manufacturing exists as it does everywhere but nowhere near as big as it used to be.

Population are vast majority white British with a majority descending from ulster scots (traditionally protestant) and a significant but lesser (though growing) portion descended from catholic Irish families. 

This proportion wasn't quite as stark before the partition of Ireland in the 20's, but came about as protestant Irish fled north during the Irish war of independence and Irish civil war. The number of protestants in the south has declined heavily since Ireland left the UK. There didn't seem to be a similar exodus from the north, leading to the plurality of beliefs and the tension that followed. 

There were some heavily discriminatory policies in place towards catholics in the 60's &amp; 70's which helped lay the kindling for the troubles (for which also came about from many more slights and hurts than i can list here, a big one being the whole colonisation effort which led to the protestant ulster scots being there in the first place) 

The troubles were some nasty shit, thankfully behind us all, but still close enough to remind everyone to stop doing that sort of thing.

They are both reckless and dive into tackles, they dive into headers and take ridiculous risks to make contact with the attacking players. They also have terrible positioning, terrible organisation skills, both lose concentration at vital points, very prone to error, and are tactically inept. They break the line of defence often and leave their other centre back completely in the dark as to what they're going to do. The unpredictability of the duo makes them unable to work together.

The only real difference in them is that Skrtel is a bigger fan of backing off and allowing the attackers metres of space.

Both require a vocal organiser alongside them. Skrtel needs a Carragher, Lovren needs a Fonte. Theoretically they shouldn't work together and they don't, you need a balance. Good central defensive partnerships require two types of defenders, having one that is similar to Skrtel or Lovren creates problems.

Honestly in theory how should they work together? How can two reckless defenders work together? How can two defenders who struggle with communication work together? How can two defenders who both struggle tactically work together?

null,false,manygoose,logo,,null,"I believe this a poor decision by management - unless they know something we don't, i.e Jovetic is going in summer.

Assuming he isn't going; Dzeko should have been replaced by Bony. If our intentions are to progress in both the Champions league and continue winning in the PL then we would've wanted our best CL performer in the CL squad, and best PL performer in the PL squad. 

In terms of player's form; Jovetic in this moment is the better CL player for us this season - he was crucial in the win vs Bayern, and he's been playing regular football because of striker injuries. When we had Aguero and Dzeko out, but we had Jovetic as a lone striker in the PL, we still weren't scoring goals; so he can't be used as a lone striker (bear that in mind).

Dzeko has been injured for a while now, and hasn't really got going. There are still a few games for him up into form before the Barca game, but is that really enough time. His record at the club is fantastic, especially his impact on both our PL titles (look back to the run in last season). Clearly a proven goalscorer and can be used as a lone striker.

In the CL I guess that we will playing with 1 striker, in a 4-2-3-1, otherwise we would be overrun in midfield. So that means that Nasri, Toure, Silva, Aguero are going to almost certainly be in the starting XI. This means that (assuming Bony is our second choice striker) Bony will be used as a super sub, and as Dzeko holds a similar style to Bony, he wouldn't get any play time (we can't seriously play 3 strikers in the CL). So Jovetic would've made more sense to be in the squad because he could be a sub for a second striker position or in the AM 3 behind Aguero. Therefore bringing more dynamic to the squad, and cover for injuries/tiredness. 

Lets say Aguero got injured, then Bony would become the lone striker, and a super sub of Jovetic would make more sense than Dzeko in that situation (IMO Jovetic is a better second striker than Dzeko).

Now lets think abut resting players. So with Dzeko in the squad, it means surely Jovetic will get more playing time in PL (maybe not). But he doesn't work as a lone striker (as said above) so we wouldn't be able to rest all the strikers at once. Whereas if Jovetic was in the CL squad, then Dzeko would be able to cope with playing as a lone striker to rest all the others. 

Alternatively you could see it as Jovetic not having CL football will also allow Pelle to rest Nasri/Silva in the PL (Jovetic can cover those AM positions aswell), but I would argue he could do this with Jovetic in the CL squad.

Rant over - IMO Jovetic should be the CL squad, and Dzeko kept for the PL games.

Skrtel makes reckless challenges on balls he likely won't win, but he's not breaking the line of defence to do it, as you say, he's doing it when there's an attacker in his area. Skrtel very rarely breaks the line of defence and generally has good positioning (especially on set pieces), he just doesn't react to the other CBs movements as well as he should. The reason they should work in theory is that when Lovren charges out to make a challenge Skrtel is backing off to fill the space in behind, but he's inconsistent on it. It should be part of his game, but he needs time to work with Lovren to sort it out. It worked between him and Agger for quite a while in this way: Agger is aggressive and would push forward to cut out attacks and Skrtel would cover for him, only he doesn't know how Lovren plays so doesn't do it instinctively. Though Agger was much less aggressive when he pushed up to cut out a pass and chose his battles better.

I actually don't think they're poor tactically, Lovren especially. I'm sure you've seen the analysis by Gary Neville on Lovren from last year and he showed that Lovren was extremely aware of where he and the rest of the defensive line should be and how it should react to new situations. The problem we have is that when Lovren was at Southampton he had Fonte who was also very astute and new how to react to Lovren stepping up but was comfortable following his directions as well, whereas we have Skrtel who probably doesn't yet trust Lovren's leadership and doesn't know what Lovren's going to do. Skrtel can be weaker tactically in reacting to changing situations, but he's able to adapt to different tactics if he's been made aware of them ahead of time. He's certainly not one of the most astute defenders, but it's not like he's a complete idiot and he can understand and follow instructions well. I think Sakho would partner Lovren better just because I feel like he's better at reading the game, but it'll still take time for them to feel each other out.",null,0,null,1423154307,null,0,false,0,coc4f4k,null,t3_2uv9qk,null,t1_coc4f4k,null,t1_coc3qbq,null,null,null,1424160248,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

As surely, ones use of Council services is not dependant on said value. Worse, your ability to pay CT may fluctuate substantially depending on how stable your income is. 

As such, it is likely better that CT was collected from Income Tax, but there would be a minimal cost in doing so, if doing it strictly by geographical area of payees as you would have to track such movements. Although, I fail to see how this would be much harder than keeping HMRC apprised of your location, as you have to do presently. Nor can I really see how it could be anymore expensive than each council maintaining its own CTax department.

Of course the issue is with using Income Tax, is that not everyone pays it, such as those with no income, like Pensioners. Now we can either agree that they don't need to pay it, or merely keep HMRC billing them forever more, much like the Council does, using an applicable minimal rate.

All in all, it is likely cheaper, easier and fairer to base it upon one's income. Applying it based on house value, number of windows, or anything like such is an anarchism.

Also Dzeko has been out for ages now, and I don't see where he fits in the CL squad. Okay he works if Bony or Aguero get injured, but Jovetic works if Aguero, Bony, Nasri, Silva, Navas or Milner get injured i.e he can play that vital role of linking the midfield to the strike force.

According to Whoscored.com:
Jovetic: 19apps , 5 goals (all in PL), 3 assists
Dzeko: 18apps, 4 goals (2 PL), 2 assists.

&gt;

&gt;The __shaka sign__, sometimes known as ""hang loose"", is a gesture often associated with [Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii) and [surf culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_culture). It consists of extending the thumb and smallest finger while holding the three middle fingers curled, and gesturing in salutation while presenting the front or back of the hand; the hand may be rotated back and forth for emphasis. The shaka sign was adopted from local Hawaiian culture by visiting surfers in the 1960s, and its use has spread around the world.

Skrtel doesn't react to whole situations as well as he should not just his partner's movements. And if Lovren takes a risky decision to make a header for example, Skrtel will definitely be in the wrong position. 

The Agger example is completely different, Agger is one of the best readers of a game I've seen play for Liverpool. He was tactically impeccable, and fantastic on and with the ball. He didn't charge out like Lovren does often.

Lovren was next to Fonte- an organiser, and alongside Clyne and Shaw- very good full backs who have pace to track back and cover gaps. Lovren has shown zero tactical awareness since signing, and he didn't need to at Southampton. 

Personally I don't trust either Skrtel or Lovren to partner Sakho but thats my personal preference, Rodgers likes his defenders to be able to score and contribute offensively but I don't see that as neccessary at all. But I would be willing to give Lovren chances, as he is younger than Skrtel and can change the way he plays.

The capital city is Belfast. Other towns and cities that I can think of right now include Derry/Londonderry, Portadown, and Rostrevor which I think is probably tiny but was the hometown of my old flatmate. Roughly 2 million people live there (NI, not Rostrevor), and there's a massive lake in the middle called Lough Neagh that looks like it harbours unknowable things. I think it might be the biggest lake in the UK but I'm not sure. There's obviously the Giant's Causeway on the coast somewhere, but I'm not sure where. There's a relatively short distance between NI and that little arm of Scotland that has Stranraer on it, and that's been mooted as one of the possible (albeit unlikely) routes for an Ireland-to-Britain tunnel or bridge, should one ever be built.

The issue over the name of Derry/Londonderry seems to be quite loaded. I don't know the full facts but I looked it up once and I have a vague recollection that it was officially renamed ""Londonderry"" after it was rebuilt with help from the London... livery companies? Something like that. Nowadays, I hear ""Derry"" much more often.

George Best was Northern Irish. Liam Neeson still is, as are Rory McIlroy and Van Morrison. Maik Taylor isn't, but we can gloss that. Darron Gibson and James McClean were born in Northern Ireland but identify simply as Irish and play for the Republic. This seems to have become primarily about footballers. Jonny Evans. Corry Evans. David Healy. Norman Whiteside. Nigel Worthington. I think I'm done.

Pat Jennings.

People sometimes call Northern Ireland ""Ulster"", but that isn't accurate because some of the counties of Ulster are part of the Republic.

Steven Davis.

Politically, I'm obviously aware of the Troubles but slightly embarrassed to say that I don't really know the details. I'm aware of Bloody Sunday but couldn't tell you exactly what happened or why. I'm aware of the Omagh bombing, but the same applies. I know a little more about the Good Friday Agreement, which among other things enshrined the principle that the people of Northern Ireland could change their political status at any time to join the Republic or even declare independence. This might be out of date, but whenever it was that I checked, the consensus was close to 50/50 but leant slightly towards staying in the UK.

I'm aware of Orange marches and Orangemen, who have nothing to do with New Jersey or Willy Wonka as far as I know. I know nothing of Northern Irish catholic identity except that catholics traditionally tend to support a united Ireland. Northern Irish protestants are more likely to want to remain part of the UK, and some of them seem to embrace an almost cartoonish pride in Britishness that many people in Britain itself find quite hard to relate to. However, from meeting Northern Irish people around England, it seems that there are a lot of people who really just want to get on with their lives and aren't highly politicised in one direction or the other, even if they do have feelings about the issue.

null,false,ZombieWomble,null,null,null,"&gt; This is purely scientific, it has nothing to do with equality, its about public safety.

Two points:

Firstly, to put the public safety argument in perspective: The [SABTO report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/216109/dh_129909.pdf) commissioned in GB to study this question found that the move to accepting all MSM donors with a 1 year exclusion criteria would only increase risks by 0.5% of the baseline risk (p48), which was already on the order of 1 in 4 million donations or so. So, an additional risk of HIV transmission of one per *eight hundred million* transfusions. 

Or, put another way, that's 1 additional case of HIV-infected blood getting through screening in NI every 12,500 years or so, assuming we never improve our ability to detect HIV. Public safety is all well and good, but the associated risk here is the definition of minimal. 

This leads into the second point: If you want to argue that a risk of 1 infection per ten millennia is still too great, then singling out MSM is clearly discriminatory, as there are other groups and rules which pose far greater risks to the blood supply. The most striking example: Having hetrosexual sex with a person known to be infected with HIV carries a one-year exclusion. I don't think there's any conceivable argument that this group is a lower-risk category than MSM as a whole. This is the basis for the ruling that the position is irrational - the health minister can't say risks at this level are unacceptable for MSM and ignore all of the other categories of risk. 

(As an aside: If you dig into the SABTO report, it actually finds that compliance with the rules is dramatically more important than exclusion periods. If just 2% more of MSM are willing to comply with a 1-year ban rather than a lifetime ban, then it would actually be a net reduction in risk of HIV infection in the system).",null,0,null,1423156464,null,0,false,0,coc5p5u,null,t3_2uuwdo,null,t1_coc5p5u,null,t1_cobxff3,null,null,null,1424159033,null,7,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,7,null
null,false,skwinter,lfc68,,null,"I agree that Skrtel is unlikely to sort out his problems at this age and that Lovren and Agger are different. Agger was a very good reader of the game, better than both Skrtel and Lovren and didn't often put himself in unfavourable positions unlike how Lovren did at the beginning of the year. However he would step up to challenge a player or get to a loose pass quite often and Skrtel did a good job being the second line of defence in case Agger didn't succeed, which he should still be able to do. Disagree about Fonte though, he was always the second fiddle, covering for Lovren when he needed to, but Lovren was definitely the organizer for the Southampton defence last season. 

I don't think we should switch Lovren for Skrtel in this formation though, I think this formation suits Skrtel really well since he's not really required to be adaptable and all he really has to do is win headers and make tackles/clearances without needing to be at all creative in his passing. If Lovren is going to come into this line up it'll be in place of Can since the wider positions require better passing ability and awareness, while still requiring strong aerial presence at the least. I'd also like to see how Can does in CM in Henderson's recent position as I think he brings a lot of goal threat that none of our other CMs do. I'm not begging for the formation to change though, it's working well now and there's no pressing need to make a switch, but if we get any injuries to Can or Henderson it's what I'd like to see happen.",null,0,null,1423156467,null,0,false,0,coc5p8v,null,t3_2uv9qk,null,t1_coc5p8v,null,t1_coc4ude,null,null,null,1424159031,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

&gt;People break their bail conditions every day, but we barely spend a penny on it. (They usually reoffend and get caught anyway)

Ok, so first statement:

&gt; People break their bail conditions every day

Fair enough, easy statement to make given the number of people on bail at one time then it's hard to dispute that people will be breaking bail conditions on a daily basis. You do back it up with the PDF from the government.

&gt; but we barely spend a penny on it.

You first link doesn't mention it and I couldn't really see any reference to police spending on people who break their bail conditions in the second. So statement not supported by your statistics.

&gt; They usually reoffend 

The implication that most of the people who are known to have breached their bail conditions, but the police aren't bothering to spend any money pursuing, reoffend.

Well again, I can't seem to find anything to support that in what you posted. Whilst it's no surprise that some criminals on bail go on to commit more crimes, there is no indication as to how many are known to have broken their bail conditions when they did so. Again, statement not supported by your statistics.

But let's look at it this way. Say you're right, most people who break their bail conditions go on to reoffend. Well then surely that means the chances of Mr Assange reoffending are quite high? If we know exactly where he is then surely the right course of action is to be in a position to arrest him to prevent him from committing a crime?

Is Prime Minister's Questions really that interesting (or useful)? 

Take this week for example. Miliband asked Cameron five times about hedge fund tax avoiders and five fucking times Cameron ignored the question and instead spent time criticising the Labour Party. When that was done with you then had a string of Tory MP's standing up to ask prearranged 'questions' that were nothing more than praise of Tory policy that gave Cameron the opportunity to deliver some sound bites and piss away a bunch of time.

Every time I watch PMQs I am just left with the overwhelming feeling that it's entirely meaningless, a complete sham, and a showcase of absolutely everything that is wrong with politics in this country. As long as the PM is able to ignore questions (and go off topic), and as long as half the questions asked are staged to let the party in power look good I think it is entirely irrelevant whether politicians are treated with deference because either way it is a sham that serves no purpose. Nothing but a bunch of public school politicians (or people wishing they were) playing the game and acting like pathetic children as they do it whilst conning us all that this is somehow part of the democratic process.",null,0,null,1423157880,null,0,1423166494,0,coc6k1y,null,t3_2uv0c3,null,t1_coc6k1y,null,t1_coc5alq,null,null,null,1424158219,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

1) Requires active monitoring of every tour date

2) When a tour date sells out, venue and act must collaborate on adding a new date. This process takes time in which tickets can and have been touted.

3) Requires you build tours around extending dates. This is less efficient, more messy, could incur more downtime etc. An inefficient method of planning a tour.

4) It's already illegal to tout at similar live events, for instance at football matches. There should be a consistency across law.

5) Buying tickets is partly an SEO / exposure game. Regardless of Stewart Lee opening more dates, consumers will still buy these touted tickets.

6) At the end of the day, it's just a massive ballache having to think about and manage a modular event date tour in order to account for sellouts. It's just shite and annoying.

It spent the majority of its existence as a sectarian statelet with Catholics systematically denied their civil rights by Protestants.
The civil rights movement in the 60s was unable to overcome the brutality of their opponents and the UVF started bombing people and upped the violence ante. Prior to that the IRA were a bit of a non-issue but they rose to prominence as a reaction to violent reprisals to peaceful means for change.

The RUC were judge, jury and executioner within the province and acted as the enforcers of the will of a protestant majority having an almost 100% protestant staffing rate.

The British Army were sent in to keep the sectarian state afloat but only served to exacerbate the problem and produce their own atrocities.

In the 80s the republicans figured out they had enough popular support to employ politics more to their ends and the ballot box strategy came into effect.

In the 90s several unsuccessful ceasefires culminated in the Good Friday Agreement.

Since then things have settled somewhat although not entirely with their being almost daily bomb disposals still the case and the paramilitary organisations fracturing and setting up drug and racketeering empires.

People working as full-time carers work and don't get paid and can't join unions. These are people who make a contribution to society but are often ignored.

There is no list of illegal acts. It doesn't exist, it was just made up by a journalist for flamebait purposes to make the government look ridiculous.

There IS a law against 'extreme' pornography, but most of what is written about it is not true.

http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/extreme_pornography/

""Section 63(7) lists a number of extreme acts including:

a) An act which threatens a person's life; this is not defined in the Act and therefore should be given its ordinary dictionary meaning. The Ministry of Justice note of "" Further information on the new offence of Possession of Extreme Pornographic Images"" at paragraph 11 gives examples of life threatening acts.

b) An act which results in or is likely to result in serious injury to a person's anus, breast or genitals; this could include the insertion of sharp objects (although in some circumstances this can be done in a way that is not likely to result in serious injury) or the mutilation of breasts or genitals. It is likely to be difficult to prove that cases of 'fisting' involve images that show activity that is likely to result in serious injury so these cases need to be handled with particular care. Serious injury is not defined in the Act and should be given its ordinary dictionary meaning, being a question of fact for the District Judge or jury.""

""When assessing whether there are aggravating factors present when considering the public interest in prosecuting, consideration should be given to:

The extent of the circulation of the images, for example whether they were shared between consenting parties or posted more widely, for example on social networking sites.
Whether there is clear and credible evidence of the exploitation of those depicted in the images.""",null,0,null,1423159135,null,0,false,0,coc7bmw,null,t3_2utic7,null,t1_coc7bmw,null,t1_cobk0no,null,null,null,1424157490,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Some sort of Time Lord tech, presumably. We know they've had this ability since they offered the Master a new set of regenerations in Classic Who, it's just never been elaborated on.

&gt;How did the master get new regenerations after being brought back to life?

If you're talking about Simm to Gomez, we don't know that s/he did. It's been established for a long time that the Master has the ability to take over other being's bodies through various methods in lieu of regeneration, it could be something as simple as that.

So let's say it's 1970. You're 25. The sixties are dead, brown corduroy and orange velour are *so* hot right now, and you've found someone to settle down with.

You can just about afford a small terraced house in Hackney. It's not very nice. There's a lot of crime, drugs and general filth. But it's ok, you're young and in love, and you have an ok wage. The bank manager has dragged you over hot coal but in the end you just managed to scrape a mortgage - three times your salary, max - because your partner picked up a job too.

Present day. You're retired. Your final salary pension (which is a term your grandchildren have to look up in a dictionary) plus your state pension plus some shares, maybe, has left you in a good position. Meanwhile the housing market has gone completely bonkers. You open The Telegraph and you and your spouse drop dead from the shock.

Probate happens. All your cash is tied up in your home, bar a few thousand for a rainy day. Through no action of your own, your terraced 2 up 2 down house with half a garden is now worth £500,000 - over 15 times average wage. It runs smack into the inheritance tax threshold at £325,000. Your inheritors owe £70,000 to the state. The house is sold, after costs your inheritors have £400k left. Two generations stand to benefit, things are generally ok. Your two children and four grandchildren get £65,000 each. This is enough to fund some deposits on their own homes. Just. House prices are 15 times salary now, remember?

Firstly there is the type if you rent a council house or from a housing association - this is a means tested benefit that will at most cover the whole amount of your rent. It is this type of benefit that is subject to the ""under occupancy penalty"" or ""bedroom tax"".

the second type is if you are renting from a private Landlord. Called Local Housing Allowance (LHA) it will give you money towards your housing costs dependent on your family size, and your area.

first it calculates how many bedroom you need using a [formula](http://lha-direct.voa.gov.uk/bedroomcalculator.aspx)

The country is divided into ""Broad Rental Market Areas"", within each the rents for each type of property (by bedroom number) are assessed and the amount of benefit is equal to the 30th percentile. you can check the amounts [here](https://lha-direct.voa.gov.uk/search.aspx)",null,0,null,1423160314,null,0,false,0,coc81m7,null,t3_2uuvzx,null,t1_coc81m7,null,t3_2uuvzx,null,null,null,1424156810,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Based on canon, the second doctor was 500 minimum when regenerated, the third was 748, the 4th Doctor was likely late 700s but no exact estimate is given, the fifth was 813 when he regenerated, the 6th was 953, the seventh was 1009 when he regenerated, the eighth Doctor was at least 1125 before he regenerated into the War Doctor, if you don't count the 600 years on Orbis. If you do then your at 1725. The subsequent time period he fought in the war was minimum of 400 linear years, making him roughly 1500-1900 when he regenerated into 9. According to canon, the time frame between 9 and 12 is somewhere in the range of 1100-1200 years. That means he is 2600 minimum, possibly over 3000. My initial estimate of 3500 was incorrect but canon does not support that the 2000 number given by 12 is correct. 

Some of these numbers are in question because even the Doctor states he can't keep track anymore and the forth Doctor claimed that he could be anywhere from 400-1000.

Part of me believes that overall, in the context of their time and the actions taken against their communities, what the PIRA did was *necessary* to force the British Government into a fairer society.

Another part of me admits that a lot of bombings were wrong, a lot of killings were wrong, and a lot seemed driven by hate rather than political motivation. When taking into account this side, I think they went beyond what was needed of them.

Then there's the peaceful resistance vs violent uprising argument.

Personally, in this argument (taking into account the Northern Irish society and government), I think violence was the only option. We all saw what happened to anybody that showed any smidgeon of nationalism back then, we all saw the peaceful protests and what happened them etc etc. It was only through violence that the peaceful solution became possible (this theory is partly responsible for part of me believing the PIRA were justified).

Still, doesn't the fact that customers are buying off touts indicate that they're willing to pay higher prices to see a show than they're willing to admit to? The fact that someone is paying £100 for a £25 ticket indicates the value they place on seeing him is at least £100 or more. If no one wanted to pay £100, the touts would take a massive loss and would be put off trying it again.

I'm not saying it's a great situation for consumers, but that is the reality of the situation - either the face value of tickets must go up, or supply should be increased to counteract this. Plus, live events are hardly a basic necessity that would cause poor people to struggle, it's a luxury good and luxury goods with fixed or limited supply often fall into this pattern.

[Huh!](https://sexperienceuk.channel4.com/the-sexperience-1000#/preferences/self_conscious)

Worried about ""my body shape"": overwhelmingly women. Check.

Worried about ""reaching orgasm too quickly"": overwhelmingly men. Check.

**Worried about ""pleasing my partner"": mostly men!** Right on.

---

Also in the ""kinda makes sense if you think about it but still wasn't expecting it"" category: **fans of the missionary position** are overwhelmingly female, ""girl on top"" fans are mostly male. Both a question of wanting the other to do most of the work?

---

About a third **masturbates at most once every half a year**, or not at all. And that's true for some 45% of women. Damn. Even in the most masturbation-happy age groups (19-34 year old women) it's 37% of them.

To nobody's surprise, metalheads are the biggest wankers, by that metric at least.

---

Also, yes, **BMW and Audi drivers do get more sex** than you do. 44% of 'em have intercourse at least twice a week, vs. 30% of the overall sample.

---

**Worried about cheating?** Don't get involved with people from the Southwest, Wales, East Anglia or Yorkshire &amp; Humberside. Those cheat the most. Especially the ones from Wales. Bored out of their mind I'm guessing.

---

**Fetishes most likely to disappoint you?** Rubber/latex and asphyxiation have the worst proportions between ""have done, would again"" and ""have done, would not again"".

---

Most drugs gangs are Asian, and therefore most abuse easy to report is by Asian perpetrators. I'm actually quite dissapointed with people below me calling for 'kicking people out' or marginalising whole sections of society. What I pointed out was that the UK has a ghetto gang culture, just like many other countries, ours happens to South Asian, for a variety of factors.

The banned acts were already in place in the existing legislature. the outrage isn't about what's been banned, but the medium by which its distributed. The amendment didn't introduce a ban on acts, it introduced a ban on how its distributed. The amendment closes a gap in censorship legislation that a lot of people don't think was there in the first place, don't think is necessary and which doesn't take into account the reality of internet distributed entertainment. The ban doesn't cover media created outside the UK, so there's nothing stopping UK content creators who, up until Dec 1st were legally contributing to the country's economy, but who are now criminals, going abroad and continuing to produce the same content.

the protest isn't about the government newly banning perfectly reasonable, harmless sex acts, because they're not, they're about infringement of private lives, destruction of peoples livelihood. They're about rescinding legislation based on the personal distaste of people who are long dead, and they're protests against a legislating body which is out of touch, not just with current trends of acceptable sexual practice, but of modern distribution methods and the internet in general.

So you're planning to save over £14k a year?

That is not guaranteed. You will also need to pay income tax on this, cover gaps, deal with problem tenants, and pay all repairs. The house also costs money to buy and to sell, as well as maintain.

Any increase in value may be taxed as capital gains.

&gt; Is this a stupid idea? Will it work?

It can work, but should be considered as an extra job with risks.

&gt; I see houses at £70k which charge £500 a month rent.

This is equivalent to an 8.6% return assuming no costs. £500 in repairs per year, and then tax at 20% gives £4400, a roughly 6.5% return. 

You could see that kind of return in the long run in a broad index fund, which you could open today and not have to wait 5 years to get. There would be no buy or sell fees, no repairs and it'd take no time to run.

Liberal democracy is a form of government in which representative democracy operates under the principles of liberalism, i.e. protecting the **rights of the individual**, which are generally enshrined in law. It is characterised by fair, free, and competitive elections between multiple distinct political parties, a separation of powers into different branches of government, the rule of law in everyday life as part of an open society, **and the equal protection of human rights, civil rights, civil liberties, and political freedoms for all persons.**

Within Israel, Arabs have identical legal rights as Jews. They can (and do) hold influential positions across the country. They even have multiple political parties that contest elections (United Arab List, Ta'al, Balad). Meanwhile, Jews are barely tolerated at best in every other country in the region, let alone being allowed equal participation in elections.

The fact that you don't know this basic information just proves my point that it's fashionable to be anti-Israel.

&gt;Israel is a paid-up fully fledged member of the genocidal club. It's marginally less worse than Saudi Arabia, just like Hitler is marginally less worse than Stalin, simply because he murdered fewer people.

Across the entire 50 year long Israeli-Palestinian conflict, there have been 21,500 deaths. Many of these are not civilian. That's not even 2 people a day. If this is an attempt at genocide, then it's the most incompetent attempt at genocide in history. A spree killer could do a better job of genocide.

No. Israel is not attempting genocide. Palestine intended it in 1948 and Hamas continues to demand genocide, but neither side in this conflict is actually carrying out a genocide.",null,0,null,1423164728,null,0,1423165170,0,cocatl5,null,t3_2uvkmn,null,t1_cocatl5,null,t1_cocaluz,null,null,null,1424154149,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Fabio and Daniel had good impacts to the strike force and the author criticizing fab for the shit at the keep should acknowledge the angle he had and how there was no clear option for him in the box to pass to. He actually linked up well with Dan before the shot well and my only criticism for him was he would move more central when we could have had more space in the middle had he stayed on the wing.

Allen is joining a team that has gelled without him present and the midfield is the focal point of our team so could just need taking time to adjust.

Gerrard was a passenger at times but gave great long passes that helped create chances and he was loyal to his defensive duty until hendo came on.

null,false,Tophattingson,null,null,null,"&gt;Have a look at the occupied territories, see how those human rights hold up.

Gaza and West Bank are not Israel. Hence why I was very specific in saying ""Within Israel""

Israel has continually been attempting to create a two-state solution. The two state solution was destroyed by Palestine in 1948 and every attempt to recreate it has been destroyed by various groups within Palestine. It's obvious; Palestine will never accept a two state solution. What, exactly, do you suggest Israel do?

&gt; Even Arab Jews are discriminated against and if you're half as clued up as you purport to be then you will know this. Fuck fashion you insensitive so and so.

I am sure there is discrimination, just as there is discrimination everywhere on the planet. What matters more is if it extends through the entire legal and political system to the point where it leaves them completely powerless. Clearly, the existence of several political parties that hold seats in government is strong evidence that this is not the case. However, this powerless condition applies for Jews in every other country in the Middle East.

&gt;If the best you can do to defend Israel is say ""well they're better than their neighbours"" then it's a damning indictment of an argument considering the region. The whole region is a nightmare in general, do not pretend that Israel are not wholly complicit in the entire quagmire.

I think Israel should do better. I don't know how though. Any solution that doesn't involve the destruction of Israel is unacceptable to the groups that hold influence within Palestine. This is strategically genius; refuse to accept any compromise and let the occupation slowly turn global opinion against Israel, and I don't know any way to counter it other than everyone in the West suddenly gaining a huge amount of knowledge of the context of the conflict.

Israel isn't just better than it's neighbours. It's fucking amazing compared to it's neighbours. By just about every measurable metric Israel has better human rights than all of it's neighbours. Even in Gaza and West Bank, you gain the benefit of not being ruled over by genocidal and democidal dictators (unless Hamas shows up). Even being an Arab anywhere else in the Middle East is dangerous enough.",null,0,null,1423166317,null,0,false,0,cocbsh7,null,t3_2uvkmn,null,t1_cocbsh7,null,t1_cocb517,null,null,null,1424153233,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Probably. But lowering the risk of injury at the cost of reducing cycling doesn't add up because [cycling has strong health benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling#Health_effects), and the risk of injury is small to start with.


[Child cyclist head injuries in England: the wider context](http://www.cyclehelmets.org/1118.html)

[if x people cycle or walk y distance on most days, what is the economic value of mortality rate improvements?](http://www.cyclehelmets.org/1231.html)

I suggest you support http://spaceforcycling.org/uk/ instead.

In a wider context cycling mass cycling (facilitated by infrastructure we largely don't yet have) [can help prevent depression](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/Pages/Exercise-for-depression.aspx) by giving people an opportunity to build more exercise into their day to day lives. It also gives children a lot more freedom.

You essentially have to supply to the point where touts can't turn a profit off buying out the shows and reselling... so as far as I can work it out under the current rules of it all, there's no way to eliminate touting here without selling (or risk not selling, as the case may be) a significant number of seats that won't be occupied.

For example, and I know in reality it wouldn't work this way but it works as a hypothetical, we can see that the tour tickets are 4x the price compared to the original value. This means that a tout only has to sell 1 in 4 purchased tickets to break even, or we can say 1 in 3 to cover operating costs (and I'd imagine that would turn a tidy profit still, I can't imagine their operating costs are too high).

So, how many tickets in total does the theatre have to increase their sales by to make it unreasonable for the touts to sell only a third of the tickets they buy? What if the touts drop the prices significantly?

If Rotherham was a big political correctness conspiracy then why was this same attitude to statutory rape common throughout the whole western world at that time? Why were attitudes to adult rape no different? Shit, it's [still a problem today](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11061904/Police-failing-to-investigate-crimes-says-official-watchdog.html). For the last few decades we've become obsessed with statistics and rape cases have shitty conviction rates so it's in the police's interest to not even record them as crimes. FTA (Aug 2014):

&gt; &gt; Officers allowed their own opinions to cloud their decision-making process over whether a report of rape should actually be recorded as a crime, the inquiry found. 

&gt; &gt; “There is some evidence that issues such as mental health and alcohol dependency can influence the investigative process negatively, and in some instances delay or even stop the recording of a crime. This is not acceptable.” 

&gt; &gt; “Failures were primarily attributed to the interpretation of additional verifiable information, with those victims suffering with mental health, those young of age or intoxicated more likely to receive a poor service,” it said.

&gt; &gt; Simon Danczuk, the Rochdale MP, said: “For some time now I’ve had concerns about Greater Manchester Police not taking rape seriously, particularly when the victims are young, vulnerable and less able to argue their case. 

This is **today**. Most of the victims in Rotherham etc were from disadvantaged kids, many taking drugs and drinking. If the police today are failing them how bad do you think it was back then when even sober adult rape victims with ""respectable"" backgrounds were routinely let down by the legal system?

Please, just think for a moment what you are suggesting. You don't need a ""conspiracy"" to understand why child rape was not prioritized in the same country where ""St Trinians"" passes for family entertainment. 

&gt; doesn't change the facts presented in the links.

What facts? What exactly are you saying here? Why are you listing a tiny selection of the total number of UK child rape cases where the only unifying factor is race? You do realise that it is a huge problem for all cultures? 

What ""fact"" is presented by all of the Catholic school/church/home rapists? Is there some cultural driver there? 

&gt; Ask 24 of your friends if they want to have sex with a 14 year old girl of a different race to you who you have plied with drugs.

What's with the ""of a different race""? You honestly think that was a driver for the behaviour? You do know they also targeted girls of all other backgrounds, it's just that white girls made up the majority of the victims? This isn't some grand cultural domination plan, it's opportunistic predators taking advantage of whatever is available to them. Most of the children in this country where white, particularly those who reside in care homes that have substance abuse issues.

Are you seriously suggesting that child rapists are more ethical if they limit their crimes to their own ethnic community? This is what you actually imply here. 

&gt; I'll accept your premise. 

If such a nonsensical test is the only way to convince you then I'll never do so. 

Why don't you convince me that statutory rape was ruthlessly prosecuted by the police in the UK prior to the year 2000 when the perpetrators where white? Where are the conviction figures?

Sometimes mutual defense deals come in the form of supplying arms as opposed to troops. This prevents global escalation while achieving defensive goals. 

Without conventional weapons, the only way to defend becomes chemical, nuclear, or biological in nature. 

As long as there is demand there WILL be supply. At least with the UK controlling a significant portion of the world's supply there is some regulation and oversight.

To do a proper comparison, you'd have to look at all of the data that admissions tutors do - results in these (at least, the results you have so far, so GCSE and AS results), results of any additional tests (eg. BMAT etc. for medicine, STEP or olympiads for mathematics, university set subject tests ...), performance at interview etc. The interviews will be looking for, among other things, how well you pick things up or apply your knowledge to situations/examples you've not seen before - testing how you learn and can apply your knowledge, which is not something that GCSEs or A levels test.

Interviews aren't ""completely subjective"". Yes, they do rely on academics making judgements, but from what I know everyone will be seen by at least two people (which helps reduce any personal bias on behalf of one interviewer) and it's very rare for their judgements to be that different. Admissions decisions will compare people for the same subject interviewed by different interviewers, so they are used to a shared scale for comparisons. A wider bias is possible, but in many interviews there will be some quantative things that can be directly compared (e.g. in some subjects and colleges you are given questions to look at in a test beforehand and discuss what you did, or get given hints to see if you can learn to do what you didn't manage, in the interview) and the universities to look and note if there is a persistent statistically significant difference in ratios of applications to offers between groups.

But if you are happy then don't worry. Of course there is the possibility, based on your choice of words, that you are NOT happy and you find very minor social interactions difficult.

My advice would be to go somewhere, a quiet town, on a coach and take a book to read on the journey so you don't feel forced to talk to people. No more than a couple of hours away I would say. Go find a coffee shop and sit down and read there. Or maybe find a bench in a park. Heck, use Google maps to find a place where there aren't too many people around and you can sit down in some peace and quiet.

Really?

I was under the impression you were under 30.

Is it not the case *you've been told* ""violence was the only option yada yada"" etc etc. 

I don't think you *saw* at all.

Peaceful protests often turn into confrontation with enforcement agencies. See Poll Tax riots in 1990, student riots in 2010, cairo 2012. From the Boston Bread Riots of the 1710s, to the Toronto G-20 Riots, there's absolutely nothing strange or unusual in a political protest getting hyper-charged and turning into a violent stand-off with the coppers. Its only Northern Ireland that continually likes to imagine itself somehow unique in its experience, and draws out tortured historical victim narratives from it all.

Reasons of course being that a) peaceful protests often contain minorities all up for creating a confrontation with law enforcement agencies and b) some in the law enforcement agencies are always more than up for providing this opportunity. From the 1710s to 2010s, not that much has changed.

Put this in the late 60s context you're referring to, and this scenario was global and prevalent at the time. Marxist-inspired students and youths, with Che Guevera posters on their bedroom walls, kicking off with the police. The police fighting back in a way that was never going to flatter them. Negative press pictures created. The youth revulsion extenuated. The conditions for revolution helpfully forwarded (ala the classic trotskyist militancy tactics - textbook). All the future ammunition for sappy feel-sorry-for-yourself Ken Loach films you need.

Derry and Belfast 1968/9 have to be seen in the context of Washington DC, Chicago, Louisville, Belgrade, Prague 1968/9. The hippy youth movement was making way for a more strident late baby boomer generation, well up for a militant approach to taking on establishments.

However, a protest (however noble or not its intent) that turns into a violent confrontation with the peelers does not a case for 40 years of bombing, shooting and mayhem make.

If so Fulton Missouri's in for problems. Tottenham and the Paris Banlieue too. Not to mention Cairo, Bahrain and Stockholm.

An historical revisionist project by political parties in the present trying to make their past smell less like shit...(*""we're weren't really about achieving a united Ireland by violence alone, despite all our statements at the time - we were all about civil liberties, honest"") - that's possible.

null,false,pcjonathan,smith,Smith,null,"BTW, a couple of years ago, Craig Ferguson asked ""Who here has ever illegally downloaded an episode of Doctor Who"" at the Doctor Who Comic Con panel. By far, the vast majority put their hands up. These are the same people who cosplay, purchase comic con tickets and wait for many hours on end for the fandom. 

I'm, on the most part, OK with it. A good proportion of serials are not available commercially and to purchase the classics comes to a phenomenal amount. But unless you have special sources, most of these will be fairly low or average quality so people who purchased it get the top quality.

Piracy is also a major contribution towards some further income. Why? Because generally, a pirate who pirates is *not* a lost sale, but rather a sale that would never have happened.

Meanwhile, a lot of people run off a ""try before you buy"" concept. A lot of people who like things they've pirated will go on to purchase the episodes.

But it's really their own fault for not having a decent platform for this! Take [this](https://torrentfreak.com/bbc-fact-shut-down-doctor-who-fansite-140823/) for instance. The site's main purpose was to cater to people who couldn't get Who any other way! A global legal cheap platform should be fairly easy for this.

Edit: Actually, something a friend said since posting this persuaded me to add this little personal reason as to why it contributes as to why I'm OK with it.

If I didn't pirate my first Doctor Who series off Kazaa nearly 10 years ago now, I would not have been given hope in life, which prevented me from committing suicide, something which I've mentioned previously on this sub (oh, and contributing &gt;£100 towards things like DVDs, etc, but that's fairly irrelevant). This is actually a contributing factor to starting up that Doctor Who streaming site, which took time and money. Because I felt that if it could save a single life in the way that the show saved mine, then it would have been worth it.

Difference was that company was structured around that situation so it all felt above board and I never felt unsafe, help was always a phonecall away. Incidentally, one time somebody actually DID follow me into the building, and the police had to be called. 

This is going to sound super paranoid, but it's not just the potential for someone getting into the building that I'm worried about (although that really does worry me, I'm female but I'd also be concerned for my male colleagues.) I'm also concerned if a situation arose where - for example - something went missing or breaks or whatever and I (or whoever is on that shift) get blamed/accused/called in to question because I'm the only one in the office. 

Thanks for bringing up unsocial hours pay, I'll look into that. :)

null,false,BCMM,null,null,null,"Not everybody can be vaccinated (immunocompromised people, people with allergies to ingredients used in the production of the vaccine, etc.), and not everybody who is vaccinated develops full immunity.

When a disease is introduced in to a region that was previously free of it, one of two things happens:

1. Each infected person infects an average of *more than one* other person before they die/get better. The number of infected people grows exponentially.

2. Each infected person infects an average of *less than one* other person before they die/get better. The number of infected people decreases until the region is disease-free again.

So, the way to prevent epidemics happening is to reduce the number of susceptible people an infected person has contact with. You can simply reduce the number of people an infected person meets; closing schools and so on helps, but is obviously undesirable; quarantining might help if the disease is easy to detect. Or you can reduce the number of people that are susceptible, using vaccination.

In practice, there are a number of factors out of the control of health authorities, like how many people an average person meets each day and how likely they are to transmit the disease if one of those people is susceptible to it. One can estimate a threshold of people that must be immune in order ensure that situation 2. prevails, and for some diseases, that allows some margin for the people who can't be made immune, but doesn't allow a great deal more.

When there are enough vaccinated people around to bring about situation 2, the unvaccinated/ineffectively vaccinated are protected by ""herd immunity"" - they are highly unlikely to to exposed to the disease. If an anti-vaccination campaign take the number of non-immune people over that threshold, it can cause an outbreak that affects people who did not choose to avoid vaccination. Outbreaks due to vaccine refusal have actually actually happened; even in countries with high levels of vaccination, because anti-vaccination parents tend to exist in clusters, causing situations where a single school in an otherwise sensible city is above the threshold.",null,0,null,1423173377,null,0,1423244631,0,cocfo8k,null,t3_2uv3yh,null,t1_cocfo8k,null,t1_cobzatq,null,null,null,1424149546,null,4,false,BritishSuccess,t5_2vlyo,4,null

Are you sure yours hasn't recently ticked over to 5 digits?

My advice, be very sure before you submit it online. It took me weeks to get confirmation it was an error, took about 8 weeks to correct it. I had to go through citizens advice to speak to a real person at scottish power - waiting times through the normal lines were hours long, emails went unanswered. I even had a visit from a collections company because it was such a large overdue amount. 

They never updated me. Eventually they sent a correct bill though and I'm glad to have closed my account now.

null,false,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,null,"Integration of systems, testing, avionics, time.

Ultimately, the Panavia Tornado was designed to be a air interdiction (that is, deep strike) low altitude high speed aircraft. From it's inception it was designed to be an aircraft which would fly very fast, very close to the ground, drop munitions, fight its way out, and come home. It was always designed with this mission in mind, designed to drop bombs and fire air to ground missiles.

The Eurofighter was designed with a very different purpose in mind. It's a highly manoeuvrable high altitude air superiority fighter. It was designed to fight not behind enemy lines but at the front line, destroying Su-27's and Mig-29's in order to ensure that the front line was our space, not theirs. Aircraft have radars specifically for air, or for ground. Even where radars can be dual purpose, they require a lot of software and integration with other systems to enable them to do what they weren't built for.

Give me a Eurofighter 20 years after introduction and give me a Tornado 20 years after introduction and the former will almost inevitably be a far superior multirole aircraft. However the Typhoon is not there yet. The Eurofighter goes almost as fast as the Tornado, weighs less, flies further, handles *far* better, can supercruise, carries almost as many tonnes of munitions but can carry more individual munitions. The Tornado was designed to defend itself from threats if required, the Typhoon was designed to *be* a threat, and on top of this, with good air to ground integration will do everything the Tornado did.

But every time you want to stick a new weapon on an aircraft you need to ensure that the aircraft and weapon can talk to each other, and that the aircraft knows what it's doing with that weapon. Dumb bombs might just be a case of the aircraft needing to have an understanding of basic physics, but what about, say, an anti-tank missile? The aircraft first needs to be programmed to be able to pick up tanks as targets. This means the radar and other sensors aboard need to be configured to actually be able to pick up the heat, shape, and general profile of a tank. 

Then the aircraft needs to be able to establish a lock on this target, and know what kind of missiles it can and can not be allowed to fire at the target. Once all this is done, the aircraft then needs to know what the ranges of its capable missiles are, how to program them prior to launch to attack that target, and how to communicate with the missile while in flight, if required, to update telemetry. What sort of data does the missile need from the aircraft? Radar? Which type, what bands? Infrared? Television? 

This stuff is not simple, in fact, this stuff is the most complicated there is in modern fighter aircraft. With an F-15E, an aircraft which first flew 28 years ago, the avionics package costs about 70-80% of the total aircraft cost.

The short answer to your question is that what makes the Eurofighter less suitable to to A2G than the Tornado is that the Eurofighter isn't really finished as a ground attack aircraft. If we were buying it as one then we probably would make the manufacturing company work on it for another 3-5 years before buying it. However what we bought was essentially a work in progress which was already a superb air superiority platform, arguably the second best in the world, but which was immature in terms of air to ground attack capabilities.

It's immensely cruel to deny them the opportunity to enjoy our freedom because of an accident of birth. 

Immigrants from the Caribbean were sought out and indeed welcomed in a time of labour shortage, before being reviled later when times got tougher. Just take a look at who is cleaning your hospital next time you're in. 

But my point was that we are all immigrants, even if, no doubt the brutal Romans and Normans were not welcomed. 

On the effects of labour on the economy, there is a myth that a fixed pile of jobs is available to all and that immigrant labour takes away our jobs. But jobs exist because of demand for goods, which in turn exists because people spend money. Immigrants spend money too, and thus stimulate demand and create jobs. How much is unclear, but by working cheaply, they tend to provide cheap goods for those of us fortunate enough to enjoy the luxury of minimum wage, so the net effect is not clear, and the vulgar, racist attitude towards foreign workers is quite independent of any open and honest economic assessment.

So you're right, in that Rafa is more tactical. He will change the lineup every week based on the opposition that he's playing against. Rodgers relies on having superior technical attackers to beat the opposition. Rafa, much like Mourinho and like Simeone, see the game as almost 2 v 1. Overlaps and crowding was used to great effect. Rodgers isn't like that. He's a 1 v 1 coach. Can you dribble? Are you comfortable with the ball? Can you pass and receive a ball under pressure? Those are aspects of Rodgers' idea. Rodgers will put the shape of the team out according to our strengths and availability, not necessarily to the strengths and shape of the opposition.

So yes, Rafa thinks a lot more tactically then Rodgers. But if football was a game of individual battles, Rodgers would be right up there. Unfortunately, it isn't!

Rafa's team only had 1 title charge? Why? Because we got the final piece of the puzzle in Torres in 2009. Rafa's image was fully shown. Rafa had everything he wanted and everything was set for him. Rodgers has yet to have that. The team is young. And when Rodgers get wiser and more savvy, and when the team gains more experience, then we can compare a Rodgers vs Rafa side. It's just too early to compare the 2. In fact, it's a testament to Rodgers' coaching that he's being compared to Rafa when Rodgers has had a lot of things go against him much like Rafa did financially.

That Rafa team, in my opinion, knows how to win and knows how to win big matches. Rodgers will get there some day. I'm sure of it. But for now, that Rafa team would beat Rodgers' team (Mourinho style).

plundering helped us, but i think the main thing that allowed us this level of luxury is that we defended ourselves for so long that our societies could develop to the point of the enlightenment, which paved the way for the economic and political systems which have facilitated our wealth. 

i'd say the reason that plundering is considered wrong in the first place is because europeans came to dominate the world for a time and spread our views and culture, including the kind of christian ""pity the weak and humble"" view that i'd say is the predecessor of the modern social justice way of thinking. if china say had become the worlds dominant power and their culture had spread, would it still be viewed as bad? people tend to view everything through that liberal democratic humanist lense as if it was universal, forgetting that it's pretty exclusively a western way of looking at the world, i doubt we'd get the same treatment if things had gone otherwise.

anyway letting in such amounts of immigrants by being so welcoming sets us up for sizeable minorities in the foreseeable future who dont share that culture. you like humanism, but islamists for example really dont and in setting up a large bloc of people of that culture in this country you risk destabilising that pillar which ideologies like humanism rest on.

as for skills gaps, pensions etc, that in my opinion is a massive cop out by the government who should be fixing the structural problems in the welfare system and education to create a long term fix, rather than slapping on plasters, throwing more immigrants at the problem, which simply puts off dealing with the problem of sustainability and creates a ponzi scheme as it were.",null,0,null,1423177085,null,0,false,0,cochuj2,null,t3_2uvob3,null,t1_cochuj2,null,t1_cocgeu4,null,null,null,1424147482,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Either way your employee can't change you to shifts without your agreement (after 12 weeks of working set hours it's implied to be your contractual hours), but if you did want to refuse it'd obviously be easier if your contract says it outright. Bear in mind that if you refuse outright to change your shifts the company may be able to make you redundant. 

Definitely talk to your employer about being the sole person in the building. That's a bad idea for a number of reasons. Some measures you could request are 1) an on call security guard 2) installation of panic buttons linked to the police/a security company or 3) a company policy that there will be two people on site at any one time. 

There are benefits to working different shifts, and as you're not entirely against it you'll be in a better bargaining position as you can come across as making reasonable requests.

Note: merely.

I'm glad you don't think people should be ""penalised"" for ""holding certain views"". You've finally come round to my want of thinking.

Of course, penalties there most certainly are: name calling (extremist), the averted gaze, ridicule, and academic opprobrium leading to diminished prospects. If you don't know that your views are withing the narrow limits of acceptability so you've never had to push and the real but subtle walls surrounding you.

Fortunately, they don't yet lock you up, although for some time academic authorities have responded to solicitations from the state to report ""domestic extremists"", whatever they are. Certainly not people very good with vacuum cleaners. In some cases this has undoubtedly lead to imprisonment under terrorism suspicions.

We had to prosecute our neighbour for using his stereo to it's fullest potential at all hours of the day and night (and we won and he lost all of his audio equipment and was fined substantially, so do be careful). The council will provide clear guidance on decibal levels and times when music or audio noise to a certain level is acceptable. 

For DIY and normal household noise the rules are usually very clear and fair, too.  

I'm not saying that this is the case with you, but my SO and I work night shifts, so if I finally get to sleep at midday to go to work at 11pm or 2:40 am at night, I get a bit cranky, too if there's a lot of noise. Where I live, there is no DIY allowed on a sunday. 

I'd suggest approaching your neighbours kindly and discussing the situation with them once you've found out what the rules are within your local council. 

Edit: We have to deal with a certain amount of noise, even though we do shift work because we sleep when most people are awake, but I do expect my neighbours to be respectful and aware of noise levels.

Neither of those things sound like two people having sex.

The way you make it sound, though, is like the police went in to clear the place like an overenthusiastic SWAT team, shooting pepper spray just for the sake of it.

If they pepper sprayed people, it would be because the people in question were being aggressive/violent/forceful.

Mason should be slotted here next to Bentaleb (their partnership has been strong for most of the season). Dembele has been strong behind the striker but Eriksen is at his best in that position, so I would be against slotting him in at Right Winger. I assume that Dembele will come in as a sub for either Townsend or Chadli later in the match and Eriksen will move over to the wing. I think that Lamela is a less effective sub, so if he doesn't start, he probably will not play.

I'm in Bowland Basic Ensuite, and it does the job. Given that I'm saving a fair chunk of money on it, I don't mind it. Admittedly, it's older, but it's functional, if there are problems, they're usually fixed pretty quickly (I've put in a report at 3am before and had someone come at 10am to fix it).

However, since the whole Ukraine fiasco kicked off, Russia has put a lot of resources into winning the 'propaganda war' with the West. Read virtually any Guardian article related to Putin, Russia, or Ukraine between late 2013 - present. Some commenters are genuine Putin sympathisers, e.g. the kind of people who might be Socialist Party activists or regularly attend anti-Nato marches etc.

However most of the absurd pro-Russia comments on Western news sites are from people in Russia who are paid to write them. This isn't some top secret conspiracy - it's widely known and acknowledged. Generally it involves uneducated and unemployed Russians answering an advert in a newspaper or on social media. In Moscow there are sites used to house computers where people have a quota to write a certain number of comments or Tweets a day.

Bots are also widely used on social media to churn out anti-Ukraine content. [Have a look at this link](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%D0%BD%D0%BE%20%D0%BC%D1%8B%20%D0%B1%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BC%20%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8C%20%D0%B8%20%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B6%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%20%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B8%20%D0%B7%D0%B0%20%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5&amp;src=typd) which shows hundreds of the same Tweets welcoming the Russian 'rebels' bombing of civilians recently.

The Nottingham case, if that is true, is stupid. But then freedom of speech is not something that is hugely protected in the UK.

Ridicule and name calling, as you surely know, happen in college for all sorts of reasons. Clearly other students can have negative reactions to views and you can find examples of name calling for things far more frivolous than someone's considered viewpoint. This isn't evidence of institutional bias, more young people being arseholes.

Academic opprobrium is only of relevance when you are submitting academic work. It is about the quality of argument and not always what you say. I am sure we can find examples of tutors marking stuff down they do not agree with though. Heck I know someone who has to revisit the premise of their PhD thesis because their supervisor disagreed with it, although it was arguable either way.

&gt; I'm glad you don't think people should be ""penalised"" for ""holding certain views"". You've finally come round to my want of thinking.

I wouldn't find this typo so funny if you weren't trying to twist what I said to mean something else. But for the record I don't think you have a want of thinking.

In other words, they want to see initiative, some sort of world experience, an interest to learn and creativity.

Things that can help you stand out are work experience in a relevant field, or competing in sport at high level, or performing academic work at a level higher than would normally be expected.

Unfortunately, such systems can be gamed. If you are rich and middle class, with plenty of contacts - you can find a suitable internship for your son/daughter; you can find a sports club with a decent coach, and afford to pay the club fees, transport costs, etc.; you can help with learning projects, or find someone who needs some help (maybe an academic colleague who needs some data entry help).

If your family is poor, or parents are unwilling or unable to help with advanced school work, or have no contacts in relevant fields - then it is much more difficult to make yourself stand out.

To take this to absurdity - if Oxford were to make it an entry requirement that students must have blonde hair; which specific demographic is going to be buying up all the peroxide?

Let me put this to you though. I think the point you make regarding Dembele's skillset, its limitations, and its origins is interesting and a fair assessment of what we've seen to date.  

However, I think there is reason to be optimistic, and simply because decisiveness is something I believe can be taught.  Dembele needs to learn the game more. And we've got reason to believe that Poch seems to know his shit.

If Dembele learns where to move, the sort of passes he should expect and look to play, as well as learning the spaces and positions he's likely to find himself in, he will gain confidence and mental surety. From Panic and over-thinking, you'll get a more natural, calm execution. At least, we can hope.

With regards to passing, I think his technique is better than perhaps you give him credit for--in cases of short interplay especially.  As for shooting--he's pretty shit really, isn't he.  But again, he can improve.

Once you've attached the blocks of insulation you would have to either cover it in a few secured layers of fabric, think futon covers, or box it in with a frame and some thin sheets of plywood. **This is because the dust that comes of the insulation is an irritant**.

It depends on what your abilities are and what your budget is.  

You can then take it down when you move out.


Also research sound insulation. It may not solve your problem as the noise might be traveling a different route i.e through the floor joists, out the window, through the ceiling.

For this discussion, I think the more complete answer is that both teams played some of the most incredible football I've been able to witness as a Liverpool fan, and I think they were equally strong teams (as evidenced by their respective title challenges). I think Rafa's team was better in knock-out/European style competitions. Rodgers' team was probably better in the Premier League format (with its ability to blow anyone, including top 4 contenders, off the pitch). 

Additionally, I echo the other comments in saying that the team that gave last year's team the biggest fits was Chelsea, who played it exactly like Rafa's Liverpool would have (or how other elite cagey European opposition hypothetically would have).

Honestly, I think I will ultimately ""like"" Rodgers' 13-14 team better-- it won the judge's score.

I really, truly, sincerely, honestly could not disagree more. When I first started frequenting this sub, there was loads of talk about how Lucas *needed* to be moved on, because he didn't have the quality to make it at LFC. With how he's been performing, I doubt any of them would still say the same.



Has Balotelli disappointed so far? I think that's fair to say. But to already be so certain he's moving on is excessively reactionary. Yes, he was poor when he first started for us, but the whole team was shit at the time, and while it would have been fantastic for him to have been the one to lift us up, that is a lot to ask of a new signing.

Then the War Doctor stated he was 800.

Basically I think the Doctor doesn't know so he makes it up, he has definitely stopped counting properly by the time the 12th Doctor comes along but all we know is that roughly he's over 2000 years old now.

Other theories could be that he gives his age relative to whatever year he is in, or he sometimes calculates it based on the length of a year on the planet he is on (which could explain the 7th Doctor being 953 if that planet had a shorter orbit) or maybe he sometimes calculates it in Gallifrey years rather than Earth years.

He definitely does have some magic when he gets closer to the goal (at least with his passes- the finishing still needs improvement despite the wonder goal the other day) but it seems to manifest itself more often when he's charging in from farther back rather than receiving the ball closer to the goal. 

In the long term, I could see him being the most forward of a midfield three with Henderson (most box-to-box) and Can (most defensive, in theory). I think it would be well-balanced, as Coutinho can cover for Henderson somewhat and Hendo and Can can cover for each other when either pushes forward. Then we have a front three of Sterling, Sturridge, and Markovic/Ibe with Lallana able to switch in for either of the wingers or Coutinho.

Where did they tell you to follow roadsigns too and did you end up there. If so you might be able to retrace your steps on google maps. 

This is a bit cheeky but what you could do is is hang round near the test centre, speak with instructors (ask them about their training school, lessons and blah then ask about the test routes), see which directions those who are on test move off on, and see where instructors take their pupils. 
Othe than that, take your time. They expect you to be a bit nervous and so on, so don't rush into things.

We're discussing the distinction between 1 year and lifetime restrictions on MSM blood donation. Saying 'they're banned too' is a lazy obfuscation of the issue.

&gt; Not really, tattoos can easily be checked if they've happened in teh past year. MSM is impossible.

Here's something which might surprise you: You can't easily confirm if a man has ever had sex with a man, or with a woman infected with HIV, or if they've ever used injected drugs, or worked as a prostitute, or received a blood donation, or traveled in areas where infectious diseases are epidemic. 

The whole system of rules on who can donate is based on trust (backed up by screening), and designed with actual risk groups in mind. The possibility that someone might lie applies equally across all variants of MSM rules, and is not a substantive argument against reducing the exclusion period by itself. 

Indeed, there is actually some evidence (referenced in the SABTO report) that MSM may be more likely to comply with a time-period restriction than an absolute ban. As non-compliance with delay periods is one of the main mechanisms by which infected blood can be passed into the system, a less strict rule about MSM donation may actually reduce risk of infected HIV transmission.",null,0,null,1423189685,null,0,false,0,cocol18,null,t3_2uuwdo,null,t1_cocol18,null,t1_cocnnle,null,null,null,1424140557,null,4,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,4,null

If you are getting dry patches when you don't care for your skin and oiliness when you do, one or more of your products is likely overly harsh and causing irritation. The obvious culprit is the granular scrub.

Your toner can be used as a 'light cleanse' in the morning, if you want to do a little more that just water but don't need a full cleanse. For evening many here are fans of oil cleansing using commercial oil blends that contain emulsifiers (product rinses clean with water). I use a muslin cloth alongside for an extra clean feeling and a little gentle exfoliation. 

For sebaceous filaments generally a BHA exfoliant is recommended, however they can be very drying. I have found making my entire routine moisturising from cleansing out leaves the skin plumped which heps makes pores look tiny. TBH I do still use an extractor, tho I do not press down on individual 'clogs' (can be damaging) but rather scrape the side of the loop gently over a whole area of skin.

For acne control consider consulting your family doctor - they can prescribe anti inflammatory topicals such as 4% niacinamide or 15%/ 20% azelaic acid. These are often both more effective and gentler than cosmetic products. Other options include cosmetic products containing niacinamide, sodium ascorbyl phosphate or a retinoid (see our Wiki and the mega reviews, vitamin C is next up).

In spring through autumn consider adding a physical sunscreen based on zinc oxide, this is naturally anti microbial so will help control breakouts without the need for acne products, many of which are overly harsh. Also clean your glasses daily with alcohol.

Last thought is to take a look at your diet and lifestyle choices, ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle. At the end of the day skin is our largest organ and it is likely to be in the best health when treated well inside and out. At this time of year oily fish  is particularly important for vitamin D and long chain omega-3s. Experts recommend up to four servings a week.",null,0,null,1423192870,null,0,1423193208,0,cocq7r7,null,t3_2uxj0v,null,t1_cocq7r7,null,t3_2uxj0v,null,null,null,1424138742,null,3,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,3,null

The theory goes that the writers wanted to add tension to the show by revealing that Tom Baker's Doctor was the character's final regeneration, which is supported by the dialogue in the scene.  By adding the faces in The Brain of Morbius to the number of known bodies at the point the episode was aired you reach twelve or thirteen (I can't remember off the top of my head).  A few serials later, they added the twelve-regeneration limit.  However, the revelation that Four was the last one never occurred and the show proceeded on normally.

What you said about the scrub actually makes a lot of sense, I'll look into finding something better.

I have used my toner as a cleanser in the morning and it works really well. I'll continue to do that. Muslin cloths, that's what they're called! I also prefer some exfoliation so I'll make a note of that. What kind of oil would work best? 

I've heard of BHA and to be honest, I don't think my routine is well enough to reduce the look of my pores currently so I'll probably try out some of that. I was unfortunately pressing down on individual 'clogs' as you describe them but that's a good tip. I'm too much of a perfectionist so I don't usually stop until I get everything out.

I want to try to see if my 'acne' will sort itself out using a good routine, I feel like I have a normal amount of breakouts considering I don't religiously cleanse and look after my skin but once I start to, if I doesn't fix itself, I'll go see my doc. 

Ah, I've not heard of 'anti-microbial' sunscreens, I'll have to get myself some of that! I use anti bacterial soap to clean my glasses, just lather up, rinse and dry but need to do it more frequently. 

I like the last tip, I'm probably not eating as well as I should and don't always remember to drink enough water so thank you :) You've been very helpful!
