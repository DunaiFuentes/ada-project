Low minimum wages is as much a result of the economy as a whole as it is a decision on the part of a business. If there are too many people going for low skilled jobs, this pushes wages down in that part of the employment market.

2 things now happen:


1. You let out the flat and make a monthly income relative to the full value of the flat (e.g. £96k) minus your mortgage payments. Likely a profit of around £200 per month with an interest only mortgage with payments, insurances, service charges and agents fees deducted. 


2. The flat will increase in value over time relative to full £96k. The bank only ever wants their original loan back plus interest. So if the value goes up 10% (e.g. £9,600) you get all £9,600. 


Things to consider:


Tax. 2 types, income and capital gains. 


20% income tax is due on all of your rental income, less the interest on the mortgage payments. The £200pcm assumes interest only mortgage, so that is the taxable amount. However you pay this only after you have personally made ~£10,000 in a year.


Capital gains tax is only applicable when you sell the property, 20% of the amount the property has increased in value, however again with an addition allowance on the first £10,000.


The property value can go down, however very unlikely.


The tenants could be a nightmare, so use a good agent and never have to deal with them. (Costs around £60 a month)


For a flat, service charge / ground rent / sinking fund need to be paid too - around £75 a month.

I feel entirely British and I love being British. I've never wanted to live anywhere outside of Britain, I love Wales, England and Scotland (sorry Irelands, I barely know you) and I can't understand people who emigrate to Spain or Asia or Dubai or whatever.

&gt;Do you feel that you've not faced discrimination and that ""white Brits"" consider you to be just as British as them? 

Yes and no. I'm proud of my heritage so when I was at school I used to have lots of 'I hate all pakis but you're different' or 'all asians are gross, obviously you're not'. And people who just see me in the street and don't know me who have shouted racist stuff at me obviously don't know how British I am (or care).

&gt;And how closely do you keep the links to your parents' cultures/homelands? + Where are your parents from?

My mum is ethnically Malay and my dad is ethnically Indian but currently living in Malaysia. They made a real effort not to tell me much about my heritage so that I grew up really British and fit in - I seriously speak posher than most of my peers so I used to get some shit for that! Also, because it was a real taboo that my parents of two different religions got together, I think they didn't want reminding of it all. Now we're all older and my dad is back in Asia, I love learning about Malay stuff and have taken language courses.

&gt; do you consider yourself to be British first, or English/Welsh/Scot/NIrish first or from wherever you are (Londoner, Mancunian, Scouse etc) first?

Funny, I used to consider myself English first but then I married a Welshman and we are now a civilised British house...apart from when sports are on TV!",null,0,null,1428256901,null,0,false,0,cq23tqd,null,t3_31j7sq,null,t1_cq23tqd,null,t3_31j7sq,null,null,null,1432211329,null,7,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,7,null

At the school we were treated more like children. We still had to call teachers by their last names. But at the college it was all done using first names.

The timetables were very different. The school 6th from was split over two schools. So I had each class twice a week, once for a whole morning and once for a whole afternoon. And the times were the same as the school, so 9-3.30. At the college, we had each class 4 times a week. 3 of the lessons were an hour long and one was an hour and a half. On monday and tuesday we finished at 4, but otherwise, times were the same as at school. At both places, we got wednesday afternoon off. So people taking only 3 subjects at the schools would get a whole morning and afternoon off each week. At the college the timetable was split into blocks, so like i said each block had a slot 4 out of 5 days. And there were 6 blocks in total. So free periods would usually be more spread out so you'd get a free hour or two most days, depending on what blocks your lessons were in.  

A lot of people would have house parties or go out clubbing for their 18th/19th birthday as we can drink at that age. 

I knew a few friends who had jobs during sixth form. But 6th forms usually recommend that you don't work more than 10 hours a week. In the paperwork we signed before starting they said that if they knew you had a job and you weren't doing well at 6th form then they'd have a meeting with you and you'd possibly have to give up either 6th form or your job or keep the job and self study and pay to be a private candidate.

Sure I've provided anecdotes. But if you'd like to go and find statistics of what is a notoriously hard issue to simplify into numbers such as social mobility, be my guest. I did look, but found nothing aside from a channel4 blog calling the 60s the ""golden generation of social mobility"". You've provided jot a shred of evidence aside from 1 meaningless statistic (that was an estimate at best) of a grammar school near you. 

Those in grammar schools do better than those in comprehensives of the same ability at age 11. Why? Because they're not dragged down by the kids at the bottom. 

I've experienced both first hand. (Oh another anecdote so it doesn't count, but having family who work in education, it's not just my experience). At a comprehensive the focus is on getting the D students to get Cs to boost their ""A-star to C"" rating &amp; percentages and pushing them up the league tables. The top students who are on for solid As are forgotten about almost entirely. At a grammar school, they push the top kids to not only get A-stars, but 100%. Because everyone is much closer in ability, the A/B borderline students are able to work with the A-star students because the gap isn't as big. And they *are* aided by that. 

But no kid who struggles to understand basic arithmetic will be helped by a kid who can already do advanced calculus. They'll just become disillusioned either through jealousy or frustration, get disruptive and affect the learning of everyone in the class.

**Price of product:** 1,800 Yen for 3g (approx. £10)

**Where did you purchase:** Rakuten JP, but it's no longer listed under direct shipping to the UK

**Product claims:** (being lazy) gist of the product is a powder sunscreen top up to soak up sebum and shine while minimising the appearance of your pores.

**About you:** Combo dehydrated skin, prone to diet related break outs, sensitive to exfoliants, fair to medium skin tone that tans and doesn't burn.

**Your opinion:** 

**WARNING** do not use this on it's on, it's not designed for that and you won't get anywhere near SPF 50+/PA++++ protection if you do!

This is a light pink powder with a spongey puff applicator attached and you apply it like a salt/pepper shaker; take spongey stabs at your face and hope for the best. It will leave that white powdery look and isn't recommended for anyone darker than your generic lighter south east asian skin tone.

It does sort of minimise the appearance of pores, but any finishing powder does that really, this just comes with the sense of security that even if you've dabbed some suncream protection away you're patting on some powder to compensate.

The puff is rather unsanitary of course and washing it means leaving the product without a lid while you do.

Overall, this is pretty gimmicky to me.

null,false,Dev__,null,null,null,"The idea of a UI fascinates economists in the South. In fact they're fascinated by the joining or separating of any states because it's a good opportunity to compare and contrast I suppose. How the economy performs is a matter for what type of United Ireland emerges as well. It will perform differently if it's a devolved government under a confederate Ireland composed of two entities than a federal one. 

From what I've gathered the plan in the event of the UI is basically do what we did to the Republics economy - drop tax rates and make them transparent for everyone - educate everything that moves, negotiate with the EU for structural funds to upgrade necessary infrastructure. The focus of a lot of this attention is the Dublin Belfast corridor because its densely populated with people with education and money giving us a strong eastern seaboard on which to grow a litany of companies. 

The second focus is that Northern Ireland has cheaper land and lower wages, there will emerge a swapping migration pattern, as workers move to the south to avail of higher paying jobs and businesses located in the South move north to avail of cheaper wages and buildings. Again the Dublin Belfast corridor becomes the obvious focal point as setting up here gives compromised access to both. 

Too many jobs in Northern Ireland are with the public sector, this will be reduced in a UI but at least those are made redundant will have decent unemployment benefit to look forward to rather the low amount in Britain. The reduction of the Civil Service will be painful but it will help ease the massive yearly deficit that it costs to run NI. 

Currently NI contributes to military defence spending of the UK which is quietly large by European standards (2% of GDP) - Irish defence forces are quite small as they're mostly for peacekeeping missions and patrolling the coasts. We only spend 0.5% of GDP.

The weirdest thing is the biggest loser in all this is probably the Republic and yet thats the entity that wants a United Ireland the most. Northern Ireland will gain a bit more than it loses and the UK simply wins the most and yet they've the fewest supporters for a United Ireland. There seems to be a weird paradox here.

Repeat after me: anecdotes are not evidence. Oh, and yeah, my family work in education, too, big-whoopdy-doo that makes such a difference to my argument.

You're still focussed on what happens to kids in grammar schools and in comprehensives. You seem very keen to ignore everything that happens in their first eleven years, and also haven't said anything about those who go to the second-tier schools instead.

&gt; I don't understand how you can possibly say they're socially divisive either. Most grammar schools have a much higher proportion of ethnic minorities compared to average. Surely that's cohesive?

Before answering that, I'd want to see the breakdown of various ethnic backgrounds, how it compares with other schools serving the same area, and how it correlates to free school meals.

Also, how do you know Courtois doesn't play a similar style of keeping as Neuer? Sure, we don't play like Bayern, but that doesn't mean Courtois doesn't play in a similar fashion as Neuer. And, if it works, why not try it, you can make the style your own, it's called learning. Also, lastly Courtois isn't known for his positioning, that's Cech's territory. Courtois is known for his reflexes, distribution, and command in set-pieces. If we go by ""Courtois's style"", then doing what he did is quite normal and it is not even necessarily wrong. Lastly back to the argument, I still don't see how being in the semicircle outside of the box is wrong when we were in the opposition 1/3. If you take the shot into perspective, Hazard got fouled (not called) and 2s later Adam shot the ball. Perhaps, Courtois could've moved back faster, but that isn't necessarily the ""right"" play. If Adam were to does a straight defense cutting through ball, then Courtois will be in the perfect position to clear it.

Broadly speaking, there are two choices to make

* Easy Access vs Fixed Term 

You can get a better rate if you're willing to commit to not touching the money you deposit for a period of several years. Best rates go to fixed periods of ~5 years, but the amount *extra* you get compared to only committing to, let's say 2 years, generally isn't huge, and rates could rise before the end of the fixed term (which you'd then miss out on being able to take advantage of).

* Regular Saver vs ... not one of those 

Some accounts offer a higher rate for small regular deposits; they can afford to do that because they put limits on how much you can deposit, so there won't be too much of a balance for them to pay interest on. Also there's typically a date where it ""matures"" into an ordinary (non-""regular saver"") ISA, at which point the rate drops off substantially; they're hoping you'll forget or not bother to move on to a better account at that point.
***
The best rate I'm seeing for easy-access is 1.5%, which you can get from NS&amp;I or the Post Office. But it may well be worth checking your local Building Society just in case they have something better (lots of them do, but they're often restricted to people living in particular post codes, or de-facto limited by requiring you to go into a branch to apply).

HSBC have a 1-year regular saver for deposits of £25-250/month paying 4%, or 6% if you already hold the right type of account with them, which seems pretty perfect for what you described; although it wouldn't allow you to move up to a higher amount than £250/month.

Or if you have a 1-2-3 account from Santander (which could be worth getting; they pay good interest and they're even better if you pay your council tax and utility bills by direct debit) then they have a 2-year fixed ISA at 2%. Or Metro Bank and Virgin Money both pay 2% for a 3 year fix without further conditions.

Those would be the accounts I'd look at first. Rates for Cash ISAs are not all that great at the moment though.",null,0,null,1428258911,null,0,1428259256,0,cq24vui,null,t3_31iosf,null,t1_cq24vui,null,t3_31iosf,null,null,null,1432211898,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

All the British. Much as I enjoy the ability to easily holiday (I get a lifelong visa whatsit) in a different country with a completely different culture, I'd never want to live in that mess of a country. I love it here. The weather is perfect. The people are great. The countryside. London. Yorkshire. &lt;3

I also get shit for speaking like a posh twat, so there's that. I can do Yorkshire for when I go home to my pub though.

&gt;Do you feel that you've not faced discrimination

Not in any meaningful way, no. I mean, you get the people who are just wankers (and in my experience they're far and few between), but no one important to me either personally or professionally has ever said anything. I'm pretty easy going about joking about things like race, so maybe that helps. ([Compulsory song reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RovF1zsDoeM)).

I've also never had any trouble from ""the authorities"". Never been stopped and searched, which is pretty surprising considering the part of London I live in. Far cry from other countries (*cough* America *cough*).

&gt;and that ""white Brits"" consider you to be just as British as them?

I often wonder this. I consider myself pretty British, to the extent that I'm fairly sure anyone talking to me without seeing me would probably assume I'm white, but I don't really know how other people who have seen me view me.

&gt;And how closely do you keep the links to your parents' cultures/homelands? + Where are your parents from?

Mostly for me it's the food. I know how to cook proper Indian food. I also have a few bits and pieces from India from all the times we've been there. But other than that, I have near enough zero Indian cultural traits (and all the Indians who call me a coconut would back me up on that one &gt;_&gt;).

Edit: A big thing I forgot was that growing up I learned a second mother tongue (Telugu) from my grandparents. I think it really helped me with learning languages in general and I can now speak a bit of French, semi-fluent in German, and am learning a bit of Italian for a trip this summer, in addition to English and Telugu.

Miliband &amp; Cameron are career politicians, they don't care about the state of our country or the mass unemployment/ wage suppression from unskilled workers we're suffering from currently.

&gt;The __Type 45 destroyer__, also known as the __D__ or ___Daring*-class__, is an advanced class of [guided missile destroyers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_missile_destroyer) built for the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom)'s [Royal Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy). The class is primarily designed for [anti-aircraft and anti-missile warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare) and is built around the [PAAMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAAMS) (Sea Viper) air-defence system utilizing the [SAMPSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAMPSON) [AESA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_electronically_scanned_array) and the [S1850M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S1850M) long-range radars. The first three destroyers were assembled by [BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems_Surface_Fleet_Solutions) from partially prefabricated ""blocks"" built at different shipyards, the remaining three were built by [BAE Systems Maritime – Naval Ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems_Maritime_%E2%80%93_Naval_Ships). The first ship in the *Daring* class, [HMS *Daring*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Daring_(D32\)), was launched on 1 February 2006 and commissioned on 23 July 2009.

5. Spurs, like Liverpool but slightly shitter.

6. Southampton, fantastic manager, great players but doubt they will be able to sustain themselves.

* first of all, the word secular refers to separation of government and religion. The UK has non-elected bishops as members of parliament and the queen as the head of the church of England. So in that sense the UK is much, much less secular than the US, or for instance France.

* it is true that Christianity probably plays a lot less of a central role in most people's life in the UK than the US. A lot of people still identify as Christian, or having Christian values though.

* in the UK, and in the rest of Europe, there is much more support for the idea of restricting personal liberties for the sake of the common good, reducing harm to others, etc. (think about the gun rights for instance)

* this is a bit of a generalisation, but the UK traditionally tends to have a more prudish nature than some other European countries and for a long time quite conservative views on for instance sex education.

A combination of the two last points means that the ""OMG, won't somebody think of the children"" line does still ring well with parts of the electorate.

With the ridiculous applications per year metric of this guy aside, this is how the job market is regardless of field. There are fewer opportunities available each year than there are graduates, and the pool of inexperienced graduates increases year on year. If you miss the boat the year following your graduation it becomes increasingly difficult to attract the attention of employers. The ideal way to do it is to have a job waiting for you when you leave university which is easier said than done but quite a lot of people don't really commit much time to it until they graduate. That is why you should do everything you can to increase your chances whilst you can.

Anybody reading this who is still at university in their third year, **APPLY NOW**. Anybody in their first or second year, **LOOK FOR A PLACEMENT NOW** (Either for the summer, or for a sandwich year). Most companies plan their graduate recruitment to coincide with the end of the academic year, so by the time you finish your exams most schemes are closed to new applicants.

London midland have a service that calls at Bletchley and Leighton Buzzard only, then express to Euston. This shouldn't take much longer than the Virgin services but you might be able to find a ticket for cheaper if you get a ""London Midland only"" ticket.

I think that Staines &amp; Co. have misidentified the estimated total number of people living with HIV from heterosexual infection with the number of heterosexuals with HIV who are of African origin.  So the figure should be 40,000-ish, or slightly less, rather than 60,000-ish.  You are right there.

There is no data on where those of African origin acquired HIV, nor on what their immigration status is.  

There is also no data on how or from whom the estimated 20,000 HIV+ heterosexuals not of African origin caught it. 

Some, of course, are injecting drug users. 

A paper such as 
www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/crer/events/african/confp_david_owen.ppt 

shows that there has been a rapid rise in African immigration since the late 1990s, so that a high proportion (I cannot estimate how high) were born abroad and came to the UK.

I agree with you that Staines &amp; Co. should show their working, however approximate, as that would be honest. 

Like you, I would like to know if £7000, £20000, or £25000 per annum is the average cost of care. Or, to put it differently, an estimated total cost per HIV+ person of £300,000 or £1,000,000? 

I'm somewhat interested in this argument because way, way back I was responsible for dealing with some applications for people from sub-Saharan Africa to come to this country.  I was surprised to discover that they were never asked about their HIV status,  and because of medical confidentiality, if they passed it on to anybody here, nobody might know until years later.  
    I felt that everybody involved would benefit if the people coming here were tested. The doctors I knew agreed, but the very idea of requiring an HIV test as a condition of entry was regarded as unspeakably politically incorrect.  Seeing this debate now, I am curious to know what the effect of this no-test policy has been.

- Brother 3: born in 1992, in Birmingham, England -- he'd consider himself British-Pakistani;

- Brother 4 (well, me!): born in 1994, in Birmingham England -- I'd consider myself Irish-first, then Northern Irish/British (they're the same in my eyes) but hardly Pakistani (I recognise it, and I've visited and stuff, but I'd not call myself Pakistani, I'm much more likely to say I'm Pashtun (the ethnic group that my Da is from which is spread across Pakistan/Afghanistan), but even then, I'd hardly call myself that);

NOTE: in 1995 my family moved to Belfast, Northern Ireland.

- Sister 1: born in 1996, in Belfast, Northern Ireland -- she'd consider herself British-Pakistani;

- Sister 2: born in 1997, in Belfast, Northern Ireland -- she'd consider herself British-Pakistani.

My Mum would also consider herself British-Pakistani, whilst my Da would consider himself Pakistani.

&gt;How British do you feel and how much pride do you take in being British? 

I recognise England as my home-country and have absolutely no problem with them/that at all.  But I wasn't raised there and feel far less affinity toward Birmingham than my elder brothers do.  They're more religious -- Islam -- and grew up in an Asian community for a decent portion of their lives so have that shared sense of 'pride' in their ancestry that was lost on me (growing up in a more Christian city in Belfast).

I also joke about tea and all that good nonsense over at /r/britishproblems... like we're getting Gregg's in Northern Ireland now, for fuck sakes.  Can't we keep shitty pseudo-bakeries *outside* of these lovely Irish shores?!

&gt;Do you feel that you've not faced discrimination and that ""white Brits"" consider you to be just as British as them? 

We faced extreme racism growing up in Belfast.  We were basically the only coloured people in our area (that isn't an exaggeration), and heck I'd used to count on the school-bus back in first year (2005/06) the amount of black people I saw on the 15 minute bus-ride home (sometimes I wouldn't see any).  In fact, the first time I saw a black person as a child I remember running back around the corner to my Mum and saying: ""LOOK MUM!  Quick, someone got burnt and their skin is all dark!""  She slapped be around the head when she rounded the corner and saw a Black woman.  One of my best friends has a similar story when he saw a black person in the library for the first time and said: ""Look Mum it's a monkey-man!""  His Mum went up to apologies and beat his cunt in when they got home.  Anyway, I digress.  

We faced extreme racism and prejudice, here are some (I tend to forget some, too, so sorry if I do that):

- some local shops would refuse to serve us or bar us for no good reason: ""We don't like Pakis around here""; ""Go to your own country""; etc. etc.;

- we got called racist names everyday for years-upon-years: ""Paki""; ""Purr Purr Ding Ding""; ""Indian Bastards""; ""Paki Bastards""; ""Go Back to your Own Country""; ""Nigger""; ""Shite-head/Shite-face"", and the one that used to make me most scared: ""There ain't no black in the Union Jack / So pull that trigger, and shoot that nigger"";

- when we first moved, I was too young to remember but apparently it was *really* bad -- bricks through the windows weekly, the most dangerous was a brick landed ""inches"" (according to my Mum) from where my youngest sister was sleeping in her cot;

- we moved house to somewhere 10 minutes down the road when I was about 8/9 (I was in P6) -- they stole our school uniform from the washing line, the people in the old people's home used to complain when we played football in the street (but when white people did it it was fine), there was crowds that would literally gather outside the street and wait for us to leave and then chase us;

- I remember playing football with some local kids (me and my 3 brothers were one team; these 4 lads were the other team), we won so they chased us and beat my eldest brother;

- I remember our windows getting done-in for years and years and years at its height 38 weeks (out of 52 weeks in a calender year) we had at least 1 window done-in in the house.  My sisters to this day don't leave their windows open at night because someone threw a bottle into their room once whilst it was open.

So, to answer your question, we were treated like second-class citizens and it led to me getting extreme social anxiety growing up.  I used to really enjoy going out and playing football (I even had a six-pack at one point!) but during my early teen years every time I made a friend they ended up being racist in some way.  This led to me abandoning friends and just sticking to being the class clown.  I never had a social life, I feared even walking the streets because I kept getting paranoid that people were staring/pointing/laughing at me for being a 'Paki'.

&gt;And how closely do you keep the links to your parents' cultures/homelands? + Where are your parents from?

Meh, it really dissipates the further down you go in our family.  The eldest three boneheads are very: 'women must wear scarves and stay indoors' type Muslim, and completely split the family apart when my Ma divorced my Da.  They said she wasn't welcome in their houses and all that shite, calling her a 'slag' and 'whore' and saying nasty shite like that.  Me?  I believe in The Absurd and would identify as an Absurdist.  My sisters follow a milder form of Islam in that they believe in a monotheistic God, but don't really follow the Qu'ran: they won't wear scarves, they'll wear what they want, they'll go out wherever so long as I know where they are, etc. etc.

Oh, and that's not because I'm a control-freak, my Da is disabled so I've been the 'Man of the House' since I was 15.  Generally all I tell them to do is give me a text letting me know where they are and when they'll be home.  If they're more than 15 minutes late then I'll call 'em to make sure nothing's wrong.

Ermm... aye, that should cover your question, I think; any more questions, just fire away!

Last thing to mention: the racism didn't stop naturally.  My Mum got tired of it after they did her windshield in and chased her with a metal pole so she met with some local paramilitary leaders and I remember the meeting well actually (mostly 'cause I was scared).  They came around to our house, Mum offered them tea, they declined, they sat in the living room (all the kids had our ears pressed to the door, of course) and eventually it went down to: ""My kids know who the racist people are, they can point them out for you"".  Mum opened the door, we all acted like we hadn't heard and basically we pointed out, gave names, and within a week all the racism had stopped.  In fact, those gangsters came back and said some people would even like to meet in-person and apologise.

If you wonder how they achieved this it was most likely masked men banging in doors at the middle of the night and intimidating parents with hammers/baseball bats/knives/guns and telling them to control their kids, or else going to the kids themselves and intimidating them.

This type of paramilitary justice is common enough in Belfast for joyriders or youths selling drugs, etc. and this fear drives down petty crime rates (I think Belfast's is as low as Japan's).

Anyway, it wasn't as if we didn't phone the police because we did for *years upon years* and all of their pussy-footing did sweet fuck-all for us.  We had to go the extreme route and it worked.  The P.S.N.I. were complete and utter fucking wank in this case.

Sorry for the rant, but there's some insight to life as a second-generation migrant.

Combined, the SNP and the Tories have the ability to push Labour down into the ranks of Lib Dems, and the Tories are not seemingly that bothered about Scotland being independent, whereas Labour require Union for their very survival (either directly or via SNP support).

I've seen that excuse so many times, and people only back it up with teams like Swansea, Newcastle, Hull, Spurs (lol) etc. These are, coincidentally, teams that weren't exactly lighting up Europa League when they were playing either. Most of these teams suffer from small squads, exception being Tottenham.

Let's look at the current teams still in the Europa League:

**Sevilla** - Currently sitting at 5th place, 3 points behind Valenica in 4th.
Last year the finished 5th, 7 points behind 4th.
Sevilla won the Europa League last year.

**Zenit St Petersburg** - Current leaders of the RPL, 8 points ahead of CSKA Moskva. Zenit entered the Europa League after finishing 3rd in their CL group, like us. Zenit finished second last year, 1 point behind Moskva.

**Club Brugge** - Current leaders of the Belgian Premier League, and the Championship Playoff. (It's like the MLS system or something)
They finished 3rd last season, 3 points off the title.

**Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk** - 3rd in the league, 8 points behind Dynamo Kyiv.
They finished 2nd last season, 6 points behind Shaktar Donetsk.

**Dynamo Kiev** - 1st in the league. Finished 4th last season.

**Fiorentina** - Currently sitting at 4th in the Serie A, 6 points behind 3rd. They finished 4th last season, 13 points behind Napoli in 3rd.

**Napoli** - The current biggest loser of the ""Europa effect"", sitting at 6th, 2 points behind Fiorentina at 4th. They finished 3rd last season, 24 points behind you know who at 1st.
Napoli actually qualified for the Champions League qualification, but they lost the final playoff match against Athletic Bilbao. Napoli haven't played all that great this year, but they won the Supercoppa, which is basically the Italian Charity Shield, and they're currently in the Semi-final of the Coppa Italia, alongside Fiorentina.

**Wolfsburg** - Sitting in 2nd place, 10 points behind Muller and the crazy gang. Wolfsburg finished 5th last season.
Many people consider Wolfsburg to be the current favourites to win the tournament, and I would have to agree. They are playing some great football.

Most of the teams that are still left in the Europa League, are also performing either as expected, or beyond expectation in their various league. The only team who's struggling, is Napoli. And we all know what Rafa is capable in europe. Who's not to say they go ahead and win the double.

My point here is that teams that have good squads and good rotations usually perform well both abroad as they do domestically.

Three routes need to happen in my honest opinion. There needs to be a Wirral 'loop' via West Kirby incorporating the Bidston to Shotton line. It may not go via Shotton and cut to Chester via Parkgate/Neston There would be a direct part of the loop from Chester and Ellesmere Port. This needs to be a double line with trains in each direction with more rolling stock than the current Merseyrail line uses. This will allow growth on the Wirral. The spur to new Brighton would either be in the loop or a dedicated train changing at Wallesey Grove Road or where ever it bifurcates.

There needs to be two loop lines in the city. There is already track/tunnels for 1/2 of these. I can update if there is interest. Suffice to say there were some very short sighted closures.

Finally a connection to JLA is just a matter of time, Liverpool South Parkway is a bit of a white elephant imho, Hunts Cross already connected the city and northern lines and the buses could just run on bus routes. Should of ploughed the cash into a spur to JLA direct.

 Let's be honest the property values that end of town wouldn't be too high for some compulsory purchase orders and a quick tunnel underneath the highway or god forbid an overpass. South Parkway was part of the tram idea iirc, which will never happen. Trams are cheaper but worse in every way to tunnels and trains in my opinion. Easier to keep a closed system running. 

So honestly her plan is good, but not what we can start tomorrow. What I detailed above is what we can start that would improve the city. But to start with the small things you have to have a massive overarching plan otherwise its a million times harder to add things to it later. Putting another stop on a underground line is a gigantic ballache instead or putting in the foundations and digging out the ground (and allowing for that ground removal) when digging the initial tunnel.

Yes....  Yes we would.

Which market?  Investment banking, that can be 'passported' in for a firm from Geneva (this has already happened to a few hedge funds).

Ok, wonder what those 12 steps are..

&gt;  1. We admitted we were powerless over sex and love addiction - that our lives had become unmanageable.
&gt;  2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.
&gt;  3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood God.
&gt;  4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.
&gt;  5. Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.
&gt;  6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.
&gt;  7. Humbly asked God to remove our shortcomings.
&gt;  8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.
&gt;  9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.
&gt;  10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.
&gt;  11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with a Power greater than ourselves, praying only for knowledge of God's will for us and the power to carry that out.
&gt;  12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to sex and love addicts and to practice these principles in all areas of our lives. 

That's a lot of God steps, so as an atheist you would not stand a chance of being cured of ""porn addiction""! Thankfully our politicians seems to be on a crusade to save us from ourselves! /s

It's the same series that the 24 hours of Le Mans is a part of, with [1000BHP hybrid monsters that look far better than F1 cars](http://f1weekends.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Le_Mans_2014_F1Weekends.jpg), sound far better (even before the 2014 ruleset), are more road relevant, has better drivers (i.e. half the field aren't inexperienced kids paying to be there), the series actually cares about the fans and the racing (£35 for a bog standard ticket to Silverstone on the Sunday, including grandstand seating at any grandstand you feel like visiting, access to the infield (another £100 for the F1 fans) and the pit walk (VIPs only for F1)), better racing (i.e. it's close in every class as the cars are not only built to good regs but balanced when needed), and more. It's on Motors TV for free and has a self-produced internet stream for a fiver for the whole year with a great commentary team. It really is worth checking out.

The Blancpain Endurance Series is possibly the best GT series going and has free streaming on their website, and their sister series the Blancpain Sprint Series is kicking off this weekend (race 1 tomorrow). British GT is at Outlen Park for their first round, sadly without coverage online, catchup highlights on TV only for now.

Firstly, there is no right, unless attained by agreement, so you can't deny them a right they don't have. Secondly, as I've said, although nationality appears to be te basis of the decision, it isn't. They are denied not because they are American or Armenian,, etc, but because their state has not negotiated the free movement. Without agreement to the contrary, creating a better deal for all parties and CREATING a right for each state's citizens, the EU countries  would have the same immigration policies we apply to the US, etc. they would have no right. We created a free movement right as part of a social contract/ a trade. Just because we  have formed a contract with the EU and haven't done so with the US does not mean we discriminate against the US. 

The point is very niche and pivots on a fine point. If it was discrimination, then we'd have foreign nationals suing us left, right and centre.

That's just a little behind Arsenal, who of course signed Ozil and Sanchez reasonably recently.
I don't believe that other players would ask for a pay rise if you brought in a very good player, they're not stupid and they know if a player is worth the money they are being paid. Look at Man U for example, bringing in a fair few very good players over the summer and it wasn't as if Rooney and Van Persie demanded bigger contracts when Falcao came in. 

Personally I think the main reason behind the unwillingness to buy big, is simply it is not the ethos of the manager or the owners to do so, instead preferring to play the low risk-high reward game. Liverpool, whatever anyone wants to think are still a massive club with global appeal, and although currently we aren't the best team in England, we're still a top 5/6 side in arguably the most watched/most difficult league in the world, and Liverpool's finances obviously reflect that. 

They could 100% throw tons of money at one very good mercenary and get him, but they won't do that because it isn't consistent with the clubs transfer policy.

Why is that the targets of this movement are almost exclusively men, right down to the name of the movement, which refers to male masturbation? If masturbation is addictive, why would women be magically immune to the supposedly devastating addiction?

Pornography has existed for as long as visual art has. Why is there no record before now of this supposed epidemic of addiction? It's been 15,000 years.

If masturbation is addictive, why does the professional association of psychiatrists not recognise or treat it? Is this some sort of global conspiracy?

What is the mechanism of this claimed addiction? We know that behaviours can be addictive but not pictures on a monitor. How exactly does the victim become ""addicted"" to something with no physical effect and why is this ""epidemic"" only caused by porn and not other media?

The list could go on and on of course. But the truth is that there is no scientific basis for your claims, least of all from the NHS who, in case you've forgotten, also prescribe homeopathy. SO by your ""reasoning"" you must believe homeopathy is valid because the NHS provide it, right?

Nothing *wrong* with it. I don't agree with it personally. Immigrants contribute more to the economy than they take out, and I think more immigration is helpful to our country, and temporarily offsets the problem of our aging population (although only temporarily).

I think leaving the EU would be incredibly damaging for UK business - and I worry that it would also be very dangerous for our civil liberties and working rights to withdraw from the human rights legislation.

&gt;I'm sure Conservative are a party that's anti-EU, Cameron promised a referendum on leaving and he did not deliver.

There is *no way* Cameron is anti-EU. I think a lot of Tory backbenchers might be in favour of leaving, but the leadership of the Tory party are definitely pro-EU. They hide it, because a lot of their voters don't agree - but they know it would be bad for the businesses that they and their friends own.

&gt;However in the grand scheme of things for England, Farage (IMO) should get one term in office to instate some level of control

I think he would do irreparable damage very quickly. One term would be far too much. Luckily there's no chance of this happening.

null,false,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,null,"&gt; There is no obvious advantage to the Tory vote in pushing the SNP towards an open declaration of support of Labour.

If you assume that the Conservatives don't win this election, what's their second-best outcome? It's that the SNP becomes the default choice of voters in Scotland. If that happens then it permanently negates about 30-40 of Labour's seats, which Labour have held consistently for decades.

From the Conservative's POV those seats were never coming back to them in the short term - but taking them away from Labour reduces the margin that the Conservatives need to pull ahead in the rest of the UK.

From the SNP's POV, that's just fine - they want to replicate the ""well, why wouldn't I vote X"" hold over Scotland that Labour had since the 1960s.

From Labour's POV, this looked like a gift horse. The Conservatives are so toxic in Scotland that the idea that the SNP might be in cahoots with them must have seemed like a life-line - hence Miliband coming out with ""damning revelations"" and Scottish Labour [doing likewise](https://twitter.com/scottishlabour/status/584108094919221250). Unfortunately it [turned out to be a trojan horse](https://storify.com/theSNP/telegraph-and-the-scottish-labour).

The origin appears to be the [Lib Dem-controlled Scotland Office](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/scottish-politics/french-diplomat-i-told-friend-in-scotland-office-about-sturgeon-meeting.122423565). Their Scottish leader is normally pretty invisible in UK politics (hands up who in this sub could pick Willie Rennie out of a line-up?) yet, curiously, a response from both him and Jim Murphy were included in the original Telegraph story.

My guess as to what happened is that this was a Lib Dem originated story (as they're also under severe post-referendum pressure from the SNP in Scotland, just as Scottish Labour are), leaked to a Conservative-supporting paper (who'll run with it because it benefits the Conservatives), which Labour then jumped on (because it seemed like all their Christmases had come at once).

Unfortunately for Labour it turned out to be not true, and unfortunately for the Lib Dems there's only about half a dozen people in the Scotland Office who could be responsible.

My guess is the Telegraph thinking was that if it's true it screws the SNP, and if it's not true it makes Labour look like idiots given that they'll go up to eleven on it. Journalistic integrity is something they [gave up on some time ago](http://news.stv.tv/scotland-decides/analysis/303773-stephen-daisley-reviews-the-alan-cochrane-referendum-diaries/):

The supporters of UKIP - and the Radical Right in general - tend to fall into a specific demographic known as *""The Left Behinds""*.

The Left Behinds tend to be:

 - +55 years of age.
 - Male.
 - White.
 - *Not possess an education above secondary level*.
 - Be employed either currently or formerly in a rountine professional or non-manual role.
 - They tend to come from areas that have *not* been exposed to a high level of immigration.
 - They have not beneffited from globalisation.
 - They have not benefitted from multiculturalism.
 - They tend to be economically left wing (by which it is meant that they support the NHS and the idea of a welfare state *in general*. This varies with Radical Right parties as some like UKIP *broadly* support the welfare state to some degree whereas others like the French National Front and the Vlaams Belang have differing viewpoints).
 - The Left Behinds tend to be politically and socially conservative, with little support for progressive notions such as equal marriage etc.
 - With regards to political science, the Left Behinds and their parties tend to have RILE (Right-Left Amalgamated score composed of MARPOR Manifesto Analysis and other data) scores of +8.5 to +9.5. Vlaams Belang and the FN have a score of around 9.5, along with the BNP and the Sweden Democrats (There tends to be crossover between Radical and Far right), and UKIP sits at 8.5. Note that RILE goes from -10 to +10 with -10 being extremely far left and +10 being extremely far right.

Not really true. UK taxes are only low for corporations and the self-employed.

So even if you pay ""lower rate"" income tax at 20%, you also pay 13% of additional income tax in the form of NI, and your employer pays another 13% of additional income tax in the form of employer's NI.

Lipglosses: I *hate* lipgloss, for the most part. I was only tempted by these because they were mad cheap. However... I actually like them a lot! They're about as tacky as a thicker lip balm, they're not gooey or slippery. 

I was surprised by Joy (light pink with gold shimmer), I can usually not pull off anything in the light pink category on the lips. This, on the other hand, it really nice. Applied sheer, it gives just a touch of pink and a bit of shimmer. Light vanilla scent.

Flirt is a light pinky-peach. As I was first applying it I thought it was gonna look gross, but when I blended it out it looked so much better - I think that because I applied it lightly, it allowed the natural colour of my lips to show though so it suited better. Again, light vanilla scent.

I like Vixen the most of the lipglosses. It's a bit thinner so it feels more comfortable and I like the bright pinky-red colour. It has a sweet cherry smell, which is quite strong - it's quite an artificial smell though, it may not agree with those who are sensitive to scents.

Lipsticks:

Pink lemonade: this reminds me of how Revlon Lip Butter in Macaron looks on me. Dark pink with gold shimmer. It's pretty opaque! I'm used to liquid lipsticks being matte so it's quite weird seeing a non-matte one. Really nice colour, if a bit heavy for summer. Has a spearminty smell.

Strawberry: well... there's always a dud in every order, eh? This is the most generic red lip gloss I have ever seen. Super-sheer (I don't think you could get it to be pigmented unless you piled in on 1cm thick). The worst part is *the smell*. It smells like Vaseline, sorta - that really chemically, plastic smell. 

Blushes: I haven't tried these yet, apart from swatching. They are really creamy and soft and a little goes a long way (in the swatches I seriously used a tiny blob about about 1mmx1mm). I bought four shades - I have the fifth shade (dark berry shade, Showstopper) already and if these are anything like it, they will have mad staying power and be *very* easy to use too much of... a light hand is  a must!",null,0,null,1428270481,null,0,false,0,cq2aygu,null,t3_31k4sw,null,t1_cq2aygu,null,t3_31k4sw,null,null,null,1432214760,null,1,false,MakeUpAddictionUK,t5_319vn,1,null

When I work with communication it might be things like helping people and their families create life books that include a lot of things that were important to that person - this allows shared reminiscence and also helps care staff see the person as a person rather than just seeing the dementia.  We also work with families on shaping environments to help communication - things like rearranging furniture to help the person find their way, choosing high-contrast furniture that can be seen easily, reducing background noise and distraction, setting things up to deal with hearing impairment.  We also sometimes work directly on the communication styles of the carers/family to reduce distress and make everyday life easier.

Who Needs to Quaran when you have pretty much hundreds of Hadith that could justify it as well. 

&gt;it seems that even genuinely positive topics of Islam bring out all the haters and bigots, who are falling over themselves to throw bile.

I'd like you to point out a single topic that was anti Islamic that came even close to 1000+ upvotes. I can't find one. Anti-Islamic posts on here barley break the 100+ mark because people take no interest in them. There arte people who pretty critical of islam, can you blame them?

&gt;There was a time when I genuinely wanted to go fight with the Kurds myself. I still do. I've always been vocal in my opposition to radicalism, to hate preachers, to oppression, to divisions, to all of those things that the likes of IS represent.

Are we supposed to be impressed that you don't want you don't want to go out and kill people? Is anyone supposed to be impressed that other Human beings don't want to leave and kill others. that's not impressive, it's called being a civilized person, also who said anything about attacking Kurds? Serious question, what have kurds done that have angered you?

&gt;But what the hell is the point when the odds are so loaded agai at me and people are so fuelled by bile, they seek to drag even my most positive actions through the mud?

I used to actually defend the Muslims communities myself too, I used to go on about how ISIS ""aren't Muslims"" and that it's just isolated incidents., But when this crap gets pushed into your face 24/7 you lose hope pretty quickly, I feel I managed to to hold together quite well considering I frequently go on the Syrian Civil war sub and just look at all the horrible news that passes by about Muslims killing each other, the literal hundreds of Jihadi groups attacking minorities in the Middle East, pretty disheartening. 

If you think Muslims are treated like crap now imagine how it was during the early 2000's, god forbid being black in America during the 50's. Yet, there are 7 Muslims countries were I would be killed just for my beliefs. So, understand my skepticism towards a belief that seems to want to kill me in it's majority believer countries.

He'd told me how to ask for a tissue, but it was a pretty long sentence and I knew nearly nothing of English.

I don't think you can place the blame on Everton's current league form solely on their participation in the Europa League, and besides, they're exactly like the other teams I mentioned. Everton's squad isn't deep enough to compete in 4 tournaments in one season. 

&gt; All of those teams are also in much easier leagues, the prem is far more demanding vs every single game as we've seen multiple times this season and last season.

What are you basing this statement on? There's no way to make a statement like that. It's just a general bs statement that r/soccer tends to wave around, without any way to back it up. Sure, the RPL and the Ukranian league are below the EPL by quite a margin, but La Liga and Bundesliga? No way.

4. **Valencia** - Reached the round of 16 in the CL 12/13. CL Finalist twice. (2000 and 2001)

5. **Sevilla** - Europa League winners 13/14. Reached the round of 16 in the CL 09-2010. Same year, Liverpool placed 3rd in their group with 7 points, 6 points behind Lyon and 8 behind Fiorentina. This was our last particpation in the CL until now.

6. **Villareal CF** - CL-Semi-finals in 05/06 and CL-quarter-finals in 08/09. 09/10 the reached the round of 32 in the Europa League. In the 10/11 Europa League, they reached the semi-finals, losing to eventual winners Porto.

7. **Malaga** - Reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League in 12/13, losing to eventual finalists Borussia Dortmund.


Let's compare this to the current top 7 of the Premier League. I'm only including PL history, as we all know, football started in the 90s.

1. **Chelsea** - Won the CL in 2012. They've been Englands best team in Europe for the last 5 years. Not gonna bother listing their results, as most of us are probably already aware.

2. **Arsenal** - For the last 5 season in a row, Arsenal has been eliminated in the round of 16 of the CL.

3.  **Manchester United** - Won the CL 07/08. Lost both finals against Barcelona in 08/09 and 10/11. Reached the quarter finals last season. 

4. **Manchester City** - Never gone further than the round of 16, a feat they've accomplished two season in a row. In 12/13, they ended 4th in their group with 3 points, behind Ajax with 4.

5. **Us!** - Won it in 2005. Losing finalist in 06/07. Semi-finals in 07/08. Quarter-finals in 08/09. Europa League semi-finals in 09/10. After this we've either not qualified for Europe or gone out in the round of 16/32.

6. **Tottenham** - CL quarter-finals in 10/11. Europa league QF in 12/13.

7. **Southampton** - AFAIK they have never been in Europe in the PL era.

&gt; But Rodgers had an opportunity to rotate the squad around for Europa and CL this season and he didn't do it and the performances around our Europa and CL games were poor as a result of that.. 

We were shit in the league as well, when we were playing in the CL. I think we were almost 10th at one point in december (haven't checked). When we reached the Europa League, our focus was solely on the league and the FA cup, meaning we let some of our best players rest for the away match at Besiktas (Coutinho and Henderson comes to mind). I'm positive we would have beat Besiktas if we were actually interested in playing the EL.

&gt; International break matters less for us too I think, quite a few of our players don't play/start for their national team AFAIK.

That's my point. Most of our players were rested and ready, but we still got slaughtered.",null,0,null,1428272475,null,0,1428335241,0,cq2c0ex,null,t3_31jpwg,null,t1_cq2c0ex,null,t1_cq2akhb,null,null,null,1432215326,null,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8,null

Whilst in the Prem even the teams in the bottom 6 almost regularly win against teams in the top 6 and we've struggled vs quite a few of them both this season and last season.

A large part of the reason we were shit in the league was Rodgers wasn't rotating properly. I remember Lambert started 6 games in 16 days without being subbed off once in late November. He's 33 years old ffs and fatigue was showing in the last couple of games. I remember he did the same with Gerrard at one point and probably a few other players too. Coutinho is currently on a crazy streak too.

We lost to West Ham, United and Chelsea then drew to Hull in the games directly after CL games this season. The last 2 are meh but the first 2 shouldn't be happening and I really don't think it's a coincidence.

Cool stat actually, there have been 4 international breaks this season and we've lost our first game after 3 of them. And the 4th was the QPR game which we barely scraped 3 points out of. I think this just shows that we're really poor unless the team can properly prepare for each game, which will be difficult in Europa.

Had this come out in the guardian I think the response would have been significantly different. 

The way I see it, the Telegraph have acquired (as journalists often do) a document which is of significant political relevance and is clearly in the public interest. That document they believed to be genuine - which as we have learned today seems to be true. (Obviously that doesn't necessarily mean its contents are true, only that the publication is legitimate). 

Should the Telegraph have asked Nicola Sturgeon or the Consul if it were true first?... my response would be *""Why?""*. If Sturgeon had said *""No, it's not true""* would that have stopped them publishing it? I would hope not, because she was obviously going to say no either way; either it's true and she's hardly going to fess up to something that would literally stone-wall her entire campaign OR it's not true and she won't admit to something that didn't happen. So what does the Telegraph then do? They are left in the position of having a genuine government document that is clearly in the public interest, but an individual who claims it's contents are false. Hardly the first time a politician has done that! I see no reason why they shouldn't have released the letter - it is clearly in the public interest irrespective of how it came to be in their hands, no different to the Snowdon files or the Wikileaks US Cables. 

Honestly, I think some of the flak being directed at the telegraph on this is unfair. There remain a number of big questions; 

* Who wrote this document and how did they come to believe that she said that?

* How did that document come to be in the hands of the Telegraph?

My mind is open about it... I'm slightly leaning towards what one commentator wrote; ""One of three things happened; either Nicola said it, someone thought Nicola said it, or someone made it up... the third is the least likely"". Regardless of the pious holier-than-thou image the SNP and Sturgeon in particular like to play, they are politicians like anyone else and we've seen before how adept they are at playing people off against each other. I wouldn't be remotely surprised it if were true and there is clearly a contorted logic to it. Having said that, it's election time and people do like to stick the knives in sometimes so I wouldn't be surprised if it weren't true either. At any rate, I'd be very interested to find out more and I'm glad the telegraph decided to run it.

null,false,MrFuckingRandom,null,null,null,"The duty of confidentiality can be broken in the public interest. It's a very grey area. 

Confidentiality exists because you provided information in a confidential manner (simplified test from 'Coco v AN Clark'). This is a professional and legal obligation. However, if can be broken.

They can break confidentiality to prevent further risk to the public and this is precisely what happened in 'W v Egdell', where a psychiatrist forwarded an unfavourable report to the pursuer's case managers (he was  a murderer applying to move to a less secure psych hospital) which contained confidential information about his gun obsession. If was in the public interest that this information be disclosed, then the confidentiality would give way. 

Similarly, the court has found that a doctors professional duty to maintain confidentiality will give way to a statutory request or compulsion to provide information (the relevant case concerned a doctor who refused to comply with a Road Traffic Act request to provide information). So if there is a statutory obligation to disclose certain information (and this is very topical at the moment with te child abuse scandals) then this will override confidentiality. 

The doctors are in a difficult position where the risk that the behaviour WILL continue outweighs the reliance on the patient saying it will. Sometimes, we then counter the duty of confidentiality with a duty to warn. Although we do not have the same kind of duty as California (The 'Tarasoff' doctrine), we have been persuaded by it's logic and that of 'C v Cairns' (an Australian case, I believe. May be British), where a child was sexually abused by the father but the mother insisted to the doctor that it was a one-off. The court said he probably shouldn't have relied on the mothers insistence and should have warned the police, but they had to consider the matter in light of the time period and as the conduct was in the 80's and awareness was poor, the doctor was protected. So in that respect, the doctor must act as a reasonable doctor would (Bolam v Friel)  in deciding whether the patients insistence that the conduct will not continue eliminates a current risk of re-offending. In deciding that, he'd probably look at the time elapsed since the last offence and the consultation or admission.

Obviously, certain crimes carry greater risk to the public (murder, terrorism, rape, etc) and so some crimes will influence them to break confidentiality, and some cannot justify it (perhaps kleptomania)  but in my opinion it is better for all parties that a doctor is given full disclosure, otherwise treatment is doomed to failure from the beginning.  Using hypotheticals won't really work as the doctor would take that as an admission. Why ask if it's not relevant, after all.

Take this with a pinch of salt. I am just a law student, but I do have an exam on medical confidentiality/duty to warn as part of medical law, in a month so I know the area roughly. Plus, I'm on mobile without any notes, so I'm not as thorough as I'd like to be.

In Antonissen [1991] it was stated that a work-seeker cannot be deported if they can provide evidence of continuing to seek employment and have genuine chances of becoming employed. Although it was stated that EU law cannot indefinitely protect such persons. The judgement found that the six month rule under UK law was not an unreasonable limit that would prevent foreign workers to get employment nor would it seriously interfere with the effectiveness of the principles of free movement.

In other cases, working intermittently over a period of 5 years did constitute work in Lair [1988] although the time of 5 years is not a requirement. In Leclere and Deaconescu [2001] it was stated that workers who lose their job still maintain the same legal status as a 'worker' allowing them to remain in the country, once under the protection of TFEU Art 45 it helps to protect against deportation. Furthermore, the threshold of work has been left deliberately wide meaning most forms of work will qualify, such as in the Trojani [2004] where a man who did domestic work around a hostel in exchange for lodge and a small amount of weekly pocket money was considered to be a worker and could not be deported.

null,false,Fjoggs,null,null,null," &gt;The disparity between the top few teams and the rest of the league in La Liga is HUGE. 

That's because La Ligas top teams are miles beyond EPLs top teams.

&gt; Whilst in the Prem even the teams in the bottom 6 almost regularly win against teams in the top 6 and we've struggled vs quite a few of them both this season and last season.

This follows my other point. Because the top teams are just so much better, the lower teams naturally struggle more. Confusing this with overall league depth is foolish. I don't see how you would know if Leicester City would beat Cordoba. Or if UD Almeira, the team Suso was loaned to last season, would lose to Burnley.

&gt; A large part of the reason we were shit in the league was Rodgers wasn't rotating properly.

I'd say the biggest reason for our bad form was that we had no idea how we wanted to play with our current team. Can and Sakho weren't even regulars until after December and Markovic wasn't looking anywhere near a good signing. We were so shaky at the back, it looked like teams would score on us any second. 

&gt;We lost to West Ham, United and Chelsea then drew to Hull in the games directly after CL games this season. The last 2 are meh but the first 2 shouldn't be happening and I really don't think it's a coincidence.

We lost to West Ham because we were outplayed. Tactically as well as performances on the pitch. I remember Downing having Gerrard in his pocket, because Rodgers played him too deep. That's not because of his match fitness, it's because Gerrard's fitness in general is not good enough to hold the DM role alone.

Funny you mention the United game, because that's looked upon as the turning point in our season. It's the game were we finally figured out our system, and we played way better than the scoreline suggests. We had Jones in goal, and they had De Gea who were playing out of his mind that game. I said this to a United friend, and I'll say it here too: I'm positive we would have won that game if we swapped goalkeepers.

&gt; I don't think the international break argument proves your point really, Arsenal are just a far better team than us at the moment with a much better squad sadly.

My point was simply that people often look for excuses when we lose. Had we played a Europa game on Thursday, you know someone would say that it affected the outcome of the match. Sometimes, the other team is simply better than you.",null,0,null,1428275048,null,0,false,0,cq2ddfn,null,t3_31jpwg,null,t1_cq2ddfn,null,t1_cq2csqp,null,null,null,1432215968,null,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

null,false,TKOohLa,null,null,null,"&gt;If masturbation is addictive, why would only doing it with porn be addictive? There should be large numbers of people who are addicted to masturbation without porn too.

I would assume there are given that the 3nd and 3rd link mentioned masturbation as a cause, not just masturbation using porn.

&gt;Why is that the targets of this movement are almost exclusively men, right down to the name of the movement, which refers to male masturbation?

Not a clue, could be a physical thing caused by testosterone levels or it might just be that males masturbate more often and so are more likely to get addicted. It's not exclusively a male thing on /r/nofap though, and well, women tend to be underrepresented on reddit anyway.

&gt;why would women be magically immune to the supposedly devastating addiction?

Who said it was devastating? Just because something wont kill you it doesn't mean you shouldn't get treatment.

&gt;Pornography has existed for as long as visual art has. Why is there no record before now of this supposed epidemic of addiction? It's been 15,000 years.

I don't think they had a great understanding of mental health issues 15000 years ago.

&gt;If masturbation is addictive, why does the professional association of psychiatrists not recognise or treat it? Is this some sort of global conspiracy?

Not sure who they are to be honest with you, but after a quick google [here's](http://www.ccpa-accp.ca/blog/?p=2762) a Canadian group and [here's](https://www.australiacounselling.com.au/mental-health-articles/addictions/symptoms-treatment-pornography-addiction/) an Australian group, and of course the NHS. No idea if they're reputable or not but clearly this global conspiracy to cover up porn addiction isn't very effective.

&gt;What is the mechanism of this claimed addiction? We know that behaviours can be addictive but not pictures on a monitor. How exactly does the victim become ""addicted"" to something with no physical effect and why is this ""epidemic"" only caused by porn and not other media?

The act of watching porn is itself a behaviour, and of course the masturbation that goes along with the porn watching. Other media certainly can cause addiction, video game addiction has caused deaths.

&gt;The list could go on and on of course. 

Please don't.

&gt;But the truth is that there is no scientific basis for your claims

Or yours. I wasn't trying to make a scientific argument, I simply pointed out that the NHS considered porn addiction to be a thing, not just weird cults. Unless you consider the NHS to be a weird cult that's indisputable, do you?

&gt;least of all from the NHS who, in case you've forgotten, also prescribe homeopathy. SO by your ""reasoning"" you must believe homeopathy is valid because the NHS provide it, right?

Well homeopathy works, the placebo effect is undeniable. I don't know when they prescribe it but I would hope it was only in cases where treatment with actual medicine wasn't needed. Can't say I have a problem with that really, not like water is very expensive. I can't immagine if you go to A&amp;E with a broken leg they'll just give you a glass of water and send you on your way.

Also the reason homeopathy is available on the NHS is purely political, NICE certainly doesn't recommend it, as soon as Charles kicks it we can say byebye to magic water.

Personally I think most of the people at r/nofap are just looking for something to blame for their shit social skills. Doesn't mean porn addiction isn't real though.

Edit: Just looked up the NHS page on Homeopathy because why not.

That isn't how quantitative easing works. The whole reason QE is used by the BoE is because asset purchases can be reversed quite easily (i.e. the assets can be sold again). Borrowing for investment spending (which I agree we should have done *far* more of, but for different reasons and in different ways) doesn't work that way.

&gt; I know what I would have done in 2007/9, let the banks go to the wall take over bank deposits.

An utterly terrible idea that would have completely porked the economy twice over. Lehman Brothers failing was bad enough, and they were just an investment bank; if an RBS or a Lloyds had gone down, even if deposits were safe it would still completely fuck the banking system over and wreck consumer confidence, not to mention market confidence. Bear in mind that banks do more than hold money - they lend money too. The grind to a halt of new lending was bad enough; the cessation of existing credit facilities to businesses and consumers, coupled with the inevitable disruption, would have been such an enormous shock we would have completely fucked the economy six ways from Sunday.

When anyone ever says we should have let the banks go to the wall, they need a good hard slap. Brown's move was pragmatic and reasonable, if not something everyone can fully agree with.

All this said, there is an excellent argument that whether or not the Tories ruined the economy, they certainly destroyed whatever recovery was showing in 2010 and took exactly the incorrect course of action.

This is just more of the same from them: $past examples'. It's not 'Oh, it's from the Telegraph, it won't be true then'. Had the Guardian done the same thing, then the 'cybernats' (as you so endearingly term them) would have criticised it for the same reason. The evidence is flimsy. 

&gt;Should the Telegraph have asked Nicola Sturgeon or the Consul if it were true first?... my response would be ""Why?"". 

Yes, they should have asked her. Journalistic integrity calls for offering people the right of reply. If she denied it, they need only print that she had denied it. Asking her opponents for comment, giving them time to prepare their media campaign, and then printing the story with the person unaware is throwing a political punch. Journalists should report the news, not engage in politicking against someone. 

&gt;My mind is open about it... I'm slightly leaning towards ... playing people off against each other. 

Absolutely they're politicians just like everyone else. They probably do plot and scheme just like those in Westminster. That said, people are very firmly coming down on one side or the other when there isn't enough evidence to say at the moment. Personally, the fact that the diplomatic service of another country has issued statements that contradict the memo would lead me to believe that she didn't say it. Just like you though, I can see the twisted logic that would lead to the conclusion that Cameron winning would be beneficial for the SNP so I'm not firmly set against ever believing it. The verdict at the moment is 'not proven', and not in the sense of 'not guilty but don't do it again' either.

  As to the Kurds, read my post again- I was specifically talking about joining the Kurds to **fight against IS**, not killing Kurds themselves. FFS English isn't my first language and I thought I was as clear as crystal.

Hell, I had one woman, threaten me infront of probably at least 30 witnesses that she would set me on fire and enjoy watching me burn because I was 'terrorist scum' (her exact words).

He has proven jack shit in his managerial career and all of his dumbass comments really make him seem like a bit of clown.

We need a manager with a proven track record domestically and in Europe if we really want to attract the right talent.

And you said fight with them, not alongside them so it can be taken in a few ways. 

And people have to be taken responsible because it's an ideology, a system that people subscribe too and follow, if there is flaws in that ideology then it's up the people who subscribe to it to face the issue and resolve it, same with Christianity, same with Buddhism, same with Conservatives, same with capitalists, same with Communists. It's s system people use as their face and political views and any hostile views it may hold have to be changed. How else do we judge others actions? 

Yeah, tensions tend to run high in communities where Muslims Have beheaded a solider in the street, flown planes into towers killing , shot up a a company that made magazines and opened fire on a fucking free-speech discussion. There's  the countless rape gangs in my country, the Councillors who've family friends have run off to join ISIS, the quite obvious ethnic splits that have been made in order to gain political leverage. I can post sources for all of those if you want. Then there is the horrific way they treat gays, women and kuffars. 

And also, how the fuck can you critisise the west for not being tolerant enough. What else do you want us to do?!! Do you want us all to just give up and convert to Islam, If you can point out a single Muslim majority country that is even slightly more tolerant than the U.S or U.K I will applaud you.

Maybe not. Mourinho always have a shot at winning a potential final against either. That's one of his strengths. Doesn't matter who it is, he can win. But, I personally think both are better than Chelsea by quite a margin honestly.  The way they completely shit the bed against a PSG team that was 1 man down for 1 hour and 30 minutes. They were even leading twice, and couldn't hold on.

Regarding the TV-money. Yes it's true, and it's a disgrace honestly. And you're right, these teams would struggle to get promoted from the Championship, but that goes for any team in the championship.

Just look at Fulham or Wigan. Wigan are looking to get demoted into League one, only 2 years after they were relegated from the Premier League. Blackpool, Wolverhampton, even Southampton have all been down there after being relegated from the PL.

&gt; There's no way to see if Leicester could beat Cordoba that's right, the clubs in the Prem are far richer though and therefore -should- have better squads.

They should, but they aren't. Following this logic, we should completely destroy Ludogorets or even Basel. But we didn't. 

&gt; Us being bad after CL games just shows Rodgers needs a decent amount of time to prepare for each game. Our record after international breaks also indicates that.

I don't really agree with the point of him struggling in these games because of lack of preparation, but even then, wouldn't the Europa League be a perfect stepping stone for him? How can we expect to do anything in the CL if Rodgers needs at least a week to prepare?

Rodgers needs all the experience he can get. His record in Europe is honestly abysmal. 
Rafa won the CL in 2005 with a team that had no business even being in the final. We had a few stars like Alonso and Gerrard, but most of them were on the level of players we have now.

&gt;  Maybe if we're in Europa League he can fix that within the first few months but what if he doesn't? what if we finish 5th/6th again?

I don't think Europa is the barricade that's preventing us from top 4. I think it's the lack of signing experienced players that can come in and perform now, instead of later. Our youth academy is filled up. We need players like James Milner who can come in and perform now. Someone with experience in Europe, as well as a good league.

It's getting late here in Europe (02:18 AM), so I might not be able to answer until I wake up. It's an interesting discussion. :)",null,0,null,1428279373,null,0,false,0,cq2fqc1,null,t3_31jpwg,null,t1_cq2fqc1,null,t1_cq2eo35,null,null,null,1432217080,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

This porn issue isn't going away and is stated time and time again that it's merely a front for censorship. What this will likely do is lead kids with curiosity(and hopefully more adults) into understanding the internet and the technology surrounding it.

Issues such as net-neutrality and censorship are important. I think the internet has allowed information to be free and that scares people in power. Kids will find a way around censorship as they always have and gain knowledge from doing so(it will be spread at school for example), what the government may unwittingly do is create a more technology savvy generation which is a good thing.

We know they just want to set a precedent for further reach of power and while the government continually switch the ways which they do this, we keep protesting the same ways and winning some of the smaller battles given us a false sense of power.

Imagine them passing this law leads more people to using Tor, this will likely(from what we know) present them with a problem because I imagine a lot of them need it for military among other things. The porn industry tends to be pretty good innovators when it comes to using technology, maybe they'll start putting up a lot of Tor exit and relay nodes. Maybe the paid for sites will switch to bitcoin which opens the door to the cryptocurrency for a lot of people? I think we need to rethink how we approach some of our traditional protests because you're very much correct(but you got to admit it was funny watching that outside parliament).

People are not yet squeezed enough that they will consider any sort of revolution and porn, likely, isn't going anywhere or be the issue that sets them off(but it may get them thinking). Snowden said encryption works, so lets use it. Surveillance in the UK is probably the worst in the world and the 'internet wars' won't be won on the street they will be won using the technology because no government can afford to lose their monopoly on media. Once people start taking notice change will eventually come, let's not take too long about it though...

People probably should be taking to the streets. There's also an election coming up and although I'm pretty disillusioned with politics for the first time I've registered to vote even though I'm not sure it will change anything. All I've seen since I can remember is lies by politicians but I hope there are a few good eggs among the pig shit but from what I understand they are few and far between.

null,false,therealmyself,null,null,null,"The is pressure for it to be reduced, but he changes needed to reduce immigration are beyond the reach for the above parties. The rhetoric can be tough on immigration, but the actual policies needed will never happen.

Nobody, not even UKIP would stop tier 2 and 3 highly skilled migrants from coming. It would make no sense and be economic suicide. I very much doubt there would me much appetite to reduce student immigration considering the amount of tuition fees they pay and the economic benefits.

 A large proportion of immigrants are European or can migrate to the UK based on European law, (family, or partners of europeans). A large number are asylum seekers or are coming to the UK as family as part of a family reunion visa. People will also be able to stay in the UK based on the European convention on human rights article 2 and 3, and right to family and private life. 

Unless we leave Europe there isn't the tools for the major parties to actually reduce immigration in significant numbers. Out of the top few parties with the conservatives there is much of a chance of leaving Europe and personally I don't see it happening. 

I see UKIP as the only party that can credibly reduce immigration by significant numbers, as they are pro leaving Europe. 

As I said I am a bit cynical. I worked for years at the Home Office dealing with section 4 support for failed asylum seekers. I only saw the people who didn't deserve asylum and may were granted indefinite leave to remain based on time spent in the UK and having kids. I didn't really deal with the peple who genuinely deserved asylum, and I think I need to check my biases sometimes. 

I genuinely believe UKIP is the only party that willl actually reduce immigration in significant numbers, but I can't vote for them as it will end up with a government that is more right wing than the tories.

I do actually agree. It wasn't really my point - I was making the case that irrespective of how seemingly apparent it is, the Telegraph was right to print the story. It's now up to us, and to the inquiry to decide on the truth... but just burying it because it seems unlikely wouldn't be ""journalistic"". Should they have given her a heads up about it? I'm less convinced they should. In a sense that is where their political alignment and affiliations can play into it. Arguably it actually hurts the conservatives since their best chances of an election victory hinge on labour performing poorly in Scotland. The Telegraph do certainly have an axe to grind with Scottish nationalists which is unsurprising given the paper is vociferously a pro-monarchy unionist publication. It's no different to some of the incredibly slanderous material that a paper like Wings Over Scotland produce. But it's fine... papers are allowed to do that and it's an important part of democracy in that private individuals can write negative things about the state.  

Imagine another related scenario - a member of the public gives the telegraph an official government memo that seems to implicate a politician in a major sex offense. The paper diligently contacts that person for a response, and they (*of course*) deny it. What does that paper now do? The memo does seem subjective but it is a legitimate government document and it's clearly in the public interest to know if a) their elected politician has committed a crime and b) the government are apparently aware of it. 

I don't know, I think the downvotes my comment received speak for themselves - users aren't interested in a discussion where we sensibly put points across; they're more interested in pushing the SNP narrative. 

The stupid thing is I don't actually disagree that it seems unlikely. I suspect it's more likely there has been some miscommunication. It seems bold to say the least that Sturgeon would make such an important strategic comment to a foreign ambassador knowing full well that they would be reporting every word of it back to their own officials and those of the UK... Having said that, a government official has clearly documented in black and white that was what they believe took place. That alone is worthy of publication if only to drive an inquiry into it.

The telegraph came to be in possession of an official government document that made the claim. Irrespective of its accuracy the fact an official thought that was true in itself is in the public interest. 

The Telegraph is clearly a pro-union publication. They are entitled to release articles in a manner that is aligned with their political ideology. Print media is allowed to do that. Televised media is not. It's no different to some of the practically libelous things that Wings Over Scotland writes... and that's fine too.

People are saying 'this is piss poor journalism, typical of the current Telegraph' not 'The telegraph is piss poor, this isn't to be believed'. You're mischaracterising half of the conversation. 

The telegraph should have printed it. They shouldn't have gone about it in they way that they have. They shouldn't still be sticking to their guns, as the case falls apart, and be selectively reporting snippets of the story to paint a certain picture. They should be asking the main actors for comment, not allowing their opponent to get backstabbing done. In short, they can't just say 'public interest' to excuse their poor performance. They have clearly been acting unethically here, and not because they printed the memo. 

As to your almost entirely unrelated example, the solution is simple. They print the story, say there was a denial, and pass the evidence to the police for an investigation. They then follow the investigation to see that it is not swept under the rug. A denial doesn't prevent them from printing. It never has and never will. I don't know why you keep bringing it up as though it amounts to an impassable roadblock. It does not. 


As to your continued whinging about being downvoted, whinging attracts down votes and no, if they speak for themselves they seem to be doing so in a language you don't understand. You misunderstand the arguments they're putting forward in the first place and you misunderstand why they are down voting you now.

The truth is, we do not have players with the skill to consistently win games like this. The more our talent craps the bed like this, the more I wonder how many changes need to be made for next year.

Well, you've hit the nail on the head. We *don't* have any identity and after the disaster of the H &amp; G ownership, we are pretty much starting from scratch and figuring out who we are and who we are going to be relative to the proud history that we have.

The long story short is that our poor ownership nearly destroyed the club and FSG is only just beginning to put the finances back in order and modernize the club with new sponsorships, evolving our brand globally, *finally* making serious steps forward to expand Anfield, develop our academy and our youth, attempt to have some sort of consistency in our front office and our management staff, etc.

On the plus side, the scammers probably didn't get the cheque into a bank on Saturday, and even if they did, it's Easter Bank Holiday. 

This is what I'd do if it were one of my elderly relatives:

* Set up a three-way call with her bank (because they won't speak directly to you), get the cheque canceled. I'd be extremely surprised if you can't get hold of someone. I can reach my back 24/7/365.

* Contact the police on the non-emergency number (101). 

* Get an approved local company to put some remotely accessible CCTV up, and an alarm if she's not already got one. I'd start with [TrustMark](http://www.trustmark.org.uk/local/the-vale-of-glamorgan/) and go from there.

* Contact Trading Standards via Consumer Direct (08081 566761)

(CCTV and an alarm should cost a damn sight less than the grand and a half she's paid out. Gimme an orangered if you need me to find someone to quote for cameras and an alarm. Not sure if my usual guy will go as far as Barry, but if needs be I'll find out.) 

Might need to sign her up for broadband if she's not already got it, but it's dirt cheap if you use a shitty provider like [Talktalk.](https://sales.talktalk.co.uk) They're shit, but if it's just for the CCTV, it should do the job. If she has Sky TV, then use Sky for the broadband instead. If not and you want a good provider that are competitively priced, check [PlusNet](https://www.plus.net).

While there may be possible legal repercussions for canceling a cheque for work already carried out, I'd say the balance of risk is in her favour.

http://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/en/working/business_support/trading_standards_news/rogue_traders/rogue_traders.aspx says that to sell goods door to door requires a license. I don't know if that applies to services, but it'd be worth inquiring about.

More generally, it sounds like she's vulnerable. You need to educate her as much as possible, and take measures to discourage people from targeting her in future. CCTV and an alarm are where I'd start. What are her neighbours like, and do you have any younger family in the area?

We have plenty of young, brimming with potential attacking players so why spend £20m on Markovic when we need players for now. On top of that we then had to skimp on a striker and signed Balotelli. If we had the £36m spent on those two for a quality striker who knows where we'd be. I like Markovic but we had Suso at the time and Ibe for the future as well as senior players who could play wide.

I do think we have the right manager, but our transfer policy is abysmal. If we can't reward our best players then we'll be an even worse proposition for potential transfer.

null,false,canard_glasgow,null,null,null,"Alex Salmond as already revealed the SNP plan for the next parliament. 

&gt; There has been discussion in recent days among Conservatives about whether Cameron should be prepared to negotiate with the SNP. The editor of the ConservativeHome website, Paul Goodman, suggested that Cameron could utilise “his First Mover Advantage as the serving prime minister . . . by coming to an arrangement with as many of the minor parties as he can, under which they agree not to bring down his minority government. This, in turn, would mean striving to come to one with Alex Salmond.”

&gt;But this is a non-starter. Salmond tells me that the SNP would not negotiate with the Tories, nor would it seek any compromise with them: instead, the SNP would act to bring down a Cameron minority government by voting against a Queen’s Speech. “The Tories would have to go straight effectively for a vote of confidence, usually the Queen’s Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course, and we’d be voting against,” he says. “So if Labour joins us in that pledge, then that’s Cameron locked out. And then under the [Fixed-Term] Parliaments Act that Westminster parliament’s passed but nobody seems to have read, you’d then have a two-week period to form another government – and of course you want to form another government because this might be people’s only chance to form another government.”
Would he expect Ed Miliband still to be Labour leader at this point? 

&gt;“I have no idea,” he says. “But somebody will be. I mean, one of Labour’s big fibs – there are a number – but one of them has been that the party with the most seats forms the government. No, the party that can command a majority in the House of Commons forms the government as Ramsay MacDonald did [in 1924] . . . so it’s the party that has the majority. And the Parliament Act reinforced that, because it limits the ability of the incumbent to dictate an early election, and puts more power in the hands of parliament and indeed in the hands of your [party].”

&gt;Some of those close to Salmond believe that, offered an opportunity – any opportunity – to become prime minister, Miliband would be prepared to enter into full coalition with the SNP even though he has said that he would not. “If I were him, I wouldn’t have ruled it out. I wouldn’t give an inch to the Tory press or to the Tory party . . . Nicola [Sturgeon, the SNP leader] has always said that she thought full coalition was unlikely. But she didn’t rule it out: she said it was highly unlikely,” Salmond says. “So all they’ve done thus far, all Miliband’s done thus far, is rule out something which has already been defined by Nicola as highly unlikely. You know, so it’s still highly unlikely.”

&gt;Unlikely but not impossible? “I think,” Salmond says, leaning in as if taking me into his confidence, “probable would be vote-by-vote [support for Labour], and possible would be confidence and supply. This arrangement is . . . a narrow range of policies, and a narrow range of supported votes, obviously: that’s confidence and supply. And then in turn, of course, there has to be an agreed number of policies . . . not like the full coalition, where you take responsibility for every dot and comma, but a narrow range of policies, in return for which you make it possible for the government to function – over a period of time. Vote by vote is what I faced as leader of a minority government in Scotland [from 2007-2011] . . .

&gt;“A confidence-and-supply agreement has a formality to it; what people can and can’t do. A junior partner in confidence and supply has to have very defined and limited objectives, but objectives that are hugely important to them, and to their electorate, and in our case to our nation.”

The good news is, you can lessen the hate — however marginally — by not being a douche. City fans are usually regarded as pretty mild mannered, and so neutrals tend to hate us *slightly* less than other big english clubs. 

So try not to be too hatable. You're off to a good start by apologising for being Canadian.",null,0,null,1428287899,null,0,1428321907,0,cq2klpz,null,t3_31l2rm,null,t1_cq2klpz,null,t3_31l2rm,null,null,null,1432219446,null,54,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,54,null

Ok, well Man U managed to bring in Di Maria for Gods sake, and yes I know they are Man U, but don't for a second think Liverpool don't have a very very large brand value, because they are one of the most well known teams in the world. 

Liverpool can, no question afford to blow a ton of money on a great player and pay inflated wages. Just because there is 8 teams with more money, does not mean there won't be players available. 

Some, maybe even most players care about money far more than playing in Europe - and thats not even considering the fact that Liverpool will be aiming next season to try and qualify for the champions league anyway. I mean we're not exactly QPR over here. 

If Liverpool wanted to go out and sign a very good player (not world class like Messi, Ronaldo etc) they would be able to locate players more than willing to play with hope of qualifying for the champions league on bloated wages, over definitely playing in the champions league on lesser wages. 

The only reason this won't happen is FSG and Rodgers not wanting to sign players like this. Rodgers always talks about young players to mould, and players having the right character.. ageing mercenaries are not something Rodgers nor FSG wants at the club.

All that is, was, or will be, yet she was also aware of her position within the building, her sense of self. This understanding, this mindset, this... realization occurs when one finally understands the concept of the Middle Path/The Way/Emptiness. “The aggregation of form is taken as the first basis for establishing emptiness” “The New Heart of Wisdom, pg.43”  She says that she feels like her head is going to explode. Hearing that, please consider this interpretation of what the mindstate is like:

""Suddenly, with a roar like that of a waterfall, I felt a stream of liquid light entering my brain through the spinal cord. Entirely unprepared for such a development, I was completely taken by surprise; but regaining my self-control, keeping my mind on the point of concentration. The illumination grew brighter and brighter, the roaring louder, I experienced a rocking sensation and then felt myself slipping out of my body, entirely enveloped in a halo of light. It is impossible to describe the experience accurately. I felt the point of consciousness that was myself growing wider surrounded by waves of light. It grew wider and wider, spreading outward while the body, normally the immediate object of its perception, appeared to have receded into the distance until I became entirely unconscious of it. I was now all consciousness without any outline, without any idea of corporeal appendage, without any feeling or sensation coming from the senses, immersed in a sea of light simultaneously conscious and aware at every point, spread out, as it were, in all directions without any barrier or material obstruction. I was no longer myself, or to be more accurate, no longer as I knew myself to be, a small point of awareness confined to a body, but instead was a vast circle of consciousness in which the body was but a point, bathed in light and in a state of exultation and happiness impossible to describe. -Krishna, Pandit Gopi, Kundalini: Path to Higher Consciousness (New Delhi: Orient Paperbacks, 1992), pps. 6-7 ""



The similarities you are touching on between The Doctor and Jesus are part of a bigger idea that there are universal concepts which define 'the' hero. These concepts, in their greatest form, would represent 'The 'Messiah' or 'The Greatest Hero'. Put another way, The Eternal Champion of the Greatest Story Ever Told. That said, the Doctor replies at one point to Rose saying that what she is experiencing is what he sees all the time.  This implies that he is Enlightened, as a Messiah would be.  It also explains why he doesn't have a name. The messiah has no name! Just as God has no name! Why does God have no name? Because a word is a lie. It's a symbol to represent an idea.  As Alan Watt's said, ""The word ""ring"" is not the same as [hits gong]."" Similarly, the word ""God"" does not embrace, for example, it's ever shifting nature (the ever shifting nature of the cosmos). Put another way, it doesn't illustrate all that god is through this symbol ""God"". This is part of the reason we have so many concepts for it. Nothing seems to be good enough: Brahma, Ra, Cronos, God, The Big Bang, Infinity, The Cosmos. etc. The uncalculated symbolism lacks God's true glory. All of our Gods, seperately considered, are too small.  If we combined our mythologies however... Similarly, the Eternal Champion would be just as undefinable as it would be, in some way, a part of every story. On the other hand, none of the names we give, even those such as ""Jesus"", can suffice to express what it we will gain from it, so our definition is automatically imperfect.  For the Doctor... ""The Predator"", ""The Oncoming Storm"" ""The Warrior"" etc.  Basically, look up Joseph Cambell's ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces"". It is a fantastic start towards the understanding of this idea from, what most on this website would consider, a more quantitative perspective. 

TL;DR- Why do so many love the Doctor? Why do people find meaningful comparison to Jesus? He's intentionally constructed as a messiah!

I agree. I believe we lost top 4 because he took six months to realize Gerrard at DM was losing us matches. Sakho being benched for Lovren for months just to save face and playing Sterling as a striker with teams that defended deep are just ridiculous decisions. 

I like Rodgers, I like his style of coaching and his ability to work with young players, but he plays favourites way too often and favours players he signed or pushed for. He was full of praise for Allen after a couple of good performances despite the fact he was awful for most of the season, but to this day has never a single positive thing about Balotelli. Balotelli can't play because he doesn't press, but somehow that's not a problem when Lambert or Sturridge play. He decided that a fit Sakho didn't even deserve a spot on the bench against Everton, I guess Toure and Lovren were just too good to drop. Markovic is always played out of position and then sacrificed when something goes wrong. Lucas should play whenever he's fit, he's the most important player in the team.

I don't want him gone, but I want to feel like the players really earn their spots on the team by their form in training and in matches.

&gt;

&gt;__Jean-Paul Marat__ (French: [ʒɑ̃pɔl maʁa]; 24 May 1743 – 13 July 1793) was a [physician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician), political theorist and scientist best known for his career in France as a radical [journalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist) and politician during the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution). His journalism became renowned for its fierce tone, uncompromising stance toward the new leaders and institutions of the revolution, and advocacy of basic human rights for the poorest members of society.

&gt;Marat was one of the most radical voices of the French Revolution. He became a vigorous defender of the *[sans-culottes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-culottes)*, publishing his views in pamphlets, placards and newspapers, notably his ""*[L'Ami du peuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Ami_du_peuple)*"", which helped make him their unofficial link with the radical, republican [Jacobin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobin) group that came to power after June 1793.

&gt;Marat was [assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination) by [Charlotte Corday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Corday), a [Girondist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girondist) sympathizer, while taking a medicinal bath for his debilitating skin condition. In his death, Marat became an icon to the Jacobins, a sort of revolutionary [martyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr), as portrayed in [Jacques-Louis David's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques-Louis_David) famous [painting of his death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Marat).

A few solid seasons at 5th place does not make him one of those managers. I think that to make top 4 anytime in the next few years we need to make it this year. If that doesn't happen, I don't see us being there for quite a while. We have nothing to attract top players over Chelsea, United, City, or Gunners.

We did well last season because Rodgers had a star on the roster who had already proven himself at Ajax and simply needed a kick in the arse. How often do players like that come around? Maybe once every 10 years? It's awesome we made it last year, but let's not delude ourselves into thinking that we were going to be consistently in the top 4 with that roster. We haven't been top 4 quality for a good five years, haven't won a (meaningful) trophy in 9, and haven't been a top European team in 20. Why would world-class players come to us with that recent record?

Like you said, though, ultimately it comes down to this year. If we make it, then maybe we have a chance at proving it wasn't a fluke. I still don't think it will make a difference in the eyes of top foreign players, but that's just my opinion.

null,false,lak47,lfc87,,null,"&gt; Although, I thought we'd finish more comfortably in 4th place.

Yup. This is what has been shocking. I'm not expecting us winning the league anyway with all the money flowing freely with the other teams. We need to live within our means and that, to me, is top priority. That said, we need to atleast push for being consistent in the top 4. We cant have a windfall season one time, and then look lost the next. Even during a transition, that is not good progress. 

&gt; we don't need a managerial overhaul

This I'll just disagree.

&gt; an overhaul in the squad.

You're right, and I'm not saying we do either. We dont need to add another 7 players. We need to add the 2 or so RIGHT players. The ones that will push us on. And by right I mean buying goals. And buying positions where we really need reinforcements. We dont need some kid who's lighting up some lower league. We have enough youngsters who will push in the next 4-5 years. We need men who can lead this team and grab games by the scruff of their necks. We lack steel and fight. That stems from having a young squad. Neither do we need luxury players right now. If we have wingers who are delivering, we dont need to splurge on someone who we dont need. That has to be later. What we need is to look at problem areas of the team, and do it without the forever-optimistic glasses. Plan for the worst of times. 

We have failed to do that. The transfer committee has failed to do that till now and a classic case is the DMF role. Somewhere in the middle of the season, the manager realises 'oh!!! my system works better with a DMF!!'  This cannot carry on. By not going for a DMF, you have essentially got the solution, but you dont have the tools to craft that solution. Lack of planning. Moreso, the DMF we have and who changed fortunes is injury prone. No planning. 

Strikers. Luis Suarez left. Luis Suarez was making the noises that he will leave during and before the WC. What did we do? Pin all hopes on a striker who is made of glass. What did we do? Went out and bought Ricky Lambert. And when it started going tits up, we make a panic buy. A tool that will not do the job I want it to, the way I want it to. Failure to plan. 

Defence. The committee goes out and says, AH! Dejan Lovren. We buy him. Mid-season, the manager discovers that he is not what we expected. So let me play my original CBs. It worked. Worked well. What would you call that? A waste of precious, precious money. Failure to plan and know strengths of your squad. You know you have bought Can, a versatile player who can fill in at CB. If Rodgers tells me he didnt know about that capability of Can before buying, then who the fuck and what the fuck are the scouts doing? Half assed reports? What then, justifies splurging 20 million on a defender who you knew would be a risk and hasnt played in a top team and has been hot and cold? What justifies splashing 20 million when you are going to have a Luis Suarez sized hole in the front of the team? Gambling isnt bad, gambling on positions that we desperately need to fill is good. Buy 2 strikers for 20 million. One may work, the other may not. But we gambled on a position that needed minor reinforcements. And we paid a heavy price. 

The manager. Where do I even begin. He looks totally, totally confused. Clueless may be apt, but I'll wait to use it till we finish somewhere below 5th or 6th. What is his plan? What does he want to play? How does he want to play? At LFC, you cannot experiment knowing the weight of the expectation and the history of this club. You are there to get results. You are expected to make things work. You are expected to deliver on 320 pages of bullshit that you wrote when you were interviewed. You are expected to have a plan. A plan that will cover contingencies like your stars leaving. Dont tell me you didnt plan for that, because if you didnt, you are a buffoon, an idiot of the highest order, just hiding behind an excuse of 'he left'. It's paper thin. And here, for the very first time since they took over, I will blame FSG. If they let this man off without questioning at the end of this year, I will have my doubts about them. I am not calling for a merry go round, never. I am calling for action before things become worse. I am calling for action of a long or short term nature. 

I cannot wait for this season to end. I want to see where this club is headed. I want to see what this manager is made of. I want to see next season begin which will bring out this mans true mettle (or not) and shut his blind supporters up, or shut me up for good about him.

Milner and Jovetic are most likely to leave so we should be looking for midfielders. In my opinion having 4 strikers is just too much for a team that fields a 4-2-3-1 as the strongest lineup. Agüero, Bony and Dzeko are more than enough. If Dzeko leaves we should promote a youngster like Icheanacho. 

Navas and Nasri should be sold since they aren't getting any better and we should cash in given the opportunity.

Fernando looks worse everytime he plays. Frank is leaving. Yaya isn't what he used to be last season and like Dinho they aren't getting any younger. (Dinho is actually pretty decent right now, don't get me wrong. I love the man)

So that leaves us to try to get as many midfielders as we can. Lopes should be heading back here next season so that's a mid off the list. 

Verrati, Depay, Schneiderlin, Ward-Prowse, Khedira, Kondogbia and De Bruyne look like moves that could actually happen. 

Vieira is doing a great job in the EDS. Maybe we should give him a year or two there, and then upgrade him to assistant.

&gt;

&gt;&gt;*This article is about the history of academic [Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus) research. See [Historical Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Jesus) for the discussion of the historical evidence of his existence, and [Portraits of the historical Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portraits_of_the_historical_Jesus) for portraits of his life. For the book by [Albert Schweitzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Schweitzer) see [The Quest of the Historical Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quest_of_the_Historical_Jesus).*

&gt;The __quest for the historical Jesus__ refers to academic efforts to provide a [historical portrait of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Jesus).  Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during each specific phase.    These quests are distinguished from earlier approaches because they rely on the [historical method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_method) to study biblical narratives. While [textual analysis of biblical sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_criticism) had taken place for centuries, these quests introduced new methods and specific techniques to establish the historical validity of their conclusions. 

&gt;The enthusiasm shown during the __first quest__ diminished after the 1906 criticism of [Albert Schweitzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Schweitzer), who pointed out various shortcomings in the approaches used at the time. The __second quest__ began in 1953 in the middle of it and introduced a number of new techniques, but reached a plateau in the 1970s.  In the 1980s a number of scholars gradually began to introduce new research ideas,   initiating a __third quest__ characterized by the latest research approaches.  

&gt;While there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus,   and a basic consensus on the general outline of his life,  the portraits of Jesus constructed in the quests have often differed from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.   There are overlapping attributes among the portraits, and while pairs of scholars may agree on some attributes, those same scholars may differ on other attributes, and there is no single portrait of the historical Jesus that satisfies most scholars.

null,false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,null,"Hey, first off, thanks for reading. I'm a bit long-winded as you can see, but hey, I consider myself a bit of a writer and writers are pretty pompous and feel as if what they have to say is pretty important and/or interesting. Lol. :)

&gt;Sadly, I think you've nailed it here:

Right then. But what else can we do at this point? New ownership? New manager? New players? Overhaul the squad?

Then we run into the same problems again: What is the identity of the new ownership? The new manager? The new players?

One thing that I can say is that for the first time in a long time, there's actually some sense of stability following the instability of the Moores/H&amp;G era.

I feel as if our new American overlords came in and said did all the right things:

* Spent money to show that they had the money.
* Did their best to embrace the game and the football culture in Liverpool.
* Hired Kenny Dalglish.
* Had the boldness to sack Dalgish.
* Then had the respect to bring back Dalglish to the club.
* Hired Brendan Rodgers who also has said and done the right things, honoring Our History (red nets, etc) but also fighting to bring LFC to modern times (progressive training practices, progressive medical staff, focus on mental health, etc) and re-establishing and believing in the youth system.
* FSG has leveraged the pre-existing popularity of the LFC brand to gain more sponsorships, create relations with American and Asian audiences.
* After years of false-starts and broken promises by Moores and H&amp;G, FSG carefully studied the best options and decided to expand Anfield and did their best to keep the local community in mind as well. Thusly, Anfield will expand from about 45,500 seats to 59,000 (!) by the 2016-17 season. It's happening.

Has FSG or Rodgers been perfect? No.

But is there finally a sense of stability and a sense that LFC will start to do the things business-wise that is befitting the size of our club and our well-established global popularity.

And there is something to be said about FSG's stubborn attitude, their refusal to over-spend after their early mistakes, their refusal to have a knee-jerk reaction and sack Rodgers, their seemingly thick-headed adherence to a ""transfer committee"" and a ""transfer policy.""

Right or wrong, they are standing for *something* rather than just reacting.

And while the transitional period is frustrating, I am reading between the lines and seeing the foundations of a character, a philosophy, an identity.

And the foundations that FSG are building seem to suggest to me that they are putting a lot of thought into *long-term* future of the club.

And after the inability of David Moores to modernize with the creation of the Premier League and after the unmitigated disaster of the H&amp;G regime,  I have to take some consolation that we're at least heading in the right direction.

To use the over-used quote from Batman, FSG represents ""not the hero we deserved but the hero we needed.""

And, besides, the alternatives are either not enticing enough or will result in starting over and transitioning once again.

For better or for worse, we're stuck with what we have. Therefore, I can only hope for the best, support the club, and hope for a little bit of luck to help us along our way.

But all the being said, it's not as if I'm suggesting that I'm content to wait for years and years. Far from it.

Basically, since last summer I figured we'd stumble (though, not this bad) and this would be a transitional season.

However, in the 2015-16 season, I expect *a lot* from the players, the club and the manager. First and foremost, I expect us to comfortably secure a Champions League spot, whether it's 4th place or winning the Europa League. And I expect that Champions League spot to be secured relatively consistently for years to come.

To me, 2015-16 is the make or break season for the squad and Brendan Rodgers. If 4th place seems out of reach by January, I will support a managerial change, and/or a significant addition or two to repair whatever that is going wrong at that time.

Frustrated? Yes. Disappointed in this season? Yes.

But I refuse to announce the falling of the sky until, say, the new year. Haha. :)",null,0,null,1428298845,null,0,false,0,cq2plew,null,t3_31gshv,null,t1_cq2plew,null,t1_cq2o7ra,null,null,null,1432221798,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

&gt; I want to see next season begin which will bring out this mans true mettle

Completely agree with that.

As for the goals/defence argument...

What we saw last season with the philosophy that a ""good offence will be the best defence.""

That was nice when Suarez and Sturridge scored 52 goals in the league and when we scored 101 goals over the season.

Hell, even without the 31 League goals from Suarez, you would still think Daniel Sturridge can plug in 20+ goals a la Harry Kane.

Then the worst case scenario happened: A Sturridge injury. And not just the usual Sturridge injury but the he's-pretty-much-a-non-factor-all-season sort of injury.

We were fucked when Suarez left; We were doubly fucked when Sturridge was injured for most of the season.

(Though, isn't the silver lining that we were *this* close to battling for 4th after losing 52 goals?).

Shockingly, at our pace now, we're probably only going to score ~55 goals by the end of the season.

This wasn't how it was supposed to be.

It's pretty clear now that Rodgers believes a good defence is a good offence.

And without the offence, well, that exposed the state of our defence. A defence that is, well, OK when you have the likes of Suarez and Sturridge and Sterling firing on all cylinders. But a defence that is prone to crucial mistakes when pressured.

I think the biggest outcry is, ""Why the fuck did FSG, Rodgers and the committee not plan for a Sturridge injury?""

First off, hindsight is 20/20.

Everyone expected Sturridge to be injured (hence, Rickie Lambert). But the worst happened and Sturridge was out for weeks, months, pretty much the entire season (hence, fuck me, Lambert???).

I can fault and praise Rodgers for many things, but I can't fault him for not preparing for a long-term Daniel Sturridge injury.",null,0,null,1428299504,null,0,false,0,cq2pt33,null,t3_31gshv,null,t1_cq2pt33,null,t1_cq2ox50,null,null,null,1432221898,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

If that's not what you meant, kindly ignore the rest of this reply.

I listed three things that do matter materially.  And furthermore, ""what we play for"" is not limited strictly to material goals.  Disagree if you want, but remember that ""pride"" is a very common answer to the question ""what are we playing/fighting/arguing/competing for?""  So I think anyone who wants to limit it strictly to material things is in the minority.

OP is clearly assuming that trophies and qualifications are concluded (at least for us), and is suggesting that there is nothing *else* left to play for and that the season is ""effectively over.""  The clear implication is that the rest of the actual season doesn't matter, just going through the motions so to speak, and *that* implies that trophies and qualifications are the only things that do matter (or are ""worth playing for"").

I am taking issue with all of this, and answering with four things that are worth playing for in a very real sense.

I'm in the US, and the same thing is happening to some of the state schools here. The Chinese students are allow to party, cheat do whatever and kept only because it's a nice steady revenue source. Meanwhile in China, any schools with ""State University"" in their name are met with raised eyebrows and extra screening. Which is unfounded, since there are good state school.

Thanks. :)

As you can see, I'm not a fan of knee-jerk reactions and choose to think a bit more deeply about our club especially since we're not at a point where a managerial change here and there or a transfer-in/out here and there will be the answer. Unfortunately, the challenges that we face are much greater than that.

Though, like any supporter, I am prone to the outcry during a match thread. So you'll have to excuse me there. Haha.

&gt;I agree. When I will question them is if things are not OK by next season and they still persist with Rodgers. And, atleast, they need to ask some tough questions of Rodgers this year end.

Precisely.

This is why I roll my eyes at the crys for ""Rodgers Out"" and ""such and such player OUT"" and ""such and such player IN.""

I think Rodgers and the squad have bought themselves some time with our magical 2014-15 season. This is why I made the conscious decision last summer to give Rodgers and our squad some leeway *this* season.

However, as I've said before, the 2015-16 season is the ""make-or-break"" season because at that point, I won't accept the ""excuses"" of, ""Oh, he's young/inexperienced,"" ""Oh, he's an international player bedding into the English/Liverpool culture and style of the Premier League.""

Why? Because I think by the start of the 2015-16 season, it's time for our players to put-up or shut-up, no matter their age.

Bear with me here as we glance at some of our core players:

Jordan Henderson

* 2011-12: He's shit.
* 2012-13: He's not as shit as we thought.
* 2013-14: He's indispensible!
* 2014-15: And now he's scoring goals! Oh, captain. My captain!

Philippe Coutinho

* 2012-13: Wow!
* 2013-14: Wow. Kinda. I guess.
* 2014-15: Oh, wow!

Raheem Sterling

* 2012-13: Relax, he's young.
* 2013-14: Wow! What a season.
* 2014-15: Why isn't this 19/20-year-old kid not carrying the club? You're asking for *how* much money? What cheek!

Daniel Sturridge

* 2012-13: Brilliant!
* 2013-14: OMG!
* 2014-15: Shit. He's injured. And for a long time.

For success in the 2015-16 season -- and for our conversation and our worries to be completely irrelevant (haha) -- I expect the following:

* Henderson needs to make yet another step forward. I know it's unfair or even unreasonable to place statistical expectations upon a player but I do expect 10 goals/10 assists in the League. And, more importantly, timely goals at that. And if he falters, I won't accept any excuse that references the ""pressures of the captaincy."" He has progressed wonderfully, has captained the U21s and surely expects and accepts that he will be captain next season. He deserves these expectations because he has developed quite well.
* I am quite sensitive to the ""human"" qualities of a foreign player. England is quite a far cry from Brazil, Spain, Italy. However, with the fatherly hand of Lucas and Luis Suarez and two full seasons under his belt, Coutinho also needs to take the next step. Again, with the understanding that statistical expectations are dangerous, I think 8 goals/15 assists isn't out of the question.
* Yes, Raheem Sterling is only 20-years-old, but he also has set some high expectations because of his talent, his performance, and his wage demands. Fine. You want the money? Show me. And I think 2015-16 could be that break out year. I know some supporters bristle at any comparison of Sterling to Theo Walcott but I think it's somewhat fair and, at least, a decent place to start. By the end of the season, Sterling will approach 100 Premier League apearances and currently has 6 goals and 10 assists. In the season Walcott played 100 League games, he finished with 8 goals and 11 assists. The following season, Walcott had 14 goals and 13 assists. Therefore, I don't think it's out of the question to expect similar numbers from Sterling next season.
* As for Daniel Sturridge, well, touch wood and hope he stays healthy. That's all I want. And if he's healthy, I think things will fall into place  nicely for him and the squad.

For the Liverpool players who are new to the club but are older and have at least some Premier League or leadership experience, I think it's time they prove their worth next season: i.e. Adam Lallana (who hasn't been bad at all); Dejan Lovren; Sakho.

And if we get another step forward from the likes of Moreno, Can, Markovic and even some surprises from, say, Flanagan, Allen, Ibe.

And then add some fresh blood here and there... (Ibe? Origi? Wisdom?)

Then I think we'll be in good shape.

Once again, I fully expect all of these things to happen in 2015-16. And for the clearly intelligent Brendan Rodgers to learn from both the praise and criticism of this season and continue to progress forward as well.

Put all that together, add a splash of luck, and, well, I think we should fully expect a more consistent season and a Champions League spot (whether via Europa or a 4th place finish) and, heck, throw in a League Cup too.

Long-story short, I'll accept the missteps of this season as long as we see significant steps foward next season.

I suggest this because your post suggests that you have misunderstood a couple of the building blocks of investment. This is not a problem, as everybody was new to it once, but the danger of jumping head first into something you don't understand is that you get cold feet and give up at the wrong time.

The key question about equities is this: How much could you comfortably watch your investments fall by without running for the hills? 10%? 20%? 40%?

The FTSE 100 (a good proxy for the UK stock market) has, on average, fallen by 12.5% at **some point within every year** for the last 25. The worst year-on-year return in the last 30 years was in 2008 with a loss of more than 30%. Peak-to-trough there were much more severe losses.

My point is, if that kind of concept makes you nervous (don't just think of percentages, think about your investment plans, where the money has come from, and how much in pounds and pence you could lose in the above situation) and then temper that with lower-risk assets.

As for me, my pension (reasonably long timeline) is 80-90% equity, where-as my ISAs (3-10 year timeline) are 60% equity. I always keep a healthy emergency fund.

In my subject (maths), there is also a difference in quality. Some supervisors are better than others, and the better ones (or at least the most experienced ones) tend to be at the more established colleges. But that's a general trend, and doesn't mean all the supervisors at college A are better than all those at college B. And for many subjects, particularly in 2nd and 3rd years, supervisions are arranged centrally anyway.

Also, Tompkins has a strong emphasis on firsts. Subjects that tend to give a higher proportion of firsts (such as maths) tend to be more subscribed by men rather than women. Hence the female colleges suffer somewhat.

But the main factor is popularity. More popular colleges get first pick of students, and so get better results. Lucy Cav is relatively undersubscribed.

Given that English people can't vote for the SNP, and are unlikely to want to (because they're not Scottish Nationalists), it hardly seems likely that they would be overwhelming google with search queries.  Far more likely that it was Scots doing the googling.

The journalist, and you it would appear, are choosing to believe that the ""...if I live in England"" was part of the query, but it wasn't.  There's no evidence to suggest that people in England are asking that question.  That's not to say that people *aren't* asking the question, just that there's no evidence either way, contrary to what the headline is implicating.",null,0,null,1428308083,null,0,false,0,cq2ryuh,null,t3_31c5fx,null,t1_cq2ryuh,null,t1_cq2rknw,null,null,null,1432222986,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt;the use of the term 'African origin' makes me wary. I would take that to mean immigrant/born in Africa, but it may mean to you what I consider ethnicity.

""Immigrants of African origin"" is a clumsy phrase that refers to a collection of very different groups of people who have recently come here from different parts of a vast continent for very different reasons. 

&gt;the original report says there has been a decline in new diagnoses of HIV since 2004, which is hopefully a good thing

Good news indeed.  We don't know exactly why. Tighter border controls? Better HIV treatment in Africa? 

&gt;  I would also support cost-effective testing of everyone immigrating for various virulent diseases, but I wouldn't make it a condition of entry.

Yes, a difficult question. Personally I'd see HIV as good grounds to refuse certain types of long-stay visa, but that seems to fall foul of anti-discrimination legislation. 

One piece of good news from the report is that the number of onward HIV infections in the UK seems to be less than 0.5 per person bringing it in  (as deduced from the 60,000 estimated total heterosexual cases vs 40,000 estimated of ""African origin"".).

Given the choice, I prefer Staines &amp; Co's slapdash analysis, which at least invites correction, to the Independent's cry that the discussion just gets ""worse and worse"", which seeks to prevent any discussion at all.

Sadly, none of those things have happened.  We're arguably playing as badly now as we did at the start of the campaign.  None of Poch's signings other than Dier have worked out (and even he is more ""one for the future"" rather than the answer to our prayers right now), and we're in a perilous position where we have to convince Hugo, Jan and Eriksen that it's going to be worth sticking around for at least another year of rebuilding before we can accomplish anything.

Honestly, I would not be surprised to see us lose two of Lloris, Vert and Eriksen in the summer (not Kane... still too young and obviously loves the club), because arguably all three should be playing Champions League football by now (or in Jan's case, he thinks he should be).

And then what?  It's not a stretch to imagine us in the same position as AVB's second year, where the loss of a match winner has laid bare how mediocre the rest of the team is, results and performances become even worse until all confidence is shot and Poch becomes the next victim of Levy's trigger finger.

&gt;&gt;**Aston Villa Review: Episode 115 - Villa beaten at Old Trafford before the biggest week of the season**

&gt;Seven games to go and something in the region of seven points needed to secure Aston Villa's Premier League status for another year. In this week's show Chris and Steve examine the performance in Villa's annual defeat against Manchester United at Old Trafford and look ahead to what is arguably a crucial week in deciding Villa's fate.

&gt;Villa host Queens Park Rangers on Tuesday night with the Rs having been gifted an opportunity to overtake Villa with a win. Tim Sherwood and Chris Ramsey face off for the first time and Villa must find a way to stifle Charlie Austin and get their own attacking players in the groove, lest relegation become a likelihood rather than a possibility.

Similar things have happened before, of course.

He was a good purchase given the information Baldini had at the time and what he had been ordered to buy. In hindsight, of course, he has been out of form for a couple of years and hadn't acclimatised well to England, but there was no reason for Baldini to expect that. The unfortunate truth is that strikers are always risky purchases, and without champions league football you are limited in the players you can get. I don't think that Baldini should get the blame for Soldado, he was just an investment that didn't pay out.

Regarding Lamela; young, talented, Argentinian international in a position that we needed cover for as Lennon was aming and Townsend yet to emerge properly. 15 goals in 33 games the season we bought him. Undoubtedly a magnificent prospect who showed enormous potential and was expected to go on to great things. Not only this, but his team missed out on the champions league, providing an exceptionally small window of opportunity for us to snap up someone who looked like they were going to be amazing. Again, a gigantic risk, but one which had the potential to pay off in a big way.

He signed two expensive players in positions we needed them, and both had the potential and the ability to move us up that one stage more that Spurs needed at that time, and there were no better options easily available to him. They were good purchases that didn't pay off.

I think rather than blaming Baldini for the players we should blame the managers and coaches that failed to get their talent out of them.",null,0,null,1428310956,null,0,false,0,cq2sj2r,null,t3_31ks5s,null,t1_cq2sj2r,null,t3_31ks5s,null,null,null,1432223251,null,22,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,22,null

Some, dare not to say many, think that being on a good run means it's very likely that we're gonna win the next game and when we don't perform it's because we fucked up somewhere badly and someone is to blame. 

But that good run we were on from middle of December to middle of March was again bit of performing over our means. We could only put together those runs when we're on top form and it's almost impossible to hold that form for longer than we did this season or even last season, especially when considering how small and inexperienced our squad is compared to others. There were several signs that we were starting to slow down before those defeats and it is completely normal. We just didn't have the means to sustain such a good form. 

We closed the 10 point gap with United at the time when they were in very decent form. When we got so close, I know there's an expectation to just go past them but when we take a look at the state of our squad at the current moment - it's just unrealistic.

Two things 

1) Tokyo crashed during Japan's credit crunch in the 90s. Everyone said exactly the same things as you prior to the bubble bursting. 

Please read, it is eerily similar to London.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_asset_price_bubble

&gt; The 1985-1991 asset price bubble affected the entire nation, though the differences in the impact depended on three main factors: the size of the city itself,[11] the geographical distance from Tokyo metropolis and Osaka,[11][12] and the historical importance of the city in the central government’s policy.[6][11] Cities within prefectures closer to the Tokyo metropolis experienced far greater pressure in the asset prices compared to the cities located in prefectures further from Tokyo metropolis.

&gt; By 1985, lands within Tokyo commercial districts were unable to fulfill the market demand. As a result, land prices in Tokyo commercial districts increased sharply within a year. Average per 1 sq. metre for lands in Tokyo commercial districts in 1984 was 1,333,000¥ (U$5,600 assuming in 1984 that 1 U$=238¥).[10] In just a year, average per 1 sq. metre for lands in Tokyo commercial districts increased to 1,894,000¥ (U$7,958 assuming in 1985 average 1 U$=238¥).[10] This roughly translate to an approximately increase of 42%/sq. metre over just a year.

&gt; The first sign of a possible bubble collapse appeared in 1988. By this time, non-prime land prices in Tokyo had reached their peak, though some areas in the Tokyo wards started to fall, albeit by a relatively smaller percentage.[3] Prime land in Ginza district and areas in Central Tokyo continued to rise.[3] Urban land in other cities, at this point, remained unaffected by the situation faced by the Tokyo metropolis. In Osaka, for instance, the commercial land and residential land prices had increased by 37% and 41% respectively




-----



Burst

&gt;The asset price burst seems to exert a great effect on the overall Japanese economy. By 1992, the urban land price nationwide declined 1.7% from the peak.[10] However, the impact are worst for land in the six major cities as the average land prices (commercial, residential, and industrial) dropped 15.5% from its peak.[10] Commercial, residential and industrial land prices dropped 15.2%, 17.9%, and 13.1%, respectively.[10]

&gt;The entire asset prices crisis was far worst especially in large business districts of Tokyo. **By 2004, prime ""A"" property in Tokyo's financial districts had slumped to less than 1 percent of its peak, and Tokyo's residential homes were less than a tenth of their peak
**


-------------

My second point, in the next 20 years we will see a transport revolution, more and more automated cars will be on the road. Tesla already has their 'Autopilot'. 

At the moment the extreme prices in London are often located within 1 mile of transport stops. This is because people want to walk to the tube, imagine whether people will want to live walking distance to a tube when an automated car can do most of the work for you?

&gt;

&gt;The __Second Battle of Copenhagen__ (or the __Bombardment of Copenhagen__) (16 August – 5 September 1807) was a British bombardment of [Copenhagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen) in order to seize the [Dano-Norwegian fleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dano-Norwegian_Navy), during the Napoleonic Wars. The incident led to the outbreak of the [Anglo-Russian War of 1807](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Russian_War_(1807%E2%80%9312\)), that ended by the [Treaty of Orebro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Orebro) in 1812.

&gt;The attack gave rise to the term to [*Copenhagenize*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagenization_(naval\)).

Most of the fans (or that's what I think) still thought there's no way he's gonna be sacked. Now people are criticising them for not making a miracle happen? Frustrating that it didn't happen, but it's unfair, I feel. 

It's true, we need to be more consistent over the season, but that's the hardest part. Can't have so many ""single point of error"" teams like we have had. This season it was Sturridge, under Rafa it was Torres (and Gerrard as he was out for a fair share). And for that we need a better squad. Under FFP we can't just buy a better squad, we have to build it over years. It's telling that our (probably) most productive player over the season has been Sterling who is very inconsistent but has plenty of potential. 

That season was never gonna be something special. We had the target to make top 4 at best and have a real go at winning a cup. But the season was heavily handicapped by not figuring out the striker's position in the summer. We should've been more ruthless. Something could've been done to convince Borini to leave, surely? Someone else than Balotelli was on our shortlist, surely? Messing up the transfer of a decent striker has to be one of the biggest fuck ups in recent history. Up there with the transfer of Carroll.

null,false,bcash,null,null,null,"&gt; There is much debate on the damaging effects porn can have on children or people who have yet to form a psychological bond with someone

The anti-porn reasoning from the days of the printing-press onwards was that exposure to such material would somehow ""deprave and corrupt"" the reader, with the implication being that such depravity and corruption would lead to an increase in real-life sexual violence.

But history has, despite that, shown no such thing.  There hasn't been a prosecution against the written-word under the Obscene Publications Act in decades (except one bizarre case of some-one writing very strange fantasies involving the members of Girls Aloud, and even he was found not guilty).  The range and explicitness of acts allowed in R18 videos has also increased over the years.  And, of course, foreign produced porn over the internet is almost entirely unregulated, and has been flowing into homes for decades now.  And the world hasn't ended, the streets are safe to walk at night (if anything, they're much safer than they were).  Of course there are still too many sexual offences, and if you include new offences (grooming/stalking/etc., which can't be included in like-for-like comparisons because they weren't counted before) the total has increased.

So instead the debate has moved to ""effects"" on ""attitudes"".  I use scare-quotes to highlight that both of these are weasel words with no concrete definitions.  ""Our study shows that porn turns users into sexually frustrated young men.""  The correlation between porn use and sexually frustrated young men is undeniable, but it doesn't prove a causal relationship.

I'm not saying there's no ""effect"" on ""attitude"", because, well, everything has an effect on everything; and I'm not qualified in psychology to make any judgement.  My point is that there is a surprisingly large number of modern-day Mary Whitehouses, and studies published by them are, not surprisingly, pre-selected for their conclusion.

It may be that such studies are valid, but the existence alone doesn't prove that, not without independent verification and similar studies against control groups, etc.  One report which was cited a few years ago claimed that ""25% of porn users believe rape to be sometimes justified"", this was and still is a shockingly high number and, of course, the anti-porn lobby leaped on it.  The problem was, the same report found that 24.9% of non-porn users also believed rape to be somewhat justified.  The report was showing something very shocking, but yet it's lessons were not learned because people used it as a stick against pornography specifically, rather than looking into the root cause of attitudes across the spectrum.

Lallana, for all his injuries, is only a squad player if you're comparing us to City. Adam Lallana is a top player who almost always contributes something positive, even if it isn't a STAT. 

You fail to mention Emre Can. Also signed. You fail to mention Albert Moreno. Also signed. 

Markovic has, in no way, been a wrong man. He has been a young man and he has shown signs of brilliance without the level of finish we might need from a man worth his coin but if City, who you have to be comparing us to if you're talking about Lallana as a squad player, signed him for the same amount you'd hear no one squawking about him being a wrong man. He has pace, he has shown an eye for a pass, he can dribble by anyone on his day (at his age), and he's going to get better. 

To say Marko was a mistake signing is fine. I don't disagree that BR and the committee was negligent in the middle of the park, but I also don't know if we could sign players who were slam dunks there. I just don't know between fees and wages. We got Marko and I'm still sure he can be a massive influence for us. Ibe was not ready. Even at Derby he was not proven ready. And in his time for us it's mostly been overblown ""the next England star"" talk. He played very well. But he didn't set the world alight. 

""If we can't reward our best players"".

Are you seriously telling me you think Raheem is worth what has been quoted? Rodgers, say what you will, is absolutely right that if Raheem gets the mansion right now he's going to mail it in. And who will be stupid then when we have the next Shaun Wright-Phillips on our hands? The thing is there's no proof right now that Raheem couldn't go either way. Either way my argument (and Rodgers) could be proved wrong. But we just don't know. And that's the fucking point.

As for Lovren? Well Lovren clearly has confidence issues and we already had Sahko. I think that was a dumb signing but I expect that falls on Rodgers. I also think it's fair to say Lovren has gotten hardly any shots in our 5-2-2-1 situation and if he had we'd be having another conversation. 

As for Balo...........

NO FUCKING SHIT. He was bought because no one else was. Rodgers clearly didn't want him. That was obvious from the press and every moment since. But Balo, not unlike Andy Carroll, will probably still be sold for a decent fee just because he's Balo. Sure maybe we'll loan him to some Italian team next year with a loan-to-buy but they'll still buy him because his lazy ass is perfect for Series A. And we'll probably have made a 3 million pound loss all told.

He didn't say a 'secular government/state', but 'society', which generally, people do act in accordance with, following the dwindling amount of people who practise Christianity, let alone call themselves Christian in name culturally to affirm to the 'Christian white Briton' ideal. And fewer young, and even people of some of the previous generations who, I'd say, lived the substantial part of their youth in the 1960s onwards, don't affirm to this at all. Even my father, the son of a Church of England vicar.

I'm not denying the influence our Christian past had and continues to have, but I disagree with your implicit assumption of secular referring to the separation of government and religion implicitly. Christian values appear to, at least, hole much greater influence in the USA as opposed to the UK, where abortion isn't considered an election-breaker.

Miracle? Sorry, but that's not it. If I fail to meet my targets and then reach 75% and then stutter, that's not a miracle. That's failure.

&gt; Under FFP we can't just buy a better squad

It wont happen till we start winning. No players are going to come to us unless we can prove to them WHY they should. For that, you need to hit the transfer market just right considering our financial situation and buy someone who can help you win. Put credit to your clubs name so you can bank that once the transfer window comes by. But for the love of all that's holy, surely, surely we can do better than Ricky Lambert. Surely. 

&gt; we have to build it over years

Suarez left. Most of the team is intact. Admitted, that's a lot of goals to replace, and not expecting the team to replace them all anyway. We couldnt even buy someone who could put away a fraction of those. Speaks volumes about our transfer business. Sturridge? Yes. But you need to REPLACE players. This is not some sort of lifetime saving scheme. We needed a sofa, we bought a lamp, to paraphrase the great man. 

&gt; But the season was heavily handicapped by not figuring out the striker's position in the summer. We should've been more ruthless. Something could've been done to convince Borini to leave, surely? Someone else than Balotelli was on our shortlist, surely? Messing up the transfer of a decent striker has to be one of the biggest fuck ups in recent history. Up there with the transfer of Carroll. At least he was a panic buy because we had to buy someone in the space of a day. No excuse of having a whole summer and not getting a striker that has attributes that complement our team.

Couldn't agree more. There are questions to be asked. Sure, people may be going in too hard and heavy on Rodgers, but the questions you stated above need to be asked. Saying Suarez left is OK. Saying Sturridge got injured is OK. What did the club and moreso the committee do to rectify that?

null,false,JB_UK,null,null,null,"This is, I think, a good example of how Farage works as a political operator. The way he popped up with the statement without any prompting, I would be surprised if what he said wasn't polled and/or focus grouped beforehand. It's then deployed at a moment of high coverage, as if it was a spontaneous gaffe, and the comment plus the resulting outrage is guaranteed to get on the news. The level of coverage means that it reaches a significant proportion of the population (much larger than the 2-4 million that actually watched the debate), with a significant proportion of those people agreeing. Then rinse and repeat, because every time someone from Farage's constituency hears him say something they agree with but is being jumped all over, they get more alienated from the established parties and the 'metropolitan elite'.

In terms of reaching that constituency, Farage doesn't necessarily care about people disagreeing. In the short term it helps him get his message across - it may be more damaging in the long run, but bear in mind that you only need 35% of the 65% of the population who vote, in order to win a majority. If you can get 20% to 25% of the adult population to strongly agree with you, you will be in a position of some power.

The nature of the tactic is to try to break up the demographic/ideological coalitions that make up the established parties. Labour has always been a combination of more socially conservative workers and very socially progressive Fabianites. The Conservatives also have a faultline between the socially conservative shires and the more progressive metropolitan professional and executive class exemplified by Cameron. Both can be divided using the sort of culture war, identity politics you see in the US. The dividing line becomes social attitudes, not economic policy.

The best thing which could happen when Farage says something like this is a brief bewildered silence, then return to talking about his economic ideas. One of Farage's big aims at the debate will have been to avoid getting into too much detail on UKIP's economic policy, and limit himself to strong attacks on a handful of 'common sense' ideas like getting the deficit down, which have wide support outside of the Fabianite groups that already hate him.

Economic policy and attitudes towards privatization is his fault line, so if you want to do damage to him, that's what you need to talk about.",null,0,null,1428315331,null,0,1428316430,0,cq2tdcc,null,t3_31m131,null,t1_cq2tdcc,null,t3_31m131,null,null,null,1432223648,null,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13,null

HIV drugs cost about £25,000 per year per person, so a hypothetical immigrant would need to be earning over £90,000 for their taxes to cover that cost.

In total this accumulates to costs of £105m per year. Funding of the NHS in 2015/2016 is expected to be [£115,4bn](http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/overview.aspx). So the burden it seems is less than 0,1% (assuming the numbers are correct). Personally, I think it is a non-issue, but I guess that UKIP are fighting for the principle and not the numbers.

What bothers me is that the numbers Farage presented at the debate does not reveal how many of these people are ""healthcare tourists"" and how many of them have attracted the illness while in the UK.

west coast of scotland

If you want to hike for 1-2 weeks, definitely do west coast of scotland. I would suggest Glen Coe area. There's an old soldiers path that cuts straight through that area and then north towards Ben Nevis (highest mountain in the UK) and Fort William, they called it 'the devil's staircase'. 

It really depends what you want. west coast scotland is more barren (and in the winter more dangerous) and would involve camping mostly. Whereas the lake district is smaller, more populated and more popular. If you want impressive wilderness go for Scotland's west coast (the best spot imo is a little village called port appin, also places to see is the isle of skye, an'teallach, torridon, sisters of kintail, glen coe valley and buchail etive more, essentially along the west coast you will kind numerous lochs and hidden inlets next to giant mountains). Lake district i've visited more, it is more beautiful in my opinion if less impressive, more like hobbiton, it requires less effort to see more and you can take in better walks that are shorter, and unlike scotland isn't infected with mozzy's in summer, and the numerous lakes and hills and greenness gives it something.

To make it a bit more 'fancy' we could add some smoked salmon, I will explain later.

First boil a pot of water for pasta, normally it takes about 10/15 mins for pasta to cook properly. Now lets chop some garlic and heat up a frying pan adding some olive oil, and a bit of butter. Prepare broccoli and spinach (wash up and chop up to your liking).
Now add broccoli and spinach for about 3/4 minutes on frying pan, and than add creme creme fraiche, mix well and let it heat up for another 2/3 minutes. Now its time to add, if you choose too,a few bits of smoked salmon. Cook it for another 1 minute. 

Also, I like to mix in a few shreds of parmesan once the pasta is drained and still hot, than mix in your white pasta sauce with veggies, and enjoy.

I was able to buy all of the ingredients for less then £20 and that lasts, for myself only, for a few days. Its pretty fancy, too, with bits of smoked salmon. Oh, and that important bit it takes under 20 minutes to make. Enjoy :D:D:D

As you say, we played mysteriously negatively. Arsenal thrive on the ball, we all know that. They are one of the teams that most need the ball to achieve the rhythm where they operate most efficiently. Why didn't we deny them? Why did we play to their strengths at their own home ground?

We look tired. Maybe it's just that - we bought players to rotate who we don't seem to be using. We've played more games than last year, and it seems to have hit us. 

But then we have to ask ourselves what BR's plan was. Playing for the draw (or at least very defensively), hoping to engulf the Arsenal midfield in ours, leaving Giroud isolated up front in no man's land. Then hitting them on the counter, doing the swift transition that he loves so much. But that didn't work. They just pushed us back and exposed the gaps between our forward players and a confused midfield (they didn't seem to know what game they were playing). Instead of Arsenal's danger men being isolated and penned into pointless positions, that happened to us.

That's been my least favourite part of this season - watching that well-oiled offensive transition break down, time and time again. Watching teams quagmire our midfield, watching Sterling and Sturridge and Balotelli play in complete isolation sometimes. Watching teams smother us, seeming to have the wrong players in the wrong positions in the wrong spaces. So much of it is down to failing to replace Suarez, it really is. So much is down to youth, too. 

We all need we know firepower up front, and, I agree, a high-calibre central midfielder of experience. Somebody who can make a partnership with Hendo, somebody who Hendo can learn from, somebody who can control the tempo of the game, a bloody metronome.

My bf had the same thing happen. He contacted all of them and told them it was a previous renter and gave his name. I think some required proof so he copied his rental agreement to prove it to them. Seemed to resolve fairly easily.

In answer to your questions:

1. Call anyone you get letters from and explain before they come around.
2. Keep rental agreement in an easy to access place in case they come around (and maybe proof of identity, such as passport).
3. I assume the car is in your name so I doubt they would have the ability to just take it, but wouldn't hurt to keep proof of ownership.
4. I hope you took, and can prove, any meter readings from when you moved in, the letting agent should be able to help with this.

&gt; barring an unlikely shift in results 

You make it sound like we've been an out of form, struggling side. We haven't. It's true that we haven't really been playing our best football for four or so matches now, but we've only suffered two league defeats in the whole of 2015 and, for most of that, we were one of the most feared teams going into each match. We've certainly suffered two set backs, but what's important is that we kick on and get wins from here on out -- a feat that we're certainly capable of, given our destructive form for most of this calender year. 

Do I believe we can get top 4? Yes. It's unlikely but not an impossibility, and with 7 games to go, we just have to take each as it comes and aim for the 3 points. United have tough fixtures, City are complacent away from home...these are teams that could lose points, and we just have to make sure we're in a position to take advantage of that. 

This sub has fallen apart since the loss at Arsenal. Talk of Rodgers not being the manager we need, of players not being good enough, lamenting our form, and -- as always -- nostalgic one-liners about how last season went.

I believe Rodgers is a great manager who sees the talent in young players and make them great (Hendo, Sterling, Coutinho, Sturridge, Can, hell even Flanno last year). We can't ignore the fact that FSG and BR has kind of stabilized the club. We were in for the top 4 race a long time, and even a title race last year. Of course, the drought of trophies is frustrating. And ouf course, we can't ignore that BR has bought some players who are not good enough to be in a top 4 side.

Selling our best players doens't make it better.
The problem is, we don't have any manager lined up with great amount of experience and a great CV waiting to be our manager. That won't happen. We just have to keep Rodgers for now and hope for the best. A man like Gerrard with many trophies and awards in his career has been praising BR all the time.

Well, two things.

Firstly, it's provable that immigration doesn't reduce the amount of jobs available. For all the people that immigrate, they need the same services and whatever as the people that already lived here, so they increase demand too, in line with the jobs they perform.

Secondly, the fact that immigrants are underpaid and drive down wages *is* a big problem - none of the political parties (UKIP included) want to do anything to really address this, and for some, like the Tories, they are probably hugely in favour of it. Them and their buddies make a lot of money off the fact that wages are kept low.

Personally, I think what we need to combat that problem is a substantial hike in the minimum wage (no, not the £8 Labour is promising, more like £10-£15) and then lock it in with inflation.

I think we also need to do a lot more to make sure that people who move here are aware of their rights, and introduce serious penalties for the employers that don't pay the minimum wage.

EDIT: Found some http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-consequences/economic/

'Several investigators have evaluated the cost of obesity on an individual level. Finkelstein and colleagues found that in 2006, per capita medical spending for obese individuals was an additional $1,429 (42 percent higher) compared to individuals of normal weight. (7) Cawley and Meyerhoefer, meanwhile, found that per capita medical spending was $2,741 higher for obese individuals than for individuals who were not obese—a 150 percent increase. (1)

Thompson and colleagues concluded that, over the course of a lifetime, per-person costs for obesity were similar to those for smoking. (10) In middle-age men, treatment of five common obesity-related conditions (stroke, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, and elevated cholesterol) resulted in roughly $9,000 to $17,000 higher costs compared to normal-weight adults.'

Those 3 all have their disadvantages.
Bale is a great option, reports tell that he's unsettled in Madrid, he's homegrown and knows the league well, and most importantly he's a great player and will be a great addition. But, Madrid wont let him go for cheap, and his wage is very high, which is a big minus (FFP remember?).

Reus is an awesome player too, but I am not sure whether he'd like to leave Dortmund now after his contract extension. He won't be cheap either, and I am really concerned about his injury history, he seems to be injury-prone now. Not sure how fast he'll adapt in the league compared to other 2 options you mentioned.

Sterling is a big talent, he has a bright future, and he would really be an addition to our squad, plus he should improve a lot. But I don't like the rumours surronding him. I am not sure that everything people say about him being greedy is true, and I don't really know what salary he wants, but I don't want to risk having a player who is here only for the money. 2 seasons pass and he'll complain that he want to leave for Madrid/Barca/Whatever. Can we offer him the money he wants? Absolutely. Should we do that? Not sure. Besides, he's homegrown, so I would expect Liverpool will demand a high transfer fee, which could be spend on an established player, who's proven himself for several years.

So, I think Bale would be the best option, and Sterling is the most realistic one. Though if you ask me, I'd like to see Depay. He's young, should cost less than Sterling for ex., has a lot of potential and should not demand a ridiculous wage. But with United rumours surrounding him I am not sure he would have picked City. LVG as coach and RVP as sort of mentor for him, plus they'll pay whatever fee PSV wants (that's you FFP right here).",null,1,null,1428323702,null,0,1428324053,0,cq2vfhq,null,t3_31mae0,null,t1_cq2vfhq,null,t3_31mae0,null,null,null,1432224618,null,0,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,0,null

Malouda was a very good winger. I never would have put him up there as world class, but he always gave a very respectable return of goals and assists. Pacey, quick feet, though it always annoyed me that he had the skill but so often did not take on players as much as i would have liked. 7/10 for ability. 8/10 for impact and contribution.

Joe Cole is one of the most technically gifted players i've ever seen in a Chelsea shirt. If he could have remained uninjured for more extended periods of time, i honestly think he could have become a genuinely great number 10. But every time he seemed to reach full fitness and get into his stride, another injury. To this day, i can't remember who it was against, but he played an outrageous, perfect outside of the boot through ball from pretty much our own half that was just amazing. Could have been absolutely world class. never quite made it. Luckily, we had a lot of other world class players at the time. 8.5/10 for ability. 6/10 for impact and contribution.

Kalou was a funny one. WHen we signed Shevchenko and everyone was like ""this is it. we're going to be unbeatable,"" i made a bet with a friend that this new lad ""Kalou"" would do more for us than Shevchenko. Couldnt believe i actually called that one right. Anyway. He was always solid, but he had a real problem with drifting out of games and being essentially anonymous. Sort of similar to Malouda, but for me, he was never really consistent enough to be anything more than a solid rotation/bench option. Decent performances, but never great from the lad. Sentimentally didnt want to see him go, but he was never really good enough to be a regular in a title challenging team. Ability 6/10. Impact and Contribution 5.5/10

The cost of providing this healthcare is distributed over the entire taxpayer base. Therefore we as a society can afford it, even if the individual can't.

The disagreement, as I see it, is where to draw the line. You can provide health care to taxpayers only, citizens only, to anyone who is resident in the country, etc etc. I'm sure everyone recognises that we can't help everyone in the world who wants help. Given that our borders are open to the European Union, and we have tens of thousands of legal and illegal immigrants coming to our country every year from the rest of the world, I do not think it is affordable to provide care to any foreigner who gets into the country: we should restrict care to our own citizens. 

As it stands, if a foreigner contracts HIV, and they think they can get better treatment in the uk than they can in their home country, they have an incentive to come to the uk for free treatment. the uk should not have an obligation to take in a foreigner and provide them with expensive treatment just because it is good for the immigrant. Our country has to put our own needs first, and given the current state of our economy and the amount of cuts required to reduce the deficit (to say nothing of the national debt), it is crazy that we would welcome people who are such a burden on our NHS without hesitation.

Banning something is totalitarian, saying that you probably shouldn't do something, and we'll put things in place to encourage not to do the dangerous activity is fair when you live in a system where the state is then responsible for paying the costs of these damages.

null,false,Shaper_pmp,null,null,null,"&gt; Lib Dems would be stupid to enter another coalition government.

Why?  They'll never manage to gain an overall majority on their own, so the best they could ever reasonably manage would be a coalition.

I admit they've been naive and stupid in the present coalition and have likely been played expertly by the Tories (their successes underplayed and their ill-chosen compromises emphasised, with the result that they've already lost a lot of their newfound support by being seen to have betrayed a lot of their ""natural"" or most loyal demographics), but at this stage I suspect withdrawing from government with their current reputtion would merely seal their political irrelevance for another entire generation.

If they formed another coalition with Labour, however, it would give them time to finesse their legacy and rehabilitate their reputation a bit more.  Not only would they have a second crack at power (hopefully having learned something from their first disastrous attempt over the last few years), but they'd also find themselves in coalition with a much more ideologically compatible party, which would make it easier to advance their agenda and fulfill their manifesto pledges, as Labour wouldn't be able to as effectively obstruct them without acting against their own rhetoric and ideology.  More synergy and fewer questionable compromises, basically.

At the same time they might find they suddenly get a much easier time from their own base *and* a lot of the right-wing press (who are generally more interested in supporting the Tory party and obstructing the Labour party than they are in advancing right-wing causes over left-wing ones per se), as they'd be the spoiler-in-government, frustrating Labour's worse excesses and forcing them back towards a more centrist position.

At the same time, if they actually managed to demonstrate themselves reasonable, reliable and effective in government (as opposed to - as they're largely viewed now - a conservative glove-puppet and outrage-sponge on the high-profile issues and issues important to their base), they might even manage to steal some of the more centrist supporters of both the Labour and Tory parties, and begin to carve out a distinct niche for themselves in the middle of (or more accurately, somewhere outside of) the traditional left/right political spectrum.

null,false,WakingWoes,null,null,null,"&gt;describe someone who is working very very hard.

Workaholic.

&gt;describe someone who is very agressive and/or strict

In a professional environment somebody who is needlessly strict is often called a jobsworth. It comes from the phrase ""It's more than my job's worth"". I don't think there are any idioms for aggressive people when the words prick or knob might do.

&gt;proverb for ""just bullshiting around'"" ?

Fucking about or messing about.

&gt;to speak without reasons.  -&amp;gt; To shot one's mouth off ?

Putting your foot in your mouth, maybe? It's more to do with saying something offensive unintentionally, though.

&gt;old not so smart, female, a little like other ford for ""old silly cow""

Old biddy or old bat. An aggressive or confrontational old woman is sometimes called a battle-axe.

&gt;somebody is sexually active with all in one group , like ""fucks thrue all in the Office?""

Village bicycle - everybody has had a ride.

&gt;somethig for :"" this shit is so crazy, i cant believe it""

Harebrained can be used sometimes. It's used usually to describe people or their deeds, like ""that harebrained woman"" or ""another one of his harebrained schemes"".

&gt;another word for ""the big boss / the high tier Animal""

Governor, Dear Leader, also the man upstairs is a term for God which some people use sarcastically to refer to authority.

&gt;to make something realy bad / to fuck shit up.

To lay waste to something is to destroy it irreversibly. Also salting the earth. 

&gt;to humiliate somebody

To cut someone down or take them down a peg or two is to humiliate someone enough that you put them in their rightful place.

&gt;""something is in realy realy bad condition, something is realy realy bad""

In wrack and ruin is something that has already been destroyed and is now in ruins. Bedlam means that somewhere is in absolute chaos. Bedlam comes from Royal Bethlem Hospital which was founded in 1247 to take in the insane and would charge visitors to watch the patients wreak havoc. It has since been brought under good leadership and is now an acceptable hospital.

&gt;""somebody is cussing alot""

Foul-mouthed. 

&gt;""tell bullshit to somebody""

Talking shit or talking crap. 

&gt;""the black sheep"" ? somobody who is different then the rest

Black sheep is an English phrase, also scapegoat has a similar meaning. ne'er do well, pariah or leper also work. 

&gt;""behind the grid"" (to sit in jail)

Behind bars, staying at Her Majesty's Pleasure (or His Majesty's Pleasure if there's a male monarch on the throne). 

&gt;""somebody who is silly in his head ... little stupid"" :)

Simple-minded, simpleton, nincompoop, troglodyte, thick in the head, not-all-there, a few bricks shy of a load, not the sharpest tool in the shed, room-temperature IQ, the lights are on but nobody is in, as thick as two short planks, could lose an argument to an empty room, could fall and miss the floor, was absent when god awarded brains, no bats in the belfry, half-baked, if minds were dynamite they couldn't blow their hat off, etc.

&gt;""something very unbelievible, like ""horse with glases""

A turn-up for the books, out of the blue, a grey swan, not in the cards, once in a blue moon, when pigs fly.

&gt;""giant hunder, like ""bear hunger""

Could eat a horse, hungry as a wolf, your stomach thinks your throat has been cut.

&gt;""somebody who is making others rich, like the Golden Ass from brother grimms i think""

Cash-cow, golden goose, a gold mine, a meal-ticket.

&gt;""To have no money in your pockets, like your pockets are full of holes.

Deep pockets and short arms, too much month at the end of the money.

&gt;""stupid cow!"" (for females)

Bint, bitch, shrew, she-beast.

&gt;""female bitching around""

Tattletale, busybody.

&gt;this one is hard ... ""the dog is turning crazy in the pan"" mhmm. its like somebody is going crazy because of spezific sircumstances.

I don't think we have a direct equivalent to that, but ""if you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen"" means that if you can't handle a difficult situation, leave. 

&gt;they are hurting only small people and not touching the big ones.

""Pick on somebody your own size"" is probably the closest you'll get.

&gt;something turning into something completely different (a fish  is turning into a bird)

Kissing a frog means doing something that causes a transformation. It's from the Frog Prince, in which a princess is asked for a kiss by a frog who then turns into a handsome prince.
