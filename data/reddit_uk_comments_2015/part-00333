Alternatively we play a 4-4-2 diamond with Coutinho in the centre and either Can or Lucas at DM.

4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 for the other half of the season while Studge is broken. I'd actually go for the latter, as we have more personnel for it. It doesn't really ask for out and out wingers. Lallana and Moreno are our backup AMC/L respectively. Coutinho and Firminio are the first choices for those two. I'd take Markovic over Ibe on current form, but the two both need games.

Moreno though is our second choice LB/LM/LW. If we played a flat 4-4-2 or 4-2-2-2 he would be a good choice for the left if Coutinho wasn't available or could fit into another position.

null,null,Wolfgang_Wolf,null,null,null,"In terms of playing, basketball is by far the most popular of the four, mainly because it is taught in schools and also because of casual games. Ice hockey is probably next, mainly due to the youth systemsof the professional clubs. American football would probably be next, as most universities have a team. There are also a couple of very small non-university amateur leagues. In last place would be baseball, which has a small amateur league.


In terms of watching the domestic leagues, ice hockey wins hands down, with some of the top teams in the EIHL (Elite Ice Hockey League) attracting crowds in the low thousands every week. However, TV coverage is virtually non-existent, resulting in very few casual fans. Most British ice hockey teams exist seemingly on the edge of going bankrupt, caught in a trap of having to import players from abroad, mostly North America, just to keep up with everyone else. There is an import limit, which fluctuates in the EIHL at around  between 10 and 12. British ice hockey, judging from the few (mostly Cardiff Devils) games I've been to seems to suffer from an identity crisis, but I won't go into that here.


Basketball would be next, as it is also played professionally. Crowds for the amateur baseball and American football leagues basically consiist of some people standing on the edge of the field.


Finally, we come to viewership of the major North American leagues. The NFL wins this one I'd say quite easily, being shown on Sky Sports, and at mostly reasonable times, at least the Sunday games. The other three leauges suffer a lot from mostly being played in the middle of the night over here. There are also of course the games played at Wembley, which are very well attended. 
It is hard to judge what comes next, but it's probably the NBA. I think it's shown on BT Sport now, although it used to be on Sky Sports. The NHL and MLB take the bottom two spots. The NHL is shown on an obscure Satellite  channel called Premier Sports. The NHL and MLB used to shown on Channel Five, a terrestrial channel. However, Channel Five's signal was not strong in all areas of the country.  To watch NHL games when I was younger I used to set my alarm for about one o' clock creep downstairs, adjust and reposition the crappy indoor aerial to make Channel Five somewhat visible, albeit very ghosted and distorted, just to watch whatever game they got the rights to show. The game would finish at about four o' clock, then I'd go to bed so I could wake up for school at half past seven. It was madness.

Yes, probably.  The important thing is that you *must* go.  This is a criminal case and the court can issue a warrant for your arrest if you fail to appear in response to a summons.  This at least means that you will get a free lift to court from the police, although it will be via a cell for the night.

&gt;Would it be a good idea to follow up this case and take the rail network to court for not doing their job properly and putting an innocent person through stress?

No, definitely not.  What aspect of their job has the train company not done properly?  Someone was caught by a ticket inspector and gave fake details, and then when they sent you the letter, you ignored it rather than pleading your case.  What was the train company supposed to do about that?

Secondly, it's a criminal offence to fail to purchase a ticket.  I accept that you're innocent of that offence, but the train company is entitled to take reasonable steps to enforce the railway bylaws.

Tidy up the stray capitals - you have ""Sixth form"" and ""Sixth Form"" in the same sentence.  To be honest I think the only capitals actually needed there are the ones in Northumbria University.  And as /u/jayguazu suggested, it reads better with an 'and' to link 'sixth-form student' and 'aspiring economist'.

Add a space between the number and the grade each time.

In the education section, you've left a blank line between the institution and what you achieved there, while in the work section, you have the detail immediately after the company's name with no blank line.  Either style works, but be consistent!

&gt; Lead a study group for underachieving Year 9’s

It's in the past, so 'Led'.

&gt; Analyzed students mistakes and rectified them

The mistakes belong to the students, so put in the possessive apostrophe: students' mistakes.  Also, you're British - so [Analysed](https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/analyse?q=analyzed).  The Z spelling is American English.

&gt; Giving attention to details

I'd suggest ditching that one from professional skills - it's a very generic attribute that could reasonably be expected of anyone.

&gt; Excellent knowledge of computer programs (excel/word)

I'd reword that as ""Excellent knowledge of computer programs including Excel and Word"" - both to imply that there are other things you're good at beyond just those two, and also to correctly capitalise their names.  If you're thinking of office type jobs at all, it's probably worth spending a little time getting your head around PowerPoint too - like it or hate it (probably the latter) it's very heavily used!

&gt; Meeting deadlines

&gt; Following instructions

Not really sure I'd want to put either of those in as particular skills either, again they're standard attributes you'd expect (if you can't follow instructions you'll be about as much use to most companies as a condom machine in the Vatican).  Better to focus (and possibly expand upon) your less-common attributes, like mentoring and motivating.

A CV is not a place to demonstrate creativity. It's a factual summary of information.

Drop unnecessary headings. We know it's a phone number and an email address, you don't need to say so. We know it's background information, so don't say so, just go right in with

&gt; Aspiring economist, looking to further my education at Northumbria University after concluding sixth form education.

Don't mention age on a CV. Reduce the use of capitals: it's tempting to make everything Look Formal, but it Reduces Readability (especially if it's being scanned rather than read fully, as is likely).

'Education &amp; Qualification**s**', 'Hobbies and Interest**s**'

'Skills'. Not 'Professional skills',unless they were acquired in paid employment. Priorities the knowledge of common software, but also can you find ways to back this up? Either here, or in an interview. Similarly, try to thing of specific examples where you can back up your claims for 'Meeting deadlines' (never handed in coursework late, for example? Verifiable via referees, see below). *Definitely* drop the 'attention to detail' bit. Just one tiny typo elsewhere in the CV can make that look rather awkward!

Great that you've got specific experience to list, although again, I'd avoid calling it 'work' experience. 'Experience' is fine by itself.

Can you provide specific examples of what you've done, or specific numbers? How many people have you interacted with, how many have you helped? What specific successful outcomes could you point to? (The teacher(s) involved with the study group will *definitely* have specific data measuring progress of the pupils involved, they live and breath such data!)

References/referees: A reference is the document provided by a referee. Don't muddle the two terms up. Not all referees want their contact details sent out on CVs. Many specifically do not - they might end up with hundreds of spam emails from monster.com. 'References available on request' is acceptable, provided you really do have referees already agreed and willing to provide them in an appropriate timeframe.

Usual suspects are form tutor, head of year etc., but you could also draw on DofE staff, coach or management of your football team, and so on. Real-world confirmation that somebody is reliable, honest and hard-working is what potential employers are likely to be looking for from someone your age, and also evidence that you're able to interact with people outside of your immediate school/college peer group.",null,0,null,1440724212,null,null,false,0,cui56l1,null,t3_3img37,null,null,null,t3_3img37,null,null,null,1441540377,null,2,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

I think he is just lacking in confidence, and needs to strengthen his upper body.  Ibe can become a more useful winger if he realises there are nine other outfield players.  He is great 1 on 1, but more often than not, he will have no idea what to do with the ball after he goes past a defender.  He looks down when running with the ball, rarely looks for the pass.

The Frank Snr: A hammer that, although made for defensive purposes was often used for aggression. One of the more popular models that even led to a Frank Junior model being released (although this model has been recently used by American's).

The Rio: Another favourite who was strong, durable and always did the job. Recently been used by the Rangers of Queens Park who needed protection from a variety of aggressors.

The Reid: Using a mix of New Zealand and Danish expertise this defensive hammer has been the most recent and popular hammer used. Strong, quick and accurate - it is a highly sought after hammer. The hammer that is currently utilised on this list - will probably set you back about 9-10 million.

* English Breakfast Tea
* Assam Tea

Optional Extras:

* Digestives
* Chocolate Digestives
* Custard Creams
* Any biscuit to dunk

Rule of thumb for tea pot:

* Measure out how many cups you want to brew.
* Add that amount of boiling water to tea pot.
* Drop one tea bag per cup and one extra for the pot and stir.
* Brew for 2-3 minutes and stir occasionally.
* Serve however you want it.

It has a [giant duck](http://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DSUq59OrP49attchhD45kg/ls.jpg) as a tourist attractionnorly. It also has an awesome little river walkway lit up at night, and its really nice.

I found a really good place for food and sat outside watching the river and the sunset, just wish i coulda had a beer, alas for driving!

Also also I SAW A FRIKKIN GATOR. You could see the snout poking out of the water (its a full moon, so there's some light etc), and i saw it moving and then it ate something, i think a fish, and kept on drifting away. That was really cool.

tomorrow is my last working day here - i need to do laundry and pack up, and then saturday drive the hire car back to JFK, and get the train over to East Orange (american place names are ridiculous) where i have a hotel for 6 days :D

We were promised more from him and we're obviously never going to get anything special out of him. You can buy cheaper squad players if that's what your initial aim was.

He also wasn't bought to be a world-renowned midfielder.  We were in the process of rebuilding and he was a significant improvement over fucking Jay Spearing.  Ramires was bought for 22 million euros.  So I guess he wasn't thought of as a rotational squad player either.  But that's what he came to be. 

&gt; I meant anyone at his position. Rossiter is a young player who fits the bill just fine. Or any other midfielder who's better. Which is pretty much every single one on the team.

Jordan Rossiter has just turned 18.  No midfielder had earned minutes over Allen.  Luis Alberto plays further forward and didn't impress.  Suso wanted more regular time and moved on, but he also plays further forward.  And any other options like Joao Texeira have not displayed any sort of form that commands they get in ahead of Allen when Liverpool are trying to climb the table.  We haven't seen Allen play this season, so how is he ""taking minutes away from someone who could be better?  Your criticism of Allen is so fucking misguided it's hilarious.

And he was even considered the best player on the pitch when we lost to Hull 1-0 in spite of his efforts.

&gt; No one's knocking on our door for Allen, yet Lucas has many suitors because he's a special player at a difficult position.

Yes, Besiktas wanted to *rent* him and Inter has come for him in the past.  Wow, what an elite list.  He's a good player.  He's in no way ""special.""  He is fairly one dimensional and that stops him from reaching the next level in his role.  Players like Schneiderlin, Matic and Coquelin are ""special"" defensive mids as they can put in a tackle and consistently link defense to attack.  That fault in Lucas's game is why he isn't favored to start and why Allen is often preferred ahead of him when a defensive effort isn't valued.

But ones which have very different responsibilities.

The UK *requires* a separation of power, most importantly, a separation between the English State and the British State. It is not sustainable or nor is it wise for Westminster to continue to carry out both roles, it might be (or was) OK for English people for which the British State remains a simple unitary state with one Parliament, one leader, one Queen. But in the 15 years of devolution the situation within the devolved countries (i.e the non-English part of the UK) has become very different, with two major levels of power, and two leaders. Now is the time for Westminister itself to change. The UK is not England and England doesn't rule the UK, so a solution has to be found that is fair for every nation within it.

The plan I have proposed would, as far as an English person is concerned, reduce the amount of politicians considerably, all 117 non-English MPs would be removed, and within the new UK-wide senate, a small number: 20, 30, 50 etc would be elected across the UK. A smaller, leaner upper house which in change of a small number of very important issues. Westminister continues as it has always done, but without the responsibilities over non-English affairs. That moves to the new UK-wide ""senate"".

England: ~500 etc in the commons, 20-50 in the senate, maybe a few in the Lords if they want to keep that thing for English things - the Lords aren't used in the devolved parliaments anyway.

The difference would be even more stark in the other nations: the only political members being 20-50 members in the senate, and a few more members in their devolved parliaments to deal with the increased responsibilities (and in the case of Wales, a considerable amount is nessesary regardless as the Assembly has a tiny amount of members right now, 60 in total, far few for the responsibilities it currently holds let alone what it will hold in the future).

So let's say, Wales: 100 members in the Senedd (Welsh Assembly), 20-50 members in the UK-wide senate. The same situation in Scotland and Northern Ireland, that's it.

null,null,geetea,lfc68,,null,"&gt;He also wasn't bought to be a world-renowned midfielder.
Welsh Xavi was a real thing being touted at the time? 15 million pounds is nothing to scoff at, at the time. 

&gt; Ramires was bought for 22 million euros. So I guess he wasn't thought of as a rotational squad player either. 

Chelsea fans would have no problem getting rid of him from my understanding. 

&gt;No midfielder had earned minutes over Allen. 

If anything it just shows how razor thin we were at the CM position last year and somewhat this year if Lucas leaves. Buy someone better would be the point of it all. Allen is expendable and can easily be replaced. Hell, we got Milner for free. A few good performances from an extremely underachieving squad last year means jack shit to me. Role players in all sports eventually have a few breakout games but they remains role players because they can't achieve that consistently. Strive for better consistent players.

&gt;Yes, Besiktas wanted to rent him and Inter has come for him in the past. Wow, what an elite list.

Not to mention Napoli. Those are three teams more than Allen will ever receive without Liverpool trying to openly get rid of him. Higher quality as well. 

I never said he was world class at his position since there are truly few that are but he's definitely no slouch when fully healthy. Looking back last year, our best run of form was with him on the side. That was no coincidence. Here is a tweet demonstrating that https://twitter.com/squawka/status/553889503081820160. We later ended up winning after that against Sunderland so add another W with him. Guess who came in when Lucas wasn't playing? You guessed it, your boy Allen. Allen has never propped the team up to a better level consistently like Lucas has. If you're saying Allen is worth more to the team then you're pretty much delusional bordering on insane.

Experience means exactly what it says; that the player has accumulated a lot of time playing at the highest level and therefore can handle the pressure involved with playing at this level. Obviously a good reading of the game and good positioning are things that come with experience but they do not define what experience is itself. Milner is 29 and obviously has a lot more experience under his belt than Can. Can is still young and will get better with time but at the minute Milner is the better player.,null,0,null,1440730366,null,null,false,0,cui8dld,null,t3_3ikz2m,null,null,null,t1_cuhfhg2,null,null,null,1441541882,null,1,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

It's also getting a lot better very quickly so what our expectations are now of what the limits are will probably not be the same in 5-10 years.

What may well need to happen is a fundamental change in how capitalist society works to match the new reality.  The idea of getting a job to pay for your stuff may not work in the same way anymore as advanced automation technology will put the ability to create huge amounts of goods in the hands of very few people.  In theory it's a very exciting time as we may be at the earliest stages of a new type of industrial revolution.  What is worrying is that in the transfer to an industrialised society it took a long time and significant government legislation for the benefits to actually be passed on to the people at the bottom of the social order.

&gt;I love that you completely ignore evidence that just last season he was key to good Liverpool performances.

Like I said, last year was disappointing for the majority of the time, a lot of which Allen was a part of. Role players will have a good game now and then but will never make it a trend. Especially as a starter, which he was for many disappointing games.

&gt; All in all, the point is that in every sport role players are NEEDED. So trying to argue that we need to force out someone who is reliable just because he's not a star is fucking stupid. We can add more central midfielders, but we don't need to force out a squad player to do it.

We can't because no one will pay much for him. Also, why wouldn't you want to build someone else instead? Buy young prospects and let them be a rotation player as they grow (aka Allen's role). At this point Allen is a waste of space. He was brought in to be a big player and has never showed that he will be one. Move on to the next project already.

Employers will want evidence of your skills be it past work experience or qualifications. 

2. Don't lie to employers, they will want to know why you were out of work for a decade and will want to know what happened. Don't worry, they just want to check that you didn't spend 10 years in jail for stealing intellectual property or whacking a co-worker. If you ask kindly, your doctor should be able to write you a note confirming that you were too ill to work for a certain period. Show that you are a good character. Be prepared to explain any gaps in your work career. I should note that even with a criminal record, you can still get a job. You will have to work harder to convince the employer that you are not a risk.

3. No interviewer will snuff you if you are not wearing your finest Savile Row suit. Just turn up before the interview, with a copy of your CV as a reminder and any additional documentation. Cleanly shaven (go for no facial hair and short hair if you are not confident with a beard). Now it depends on the company and you'll have to judge it, but most interviewers are happy if you turn up in a grey/black Asda suit (that fits well) with a blue shirt. Some nice smart black shoes with laces never fails. A tie is optional (recommended), but keep it plain.   

5. It depends what level you will want to enter a corporation in. In this case, it seems best to me to emphasise your willingness to learn and develop new skills. This is a chance for prospective employers to mould an enthusiastic worker to help fix their problems and become their expert.  

6. For some ~~easy~~ money (Easy coding, passable design, tricky customers), you can always build basic websites for people.

6. Cont: Secondly (although a bit off-base for a programmer), I found tech-support and computer repair a reasonable side earner. Avoid students they will want to pay you sweet fuck all and avoid payment full stop unless it has their dissertation on it. I found elderly customers to be reliable, fair, and consistent when it comes to paying for jobs. As long as you make clear all the costs and sign a contract up front. 

Keep calm, and expect to be questioned on any information you give them.

* Where did your SQL experience come from?
* What was your most recent project, be it work or personal, and what skills did you use to complete it?
* How do you keep up to date with the latest technologies, and further your development/programming skills?
* What are your long terms goals?
* I see that you have a period out of work, and that you are now returning to work. That's great, is there anything we can do to facilitate that?

The interview is one of the hardest parts. Treat it like a test, revise well, keep calm, and you should pass it. You won't get a job most of the time though. I have sometimes said this at the end: 
&gt; ""Thank-you for this interview, could I possible ask two questions? (pause and wait). Thanks, firstly I would like to know if you have advice on how you got to where you are today (very useful information), and do you have any comments on how my application/interview could be improved.

We're not in a free market?

We're in a single market. Ideally we should be in either the common market which is one step lower or a free market which is complete withdrawal. The single market consists of a common market (no goods + services tariffs) + free movement + universal customs union. The single market, of which we are part, promotes protectionism in how it restricts external trade by removing internal tariffs. This largely disadvantages and depletes worldwide business and thus makes things more expensive and less profitable and both ends of the equation. It also hurts international relations considering how, for example, we're forbidden to retain a seat in the World Trade Organisation as an EU state. The idea of restricting outside markets via tariffs, promoting economic inequality, is what wholeheartedly prevents us from being a free market. 

An idea which I'd like to outline in regards to being in this single market is that we are obliged, by membership, to adopt the EUs Customs Union (EUCU). A problem arises in how this EUCU package applies to both our internal ""domestic"" and external ""foreign"" trade. It's, to stress, applied universally. So an institution **which states** provide ~45%ish of our trade and declining determine a set of bureaucratic rules ^big ^business ^friendly which are applied to a 100% of our economy. The EU has complete authority on British trade. I'm sure you'll understand why this is dangerous. EU policy transcend national accountability. I'll not bother going into EUconomics at the moment so I'll scorn that on a point of principle.

Now with a premise. I'll explain the option which I believe you'd like. This is under the assumption that you'd like to keep the perks of a common market (no goods + services' tariffs) and not that of free movement. This can be done through a membership called EFTA. It would be available for Britain post EU exit. EFTA essentially allows one to be out of the single market and in the common market. Tariffs would still remain low between Britain and EU states but, more importantly, we regain economic authority and political authority though that's a separate debate. EU customs, following a Brexit, only then apply to external trade between Britain, other EFTA members and previously fellow EU states. We can then trade on an international basis as an independent nation allowing us to develop policy and customs on mutual benefit and not EU blanket regulation. We can expand our economy beyond the corpse of the European Union.",null,0,null,1440735257,null,null,false,0,cuiaq9p,null,t3_3ilelx,null,null,null,t1_cuhr0f6,null,null,null,1441542991,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

No, your point was that Joe Allen needs to *not be on the team*

He could get in the way of someone younger trying to get minutes... if there was someone younger trying to get minutes that could actually outplay him.  There hasn't been.  So how is this a point you're sticking to?

&gt; Also, why wouldn't you want to build someone else instead? Buy young prospects and let them be a rotation player as they grow.

Probably because we have 2 senior midfielders ahead of Allen while we're trying to develop Can.  Lucas is on the same level with Allen and is only played situationally due to his defensive specialties.  We aren't looking to purely develop players.  That is what reserves and cup games are for.  So we're not going to be buying any ""projects"" at this point to develop within the squad.  If we brought in a midfielder, they'd be closer to a finished project.  Rossiter will be developed, but he won't be thrown in just so he can get minutes when Allen would be required to start due to Henderson/Can/Milner being unavailable.  That isn't how you ""develop"" players, even when you aren't competing for top 4, especially when they're kids.   If he's ready for a start and he has the quality to push ahead of Allen, sure.  But playing him just to get him experience starting in the premier league is unwise.

Didn't one of the promoted or mid-table sides have any need for him? Why was he getting chopped at half time when the whole side wasn't performing?

Yeah cause he sucks......

&gt; He could get in the way of someone younger trying to get minutes... if there was someone younger trying to get minutes that could actually outplay him. There hasn't been. So how is this a point you're sticking to?

I just said for this season. And for last season we should have signed someone else to begin with. It's why we've moved Can to the center, signed Milner, and most likely keeping Lucas. If there is no one better then SIGN someone. How many times do I have to repeat myself? Sign someone cause Allen will never cut it. 

&gt;Lucas is on the same level with Allen and is only played situationally due to his defensive specialties.

You're nutty. I brought out a form chart with and without Lucas already. Lucas changes the teams performance on a consistent basis. Allen does not. They are not equal and will never be equal in terms of their position. 

&gt; We aren't looking to purely develop players. That is what reserves and cup games are for. So we're not going to be buying any ""projects"" at this point to develop within the squad

Our whole transfer policy up until recently has been to buy young talent. Hell, it's why we bought Allen in the first place. The list starts with Borini, Allen, Alberto, Assaidi, Can, Mignolet, Llori, Markovic, etc.

&gt;If we brought in a midfielder, they'd be closer to a finished project.

Yes, like Milner. Which is good because we definitely needed an upgrade at the position with Allen getting so many minutes.

&gt; Rossiter will be developed, but he won't be thrown in just so he can get minutes when Allen would be required to start due to Henderson/Can/Milner being unavailable.

I never said throw in young players for the fuck of it. Obviously they have to be able to perform and Jordan is more than capable as example against Arsenal when Ibe was shitting his pants. He could probably fill in the role of Allen perfectly. A rotation player with POTENTIAL to actual be something special in the future. It's why teams like Barca get rid of these kinds of flops. They are impeding growth of others and they're also just not ever going to be starting 11 quality. Move onto the next project or sign someone better. Y

&gt; Allen was not ""brought in to be a big player"" and it's really hilarious that you suggest that.

He was brought in because it was thought by Rodgers that he had the potential to be a big player in his system. That's a fact. Why else would we fork up 15 million? If we wanted a squad player then we could have easily signed a veteran for cheap.

He rated Shelvey over Hendo. Now Ibe over Markovic. I'm not saying they're completely similar, but if we're being honest about who looks more dangerous, it's absolutely Markovic. He was never great. But the greatest thing you could say about Ibe is that he made a few solid runs in a few matches last season.

&gt;Asked by Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts

&gt;To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many National Insurance numbers were active on 31 December 2012.[HL1968]

&gt;The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord Freud): On 31 December 2012 there were approximately **65 million active National Insurance Numbers** (NINos) held on the DWP Customer Information System (CIS).


To that 65 million you'd have to add teenagers and children under 16 who haven't been issued one, which would be a lot (12 millionish?), and take off pensions still being paid to the dependants of dead people, which wouldn't be anywhere near so much. I'd imagine the supermarkets have a pretty good handle on how much their customers chuck in the bin. Supermarkets do take an inordinate and closely studied interest in their customers' habits.

I've read somewhere that the water companies also estimate a 70 million plus population based on water consumption and sewage stats but I can't remember where. 

Also

http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2007-05-09b.272.1

&gt;Lord Marlesford (Conservative) asked Her Majesty's Government:

&gt;What investigation is under way in the Department for Work and Pensions to establish how many of the **76,719,264** national insurance numbers currently held by the Department for Work and Pensions customer information system are in active use; what results the investigation has yielded so far; and whether a report will be made to Parliament.

EDIT: RE: Mark Karpeles.

When you're dealing in crypto, much like dealing in cash, the buck stops with you in terms of the responsibility with your funds, if you hand your funds over to an online wallet run by an ammature (or a proffessional for that matter) you are doing so at your own risk, it is up to you whether you decide to trust them or whether you trust yourself, or somebody else, more.

Legal oversight in the financial sector has made people a lot more ""safe"" in the sense that it sheilds them from personal responsibility, you don't have to worry too much about the reputation of the bank because at the end of the day you believe if the bank really fuck up, the Government will bail them out with money they take from *their* captive customers, the taxpayers.

That being said, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin use public key cryptography to do away with much of the trust you require in a financial institution. Not so much with an online wallet that loses or steals your bitcoin but, for example, with 2-of-3 multisig escrow. I mean immagine PayPal without the possibility that they could lose or steal the money they are holding in escrow for a trade between two untrusted parties, you still have to trust them, but instead of actually needing to trust them with your money you only have to trust that they will arbitrate any dispute fairly and direct the coin accordingly.

In short, instead of placing all of our trust in other people, institutions and regulators - in whose interest it is to become corrupt or suffocate their competition with additional regulatory overhead - we place as much of our trust as is possible in mathematics and a distributed consensus network, limiting it to only the point of trade or where that can't be achived adding other parties that we only trust as an arbitrators and not a transaction processors.

Blair took up where Thatcher left off.

She dismantled the working class by crushing the manufacturing sector and left the people demoralised and on the scrap heap, Blair gave them jobs in offices and retail and new hope.  In doing so the old working class began to see themselves as middle class (even if they aren't) and instantly subscribed to new labours centre right ethos. 

This new middle class have aspirations they could never have dreamed of 20 years ago, they are convinced that because they are a middle manager and their wife is a supervisor that they should easily be able to afford to eat out, buy coffee on the way to work,  2 new audis and 2 foreign holidays a year while raising 2 kids and the only reason they struggle to acheive this is because of immigrants and benefits claimants which they believe are bleeding them dry.

null,null,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt; It seems more likely to me like the suicidal person may decide to take someone with them when they shoot themselves (or the bullet could ricochet and hit someone else) than it is for paramedics in Japan

Well, in the US, gunshot suicides make up ~60% of all gunshot deaths. So less than one person is murdered for every person that commits suicide. Since some murder-suicides involve school/spree shootings which involve 10+ victims, this suggests the vast majority of suicides are committed by people who drive themselves to a secluded spot or settle themselves down on their bed or in the bathroom before they squeeze the trigger, very deliberately posing no risk to anyone else.

In terms of Detergent Suicides. Japanese Paramedics may be clued up, but family members or concerned neighbours might not be. Moreover, I would imagine that elsewhere in the world (such as the US), this is something paramedics don't come across very often, and as such it presents a serious potential risk. Equally if they're in an apartment block and the gas leaks into the ventilation or through the ceiling into the next apartment they could also start killing innocents.

The other thing to point out is it's not difficult to kill a lot of people. A friend was dong a Chemistry PhD. He had [Phosgene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosgene) in his Lab fridge (it's a useful industrial reagent as well as being a scheduled chemical weapon). If he'd been feeling suicidal, it wouldn't have been difficult to walk into a shopping centre and spill a vial of the stuff in a crowded shop and poison dozens of people.

I think it's better not to get obsessed with bias. You have people who do this bizarre thing of just sourcing everything ""*I watch BBC AND RT so I get a balanced view*"" as if you'll automatically get a balanced picture if you read two sides of the story. This is a [logical fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_to_moderation).

Instead look for sources with journalistic integrity and use your own judgement as to what is fact and what is interpretation. A good source will, dispite their bias, still give you a balanced factual picture and make it clear what is true and what is their own spin on it.

For that I would recommend The Economist and The Financial Times. The Economist has an admitted pro-market and classic liberal bias but their reporting will make it clear what is the latter. They also tend to have two stories for their main topic of the week. A factual account and then an editorial argument as to what should be done about it.

&gt;  buy services, not assets (which can be a very good thing)

why do you say a good thing?  we are talking about large construction projects mainly - ie fixed assets

&gt; •amortise the lifecycle cost neatly

why is this a good thing? we are talking about a government that can literally print money if it wants too, and can borrow at much lower % than anyone else, not a business that needs to balance the books...

&gt; •risk transfer valuation, if you do it right (if you do it wrong, don't blame the private sector)

When you look at the huge costs of PFI is the extra expense really worth that supposed risk aversion.  I get point that gov needs to do better with large projects, but let's fix that with transparency and better RACI's etc...

&gt; •speed to market

How is this?  I hear this a lot but don't understand... how/why is PFI faster than just setting up a gov bond and start building?

And they forget we did try, signings like Lamela and Soldado were highly praised, Paulinho was coming off the back of a great tournament, and some were even tipping us as dark horses for the league. It didn't work, that's football and that will always happen. They have very short memories.

Everything has shifted at Spurs now, we now have a philosophy right down to the youth, running through the club in its entirety. We are investing in youth and our very own graduates in an attempt to stabilise us and lead us into the new stadium as these players grow and mature. I think that is very commendable and more than anything, sensible for a club like ourselves.

The reality is we are right where we should be, a top 5-6 club that at times will unearth a gem and challenge the top four. Jamie forgets the likes of Bale, Carrick and Modric were no where near a finished article when we bought them. It's not like we brought in world class talent, it just developed that way. For every Bale there is a Bostock. While I agree with some of his points on pre season, and yes we should have addressed the striker situation earlier, the rest of this I cannot agree with.

Poch's recent comments on waiting for the right striker sit well with me, we honestly can't do worse than Soldado if we use Chadli or Clinton up front if needed. There is no point wasting money on another misfit to our team and style.

Every manager in the world has favorites it's what they are paid to do, how else can they manage a squad

Regardless you're still talking nonesense about favouritism. Saying Rodgers is only loaning out Markovic because he isnt his 'favourite' whereas Allen and Lallana are. So...? I don't want Markovic to be loaned out but if Rodgers doesn't want Markovic in his squad then of course loan him out, no point keeping him.

At the 2010 election over 60% voted for left of center parties. And in 2015 about the same number voted left of center. But a larger number considered labour a non option. 

More and more of the voting pop are peaple that grew up in the 90s. People that are paying for the short term prosperity of tory sell the asset finacial management.

If you issue loads of bonds in a short time, you'll find that at the auction you're offered much less than par value, so the effective rate (besides coupon payments) will be surprisingly high.

Amortising costs neatly is generally a good thing. People, and governments, generally prefer to pay for things ""as they go"" rather than a massive up-front out of pocket cost.

Risk transfer is also a good thing to an extent, but this is where a lot of PFI in the UK has fallen down. Attempting to buy something as a risk-free buyer will lead the vendor to stick to safe, non-innovative ways of delivery, and will put a huge risk premium on the project. They'd be mad not to. There needs to be a stronger element of risk sharing between the buyer and seller for a project to succeed.

That's all I'm saying ... PFI is not inherently bad. It has been around for a lot longer than the 1990s, though people don't realise that - it goes back to middle ages - and things that stick around that long have some value.

Personally, I'd pay off any and all finance deals before embarking on a new venture. Riding a bike is fucking *addictive* - you'll never control any vehicle the same after a few months on a motorbike. It permanently changes your perspective on road use, machine control and safety. It's something that I recommend wholeheartedly to everyone - even if you don't go on to get your full license, it's a brilliant way to make you a much better road user.

And because of all those massive draws to it, you can end up spending a *lot* on it! Bikes themselves aren't bad, you can get a pretty reliable steed for a reasonable price, but it's all the gear, accessories, tools and trinkets you acquire which really sap at your funds.. You can budget for a £1,500 payout for a bike, but two months down the line when you find you need a decent tension wrench and socket kit? That's £85 right there you never knew you needed to spend!

I think to get the most out of a bike you've got to get your hands dirty, get some decent tools and service the machine yourself and service it often. That means a pretty regular expense for changing pads, tyres, fluids, filters... It adds up! Furthermore, like any vehicle it can suddenly require a part without any prior notice. My bike just had a new £183 part replaced, because some inconsiderate bozo decided to leave a nail on the road. But that's £183 I paid out of pocket and if I was paying a finance deal at the same time, I'd probably have had to take finance out for that £183 too...

So yeah. imho, pay off anything and then embark. That said there is no requirement to go all in on day one - you can do your CBT, get a 125 with some relatively budget gear and have change out of £2k. You're up and going then and you can decide if you want to sink a few more grand in for training, a bigger bike and better kit or just tootle around on a 125cc until your car finance is up.",null,0,null,1440751775,null,null,false,0,cuifw4s,null,t3_3ipdyn,null,null,null,t3_3ipdyn,null,null,null,1441545488,null,4,null,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,4,null

We use one joint account which takes all our income and pays our bills. We use YNAB software to keep on top of spending and set budgets. It's a nice way of agreeing how much to spend on everything from essentials to luxuries, to agreeing savings goals, etc. If there's no budget for it then it doesn't get bought!

I'm the 'accountant'. My wife is the 'creative' half, I'm the half that is better at dealing with money. So I do all the legwork, propose budgets, keep track of spending, arrange loans, propose longer term goals (e.g. what to invest in, when to pay off debt, etc). BUT, I make sure I've taken her though it all and got her agreement. That applies to long term planning and short term budgeting. 

When first setting up YNAB we had end of month budget reviews (as pay day came around) to review each budget category and set spend for the next month. Now, we don't need to so much as we have built and refined a budget that works and stays generally consistent so it flows from month to month. Yearly expenditure (e.g. car insurance) is saved up for in advance, a bit each month, so we don't have to scrabble around to find cash for big items like we used to when much younger. When the bill comes in, the allocated money is already there waiting to pay it.

&gt;Another way of putting it is that all of the £65m we received from the Luis Suarez sale last summer was painfully wasted.

Whether we loan him or not, if he doesn't play regular first team football for us (which is why we're loaning him in the first place) this remains true. 

&gt;We’ve got four competitions to crack this term and by sending the winger out on loan our squad becomes immediately weaker.

If he would have made a positive contribution, sure, but we don't know that. He hasn't looked very convincing if we are dead honest with ourselves. He's talented but somehow struggles to grab hold of games. 

We do also have quite a few talented young players we can (and will) put in if needed. So it's not like Rodgers has nothing to choose from.

&gt;The Europa League draw is made today and represents a competition that would have been absolutely perfect for Markovic to start every game of.

Again, assuming he takes that chance and does well. Which is not guaranteed. 

&gt;Without Markovic, Brendan Rodgers might have to pick his ‘Premier League’ players in Europe and the League Cup. 

We are kidding ourselves if we believe Rodgers won't pick strong teams in the cups and Europa League. He always has and probably always will. 

Aaand I can't be bothered to read more.

Why is every decision the club makes being met with such fury these days? If we held onto Balotelli and Markovic, gave them chances and they failed to make a difference Rodgers would be blasted for ""failing to notice the obvious"" or ""not learning from the past"" or whatever.

The one thing that is very clear about this transfer window is we're developing a strong squad mentality. Everyone who doesn't fit is being moved out - either permanently, on loan, or to solo training. 

Milner, Ings, Firmino, and Benteke are known for their graft. Clyne and Gomez have shown that they have it too. 

Markovic does not look like he has the fire in his belly that we're looking for. It's not necessarily his fault, it's just who he is. We clearly have some desire to hang on to him as there's supposedly no buyout clause, but I'm not holding my breath.

You are faulting Rodgers on Borini and Allen two of his signings he made when he first came in.  It is very common for managers to bring players over when they first arrive.  Allen is a great bench player which he is content to be.  Also Rodgers doesn't play him over anyone unfairly.  

Lack of awareness about who will and who won't break out?  Joe Gomez is playing like one of the best left backs in the league.  Ibe came in at the end of last season and lifted the side.  Flanagan was in the starting XI of the second place run squad.  Sterling, Can... he played Rossiter at the Emirates last week a player .  All these players were included at the right time. 

He rated Shelvey over Henderson.  Of course he did.  Jonjo is a good midfielder.  Everyone could see the talent, his problem was consistency.  He told him to go to Swansea and it has been great for his career.  Shelvey is playing excellent football right now.  (Side not I'm really looking forward to him versus the United midfield.) 

Ibe over Markovic, after writing a few sentences I agree with you a little bit.  But I think the heart gets into this, I feel like we need Markovic to play better because that transfer window is looking more and more like a disaster.  But I would have liked to have seen him in this side.  

Those three were cheaper than one Markovic in more ways than one.  We all watched YouTube highlights of him, listened to people who saw him play.  A top European talent is something we all heard.    I still think Ilori may have a chance, CB is the most stacked position right now, especially now with Gomez probably fifth choice CB.

The team is also a full squad more so than any other in recent memory.  The bench is looking good, with pretty well established starters.  So a loan may not be the prelude to an ended career, it may just be a symptom of having a surplus of talent.

As an example, Nick Clegg was made by his party to campaign for the abolition of tuition fees, a policy in which he didn't really believe (this is, I feel, problematic in itself). He, the rest of the Lib Dem ministers and most of their MPs, then voted in favour of the £9,000 fees, because there was no way for the members to stop them from doing so.

The obvious response would be to say, 'Yes, but those MPs who did that kind of thing would be deselected by their local parties' -- yet this did not happen to a single MP who voted in favour of the fees. This is probably because, if MPs are deselected, this puts the seat at greater risk of falling to another party: Most MPs enjoy an 'incumbency bonus' which vanishes if they are deselected and replaced. Party members know this and so are reluctant to actually hold their MPs to account in this way.

Furthermore, even if those Lib Dem MPs who voted for tuition fees had been deselected, the fees would've remained in place. You coud argue that the constant threat of deselection might make them less likely to go against members' wishes but, as I've argued above, that tends not to work out in practice.

By the way, if anyone has any stats on how Labour MPs behaved in the period when we had automatic trigger ballots, I'd be interested in seeing them.",null,0,null,1440752034,null,null,false,0,cuifybs,null,t3_3ip8lr,null,null,null,t3_3ip8lr,null,null,null,1441545518,null,4,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,4,null

null,null,Chazmer87,cnty-scotland,Scotland,null,"&gt;However, widely differing legal systems, offence definitions, terminological variations, recording practices and statistical conventions makes any cross-national comparison on rape statistics difficult, which is why the UNODC itself caution against using their figures. It should also be noted that many countries do not report any rape statistics at all to the UNODC, and some report very low numbers, despite studies that indicate otherwise.

&gt;The Swedish police record each instance of sexual violence in every case separately, leading to an inflated number of cases compared to other countries. Sweden also has a comparatively wide definition of rape. This means that more sexual crimes are registered as rape than in most other countries. For example, in 2005 Sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider, which led to a marked increase in reports. Additionally, the Swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases, in an effort to decrease the number of unreported cases. For this reason, large-scale victimisation surveys have been presented by criminologists as a more reliable indicator of rape prevalence. An EU-wide survey on sexual violence against women, published the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) in 2014, placed Sweden below Denmark and Finland, and a previous assessment by Brå have placed Sweden at an average level among European nations.

&gt;According to the FRA study there's a strong correlation between higher levels of gender equality and disclosure of sexual violence. This, and a greater willingness among Swedish women to report rape in relationships, may also explain the relatively high rates of reported rape in Sweden, which has a long-standing tradition of gender equality policy and legislation, as well as an established women's movement, and has been ranked as the number one country in sex equality.

TLDR:  When you count things in a different way you get a different count.  Sweden's rape crime is less than it's scandanavian neigbours ",null,0,null,1440752042,null,null,false,0,cuifydu,null,t3_3imciw,null,null,null,t1_cuiel9t,null,null,null,1441545518,null,7,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

First you'll need to go to a supermarket, preferably high quality. There are 2 extremely important things you will need to buy. The first one is a box of teabags,  it varies by person but PG Tips is a popular choice. You will then need to go to the British section of the store, not all stores have this but the high quality ones are more likely. You're looking for Jaffa Cakes, it may also be branded as the nectar of the gods. Go back to your house / flat / cave and boil some water. Fill the cup / mug up to about 3 quarters full and then place the teabag in the cup for precisely 2 minutes. Then, carefully remove the teabag and place in a splash of milk.


You will then need to locate your nearest 'British Pub', I've been told they are pretty popular. British people are known for eating our own kind of food when we are away so that is probably your best chance of finding us. Place the cup of tea (make sure it's still hot, don't for the love of god re-heat it) and Jaffa cakes outside the entrance to the 'pub'. Next, take out a large net (I didn't tell you to buy this as all Americans seem to kill and trap animals so I presumed you already had one) and wait outside the door.

Any real British person should immediately be attracted but the tea and Jaffas and have no choice but to scoff the lot. Before the bloke finishes off the Jaffas, trap him in the net. 

I'll leave the rest up to you, God speed.

&gt;The police have stated Sinn Fein are committed to peace, and that the PIRA are not involved in any criminal activity as an organisation. 

They said they didn't know whether the IRA gave the go ahead yet, so that conclusion was just politics, but that what they did know was that PIRA men carried out murder.

When their thugs last did this without go ahead from above they got notionally kicked out. Conspicuously nothing like this has emerged yet.

Yes, the mortality rate is higher than that for the general population but would you not expect that of a population group who are all suffering from disabilities?

How does that compare to the mortality rate of this demographic before they were assessed? How does it compare to people with disability who are already in work? Or to those judged unfit for work? Without more info we don't even know how these people died. Would we blame the fit for work assessments if all these people had died in car accidents or of natural causes?

I guess (hope) a lot of money will have disappeared into unexciting things like that setting us up as a premier league side financially.

Plus there are the various loans and debts that need to be paid off, building the new training centre cost a fair amount.

To be honest though it is a bit concerning how little we seem to spend. Part of me thinks after the success of last season the board might think building a good team in the league is easier than it actually is.

But as others have said spending lots of money doesn't always make a good team.

and here's the thing: we haven't argued about money in a long time (plenty of arguments about other stuff!). it took time getting to this position of mutual trust, but once you're there it's amazing.

there are two massive problems i have with the separate money route: 

1. you need to know the family's financial position in order to make decisions. it's ok if you are open about what you are doing, but if you don't know whether your partner is saving/spending, you can't make good decisions on what you save/spend.  you can overcome this with good communication, but then why keep it separate.

2. sooner or later, something will happen in your lives that will fuck up the status quo. maybe it's 12 months of maternity leave at statutory, or a job loss, or moving to part-time etc.  but when it almost inevitably happens, your money situation will get put right out of whack. the new mum needs a new pair of shoes, but has no income now, does her husband give her an allowance? please. all of the above situations are naturally stressful and adding to it with financial stress is a terrible idea...",null,0,null,1440753394,null,null,false,0,cuig9op,null,t3_3ipca0,null,null,null,t3_3ipca0,null,null,null,1441545666,null,5,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,5,null

I was thinking this would be a crazy, high scoring fixture, but now I don't know. Jota and Gray are big losses and I haven't seen what Brentford are like without them (and Pritchard and Odubajo). As it stands I think our right flank is the weak spot. Who are you playing as a left winger? Judge?

Otherwise we are scoring a lot at the moment. We've picked up two players who look fantastic - Chery and Luongo. Austin and Phillips are still here which obviously stax up the firepower a bit higher, and by the time this fixture rolls around Leroy Fer might be back in the mix. A trio of Fer flanked by Chery and Phillips is actually pretty scary on paper.

At the other end we've been a bit chaotic and we're leaking two goals a game and have just signed Huddersfield's keeper in anticipation of a possible Rob Green departure. So, however many you put past them last season might be a realistic expectation again against us.

1: Just lie to them and do it.  

2: You don't have to tell them although you can mention it if you like. Just be careful a stigma does exist. If you told me I wouldn't mark you down as long as it's not an serious active problem. So attending therapy once a month would be fine but a strong possibility of relapse with months off. 
 
3: Get yourself a good portfolio. Look at some freelance websites. Make something interesting for fun. A portfolio will help me see what you're good at. If it's got stuff related to what you would be doing great but if it's got something cool and super awesome which shows off the far end of your skills then it's even better. I have hired a woman to program lab machine firmware because she wrote a fps set in a maze made out of fractals textured walls. It demonstrated she knew enough to get the job done and left quite the impression. 

4: Your strongest is SQL. I'm already in love. But learn the extra for T-SQL I can not stress it enough T-SQL! it's hard to find people who have it. C# is also in big demand right now so that will serve you. While your doing Java (you have my sympathies) get some Javascript in there.  After that it's mostly php or python. You don't really need php to much but python can be picked up quickly especially for a experienced programmer. 

5: Freelancing online is an option but don't expect to make to much money. Sadly you have to compete with people in eastern Europe (especially Romania)  and the Asia who will do your job for 30p an hour. It's become quite a hardscene to get into because of it. But once you build clients you can make a bit extra. Freelancing is better at building a portfolio.

6: Porn. Seriously forums are big right now. Easy to operate and can make a profit after a couple of months. Although the subject of programming has a lot of forums due to it's target audience all being programmers. If you are capable of making educational video's on programming this can be a source of income. Even if the video already exists it can still make a profit. As a guy I work with recently put up batch and html tutorials and managed to make enough money to buy everybody a round.

7: Don't give up. It's a hard scene right now but not impossible just stay focused and stay active. Goto 1.

However, you also just need to get away from the idea that you can be a mushroom coder. There are very few such jobs around and you'd certainly have your CV binned at most employers if you expressed that attitude.

2. No.

3. Some: http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/benefits-and-help-when-looking-for-work. It's likely not going to be much though if they accept your request. You should have an ask around the family to see if someone might lend you a suit. Other than that, check out charity shops and sales. Don't buy something ridiculously out of date, something that doesn't fit at all or something horrendously cheap and shiny just because you feel you need a suit. Ultimately, decent smart-casual trousers, shirt and shoes will be fine for most interviews if your attitude is good.

4. Look at the jobs going in the area you want to live and for companies you'd like to work for and see what they look for. There's no point superficially ""brushing up"" on techs that may be completely useless to you.

5. Yes, but it's not easy to get an established income, particularly at a UK level.

6. No idea. You seem to want a unicorn. A job that is easy to get for someone with no portfolio but that can be dropped on a whim with no repercussions. The best you'll do is micro contracts on elance or whatever and you're back to the issue of no portfolio and competing against teenagers living in the Philippines.",null,0,null,1440754125,null,null,false,0,cuigfpx,null,t3_3in7jj,null,null,null,t3_3in7jj,null,null,null,1441545745,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I was stopped at red lights on a busy road, it was a 2-lane road and I was in the right hand lane when he says, ""you can be in either lane you know"". It's not as if I could move right at that moment but he made me paranoid about being in the right hand lane (even though it was perfectly fine), so as the lights turned green and we moved off, I came back into the left hand lane and he told me to watch out for some other car, which I was doing already and it was all fine. I made eye contact with the driver and he let me in. But because this guy felt the need to get involved, apparently that's enough to fail me.

The 2nd test was completely my fault and I'm more angry at myself because it was such a tiny thing but 1 major fault is enough to fail.

That's not a big issuance really. 2009 was obviously a bad time to sell debt, but perhaps you might have thought that a flight to safe assets (such as Gilts) would have stoked interest. It didn't.

It happened in 2002 as well. It'll happen again. I think in 2009 around 10% lower than the par value was bid, and that's a big gulf.

Amortising the value - yes, but you pay a consistent price against that asset each year. A bit like a fixed price mortgage. That, to many, is a big benefit.

Any example I pull out of PFI done well (e.g. DLR in London) can be undone with hindsight. It was a good deal at the time.

- The way to solve these is not to turn them into murders by introducing guns into the equation. Escalating situations and making them more dangerous does not stop them occurring, it just makes the more likely to end in death.

- If it becomes legal for me to get a gun for 'self-defence' it will also be considerably more likely that my attacker has a gun.

- Most victims of rape are raped by family members, friends or partners.You think future victims are just gonna pull out a gun and murder someone they care about at point-blank range once they realise what's happening?

- And by the time people know for certain they're about be raped the attacker is basically already on top of them. It's not like rapists announce their intentions 30 ft away and give you time to draw a gun. By that point, you probably can't reach your gun any more, and why risk having the gun taken away and used on you? Again, escalation makes your own death more likely.

- Same for robberies - by the time I know I'm being robbed, they're already on top of me. I either can't reach my gun or I'm risking having it taken away and used by someone else if I draw it. If they want my phone, wallet jewellery, let them have it. It's not worth my life or my attacker's.

- How many times have people shot family members in the night because they thought it was a home invasion? Unnecessary increased risk to both myself and my loved ones, in exchange for an *outside possibility* that I *may* thwart a crime that is unlikely to ever happen to me anyway? No thanks.

- By your argument, the saturation of guns in the US should have lead to there being no rapes, robberies, or home invasions there by now, but that's clearly not the case.

&gt;The Maltese navy eventually rescued the ship, only for another shock to greet Mr Tekle after he lodged an asylum bid in Malta. The Eritrean government had learned he and his friends were there, and pressured the Maltese to send them back, saying that as the war was over, they had nothing to fear.

&gt;“Somehow the Maltese believed them, and we ended up being handcuffed and flown back there. They took us into a warehouse full of soldiers all carrying Kalashnikovs. I was terrified.”

&gt;His fears were justified. He says he spent the next 18 months in prison, being beaten on a daily basis. Two of his friends were killed, and others went mad due to the heat and disease. “I got malaria and all they would give you was paracetomol,” he said. “It was a way of killing us over a long time - if you spent three or four years there you were finished.”

&gt;Eventually Mr Tekle escaped again, taking advantage of a party held by his captors to Eritrea’s independence day. This time he went straight to a UN refugee centre in Sudan, and was resettled in Britain in 2005 under an asylum program. Since then he has made strenuous efforts to integrate, learning fluent English, holding down a job in construction, and watching the news each night to learn more about his adopted homeland.

&gt;[...]“If you ask me where hell is on earth, I would probably say two places: Eritrea and North Korea,” added Mr Tekle. “There is no food, no electricity, and your friends can be killed in front of you. No wonder everyone is leaving - there is no hope.”

Nigeria:

&gt;As international support builds for the search for more than 200 abducted Nigerian schoolgirls, the United Nations refugee agency expressed alarm Friday at the swelling tide of people fleeing their homes in northeast Nigeria to escape attacks by Boko Haram insurgents that it said were unprecedented in their brutality and frequency.

&gt;Up to a thousand people are crossing the border into southern Niger every week from fear of attacks by the Islamist insurgent group and counterattacks by the Nigerian armed forces, and smaller numbers have arrived in Cameroon and Chad, Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for the refugee agency, told reporters.

&gt;Refugees are providing accounts of grenade attacks on markets killing villagers and livestock, summary executions and whole villages and their crops being burned to the ground.

&gt;“Some have witnessed friends or family members being randomly singled out and killed in streets,” Mr. Edwards said, while others had spoken of arbitrary arrests on suspicion of belonging to insurgent groups.

I don't think people from Pakistan would qualify for refugee status, but then this is actually all fairly irrelevant. Most people aren't coming from these countries, I just wanted to point out that those coming from some of the countries you gave as examples would probably be considered refugees.

&gt;""The pace of arrivals has been steadily increasing in recent weeks,"" Spindler told reporters, adding that: ""the vast majority of last week's arrivals were Syrians (16,997 people or 82% of the total), Afghans (2,847 or 14%) and Iraqis (582 or 3%), confirming that the overwhelming majority of arrivals are likely to qualify for refugee status.""

- If change, tell them that you will be monitoring them until the end of probation on these issues, and any slip back will mean they don't pass.

If you still have any concern at all at the end of probation, then extend it - give them another three months, and be clear why you are doing this.  If you don't have formal probation process, then do this with an aim to sacking them at the end of six months.

And I can't say this enough - document and evidence!  After every meeting on this, send an email outlining what was discussed and what the expected actions are and require them to reply agreeing that this is an accurate reflection.

You'd be surprised. Some do rely on the mere threat of violence to be enough to get you to comply, but won't follow through if called on it. After all, most people - even most criminals - don't want to be murderers, and don't want to risk their own safety by initiating violence. 

I still *wouldn't* tell a mugger 'no' if they've got me at knifepoint, because I have no way of knowing if it's a bluff and would rather not find out. But this idea that every mugger &amp; robber is a hardened criminal who will kill you the second you stop complying is a bit much, don't you think? A minority of them are, sure, but those ones are hardly going to announce their intention from a distance so you have time to respond &amp; draw your own weapon. They'll just jump you, and then it's too late for you to do anything but minimise your chance of dying. 

In every scenario, your best chance of surviving with minimal injury is to do everything you can to de-escalate the situation. Escalating it makes it more likely that you die. Just look at George Zimmerman &amp; Trayvon Martin - the situation could have been a complete non-event, but instead they both kept escalating things until one ended up dead. Completely avoidable. (I'm not saying they're equally responsible, but they both could have done things differently &amp; ultimately avoided Trayvon's death).

1. A fully fit Sturridge is arguably the second best striker in the BPL and I'm sure Rodgers will at least try to form some form of partnership between him and Benteke. I think consensus is that this will most likely be in the form of a diamond, however only Rodgers knows what he plans to do so we'll have to wait and see.

2. As others have noted, all clubs make shitty transfers. In the last two summers, our transfers have been mocked because ultimately they were under the shadow of Suarez; we had a massive influx of money and no player stood up to the impact that Suarez had, understandably. We have, however, made some very good transfers amongst the bad. Coutinho, Sturridge, Suarez turned out to be a bargain, and it's looking as though Milner, Gomez and Clyne will all be decent business. 

3. Liverpool absolutely have a chance to make top 4, however less likely than some other clubs. Manchester City are looking alot better than predicted, Arsenal have a good squad, and I fully expect Chelsea to be up there competing despite a slow start. Man Utd are the ones I think we could potentially leapfrog, however as always with the Prem it will be hard fought and we need to make sure we consistently beat lesser teams instead of taking draws and leaking losses.

4. I'm unsure, Europe typically is hard to predict. It depends on how much priority Rodgers views it with, and due to travel and slightly different squads results can be surprising. We have the capability of winning it, however with a very loose guess I could realistically see us going out in the knockout stages.

Let's have a quick review:

# [Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment)

For forty years between 1932 and 1972, the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) conducted an experiment on 399 black men in the late stages of syphilis. These men, for the most part illiterate sharecroppers from one of the poorest counties in Alabama, were never told what disease they were suffering from or of its seriousness. Informed that they were being treated for “bad blood,” their doctors had no intention of curing them of syphilis at all. 

The data for the experiment was to be collected from autopsies of the men, and they were thus deliberately left to degenerate under the ravages of tertiary syphilis—which can include tumors, heart disease, paralysis, blindness, insanity, and death. 

**TL;DR** *Government agency lies to civilians, deliberately allowing them to die in order to study them.* 

# [Gulf of Tonkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident)

North Vietnamese torpedo boats supposedly attacked the USS Maddox in the Gulf of Tonkin, off Vietnam, in a pair of assaults in 1964. It was the basis for the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, which committed major American forces to the war in Vietnam.

The alleged attack was little more than a transparent pretext for war, delivered in a one-two punch. First, media descriptions of the August 2nd attack as an ""unprovoked attack"" against a U.S. destroyer on ""routine patrol"" hid the fact that the Maddox was providing support for South Vietnamese military operations against the North. Second, the alleged August 4th attack appears to be a fabrication, official accounts attributing the ""error"" to confusion.

**TL;DR** *Government agency fabricates an atrocity in order to convince the country to go to war.*

# [MKULTRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra)

From 1953 to 1964 the CIA conducted dozens of experiments on the effects of biological and chemical agents on American citizens without their knowledge in Project MKUltra. These covert tests included subjecting the unwitting subjects to hallucinogenic drugs and other chemicals, among other things. 

The MKULTRA project dosed thousands of suspecting and unsuspecting people, including foreign nationals, with drugs in an effort to find either an interrogation or mind control weapon.

Experimental subjects were subjected in various sub-projects to experiments involving sensory deprivation, sexual abuse (including rape), verbal abuse, and other forms of psychological manipulation.

**TL;DR** *Government agency secretly drugs, rapes, and abuses thousands of people in order to develop mind-control.*


# [COINTELPRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO)

COINTELPRO was the FBI's secret program to undermine the popular upsurge which swept the country during the 1960s. Though the name stands for ""Counterintelligence Program,"" the targets were not enemy spies. The FBI set out to eliminate ""radical"" political opposition inside the US. 

When traditional modes of repression (exposure, blatant harassment, and prosecution for political crimes) failed to counter the growing insurgency, and even helped to fuel it, the Bureau took the law into its own hands and secretly used fraud and force to sabotage constitutionally protected political activity. Its methods ranged far beyond surveillance, and amounted to a domestic version of the covert action for which the CIA has become infamous throughout the world.

**TL;DR** *Government agency secretly infiltrates political organisations in order to sabotage and discredit them.*

# [Hillsborough Disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster)

In 1989, 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death and hundreds more were injured when trying to watch an FA Cup semi-final at the Hillsborough stadium. 

Police penned in fans, despite them being crushed, and deliberately removed themselves from rescue attempts, leaving it to the people to save themselves. 

Police prevented 43 of 44 ambulances from entering the stadium, and forcibly turned back anyone who tried to reach them. Only 14 of the 96 fatally injured arrived at hospital.

The police leaked fabricated stories to the press in order to paint the fans as being at fault. This lead to articles stating ""drunken Liverpool fans viciously attacked rescue workers as they tried to revive victims"" and ""police officers, firemen and ambulance crew were punched, kicked and urinated upon"". One claimed a dead girl had been ""abused"", and that Liverpool fans were ""openly urinating on us and the bodies of the dead"". These allegations contradicted the behaviour of many Liverpool fans, who gave first aid and helped security personnel stretcher away a large number of victims.

By 2012, an inquiry had shown how police had made ""strenuous attempts"" to blame the tragedy on the victims of the crush, including the alteration by police of 116 statements. It also concluded that up to 41 of the 96 fatalities might have been avoided had they received prompt medical treatment.

**TL;DR** *Police force causes the deaths of 96 people and tries to cover it up by blaming the people, falsifying statements and fabricating events.*

# [Operation Paperclip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip)

Operation Paperclip was the codename under which the US intelligence and military services extricated scientists from Germany, during and after World War II.

These scientists were secretly brought to the United States, without State Department review and approval; their service for Hitler's Third Reich, NSDAP and SS memberships as well as the classification of many as war criminals or security threats also disqualified them from officially obtaining visas. 

The majority of the scientists were deployed at White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico, Fort Bliss, Texas and Huntsville, Alabama to work on guided missile and ballistic missile technology. 

**TL;DR** *Government agency secretly smuggles hundreds of war criminals into the country in order to develop weapons of mass destruction.*

# [Nayirah Testimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_%28testimony%29)

Nayirah was a young Kuwaiti woman who, in the run up to the 1990-91 Gulf war, gave fraudulent testimony to a non-governmental Congressional Human Rights Caucus on October 10, 1990. She was presented as a 15 year old volunteer nursing assistant who needed to hide her identity for security reasons.

Nayirah stated that she had witnessed Iraqi soldiers take babies out of incubators, take the incubators, and leave the babies to die. Her testimony was regarded as credible and was widely publicized. It was cited numerous times by United States senators and the president in their rationale to back Kuwait in the Gulf War and it had a massive impact on both US and Western public opinion about the impending war.

Following the war, human rights investigators attempted to confirm Nayirah's story and could find no witnesses or other evidence to support it. It was later discovered that she was the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador. It was revealed that her testimony was organized as part of the Citizens for a Free Kuwait public relations campaign for the Kuwaiti government. 

**TL;DR** *Government agency fabricates an atrocity in order to convince the country to go to war.*

# [Operation Northwoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods__)

In 1962 the Joint Chiefs of Staff drew up and approved plans proposing launching a secret and bloody war of terrorism against their own country in order to trick the American public into supporting an ill-conceived war they intended to launch against Cuba.

Code named Operation Northwoods, the plan, which had the written approval of the Chairman and every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for innocent people to be shot on American streets; for boats carrying refugees fleeing Cuba to be sunk on the high seas; for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched in Washington, D.C., Miami, and elsewhere. People would be framed for bombings they did not commit; planes would be hijacked. Using phony evidence, all of it would be blamed on Castro, creating the excuse, as well as the public and international backing, needed to launch a war with Cuba.

**TL;DR** *Government agency plans terrorist attacks against their own people in order to convince the country to go to war.*

# [Operation Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird)

Operation Mockingbird was a secret campaign by the CIA to influence media. Begun in the 1950s, the organization recruited leading American journalists into a network to help present the CIA’s views, and funded some student and cultural organizations, and magazines as fronts. As it developed, it also worked to influence foreign media and political campaigns, in addition to activities by other operating units of the CIA.

**TL;DR** *Government agency infiltrates the ‘free press’ in order to push specific stories to the world.*

All of the above sound 'wildly unlikely' but a lot of them sound unnervingly familiar. 

This list isn't exhaustive, there are hundreds of proven conspiracies out there. So don't be so quick to dismiss people as cranks when they say ""the government has committed a false-flag terrorist atrocity in order to convince the country to go to war"" because it has happened several times in the past. It's the so-called 'cranks' that pursue and uncover the truth.

It's glaringly obvious this wasn't possible as we had no money to spend until the new TV revenue fell in to our account.

In regards to specifics:

A replacement keeper or somebody capable of realistically taking over from Howard in years time.

A central defender who can push Jagielka and Stones. I understand Funes Mori is now set to sign but please see the above passage.

A #10 is desperately needed. I understand Ross Barkley may be the man for this role in 5 years time but he could really do with someone to learn from in the meantime. He is currently learning how to play this role through the wisdom of his manager (a defensive midfielder in his playing days) and videos on YouTube.

A striker to push Lukaku. If Rom suffers a long-term injury the only replacement we have is a 31 year old Arouna Kone who is coming off the back of a career threatening injury. Rom admitted last season that he became complacent and it took being dropped from the team to realise this. Clearly he needs to be kept on his toes.

To finish this transfer window with two youngsters from South America and another winger would be severely disappointing. I'm aware either Rodriguez or Funes Mori could turn out to be world beaters but they don't address the frailties of the squad at the moment.

null,null,edent,null,null,null,"&gt; Should I get a credit card for my day to day purchases? 

That's usually the best reason to get one.  It will help build up financial discipline - as well as your credit score. 

&gt; I just don't fully understand how they work, do I spend money on it, then pay it back at the end of the month out of my current account? 

That's the best way to do it.  When you get your card, you will be given an option to set up a Direct Debit from your current account.  You can choose to pay off the minimum, or the full amount each month.

&gt; Will I have to pay interest? If so won't that make me financially worse off? 

If you pay off the **full** amount, you'll pay *no* interest.

If you miss a payment, or only make the minimum payments, you'll be hit with a high interest charge.  It will also affect your credit rating.

The most important thing about credit cards - which some people fail to realise - is that they are **not free money**.  Let's say you apply for a card and are given a £2,000 credit limit.  Does that mean you can afford to spend £2k on booze? No!  Do not be tempted to over-spend just because you can ""put it on the card.""  Only spend what you can afford to pay off each month.

Here's a slightly deeper explanation of how they work.

* Jan 1 - meal out £30.  Balance on card is £30.
* Jan 15 - new coat £50.  Balance on card is £80.
* Jan 30 - bill is issued to you for £80.  You have (depending on your card) 2 weeks to pay it off.
* Feb 5 - supermarket shop £100.  Balance on card is £180.
* Feb 14 - Direct Debit to pay off full bill -£80.  Balance on card is £100.
* Feb 28 - bill is issued for £100
* Mar 14 - you pay the minimum amount of £20.  Interest of 19% is applied to the rest.  Balance on card is £95.20.
* Apr 14  - you pay the minimum amount of £20.  Interest of 19% is applied to the rest.  Balance on card is £89.49.
* It then takes you the next few years, and several hundred pounds to clear the debt.

Your understanding is correct: you make payments using the card, and at the end of the monthly billing period, they'll send you a statement with the balance on the card. If you pay this balance *in full* by the payment due date, you won't have to pay any interest.

Savings: interest rates on savings accounts are really bad at the moment. If you want to maximise your interest, you should open one of the interest paying current accounts. You can get, I think, 5% interest (before tax) in the TSB one, but that's only for balances up to £2k. The Santander one gives you 3% on up to £20k.

I graduated uni in the UK in July, and have since moved back to my parent's house in France (since I didn't have a job or anything lined up like many of my friends), and I have just completely fallen off a cliff and sunken very deep into a depression to the point where I can't really function day to day. A few weeks ago I was still doing interval training and going to the gym. Yesterday, I managed to get myself to go to the supermarket with my mum to do the shopping and it felt like a huge challenge and it was very difficult.

I had an offer to go study at a business school in London, but I've just turned it down because I realized it wasn't for me. I have no friends left here, because I left for uni 4 years ago, so I have no social life. I have no idea what I want to do. I would like to move back to the UK and just work, but I can't since my parents live here I can't even get myself back over there to even look for jobs.

With the best will in the world, you can't hold A liable for something you were planning to do but didn't get round to. 

You could certainly enter it as evidence, but don't be surprised if the judge knocks it back, possibly with added eye rolling.

However, if the claim is that you've broken your leg and cannot use the gym, then it's perfectly reasonable to claim a pro rata'd cost of the membership. 

If you've cancelled the membership late because after the incident you've foreseen you'll be unable to use it, and by cancelling you've incurred a cost that's significantly less than the year, then there's no reason why you couldn't claim that cost as you've demonstrated that you've mitigated your losses as far as you are able.

Under those circumstances, I wouldn't even hint that you were planning to cancel prior to the incident.   

I do wonder why you've not engaged a solicitor for this, however - if it's a straight forward PI claim (insofar as any PI claim is straight forward), then these questions and others would be settled at the beginning of the claim.

He was supposed to be a big signing, the prodigal son returning to do wonders for the club he loves. But it just never happened. At least Angel had one really good season. Others have had impact, limited as it may have been. Others were never given enough chances. Collymore had chances, and made almost zero impact. He just... disappointed all over. 

I don't think you can really put players like Heskey in this category because nobody expected double figures from him. You can't disappoint if there are no real expectations. Heskey wasn't a bad footballer, he just wasn't a goalscorer. Watching him play, he did the subtle things really well. The shit that you don't see on a stats sheet.

I don't think Balaban counts either. We barely saw him play, so how could he be ""worst"" or even ""disappointing"" ..? I can do this for a lot of other players, but I have no defence for Stan, unfortunately. His Villa career was just... bad. Aside from a few bright spots like the double against Liverpool, anyway.

How much of Collymore's difficulty at Villa was down to his mental health problems, I don't know, and I'm trying to keep that in mind when I say all this, but... he was a VERY talented player (and we knew it) who basically pissed his talent away. All while at the club he claimed to love. So he's my pick. We should have been title contenders and Collymore should have been a twenty goal striker, with the squad we had at that time, IMO.

null,null,DangerZohm,null,null,null,"Here is a great example of British proaganda from the time of the Maidan Masacre. They spend about 800 words telling us how RUSSIAN troops KILLED a Ukrainian soldier, and then at the very very bottom (which I reccomend you skip too), is the following footnote: 

Selling rifles was ‘right at the time’
William Hague today defended Britain’s decision to grant licences to sell sniper rifles to Ukraine.
The foreign secretary told MPs decisions were based on ‘information available at the time’.
However, he would not say whether British experts had advised Kiev on sniper positions. Marksmen were later seen to pick off protesters in the city.

There you have it, Hague sold sniper rifles to Ukraine (Infact he sold them to an ultra-right-wing military organization known as Ukrainian National Assembly – Ukrainian People’s Self-Defense) And he probably advised them on the sniper positions too.

Notice also the subtle language difference? The Ukrainian soldier was 'killed', but the 100 protestors where 'picked off'. Disgusting reporting but it's the only rag that even bothered to mention Hague's involvement.

It's so easy to defend against us as we lack pace in the final third, I noticed this against Leicester where Erik didn't do ''much wrong'' but he couldn't really do much right either, as they had 11 men behind the ball and could just sit there with nobody probing and stretching them with pace.

The rent will be guaranteed until they get an unexpected bill and then its ""Will you mind it being a bit late this month because we've got to take the dog to the vet"" or ""can we pay you next month because the car has broken down and needs fixing?"" And you'll feel an obligation to let them off and before you know it £800 becomes several thousand quid.

&gt;  but how reasonable would it be to consider it knowing that I guarantee myself ~£800pcm

Complete madness because you can never ever guarantee the rent will be paid at all and **£800pcm on a £250k mortgage is not even going to cover the interest at 4%** which is likely to be what you're offered given how high a LTV you're going to have. Your brother is starting a 6 year degree but what is there to say that he'll do even 6 months? And if he packs it in, then what? You're a full on landlord renting to some random Joe and hoping they pay the rent every month. **You should only ever do this if you can afford to pay the mortgage without any rental income whatsoever** because its quite easy to become unstuck very quickly and arrears from a BTL hurt your credit record just as much as a personal mortgage.

Your next problem is that whereas before BTL lenders were only interested in the fact the rental value was 130% of the monthly mortgage interest payments, they now want a minimum income level which is similar to that of a personal mortgage. I was looking at getting another rental for a £85k mortgage and every lender I looked at wanted £22,000 provable income.

Your second problem is that £35k savings isn't going to be enough. 85% LTV are the highest LTV you can get and at that you're going to be ass-raped with the interest rate and the mortgage fees.

As title says really, looking for a 144Hz monitor. I can collect if anyone is near Surrey / Hampshire area, but I am willing to pay shipping costs if necessary. 
I've been looking at the BenQ XL2411z / Asus VG248qe, so if anyone has a similar spec'd monitor I may be interested!

Many thanks.

Tony Blair often carps on about achieving social justice through any means, even if you think private sector involvement is ugly. If it lowers waiting times and results in more hospitals, what exactly is the problem?

If more hospitals is your metric of success then brilliant. If having infrastructure fit for purpose is also a goal, then no there have been some massive PFI faliures. The Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham has been found by the CQC to be unfit for purpose in many areas. The drinking water supply in the entire hospital even had unsafe levels of chlorine contamination.

If you then add to that a requirement that they cost the proposed figure, then it looks pretty dire in many examples. The children's hospital next to my department is a PFI contract and is widely recognised as ridiculously expensive to run, with all procurement contracted to a choice of only one or two suppliers that typically costs more than twice other suppliers.

Also a few hospitals and the odd railway network or M25 lane extension don't constitute a few fringe cases in most people's minds.

Personally, I've no problem with private money if it makes sense. The problem is the false marketisation of natural monopolies hasn't been implemented in a sustainable way as it was promised. The fears of cost inflation on projects which are too big to fail has simply come true in too many cases.

Your use of the words should and provoke  is telling. Your putting the onus on the wrong person.

Let's step out of this example a moment. You should be allowed to wear what ever you like but if you went into a chav club decked out head to toe in goth attire some prick is likely to attack you. The person dressed as a goth is in no way at fault, yet it's still likely. Last week was the aneversary of Sophie Lancaster 's death who was murdered a certain way.

To step back into the kisses at hand. The bloke was at fault for crossing into traffic, he was warned. He then shout at her to shut up also wrong she then gestured him to fuck off. Both of these actions on her part are fairly reasonable. For him to then shove her into on coming traffic is a huge escalation not IMO within the bounds of what you would expect though I don't know the area.

Yes while you should be able to say horrible things to people one must expect some will lash out. But in that eventuality the one swinging is still 100% in the wrong.

Do a total cost calculation for the period.

You then compare that to how much the repayments would be on the SVR for the same period.

As I found on my BTL I actually ended up worse off taking a fixed/tracker deal because the arrangement and application fees more than wiped out the savings I'd make on the monthly payments.

The only caveat I would add to this is that you may still choose to do it even though it ends up being more expensive because you would rather have certainty of how much you're going to pay every month for a fixed period of time.

null,null,AeroEagle333,flair3,,null,"For those without Insider:  
The 2014 World Cup was a turning point in United States defender DeAndre Yedlin's career. The 21-year-old's breakout performance in that tournament led to a transfer from the Seattle Sounders to Tottenham Hotspur in August 2014, however a lack of playing time in the 2014-15 campaign combined with Tottenham's recent signing of Burnley defender Kevin Trippier imply that Yedlin is not quite ready to become a regular contributor to a top-flight Premier League club.

Yedlin is likely getting loaned out for all or part of the 2015-16 season -- Prem teams can execute short-term loans even after the Sept. 1 transfer deadline -- and this loan spell will be important to continue the positive momentum he built at the World Cup and since then in international competition. In the past, the development of promising American players like Jozy Altidore and Julian Green have stalled due unsuccessful loan spells, and it is important that Yedlin goes to a club that allows him to showcase his defensive abilities while also allowing him to get forward and help create chances from wide positions in the team's attack. So far, Yedlin has been linked to clubs in the Premier League, English Championship, Serie A and Ligue 1, with no clear destination.

Here is a look at how Yedlin would (or wouldn't) fit the clubs where he has recently been linked -- including Premier League sides Norwich City and West Bromwich Albion, English Championship clubs Birmingham City, Derby County, Bolton and Fulham, Ligue 1 side Lyon and Roma of Serie A -- along with an assessment of the best loan destination for him this season.

Premier League interest
Yedlin has recently been linked to Norwich City, and earlier in the summer the U.S. right back was linked to West Bromwich Albion. Both teams could provide Yedlin with playing opportunities, and pose different strengths and weaknesses for Yedlin's career.

Norwich is a potentially good fit for Yedlin because of the team's propensity for playing along the right side. Norwich currently ranks fifth in the league with 226 touches per game on the right third of the field, and those touches represent 37 percent of the team's total possession. This right-sided focus would benefit Yedlin, as the former Seattle Sounders defender would bring additional speed to Norwich as it looks to create opportunities from that side of the field. Yedlin led the U.S. with 4.0 take-ons per 90 minutes in the 2015 Gold Cup, and this ability to dribble at defenders would bring an added dimension to a Norwich team that currently ranks 16th in the 2015-16 Prem with just 14.7 take-ons per game.

Conversely, Yedlin's playing time at Norwich could be stunted by incumbent right back Steven Whittaker. The 31-year-old Scottish international currently ranks third on Norwich with five total tackles, and ranks second on the team with 202 total touches and 123 completed passes. Whittaker's presence creates potential playing-time issues for Yedlin, as Norwich will likely need a veteran defensive presence while fighting to maintain a place in the Prem. ESPN FC analyst Jeff Carlisle provides further insight, asserting that with relegated teams, ""the goal becomes to avoid the drop, and you're not going to be depending on kids to get you out of that. You're going to use tried and true vets -- as many of them that are available -- to help you grind your way out of that.""

West Brom faces a similar relegation threat, and has gotten off to a slow start in 2015-16. The team currently ranks 18th in the Prem with 17 shots conceded per game, which is a regression from the team conceding 14.4 shots per game in the 2014-15 campaign. Yedlin has recently improved his defending - he ranked third on the U.S. with 11 total tackles and 11 interceptions through the team's 2015 friendlies -- and could benefit a West Brom team that is allowing opponents to create more chances from the attacking left third of the field so far in 2015-16. Similar to Norwich, Yedlin's biggest obstacle at West Brom is playing time, and the U.S. international would need to supplant 25-year-old right back Craig Dawson to earn significant minutes. Dawson led West Brom with 6.8 clearances per 90 minutes in 2014-15, and is a physical defender who excels in man-marking and avoiding defensive lapses, so Yedlin would need the opportunity to prove a similar level of defensive value in order to earn significant playing time.

English Championship suitors
Another loan path for Yedlin could be the English Championship, where several clubs have expressed interest in his services -- including Birmingham City, Derby County, Bolton and Fulham -- and the budding talent can hone his skills before returning to Tottenham. The Championship would provide Yedlin with the playing time that he needs at this stage in his development, while also sidestepping the distractions that exist when trying to adjust to a different European culture.

This makes sense from the parent club's perspective as well.

""Tottenham are going to be able to want to go and see him, and I think he's going to have a little bit more of an opportunity to shine in the Championship,"" added Carlisle. ""There's a better chance that he would see the field, and he'll be able to make some mistakes without the fear of being pulled.""

Of the interested clubs, Derby County provides the best fit. Derby finished in eighth place in the 2014-15 Championship, and ideally Yedlin would be loaned to a team with promotion potential. Derby in particular ranked fourth in the 2014-15 Championship with 85 goals under former manager Steve McClaren, and thrived with a fast-paced, counterattacking style of play. This style would be ideal for Yedlin's ability to create chances along the right side, and the 21-year-old would thrive with opportunities to dribble at defenders in open space.

New Derby County manager Paul Clement has adopted a similar attacking philosophy. Clement prefers to attack opponents with a mix of heavy midfield possession and direct passes into the attacking third, and Yedlin would help the team by using his speed to make runs off the ball along the right side. In a small four-game snapshot of the 2015-16 season, Derby leads the Championship with 294 completed passes per game in the middle third of the field. The team also leads the Championship with 57 completed long balls per game this season, and illustrates that Derby could not only attack opponents with quick passes in midfield, but also utilize Yedlin as a threat to make attacking runs behind opposing defenders and be a threat to get on the end of long passes.

For Yedlin, it is important to have teammates who can maintain possession in midfield, and Carlisle further asserts that ""someone's got to get him the ball. It's not like he's a central midfielder who's going to help them keep the ball better, he's more of a player who's going to get on the end of things."" Derby could be good fit in this regard as well.

European leagues/teams
Yedlin's loan interest also includes teams throughout Europe, with rumored suitors including Lyon in France's Ligue 1 and Roma in Italy's Serie A. Lyon is known for developing young players, and the team's second-place finish in Ligue 1 last season suggests that the team is capable of competing with the best clubs in Europe. Lyon has shown that it likes to press opponents with attacking pressure, and ranked second in the 2014-15 Ligue 1 season with 320 attacking-half touches per game. Conceptually, Lyon makes sense for Yedlin, especially considering the potential for Champions League minutes. However, in this situation he will have stiff competition from former Manchester United defender Rafael for playing time.

There is also rumored interest from Roma in Serie A, and similar to Lyon there is potential for Yedlin to earn minutes within the team's crowded domestic and international schedule. Yedlin would be a good loan fit for Roma, as the team prefers to play an open style. Roma ranked third in the Serie A with 21.3 take-ons per game in the 2014-15 season, and created a league high 4.2 chances per game from the right side of the field. However, Yedlin would be in direct competition with 24-year-old Italian international Alessandro Florenzi at the right back position, and might struggle to earn the consistent playing time necessary to continue developing as a player.

Best fit
Yedlin's top priority must be earning significant playing time while also playing at a club that can support his defensive and attacking capabilities. This would be difficult outside of England, as the clubs that are reportedly interested in his services currently have right-sided players with a longer track record of European experience. Staying in England is likely the best move for Yedlin this season, and in particular Championship-side Derby County would offer the ideal fit for the U.S. international as he would likely receive playing time on a competitive team that has a strong foundation on both ends of the field.",null,0,null,1440762814,null,null,false,0,cuiiowc,null,t3_3ipslt,null,null,null,t3_3ipslt,null,null,null,1441546872,null,6,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,6,null

null,null,jcxyuz,null,null,null,"I got passed fit to work in 2009, thought I was being assessed by a doctor but it was a former nurse employed by Atos.  I had been signed off indefinitely at 24.  I have mental health problems and had been on incapacity benefit for 6 years.  I thought this assessment would have been like the one previously where I would explain what I do daily just to keep on going and that nothing had changed.  I had not seen a doctor in the previous 5 years since rehab.  Saw too many doctors the year prior to rehab and did not trust them anymore.  I got passed fit to work, incapacity and housing benefit stopped and not put on any other benefits.  

I found out when the Giros stopped coming, I appealed the decision and while waiting for the appeal had to go on JSA.  The appeal failed so I was stuck looking for work.  My Cv is good because I was successful when I worked previously but I could not get interviews.  I did voluntary work for 3 years while looking for a job and to have current work experience and references.  I was then placed on the work programme and volunteered with the work programme provided for a year and still could not get many interviews, the ones I got where unsuccessful.  I thought I might get a job with the work programme provider as voluntary work was supposed to be 6 months only and I was kept on after the 6 months and after my time on the Work Programme but stayed on for 6 months more without any prospect of employment.  

Post Work Programme the job centre staff had a different way of treating you.  Aimed at making you want out of benefit, giving weird things that you had to do every week to not get sanctioned and have no money for 4 weeks.  I ended up after 4 years of looking for work seeing a disability employment agent who said that I was disabled and could use that to get interviews.  Got a job working in a similar kind of industry as before rehab and have been employed for a year and half but....

I am off work sick again, gave in to seeing a doctor and medication, been off work for two months and because I am still employed I can't get help financially, income support or housing benefit and was supposed to be off another month but going back to work in a week as have to pay bills.  

It's frustrating to be stuck like this.  After 4 years on JSA and telling them I think I was passed fit by mistake.  One and a half years of work later I'm sicker than before but still employed so now that I can be off sick there's no support so going back to work to see what happens.

Started a blog to help people with Post Work Programme problems and the comments are interesting but gave it up when I started working

Eventually they had to change their mind, and discharge 175 men. Hard to argue the UDR were not state sponsored terrorists.

Ultimately why would fiat banks want to continue trading with exchanges to a currecy and a technology that renders their services useless?

null,null,IxionS3,null,null,null,"AIUI you have 2 potential issues.

Issue 1 is your tax code, which should be on your payslips. Your tax code tells your employer how much personal allowance you have; i.e. how much you can earn tax-free.  The ""normal"" tax code this year is 1060L which tells an employer you have £10,600 in personal allowance (the allowance is the number multiplied by 10).

If you have 2 jobs then by default HMRC will assign half of your personal allowance to each employer, so £5,300 each.  If the income from the 2 jobs are not roughly equal you can end up ""wasting"" some of your allowance in one job and paying tax you don't need to in the other (it's not really wasted because in the long run you should get overpayments back, but obviously you'd prefer that money now).

The good news is you can speak to HMRC and adjust the split of your allowance however you like.

Issue 2 is that PAYE (Pay as You Earn, the system employers use to calculate and pay tax on your behalf) isn't set up for short-term contracts.  You know you're only working for 8 weeks, your employer knows you're only working for 8 weeks, but HMRC forces them to calculate tax on the assumption that you're working right through to the end of the tax year in April.  Again this may lead to you being overtaxed since the system splits your allowance over the full year.

The bad news is there's nothing you can do about this problem up-front.  It used to be the case that students doing summer jobs could fill in a form to be paid gross, but that was abolished.  Now you have to pay the tax and get a refund.  The good news is, as a student, you can potentially get the money back at the start of next term rather than having to wait until the end of the tax year.  The form for this is the [P50]
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/income-tax-claiming-tax-back-when-you-have-stopped-working-p50).

No I didn't, because they aren't, but I think it's quite clear that some of them are.

You can't argue with the facts though, the high levels of immigration correlate directly with a sharp increase in crime, especially hate crimes and rape in Sweden and no amount of beating around the bush or whataboutery changes that, they might be escaping human rights abuses but that doesn't mean they get carte-blanche to violate the rights of those in the countries they move to.

If it's a problem that has to be taken care of then it had to be done in a sustainable way, there is absolutely no point in inviting immigrants into a country if there is absolutely nowhere to house them and no services to handle them.

All that's happening at the moment is they are creating their own little segregated ghettos, not integrating with the native population and causing trouble to the point where emergency services aren't willing to intervene and public services are having to close to prevent trouble.

Without adequate housing and services then all that will happen is they'll continue to be in dire poverty, they will continue to commit a disproportionate amount of crime and they'll continue to fuck everything up for the rest of the population which will just stoke the fires of animosity.

I mean look at the immigrant amnesty in the 2010 campaign. That's hardly a popular decision, but Clegg ran with it full throttle.

As for the Greens, I think we are a generation away from the British electorate taking a Green party seriously, but in time it will happen, just as it has happened across the continent.

What I will say, though, is that Labour is currently killing itself by positioning itself as electable by the middle class. Maybe we're seeing the full fruition of Thatcher's long con, that by making the country middle class through property investment and Right To Buy, she would in time completely destroy socialism in Britain. Even if that's inaccurate, Labour's shunning of socialism and embrace of 'progressivism' is disingenuous.

If the middle-class bourgeois want to position themselves that way then fine, but I personally take issue with them doing it under the banner of the British Labour movement. This leadership campaign shows that Labour isn't interested in the working class any more. For heaven's sake, the Tories have taken ownership of the phrase 'working people'. When was the last time Labour made a strong soundbite which included the word 'working'?

null,null,Firefox7275,null,null,null,"Water is not always pH neutral, depends how hard or soft it is. Rainwater is slightly acidic, hard tap water can have an alkaline pH so be problematic for some skin types. Hence the legend about Bioderma inventing no-rinse micellar water (Parisian water is apparently hard).

Kind of depends what specific cleanser you use, your skin type, actual pH of the tap water, how long you are exposed for. Water alone won't stuff the acid mantle/ beneficial flora because some of that habitat is oily or waxy, oil and water don't mix and water does not contain any emulsifying ingredients.

Nor will a super gentle cleanser decimate everything and some cleansers even deposit a thin protective layer that should 'buffer' again the water.

Some products have 'unused' acids or alkalis suspended  in the formulation, so when they are mixed with tap water surprising things can happen to the pH. This is partly why /r/Asianbeauty/ try to test cleansers in the state they are actually used (eg. mixed with some tap water).

Any cleanser that is high pH (true soap) or contains very strong detergents (sulphates, olefin sulfonates), is highly efficient at stripping away every trace of sweat, sebum and beneficial microbes, so really the effect of the pH neutral water afterwards is negligible.

Even if the pH of skin goes off a little but not enough to destroy the acid mantle/ beneficial flora, the skin should be able to reset. HOWEVER aging skin or skin that is diseased (g. rosacea, eczema) may take much longer to reset or completely fail to do so. Whilst the pH is off there is increased potential for pathogenic bacteria to take hold, this can sometimes lead to infections in eczema or pimples in acne.

A bit of a waffly 'round the houses' sort of explanation, sorry! I have not managed to sleep as yet.",null,0,null,1440765737,null,null,false,0,cuijsss,null,t3_3iplbi,null,null,null,t3_3iplbi,null,null,null,1441547395,null,4,null,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,4,null

American Football is what we call it. Some people might watch the Superbowl, but that is because it is on in the middle of the night which makes it an ""event"" to stay up and get drunk and watch the show. This as an event is so bizzare to us, we don't make such a palaver over something like the FA Cup Final say, which adds to the interest. No other American Football would be on our radar at all. I have never seen it played here apart from a few people in University who tried it out. We have Rugby which satisfies our oval-balled full body contact needs. We really can't get past all the padding, the rules, and the bursts of play where nothing really happens (and you can't even tell where the ball is) followed by ten minutes of fannying about.

Baseball - I doubt many people understand the rules (or the scoring anyway), and we tend to associate it with the children's game of Rounders which we grew out of by the age of about 10. The bats are popular as a weapon however. We have cricket to satisfy any urges to hit balls with sticks. 

Basketball - used to play this in school, you see basketball hoops in parks quite often too, plus in sports centres. It is a good game for just picking up a ball and having informal games with I suppose. Watching actual games though - no. Netball is a game that all girls would play in school which is similar.

Ice Hockey - there are teams across the UK actually, anywhere with an ice rink would have one probably, but ice rinks are closing down constantly. Very low profile, I have never known anyone who can play (or who even ice skates regularly).

I think it's good for young players to get a year away from the division they struggled in. Look at Sanogo.

A few years back you had the Lukaku loans too, but he's suited for this league and didn't have issues with adapting.

The problem is, as I see it, that offended people are like a force in themselves. Offence is like a prerogative to be a dick about things and take up people's time telling them about their offence. It's like a mind-virus. The offended person seeks to spread their notion of offence.

The more people get offended, the more they are dicks towards others. The idea of reducing the amount of offence isn't so much about reducing *offence*, per se, it's more about reducing the amount of goddamn dickery and time-wasting which that offence generates.

Although if someone's offended, and *doesn't act like a dick about it* then they might as well not be offended in the first place. That could more accurately be classified as ""having a thought about something""

null,null,GuyWithoutABeard,,Newry,null,"&gt; Mr Hamilton said that ""some of the Provisional IRA structure from the 1990s remains broadly in place"" but its purpose ""has radically changed since this period"". The police assessment, he said, is that the Provisional IRA remains committed to politics and is not engaged in terrorism.

I'd call that 'inactive' for a paramilitary group. 

&amp; how about this. This is what Peter Robinson said about the Unionist Forum:
&gt;Asked if he would talk to loyalist paramilitaries, he replied: ""We will talk to anyone who wants to talk to us about how we can move forward in an exclusively peaceful and democratic manner.

Now..considering the PSNI are backing Sinn Fein's commitment to peace:
&gt;The Chief Constable stood by his assessment that the IRA exists and that some members were involved in Kevin McGuigan's murder but he backed Sinn Féin’s commitment to peace.

So that, coupled with *the best intelligence we have indicates that* the PIRA are not active in any military sense, makes me very confused about Nesbitt's stance here. If he wants to create an opposition, all well and good, but his excuse for it is hypocritical when he wants to move forward during the protests though exclusively peaceful means with discussion, but cannot stay in the assembly [because he does not trust in their commitment to the peace process](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-34063087)

You have to admit it's a bit all over the show.


*PS: It really wasn't difficult to find all this out either. In fact, the UUP were in government with Sinn Fein long before decommissioning, so I don't understand his reasons at all.

There’s a [huge number of problems with the Lords](https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/39i1ay/the_house_of_lords_should_not_be_elected/cs3ki23) that goes well beyond nepotism and hereditary privilege.

There’s also the issue of how to appoint these “experts” as you’ll get career climbers and backroom agreements in most industries (and in academia). Reputation isn’t always a measure of actual ability or knowledge.

I never said that I thought EVERY mugger would potentially murder you instantly for none compliance, I asked the question if you could be sure that a mugger wouldn't.  And the fact that you've replied with the following show that you agree that you can't be sure:

&gt; I still wouldn't tell a mugger 'no' if they've got me at knifepoint, because I have no way of knowing if it's a bluff and would rather not find out.

You've deliberately misinterpreted my post.  My point was that you can't know/be sure of how far someone's willing to go in a violent altercation.

&gt;  Just look at George Zimmerman &amp; Trayvon Martin - the situation could have been a complete non-event, but instead they both kept escalating things until one ended up dead. Completely avoidable.

In the case of the Martin shooting by Zimmerman, Martin was running away.  Zimmerman CHASED HIM.  The whole controversy of the case was that Zimmerman chased down an unarmed man and shot him following an altercation.  Did I say that people should chase down unarmed people to shoot them?  No, I said you could potentially scare them off.  Again, you've missed my point and brought up a completely irrelevant issue.

&gt;  That rule is just about the bare minimum of safe gun handling

No it isn't.  The rule of safe gun handling is to minimise the chances that you would harm someone UNINTENTIONALLY.  The idea that something like a firearm should remain in its holster until you're absolutely sure you need to use it is A RIDICULOUS MYTH.  Do you think that when entering a building where there are unconfirmed reports of an armed suspect, armed police officers always do so with their weapons still in the hosters?  No I don't think you do because that would be stupid.

I also trust my wife. I know she's not going to spend our money irresponsibly. I wouldn't have married her if I thought she would. 

We are both free to spend money from the joint account without checking with the other, as we both know that the other will not do anything ridiculous. I bought tickets to a wrestling show yesterday.

To be fair to him, a lot of people don't really understand the politics of the EU. Its not taught, unless you do Politics in A-level, and even then its up to the school to choose whether they want to do British and American politics or British and EU politics.

&gt; the migrant crisis has been handled terribly (well mostly just ignored) and people's lives are at stake.

Aye it has been ignored, but probably because no one really knows what to do about it. You can't just share out the migrants between the states, because that's really invasive by the EU on the sovereignty of the nation states (You have to accept these people against your will). Do we let them all in? That would just empower the human traffickers because more will want to get it. Do we block them off? People will drown or live the rest of their life in a no man's land.

The joint account is topped up as necessary  to cover major expenses (plane tickets, Christmas presents for family).

We also have our personal accounts, where our wages are paid into.    Anything left over from paying into the joint account is our own to manage.  This mainly means that we can buy things for ourselves (clothes, games, etc) without consulting each other, as well as being able to buy gifts without the other finding out.  Any savings eventually makes its way into an ISA.

The additional advantage of having multiple current accounts is the in-credit interest we earn.  My personal account and the joint account both get a bit of interest each month.  Hubby can't be bothered with researching and switching banks so he has a basic current account.


It works for us at the moment because our salaries are pretty close; not sure if it will change over time.   Hubby's earning potential is much greater than mine.  On the other hand, my savings is much greater than his.  We want to buy a house someday, so I'll probably contribute most of the deposit, whereas I imagine he'll contribute a greater proportion to the mortgage.

&gt; The IRA's changing business practices are revealed in a cable by Jonathan Benton, the then deputy chief of mission at the American embassy in Dublin, which reported on meetings with senior Irish police officers and senior officials from the department of justice.

Hi there,

I am looking for the above. Preferably a 32gb kit of Dominator but I may purchase 16 if it's for a good price.

Paying via PayPal and available for collection in Sheffield if need be.

Thanks,

null,null,wanson,lfc68,,null,"Just want to say that not everybody hates the idea of Markovic going on loan this season. It could do him the world of good.

When Sturridge is back in the side, he and Benteke, will start most games. Either in a 4-4-2 diamond or a 4-3-3 with Sturridge shifted slightly wide. Then take into account that Moreno had come on as a left winger in his last two games and had looked really good there, I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes his preferred position.

That means Markovic will be competing with Sturridge, Coutinho, Firmino, Lallana, Ibe, Origi and Moreno for 1 of 2 spots. 

People will argue that there will be Europa League games and League Cup games, which there will. There will be 6 Europa League group stage games and potentially 6 League cup games IF we make the final. I'd expect us to field a stronger XI in the knockout rounds of the EL if we get that far. Edit: He's also banned for the first four EL games due to the red he picked up against Basle

So that's 8 games where he could potentially play, compared to the 30 odd he could get at Fenerbache. Then there's no guarantee that he'd make the starting XI in those cup games. Even if we start a completely different first team for these games, here's how we might line up:

                Bogdan
    Flanagan*   Toure  Sakho   Moreno
       Allen    Lucas    Rossiter
         Ibe     Ings     Origi

     *when fit, otherwise Clyne or Gomez or even Ilori.

Then there's still the likes of Can, Lallana, Teixera and Ilori, that will likely not be regular starters in every league game. So, there's no guarantee that he'd even start the cup games or be an impact sub.

Ibe and Lallana haven't looked great in the few games we've played this season it's true. But they were very good at the tail end of last season, especially Lallana. I wouldn't rule them out just yet. Ibe will be dropped for Firmino and Lallana for Sturridge as soon as he's fit and Ibe is a great option off the bench to stretch things at the end of a game.

I think Markovic will have much more opportunities in Fenerbahce. If he can nail down a first team spot and improve his composure and confidence it could be great for him. I think he'll do really well in Turkey and next season we might actually have a £20m winger on our hands.

Her platform is vague and uninspiring.
* Jeremy Corbyn - His platform is clear but it's old Labour and he dares to call it a radical new style of politics, and when I say ""Old Labour"" I mean Old Labour, the kind of shit you'd expect in the 30's and 40's that wasn't popular in the 1980's let alone contemporary society. His approach to building a manifesto is also appalling and will lead to a disjointed joke.
* Liz Kendall - to her credit she's got a clear platform and has stuck to her views throughout, unfortunately for her and us she represents next to nobody.
* Andy Burnham - He's done a fair bit of flip flopping, not on huge issues thankfully but enough to garner a reputation. Frankly he's getting my vote because he's a safe pair of hands - in that his drivel and contemporaries won't drive away voters in mass so inevitably in 2020 we have a strong voting base still for his succeeder to run and hopefully win with.",null,1,null,1440769576,null,null,false,0,cuillmv,null,t3_3iq3wl,null,null,null,t3_3iq3wl,null,null,null,1441548244,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,null,JB_UK,null,null,null,"Yeah, that's perfectly possible. After all, 'SJW' attitudes towards sexual assault have come increasingly into force during the last few decades. To take a drastic example, it's not long since assaults within relationship were not treated as a crime in a lot of Western countries, and I would think would not be treated seriously in many parts of a lot of European countries even today, and certainly not many developing countries. In most countries, the statistics for date rape prosecutions are very low in comparison to reported incidence, and so on, so there's huge potential for altering the statistics through changing social attitudes, and practices of recording.

One of the funny things about the way these statistics are deployed is that the rape rates in the countries where the immigrants have come from are very low.  For instance, look at the Gatestone Institute's page [Sweden: Rape Capital of the World](http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/5195/sweden-rape). They prominently display the UN figures, and then in the text blame immigrants from Morocco, Algeria, Iraq, Sudan, etc. But when you look at [the same figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics#Rape_statistics_by_country), for rape incidence in those countries, for Sweden it is 64 per 100,000 per year, for Morocco 5, Algeria 2.5, Sudan 2.9, and so on. Ultimately, either these statistics are not consistent enough to make direct comparisons between countries, or, if the statistics are correct, it is wrong to blame Sweden's high rate on Islamic attitudes towards women.",null,0,null,1440770155,null,null,1440771004,0,cuilwr1,null,t3_3imciw,null,null,null,t1_cuiftjm,null,null,null,1441548389,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

On r/unitedkingdom there is a very clear left wing slant, on r/ukpolitics it is far more subtle and while still evident with misrepresentation of the Tories and almost equal UKIP, it is not as large as r/unitedkingdom where there is a very clear pattern emerging.

We can therefore only assume there is a massive war going on in Nigeria right now that we don't know about, huge amounts of persecution, or they are illegally entering the EU for primarily economic reasons. They want jobs or benefits, iPhones and cars, money to send home, build their parents a house, support their ill family members, etc. Completely noble if somewhat materialistic reasons.

American football has many facets. I agree with you it isn't as taxing in terms of running stamina. But imagine having to spend 11 minutes over a 3 hour period trying to move the fattest/strong human being that wants to be moving in the exact opposite direction. If you tell me that isn't physically exhausting I suggest you tryout at an amateur football league and tell me how many days afterwards you feel fit to do it all over again. It is like telling a weightlifter that after a competition that he doesn't need any amount of rest because it only took him a few seconds to lift a billion pounds. The logic just doesn't add up. Also the amount of injuries in football is a big reason why bye weeks (weeks off) are like gold. Literally every player is playing with niggling injuries by the end of the season.

- Bourdeaux --&gt; Norwich: Not too shabby considering it's Norwich, Coutinho to hit long shots for fun
- Sion --&gt; Everton: Zero travel involved
- Kazan --&gt; So'ton: Zero travel involved
- Kazan --&gt; Palace: At least it's a home match, but this is definitely the only fixture that is relatively concerning. At least it's likely an earlier matchup meaning the club can either get some rest or take the night plane back. Heck, the day of travel might be a good thing for some of the first team regulars who go
- Bordeaux --&gt; Swansea: zero travel involved
- Sion --&gt; West Brom: A little trickier but hopefully the club could get away with playing some reserves vs. Sion. WBA also isn't the worst of fixtures to have after an EL match

In an attacking trident alongside Totti and Osvaldo, defences simply could not handle his combination of flash trickery and potent finishing. Many Roma fans went on to label Erik as the ‘heir to Totti’, with the Italian being a player who has made his mark in the game by playing as a ‘trequartista’ behind a lone striker.

I have to disagree with everyone's belief that Peace just fucked up and is a dummy. Every indication is that he's a quite capable chairman, not unlike our own. 

I think the fans who compare their stance re: Berahino similar to our stance re: Modric are the ones who have it right. WBA might have an unsettled player on their hands like we did, but their hope, similar to our's, is that he either goes for a crazy amount of money (we also hoped for out of the prem since Modric didn't have HG or English status) or stays and performs. Whether that pans out is another story, but it's a gamble that I think Peace was willing to take all along given how close to relegation's edge WBA has been over the past couple of years.

null,null,joethepro36,null,null,null,"&gt;I want to say something about the issue of the refugees -never ever again migrants- that are swamping Europe.
&gt;And with misleading terminology such as ‘migrants’.

Bit of a joke to call them all refugees really. Not that many are specifically Libyans or Syrians for instance. It is factually wrong to call them all refugees. Basically just left wing partisan hackery really.

My biggest issue with the article is that the author assumes and states that Europe taking in these immigrants is not only required but we aren't going far enough. In reality, we have no obligation to take anyone in, just letting them come to Europe alone is evidence enough of compassion. Europe does not owe these people a thing and that is the crux of the issue, that we are not obligated to give out our wealth to anyone who comes here. 

The article was decently summed up well enough in a tl;dr in the comments:

Playing some undeveloped youth player who will never be an elite player (and therefore good enough to win us the Champions League) is a complete waste of time.   

City want to win.  For that you need to play your best players.  If a youth player is good enough they will play.  If there are injuries they can play and do a job like Pozo did last season even though he showed he wasn't quite ready.    

If things were as dire as you say, then why are young players from around the world lining up to sign for City?  Because they know that even if they don't make City's first team, there is probably only 3 or 4 other teams in the world that can set you up for an amazing professional career in the sport and that MCFC is one of them.  Any player coming from this system will get scouted harder and longer and get more opportunity than a kid getting released from Barnsley or Villarreal.

Europe is already filling up with quality players who are former City academy players.  And City is making money from their transfers that further allows them to buy elite players like Otamendi and Sterling.   Plus, with sell-on fees and buy backs, there is little downside.

All in all, Citys youth policy (which copies those successful systems of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus and Chelsea) is a fantastic success already and its just starting.  And it's successful for young players as much as it is the team.   These players are all making shitloads of money thanks to coming to City.

It's fun and exciting, despite the fact NYCFC sucks!  Our men's national team is...ok, but more people care now!  Our women won the World Cup!  MLS is growing and becoming more popular!  It's the soccer rapture right now over here.

Yet for some reason, even the mention of MLS brings all the Euro fanboys saying ""haha what a crap league, you're a retirement league, that's classic MLS defending, etc.""  I mean, would I want an MLS team to be able to sign a guy like Eden Hazard in his prime?  Hellz yeah.  But the financial reality prevents that.  But an aging Pirlo or Drogba is way better than what used to be in the league.  And we're starting to get high-quality younger players more so in their prime (Giovinco is absurd.)

Just think about it like this: the USA didn't even have a tier 1 (tier 1 by our standards) pro league until 1996 (the older North American Soccer league, the one with Pele and Beckenbauer, financially imploded in 1985 after only 15 years).  FIFA forced us to make one in order to get the 94 World Cup - basically, the MLS was the red-headed stepchild for about 10 years.  So, we've made a lot of progress.

Boston has a subway system that is admittedly terrible compared to the tube - it's cramped, slow, and deafeningly loud - but during rush hour the trains at least turn up frequently enough to get people to and from work.

The buses, on the other hand. The fucking buses. It's like they took the concept of a timetable, decided it was an optional European fantasy, and deep fried it.

There's no bus-stop monitor for when the next bus is coming. Buses can turn up 20 or 30 minutes late. I've waited at a bus stop where two services run, each three times an hour, and waited for 25 minutes. 

The average time it takes to get from my house to the connecting subway station is literally double what it says on the schedule, even during the middle of the day when there's no traffic.

I have been photographed in the street after being asked for my permission, years ago by a magazine looking for 'local character' doing portraits for a feature. I had no problem with this as they asked and (I was a lot younger) I felt it was an interesting thing to do.

When I'm out and about and for example see people taking photos of street art (I live in Bristol, it's everywhere here) I try not to get in the shot, I just don't want to be in their photos. Obviously I can't do that 100% but I am mindful of not ruining their shot, and not being the subject (title: grumpy old man walking past a beautiful mural, etc).

Weddings? Fair game I would assume, you are at an event that is being documented and unless you had good reason not to then you will be photographed there.

Concerts. Background is fine, a candid 'portrait' type image isn't, same as on the street. 

My basic issue with this type of photography is not of being a small anonymous background character, that is fine, but being the main 'subject' without my consent or knowledge.

So, I can't completely avoid being photographed, I know that. If I am asked (and give consent) then that's fine. If I am a tiny part in the background of a scene, that is fine. If someone is a dick and gets right up in my face and takes a photo of me without any consent, that is not ok.

Hope that helps.

Lille is not a ""high"" European level.  It's a middling European level and he was inconsistent (even though injuries played their part)

Making money is not a fundamentally flawed outlook.  City need to generate funds to buy players.   This is just like ticket sales and TV money.  A form of revenue.  And a good one.  We got more for Lopes than Jovetic.   That right there says what a good value it is.

And I'm judging based upon two factors: The lesser one being my own eyes, I've watched him at Lille and during City pre-seasons etc.   And 2: If City thought he was going to be elite and make it they would offer him £200,000 a week and be playing him.  That's a fact.

He will not be asked to cover defensively if playing wide in a front 3, and he will be able to counter attack quickly while hopefully pulling one of the bodies out of the box, opening things up for Benteke.

Fair enough point about not getting games for Marko. I think Lucas will be used tactically in games like Arsenal, Allen is a rotation player, and Origi and Ings may not see the pitch much in the EPL. That leaves Lallana along with Can, who will both rotate with the squad. They are both pretty versatile, as well, so I don't worry about their time--it'll come.

I'm mostly just wary because this tactic has been used a lot and I can't recall a time it's been successful. If we wanted to blood Markovic, surely a PL side would've taken him on loan?

null,null,[deleted],null,null,null,"Though I'll reserve my final judgment until we see how Pochettino actually handles this, I am among those who think that this draw *could be* bad for us, at least as things stand today.  This has to do with what playing against these teams requires of a squad that has an unsettling lack of depth in certain positions.  Spurs want to take the EL seriously.  This obviously means advancing from the group stage.  Advancing from the group stage when you're up against two other high quality teams means fielding a strong starting XI in possibly four out of six games.  This could mean an even greater strain on some of our best players, who, with our lack of depth, could be running themselves into the ground even without these EL games.  We all saw how Eriksen became a shadow of himself near the close of last season, and how our play suffered from it.  This year, with no true striker as backup, I fear Kane could be another victim of Pochettino's unwillingness to rest our top players.  If last year's EL games, against really poor opposition, were a curse on our subsequent PL matches, I'm afraid of what this year's games, against teams that will really demand our best, will take from our PL campaign.

In addition to the demand this could be on our strongest players, it will preclude those youngsters who rarely get time in domestic competitions from getting a chance to show what they can do in an actual match.  How different could Kane's carreer have been if he didn't get his apps in the EL last fall?  I worry that we could be missing out on the rise of some top talent if we don't have the EL to give them a shot.

Finally, before anyone objects that this is something we'd have to deal with in the CL too, if we ever got one of those spots: getting into the CL would mean a guaranteed income of millions more than we'll get from the EL.  It would also make the club far more attractive for prospective players.  Thus, it would be much easier to acquire the quality squad depth that is required to field a strong team in both the CL and domestic competitions, without running our best players utterly ragged, like Eriksen was last year.",null,0,null,1440774563,null,null,1440774808,0,cuioie3,null,t3_3ipx3p,null,null,null,t3_3ipx3p,null,null,null,1441549615,null,1,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

        Lamela      Eriksen     Son

                      Kane

Id imagine that Lamela is the most contentious of those choices however people shouldnt forget that he was probably our best player the back end of last season. A poor 20 minutes vs Stoke has couloured peoples opinions on him far too much IMO. Hes also our best presser. You would worry how the fans seemingly turning on him will affect him however...

If we dont sign anyone else then:

                         Lloris

       Walker    Toby    Vertonghen   Rose

               Dembele     Eriksen      Son

                              Kane

Unless we get a specialist DM I feel that we need Dembele reinforcing us at Cm, I know his starting position is from the left but in reality he has been playing as an auxillary CM, rotating in and covering for our CM's - a bit like the job Ramires does for Chelsea when hes asked to play there

It's obvious that they don't want to spend money, you seriously can't disagree with that? All the deals that have fallen through this summer have been because we haven't been willing to stump up the extra cash (Mirallas, Yilmaz, Ayew) and so we go back in for a 32 (next year) year old striker who we failed to get in January who is notorious for being shit if he's not seen as the top dog by the manager/club. Adebayor is not quite good enough to be a starter in our team, but he's too good to be a bench-warmer all the time (when all strikers are fit obviously). I've gone by this all summer, if we were going to get a striker, even on a short term deal, it should have been one to challenge Carroll and Sakho.

Basically, as grateful as I am to them for 'saving' us, I think our owners, or perhaps just Sullivan, are incompetent, misguided and, most importantly, stingy.

The economic case for solar in the UK at currents costs is marginal at best. Although a reasonably sized domestic installation has come down from £20,000 to £5,000 in 5 years, partly due to European policies and partly from Chinese manufacturing. 

The Tories can easily prove that domestic solar is uneconomic and use this to justify cutting the FIT. They aren't against solar, they just don't want to subsidise one of the most expensive forms of generation (which it is because we ignore carbon costs). Funnily enough a lot of Tory votes will have benefited generously from the FIT. 

I don't support the cut, selfishly because I work in the industry, but I try to see both sides and can understand why. 

Personally I'd like to see the FIT remain but at a lower level, this would incentivise installers to drive down costs further. 87% is basically killing it dead in all but name. Plus there's a cap which will be hit very quickly each year. I think there are a lot of additional economic benefits from installation work, community projects and the fact that people with solar tend to engage better with energy and reduce their use even further. There's also a significant uplift from respending of the investment in local economies. 

Plus if module costs keep reducing at the rate they are, it would be good to have an industry ready to gear up if it hits grid parity (it's already close for large non-domestic systems with significant on-site demand). Also, the domestic sector is responsible for 40% of our emissions and there are very few choices left for people wanting to reduce the energy used by their homes.

The best episodes of Who are when they make something out of either the Doctor's long life/abilities/physiology, or the mechanics of time travel with the TARDIS. Those things are unique (or nearly so, depending on how tight your definition and how many media we're including) to the show, and it's amazing when done properly. 

When the TARDIS takes the show to outer space or sometime in the past and there are [monsters/aliens/whatever] that they need to defeat before [plot device], it's (hopefully) an ok episode, but it's not one anyone remembers because honestly, it's the sort of thing we've seen before and could see somewhere else. Star Trek could (and often did) do an episode like that. Battlestar Galactica, Stargate, even Supernatural could do an episode like that, and so it feels like a waste: he's got a TARDIS and all it did was take him to some random spaceship with an alien killing the crew? 

But take that same basic idea and put some real TARDIS on it and you get ""The Girl in the Fireplace"". [Spoiler Description](#s ""He pops in and out of a girl's life, constantly helping her from these mechanical monsters who are out to get her, and in the end we have that moment where he goes back one last time tragically too late, and it's done--even with a time machine, there are rules, and he can't break them."")

Maybe a rich benefactor could promise to promote his art or fund him or keep his legacy going, but it's never going to have that same impact in a world where *no one likes his paintings*. You can tell him all you want that he'll be famous one day, but the fact that the Doctor was able to actually show him how famous he is, how well-known, and how matter-of-fact it is for an art expert to talk about him as one of the giants of not only art, but of mankind, is something that you have to come to Doctor Who to see, because no one else can do it."")

They both produce fine entertainment, and if you don't like how Moffat's doing it now, there's the door. Same for every actor who has played The Doctor.

Denayer is not as good a defender as Otamendi.    That's a fact.  Does he have the potential to be?  Sure.  But he's not there yet.    

And having a youth system that supplies all your talent is a fantasy.  Barcelona have arguably the best youth system in the world.   Yet, Suarez?  Neymar?  The list goes on of players they buy at the expense of youth players not getting a shot.  Or even players like Pedro.   Even if you have the best youth system in the world you only get a tiny handful of players who come through.  The rest get sold on.  See Lopes.  Rekik.  Guidetti.  And 99% of all the lads in the academy now and in the future.

Lopes trained with the squad.  He played in the EDS system.  He played out on loan.  Everyone at City knows that player inside and out.  And let me tell you, as great a lad as he is, he is not good enough for City and probably doesn't have the potential to be.  So they sold him.  He isn't the first and won't be the last.  But kids will still flock to the system.   And City will still be buying the most expensive talent in the world.  Just like Chelsea and United.  Just like Barca and Real Madrid.

zzzzzz.... Last season when we were scoring a bunch of late goals people wouldnt stop going on about what great character we had in the side. Also surely having amongst the largest homegrown contingent in their side in the league would improve these characterisitics?

Regardless, I cant stand all this talk of character and leadership. The reason we havent had that many points this season is due to random variation in finishing. We have created better chances than our opponents in basically all of our games. Eventually, this will regress to the mean and we will see more points being accrued.

We aren't letting them come to Europe, so we aren't showing any compassion and that's the problem.

I occasionally do a bit of Street Photography but have a set of rules for myself.

First is don't ever make anyone look stupid. I don't take photos of children or teenagers. I don't take photos of anyone vulnerable ie homeless or distressed.

What I do look for is a story or more than just a simple portrait. So for example if I see a billboard with a huge T rex on, I might try to get a perspective so that the dinosaur appears to be towering over a pedestrian.

The issue with consent is that for properly done street photography..getting consent spoils the moment. As soon as the person knows they are being photographed they stand differently.

I understand your point of view and respect it. I've been on a photowalk with photographers who astonished me with their bad behaviour. Right in peoples faces with a wide angle lens.

However I look at the work of Garry Winnogrand or Ray Metzker and that's the reason I will defend 'responsible' street photography. It's important work.

Increasing your excess will usually bring the premium down a bit, but you'll have to pay more if you make a claim. It used to be that third party was cheaper than fully comp, but this isn't always the case now. Usually, but not always; worth checking both to be sure.

Price comparison sites like comparethemarket are fine, I've not found any difference between their quote and ones made directly with companies before.

Often insurance will be bundled with things like breakdown cover and legal cover. The value of these is up to you; but if paying £5 more gets you something that could cost much more yourself, I'd generally go for it.

I include my time driving on provisional when I apply, but be sure that it doesn't say 'UK Provisional'; if you had a foreign provisional, that probably wouldn't count towards it and could be used as a loophole if you end up making a claim, which could get the insurer out of paying.

Not sure what the effect of putting a non-UK provisional down would be.

Until I came to the conclusion that I didn't have one only because I wasn't actively building one myself.

Wing Backs will move up to where a Winger is places. But can you honestly see no difference in how Moreno played last season and how Coutinho played last weekend?

And even if the wingers have to defend in similar areas to the wingbacks, under a completely different formation how can you say it's the exact same notion. 

The width in a system with 4 at the back is completely different than that to 3 at the back in attack (especially counter attacks when we want to move the ball quickly). Having a winger and full back allows both to go wide, or one to cut insider. However being a wing back going wide is less of an option as evidenced last year by having the fewest amount of crosses. 

And even if Markovic and Ibe spent most of the time attacking, nothing substantial came from either. If anything Markovic ended up scoring more goals than Ibe (he has none for Liverpool). So if you are comparing the two based on their wingback role ad translate that to performances as a winger, why should Ibe be ahead of Markovic? His output has been worse in terms of basic stats but he ""looked more dangerous.""

The problem is soccer is a ""kid's sport"" until about the age of 15.  Serious competitive soccer doesn't really start until college (18-22).   Up until then, it's about teamwork and sportsmanship, rather than individual development.  We don't really get serious until our kids are the age of someone like Barkley or Pogba.  Which means it's way too late.

It's why US teams are always strong and in great shape but severely lack technical ability - we create amazing athletes but fail to refine their skills to compete at a higher level.  The only way we're gonna do that is if we start following the Euro model of having academies for kids at much younger ages, rather than waiting til they're 18 to start training them.

David Tennant is the worst Doctor.

I dislike Day of the Doctor

Big Finish is better than any era of Doctor Who

Paradigm Daleks were awesome and we would have seen much more interesting Dalek stories using them had the fan base not thrown a hissy fit over them.

Rings of Akhaten is one of the best New Who stories.

The BBC are the ones who have ruined Doctor Who's potential over the years and I wish it got transfered to Netflix.

The 13 episode over 13 weeks format does not work, a 6 episode, one every two months format with each episode being a '90-120 min special' would work really well.

A Sherlock / Doctor Who  crossover (even as a non canon comic relief episode) should never happen

Doctor Who does not need a new spin-off; if you want Doctor Who when there's not a current series airing there is countless books, Big Finish and Classic series to go through, if you've gone through all that and still want a spin-off then give me a call.

(Sort of counts;) Torchwood Miracle Day is the best Torchwood series. It trumps most Doctor Who episodes for me.

I would only be upset if Doctor Who got cancelled if it were left on a cliffhanger.

I like Kill the Moon

I didn't hate Forest of the Night

I dislike Rose and Donna

John Simms' Master was terrible.

The Daleks are not overused and are usually the better episodes of each series.

Paul McGann is the best Doctor

Series 8 is the only new-who series without an episode I hate.

Tom Baker has very few stand out stories in relation to how many he did (still a fantastic Doctor though)

K9 is annoying

The Sarah Jane Adventures are actually not that bad viewing (I'm 22 for context).

Strax is overated and needs a Strax v Sontaran Empire episode to be redeemable in this fact.

I can see how you might take that personally, but don't. I don't think I've said anything uncivil (such as ""go fuck yourself""), and you need to be able to have your opinions be praised and torn apart. I am happy to remain civil, but I'm going to vehemently disagree with something I find flat out wrong, which I do with most of your posts on this thread.

Now, back to the subject at hand. I hate when people do this, but it's easier:

&gt;Wing Backs will move up to where a Winger is places. But can you honestly see no difference in how Moreno played last season and how Coutinho played last weekend?

Coutinho is not a winger. He is a great example for how players that may ""line up"" on the outside do not have to play there in the slightest. I would say there is little difference between the way Moreno played last year and Ibe has played in these first three games. The only difference is that Ibe will take players on, as that is a strength of his. Moreno was (supposed to be) a better crosser, so he put the ball in the box from wide a lot more. Both are traditional duties of a winger.

&gt;And even if the wingers have to defend in similar areas to the wingbacks, under a completely different formation how can you say it's the exact same notion. 

It isn't the *exact* same notion. If I claimed it was exactly the same, I retract that. But the language you use is ""completely different,"" which is flat out absurd. As a fullback or wingback, you may have to deal with aerial duals, which is something you will nearly never do as a winger. Other than that, I'm not sure what's so different? Fullbacks/WBs defend the byline a bit more, but it's not a whole lot different to defending the sideline. The key here is that Liverpool's wingers have to drop in and cover for fullbacks consistently. Moreno/Gomez/Clyne/Johnson/anyone all got forward a lot and were out of position for defending. Our wingers and midfielders often drop in and play as fullbacks temporarily.

&gt;The width in a system with 4 at the back is completely different than that to 3 at the back in attack

Again, I find this very wrong to begin with, and then I find it extremely wrong that you use the modifier ""completely."" Also, how does having the fewest number of crosses possibly mean the wing backs went wide less? Markovic and Ibe are not crossers, and they wouldn't cross the ball no matter where they played. That's faulty correlation.

&gt;And even if Markovic and Ibe spent most of the time attacking, nothing substantial came from either. If anything Markovic ended up scoring more goals than Ibe (he has none for Liverpool). So if you are comparing the two based on their wingback role ad translate that to performances as a winger, why should Ibe be ahead of Markovic? His output has been worse in terms of basic stats but he ""looked more dangerous."" 

I guess I find this extremely simplistic, and not relevant to the topic. I am arguing that winger and wing back are very similar positions. You seem to be arguing that Markovic is better than Ibe? I don't think I'd be interested in that argument, though I think they are very close. Also, wingers really shouldn't be judged on goals. There are so few goal scoring wingers in the world that it's like judging a striker on how many hat trick they get each year.",null,0,null,1440777370,null,null,false,0,cuiqbqu,null,t3_3inery,null,null,null,t1_cuipqe5,null,null,null,1441550476,null,1,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

- John Simm was a fun Master, but he didn't really improve the character from his last few appearances (the TV movie, Survival).

- Clara is a much better companion than she gets credit for. Not Romana II great, but SJS/Ace great. Same goes for Martha Jones, who was given the worst possible conclusion for the best RTD-era companion.

- While I love the idea of a Time Lady with her own show, I'm still struggling with the idea of it being the Doctor (despite how great it could be). I would fully support, however, a Canadian Doctor.

- Maybe not unpopular, but Big Finish should be made canon ASAP (or at least the 8th Doctor stuff) and they should stop writing TV episodes that contradict some of them. Nicky Briggs should be the only one who writes Dalek episodes.

I'm not hugely into Golden Ales myself! I much prefer malts to hops but they are massively popular and for a small brewery trying to establish a place in the market we decided we should start with something that's got wide demand. I think it's that it's a sort of gateway ale for people coming from lager, loads more flavours than a pint of the fizzy stuff but still crisp and light enough that it's very drinkable.  
I'd take a deep malty ale any day of the week but for many it's too big a change and one thing we don't want is to narrow our appeal right at the start.  
A crowd pleaser that will shift in volume lets us produce smaller more exciting brews (in theory at least!).
  

&gt;Some thing I like a lot and haven't really had anywhere else is Badger's Golden Glory. I've never had an ale that peachy, it shocked me. Maybe a beer kind of like that, not overly hoppy but very fruity.

There was little-to-no subtlety in the way he depicted the character, especially when preceded by Eccleston as Nine and with Matt Smith as Eleven following him. The only companion whose relationship with the Doctor felt entirely natural was Donna - the fawning that Rose and especially Martha did felt very forced. And to top it all off, there were a lot of times when he was on-screen where I could actually see him take a mental step back and start fanboying the Doctor, *while he was playing the Doctor*, and it just completely broke the character for me. 

The thing that's really frustrating about it is that David Tennant *can* be subtle, he *can* be nuanced (seriously, watch Blackpool, you'll see it) and he made the active decision not to employ that ability when portraying the character that inspired him to become an actor in the first place.

We're still clearing out the extra players from the championship. And we have about 30 mil in strikers sitting on the injury table. FFP doesn't allow us to bring in too many.

If we look at your 3 examples, Mirallas is far too expensive to get him from Everton. No way they'd sell to us and we'd have to overpay him to go to a club that is at best a side step. Yilmaz? no idea about him. Ayew was apparently given like a 4mil+ signing bonus and that's money Swansea have after selling Bony to City. Their squad is also far more streamlined than ours.

If Ade is a loan, I think it makes sense. He's a similar physical threat that Sakho and Carroll bring and therefore might be able to switch in and out of the team easier than Zarate can. Also he can get onto balls if he's trying to, perfect for Payet.

And on Payet, they're went out and got the best chance creator in Europe and they're paying him to want to come here. Sure, OM? are in a bit of a mess but it's not like he took a pay cut to come here. And he's 28. He has no sell on value. 

So when you talk about them not wanting to spend money, what money? EPL has spending rules and we can't break them. I don't think there is much money to spend. ANd remember, and shit we already spent 10 mil on a fucking defender. 

and if we look at Stoke, it's an awkward comparison. Sure, they're a smaller club than us but they're also far more stable.

null,null,bzmbolekwa,1972crest,,null,"I personally think it's a bit of a pipe dream, atleast for a while. The big example for academy players is United who have had teams littered with academy grads for a long time.  

Of the other title winners since the prem's inception, the only teams who had academy grads who contributed heavily are Chelsea and Arsenal. Arsenal have had guys like Adams, Fabregas, Parlour and Keown (might be missing a few but these are the large players) Other than these guys its been bought talent both foreign and domestic. Chelsea have had Terry for a while but many other graduates have suffered from their purchasing history. 

The main theme between United and Arsenal that I believe has allowed them to utilize so many grads is stability both in management and philosophy. United were all out attack, never die attitude and SAF; Arsenal were possession based attacks with alot of flair, steel (see all their english players ever) and Arsene. This stability in the club allows for the academy to breed players for a certain mold and makes it easier for grads to become fixtures. 

In addition look at Ajax and Barca, two teams who have arguably two of the best academies historically. They both play a system that is the clubs system...top to bottom Barca play tiki taka and Ajax has long played the 4-3-3.

For City to have players come through the rank and be fixtures they need some stability and they need a brand. They need a style of play that  is City's no matter who our manager is. City wants to play this way or that way as a rule. It makes no sense for a new manager to come in and change style/personnel and us to believe academy players can compete with expectations and changes. We need to establish a brand of football we want to play no matter what. This will bring in managers who fit that philosophy (or vice versa, a manager brings a new philosophy that sticks) and this way all City players learn and play that style.

Until stability becomes apart of our hunt for domination, bought players will always take priority to grown players because the results need to be immediate.

&gt; A subsidy is a form of financial aid or support extended to an economic sector (or institution, business, or individual) generally with the aim of promoting economic and social policy.[1] Although commonly extended from Government, the term subsidy can relate to any type of support - for example from NGOs or implicit subsidies. Subsidies come in various forms including: direct (cash grants, interest-free loans) and indirect (tax breaks, insurance, low-interest loans, depreciation write-offs, rent rebates).[2][3]

Then on his death, the crown would pass to his younger sister, Princess Charlotte. 

If Charlotte was also gay, or otherwise had no kids, the crown would jump back a generation to Prince Harry (if still alive) and then go to his firstborn assuming he eventually settles down. If he died childless, the crown would pass on to a cadet branch of the family.

Now if we want to go full crusader kings, the way to do it is to set up a betrothal to George now (even if he has the homosexual trait, there's still a good chance of offspring) and then when him and your daughter have kids, set up a betrothal of their best daughter to your heir, and then you can get a strong claim on the throne in another generation which you can use as a caucus belli.

My first car was £300 and I drove it across the UK multiple times and over to Germany without any problems. When it got written off (thanks Vauxhall twat) it didn't matter, had no car for a year then my next car was £400. We are weirdly obsessed with debt for a new car, even if it isn't a good car.

For your next car, think about what you can actually afford: it might be cash, a lease, a loan, might be a mix of cash and loan, but whatever it is, ensure the payments are reasonable and proportionate. That £59 is 5% of your current monthly income, to have had it as an apprentice must have been more like 10-15% before any other costs are considered.

null,null,BenJoudarLFC,null,null,null,"&gt; Coutinho is not a winger. He is a great example for how players that may ""line up"" on the outside do not have to play there in the slightest.

He still plays on the left hand side of the pitch, especially when defending he helps/ed out Gomez by defending the left hand side of the pitch. I understand that's how he lined up but a modern day winger doesn't have to hug the touchline. When on the ball you can ask for different roles from your players who line up as a winger. Coutinho has clearly been told to start on the left but can freely move infield to allow room for his creative freedom. This then allows Gomez/Moreno to overlap him and create the width. A wingback will more often than not be asked to stay wide to help the width. 

Same deal with Firmino. Ibe and Firmino play in the exact same position but against Arsenal were asked to complete different tasks by playing a different role. That's down to Rodgers identifying someones stronger points and trying to take full advantage of that.

&gt;It isn't the exact same notion

The fact that there is a difference adds validity to my argument because part of the point I'm making is you cannot judge someones ability as a winger by how well they play as a wingback. Simplifying it to ""a winger rarely deals with aerial duels"" is far to basic. In a 3 at the back role, defending your corner will be done by your RCB, your RWB and a defensive midfielder who is coming across, usually that is. Having a CB and a RWB defend against a winger and a full back is different to having a RW and a RB defend against their counterpart. A CB is usually a lot less mobile than a RB/LB so Markovic and Ibe would have to adjust who tracks which runner based on that alone. Last season against Palace, Lovren was forced into 1v1s when they counter attacked us against Bolasie and a CB defending wide didn't and doesn't work well. The defensive line in place should then be one to support your CB defending wide as they aren't used to it. Especially if it's Can who isn't even a CB to begin with. 

&gt; Markovic and Ibe are not crossers, and they wouldn't cross the ball no matter where they played. That's faulty correlation.

How you can come to that conclusion considering both are wingers, without any proof whatsoever other than your opinion is ridiculous. 

Also I said the width in the 4 at the back system is different to 3 at the back, I think you're putting to much emphasis on the word different, but you also said you find it wrong to begin with. I explained why I thought that was the case, you just said you thought it was wrong and moved past it.

&gt; I guess I find this extremely simplistic, and not relevant to the topic.

Firstly I mentioned it was a basic stat, both players haven't shown a great deal for us and picking one over the other is basically 50/50 to me as well. But the whole thread was about Markovic and Ibe which is why I made that final comparison. Goals was just the easiest attacking stat I could find. 

&gt;  I'm not trying to be a dick to you.

If you're saving for a house in the near future, the absolute most sensible thing to do is to hold most of it as cash in savings/current accounts. You may look back in 5 years and wish you'd invested it in the stock market, but you may also look back in 5 years and kick yourself for losing a lot of money. I know which situation is worse than the other.

If you don't mind a little bit of leg work there are current accounts you can get for between 3-5% interest which can hold around 25-30k. On top of this, the government-backed help to buy ISA's will be launched at the end of this year, and whilst we don't know the full details of rates on offer, they do look like they'll be a pretty good investment if you're looking to buy a house before too long.

I used them for broadband and phone service. The phone service was something they were reselling from BT Wholesale, but it was not as advertised so we cancelled after a week.  
The broadband was okay for the first year but then uncompetitive (1MB/s when others offered 2MB or up-to-8MB).

Then about six months (might even have been a year) after we'd cancelled the contract and cleared the balance, they suddenly sent us threatening debt-collection letters.

They also made switching to another ISP needlessly difficult because they wouldn't release their [tag on the line](http://ask.ofcom.org.uk/help/internet-service/tagonline).

null,null,GingerSpencer,null,null,null,"The best thing about this thread is that we're currently doing what all potential employers are doing. Picking your CV apart. Little mistakes will get you thrown instantly into the ""Nope"" pile without consideration. Especially spelling/grammatical mistakes.

The first thing that jumps out is the colour. That's unnecessary. As is the format. Remove the colour, remove the table. Stick your name and address, email and phone number at the top of the page, centred. Remove your age, it's irrelevant.

Background information is okay, but it's very brief. Change it to ""About Me"" and fill it up with a bit more. Include your background, but also include what kind of person you are.

Take your Duke of Edinburgh award out of Education and add it to a new ""Personal Achievements"" category. Here, also add somethings that you're particularly proud of. Any projects that you put effort into completing that you were proud of that didn't necessarily get recognition. It's not as big headed as you think.

You can also remove ""and Qualifications"" from that category. It just needs to be ""Education"".

I would change your Work Experience a little, too. Beside each job title, explain what the job entailed. Then bullet point your personal duties. Most of the things you listed are actually what the job asks of you, rather than what you did. They want to see what you actually have experience in doing.

You could fill up your Personal Skills with a lot more stuff. I would imagine that you're not a complete dumbass, meaning there are a few things you can add here that will give the potential employer more reason to put you into the ""Maybe"" pile. Think about:

* Ability to use my initiative
* Able to work as part of a team or on my own as required
* Good at working under pressure
* Good at managing my time and prioritising tasks to meet deadlines
* Able to solve problems quickly and efficiently
* Can adapt to new environments and fit into new teams
* Willing to learn new things and new ways of doing things

You'll want to change ""Giving attention to details"" to ""Good attention to detail"". Also, instead of mentioning the programs you're good at, simply say ""Excellent knowledge of basic computer programs""

Don't be afraid to include more hobbies. Stay away from ""Going out on the lash"" though.

I hope that wasn't too nitpicky, but you need to be in a position where you'd pick up that CV and say ""Yeah, i'd give me a chance based on this"".

I ended up having to walk through Newcastle city centre by myself, often in the dark, to the stop to get home if I wanted to go home after the 6.30pm cut-off, or pay an astronomical sum to get on this one, as my bus pass was only for Stagecoach services.

Recall that he didn't know that he was artificial until later.  I am going to assume that he still derived energy from food or at the very least he still has the ability to eat and enjoy food even if he didn't need to otherwise he would have known something was up after existing for 1 day as an artificial.  Additionally, he would have had to at least form some friendships with the people around him (for example in the museum his coworkers) or it would draw attention because it would be strange.  From what we know, he was only in danger once - during the fire.  Amy's life was under threat 24-7.  She didn't really have any downtime at all.  Also, Rory would have, eventually, been able to listen to music, see other people, look at art, read, entertain himself, and a host of other things.

null,null,quinn_drummer,null,null,null,"It's far from ""light"" training, it's much much more than just pushing a button. It's knowing each train inside and out, it's knowing ever route and signal, it's dealing with ever technical problem that can arise. 

&gt; The first four weeks were spent doing theory, followed by 17 weeks of stock training – learning about the trains from the inside out. ""The trains on every line are different,"" says Jiles ""The Northern Line trains were introduced in 1995, Jubilee in 1997 and Bakerloo in 1972. You learn every inch of the trains – every switch, every mechanism, so if something goes wrong, you can fix it.""

&gt; Next came learning to drive the trains. Trainee operators can practise on a simulator (the public can try one out at the Transport Museum in London's Covent Garden), but because the underground system is so busy, there is no opportunity to learn by driving empty vehicles: you go straight from simulator to an in-service train complete with passengers, albeit with an instructor at your side. Jiles points out, with a smile, that the instructor can always press the red emergency button to stop the train if things go wrong.

&gt; Trainees have to learn all the signals, all the possible shunts – everything about the line they are working on. This is no mean feat: Golders Green, for example, has about 50 possible shunting positions. Driving lessons last for three months and each trainee has to complete a minimum of 100 hours before taking their test. Every part of the training is examined, and if the trainee fails, he or she goes back to scratch. The driving test alone lasts eight hours.

null,null,toby1248,null,null,null,"You can either do it with a Kraken G10 or with some zip ties. I used a Kraken for improved security. If you do that there will be much more hacksaw work though.

First, remove the stock cooler from the card. Keep the shroud and the blower fan, but put the heat sink to the side. Also keep the pads for all the VRMs etc. 

Saw off the piece of the G10 which holds the 92mm fan normally, and as much of the rest of it as you can without stopping the bracket from working. File the rough edges down to ensure no small pieces of metal can come off.

Use the instructions included with the Kraken G10 to mount your chosen CLC to the card (this will be fiddly). Alternatively, use the zip ties to SECURELY mount the CLC. You will have to make sure it is held on with a LOT of force and evenly from all four corners too. Linus has a video about this. Clip the ends of the zip ties to keep them out of the way of the shroud which we will mount. Make sure you have the pump block positioned so the tubes can come out of the top of the card.

Using a hacksaw, cut holes in the shroud where the tubes should emerge. Make sure you have these in the correct position as you can't undo this. Then, replace the shroud, cooling pads, and stock fan, making sure to plug the fan back into the header on the PCB. Remember, you need to plug the pump into a fan header on the motherboard too, so make sure you allow that wire space.

Finally, seal the space around where the tubes exit the shroud with plasticine, hot glue, electrical tape, or whatever you like. You don't have to do this if the gaps are small, but it will greatly improve the performance of the blower.",null,0,null,1440780860,null,null,false,0,cuisn6e,null,t3_3ipuh4,null,null,null,t1_cuirtid,null,null,null,1441551569,null,1,null,HardwareSwapUK,t5_2sp1c,1,null

I even admit i was kinda just a windowshopper type of fan for the most part before i picked southampton (I literally just picked Chelsea because I supported Belgium, and Courtois and Hazard were on the team, and I just love GK's, and not to mention, I LOVE BLUE.) So here I am now, sad that the Canuck's look like ass, and that Southampton are doing, thus far, really poorly as well. But I'm here for the long haul, I knew what I was signing up for, since this is more of a ""get player 2/3 years, sell them for a lot while signing cheap ass players or not splashing on a really good one."" It's going to be a wild ride from here, and I hope it doesn't make me sick since I can only bear so much failing. 

I just REALLY hope Clasie coming in will do somewhat good for us, and VVD rumors actually be true. While I think Yoshida is decent, he's mditable at best (where we are at, but...) we want to AND should improve, and VVD is where we should be trying. A striker too, since I don't rate Pelle that much. He can score, but he's dastardly slow, and not really a dribbler all that much. if JayRod can find the pre-injury form and Mane work on his finishing, we can be lethal going deeper, but as of now, we look uninspired. It's like Schneiderlin was the last line before we broke. Let's hope it's not the case.

Recently became a uni student and was free of the shackles of my parents who up until then wouldn't trust me with anything but a sim only rolling contract. Figured it was time for an upgrade and the most sensible option was to cash in on my years of loyalty and try to get a good deal with Orange. Foolishly I wandered into a High Street store where I was told that the best deal I could get was one that was displayed in the store, no loyalty bonuses whatsoever for upgrading and I could only open a new line because of some system fault. Naïvely I took their word, their phone and their deal. Went home with my new kit, phoned orange and told them I was cancelling. They offered me a far better deal, but that meant I'd have to send my phone I'd only just got back as its technically from another department. Again foolishly I declined as being 19 and an idiot with a new phone in his hand was too much of a draw than to save money.
Regardless, a few years later I discussed this with a buddy of mine, now a phone salesman, and he explained that basically what the guys in the store told me was more than likely a lie because they would reap a much higher commission from connecting a new line than upgrading an existing one. Needless to say ive now moved from Orange/EE.

I'd have thought all councils would regard that as fraudulent - they'll ask on the application forms where you are living to claim the benefit and, from what you have suggested in your post, you couldn't put down the rented house address because you're not living there despite paying rent for it. You're living at your parents home - for benefit purposes that is your residence.

The Council Tax situation is rather more confusing, based on this you'll be liable for 25% discount, so would have to pay because you're renting it and the house is not empty even if you are not necessarily living there as you suggest: https://www.gov.uk/council-tax/who-has-to-pay . Depending on location and council tax band etc this could become very pricey as it's solely you who needs to pay it, none of the students there need to. 

How long do you expect to be working with this situation?, I'd suggest that you perhaps might struggle if you're just on a part-time income paying rent on a house you're not living in plus council tax. Ideally you'd have the part-time job nearer the rented house so you could then live there and claim all the benefits and exemptions etc. It's somewhat far more detrimental keeping your part-time job and staying at home (even if that is rent free) if you're paying rent and have a stake and responsibilities in a property elsewhere.",null,0,null,1440782907,null,null,false,0,cuiu0ap,null,t3_3iqtvy,null,null,null,t3_3iqtvy,null,null,null,1441552212,null,2,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

Look at the panic United had when they finished seventh. They HAD to finish fourth last year or else they would have really struggled to get back in it. 

Likewise if we finish fourth once it doesn't give us enough to then start buying the players the teams above us are buying. We have to finish there consistently. We will not do that while we're building the new stadium, that's a fact. 

One way for us to do that is for one of the teams above us to lose CL for multiple years, losing a significant income and way to lure players in. 

Then, when we're in the new stadium and can make a real go of finishing fourth, we'll have a far better chance of getting there and staying there.

I highly doubt it. 

We have security cameras in my government building controlled by a central CCTV room at the local council offices. Management have no access whatsoever unless an incident occurs that requires a police response. And even then, they are only allowed to view the relevant incident; they are not allowed to use the CCTV to keep checks on staff. 

With a third party in charge of this equipment you can bet there will be data protection policies in place to make sure that access is only given when required, and only to the appropriate people. If they didn't, they would be in a lot of trouble.

Your bosses won't have access to any data unless an incident occurs. And even then, they should only have access to your data during the time window of an incident.

If they do abuse this they would be in a fuckton of trouble for breaching the data protection act and RIPA ([Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_Investigatory_Powers_Act_2000))

The idea is caring for everyone which is the basis of my views, no point in letting people suffer due to problems that people cannot control -- but the realistic and sad fact is you cannot support everyone, especially in a world that is so globalised now.

He says the problem doesn't lie with the immigrants, he's kind of right on that but here's what I would propose to him: when you build more hospitals, school and houses and the immigration just keeps rising and rising...  how are you able to cope with the demand of migrants and the increasing number of them settling here?

Almost not worth responding to this, but nobody is attacking him for merely being in the same room as an antisemite.    (If you disagree, then show me an example.)  The closest I can think of is the criticism that he attends conferences which are run by, or which feature antisemites - but that's quite a bit more than merely being in the same room is it not?

BTW - before you respond with the other common pro-Corbyn memes:

* No, Corbyn is not being accused of anti-semitism for criticizing Israel.  

* Neither is he being accused of anti-semitism for criticizing Zionism.

* Neither is he even being accused of anti-semitism.  (At least, not commonly, and many of the critics I've read have been at pains to point out that they do not think that Corbyn is an antisemite.)

The allegations are specifically that he chose to associate with and befriend antisemites and holocaust deniers as part of his activism work.

null,null,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,null,"Your point re: Coutinho is that his play, as a winger (which he isn't and wasn't being asked to play as), is different than Moreno's last season as a fullback. You were using him as an example of a winger and trying to show how different it is to a wing back. But you chose someone who doesn't play as a winger and isn't asked to.

Any bit of difference alone doesn't mean comparison is worthless. Saying that an overweight person is likely to become obese makes sense. The defining properties of being obese are different to those of being overweight, but the basis of the two is still very similar. The same can be said for wing back and winger, yet you want to toss the entire performances of Markovic and Ibe as wing backs out the window. That makes no sense.

Re: crossing, the numbers show that neither Markovic or Ibe are players who will cross the ball. Ibe is harder to prove beyond his time at Liverpool, but he has made 0 crosses thus far this year and only made 0.3 last year. Similarly, Markovic made 0.2 crosses per game for Liverpool last year, and 0.4 at Benfica in the CL in 13-14 (WhoScored only has CL stats for Benfica). In the Europa League, Markovic made no crosses. Compare this to the following players, some of which are out-and-out wingers and some of which are puzzlingly still much higher in crossing numbers despite not being pure wingers:

* Navas - 1.7 (14-15 EPL)

* Ashley Young - 1.7

* Di Maria - 1.6

* Silva - 0.4

* Nasria - 0.8

Ibe and Markovic are not crossers, and that stat has no bearing on if they played more as wingers while at wing back.

I thought I had explained why the width at wing back and winger are basically the same, but I will do so again. With 3 at the back, the ball-side CB will shift over and basically operate as a fullback with the wing back ahead pressing hard and available to double the attacker. This is the same thing that the winger would be asked to do under BR, and what we have seen guys like Sterling do extremely effectively.

Those two quotes from me would illustrate that I think your comments are way off base, and I do. I'm sorry that you took them as insults.
