I also was struck by the image at the beginning of the program of a once-proud street now decrepit and looking rather rough - and, going by the program, occupied mainly by foreign languages. The impression given was of people coming from abroad having not much care or respect for the street they had moved into, or the culture they had come into. Not much attempt at integration. I would feel angry and resentful in that situation too, I think. It's easy to be sniffy when you don't live in that sort of area.

So it was interesting. Writing off anyone who supports UKIP as a loony racist is not the approach to the problem  - nor is it accurate. Why do people feel disillusioned? Is there a legitimate concern that UKIP comes the closest to offering an outlet for?",null,0,null,1424654759,null,0,1424656850,0,cotz6la,null,t3_2wt9rq,null,t1_cotz6la,null,t3_2wt9rq,null,null,null,1424745521,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

It's by far not the worst place to live, but it is very small (only 280.000 people living here). The next bigger place is Dublin, also with only 1.000.000 citizens. The city feels small and it has A LOT of abandoned houses which make it look quite ugly. There's not a lot to do, the cultural life is being praised a lot but the events are not that great in my opinion. In big parts it feels like a student city due to the two big universities here (Queen's and Ulster University).

The people are lovely. They are very welcoming and interested when they hear you're a foreigner (a lot of love for Americans!) and there's no shortage of pints coming in once you mingle a little.

As I said, it is okay. By far not my favorite place on earth and I don't think I'll miss it a whole lot once I'm gone. However, I'll always be happy to come back to visit for a couple of days.

&gt;

&gt;__Caen Hill Locks__ (pronounced ""Cane"" ) are a flight of [locks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_lock) on the [Kennet and Avon Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennet_and_Avon_Canal), between [Rowde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowde) and [Devizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devizes) in [Wiltshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiltshire) [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England).

&gt;The 29 locks have a rise of 237 feet in 2 miles (72 m in 3.2 km) or a 1 in 44 gradient. The locks come in three groups. The lower seven locks, Foxhangers Wharf Lock to Foxhangers Bridge Lock, are spread over 1.2 km. The next sixteen locks form a steep flight in a straight line up the hillside. Because of the steepness of the terrain, the [pounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_pound) between these locks are very short. As a result, 15 locks have unusually large sideways-extended pounds, to store the water needed to operate them. A final six locks take the canal into Devizes.  This flight of locks was engineer [John Rennie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rennie_(father\))'s solution to climbing the very steep hill, and was the last part of the 87 mile route of the canal to be completed. Whilst the locks were under construction a tramroad provided a link between the canal at Foxhangers to Devizes, the remains of which can be seen in the towpath arches in the road bridges over the canal.  A brickyard was dug to the south of the workings to manufacture the bricks for the lock chambers and this remained in commercial use until the middle of the 20th century.

&gt;Because a large volume of water is needed for the locks to operate, a back pump was installed at Foxhangers in 1996 capable of returning 32 million litres of water per day to the top of the flight, which is equivalent to one lockful every eleven minutes.

I'd go one step further and argue that that's been the case for decades now. See [this clip from the 1976 film Network](http://youtu.be/yuBe93FMiJc?t=19s), truly one of the most well-written films in history. It's just as true today as it was then, perhaps even more so. Seriously watch it all the way to the end - that film is littered with some absolutely amazing monologues like this.

To me, I see governments as effectively a trade union for an entire nation. They are the last line of defence between the hellscape of completely unregulated markets and the interests of the people. And seeing as how that line of defence seems to be slipping further every day, I'm not so optimistic for the future. How could I be?

The other spot is a complete toss up. Liverpool are on fire so they have a pretty good shot. United has a ton of talent, but they constantly look like shit. All they do now is hoof it up to Fellaini and try to play off of him. Southampton is the least talented, but they still haven't fallen off. If we can string together more than a few consecutive good performances, I would like our chances. Unfortunately, though, I don't see that happening. I see it going down like:

null,false,solo___dolo,null,null,null,"I am a Jewish Spurs fan, so I guess I'll chime in. In my opinion the word has transcended its meaning. It's not used in a derogative manner by us fans, whom I'm sure there is sizeable enough proportion of younger supporters who simply do not know where it came from. It rouses feelings of unity and fraternity amongst us when we shout Yids Yids Yids or call Kane a Yiddo chant Yid Army or whatever. I am absolutely not offended by its use in that manner and I am all over those chants at the ground, but the flip side is that you will get some cunt opposition fans who take the Jewish link too far (Chelsea, West Ham being the biggest offenders in this regard) and partake in shocking anti-Semitism. 

**My main issue is that we should not be pandering to those racist pathetic idiots. We won't change racist pathetic idiots by simply banning a word. Tottenham has a strong historical Jewish link and racist cunts will always try and find a way to expose that, Yid or no Yid**. I would rather stick two fingers up and say fuck them and be proud of something that can essentially be thought of as a positive part of our supporter identity. It promotes a sense of multiculturalism within the club and works to expose the ridiculousness of racism. It breeds an acceptance and pride for minorities in your supportership who have been discriminated against. It means that it doesn't matter who or whatever you are, we all support Spurs and that's what matters.


There are some fans, and people at board level, who oppose its usage and do not want it associated with the club and that is fair enough, I can see why they'd want it banned as its uncomfortable for some (especially those concerned with branding) and people do feel differently about these issues. But to me, us fans using 'Yid' and chanting it works to dispel the historically derogatory meaning of the word and blunt it, simultaneously bringing lots of Spurs fans together. I feel that to most football fans now, the word Yid has stronger connotations of 'Spurs fan' than 'horrible Jew' - to me, an example of positive language change.

And just as an aside, ISAs are pretty cruddy right about now, but you can only put X amount in a year. If you put nothing in, and then in 5 years time ISAs are good again, and you decide to max it, you'll start with the £6k odd earning interest. If you max it from now until then (or at least contribute) each year the interest you'll earn in 5 years will be on £25k-ish (if maxed.) More interest earned.

Note that I'm not blaming Stones in the slightest, he had a good game, particularly that one block. However, if he's not there, Jags clears that ball, no problem. On the second one, he couldn't jump high enough. Well, what do you want him to do, attach pogo sticks to his boots?  Also, Atsu got caught ball watching, and completely lost Cambiasso.

null,false,TwoLLamas1Sheep,null,null,null,"Your first point about tracking deep runners into the box is why we need lucas back sooner than later. He usually is the one who tracks the runners in behind our CB's when the ball is out wide, leaving one of the centerbacks relevant to that area of the pitch able to step up(only if needed) into the space that lucas vacated. 


It requires legs and positional awareness on the field defensively, which unfortunately is why I don't think Gerrard can perform that same role in a 3 back to anywhere close of the standard of lucas, or Can, when applicable.


You're right in that Can isn't quite up to scratch in terms of ball playing ability *yet*. However, he has the ability to drive forward with the ball into space from deep and put the other team's midfield/defense on their back foot. Unfortunately, we didn't see much of that today because Southampton are uncannily good at shutting down the space pretty much anywhere on the field and then turning most turnovers into a quick and intelligent attack. 



I think Rodgers knew that well and was happy to see them dictate the pace of the game and see how well they do holding on to the ball more. It worked today, but decisions like that are always a toss up and dependant on multiple variables. I think if we had gone a goal down, the possession numbers might have been more in our favor from taking the risk of potentially turning the ball over in dangerous areas to try to thread through their defense.

Probably not.  Certainly not if you hope to be a member of your party's front bench.

I don't imagine party politics is much different to office politics.  The people who want to get ahead will be scrupulously on-message at all times.  Sliding off-message is likely to make it unlikely you'll ever get a front bench post, even in opposition.

On top of that, you can probably only afford to go off message if you keep your nose clean; so your party's Whips' Office doesn't have anything on you.  It's worth remembering Tim Fortescue describing how the office of the Whip would get, 'a chap' out of trouble in terms of debt, or, **[""a scandal involving small boys""!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwkOWPauu_A)**.  Fortescue is quite clear on that, it's not out of sheer goodness.  It's because, in his own words, ""If we could get a chap out of trouble he'll do ask we ask forevermore.""

It hasn't been a secret since the seventies that the Whips maintain order as much by threats of blackmail as much as anything else.

Once you rule out MPs with cabinet roles, MPs with aspirations to high office and MPs on whom the whips' office have 'dirt', the rest can vote against their party with relative impunity.

But the idea that ex-foreign ministers could use their contact books to make connections between British and foreign businesses is actually their job. The point of an ambassador is to create relationships with businesses and of a foreign minister to make those connections to ambassadors. And if you're offering your 'contact book' and experience, why not get paid for it like you would in any other job? Especially as both have stated they were offering only information which was already public. 

Now, if they were to use their privileged position as MPs and ex-ministers with connections to change some laws or help certain businesses get a better chance at winning contracts than others in return for payment... that would be dodgy as fuck.

It does my head in.  For a start off we are Everton not Villa or any other team that's dropped off the map by constantly changing managers.  I also think a lot of the whingers are relatively new supporters and think we are a top 6 position club.  We aren't.   We over achieve when we get in those places.   If you look at our infrastructure, our money, our players compared to the other clubs our natural position is about 7th to 10th.  Some years we over achieve, some years like this one we under achieve but this year we aren't far off our natural position.   I am assuming people who complain also don't remember the years under moyes (and before) fighting relegation, being bottom at Christmas and finishing 17th etc.

Ibe is just... so impressive isn't he? I mean you almost rate that 2nd half performance pretty highly even if you divorced it from his attacking flair. He covered a lot of ground on the sideline, trakced back well, had good awareness and seems so strong on the ball. I'm honestly more excited about him at his current state, than I was about Sterling a year ago and that is saying a lot. 

Lallana is a bit of a concern to me... after hitting a vein of form he's been off the pace the last two games.

The court fees that they are talking in this case are 5% of money claims, when the claim is greater than 10,000.  The fee is capped at 10,000.  For example if you sue for an unpaid bill of 60,000, the fee would be 3,000.

It sounds like the fees are high but they are ultimately recoverable if you win (but you have to have money up front).

A joke of course, but the point really is that Europe, England and Cambridge are probably very different to what you might have experienced at home in the US.

The whole of the [UK would easily fit into Texas](http://files.the-group.net/library/centrica/client_upload/Image/Texas_UK_resized.jpg), yet the population is twice as large.  So everything is much smaller and more compact than in the US: cities, distances, roads, parking spaces, houses, etc.

At the same time, many cities are hundreds of years old (Cambridge centre is about 800 years old) so designed for people on foot or horses, not cars. 

In other words, as others have pointed out, cars and city centres are not very compatible. 

On the plus side, public transport is reasonably well developed here (and safe). So for example, no-one in their right mind would think of driving from Cambridge to Central London (about 60 miles) - the train is a much better option.

In short, if you live in Cambridge (particularly the city Centre), you might want to consider a bicycle rather than a car!

Maybe it's because we're all immigrants together!

Oddly enough my experiences of the Swedes has been rather underwhelming. Despite their insistance that they accept one and all I have encountered barriers which I can only attribute to not having a Scandinavian-sounding name. And when I speak to Swedes (in Swedish, no less) I get a decidedly frosty response when they realise I am not Swedish. It's quite bizarre: I guess I look slightly Nordic so they assume I am Swedish, yet my dreadful accent and poor grammar make it bleedin' obvious that I'm a foreigner.

Anyway, I can understand your reaction to an extent, though I would disagree with ""there's always a good reason."" Some people don't need a reason, they just *are*. It's possible that the Swedes I encounter have been badly treated by Brits (or those of other nationalities) in the past, but is that a reason for them to take it out on me?

I was unemployed for about 18 months. No reason was ever given for the many rejections I received, and I was frequently given a frosty response by Arbetsförmedlingen (the job centre) when I visited.

null,false,rytlejon,lfc68,,null,"This echoes something that Tomkins wrote about when Cissokho came in, about *bad* and *good* players. I think people tend to be way to decisive about changes and players and whatnot.

Look at players like Lallana, Allen, Lovren. We know there are good players somewhere in there, or that they, at least at one point, have been good players. They might never become that great player again, or they might need a couple of injury free months to get back in the game and be way better than they used to be. We simply don't know. What we do know is we can't have a squad of 11 players playing in three or four tournaments, so Rodgers needs to try to get them back in the team, give them some time on the pitch to see if they can get back in. Your first eleven won't be your ""first"" (they'll get tired and play worse) or your ""eleven"" (you'll pick up injuries) for long if you play them twice a week for months.

Now, same thing goes for formations. It's been way to easy to say ""well, this didn't work, let's try something else"". Formations are really just numbers. What matters is which players are on the pitch and what instructions they're given. This needs to change over the course of a season if we're to stay in the tournaments and the league, and things that seemingly aren't working might just need some time to settle. Because the formation, or rather, ""which players are on the pitch and what instructions they're given"", needs to change depending on the form of each particular player.

&gt;Aston Villa's new manager, Tim Sherwood, took charge of his first Premier League game on Saturday and the result put paid to early hope that we might have a miracle worker on our hands. Stoke City visited Villa Park and came from behind to take all three points thanks to a stoppage time Victor Moses penalty. And it had all started so brightly, too.

&gt;With that, Villa drop to 19th in the table. In this week's show Chris and Steve pick over the bones of the 2-1 home loss and try to find some positives in amongst the dirge. We preview next weekend's trip to Newcastle United and make some assumptions about Villa's short-term future.

The conservative party's rhetoric before coalition was borderline anti-gay, with a specific focus on family. People who vote conservative typically aren't pro-gay. The fact that they made a random u-turn makes it clear that someone else is pulling the strings, and it probably would have happened regardless of which party got the most votes. Even UKIP are now afraid of being seen as anti-gay - when they once weren't - why do you think that is? Where is all this political pressure coming from? Certainly not the people.

While Oscar doesn't do the flashy stuff of a Mata or a Coutinho that's not his game. He quietly orchestrates the game off the ball with his movement, shepherding defenders around, posing a constant threat. 

I'll admit that I'd like to see more by way of goals and assists from the young Brazillian but he does literally all of the hard work that nobody notices. What Fabregas does in terms of cutting teams open with passing, Oscar does with his movement. 

Take for example the Everton game where Oscar didn't start. We really struggled to break the team down and while the absence of Fabregas didn't help, what I noticed from up in the east stand was that the defence was so compact and flat. With Oscar running between the lines, pulling defenders out of position and quietly treading between on and offside positions, it doesn't take us 90+ minutes to score that goal which was more down to a fantastic strike rather than good build up play. 

This is all without mentioning how talented the kid is on the ball.

https://archive.org/details/AnalyseThatPat-OscarVBoltonhLeagueCup14-15Hd 

In Terms of the way Mourinho plays Oscar is brilliant and has been perfectly moulded by the manager to play that role. Yeah it's frustrating as a fan up in the stands or watching on TV to see a player with as much obvious talent as Oscar have a minimal input in goals and assists but he does so much more than that. 

Statistics make a liar of us all.

However, they both can carry stand-off nuclear weapons, which would make them a huge asset as a second strike aircraft when the majority of the air defences are already down. The Bear's shortest range nuclear missile is the KH-20 with a 240 mile range, however, if they have an KH-55's still in use, then they can have up to a 1,300 mile range. Both are more than enough to fire at important sites in the UK without having to enter UK airspace or get in range of any anti-aircraft missiles we have.

I also noted there was no signage saying they accepted it anywhere, overall seemed a missed opportunity as the staff clearly just needed the experience to make a 1p transaction to be familiar with how easy it is to accept.

I think all paedophilia is abhorrent. Yes, Rotherham was a case where a grooming gang, mainly Pakistani Muslims, committed a heinous crime. You act as though it has received no public acknowledgement or condemnation, based on the fact that (people that identified as) Muslim people happened to have committed the crime, which is utter bollocks. The story has received ample coverage by media outlets, rightfully so; if some media outlet chose not to relate done details about the faith group they identified with, its because that is **not objective information** and is thereby irrelevant. Does faith and race come into the equation when it's a court case? No... Because it is irrelevant!

You're focusing more on the faith than the crime; as though the crime is made worse by the fact that they identified as Muslim... *By doing that you're inadvertently creating shades of grey in nonsense crimes like paedophilia*. I couldn't give two fucks what shape their god was... They clearly don't do it correctly anyhow (an overriding message in all faith groups is 'do no harm').

This idea you have of:
&gt; (...) people (...) defend Muslims

is false, most of those defenders simply don't see the necessity to bring their faith into it, It's an irrelevant factor. If 10 white people rape a woman, does that mean all white men should apologise on their behalf?

Because they can make contacts and influence policy in order to get considerably MORE than 250K a year. Tony Blair for instance you think he would have made all those piles of money without introducing policies and doing favors to those who gave him jobs afterwards? Or do you think he ironed his suit typed up his CV and went for an interview?

&gt;In any case. It is an established fact that the more money one earns, the more competent one becomes. Anyone earning less than £50K/P.A. is basically a danger to himself and others.

Established by who? You may note that politics is a popularity contest and it is not based on competency, qualifications or experience.

You also forget the peter principle and also brown nosers and the vast majority of the civil service and government councillors. 
 
The chief of a local council for instance said I'm worth my £250K salary because I have to manage a lot of money. Private company bosses get paid £250K or more so should I. They forget that councils have captive consumers who have to pay at gun point. While Tesco I can choose not to go there.

The word yid was used negatively towards the fan base since the 1890's and was then turned on its head and worn as a badge of pride. There is a difference between Spurs fans using it in only a positive manner vs opposing fans **only** using it in a derogatory way. 

By taking on the word it weakens it's strength. Spurs fans (especially *Jewish* spurs fans) have every right to use the word, others do not. Do you see white people listen to black rappers calling themselves the N word and then think it's acceptable to call them the same? Of course not. Again it is not *quite* on that level but as I said above it is the same principle. 

Not to mention the chanting isn't exclusive to football, you do realise the fans were travelling through an area that has one of the largest communities of Hasadic Jews in Europe? They're not simply offending a fan base by doing this. It is intimidating, anti-semetic and simply not on for the people of that community. There are also reports of gas chamber and hitler chanting emerging on the very same train.

The author also doesn't seem to know whether he's attacking the ideas or the way their delivered, as when he talks about predistribution. He high-handedly dismisses Piketty (while getting out his ouija board and insisting that dead Labour leaders would've done the same) and the 'abstruse' arguments of the Labour leadership while conveniently ignoring that the ideas underpinning the works of Hayek and Friedman, at whose respective altars Thatcher worshipped, are no less abstruse. Clearly Thatcher had no problem finding inspiration in the works of political philosophy, so to suggest that Miliband's similar but opposite inspirations are make him unlike Thatcher is simply inaccurate. Clearly, then, his problem is with the delivery of these ideas - but then why invoke a discussion of academia at all? He seems to be under the impression that when the left look to academia - whether Marx, Foucault or Piketty - it's insular and elitist but when the right do it... Well, we don't know what he thinks because he ignores it entirely.

There was no social care offered, no help with benefits forms or anything like that. My dad was severely physically disabled and cognitively impaired, and I was too young to know how to get the support that we needed. We lived in poverty because neither of us knew how to deal with this overwhelmingly complex system. 

Then when the coalition government came in and the system was reformed, my weak, frail, cognitively impaired, virtually incontinent, dad - a 50-something in the body of a 90 year old - was classified as 'fit-to-work'. His benefits stopped, so housing benefit stopped, so he got into rent arrears, was issued an eviction notice. The stress of trying to deal with the situation caused another stroke - his fourth by this point. There is no way he would survive a fifth. Social services told us there is no help they can offer. It was a mess. 

The system is already too difficult, and making it this way only penalises the most vulnerable. False claimants will always have the time, energy and cognitive ability to work the system, so we need to stop trying to fight this tiny minority at the expense of the most needy.

Because of relative lack of popularity, Bitcoin is ill suited for exchanging large amounts of currency, especially for relatively less popular currencies like SGD.

Per http://bitcoinity.org/markets/anxbtc/GBP, you can buy about £13k worth of Bitcoin at £166/BTC (so 87 BTC), which is a 9% premium over the ""midmarket"" rate of around £152/BTC.

Per http://bitcoinity.org/markets/anxbtc/SGD, you can sell about 79 BTW bitcoin at 300 SGD/BTC, which is a 6% premium over the ""midmarket"" 319 SGD/BTC.

Just by doing those exchanges on 79 BTC (13114 GBP = 23700 SGD) you'd have lost ~4000 SGD vs the midmarket rate (where 13114 GBP = 27424 SGD). That's 13%. That's absolutely massive.

I wear everything other than the glove liners all year round. 

The Alpines are cool enough to keep my hands from getting too hot in the sun but have enough protection to keep my hands bone dry in the rain. 

The Prexport Passos are fantastic boots for what they are - I could walk around all day in them and not have sore feet. They are extremely waterproof - not had a single leak yet and have been riding them in rain, snow and sleet since November.

The real jewel in my list though is the LS2 helmet. This was bought having had a Shox Bullet helmet for my first lid (which is a damn good lid!), but commuting further I wanted a lid which was brightly coloured (low viz days etc) and had a flip-down sun visor. The LS2 fitted the bill and is made extremely well. I went for a Viking and a Viper helmet before the LS2 and both felt shoddy in build quality, so I sent each back and paid a slight premium and went LS2. Would never buy another helmet brand again!

1) If I don't do the job then someone else will, so I may as well take on an interesting and high paid job. Me not taking that job doesn't prove anything to anyone.

2) Much more nuanced, corporate law doesn't oppose my values. It is perfectly possible to get into practice helping businesses to avoid corrupt practices overseas (i.e. advising how to win business without bribery), or to specialise in renewable energy and do the contracts and financing for a solar power plant. 

Maybe I believe that legal aid should be widely available, that the human rights act is a good thing, that the EU is worth staying in (and the majority of lawyers do hold those three views), that taxation isn't too high, that state schools need to have increased funding, that private interests should be kept out of the NHS, that the Tories are economically incompetent (again, the views of a surprisingly large number of people in the City), that equality of opportunity is horribly lacking, and that we need to introduce proportional representation in Parliament. 

None of those views are essentially incompatible with a career in commercial law. Obviously, practice areas differ and someone doing leveraged buyouts or corporate tax is likely to be somewhat more right wing and/or amoral than someone doing renewable energy or international governance. But you can maybe see why being left wing and being a corporate lawyer are not automatically incompatible.


It's in the same way that you can be broadly right wing and still believe in human rights and access to justice, and therefore practice public/criminal/human rights law. Look at Ken Clarke and Dominic Grieve.

Let me know if you need more info / general gyaan etc. on options!

The option to buy shares usually has a strike price, i.e. the price you will pay to buy those shares, if and when, you decide to exercise the option. So you end up paying for two things, one is the option (you pay now) and the second is the actual shares (you pay when you exercise the option).

1. You only make money if the value of the shares later (when you exercise) is more than the market price of the shares by at least the price of the option. 

2. If the market price is not more than the strike price, you do not exercise and have lost the money you paid for the options.

Germany could cut off at 1945, France in 1789 etc saying ""before this there was a fundamentally different system in place"". But the UK judiciary can trace itself back far, far further... how many millions will be end up pardoning?

Do we also want to say it is ok to break an unjust law? Anti-sodomy laws were particuarly awful from today's perspective, but what about more boderline laws... who do we pardon?

We must accept that terrible things happened, and if we can make amends with those who are still alive then I am all for that. However, as much as I hate what happened I can't help but wonder the mess we will end up in if we start posthumously pardoning by the tens of thousands...",null,0,null,1424695974,null,0,false,0,coudyef,null,t3_2wv4wd,null,t1_coudyef,null,t3_2wv4wd,null,null,null,1424752720,null,94,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,94,null

Sadly, Atos Healthcare are still making decisions on some claimants' capability for work and they are deliberately stopping people's benefits when many are very obviously not fit for work. Only after a long and convoluted ""mandatory  reconsideration"" and appeals process does someone with an ounce of common sense look at the claim properly. At this point most claims for benefit are reawarded. A lot of people are left without any benefit whilst all of this is going on.

For future reference though, most local Citizen's Advice Bureaux can help with benefits issues. Although a lot of these have suffered funding cuts and are themselves struggling to make ends meet which impacts on how many people they can help.

If you are in social housing, a lot of social landlords now employ their own benefits advisers to help their own tenants.

Also, most local authorities have benefits advisers (although these too have faced a lot of cutbacks).

Finally, there maybe some local disability charities that your father can access. It sounds as though he should also be claiming disability benefits (read up on the Personal Independence Payment) in addition to the unemployment benefit he is getting (I'm assuming this will be ESA).

null,false,UnionJames,null,null,null,"My mum took her own life in a psychiatric ward. July last year my mum, the person who had raised 2 children singlehandedly and had been a rock to anyone who needed a little support became depressed. She stopped going out, stopped eating, would just lie in bed all day, barely able to speak for fear she would say something wrong. Any encouragement she would brush off. I lived 4 hours away and had begun visiting her every weekend I wasn't at work and would spend all my holiday and sick leave looking after her. The home treatment team was also checking in with her and recommended she be taken in when she admitted she was thinking about suicide. 

I was burnt out. I was in trouble at work for taking so much time, missing friends and constantly travelling, burning through money on fuel and car repairs... I was getting frustrated and angry and I'm ashamed to admit that I took some of that anger out on mum. I would physically push her out of the door when she needed to go somewhere and she begged me not to. I would shout at her when it took hours to convince her to eat a slice of toast. After 3 months I has lost all ability to sympathise with her so a mental health worker telling me that she could go somewhere to be looked after by people who knew what they were doing, who wouldn't make all the mistakes I had been making sounded like the perfect solution

If you ever find yourself in that situation. Tell that person to get the fuck out of your house. 

The hospital was the worst place for her. She was surrounded by people who scared her which made everything worse, was interviewed by a doctor maybe twice a month. And as bad a job as I might have done, at least I didn't starve her! I went to visit a few weeks after she had gone in and he was gaunt. I spoke angrily to the nurses but they calmed me down, convinced me this was necessary in order to convince her to eat on her own. Had I lived close enough to see all this happening things would have been different id have pounded on the hospital doors every day demanding to see her doctor but I was hours away and could only ring. Each time I was told my message had been passed on and no reply came back. I never even got a doctors name. I should have taken her out but I knew at the VERY least, she couldn't commit suicide. I couldn't watch her 24 hours a day but they could. It was why she was there in the first place. 

Then one day. She hung herself. I was told she had used her shoelaces by the hospital staff but it turned out that she had used a bag strap provided by the ward. What's worse is another family had been notified because the retarded staff couldn't even recognise which patient she was. As bad a carer as I was, I hadn't starved her, ignored her or let her MOTHER FUCKING KILL HERSELF. But I put her there and didn't immediately take her out when I smelled trouble so it's still my fault. If someone you know is suffering from depression the way she was don't make my mistake.

*Fail to prepare, prepare to fail* should be above every student's desk.

The amount you'll need to cover may seem insurmountable at first but take it bit by bit and you'll be at the end of it quicker than you think.

Study groups can be very helpful.  You remember and understand more of what you teach others.  A friend might be able to explain something hard in a simple way.  But stay on task, don't piss about.

Yeah it was just hellish :( it seems like they just automatically class everyone as 'fit to work' as a default, then only assess each case when it goes to an appeal. And that drives me crazy because those least emotionally and intellectually capable of initiating an appeal are sometimes the most desperately in need of help. It's a knife to my heart every time I read a story of Atos staff or Jobcentre staff being rewarded for every person, disabled or not, that they deny benefits to. 

Unfortunately he was a private tenant. His landlord was actually the company he worked for for 30 years solid before his first stroke. Though they were sympathetic to his situation, they are just a business at the end of the day. 

We did actually get help from a charity. When the council told us there was no form of support they could offer (unbelievable given my dad's condition and the fact that he was a single father to me and my sister, who is blind and autistic) they gave us details of an organisation who helped us with paper work for a few weeks, but that stopped abruptly when their funding was cut.

The system is ridiculously complex. I made a claim for ESA 10 weeks ago now, after spending the previous 6 months off sick from work (leading to the termination of my employment). I'm still not sure what's going on. I've made at least half a dozen calls to DWP/HMRC because to date I've had a similar amount of responses with reasons why I can get something but not something else. First they think I'm still employed, then I have too much income, then I have too much in savings. Then they don't have all the information, prompting me to call the jobcentre to ensure they've received the information I sent weeks ago, to which the response was, ""oh yes, it's here, we'll send it over right away.""

All the while I'm picking up doctor's notes until a decision is made, sending them in, only to get a letter telling me it's due to run out soon. I make a call, they confirm they've received it and will send it to the right department to deal with it.

I don't have a huge problem with making sense of the hoops that need jumping through, and I'm staying on top of things. I used to work in the sector a few years back, so I have a fair idea of how things work. But for those without that experience, those that struggle making sense of it all, the truly vulnerable people, those that are, as you put it, cognitively impaired and without anyone to help them... It must be an absolute nightmare.

I'm lucky I do have some savings to fall back on while things are being sorted out, but many people don't. It's not an exaggeration to say I've have more than a hundred sheets of paperwork through the door for this one claim, some of which have been in letters delivered on the same day, each contradicting the other.

As I understand it a populist party is one that appeals to the popular mood of a group of people, without having a well defined, core philosophy unique to that party; or will adopt policies without consideration of their core philosophy.

UKIP are often described as populist because their policies do not reflect a core ideology beyond the euro-sceptic, anti-establishment views shared by the majority of their members. The main criticism of this approach is that it is at best 'wish-washy' and at worst would promote political instability. 

Some also argue that populism makes it easy to corrupt the population, a good example being the Daily Mail newspaper, a traditionally populist publication. If a political party with a populist bent has influence on the media, then a sort of 'positive feedback loop' would be generated, leading to political oppression. Not a likely situation, but certainly one to avoid.  

There are, of course, some benefits of populist politics; people are more likely to feel a populist party would reflect their hopes and concerns, and it is an excellent way to win votes. UKIP have achieved a lot through the populist movement in terms of shear voting numbers, but that is really only one side of politics. The difficult part of populism will always be what comes next, will UKIP be effective in government if their policies only exist to win votes, rather than to run a country?

I must confess that the only reason there have ever been Bo3 finals at LANs I’ve administrated are time issues.

However, as DOOPZ pointed out so politely in his interview, if the final had been a Bo3 as had been originally planned before I found out I was allowed a Bo5 his team would have finally won a LAN.

&gt; Guidelines for the pharmaceutical treatment of depression vary across countries, and there is also great variation in prescribing behaviors among general practitioners and psychiatrists not only across countries, but also among individual practitioners in each country. Iceland has the highest level of consumption of antidepressants, followed by Denmark and Portugal (Figure 3.11.3). Part of the explanation for the high consumption in Iceland is that a much higher proportion of the population receives at least one prescription for an antidepressant each year. In 2008, almost 30% of women aged 65 and over had an antidepressant prescription in Iceland, compared with less than 15% in Norway (NOMESCO, 2010). But the intensity and duration of treatments also play a role in explaining variations across countries and trends over time. In all European countries for which data is available, the consumption of antidepressants has increased a lot over the past decade, by over 80% on average across EU member states. While some analysts interpret these findings as evidence of a growing prevalence of depression, this also reflects greater efforts to provide treatments to people suffering from severe depression and greater intensity of these treatments. This rise can also be explained by the extension of the set of indications of some antidepressants to milder forms of depression, generalised anxiety disorders or social phobia, which have raised issues in some countries about the appropriateness of such extensions of prescriptions.

The Church is taking action to change things within its ranks, and ensure that everyone is paid a living wage. But it cannot happen overnight. There is no single Church body under which all employees are employed, there are several institutions which all come under the CoE banner. Each has different needs and pressures.

Every single CoE school staff member, From the head teachers to the cleaners are paid a living wage. This is a success within the CoE. Clearly more needs to be done, but it is not as simple as one person making a simple decision. The fact that they consider one person not being paid a living wage an embarrassment shows how seriously they take their stance.

null,false,aikimiller,null,null,null,"As another ex-pat living in cambridge, here's my advice

Find somewhere temporary when you first get here, like a short term rental in a house share, or short term furnished flat (definitely furnished- I wouldn't bother shipping furniture right away, it takes time), don't try and find the perfect place right away, and don't commit to something long term right away- you don't have the experience of living here yet to know what it is you're looking for, and it's a lot easier to look for the right place when you've got a base of operations, and aren't rushed to find somewhere to just sleep.  Get here, spend a couple months figuring things out, and then worry about the long term- assuming you're coming for the long term- if this is only a temporary move, the trouble of shipping furniture or cars is definitely not worth it.

If that's £2000 a month, then you won't have trouble finding somewhere nice, you can get a decent place in the city for less than that easily.

Don't ship an American car over.  The steering wheel is on the wrong side, an SUV won't fit on half the roads here anyway, and it may not even be legal to drive here (more stringent safety and emissions regulations).  And then you have to worry about finding someone who knows how to work on it if it breaks down (which may or may not be a problem, depending on the make/model, and and you may have to have parts shipped from America).  Additionally, you don't need a car to get around here.  The public transport is good, the town is small enough to get around pretty easily, and more people bike than drive.  Even travelling around Europe is pretty easy to do without a car, most people prefer trains or flying to driving.  Get here, spend a few months figuring out if your lifestyle needs a car, and if you need one buy it here.

Cell phone plans are pretty simple here, your best bet is to pop into a CarPhone Warehouse when you arrive, and have a look around.  Your phones are probably locked, which means they won't accept a UK sim, but you can always ask when you get here.

Be aware that power mains here run on 220v, instead of 110v.  You can buy voltage converters, and socket adapters.  Voltage converters are expensive, and unnessary- it's cheaper to buy new appliances.  A socket adapter won't stop the higher voltage from frying your electronics though- anything with a built in converter should be fine, and it will specify what voltages it can deal with in fine print on the plug (e.g. that little box in the middle of your laptop plug is a voltage converter, they can handle either power supply without issue).  A desktop computer power supply probably has a switch you'll need to set to tell it what the incoming voltage is- not sure about a monitor or a television (televisions have all sorts of other cosiderations- including a £150 a year license fee for owning one which funds the BBC) .  Anything that has a motor, or generates heat (e.g. blenders, hair dryers, waffle irons, etc) will fry completely- don't bother packing it.  For the PS3, I'd suggest just buying a new power cord when you get here.  Phones you shouldn't need to worry about (if you can use them here).  DVDs are region locked, an American DVD won't play in a european player, and vice versa- play station games vary (I think), PC games there's no problem- but don't expect to play on American servers- ping is typically 200ms the times I've tried.

Bank Accounts are a giant faff.  Finances here are all address based- you need proof of address to get one, and you need a bank account to get an address.  HSBC has a special account for people relocating that gets around this, however their reputation for terrible customer service is well deserved.  American credit cards will work, if they're Visa or Mastercard- no one has ever heard of AmEx or Discovery here- however if you're using American cards, be prepared for some confused cashiers- the UK has been on Chip and Pin for years.",null,0,null,1424702074,null,0,1424703441,0,coug11u,null,t3_2wru0b,null,t1_coug11u,null,t3_2wru0b,null,null,null,1424754081,null,2,false,cambridge,t5_2qh8u,2,null

They lost because Yes to AV was one of the worst run political campaigns of all time. They fundamentally failed in their basic responsibilities and duties. They did not contact the majority of people, they had a minimal impact on those they did contact, and the majority of the public were entirely unconvinced as to the merits of the AV system. All this is laid out in this nice [report](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/research/microsites/epop/papers/Whiteley,_Clarke,_Sanders,_and_Stewart_-_Britain_Says_NO.pdf) A few choice quotes for you:

&gt;The tenor of reactions was particularly evident for the Yes campaign, with only 5 per cent describing the campaign as strong and 34 per cent saying it was weak. Similarly, 13 per cent or less
indicated the Yes effort was informative, positive and interesting, while 15 to 22 per cent said it was not informative, negative and boring. Overall, only 24 per cent designated one or more
positive words to describe the Yes campaign and 53 per cent used one or more negative words.

This is only morally wrong if he is drinking the same as everyone else. If he's drinking less, then why should he pay the same as everyone?

Wouldn't a better analogy be that tax avoiders are the guy who buys a cheaper drink for himself when it's his round so that he pays less than everyone else? Which is indeed kinda douchey, but doesn't really cost anyone any more.

In my dealings with him he has never offended me.

&gt;nope not all views are ""valid"" some are harmful and need to be called out. that doesn't mean you're not allowed to have them but there are always going to be consequences.

Only if those views are acted on in some way. If person X admits to taking part in marches or throwing bricks through windows then yeah, consequences. But given the context we're talking about a person who explains why he wants to vote a certain way when he gets asked, answers truthfully, then gets those answers suppressed under a stream of downvotes.

&gt;we're talking about downvotes on reddit, the single mildest form of disagreement physically possible

Yeah, but then I find it to be a terribly passive-aggressive way of shutting people up. That's my opinion though.

&gt;he literally says he's prejudiced against people from muslim countries and people from eastern european countries. 

I have my own prejudices. I'm prejudiced against the ""elites"" of the UK, the old etonians who are born into social positions. I'm prejudiced against people who use religion as an excuse to be bad to other people, but I accept religious people. I want to see a tolerant, accepting society but I will also accept that such a thing is a virtual impossibility. However I will compromise and say that yeah, you can believe that certain cultures and societies are wrong / harmful / whatever, but our society and laws mean that you should accept them for who they are. Break the law and you'll be guilty of a hate crime.

I'm not waiting for anything. I'm a humanitarian, and if life has taught me anything it's that I should try to be nice to people. Even if Rupert Murdoch should turn up on my doorstep bleeding from a head injury I would patch him up, give him a cup of tea and call an ambulance. I detest the man but it does not stop me from treating him like a decent human being.

And on that note it's only fair for me to assume that Joe would do the same. I may be naive (in fact I probably am) but I think that given my exchanges with Joe in the past he would do something similar when faced with that sort of example.

Depending on how they work the number of items in stock on the website might bear little to no resemblance to what is actually happening.  I don't know the specifics of size.co.uk, but it will depend on:

1. How often they update their web interface (we've been debating about updating it from every 15 minutes to every 5 minutes to avoid this problem from product listing pages, but tend to be almost live in the product pages and order pages).
2. Whether they get their stock information from a fulfilment company (ie they don't have any stock and are buying from other companies to fulfil your order) and the partner they work for don't update them frequently enough
3. Their systems in the backend don't update inventory that often (you could do it automatically as the 'pickers' take it off the shelf at the warehouse or it might just be updated as the stock goes into a parcel out of the door)
4. They pick from within store and the stores don't update often enough based on what goes through the tills

Stock is a big problem for retailers.  Order fulfilment rates are a great indicator for customer complaints and customer complaints are a great indicator for future orders.  Equally though, overstocking has massive costs with storage, wastage and inevitably reductions in prices to clear.

Exploiting unintended loopholes has the same effect as tax evasion. The government might expect a certain amount of revenue from, say, high street coffee shops.

Is this significant, or is this:

 - 2014: 1 suicide
 - 2015: 2 suicides

= 100% increase in suicides

... oh look it is exactly that.  

&gt; The rate for men rose to 22.1 per 100,000 men in 2013, from 18.9 in 2012, with 229 men killing themselves in 2013. This was the highest rate since 23.1 in 1988. The suicide rate for men has been rising from a historic low of 16.5 in 2010.

So thats:

 - 22.1 per 100,000 = 0.0221%
 - 18.9 per 100,000 = 0.0189%

In short: our base is 100,000 not 18.9; so just because 22.1/18.9 = 16.9% increase doesn't change the fact that it's actually only 3 more suicides per 100,000 or a 0.003% change -- which is surely reasonable to call random variation?

I am saying that pay may be a prerequisite of (a) attracting the best people, and (b) ensuring they are satisfied with their lot such that they stop grubbing around for additional income, which interferes with their actual job.

&gt;Personally, I think those who are purely motived by a high salary is probably the opposite of the sort of person I want running the country.

I did not say we would elect people **solely** motivated by a high salary. I said a high salary is likely a prerequisite of attracting the most competent and accomplished people. You can feel free to discriminate against them on the basis that you think they're amoral, ambitious and financially motivated and not vote for them. Under the present system we are not presented with the opportunity to vote for them at all, which is not an improvement, and even the career politicans we have instead spend half or more of their time trying to supplement their income.

There are two ways of having this discussion. The first of which is we assume that **as a general rule and not in every single example** people that are better at their jobs get paid more than people that are not as good at their jobs. In this scenario, people that are very good at their jobs can command higher pay, and the people that can command the highest pay are 'the best'.

The second way of having this discussion is for us to bang on about the disproportionate pay of banking executives and Premier League footballers vs. soldiers and nurses, which is not a discussion at all and not one I'm particularly interested in having, so if that's where this is heading, let's put a pin in it now.

The Government needs some people with the rather nebulous job description of 'politician', but it also needs people with very clearly defined roles - analysts, strategists, advisers, economists, geographers, scientists and lawyers.

My current ""routine"" is:

* Wash face with Simple Kind to Skin Cleansing Facial Wipes (I realize now that wipes shouldn't be an everyday thing) They just ran out this morning
* Apply Garnier PureActive Intensive Spot Purifying Toner
* Apply Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture spf15

I do this most evenings and some mornings, but I have been known to sleep with makeup on which is not ideal!

I also own the facial cleanser that is in the same line as the toner I listed, Garnier PureActive Intensive Deep Pore Unclogging Gel Wash, it got lost in the shower for a while behind shampoo bottles and I only just remembered I had it!

I have not yet consulted a doctor, would a GP suffice since I don't have chronic or cystic acne?

I have recently started a new diet, but a healthier one full of vegetables and grains and lean protein, and plenty of water. Maybe my skin is adjusting to this new change?

 - Make their salaries non-variable ... so they get significantly more than they do now as a salary, but less than they do now in salary+bonus.  On average: what difference would this make?  Same amount of money paid to them, they've just got less incentive to care about their employer's profit.

 - Keep their salaries as they are and the company keeps it instead.  For the banker-hating types, surely this is worse?  Income tax on the bonus is 45%; corporation tax on the bonus (if it were no longer paid) is 22%.  So the state gets more money, the more is paid in bonuses.

Or you could realise that remuneration is a market; the company wants to pay as little as possible.  The employee wants as much as possible.  While you might find it disgusting how much they pay their employees, that is none of our business.

What _is_ our business, is if we (via the state) are pouring money into these large financial companies in the form of bailouts, moral hazard, and quantative easing.... and we are.  But that is, again, nothing to do with bonuses.

There are plenty of other rewards, such as being in a position of power and influence. The feeling of public service is also a reward for some people. For example, I believe a lot of NHS workers feel that the reward of making a difference in someone's life is worth the lower pay one receives compared to the private sector.

I feel the same way about public office - the reward is that you gain a position of respect, power and public service - you gain the opportunity to make a positive difference to the lives of those you serve.

That need to serve and do right by your constituents/the country should be a driving force behind a politician. It is a requirement of the job - if you don't feel that it compensates you for your monetary loss then don't run for public office.

&gt;The Government needs some people with the rather nebulous job description of 'politician', but it also needs people with very clearly defined roles - analysts, strategists, advisers, economists, geographers, scientists and lawyers.

Yes, but none of those roles need to be filled by MPs - that is what the civil service and government advisory is for.

EDIT: seems you added to your post while I replied..

&gt;I did not assert that pay is the only measure of determining a candidate's suitability. I am saying that pay may be a prerequisite of (a) attracting the best people, and (b) ensuring they are satisfied with their lot such that they stop grubbing around for additional income, which interferes with their actual job.

This is what it all comes down to. However, how do you set this amount? I don't believe you can entirely remove corruption - some people will abuse their position no matter how much you pay them. If you pay the equivalent to the private sector then how do you gauge the amount? Private sector salaries are not exactly put in lookup tables for people to check in the way you could look at the pay bands in the NHS for example. You need to pay enough that most MPs won't be tempted, but not so much that the money couldn't have been spent elsewhere. The thing is, we already have an independent review board to decide this.. so what more do you want?

Also, what is the equivalent role in the private sector? - MPs come from all sectors. Some are career politicians and haven't worked anywhere else.

What is actually happening is certain big companies are taking giant gulps of water and bottling this piss, and then sending their bottles of piss to exotic places, so no government can take back their piss bottles. this is slowly leaving the stream drier and drier, so those who only took the smallest sip, can't even take that anymore.

* He's showing up to training the day after we played West Ham, a day where the first XI is probably being rested. He might be training with our first team squad players or even with the reserves. Is he being systematically frozen out, or is he perhaps in Poch's plans for the away leg at Fiorentina?
* He seems to show a positive outlook and calls for fans to ""stop hating"", a message he has laid out in more detail before as a response to negative crowd reactions at home earlier in the season.
* His outlandish designer attire and the Rolls Royce are a reminder that he is the highest earner at the club. He has widely been viewed as a mercenary that plays for a contract, does this fuel the flames of such allegations?
* Does #Chillingtime, #Chillmode suggest even further that he is complacently enjoying the last months of the season with the aim or hope of playing elsewhere in the summer?

null,false,Pure_Silver,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt;This is what it all comes down to. However, how do you set this amount?

A good place to start would probably be with the private sector. The pay of prestigious roles at the helm of large, publicly-listed companies (i.e., the top-level roles filled by the kind of high-flyers we'd like to think about recruiting) is usually available, even if only in general terms. We need to think about the kind of calibre of individual we would like to attract and what kind of recompense they might receive in the private sector, minus of course a discount for the feel-good factors you noted.

Averaging the private sector pay of each potential role (teacher, soldier, businessman, lawyer etc.) to reach an average pay would be one means of doing so. I certainly don't have the answers; the current system was instituted by people smarter than I with more than ten minutes' notice.

&gt;The thing is, we already have an independent review board to decide this.. so what more do you want?

We need to recognise that MPs and IPSA are constrained by fear of public outcry from complaining about their pay, and the high-flyers who are discouraged by the huge potential pay cut can likewise not complain for fear of scuppering any potential political career. We need to have a serious non-partisan discussion with the electorate about the unrealistic expectation of attracting the very, very best candidates with poor pay, and explaining with as little hyperbole as possible that better - and especially *more independent* - governance is better for everyone.

What constrains IPSA from raising MP's pay to a senior executive level (say £150k p.a.) is the knowledge that any politician involved would be unelectable thereafter. That's not because £150k is a ridiculous amount of money to pay someone taking on the kind of responsibility an MP bears - it's not - it's because it's a ridiculous amount of money compared to the average or lowest salary earned by their constituents. We need to realise that as long as we pay average or sub-average pay, we are increasing our chances of getting average or sub-average government in return.",null,0,null,1424709063,null,0,1424709339,0,coujif3,null,t3_2wv0dp,null,t1_coujif3,null,t1_coui27f,null,null,null,1424755754,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

Firstly the confusion arises because the same companies are involved in both activities. It was suggested that these two activities should be split into different corporate entities and the banks all cried and screamed and stamped their feet and an option to create Chinese walls in companies appeared and so that's the path that was taken. 

So within the high street banks there will still be some in the corporate structure whose responsibilities will straddle that divide and as they are the ones at the top we would expect their bonuses to be among the largest.

If we look back across the history of banking we see a great number of bubbles that inflate and then burst and although the types of collateral are different the process is the same. 

In the case of your ""public trying to buy houses that they couldn't afford"", those people were offered a perverse incentive, in the form of a cheap mortgage, to service the rapacious demands of the market for property-backed financial instruments.

These same banking institutions are still not effectively regulated and the individuals involved have, with the exception of a very few scapegoats, gone unpunished.

That figure is from a [report prepared for the City of London by Price Waterhouse Coopers.](http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/business/economic-research-and-information/research-publications/Documents/research-2012/Total_tax_Contribution_OnlineVersion_PDF.pdf) It estimated that the tax revenue generated in the year to 31 March 2012 was £63bn. So let's place that against the cost to the UK taxpayer of the 2008 bailout which was £500bn. 

So if we consider that an interest free loan by the public purse and also say that the tax revenue generated has been the same year on year since 2008, they'll have only just paid us back.

We're also one injury to Eriksen or Kane away from a lower mid table finish,given how shit we already look against crap teams. As usual, these are almost all problems that can be fixed next season but probably won't.

As such, I predict we get knocked out of the EL on Thursday, badly, after fielding a weakened side. The League Cup final comes around a few days later and Chelsea take revenge on us. It'll be nice and close so our frustration is all the greater when they score the 3-2 against us in injury time (after we take the lead against them twice).

We then fuck up enough of the rest of our matches against mediocre competition and lose depressingly to City. Final standings:

3) Man U (The LVG effect)

4) Scum (because that's where they always finish)

5) Liverpool (doing pretty well, but won't overtake the other two)

6) Southampton (have enough of a lead ahead of us not to fuck up worse than us)

7) Us. Claiming we should never have hoped for top 4 anyway, except for the fact that we were one or two results against the likes of Leicester or Crystal Palace away from making it, as per usual. 

Still hoping for a surprise League Cup win which would be amazing, and that's as much optimism as I'll allow myself. Considering we have to score two in Florence with a team featuring Soldado and no Eriksen, I'd say Europa League can be written off.

I don't live in Wales anymore and I'm not really involved enough with nationalism to be of any use, but I know there will be a lot of people delighted to help you with this. If I were you I'd aim for the younger members of Cymdeithas yr Iaith (cartloads of which will be the offspring of the nationalists of the 60s) and then maybe seek out people like Ffred Ffransis and Dafydd Iwan.

Also, the Welsh music scene and it's influence on (+the influence had on it) by nationalist movements even up to this day is an aspect I personally would be interested in if I were doing this. Recommend the book ''Blerwytirhwng?' The Place of Welsh Pop Music'.

The amount of food it takes to raise an animal to slaughtering age is ridiculous. Fruit and veg would be far, far cheaper if we stopped feeding grain to animals and started growing fruit and veg instead, rather than leaving fields empty.

People can choose to eat less meat - virtually all modern meat eaters in a Western, consumerist society like ours eat meat every day which is just unprecedented in human history.

Now I feel more strongly towards the argument that the criminal justice system is *supposed* to work on the system of rehabilitation rather than retribution. The idea of the punishment is to ensure the punished don't do the thing they are being punished for again. From a moral perspective, if something is decriminalised  then it is because, as a society, we have decided that the thing that was considered wrong is no longer considered wrong. So from that perspective, continuing to punish someone to teach that person that doing the thing they did is wrong and they shouldn't do it, when we've collectively decided that actually it isn't wrong and they are free to do it if they wish is just plain moronic.

FSG doesn't want a situation where they pay him 100k now, then he expects to be paid 150k two years later, 200k another two years later, and 250k two years after that.

If Wayne Rooney played for us, do you think he is worth the 300k that United is paying him now, taking into account we don't have their resources?

Failing that, I'll sit in A&amp;E until the patient is accepted, as there is no reason why an A&amp;E cannot be a place of safety under the MHA. 

The only reason someone should be going to the cells under s136 is if their behaviour and risk of harm to themselves or others is so great that it cannot be managed any other way. 

&gt;As for one of your questions I already explained why they can't treat or evaluate mental illness when drunk.

Which brings another question. How drunk is too drunk? Some PoS suites use a breathaliser. Why? What's the acceptable level of alcohol, and which bit of legislation set that? What's the evidence to say this level is good, but crossing this threshold means there is no way to evaluate? Just because someone might be too drunk to drive a car doesn't mean that they can't hold a cogent conversation with an AMHP.

Isn't an alcoholic going through withdrawal a medical emergency anyway? If you're going to have to wait for them to sober up, isn't it better that it happens in a hospital than a cell?

The inconsistent approach to drink by the NHS psychiatric services is contrary to all common sense. Whilst it is obvious that someone blind drunk may present an evaluative challenge, that does not mean that they should be turfed out to come back when their sober, especially if the point of admission is by way of a s136 or equivalent, when they've presented at least some symptom that suggests to the poor sod dealing out on the street that this isn't *just* another drunk.

&gt;As for the cell, I was never treated as a criminal when in one anyway

But you were. It just so happens that the treatment of criminals is more civilised than people realise (and this is a good thing). You had a custody record opened, and a PNC entry was created. Your treatment whilst in custody was governed by the PACE codes of practice. Had you turned violent or started to self harm, police officers and staff would have used police powers to restrain you, using the same equipment used on any non-compliant prisoners.

The fact that there's worse places than a modern police custody suite to be detained (with tea and coffee on tap, three meals a day even if they come out of packet that doesn't need refrigeration, with staff who are often surprisingly sympathetic) is neither here nor there. The cells are a place of last resort, and there are very few circumstances where they can be justified. 

Furthermore, the courts have held that the CoP are not mere guidance, and they are pretty strong on the fact that the cells shouldn't be an automatic second choice just because a bed can't be sought.

&gt;So you've grilled me with questions even though I'm the messenger

It takes years to make incremental steps and involves reading a back catalogue of papers in the field as well. Discharging capacitors may well help you develop your skills as an experimentalist, but if what you need is to understand why the charge follows an exponential decay, then you really need to do the bookwork.

However, what is an established fact is that more money doesn't always lead to better performance. There's extensive research to demonstrate it, which is very easy to google.

They act like such laws are absolute, but pretty much anything will be circumvented if the powers that be decide that it benefits them. Likewise, if doing the right thing, doesn't benefit the powers that be, it won't be done. Judges will shrug lamely as the condemned is led away.

However, I've always maintained that Turing shouldn't have been pardoned.

Generally the law, both for private individuals and companies, is that ""everything is permitted except that which is explicitly prohibited"" i.e. they don't have to use a specific law not to give you a job, they just say no.  If you want to argue it you have to find a specific law that says them saying no is unlawful.

If you were married you might have a chance since being married is explicitly protected under discrimination law.  However AFAIK simply being in a relationship isn't protected.

Even if you were married there is a general exception that discrimination is legal where there is a genuine business reason for it - having both halves of a couple working similar roles *might* be considered a genuine business reason because of the organisational issues you mention.

In short, I don't think there's much in law either way, it'll come down to your employer's own policies and the views of whoever is making the decisions.

Has great parking and next to the train station as well as being next to mill road where all the best pubs and restaurants are. You could probably rent a whole house with your money but be careful the letting agencies are terrible people here. Also all of Cambridge is pretty safe. The crime rate is next to nothing here. 
2. SUV on tension road is doable but I would say use it rarely. Cycling here is so much more fun especially if your coming in summer. But a smaller car is best here just for the ancient and tiny road design. Also I have noticed SUV's just can't overtake a cycle here so your going to be stuck behind a cyclist on every road here. 
3. My friend works as a nurse at addenbrooks and they always need people so she might not find it difficult to find a job. Not too sure though as your wife is american so qualifications could be different.
4. I found couch surfing meetings to be the best thing for foreigners since they are hosted every Thursday and in a great location (changes every week). You won't stand out and everyone is quite open. Best thing is to add everyone on fb and just pick the people who you enjoy the most to hang out with privately. Though be prepared to be kinda bored for 3 months when you get here. Every american friend I have had this period where they met people but never made real friends until after 3 months. Also a great place to pick up tips like where to travel to and what to do. 
5. Most of my friends are foreigners (met via the cs meets) so I just tell everyone to walk into a 'three' mobile phone shop and ask for the unlimited data sim for £18 a month. It works well and has unlimited data. You have the option to cancel it any month you want. So when you leave it will be simple. Best thing is the data works in certain foreign countries with no restrictions just a two week limit I think. So it will actually work in the USA and most of Europe without a problem. Double check this though. Also virgin media is the best internet provider. Just go for the cheapest option and upgrade later if you find it limiting to have 20mb internet a month (its actually more than enough for two people). 



All my american friends love Cambridge. Its pleasant and easy to live in. You'll bump into interesting people and stanstead airport is a stones throw away.

There are surely loads of MPs who are cunts, but we want the ones who are hard working and dedicated. And we should reward them for it.

It must be fucking frustrating to have worked hard for this job, where you're cast as someone important and prestigious and respectable, and you know that everyone around you - all your peers - are earning more than you. You're opening a school, or meeting the local football team, meeting TV celebrities, and you know that they're earning 10x or 100x what you are. Why fucking bother?

The only reason MP pay is so low is that the papers shit-stir over their pay rises - in a way they don't over any other civil servants -  and pay rises are untenable under austerity.

This isn't a statement of fact. It is either your opinion, or someone else's opinion that you're presenting. It is not given that a patient cannot be evaluated whilst intoxicated, only that that initial evaluation might have to be treated with caution.

Someone having florid delusions might be as equally hard to evaluate, but that's no excuse.

Whilst I acknowledge that you're speaking from personal experience, you present it uncritically as fact, so I'm unclear if this is an opinion you've formed (which I'd like to influence because you've not been given the full facts) or someone else's opinion you're relaying, which I'd like to rebut.

My wife works with a lady who refuses to work extra hours because of benefits (basically she would end up earning only around £3/hour after benefits withdrawal). 

Other people modify their behaviour in order to claim benefits, e.g., registering as self-employed in order to earn the entitlement to tax credits.

If you look at worklessness in parts of inner London, it's up to 50%,  and there's good reason to believe that the benefits system is a big part of this - but Polish immigrants are able to found work immediately.

None of these people are 'benefits cheats', but if you had asked Clement Atlee or others involved with the establishment of the welfare state if it was within their vision, they would say no.

On the same basis, tax avoidance is not 'cheating', because it is legal, the same way it is legal for me to have two kids and go on benefits, rather than get a full-time job.

So it is simply nonsense, to equate people breaking the rules, and filing fraudulent claims, with people using the rules set by the government to minimise their tax burden. 

So the whole basis for this argument of £1.2 billion vs. £120 billion is just wrong.

Moreover, it is not true that the 100x more is being stolen by people whose wealth is huge - in fact a very substantial part of this tax gap is by people of limited means, small businesses, cash-in-hand traders and so on. Here are some figures:

* Shadow economy (cash-in-hand builders, etc.) - £40.3 billion
* Fraud &amp; crime profits - £6.3 billion
* CGT - £3.8 billion
* IHT -£6.6 billion
* Offshore abuse - £4.3 billion
* Error £2.9 billion
* Failure to take care - £4.3 billion
* Criminal tax attacks - £4.7 billion

The rest of the money, around £35 billion worth, is from avoidance schemes.

It's simply NOT the case, that this is nasty beastly big corps cheating the little man. Nope, EVERYONE is out to minimise their tax burden.

You may strike it lucky first time and get the right topical, you may have to try two or sometimes three prescriptions to get something both effective without unwanted effects: that is totally normal and does not mean your GP is useless!

Probably your first DIY change should be a gentle but effective cleanser: if you like foaming products either the Boots Simply Sensitive wash or Simple Kind To Skin Refreshing wash gel have decent ingredients.

Or you can go for a cleansing oil - a couple of the regulars who have breakouts rate the L'Oreal Paris Skin Perfection, I also like The Body Shop Chamomile or Nutriganics gel oil (ask for free samples first, and use a high percentage discount code/ voucher if you buy). These cleansing oils have emulsifiers so come clean with water, you should not be left with oily skin.

Those two are probably enough to get on with, stick with your current moisturiser/ sunscreen unless you hate it, just change one thing at a time.

Healthier diet brilliant! Make sure you meet or exceed all the healthy living guidelines because they give you the balance of nutrients you need. 'Eat a wide variety' is important, ditto oily fish, plain dairy, portion sizes (much smaller than you think for meat and dairy). Lean protein is good, but things like chicken breast and white fish are shockingly low in nutrients so be sure to have a variety - oily fish, other seafood such as molluscs, organ meats, seeds like pumpkin and chia are all loaded with nutrients.

Again grains are great but also consider beans and lentils, sweet potatoes to meet that variety guideline. Fruit and veg wise it is recommended to eat the rainbow (blue/ purple, dark green, red, yellow/ orange). Cheapest way to eat oily fish is canned.

We are dropping silly points, but they are because of things the manager can't mitigate for. Pre Xmas we were horrible, we set up wrong and subs were all over the place, but since the aneurysm in the Newcastle game, we have grown and grown. 

There are still problems though. We rely so much on McCarthy, so much so we could be seen as a 1 man team. Baines, Coleman, Jags, Stones, Lukaku, Mirallas (etc.) are all really important, but if one is missing we are usually fine. If Jim is out, then we go to shit. Bobby has to sort this out, and have a plan for when we are without him (and I feel Besic and Barkley is the answer... But Barkley needs to buck his ideas up).

so let me ask you, since we're on the vein of extrapolating data, if joao were at derby, would he score more/assist more? almost certainly yes. i would venture to say, with joao being on a team languishing in 20th position, joao is having an equally impressive spell. with suso out of the squad, he might be someone to consider, especially considering he's already on our books. I'm guessing he's the one that FSG/BR are looking at most closely right now because he could have an impact next year...all this ""he's competing with coutinho/lallana/sterling"" shit needs to stop. if the kid is good enough to keep on the squad, he's good enough. and from the matches i've watched, he's been near impossible to stop. 

the other point that i'd like to argue, is people keep sayikng he won'[t make it because he's 22...im sorry but really? matic was slogged off to benfica at 21/22 by chelsea and just needed game time. If this proves to be equally beneficial to joao as it was to someone like matic, we have an absolute gem on our hands. folks, i would watch his progression very closely, he missed the first half of his lfc caraeer because of back injuries, and has only played for a solid year and a half...i think his talent levels are extremely high, and his work rate seem to be good too. someone who is consistently dubbed the new deco deserves a look, at least, in my opinion, and i think he is one that rated VERY highly by BR",null,0,null,1424716360,null,0,false,0,counvsi,null,t3_2wvbtn,null,t1_counvsi,null,t1_couizbs,null,null,null,1424757835,null,18,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,18,null

Around 4-5 times as many men commit suicide compared to women.          

&gt;**Prof Louis Appleby, the chair of the National Suicide Prevention Advisory Group in England, said:** “Men are more at risk of suicide because they are more likely to drink heavily, use self-harm methods that are more often fatal and are reluctant to seek help.
“Fifteen years ago the rates among men under 35 were brought down sharply by tackling these problems and we need to use this success to address the problems of the new highest risk group, middle-aged men.
“We need to make it easier for men to find help without shame or stigma.”          

My issue is, we aren't told what the reasons are that drive the men to drink heavily and self-harm. This quote seems a diversion from the root causes and implies that blame lies with the men rather than their environment.       

I also have issue with the constant 'mental health is a stigma' quote. In my opinion, the constant use of this quote reinforces the existence the stigma and doesn't serve to diminish or make the stigmas absurd.

I think it only looks ""alright"" (as you've put it) because the darker blue doesn't transition as well into the photograph on the right. So here's another idea that might fix that: seeing as the sun is setting in the image, and also seeing as Oxford blue is nearly as dark as the night sky anyway, what if you tried to simulate the same blue colour-gradient the sky exhibits as the sun sets? You could do that by using Oxford blue on the left and letting it gradually sweep to the lighter blue (that you posted earlier) on the right as it fades into the photograph. 

If that's possible to do, I'd imagine it'd look pretty cool. As I'm sure you noticed, that's how the sun sets around here: whilst the sun is still visible you get an amber sky, followed by a light, dusky blue sky, which is followed in turn by a rich Oxford blue right before nightfall.

In theory, there's no need to do this.  Juries are able to acquit on what they perceive to be an unjust law. This is proper due process. A jury of 12 of your peers can accept that you have broken a law but can still acquit if they disagree with the law.

See the sidebar for details.,null,"If you believe in the concept of human rights at all - rights which are inalienable and to which everybody is entitled simply for being a human being - the right to life must surely be among them. Like all rights, it isn't universal; there is such a thing as lawful killing (say, in self defence). But that doesn't extend to organized, unnecessary and wilful execution by the state.

I also believe that the wrong done by killing an innocent person would far outweigh any benefit of the death penalty (of which I foresee few). Mistakes can be made in trials, and you can guarantee that at least one person loses their life due to a trial not reaching the right conclusion. However rare it is, this is not acceptable to me.

Therefore, I believe it is up to the supporters of capital punishment to justify their view - for me it is clear that the default position should be against. There are some fairly common arguments in favour:

Some people say you should only have the death penalty when there is *incontrovertible evidence*. I say that there is no such thing - of course there isn't - and the bar for a criminal conviction is already *beyond reasonable doubt*, the highest bar possible in pragmatic reality.

A large part of some people's views on the death penalty is based on a desire for revenge, which they often mix up with justice. This is a base, emotional and reactionary response to something horrible happening (such as being a victim to one of the horrible crimes typically associated with the death penalty). While understandable, the desire for vengeance does not have a place in our justice system. Justice is about preventing something from happening again and providing redress for victims. Killing the perpetrator is going too far in the latter.

Another argument in favour of the death penalty is that it is supposedly a deterrent. This is not possible to rigorously test, but there isn't much evidence to suggest that it would work as more of a deterrent than a life sentence - for example, [in ""Death Penalty States"" the murder rate is higher than in ""Non-Death Penalty States""](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/deterrence-states-without-death-penalty-have-had-consistently-lower-murder-rates#stateswithvwithout). Of course, there are more differences than just their attitude towards capital punishment. Death Penalty States probably also have higher poverty, looser gun laws, etc, which might push the murder rate higher despite the deterrence effect. So it's difficult to impossible to measure.

But I don't believe it is a deterrent anyway. People fear swift punishments soon after the crime, and they don't fear punishment if they don't believe they'll get caught. If you're committing a crime with a life sentence or the death penalty attached, you already don't think you're going to get caught.

So I am quite against the death penalty. I see no tangible benefit other than that it saves money (but executing people isn't cheap itself), and I don't think that is much justification anyway. Any attempt to justify it has always seemed hopeful or at best taking a casual attitude towards human life. There are a lot of downsides, but that's obvious.",null,0,null,1424719233,null,0,false,0,couppah,null,t3_2ww5w4,null,t1_couppah,null,t3_2ww5w4,null,null,null,1424758684,null,12,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,12,null
