I'll modify my point by saying mostly equal. I would however add that it isn't one sided in it's unfairness. The sexism goes both ways, because of *ancient* gender roles and their evolution and recent poor health. But it is more shitty on the women because we're transitioning from a past of harsh necessity/lack of alternatives as a species trying to take of the world. Having read long history, Humans naturally become patriarchal after agriculture pops up, because women need to do babies to keep the population from failing, and to expand the culture. And men have free time once they've done their bit in breeding, for hunting, farming, warfare, politics and shit. Women often got involved in the same things men did but lack of contraceptives put a damper on it. Last 150 years you get rising equality as humans have now conquered the planet! Martial-gender law is slowly being phased out in favour of a Brave New World. But Old habits die hard, and the culture is changing to adapt to the new cultural terrain. This difficulty in giving up the old habits are what you see in the Media.

The media is a potential fiction machine for whatever culture it leeches off, our culture is a post-modernist age of waning but still present sexism, racism etc. But we're getting better, we are trying and succeeding in small ways. Cultural change takes a long time, so demanding revolutionary change **NOW** is childish, instead contribute to the evolution.

If you look at things from a historical point of view you'll notice a downward trend for these sorts of sexist depictions as technology improves and the need for men to farm/fight for the progeny, and ladies to baby, decreases in the media, things where *a lot* worse, and pretending this is an issue unique to the now is folly. It is equally asinine to whine that we don't live in a sparkling Gender-Equal Utopia, which seems to be a lot of SJW's problems.

Is there a problem? Yes and No.

Yes there is a shitty problem, but No, it's not a growing tumour. Yes, Mr. Western Society, you do have a tumour, but the Chemo is working, it'll still make you feel like shit but it is shrinking. But it could come back, so constant vigilance to protect the growing equality for all is the price we pay.",null,0,null,1421805858,null,0,false,0,cnvlpk4,null,t3_2t38ii,null,t1_cnvlpk4,null,t1_cnvkew4,null,null,null,1424493988,null,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3,null

null,false,mrmunchkin62,num9-away,,null,"Our winger problem is probably the biggest issue. We dont have a whole lot of options. Mainly, this affects the entire dynamic of our front four. What I wouldnt like to see is what we played against Sunderland - a flat front four with little creativity that gets crowded out 9/10 times. With that being said I think our front four should be:


    Townsend-----Eriksen-----Rose
                    
                  Kane

The problem we had with our Sunderland game was that Soldado, Kane, and Eriksen (sometimes Chadli) all either occupied the same space or came in a lot. Townsend will give us a bit more width on the right and he's been pretty good the last two games. Rose isn't a winger but his pace might be huge, and more importantly he'll stretch the line. This combination of wingers should give Kane and Eriksen enough space to work their magic. If we're 2 up at the half, then I can see one or two subs being made (probably Adebayor/Lennon). If up by 3, I can see us putting in Onomah or something. This depends on how well individual players are doing, of course. 

A midfield of Stambouli and Dembele should provide enough cover for the back four and enough energy to hound down Sheffield's midfielders. Back four of Walker/Dier/Jan/Davies should do just fine if they keep their shit on lock. 

With all of that being said, I am very very worried that we will underestimate this team. They will come out playing their fiercest, and a languid first half (as we've seen so many times before) can be really detrimental for us. 

As fun as late winners are, I'd like for us to put em away as early as possible. COYS

I know UK has a higher living cost, but wages are also higher. For example, while the minimum wage in the UK is 900£ish, in Portugal it's 350£. I don't know about bills (gas, water, etc), but food seems to be relatively similar in price. I heard houses are quite expensive tho.

I know they'd want to interview me, and I'd be down for that. My idea was to leave Portugal with an interview set up. The problem is that I can't even find a job to apply for (and therefore hopefully getting an interview),

Regarding the type of jobs, ""waiters/bar staff/cleaners"" is kinda what I'm aiming for (since I probably won't be able to do anything besides that). I'm prepared and ready for such scenario. Like I said, all I want to do is being able to pay my rent and bills. So I can later take a personal training certification, and hopefully have a decently paying job.

null,false,lgf92,null,null,null,"The ""don't want to work"" thing is ridiculous. We have 1.96m people unemployed and only 0.93m claim government benefits, so the vast majority of the unemployed aren't just sitting around doing nothing. You can't really afford to do that in this country, even if you are receiving government assistance. 

If you worked 40 hours a week on £6.50 an hour, for 48 weeks a year (which isn't guaranteed - many employers will give you a ""zero hour contract"" where they aren't obliged to give you any hours at all), you stand to earn £12,480. £10,000 of that is tax-free, and the remainder is taxed at 20% or thereabouts plus 7-8% NIC (National Insurance Contributions). This gives you a post-tax income per year of around £11,500. I don't know how that compares to Portugal, and it's quite optimistic if you are paid hourly on the minimum wage to think you will work 40 hours each week.

In cheaper cities, a house share might set you back £250-300 a month plus bills - about £4,000 or £4,500 a year, I would say. If you wanted private accommodation, it will cost more. If you are willing to live outside of a city and commute in, or work in a small town, accommodation will be cheaper. As a student, I try to spend £30 a week on food, but inevitably end up spending more in incidental expenses.

The problem is that areas with cheap accommodation and living costs (north east of England, west of Scotland, northern Ireland) don't have much work, and have higher rates of unemployment. You need to think whether you actually have enough money to come here and live for a few months without finding a job - which might be £2000-£2500 or so. 

Summary: if you find a job, and don't mind living in somewhat rough conditions, it is doable. That first bit is a mightily large if though. You may well be competing with people who have degrees, not necessarily for menial work (although possibly...), but for any kind of office work or call centre work. 

For finding jobs, it would be a good idea to look on the gov.uk job search (type it into Google) - those are the so-called Jobcentre listings, which tend to be lower-skilled and temporary work.

*15 - OMG woul have been so great ic Gerrard would've got that goal.  Would have shut those Chelsea fucks up

*17 - Sadness :( but shit happens. We've played them off the pitch so far

*19 - Jesus really? ""Ole, Ole, Ole, Ole, Ole, Chelsea, Chelsea""  what an uncreative shit song. I do really like this back  3.

*21 - Gerrard is so much better in the forward advanced playmaker role.  His intelligence and experiance really shows

*30 - ""Diego, Diego, Diego"".  Is the Chelsea area of London really this uncreative and illiterate.

*32:30 - It's the lil' things like this that makes me love Coutinho.

*33 - No Fucking good if Hendo is injured   

*34 - Dirty fucking Costa

*45 - Hell Yeah Migs!!!

*51 - Costa is a piece of shit. 

*58 - Fuck yes, fuck yes!!!

*60 - He didn't even fucking touch him!!

*61 - Costa looks like he's in his mid 40's

*66 - Fuck! Gerrard has to get at least one goal this match

*62 - Hazard goes down easier than a shitty Bud Light

*72 - so decided that Gerrard desearved a red but this fucker does the same thing and gets nothing

*76 - definitely handled the ball past the line

*79 - thing Courtouis has proved why he's Belgiums #1 and Migs is second choice

*86 - Emre Jan pass vision is pretty damn good

*91 - Why has Brendon only used 1 sub

*91 - Wasn't a corner at all. Good call

They know how to use apps on their phone and how to browse the Internet, but that's about it. 

Think about it. We, in our 20's and early 30's, grew up in a time when computers and the Internet were booming. We mostly developed alongside those changes, learning as we went along. I'm sure we all spent ages downloading music from all sorts of websites, using Napster, Limewire and Kazaa and learning how to dodge BritneySpearsNaked.exe files. And here on reddit is mostly tech savvy people who use computers extensively in our professional and personal lives. 

But teens now don't have that experience. They have stable operating systems, abundant resources, video and audio streaming which is easy to access. They have apps on their phones which simplify complex things. In short, everything is much more user friendly and you don't need to be a geek to use a computer.

&gt;__Joseph Carey Merrick__ (5 August 1862 – 11 April 1890), sometimes incorrectly referred to as __John Merrick__, was an English man with severe deformities who was exhibited as a [human curiosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freak_show) named the __Elephant Man__. He became well known in London society after he went to live at the [London Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_London_Hospital). Merrick was born in [Leicester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester), [Leicestershire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicestershire) and began to develop abnormally during the first few years of his life. His skin appeared thick and lumpy, he developed an enlargement of his lips, and a bony lump grew on his forehead. One of his arms and both feet became enlarged and at some point during his childhood he fell and damaged his hip, resulting in permanent lameness. When he was 10, his mother died and his father soon remarried. Merrick left school at 13, and had difficulty finding employment. Rejected by his father and stepmother, he left home. In late 1879, aged 17, Merrick entered the Leicester Union [Workhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workhouse).

Its about recognising that no-one is born evil and people just wander onto bad paths for reasons that we should look to prevent. Membership of a belief system shouldn't be a crime, performing a crime should be a crime.  

Therefore if I think the only means for effective change should be an armed revolution with much bloodshed that shouldn't be a thought crime. It should be a crime should I try to actually do it.

GREEN TAX
Not sure if anyone really needs convincing that market interests haven't proved great for the environment, but global warming might actually start proving bad for business. [Here's what the World Resources Institute have to say about 2014 being the hottest ever year on record](http://www.wri.org/blog/2015/01/2014-record-breaking-heat-bad-business)

DRUGS AND BROTHELS
Well, lets look at where it's been legalised so we can see what chaos might await us:
""It's been a year since Colorado became the first U.S. state to legalize marijuana for recreational use, and CBC's Reg Sherren travelled to Denver to see how some $1 billion US in sales has impacted the state's capital....As more tourists are drawn to experience the city's marijuana culture, thousands of jobs have been created, including a cannabis critic for the local paper.

Police officers were worried when Amendment 64 first passed, a Denver police officer tells Sherren, but that fear turned out to be unfounded.

""We found there hasn't been much of a change of anything,"" he said. ""Basically, officers aren't seeing much of a change in how they do police work.""[Source](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/legalized-marijuana-what-colorado-looks-like-1-year-after-amendment-64-1.2918622)

""Colorado raked in $60 million in marijuana taxes and licensing fees in the past year, plus saved most if not all of the $145 million the Harvard report estimated it spent each year fighting marijuana

Most of the money goes into the state general fund. But voters dedicated the first $40 million in excise taxes annually to a statewide school construction fund, administered by the state Department of Education. So far, that  tax has generated $10 million for the fund.""[Source](
http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2015/jan/11/james-aubin/advocate-says-colorado-received-60-million-taxes-a/)

On the brothel front - correct me if I'm wrong - I think this is to reduce demand for human trafficking and sexual exploitation? You've all seen taken right? Liam nelson's an actor in real life, not really up to taking down the sorts of people the characters he fought were based on, so let's see what the National Crime Agency has to say on this one:

""Potential victims of trafficking exploited in brothels are more likely to be encountered by law enforcement than those exploited in private residences. Potential victims exploited in private residences may have less freedom of movement and law enforcement or other first responders may be unaware that the location is being used for sexual exploitation. As such, the true scale of sexual exploitation in private residences may be higher than suggested.""

The report also shows human trafficking is also being used in cannabis cultivation. I can hazard a guess that users would rather grow their own rather than run the risk of helping fund human trafficking if there was no fear of criminal persecution.[The report](http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/publications/15-ukhtc-strategic-assesssment-on-human-trafficking-in-2012/file)

ETON MESS
Currently being 'in academia' - good, [we're short on jobs here too](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/420234.article), and trust me (or don't) when I say that you want your researchers to be independent [because people can put as much blind faith in 'science' as an authority figure as anything else.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcvSNg0HZwk) 

THE BEYONCE TAX 
If rage against the machine's free gig in thanks for getting them to christmas number one so that Simon Cowell didn't despite the fact that Sony owned the rights to both Killing in the Name and Simon Coewell's company Syco, it's that superstar performances aren't really doing much good in the world. Band Aids are for covering small cuts, not feeding people.

Might also be controversial, but I'm also happy knowing my license fee funds some of the best educational documentaries in the world. I wouldn't mind seeing more David Attenborough and Brian Cox and less of whatever it is I skip past on the way to watch storage hunters now. 

I'm very worried on the other hand, that one one of those 'Foreign companies that control too much of the market'. is trying to tell us that [""the world is getting more dangerous""](http://news.sky.com/story/1404631/mi5-al-qaeda-plotting-new-massacre-in-britain). [When by all objective means, it's not.](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2014/12/the_world_is_not_falling_apart_the_trend_lines_reveal_an_increasingly_peaceful.html)   

DEATH OF DUTY FREE
Barely any of this section was about duty free, I'm pretty sure it's just there as a title people can relate to before they try to make renewable energy a bad thing because it means taxes, and regulations and all that boring red tape. He should really have mentioned in that green tax to be honest, seeing as thats what it is, but he probably needed to look like he'd found more things to criticise than he could find. 

THE NHS TAX
Sounds better than the insurance style system the people who will make money from selling insurance are trying to sell us.

VEGETARIANISM FOR ALL
Being vegetarian, I can't even pretend to be impartial on this one, so I'll let the tree hugging hippies over at [National Geographic](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/foodfeatures/feeding-9-billion/)
and the [Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations](http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/wsfs/docs/Issues_papers/HLEF2050_Global_Agriculture.pdf) field the question of food availability. 

SIGN UP TO AL-QAEDA
Much like Al-Qaeda, he's fear mongering here. [Only 2% of the terrorist attacks in Europe are religiously motivated. Turns out the rest of them are mostly carried by separatist groups.](http://thinkprogress.org/world/2015/01/08/3609796/islamist-terrorism-europe/) If the referendum in Scotland and recent polls on Europe are anything to go by, around half the country is sympathetic to separatist causes. I wouldn't want to compare UKIP policy to terrorists, so why should he try and link the Greens to Al-Qaeda? 


OPEN DOORS
While 'open doors' may not be the best approach at the moment, it's nice someone's finally got something different to say about immigration. Either way, globalisation's happening and it's not going the other way. If we want to stay relevant moving forward as the balance of power begins to shift East and South, we need to start doing things differently. Even the House of Lords say so in their report on [Power and Persuasion in the Modern World]( http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldselect/ldsoftpower/150/15002.htm)

Driving with very limited visibility (both front and side) he approaches that junction and with this limited visibility, he decides not to look properly, not to stop at that junction and then pulls out with only a few centimetres to spare before he hits the rear wheel and sends a human being into the tarmac.

That morning he decided that he didn't care about anyone else he could encounter during his drive. He made many conscious decisions to put himself and others in great danger.

I'm sure that there are people who can defend it, I'm ambivalent about it (and think it's mostly inofensive and an easy target) but I can defend page 3 existing in a national newspaper. It's that sex and sexuality, particularly men being attracted to women physically, aren't shameful or degrading things that should be hidden away and should take their place with extra large vegetable stories, cat stories, celebrity getting drunk and puking/wearing pants too tight stories and all the other crap that gets published in national newspapers, imo it's better and less harmful than 99% of the suns politics, current affairs and human interest stuff.  I think it would be a good idea to have more hunky men in it aswell.

Also, look at the language the people campaigning against it were using (from [this article on the anti page 3 campaign](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/11/page-3-women-rupert-murdoch))

He cannot hold up play, is emotionally volatile, is not very athletic, or creative, or even skilled enough on the ball to take defenders on. He's a player who can make quick runs but is not incredibly fast either.

Barry and McGeady aren't starters anymore, but having some depth isn't the worst thing in the world. Distin might be past it, but I don't say that as an insult; bloke's 37. Everyone has to hang up their boots at some point.

I don't think we have that many dead legs, to be honest. I've said before, I think Garbutt as left back and Baines on left wing would be great. Bainesy is clearly capable of doing it and Garbutt has proved himself a great heir to the Baines throne (though he does need time). As for the other youngsters? I'd say the reason they aren't being given starts is because it's believed they aren't good enough. On one hand? Fair enough. On the other, maybe throwing the youngsters in when the older lads aren't performing would give them experience to get better and the older boys something to compete against. 

I don't think we need a new manager, period. Between injuries and back room staff leaving (Alan Irvine sure as shit didn't make it as a manager, but at our academy he was clearly doing a good job), I don't necessarily think all of the blame can be thrown at Martinez's feet. We had one of the best defences in the league last season; how could he have known two players who were starting would suddenly begin showing their age? His tactics have definitely been off this season, and we absolutely need to be playing more like we were last season, but a change of manager isn't going to magically achieve some incredible result. And who would we get in replacement? Neil Lennon? 

Joel is doing a decent job for now; I say keep him as a challenger to Howard. I would like to get another goalkeeper in soon. I've heard there was interest from the MLS in Howard; if a big enough offer came through from one of those clubs, cashing in wouldn't be the worst idea. A lot of blame has been left with the goalkeeper, when, as I said above, our defence went from ridiculously good last season to surpassingly average or downright shit this season. Howard admittedly has made some serious mistakes, but the best keeper in the world isn't going to save a defence from being rubbish. Additionally, we all saw how good his form was last season and during the WC and thought that Martinez had finally fixed Howard's main problem: namely, that he's world class one day and fucking rubbish the next. Clearly he had a ridiculously good run of form last season and during the WC, and it made a lot of us who have been following the team for a while forget what deep down we always knew: he's inconsistent. 

I said in a post below, none of us know how the dressing room works. Jags probably should've stepped in the other day when Mirallas took the kick, but one mistake doesn't mean he's just not deserving of the captaincy anymore. But heck, like I said, if we had to give it to someone, McCarthy would be a good choice. I still don't think Jags deserves replacing yet. 

In addition, everyone can talk as much as they like about how we should've beat the fuck out of West Brom, but as I said before the match, they're a different beast under Pulis. He's a fucking good manager, and when he starts with a new team, his general rule is to play defensively and just deal with draws of nil all until he gets the team playing the way he likes them to. Remember, he's the manager who, when versing Liverpool last season (while they were chasing the fucking Premier League title no less) drew with them even though they were 3-0 up at one point.

Sky (and all other ISP's) should be offering parental control tools (though I know that when my parents ""used"" them, all but badly they were easy to get around) to censor the parts fo the 'net that they don't want their kids to see.

One more issue, **availability**. So, youv'e blocked porn from your home PC, well done. What about your **tablet** or your **kids mobile phone?**

I remember reading something years ago about a Mum who saw the ""filth"" her son was watching online, she tried to sue the porn company drectly. She was laughed at. I know her *intentions* were good however:

* She has **no** idea how to use a computer. (Okay, perhaps a bit strong there.)

Gerrard didn't have that many poor matches and is one of our top creators of goals from assists and scoring. Plus our captain so he gives the whole team a morale boost when needed which is shown in big games.

When johnson was picked we had not many other rb options so he rotated with manquillo and arguably his goal this season was a stimulus of our better form and confidence. 

Newcastle beat man city and chelsea they are no push overs. Villa are a defensive team and won via a defending error not sure how much you can blame BR for that. 

We aren't sure how much control Br has in transfers.  Maybe his target was better but not approved by the committee and sturridge has been injured most of this season adding to the lack of goals. 

Personally I don't think BR has been poor just fans have been impatient and unreasonable

From that you can estimate how it'd work out financially vs continuing to rent. Make sure to account for interest rate increases though, plus stamp duty and fees. The broker can advise what these would be. Make sure to get a broker who doesn't charge you a fee.

For the deposit, you may need a letter from the relative which states that it is a gift to you. That way the mortgage provider will be happy to use it as part of your deposit. You can then arrange repayment to the relative outside of the official mortgage terms and not tell the lender. Obviously factor in to your plan that this money needs to be paid back as well as your mortgage repayments.

I'd suggest to budget £100 per month for bills etc, and maybe another £100 per month to save aside for any big repairs such as if the boiler breaks.

&gt; Serie A is a more tactical league, not a more defensive league. The quality of full-backs in Italy is abysmal. They do not press as hard as in England

Just because they do not press as hard does not mean it's weaker defensively. I'd argue it's harder to score goals when the defense is organized and keeps it's shape. Organization and tactics are a part of defense. 

&gt; if you're saying wingers can have very productive seasons under Mourinho, then Willian should've had the same. But I'm guessing your comment is in reference to his first spell at the club, during which time we played a completely different system wherein our attack was heavily based on quick wingers counter-attacking.

That doesn't explain how Hazard had a productive season last year after he took over in the second half. That doesn't explain how Real Madrid's wingers had great season under Mourinho. Willian hasn't had proficient season because of what he does going forward, not Mourinho forcing him to do something. His role in the team doesn't force poor final passes, poor crosses and poor shooting. It also doesn't force him to not get by a defender and opt for the safe pass backwards the majority of the time.

&gt; The pace in England is also a lot higher and a lot of players struggle with it when they come over.

Have you even watched Cuadrado play or are you blindly defending Willian at this point? His strengths are literally pace and dribbling. He would have no problems getting past defenders. 

&gt; Shakhtar have actually beat Barca a lot of times over the last 15 years, and they came close to beating us in the CL too. So your comment is quite irrelevant.

Your other points were valid, but this one has no logic whatsoever. Just because Shakhtar have beaten or been competitive with big teams doesn't mean their league quality is good. By your logic, the Swiss league is as good as the PL because they beat a couple PL teams in the Champions League. The Russian league is much weaker and less competitive than the 
English and Italian sides no matter how you look at it. A couple of CL games don't mean shit, as any team can get on a great bit of form and beat the best teams.

Well, I can't advise you on that as it is subjective, but I would say:

* Calculate how it is likely to work out financially in both cases - and how much better off you expect to be by doing the two flat option.
* The two flat option needs to be clearly better financially if it means your living situation is worse (extra hassle from dealing with tenants, potentially worse flat for yourself vs only spending money on yours)
* In either case, make sure that you will be happy there for a long while. Remember it is a living decision and not just a financial investment.
* Consider any legal complexities - is the two flat place considered to be one property? Is it legal to rent one out as a separate flat? Maybe you can legally keep it as one residence but get a tenant in as a ""lodger"" of the whole thing with you, and then just agree with them that only the top part is accessible to them.
* It is reassuring to think that the place could be converted back into one bigger property if your needs change and you want to live in it all yourself, or let the whole thing out and move elsewhere yourself.

In summary, it is subjective but either could potentially be good options.

After that, I carried on until McCoy, and then can recall the chill that went down my spine when the Beeb ran the first trailer for the 1996 film (""He's back. And it's about time too."" No music, no nothing, I instantly knew what they meant!).

The Netherlands has a history of competing mutuals, something alien over here where national and international corporations tend to dominate. With regards to the payment by individuals, they have to join a ziekenfonds (health insurance fund) through payroll deductions... just like here. People are then reimbursed between 50% and 75% of the cost by their scheme. This has merit, but I have concerns regarding the domination of a sponsorship scheme by large multinationals who wouldn't give two fucks about the man on the clapham omnibus, instead only caring about their profit margins (which will never be great in healthcare). If we could implement a mutual scheme like in Belgium then it may just work... but socially we are a LONG way off this.

France is run similar to what is being proposed by the Tories (but some commentators doubt that the tories want to keep ANY state-run services), with a two-tier system. People swipe their card and pay for the treatment, with the state (CPAM) then reimbursing between 70% and 100% depending on type and point of treatment. I personally like this idea as it would allow us to control demand in certain sectors and routes, so for example we could effectively penalise people calling anambulance for minor complaints by lowering the reimbursement. Most people then also join a mutual (again, a rare thing in the UK) to top up this reimbursement to 100%. The downside here kids is that the costs of this system is high, not only in reimbursement but in bureaucracy and claims against reimbursement rate changes. As a system it has merits but I can't see how this can be implemented into our system without massively costly unravelling all the bullshit of ""GP Consortiums"" and CCGs.

Germany is perhaps the most market driven, as people can choose out of around 300 statutory state sickness funds for their payroll deduction to go through. Note 'state' funds: private ones exist and around 15% of the population opt out of the state funds for these, but oversight is much lower and returns are questionable for some (admittedly though the market then ends up penalising bad management). In Germany the person pays all the fees upfront and is then reimbursed, but because most people can never afford to do this there exist additional 'local sickness funds' to save the upfront payment with then complex reimbursement to two groups being required. All very inefficient. On top of this the insurance for accident and long-term care (Arbeitsunfallversicherung and Pflegeversicherung) is lumped into the health insurance by the fund, which has often been accused as lacking oversight and where hidden costs can be implemented without visibility or knowledge of returns. In addition to even this, the poor often are still priced out and so 1/3 of the population needs to use the state funded Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse - the fund of last resort. Their health system is managed locally like the pre-1974 NHS... so to go to the German system would again require the dismantling of nearly all the structural changes of the Tory government. Some would call this a good thing. 

**TL;DR** - France, Netherlands, Germany have some good points but also huge bad points, and there are good reasons we can't simply emulate their systems.

In mitigation to the above, I did find reference to the EU economic crisis on european healthcare... so I bet we're glad we dodged a bullet in the form of the Euro...

Everyone's in favour of defending speech they agree with, it's practically meaningless.

As a Christian and an Engineer, I’ve noticed this often stands out. There always seems to be more single women in churches then men, and a lot of the women there tend to work in social-care fields (nursing, psychologists, teachers, child-care workers, etc.). This was also true at University, where the ratio of women-to-men in the CU was about 3:2, and most of the women were studying for degrees in those fields.

At engineering conferences there is often debate around how to encourage more women into SEM fields (and few answers). Biology seems to be majority women at the moment, chemistry is more of an even-split, and physics (and engineering/maths/CS) is almost exclusively male. The ratio of women to men training as doctors is something like 3:2.

Are women more socially conscious, more caring then men? Or is this something to do with nurture, or the way that the environment we work and lean in tend to self-reinforce existing gender roles?

In the case of this school, the head is quoted as saying the issue wasn't educating about different faiths, which they did, but being forced to celebrate their holidays

&gt;In my town a conservative Evangelical Christian group tried to set up a Free School which would be allowed to select their own kids for admission. So the kids would be immersed in the same worldview at home, in their social life and at school. That can't be good for them.

That really depends on what the alternative is, doesn't it? If someone takes the stance that a formal religious education is inherently harmful then you'd have to have faith that the alternative isn't, and then it's really down to someone's view as to what a healthy upbringing constitutes. Personally I'd find that pretty hard to define. It certainly doesn't end at 'be excellent to each other'.

&gt;The value of an OFSTED inspection depends on the quality of the inspectors. Good inspectors who genuinely want to help the school improve will work round the absurdities and point out the real problems. Inspectors who treat an inspection as a rigid tick box exercise or who have an axe to grind are quite damaging.

You realise that if the same criteria were applied to the quality of local authority education, heads and teachers, there'd be no need for OFSTED? And then you'd be removing the real absurdity of scoring, league tables and the need to be 'performant' to be judged a success

I do see your point and agree that examples of relative success such as Jackson's character in Django don't change the fact that a system can be unjust and should be changed. However comparing slavery to page 3 is not accurate because of course the point about slavery is that if you were born a slave you had no choice but to continue being a slave. If you are born a woman you do not have to pose for page 3. The point is that for some women, it makes sense to do so.

It seems incontrovertible that there will always be a demand for pictures of attractive women, and in society there will always be some women whose 'comparative advantage' is their physical attractiveness. People vary widely, to put it crudely there are smart beautiful people, smart ugly people, dumb ugly people, dumb beautiful people and all shades in between. Similarly for some men, their comparative advantage may be in becoming a cage fighter, despite the crude, stereotypical picture of masculinity it presents.

What Modric offers is the potential to play an attacking 4-3-3 style where he'd replace Oscar and so it would be slightly more defensive but be able to dominate the midfield and move forward from there. He could replace Matic if Mourinho wanted to play a very attacking style in a similar vein to what Real do at the moment where there is no clear defensive mid but they dictate the attack heavily and pressure the opposition continually. He could also replace Fabregas and still offer some of the creativity which none of the current midfielders offer. The point would be that he wouldn't necessarily start every match but neither would Oscar, Fabregas or Matic, you'd rotate to whichever style you thought suited the match the best.

#Explanations, caveats and answers to common questions. 
**The level of unemployment is not calculated from the number of people on out-of-work benefits** so sanctions or the actions of job centres will not affect it. These figures are based on a survey called the Labour Force Survey which samples around 40-45 thousand people every quarter. There are unemployed who are not entitled to out-of-work benefits  (e.g. those with a large household income due to a spouse, those with large savings, or those on sanctions) and there are people who claim JSA but are not unemployed (e.g. those who work less than a certain number of hours or fraudsters), so the two are not the same. The number of people claiming out-of-work benefits is reported separately as the Claimant Count. (See above for those figures)

Zero-hour contracts are not regularly measured (they were measured once in Apr-Jun 2014 at 2% of employment or 1.0% of full time and 4.9% of part time), however there is some regular measure of “underemployment”  by measuring those who are in part-time work but wish to be in full-time work. People self-select whether they are full time or part time. Equally those on temporary contracts who wish to be permanent are counted. (See above for these figures)

The rate of unemployment is an economic measure of spare labour in the workforce not a political measure of how well a government is doing at making sure everyone is happy with their job situation. As such, those on workfare, government training programmes or unpaid internships are not counted as unemployed; they do not currently have spare labour to add to the economy. However those on “Government supported training &amp; employment programmes” are reported separately so you may recast the figures should you wish. (See above for these figures) 

The definition of unemployment requires someone to be actively seeking work in the last four weeks and able to start work in the next two weeks. Those who are out of work and say they want a job but don’t meet this definition are reported separately under Inactive. Note that the Inactive category is only for 16-64 year olds. (See above for these figures)

The figures are calculated by the independent Office of National Statistics based on internationally agreed conventions. The government cannot interfere with the calculation of the figures or set the way in which they are calculated. However knowing how the numbers are calculated does mean governments can set policy accordingly and create targets which may not be in the best interest of the public. 

The numbers are seasonally adjusted, so there should be no effect from things such as Christmas jobs.

Given that the numbers are based on a survey, the figures can never be perfectly accurate and there is a margin of error, e.g. the 95% confidence interval for the unemployment rates is ± 0.2%. The numbers should be seen as approximate and are best understood in terms of the trends they show over time.

Items highlighted with * have more recent data available, so I have used these data instead, and used the same offset for the historic columns to maintain comparability.

Have a read a [Big City Plan part 1](http://bigcityplan.birmingham.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Big-City-Plan-Part-1.pdf) and [Big city plan part 2](http://bigcityplan.birmingham.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Big-City-Plan-Part-2.pdf). The main areas of interest for you would be Southside and Highgate and Westside and Ladywood. Both areas are going to be officially part of the city centre and are the most likest areas to grow in value as HS2 comes nearer to completion. I would opt for highgate as its has the added advantage of being nearer to digbeth which is being heavily invested in as well as being closer to the HS2 hub. 

Both areas are set to be changed beyond recognition, especially Highgate. It has a bit of an accessibility issue in getting to it from the city centre (all those factories and huge roads in the way) which seems like is going to be sorted out. There is more details in the Part 2 of the big city plan.  

Currently with a brisk pace you can get to the planned HS2 terminal from Highgate in about 20minutes walk.

Setting up as a Ltd company is easy (I'm a contractor and have gone down this route), and is probably the most tax efficient way for you to go (speak to your new accountant :) )

Is your wife more organised than you? If so, ask her very nicely if she'd mind handling the invoicing and all other organisational aspects of the company for you (making sure you submit your accounts and pay you VAT etc. on time, conversing with your accountant to ask the questions you've been meaning to ask but keep putting off). You can pay her from your company, but again speak to your accountant about how much you should pay her for it to be tax efficient, and whether it makes sense to make her a shareholder too.

Being married comes with a whole bunch of tax-related perks - there are ways you can take both partners incomes into account when calculating your taxes from sources. Again, speak to that lovely accountant.

w.r.t. the mortgage question - go via a broker that covers the ""whole of market"". Do a little bit of googling to find one that specialising in contractors (I found one using the http://www.contractoruk.com/ forums, but they specialise in IT contractors so might be of little use to you). By going via a broker that specialises in contractors they'll be able to find you a decent deal (all whole of market brokers will), but will also be able to present your case to the mortgage lender in a favourable light (the main benefit of using a specialised broker). Start saving now (I'm guessing with 70k income and low outgoings you should have a fair amount already saved, but don't stress out if you don't yet - you've taken a good first step in the right direction :) ). You want to aim for a 15% deposit to get a good deal - you can get a mortgage with a 10% deposit, but the rates won't be as great.

Finally, buy a couple of the books from http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/wiki/recommendedreading and start reading. I'd recommend starting with Money Tree - http://www.amazon.co.uk/Money-Tree-Money-make-save-ebook/dp/B00ABMPBEC - £6 for the ebook and it's pretty quick and easy to read. It's a pretty basic book, but covers a wide spread of info (investing, taxes, savings etc.) and so gives you a decent introduction to personal finance.

It's still self important. Everyone knows to clear their windscreen before they set off, clear snow, and so on.

The Russians in London don't seem to have a problem with it though, I guess they need a name for that: Young Upwardly-mobile Russian Professionals.

The independent caters to much narrower audience through its content, while the others tend to cover all bases - there is something for everyone. Sport, politics, celebrity news, gossip. 


The diet coke ad was pretty troll like, and did create a reaction, though limited by men and some women. I think it wasn't a larger reactions because of a few things... Men and women are not fundamentally the same, objectifying in the same way does not create the same reaction or social stigmas with the general populous. Then there is a issue of volume - women are objectified on a much larger scale. While that doesn't make it tit for tat, again it just can't replicate the same level of reaction or the same theoretical damage. Finally considering both of the above objectification physique wise of females has been ingrained in society as OK for so long, while the same for males is unusual and why everyone knows the diet coke advert.


I think, personally, its the idea, the vibe behind the topless women in newspapers rather than the actual content. It's the nonchalant nature towards it because of the format. Normally we would be going on the internet on phones, tablets (which are pretty inconspicuous) or home / private computers. It's pretty improbable people would be able to display a A3 image of a topless woman or naked man while walking down the street, or on a bus, or at work (And I do appreciate many people reading the sun in public would skip past page 3 because of embarrassment really) - and if archived it would be received differently from having a newspaper open. As mentioned we have subs that are NSFW and such, with the same being printed in newspapers the view on this is so much different, with that being the problem rather than nakedness itself.


I would not describe myself as a feminist. I am not actively involved with anything like that, I don't normally visit those subs, I was not one to sign the petition and I have little involvement in general - but the disparity here is hard to deny, and I didn't think it was that big a deal for them to remove it when it at least could be contributing to sexism - and lets face it, they didn't remove it because of pressure or for anyone's good but their own.

France spent 11.6% of GDP on health care, a figure much higher than the average spent by countries in Europe 

Supplemental coverage may be bought from private insurers, **most of them non-profit**

the model of finance in the French health care system is based on a social insurance model, contributions to the program are based on income

The first is a government responsibility that fixes the rate at which medical expenses should be negotiated 

The second government responsibility is oversight of health-insurance funds

On your points though: Just getting Europe once and not doing very well in it doesn't make us a European side big enough to attract a high calibre of player than we have been. I'd much rather us go for it whole heartedly and really make a name for ourselves by either getting out of CL group stages, or (if in the CL to begin with) finishing 3rd in the group and going on to make a challenge for the Europa league.  

If we want to invest for Europe, there's also no reason we couldn't do it this summer, when players actually have Europe to look forward to and be attracted to. This summer just gone was going to be our ""depth building"" summer, but because of the exits it became a re-building summer. Now this next summer coming, with Europe to look forward to (hopefully) we'll have far fewer first team exits and a good number of players in (around 5 maybe?) that can be considered solidly first team/depth players. Then we can try for Europe, a cup run, and a high league finish. Why limit ourselves when we've shown what we can do?  

As for the quality, yes Arsenal have been flying thanks to Sanchez who is carrying them ridiculously, and United do have ridiculous fire power, but both have shown that they can drop points to anyone. Tottenham could be in with as much of a shout as Arsenal, because Eriksen gets them 3 points after 80 minutes every other bloody game.  

And, most importantly: Why the hell not try to win a Europa trophy? Stronger teams around for it maybe, but we're showing that we're as good as any other team atm, and there's no reason we couldn't give it a damn good go, with a good squad, a good manager and a good run, who knows.",null,0,null,1421838420,null,0,false,0,cnvy2uo,null,t3_2sz3yr,null,t1_cnvy2uo,null,t1_cnuivah,null,null,null,1424488079,null,2,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,2,null

You can choose not to believe me - it doesn't really matter, careless driving with dangerous consequences is a common occurrence regardless.

&gt;It's still self important.

Self-preservation is fairly self-important, I'm sure you'll agree.  I don't think you've ever been in a similar situation - such a close call really gets the blood pumping. 

&gt;It's still self important. Everyone knows to clear their windscreen before they set off, clear snow, and so on. People are a bit lacklustre in this country at doing all of that

Again, ""everybody does it"" is not a defence.

&gt;We don't know every drivers particular situation - for example we may judge somebody speeding - what if he's rushing to get someone to a hospital? Can it be justified?

Was this guy rushing someone to hospital?  I guess we'll never know.  I'd bet large sums of money he was just carelessly late.

&gt;Ultimately we can define anything like this as careless, wreckless or better yet 'dangerous' and let it become a crime.

Weaselly quotation marks for dangerous?  You're implying this behaviour isn't dangerous?  As the driver of a large chunk of metal you have a legal obligation to ensure you and it are fit to be on the roads.  

Highway Code, section 229:

&gt;Before you set off you MUST be able to see, so clear all snow and ice from all your windows 

&gt;You MUST ensure that lights are clean and number plates are clearly visible and legible 

&gt;Make sure the mirrors are clear and the windows are demisted thoroughly 

&gt;Remove all snow that might fall off into the path of other road users

Simple really.

&gt;but let's face it his windscreen would probably be clear in a matter of minutes if he had his blowers on and many drivers do this

Again, again, AGAIN, just because some people do it does NOT make it ok.  Who gives a fuck if it would have been clear in a couple of minutes when he could have put this guy in hospital beforehand?  Are you a troll or just having a bit of a slow morning?

&gt;Worst case scenario from this is a minor collision at &lt;10mph.

""Oh it's OK, it would have only been a little crash!""  Ludicrous fortune-telling.

&gt;If the cyclist did get knocked off he was not aware enough (cyclists/pedestrians) can make more complex manoeuvres quickly.

This doesn't make sense.  Are you suggesting the cyclist is at fault for not moving out of the way?

&gt;France spent 11.6% of GDP on health care, a figure much higher than the average spent by countries in Europe

But its not as simple as that. Only 77.8% of that is spent by the government, 22.2% is spent by private companies. Which means actual government spending on healthcare is 9% of GDP.

The UK spends 9.6% of GDP on health care, but 84% is spent by the government, and only 16% by private companies. Which means Actual government spending on healthcare is 8% of GDP.

The French health service makes up 16.3% of all government spending, and in the UK it's 16%. So spending is virtually identical between the two. However, as I have stated, the French system tends to produce better results, with more doctors and less preventable deaths.

My best friend knew I'm a huge fan of time travel and shows with deep backstories, and thought I'd like DW. He breifly explained the show to me, then showed me ""Girl in the Fireplace"" and ""The Empty Child"" (*This happened during Tennant's run*). After those two episodes, completely intrigued by the history behind the show, I decided to start from the very beginning. It took me about a year to get through the classics (skipping most of the reconstructions), with a brief hiatus during the Third Doctor's run, but eventually I got caught up (and finally watched the second part of The Empty Child / The Doctor Dances two-parter after a year) just about the time Series 6 started. 

It was great having very little foreknowledge of what was to come as I got some great surprises (hearing about the Time War from the Ninth Doctor and that no other Time Lords survived was a pretty big shock), and being able to catch all the little references in the new series has been great.

Then you are atheist. *A*theism is simply a rejection of theism. Theism is the assertion or belief that a god exists. If you reject that then you are de facto atheist. Agnosticism refers to the knowledge of whether a god exists or not. So if you claim to possess knowledge that god does or doesn't exist then you are *gnostic*. If you don't claim any knowledge about if a god does or doesn't exist then you are *agnostic*.

The wider community (opinion based largely on facebook) maybe not so much.

In the same way as they did for Lucas and Henderson, they've already been on the back of Markovic, Can and Lallana (and gone back round on Lucas, Henderson and even Rodgers).  Lallana was maybe the one which alleviated fears a little earlier because his pedigree gave him his chance in the team sooner and he looked impressive.

What people need to understand is that world class players now cost £40-60m, not £20m per a few years ago.  Ergo, £20m players now are the £8-10m players we've bought previously.

I understand the argument that we need to be buying world class players but this is unrealistic given their cost (in fees and wages) and our recent lack of Champions League football consistency.

As such, and as has largely been the case for a good number of years, owners and managers now, we need to take a punt on players in the next bracket and hope they fulfill their potential.  On this, the manager, and the transfer committee, will ultimately be judged.

None of these players, at c.20 years of age, can be expected to slot in and take the team to another level in the way Fabregas and Costa at Chelsea or Sanchez at Arsenal can.  They need to be given time; a) to actually get some games, and b) to prove their ability, in the same way that Lucas and Henderson did.

I genuinely think we have a couple of gems here now, in Moreno, Markovic and Can especially.  I also think Lallana and, to a degree, Lovren and Lambert have a future and big part to play in the squad.  They're not going to win us the league this season, or maybe even next, but they'll keep improving, gelling and becoming a proper team under Rodgers.  People need to get realistic, get behind Rodgers and the players, give him a few years to really bring them, as well as the likes of Ibe, Coady and Sinclair, through, as he has done with Sterling, and then see where we are.  I'd like to think Manquillo will be a deputy to Flanagan when he's back.  Balotelli I just don't know.

If there is a serious, sustained downtrend in form and ability to compete then it should be reevaluated but until then we should be supportive and not knee jerk.  We started this season with a number of huge setbacks - Suarez gone, not getting Sanchez who was clearly the succession plan, Sturridge injured, a group of new, young players to assimilate and the need to change our style of play to fit the new look team.

ps Coutinho was magical last night.  We need to keep him and Sterling out of the clutches of the Spaniards at all cost.",null,0,null,1421840273,null,0,false,0,cnvyhbf,null,t3_2t50he,null,t1_cnvyhbf,null,t3_2t50he,null,null,null,1424487891,null,16,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,16,null

Objectification means that you reduce a person down to a single characteristic (usually a characteristic that has some use for the objectifier) rather than considering them a whole person.

I would say there's no problem with this with strangers. Our society runs on the basis of our ability to interact with people based on their role, rather than as a unique individual. In commercial life, people *are* objects: they serve a commercial purpose, and unless you're working with them in a team, it's not only unnecessary but also inefficient to treat that person as an individual.

However, in other spheres of life you are expected to treat those around you as individuals. I would say that objectifying your friends and family, close colleagues and frequent acquaintances is an unhealthy attitude. 

Objectification is saying that attractive (or whatever other characteristic) is *all* that person is. They're not a human being, they're no different to a poster on your wall... it's sheer coincidence that they walk around and make noises. It'd make no difference to you if it turned out that they were a ""philosophical zombie"" with no thoughts or consciousness, because all you're interested in is the single characteristic which makes them useful to you.

If your friends knew you thought about them this way they would be upset and consider it a betrayal of their friendship that you give them so little consideration. It's borderline sociopathic -- you're dehumanising them, seeing them only through the lens of what they can do for you as a tool.

This does not mean that you cannot find friends attractive or even masturbate to them.

I was ""agnostic"" in the popular sense of the term quite a few years ago. I did not fit in either of the ""agnostic"" boxes here because I did not believe OR not believe that a god existed. I just simply didn't know. I didn't reject theism, because I didn't not believe that a god existed. I equally didn't accept it.

Rich families already produce the majority of successful children, and poor families already are hugely over-represented with mental, criminal and other issues.

I think its far less damaging for someone to live of the state to a tune of £20,000 a year (less than the price of incarcerating someone I add) than to allow people who do nothing with their wealth other than horde and essentially further nepotism to pass it down to their children to give them an advantage over those less lucky in the birth lottery already in other ways.

This is still a thought in progress in my head and I'm just bouncing it around.  

The idea is to promote a society where someones success depends as much as possible on that individuals merits, not birth advantages (such as wealth and connections)

I think removing inheritance helps with this because if you know your children cannot survive from your success or be boosted by it (beyond what is really impossible to stop - a famous surname, connections, etc) it gives you an incentive to create a society where their merits allow them to succeed.  Rather than create a world where you can horde wealth to help them succeed.  

You could even use this to help fund the first 50 years or so of Basic Income (as the old wealthy die, and the taxes on what would have been inherited fund the transition), or to create a sovereign wealth fund etc.  It's basically a way to remove wealth from families who are rich because they have passed wealth down through generations.  Not to remove the opportunity or lifestyle that goes with being successful.

It's along the same lines that Basic Income will enable and promote entrepreneurial behavior - because it removes the risk that failing means you lose access to your basic human requirements.

&gt; “Hipster” is a term co-opted for use as a meaningless pejorative in order to vaguely call someone else’s authenticity into question and, by extension, claim authenticity for yourself.

&gt; It serves no conversational function and imparts no information, save for indicating the opinions and preferences of the speaker.

&gt; Meanwhile, a market myth has sprung up around the term, as well as a cultural bogeyman consisting of elusive white 20-somethings who wear certain clothes (but no one will agree on what), listen to certain music (no one can agree on this either), and act a certain way (you’ve probably sensed the pattern on your own).

&gt; You can’t define what “that kind of behavior or fashion or lifestyle” actually is, nor will you ever be able to. That’s because you don’t use “hipster” to describe an actual group of people, but to describe a fictional stereotype that is an outlet for literally anything that annoys you.

&gt; The twist, of course, is that if it weren’t for your own insecurities, nothing that a “hipster” could do or wear would ever affect you emotionally. But you are insecure about your own authenticity - “Do I wear what I wear because I want to? Do I listen to my music because I truly like it? I’m certainly not like those filthy hipsters!” - so you project those feelings.

&gt; Suffice it to say, no one self-identifies as a hipster; the term is always applied to an Other, to separate the authentic Us from the inauthentic, “ironic” Them.

My original point:

- You can objectify a model in a magazine without objectifying the entire female gender, and in particular the women whom you know personally. There's no logical link between them.

Your counter point:

- But there's nothing wrong with finding people attractive.

My counter point:

- There's a difference between objectifying people and finding them attractive. Objectifying strangers is okay, objectifying those with whom you have a personal relationship is not. Finding someone attractive is always okay.

Your counter point:

- People don't find it upsetting to be thought of as attractive. (I never said they did, I said they would find it upsetting to know a friend objectifies them).

I disagree, as you said yourself, under the French system, the rich pay more. That additional private spending under the French system shows that a greater proportion of those that can afford to pay for their own healthcare are doing so, which leaves more resources available for those who cannot afford to pay for their own healthcare. 

Yes overall spending might be higher in France, but it is the rich who bear the weight of that cost, not the state, and no the poor, and everyone ends up with a better healthcare system.

being forced to use bt dns, which others have mentioned, is a pain in the arse. try flush your dns cache on your computer and set dns servers manually from your pc, not sure if that's enough to completely bypass bt dns routing.

I think it would destroy medical research to be honest - the number of studies which require knockout mice and are fatal by necessity is huge.

In terms of Nuclear Power - I don't see how it is realistic to pursue economic autarky (which has the advantages of resilience to disasters and financial crises) and yet refuse to exploit our shale resources or build nuclear plants given that at the moment we meet our energy demands via vast amounts of imported coal.

But I strongly support the land value tax, citizen's income, co-operatives,  drug policy (I actually support full legalisation), removal of charitable status from private schools, I would personally also support the complete abolition of the monarchy but I'm aware that's rather extreme.

null,false,thehollyhopdrive,uk,Haywards Heath,null,"There are a few policy statements you've missed out that highlight that this is a reduction in immigration controls rather than an ""open door"" policy:

&gt; MG400 We will replace existing British Immigration law with an Immigration law which does not discriminate directly on the grounds listed above (see MG205). This law will be based on the principle of fair and prompt treatment of applicants rather than on excluding dishonest applicants whatever the cost to the honest ones. We will consult widely with affected groups to ensure that features of the current law which are of concern to them are addressed.

So people still have to apply, but rather than putting them in detention centres we're actually going to treat them like human beings.

&gt; MG410 We will aim to ensure that UK immigration control takes place primarily at ports of entry so that no resident is required to carry proof of residence.

&gt; MG411 We will implement a visibly independent appeal process for Immigration decisions.

&gt; MG412 No prospective immigrant will be held in detention for migration-related reasons, other than in the most exceptional circumstances, eg a prospective migrant who poses a serious danger to public safety.

&gt; MG414 Transport providers must not be penalised for bringing people without the required visas, etc. to the UK.

&gt; MG415 We will provide advice and assistance in appropriate languages at ports of entry and provide legal aid for immigration cases.

&gt; MG416 We will provide accurate information about conditions in the UK to prospective migrants.

&gt; MG417 We will undertake a thorough review of UK Immigration Practices and the UK Immigration Service to ensure that racist features are removed and immigration officers receive sufficient suitable training. We will encourage greater ethnic minority participation in the Immigration Service.

&gt; MG418 We will ensure that sufficient staff and resources are available to effect these policies.

&gt; EU781 The Green Party supports the principle of a Common Immigration Policy for the European Union. We believe that shared obligations towards Asylum Seekers (see EU780) and immigrants provides the best available way to deal with future challenges arising from refugees displaced by climate change and other factors. The Green Party's liberal policies on migration to this country and the rights of migrants would meet such obligations. They are set out in the Nationality, Migration and Refugees &amp; Asylum Seekers sections of the PSS.

I think this demonstrates that there is clearly still an immigration application process in place, and the Green party will work towards making that a fairer and less harsh system. Also, by encouraging other EU members to share in the obligation as set out in the Common Immigration Policy for the European Union, it would mean that the load of asylum seekers will be better distributed.

One of the things that we all need to realise with these policy statements is that this is the end goal. This is where the Green party would like to be ideally, and not all of these changes can happen overnight. Take MG300 for example. This clearly states that the reduction in controls would happen in step with helping to achieve greater equity with non-Western countries, which in turn would lead to less demand on immigration. Sure, some of this stuff may feel a little too idealistic given the current state of play, but these are meant to be the ideal end-goal policies of the Greens, not what would immediately happen were they to be in power.",null,0,null,1421844855,null,0,false,0,cnvznk8,null,t3_2t2j06,null,t1_cnvznk8,null,t1_cnvxrjj,null,null,null,1424487344,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

There's no evidence to suggest that a Nationalised system would absorb costs at a central level in order to reduce the burden on the individual user.

null,false,lovechip,null,null,null,"Local food in London is globally influenced. There are lots of places to find British food but don't miss out the world renowned food with influences from across the globe. This is actually a good list of places that do traditional british food: http://www.timeout.com/london/restaurants/londons-best-british-restaurants

For something fun, reasonably priced and a bit unusual, the covered market in Brixton has loads of great little restuarants/cafes. It's quite a cool sort of place, where you find lots of trendy types: http://brixtonmarket.net/brixton-village/

Upper Street in Angel, Islington is crammed full of really great restaurants. There's a lot of turkish and greek food there. Some places also do shisha so you can sit outside with a blanket and have that too. 

For really amazing food if you're having a blow out, I'd recommend 34 in Grosvenor Square. My friend is a chef there. It's unbelievable food and service. They also have an amazing cocktail bar and sometimes someone playing the grand piano in the background: http://www.34-restaurant.co.uk/

Brick Lane is famous for it's curry houses, but around Spitalfields and Hanbury Street on the way to Brick Lane are loads of really nice cafes and coffee shops. Think there's a really good fish and chip shop on the corner of Hanbury Street too. 

On Wardour Street and in a few other locations there's Hummus Bros, which is great for DELICIOUS hummus with different toppings, nice staff and pretty cheap. I used to go there all the damn time. http://www.hbros.co.uk/new/home.php

If you're looking for drinks, I highly, highly recommend The Night Jar in Old Street. It's a 1920s speakeasy style bar. They only let in enough people to be seated, you get table service. The cocktails are insane (steaming teapot is awesome) and if you book/go earlier in the evening there's really great music: https://www.barnightjar.com/

Benito's Hat and Chilango's are great places to get burritos. YUM! I have eaten so many of these: http://benitos-hat.com/

Wahaca is also amazing for Mexican food: http://www.wahaca.co.uk/

Bukowski grill does amazing burgers. Agh I'm so hungry: http://www.bukowski-grill.co.uk/

Attendant is amazing, set in what used to be Victorian, public toilets haha http://www.the-attendant.com/

Dans Le Noir is somewhere you can go to eat in pitch black. Odd, but I've heard good things about it! http://london.danslenoir.com/

Frae does really lovely frozen yoghurt which is pretty cheap and nice little dessert to carry around with you. That's in Angel, Islington too: http://www.frae.co.uk/

Areas to go to where there's lots of food would be Upper Street (tube stop is Angel), Old Street (Old Street tube stop), Shoreditch, Spitalfields, Brick Lane, Hoxton Square, Brixton. I'd personally avoid all the Leicester Square, Covent Garden, China Town, Oxford Street. It's total chaos and you'll probably end up in a massive chain restaurant there for the tourists, paying out loads of money. 

Also don't miss out on going to some good pubs. I'm not that clued up on pubs, but look for ones that have a good selection of craft beers as that is really huge in the UK at the moment. This might be a good place to start: http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/apr/24/top-10-craft-beer-pubs-central-london

Hope that helps! There is just SO much out there. The areas I mentioned were good are places you can pretty much wander around in a daze for a bit and there will be loads of places to choose from all round you.

null,false,Olog,null,null,null,"&gt; The porn industry will not let this happen.

You'll probably find that porn industry is supporting this rather than not let it happen. Why? Because they actually agree with children not watching their content. This thing blocks children, doesn't hinder adults, why would they not be in support of this?

&gt; I payed for The Internet not a filtred version of it.

You get the whole internet, just turn off the filters by clicking the button labelled ""no thank you"" which pops up when you first try to access a filtered site.

&gt; Sky (and all other ISP's) should be offering parental control tools (though I know that when my parents ""used"" them, all but badly they were easy to get around) to censor the parts fo the 'net that they don't want their kids to see.

This is exactly what they are doing. The whole thing is just way misinterpreted by Reddit and media in general. This really isn't some government censorship scheme. This is quite simply parental control options offered to customers.

If people actually read [how these things work](https://corporate.sky.com/media-centre/our-blog/2015/sky-broadband-shield-rolling-out-to-all-our-customers), they'd see that there's no conspiracy here. You don't want filtering, you click the don't enable filtering when it asks you. Or alternatively you go to your broadband settings page and turn it off. You want porn filtered but not some other potentially questionable material, go to the settings page and untick a few boxes. If you find that some website is blocked that shouldn't be, go whitelist it in the settings, or vice versa and blacklist it. You want porn enabled on your own computer but not on your child's, whitelist your mac-address in the settings.

Other pages than just porn being blocked is not a slippery slope or inadequacy of the technology or a conspiracy, it's there by design. These things are designed to block other stuff too because some parents actually want to block that, there are specific check boxes there to block different kinds of content. Uncheck whatever you think your child should be able to see. (Of course these things never work 100% accurately anyway, so this only applies in general, certainly some websites are going to be miscategorised.)

&gt; One more issue, availability. So, youv'e blocked porn from your home PC, well done. What about your tablet or your kids mobile phone?

Good question. And this new surge of these new always on filtering options is exactly the answer to that, and the reason why Cameron was pushing for this. For a long time ISPs have offered parental control options. But they're usually some software thingy you install on your computer and limited to Windows (maybe even a specific version). And are hard to install for non-technical parents, and if they setup their child's account as admin when they first got the computer, then it's of course trivial to uninstall whatever. So in short, if you're clueless, you probably won't get it right.

These new filters adopted by most ISPs are on the router instead of installed on the user device. Everything going through that router is subjected to the parental controls. This is the way it really should have been done in the first place, because it makes a whole lot more sense this way. But the other option was easier for ISPs, they could just license some McAfee family safety thingy, hide it somewhere in their website and be done with it. Probably very few people who'll find it anyway. In other words, they were doing a half-assed job at something that they really should be doing.

When Cameron wanted these things ""on by default"" what he meant is that parents who don't have a clue don't need to do anything. It's really the same as your Sky box having a child lock enabled by default. You don't want it, disable it. If you have no clue that there even is porn available, it'll stay on. ISPs would probably have moved to put the filters on the router anyway sooner or later, because quite frankly it's a better system and better service.

What makes you think the UK's regulations are different? You can't book the time as *both* sick *and* holiday. Your employer *pays* you for your holiday time, so they get sickness benefit for sick days that you expected to take as holiday. Ergo, you should book the day as ""sick"", ergo you haven't used up a ""holiday"" day.

I'd imagine that the truth is that the UK's regulations don't actually mention this corner case, so it has been open to interpretation to some degree. Now it's been tested in the ECJ, I find it hard to believe that the UK courts would disagree.

The working poor, and the workless underclass are a problem. 

She then goes on to say that they're vilified which is something I expect most of this subreddit to agree on - the tory rhetoric is all about ""hard working families"" and benefit sanctions etc. I agree with her there.

But most recently all this 'GamerGate' BS has been appearing: 'some bad men said some bad things', and 'some SJWs faked being hacked to gain sympathy, and demonise their opponents'.

So my view is they're all as bad as each other, and they basically wind each other up, egging each other on to even more idiotic behaviour, and that they need each other to say 'See: we're right about them!'.

...oh and occasionally someone will ask in outoftheloop 'What happened to [subreddit]?' and the answer will be that SJWs became admins, and banned everybody who didn't tow the line.

&gt;SOME readers, particularly those used to the left-right split in most democratic legislatures, are bamboozled by The Economist’s political stance. We like free enterprise and tend to favour deregulation and privatisation. But we also like gay marriage, want to legalise drugs and disapprove of monarchy. So is the newspaper right-wing or left-wing?

&gt;Neither, is the answer. The Economist was founded in 1843 by James Wilson, a British businessman who objected to heavy import duties on foreign corn. Mr Wilson and his friends in the Anti-Corn Law League were classical liberals in the tradition of Adam Smith and, later, the likes of John Stuart Mill and William Ewart Gladstone. This intellectual ancestry has guided the newspaper's instincts ever since: it opposes all undue curtailment of an individual’s economic or personal freedom. But like its founders, it is not dogmatic. Where there is a liberal case for government to do something, The Economist will air it. Early in its life, its writers were keen supporters of the income tax, for example. Since then it has backed causes like universal health care and gun control. But its starting point is that government should only remove power and wealth from individuals when it has an excellent reason to do so.

&gt;The concepts of right- and left-wing predate The Economist's foundation by half a century. They first referred to seating arrangements in the National Assembly in Paris during the French Revolution. Monarchists sat on the right, revolutionaries on the left. To this day, the phrases distinguish conservatives from egalitarians. But they do a poor job of explaining The Economist’s liberalism, which reconciles the left’s impatience at an unsatisfactory status quo with the right’s scepticism about grandiose redistributive schemes. So although its credo and its history are as rich as that of any reactionary or revolutionary, The Economist has no permanent address on the left-right scale. In most countries, the political divide is conservative-egalitarian, not liberal-illiberal. So it has no party allegiance, either. When it covers elections, it gives its endorsement to the candidate or party most likely to pursue classically liberal policies. It has thrown its weight behind politicians on the right, like Margaret Thatcher, and on the left, like Barack Obama. It is often drawn to centrist politicians and parties who appear to combine the best of both sides, such as Tony Blair, whose combination of social and economic liberalism persuaded it to endorse him at the 2001 and the 2005 elections (though it criticised his government’s infringements of civil liberties).

&gt;When The Economist opines on new ideas and policies, it does so on the basis of their merits, not of who supports or opposes them. Last October, for example, it outlined a programme of reforms to combat inequality. Some, like attacking monopolies and targeting public spending on the poor and the young, had a leftish hue. Others, like raising retirement ages and introducing more choice in education, were more rightish. The result, ""True Progressivism"", was a blend of the two: neither right nor left, but all the better for it, and coming instead from what we like to call the radical centre.

null,false,inawordno,eng-westmidlands,Brummie,null,"&gt;She equates working class with feckless under class - and I don't think rest of society does that, and I don't see her evidence for doing so. 

I think she disagrees with the shift. There used to be a working class. Now there is middle class and then a desirable underclass. The working class are either dragged up to the middle class. Or left to fend for themselves in a new group who are attacked for being terrible.

&gt;She thinks she has been put down upon all her life for being working class, but readily admits she failed at her own education first time round because she fucked about in class.

Don't you find the fact the UKIP don't have a manifesto telling? The last one was dismissed as ""drivel"" by the party leader and the party's founder left because he didn't like the direction they were going in. The Green manifesto has been around for a long time and changes very little - even with the party name changes. 

For the ""bonkers"" policies. Yes, in the main, I can defend them. I get the opposition to developing more nuclear power plants with current technology. It's throwing good money after bad and it all goes in the pockets of foreign conglomerates - there are many other objections of course. I also understand their position that GMO should not be a corporate-led free-for-all and should be more diligently researched. I don't have a fundamental objection to GM in general though. I want my glow-in-the-dark sweetcorn.

The one I still struggle with is the one about non-custodial sentences for *female* criminals. I think it's a clumsy policy and I've been trying to better understand the thought process behind it. It seems to be based around the harm caused to children if their mother is incarcerated - I get that but would think that fathers are also important enough for that to be taken into account. Frankly though, as can be seen in places like Finland and Denmark, our high crime levels are partly a result of the insane levels of economic disparity in this country. Prison is an expensive and futile method of punishment for all but the most serious criminals.

null,false,Rippsy,null,null,null,"&gt;Are you proposing that everyone be made to live off £20k a year or that plus whatever their job pays?

Yes, but the £20k is not a final number, it's just thrown in to this mix for the sake or argument.

&gt;If it's the former that's essentially what the Soviets did and it didn't really pan out for them

If you are trying to say Communism failed, I'd reply with we haven't tried it yet.  All attempts at a communist regime have been so massively corrupt its almost insulting to compare them to the actual real concept.

&gt;if it's the latter i think you're going to find that very hard to fund without pissing off the people you need to fund it

The people who fund it - will be everyone.  That's how basic income works.

&gt; If you remove all inheritance you remove most of the incentive to save long-term

No, you remove the incentive to save for the sake of hording.  People will still save to buy nice things.  They know that once they die the money will be given back to the government to provide for the SW:Fund which can provide Basic Income or directly for BasicIncome.

&gt;unless you sky-rocket the VAT rate you're going to run into problems, if you sky-rocket the VAT price rich people will simply shop/live elsewhere.

And it is their choice to do so - but they wont be taking all their money with them when they leave.  If they created money from our economy they owe money to the economy - rates to be decided of course.

&gt;£20k per year is pretty astronomical if you're just giving it to everyone willy-nilly, and will remove any incentive to work for a lot of people, meaning more menial jobs simply won't get done

Would you stop working if you received £20k a year? - I wouldn't.  I'd probably start my own business doing something I loved, or provide a social wealth to my community by engaging further with it.

These things are currently not valued by capitalism and this needs to change.

&gt; there's no way I'm being a street cleaner or working in a sewage plant if you're paying me 20 grand to stay at home!

We aren't quite there yet, yes we need more automated jobs and higher productivity than we currently have, but we are getting there!  Also, if you get your £20k, but it doesn't provide enough for your hobbies you either create a source of income (self employed) or you gain employment to help bolster your BI.

&gt; Look at just how shitty the basic infrastructure of communist countries was/is to see how this will turn out. People want to help each other but there is a limit, and if you push it it will break, and people will leave (hence Berlin Wall).

Again, we tried communism before we were ready with informational systems, computers or anything that would actually allow a decent amount of transparency in the governance of the country.  It was philosophically superb, but technologically way ahead of its time.

&gt;People want to help each other but there is a limit, and if you push it it will break, and people will leave (hence Berlin Wall).

Yes, the limit is when they feel they help other people at the loss to themselves or their own success.  Hence the £20k flat income which provides a minimum standard of existence regardless of if you choose to be a stay at home mother, or a surgeon.",null,0,null,1421849505,null,0,false,0,cnw1bo4,null,t3_2t2j06,null,t1_cnw1bo4,null,t1_cnw0llz,null,null,null,1424486565,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

That is a bit of a stretch isn't it. 

I once read a report proposing that the ugly and short will breed with the ugly and short which in a few million years will give us two different classes of human. The other being tall and beautiful. I found it a bit hard to swallow. It was also a huge time-scale.

I think you can criticise the people in charge for promoting - or at least not doing enough - about rising inequality without accusing them of some sort of unconscious eugenics.

&gt;This is a foreshadow to new inequalities which will contrast the poor as literal subhumans, unable to access the treatments, therapies and augmentations that turn the privileged into comparative superhumans.

The trend of rising inequality has been going since around the 80s maybe some time before.

And being in a very small minority means you're even less likely to be correct. 

The Sun has a daily circulation of 2.2 million. The petition by NMP3 could only muster 217,000 signatures *over two years*. That's less than ten percent of their daily circulation, not even their readership. 

Either people didn't agree with the campaign, or they just didn't care enough. 

Not caring about a matter is just as valid as caring either way. It means it's a non-issue that the majority of people aren't fussed about. 

&gt;And they haven't forced the sun into making this change ... The Sun could have very happily carried on as they were.

So you don't think the protests, petitions, 'creative activism', pressure on retailers, being branded as 'supermarket *porn*', had anything to do with the decision?

Small minorities shouldn't be able to influence the content of a newspaper in any way other than circulation. It's a shame that The Sun gave in, it gave credence to the campaign as opposed to simply ignoring them for the squeaky wheel it was. 

It's a step backwards for women. Victorian values have no place in the 21st century. 

Getting rid of Page 3 is encouraging the supposed children that will now be ""protected"" that they should be ashamed of their bodies, making them more self-conscious and encouraging body shame. 

Do we now stop people going topless on beaches to protect the children?

Do we make them close their eyes in changing rooms?

No. It's just a harmless pair of boobs. 

We should be putting effort into educating children not trying to shield them from things which have no proven effect on them whatsoever.

First, international trade.

International influence comes down to similar arguments. Pro-EU say we need to be part of a bloc to compete with the big players, eurosceptics say that we have more influence as 1 less powerful seat at the table (we're still the 5th or 6th biggest economy in the world depending who you ask) than not being there at all and having to ask the EU if they'd mind mentioning the UK's concerns at the meeting.

deterrence value. Women sentenced to less than a year have insufficient time to complete any

people regard imprisonment of women as just desserts for crime committed but the cost to society
is enormous, not simply the cost of keeping women in prison (each prison place represents a
capital investment of about £77k annually) but also the indirect cost of family disruption, damage
to children and substitute care, lost employment and subsequent mental health problems. The
continued use of prison for women appears to offer no advantages at huge financial and social
cost""

No but there's lots of evidence - even anecdotal from your own school maybe - to say poorer working class people are more likely to misbehave at school and end up less focused on school work.

null,false,Froolow,null,null,null,"The NHS at the moment costs £110bn per year (roughly) and there are (roughly) 70 million people in the UK. This means each person needs to find an average of £131 per month (£1571 per year) to fully fund the NHS to the level it is at now.

However this is a bad way of looking at things. At the moment is costs £131/month to provide healthcare to people because top-rate taxpayers are paying a *vast* amount to subsidise poorer people. A 35 year-old banker earning £100,000 pays about £530 / month for the NHS which they are very unlikely to use (because they are young and rich). If we assume the new provider naievely charges £131/month to all comers, the NHS instantly loses a very large source of funding because the rich won't pay the missing £400 / month out of the goodness of their heart. At the same time, healthy younger people with low incomes might not be willing to purchase healthcare at *any* price unless forced to by the government, which raises the 'average cost per patient' of the system (because healthy younger people aren't purchasing the same insurance as high-risk older people) which will cause yet more people to drop out. Eventually the market will equilibriate; the young and healthy will be mostly uninsured (even though they would like to be insured) and the old and frail will be over-insured (they will be paying a huge amount for their insurance relative to their risk). The inefficiencies of running such a system would likely increase the average cost to be insured to enormous levels, and the distribution will be grossly unfair - the rich will pay much less than they do now.

Additionally, a fully privatised system is a staggeringly inefficient way of running a healthcare service for a variety of other reasons. The Americans spend about $3.8tn (!) on healthcare for their 320m citizens, for an average annual spend of $11,000 per citizen, or £655 / month / citizen. There's no evidence their system is any better than ours, and plenty of evidence their system is considerably worse in many areas (and often the reasons their system is worse is for exactly the same reasons it costs more, so we have a good theoretical model for why Americans pay five times as much as us). This is kind of interesting - the American system is so inefficient that the average American pays more for their healthcare than we make investment bankers pay for ours!

There are ways of having a mixed private / public system, but they are much less elegant than our system in my opinion; the government in these systems is constantly fighting against the tendancy of the market to try and uninsure young people and give discounts to the rich. Much better to internalise all of these market externalities and ensure equality of access at the same time.

Both have products that can substitute for Paula's Choice. There is a retinoids mega review that is not in the sidebar but can be found via the search function. We will be doing a vitamin C mega review in a couple of weeks which will include various antioxidant rich products.

Cetaphil has SLS: this is a known irritant, thins and dehydrates even healthy skin at concentrations as low as 1%. It is not recommended in atopic eczema (closely related to SD).

IMO go for multifunctional ingredients/ products. A sunscreen based on zinc oxide is also antimicrobial/ soothing/ calming so useful in acne vulgaris and seborrhoeic dermatitis, for example.

BHA is definitely worth including as an oil soluble exfoliant; both niacinamide and green tea extract may help reduce sebum production with regular use and are anti ageing, all three are useful in acne vulgaris and seborrhoeic dermatitis and all three are anti inflammatory.

Eye creams are not necessary, any good quality anti ageing serum will be fine for the eye area. If you are using a good serum, you may not need a pile of antioxidants in your moisturiser and can get away with something cheaper. Toners are not necessary either.

Frequent thorough *but gentle* cleansing is important in SD to remove sebum. From reading haircare forums conditioner-only washing can work in milder cases of SD if tea tree oil is included (research is at 5%) or an anti fungal shampoo is rotated in (but most pharmacy ones are loaded with sulphate surfactants).

Avoid natural oils and butters rich in oleic, stearic and palmitic acids. These either feed the malassezia yeast or are the main irritant. I have seen pure tea tree oil in discount stores - Home Bargains or B&amp;M or suchlike.

Lastly review your diet and lifestyle choices: this can impact hormone balance, systemic inflammation and potentially alter the amount and composition of your sebum. Look for your diet to be balanced and varied, nutrient dense and anti inflammatory. Especially consider oily fish (experts recommend up to four servings a week) for the long chain omega-3s and bioavailable vitamin D.",null,0,null,1421850881,null,0,false,0,cnw1xo6,null,t3_2t2fil,null,t1_cnw1xo6,null,t3_2t2fil,null,null,null,1424486210,null,5,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,5,null

I had to fill in the forms from the DWP for him because he couldn't do them himself. He had 2 ATOS assessments, 20 miles away, and because he had anxiety issues didn't want to take the bus, so I drove him. The first assessment was a bad day and it took everything I had to get him into my car, and then from the car to the assessment centre. Then the first question from the nurse, before we'd even sat down, was ""have you thought about suicide?"" No introductions, just straight into the big question.

The second assessment, 3 months later, was a ""good day"" which meant he was communicating verbally without prompting and managed to get up and dressed and in my car with minimal prodding from me. And in fact he was in generally okay spirits. Nowhere near what he was normally like before he started being depressed, but capable of normal conversation. The nurse was nice and friendly and made jokes, which put him at his ease and made him feel safe. She judged him not to be depressed enough to remain on ESA.

We started the appeal process, but it made him very stressed indeed and he wanted to withdraw because the money just wasn't worth the damage it was doing - it was making him worse. The day after the first assessment he was totally non-verbal, and he was again non-verbal the day we heard his benefits would be withdrawn. Before those incidents, he hadn't been non-verbal (for him, a symptom of the absolute depths of his depressive state) for over a year. We sent in a form saying we were withdrawing the claim. Several weeks later, we recieved a letter saying basically ""your claim is going forward. We will tell you when your hearing will be in 11-15 weeks."" Ten weeks later, we got a letter saying ""You didn't turn up to your hearing, so your claim has been dismissed.""

There is some discussion amongst people who are interested in this sort of thing as to exactly how European treaties relate to this point of constitutional law, but I believe the polite fiction is that the UK Parliament only chooses to comply with European regulations because it wants to, rather than because the treaty actually 'binds' them.

Practically - Not a chance. America is an excellent model of what happens if entrenched money moves into the healthcare system. The most powerful man in the most powerful nation in the world made it his one and only mission for eight years to reform healthcare in the US and - in the end - scraped a legal victory over a relatively minor reform to the current system of insurance-based payments. For example, providers will argue that they signed 'X'-year contracts with the UKIP administration to provide care, and if the government was in breach of contract they would have to pay a buy-out clause. Doesn't matter if the government actually legally *has* to do this, it will make the market skittish if they don't.

Choose a cleanser free of harsh surfactants like Simple KTS Refreshing Wash Gel or Boots Simply Sensitive Cleansing Wash. Exfoliate with an AHA or BHA (see mega review in sidebar).

Also consider the pH and ingredients of your shaving and dental care products, even shaving itself since this is exfoliating and can damage the skin barrier. Some men cannot tolerate daily wet shaving, they need to dry shave or even have 'designer stubble'.

Are you using sunscreen? Zinc oxide is antimicrobial and soothing/ calming. Other potentially useful active include sodium ascorbyl phosphate (form of vitamin C), niacinamide, green tea extract (polyphenol) and retinoids (vitamin A) - see our ingredients Wiki.

With diet get the basics in place: balanced, varied, anti inflammatory, low glycaemic index. Ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations, are eating plenty of healthy fats from oily fish, whole eggs, seeds like chia and pumpkin. Whilst there is nothing wrong with blending to make smoothies and smoothies, it is far from necessary and there is no research showing benefits in healthy populations AFAIK. Using your teeth, oral and digestive enzymes helps slow digestion and keeps the blood sugar level stable.

It is not recommended to exercise daily, rest and recovery days are as important as training days.

Sacking Adkins, in hindsight, was a good move, but equally there's no way to tell what we might have managed with him at the helm - we were already climbing out of the relegation zone, had just drawn away to Chelsea, and were basically looking like steadying the ship, when Cortese rocked it a treat but sacking him and getting a virtual unknown in the same morning.  

Poch managed to get the team playing a type of game that really paid off in the first half season he was in charge, because teams didn't expect it and weren't prepared for it. However it only paid off against the higher teams who didn't want to sit back. It didn't do well against lower teams, we really struggled to break them down. His second season (last season) obviously was good, very good, but there were still some trouble with the teams sitting back, but far more solid defensively... most of the time.  

When Cortese left I had hoped Poch might stay on, because he was always on about the project etc, but as soon as Tottenham came knocking you knew he was gone. The player exodus was also worrying, even if by the end of the window we'd done good business, the early part of it with 5 first team players gone and only 2 in was extremely worrying - as it stands now though....  

I couldn't be happier with the board, the squad, the management, the football or anything about Southampton FC really. I'd like a couple more home-grown players in the squad, one more youth coming through like Ward-Prowse (though that looks to be Reed to be fair) and I really, really want Rodriguez back, and for him not to just leave in the summer, he was a joy to watch last season, but equally he benefitted the most from Poch, and some of the players that made him so good (Lallana, Lambert, Shaw behind him on the wing) have all gone now.  

Rollercoaster is definitely the term for everything though. The low of our PL start (we were the first team who didn't win for the first 8 games to stay up), then the gradual incline of climbing out of the bottom 3, then the plunging depth of Adkins getting sacked, the climb from Poch through to the end of last season, the sodding underground flips and twists that was this summer, and now we're climbing to the clouds, and we're going to fly straight through them en route to our away games next season all over Europe.",null,0,null,1421852349,null,0,false,0,cnw2mrh,null,t3_2suzlj,null,t1_cnw2mrh,null,t3_2suzlj,null,null,null,1424485883,null,2,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,2,null

It used to be that it would be taken care of from whatever benefits you'd claim. But no, now they expect you to go into the housing place in person and pay back your benefits to go towards council tax. I knew nothing of the sort (nor did one of my then housemates) until a bill for £170 for myself showed up, and my housemates was close to £700.

I went into the housing place to refute it thinking it was just an error, but instead got told it would be deducted from my JSA and I had no say in the matter. They started taking £10 a week off me. Just enough to push me into more and more debt each month until it got to the beginning of this month when I had to move cities. I was looking at homelessness otherwise. 

Surely it's not hard to hand a leaflet out at the jobcentre, or send a letter out to those people you know will be affected (afterall, they do have their addresses). Nothing of the sort was done. How were we supposed to know it had changed when there was nobody to tell us? So now I'm stuck with this large council tax bill to my name (that thankfully isn't as much as what others owe). 

They don't even let you into the court room to dispute it when it comes to council tax. You're told to wait outside the room and if you don't agree with the outcome then you have to dispute it after the fact it is done.

I did that, I went to the housing place and instead of getting even just the court costs waived, they upped the amount they were taking off me. So now I have a court ordered amount coming off on top of council tax (which I've since moved but the council tax is still coming off 2 weeks later).

I mean, shit, I went down to 8st 4lbs (at 6ft) on the 6th of this month. Since moving back I'm 6lbs up, it got that bad.

If you think he played well against Sunderland, you must think our strikers have been fantastic this year. I haven't seen him have a complete performance where I thought he played well the entire time. If my side only sees things by the numbers, your side continually lowers and lowers the bar of what is deemed good enough for players. I love that Borini puts effort in and runs the entire time he's on the pitch, but literally everyone else does this too. It is the minimum a player should do for the club. Meanwhile, his touch is atrocious, which is a massive skill needed for this system, and his decision making, movement, passing and finishing are all not good enough.

I don't hate Borini at all--I like him. He is rare in that he isn't pushing for a move away and he seems eager to prove himself when often younger players at big clubs can feel entitled to match time. It's his supporters on this sub, who seem to think that no attackers break through via sub appearances (despite the fact that you could argue that Borini himself earned a start against West Ham this year after coming on against Ludogorets and looking dangerous), that only Borini works hard during a game and that refusing to leave when you aren't in the manager's plans is ""loyalty."" Bottom line is that Borini should have to prove that he deserves time on the pitch as much as anyone should, and he simply hasn't done it aside from the aforementioned Ludogorets game and possibly against Sunderland, where he had 4 key passes and an assist, though I still think he didn't play that great (Can had 2 key passes, for context). Clearly BR agrees, seeing as he's benched Mario for ages now, and Lambert has done exactly what Fabio can't (break into the starting XI by performing when subbed on)--as he only had 3 starts in his first 12 appearances before then going on a run of 5 starts in 5 games in all competitions.",null,0,null,1421854712,null,0,false,0,cnw3weg,null,t3_2t290e,null,t1_cnw3weg,null,t1_cnw1soi,null,null,null,1424485292,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

null,false,PhillyScouser,null,null,null,"Moreno is an upgrade from the aging Enrique. What he lacks in defensive prowess he makes up for in pace and tenacity. His attitude fits what LFC is all about.  

Can is going to be a real master in the midfield when he matures. Hell probably be alongside Hendo in the future, and I can't say thats a disappointing prospect at all. His flashes of technique and vision, coupled with his powerful runs and physicality remind me of a young Cambiasso. 

Lallana is a great attacking midfield option for the club. He's not world class by any means, but he is a skilled and creative player with a direct approach to goal. I was worried about this being an overpriced English signing, but his ethic and technical ability have proved his price tag worthy.

Balo/Manquillo are champions league signings. When you play at the highest level of European competition, you need to have a striker who can provide world class, unstoppable goals (which Balo is capable of, even if his form this year says otherwise). You also need speed at the RB/LB positions, especially if you are playing 4 at the back (which was our preferred strategy until recently) 

Lambert was a depth signing, a way to scratch out some EPL results while in the thick of the champions league fight, which is no longer a reality. 

Lovren looks flat footed and confused. Still an unknown as far as a failed/successful signing. 

Last but not least...

LAZAR MARKOVIC

HE HAS A WIZARD'S NAME FOR GOODNESS SAKE!

Lazar is a world class talent. Mark my words Scousers of Reddit, Sterling and Markovic are the future of this club. When Markovic gets his shooting boots on, get ready for something truly special at Anfield. His prime is still 3-5 years away, but he has it all. I would not go so far as to say he will be a Messi or a Ronaldo, but he has the potential to be a Hazard or Di Maria when his time comes. Best signing of the summer in my opinion.

Since the 80's, due to the lipid hypothesis scare telling everyone they're going to die from a heart attack and issues with high cholesterol (despite our bodies creating and regulating our cholesterol levels itself), we've been told to move over to low fat, high carb diets. This is only part of the problem yes, there are excesses and carb rich products which have made things worse, but you don't need a PHd to join the dots.

All carbs, complex or simple, are digested into simple sugars in our digestive system, less the fibrous starch content (because starch is a carbohydrate also), which makes for your net carbs (total carbs - fiber).

Nobody's telling anyone to go and eat big mac's all day, now you're just being immature and small minded. Eating a more rounded diet like we did before the war, based on natural, un-processed foods and naturally occuring animal fats and oils is a better way to go. Yes you need carbs, but not the minimum 130g/day that the nutritionists recommend. Drinking large volumes of industrially processed fruit juice is not good for your body and is tantamount to drinking a pint of coke.

It's worth remembering that the last time Labour won a Holyrood election was 2003. Their support has been waining for over a decade. Typically they pick up votes in UK elections because of their ""vote SNP, get Tory"" rhetoric, but people know that we're in a unique situation where the SNP will potentially be able to influence the makeup or policies of the next UK government. The slogan (which they've dutifully trotted out again) isn't likely to have the same effect - not to mention that the ""Red Tory"" tag appears to be sticking.

It's also hard to underplay the incredible lack of political intelligence within Scottish Labour. They're not going to win back the voters who delivered a majority SNP government in a PR system by continually referring to Nationalism as a virus, making thinly veiled (or outright) Nazi references, referring to the Scottish parliament as a ""one-man dictatorship"", and so on. 

Also, Jim Murphy appears to be especially reviled by pro-independence voters, so making him leader may not prove to be a vote winner.

It is usually twice daily: there is some research suggesting once daily is fine but that is in papulopustular rosacea not acne vulgaris IIRC. Might be best to check with your pharmacist what the British National Formulary (pharmacy bible) says.

Where are the whiteheads, where you shave, near your hairline? Do not use acid exfoliants at the same time of day as shaving, that is risking irritation and even a light chemical burn. Do you use a sunscreen? Zinc oxide is anti microbial and soothing/ calming so may be beneficial in acne.

That Dermalogica cleansing gel contains a lot of sulphate surfactants and potentially irritating plant extracts, you might switch this to something gentler such as Simple KTS Refreshing Wash Gel or Boots Simply Sensitive.

Moisturiser is preventative so should be applied regularly, once your skin is dry the barrier is compromised (keeps water in, bacteria and irritants out). Even gentle foaming washes and water itself affect the skin's barrier function, ditto shaving.

The Dermalogica Active Moist has various potentially irritating extracts as well as glycols which are penetration enhancers. You might consider CeraVe PM lotion (Amazon) to moisturise: this is lightweight, has ceramides to boost skin barrier function and 4% niacinamide which is the same strength as a prescription acne product (Nicam gel).

1) His interviews and general media handling is dreadful. Not only is it painful to listen to and occasionally ridiculous (e.g. 'if you spend £100M you should be winning the league') but it has a negative effect on acquisition targets as well (Salah, as an example).

2) He's awful at handling players he doesn't rate. His treatment of Downing, Agger, Sakho, Reina, Balotelli (who I don't rate either, admittedly, but still think is getting far too much shit from BR in public) and others has been abysmal.

3) He has no plan whatsoever to integrate young players into the side. So far it's been ship them on loan somewhere, let them rot in the reserves, or simply buy more players on top of them for no particular reason rather than simply giving them a chance.

4) Every season we start badly. Why? Because he keep trying to go back to that nonsense 'control possession' crap in his 300 page playbook that has now been proven not to work 3 times in a row. Why he hasn't figured out yet that passing it around between the center backs is never going to work is well beyond me and I have no faith that if he were still in charge next season he wouldn't try to do it again with the same near-disastrous results. Added to which it's just awful to watch.

5) Transfers. Awful nearly all around bar a couple. Not 100% his fault many would say due to the 'committee' structure, which is why I would do away with that notion as well as it's clearly flawed.

My personal preference moving forward would be a proper, professional, experienced DoF and them selecting a manager they could work with.  I would be content with that manager being Rodgers as I think under the guidance of a good DoF many of his shortcomings could be resolved, but he himself doesn't seem to have the desire to work under those circumstances even though his end goal is to manage a club where he would have to anyway.  I think if he were smart, he would not only accept a DoF but actively be promoting the idea to the owners under the pretense that it turns out a single person trying to coach the first team plus be a manager for a club the size of Liverpool isn't humanly possible (because it really isn't, there are far too many moving parts for one man to deal with).",null,0,null,1421857301,null,0,false,0,cnw5f6f,null,t3_2t6i7e,null,t1_cnw5f6f,null,t1_cnw53hh,null,null,null,1424484582,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

You are certainly a very special kind of stupid aren't you?

Were you professionally trained to be that stupid, or is it congenital?

If you were told to attend one of these interviews where *exactly* would you find the additional money for your ""scouting expeditions""? As you would have to be on benefits, which if you hadn't noticed is the bear minimum income, no allowance is paid for ""scouting"" ...

 ... Indeed the Minister brags benefits are deliberately set that low to *force* people off benefits and into work; which (by way of the Minister's selective myopia and total lack if consideration and care for those affected) condemns to a lifetime of grinding poverty those with no realistic prospect of ever working (for instance those with long-term mental health problems or people with CFS/ME etc).

... And (I *have* to ask....) how *exactly* would you ""scout"" the first floor of a building with no lift/ramp access *in a wheelchair*?

Bearing in mind the premises are private and you'd be denied access without a valid appointment, you would be unable to get through the door.

If a person is sent an appointment to investigate their disability I'd suggest the responsibility for the suitability of the venue for that appointment lies with those setting the appointment (in this case Atos) *not* with those being told to attend, clearly legal duty of care/due diligence issues abound otherwise.

My you *really* thought *that* post through didn't you?

Or perhaps you didn't, and now look a completely uncaring, heartless cunt, with little or no understanding of how the world *really* is for the disabled in a society that holds them responsible at least in part, for what amounts to the gambling debts of the banking elite.

Yesterday I told some Arsenal fans to fuck off on back to their own sub. This snowballed into a dozen or more of them coming over here and downvoting just about everything in a thread about Carl Jenkinson. They called us (and me in particular) salty and entitled for not thinking Jenkinson was worth 12M. He isn't worth 12 million and anyone who's watched West Ham this season knows as much. But don't tell that to an Arsenal fan because he'll just say you're acting entitled. Never mind that they'll say this while already talking about Reid as if he's a done deal and already wearing Arsenal red and white.

Are there some Arsenal fans with good, reasonable opinions? Yes. Most of the Arsenal fans I've met in person are nice and know their soccer. But their online presence is unbearable. They are ill informed, they are entitled, and they think their shit don't stink. It annoys me to no end to have to read a new thread every other day asking us ""how's Jenks doing"" or ""whether or not Reid would start for Arsenal"".

Look, most of you around here know me well enough by now to know that I'm not exactly here to make friends. I can be crass, I can be difficult, I can be downright unpleasant. I'm stubborn and opinionated. I have a damn dirty mouth. Most of this is because I really couldn't care less if people on reddit like me or not. That said, I'm typically cordial and polite to most everyone I come across...except the annoying fucking Gooners who come to our board every other day (and people defending Joel Campbell, who plays, coincidentally, for Arsenal).

Considering you did nothing wrong, invited discussion and such, you'll only get upvotes from me. If you want my opinion on him, he's been hyped up by the Jenko-Banter-LADs and the fact we've gone about 8 years without having a good pair of fullbacks. Cresswell's been undoubtably better than Jenko, but that says more about how good the Aarpn's done. His crossing and defending isn't as consistent as you lot seem to think, but he's a great athlete - which is vital for a modern day fullback. I'd say he's worth about £6-8m.

A good example of a similar situation would be one I found myself in in corporate land.  My VP moved on and a replacement was needed.  I myself felt that was unnecessary for obvious reasons, but it was clear politically within the company that I wasn't going to get the job (a bit too young and inexperienced at the time to make a solid case for myself, simply the way it is in larger companies).  I initially fought the idea until one of my mentors told me 'I could be part of the problem or part of the solution' and I think (again, 100% my opinion) is that Rodgers is viewed at the moment by the owners as part of the problem.  

Turning myself into part of the solution instead, I was able to actually help interview candidates and provide guidance, thus ensuring I got a boss I could work with and we now have a great working relationship.  

I guess I just see Rodgers as being in a similar situation- I've always thought he was a bit over his head in terms of experience as honestly he's not really been around so long and his style of management is not like say a Ferguson where he delegates coaching to his staff as he's very hands on on the training ground.  Sadly, that leaves little time for dealing with the myriad of other things he also has to do- checking in with loaned players, scouting assessments, dealing with personnel situations, evaluating the youngsters, etc, etc.  

It's an awful lot of work for a club with well over 500 employees and £200M+ in annual revenue and I don't think many (if any) would be fully up to the task so, I like I said, I do think the idea of a a good DoF Brendan could work with (if he were so inclined, which I don't believe he would be) would be to the benefit of the club as it would provide that experienced hand I think we need to help coordinate all of these additional activities.

The government itself says that you cannot/should not be forced off benefits and into work if you would be financially worse off in doing so. As for morally indefensible, where is your compassion? do you really think it's the disabled and unemployed who wrecked the economy? Don't be so naive.

FWIW: The telephone numbers given out by the benefits agency are these days for call-centres, not the offices concerned, and your telephone enquiry would be met with a perfunctory ""If you don't attend the interview/appointment your benefits could/will be affected"" and your 20p would be gone, wasted (if indeed it lasted the time you'd have been kept on hold waiting to speak to a bored and completely disinterested telephone operator on minimum wage at a DWP call centre).

&gt;Yesterday I told some Arsenal fans to fuck off on back to their own sub.

They called us (and me in particular) salty and entitled for not thinking Jenkinson was worth 12M. He isn't worth 12 million and anyone who's watched West Ham this season knows as much. But don't tell that to an Arsenal fan because he'll just say you're acting entitled. Never mind that they'll say this while already talking about Reid as if he's a done deal and already wearing Arsenal red and white.

They are ill informed, they are entitled, and they think their shit don't stink.

null,false,ggow,null,null,null,"Here's how the devolved budget is calculated for Scotland:

When Barnett was introduced, there first year was taking as the baseline. This baseline goes back to the Goschen formula, which assumed a fixed ratio of the population, at 11%. 

Each year, an incremental adjustment is made to the baseline (either up or down) taking in to account the changes to spending *in England*. The cash value of that change is taken, and adjusted for the different populations, and the **exact same** per capita amount is added to the baseline i.e. a £100 per capita spending increase leads to a £100 per capita increase in Scotland's budget, under the assumption that the two budgets are directly comparable. (a multiplier - between 0 and 1 - is used if they are not). 

The following year, a new baseline is taken. That baseline is comprised of the previous baseline **plus** the increment. The process then starts over again and a new increment is added. 

There are three important takeaways from this. 

The first is that, all else being equal, spending levels between the other three home nations should converge on spending levels in England. That it hasn't is due to extra spending being allocated over the years and divergent population growth rates, with England growing faster. 

The second is that most of the additional spending comes from the baseline being inflated by historically out of date population ratios. Scotland's share of the population has declined since the 70s, but the early increments (calculated based on a higher share) are still a part of the baseline. Those, however,become less important as a consequence of inflation eroding their real-terms worth. 

The third take away - and most pertinent here - is that any decision which affect spending levels in England, or 'England and Wales' automatically gets put through an algorithm and affects the levels of spending in Scotland. As such, there is very little that can be said to be an English-only law. If pure EVEL is pursued, and all else remaining equal, it will be completely neutered by the fact that it will only apply in a select few situations.

I think Andrew Neil did a pretty funny piece on it, comparing Murphys egging to the various other eggings he knows about to try and determine which was the most merciless. 

That didn't earn him any favours with people outside the Labour party, it just made a lot of people (even moderates) take a dislike to him.

null,false,podpool3,null,null,null,"&gt; Good results now don't mitigate half a season of poor decisions

What about the whole of last season or have you forgotten that? He almost won us the league, no manager for 20 odd years has come as close. Yes we had Suarez, but even still it takes a certain amount of man management to get him playing at his best and get other players around him playing for Suarez. The start of this season we bought a lot of players, players need time. We lost a massive amount of goals in Suarez and Sturridge. Any team in our financial position would suffer without those two and a mass of new players bedding in. We can't afford to sign players who are at the top of their game and have very little need to adapt to the league ie/ Costa/Fabregas. Sanchez would have been great but he chose London over Liverpool - hardly something BR can control.

1) Personally I do not mind his interviews, they are mostly generic run of the mill typical manager spiel, that most managers come out with. He talks about the team; if we've played well he lauds, if we play poorly he'll say so. Sometimes there are occasions I think 'you're talking shite BR,' but thats the same with all managers. Look at Mourinho last night, 'we had chances, a draw was fair' etc. With regard to Salah, where is he now? What is he doing? Not even featuring on the bench for Chelsea thats where. He'll end up like Moses, being farmed out on loan to every fucker who wants him eventually. The grass isn't always greener as they say and Salah is experiencing that now. He could have joined us and actually played and got game time. Its his loss. We moved on and he isn't playing games, something thats detrimental to his own development. Fuck Salah.

2) Here you may have a point, however he is the head coach. He has the prerogative to play the players he wants, to get rid of the players he wants. I don't really believe he has mistreated anyone? Sakho broke the rules, left the ground early instead of supporting his peers, his team. He duly got fined, I'm sure the majority of managers would do the same. Over the past 5-6 weeks he's played and is doing well. The other players I don't really know what you are getting at? Didnt Agger admit once he left he had physical problems with the game, he couldn't manage the ferocity and pace of the premier league, something like that? Anyway I do admit there were some problems with Agger and BR and I was gutted to see Agger go. However once again, managers over time having fallings out with their players or even star players; Whiskey nose and Beckham/Keane/Cantona etc.

3) Thats just bollocks I'm afraid. If anyone gives youth a chance its BR. Look at Sterling, Ibe, Flano, Kelly (before he got injured), he gives the ones that can make the step up a chance. Only a couple of players are ever good enough to come through into the first team. In fact its one criticism I have of BR its his signing of youngsters in the transfer market rather than established experienced players. The balance is too much in favour of youth. Sheyi Ojo got a chance recently, being on the bench for the first team, he does give our own youth a chance, to say otherwise is false.

4) This 300 page 'playbook' almost won us the league last season. We played some of the best football I have ever witnessed last season and its coming to fruition again. Passing it around the Centre backs works for all top teams, watch the way Chelsea, Barca, Bayern, Real play. They have ball playing centre backs and play from the back. We might not quite be as good at it as those teams, but its definitely the way to play. I agree it is awful to watch if we don't go anywhere with it (such as at the start of this season) however when we are on our game it works extremely well and is a joy to watch.

5) Agree. There has been some hit and miss transfers. And I would definitely fuck off this committee bollocks, I'm totally against it. BR should be allowed to sign who the fuck he wants; live by the sword and die by it so to speak. I would say Can, Lallana, Markovic, Moreno, Studge, Coutinho have all been excellent buy's though and with the former players, they are starting to show their potential. Balotelli/Lovren - maybe not so. But for Lovren he has time on his side - at the moment both look expensive flops. Balo a daft risk, which again I don't think was a BR signing anyway.

You make some ok points and at least have basis for your argument for wanting BR out, however I could not disagree any more with you about him going. BR is the man for us, I like his ideas, his football philosophy and the identity he's given the team.

Markovic - big price tag, big potential, too young, can't judge. I'll look back on this one in 3 years and let you know.

Can - looks like a decent player. Fairly limited going forward, not quite a CB. Versatility is good, but don't see him become a team leader anytime soon. Decent purchase all in all. 

Lallana - I love this guy. He's absolute quality. Been injured too frequently to have consistent run in the team, but I'm looking forward to when he does. I think 25m is a big price tag, but its mitigated by his lower wages, and I'm happy with him. He's also probably my favorite player to watch on the team. 

Balo - Absolute tosser. Doesn't fit our system, refuses to put in the effort, acts like he's 13, and I genuinely doubt whether he has the quality because we've seen none of it so far. Our team is better when he doesn't play. If he's not sold this summer, barring a massive turn around, I'd be furious. 

Manquillo - Meh. He's not good enough yet, but he's young, on loan, and cover. No qualms, but also not chuffed about it.

Lovren - He's been horrific at times, but I think he'll figure it out. This seasons going to be a whitewash, but he'll come good I think. 

Lambert - 4m. Scouse. Loves the club, great energy, and puts in a decent shift. Decent quality.

It could alternatively be argued Rodgers didn't win us the league when a more experienced/senior manager might have, but that's all idle speculation and admittedly not provable in any way, shape, or form.  Overall, Rodgers gets credit for 2nd and fair enough, but he also has to subsequently take the bad of the first half of this season then which has perhaps cost us a spot in the CL next season.

1)  I don't begrudge his more generic interviews as they are, as you say, what all managers do.  What I don't like is him throwing Balotelli, as an example, under the bus.  I don't rate Mario at all, but he still doesn't deserve to have his manager say in public some of the things Brendan has said and the same has been true for others players in the past (e.g. Downing 'not working hard enough').  If he has an issue with his players, talk to the players, not the press, about it.  With respect to Salah, one of the reasons he didn't come to Liverpool, aside from the lack of a suitable bid, was there were some accounts that statements made to the press about Salah pissed him off.  I don't recall the specific line, but BR said something about him not being proven or words to that effect.  I also don't like when he spouts out rubbish which eventually comes back to biting him in the ass (spending £100M and you should win the league).  Overall, I just think he needs to talk to the press less, not more, and should avoid talking about specific players unless it's to praise them.  He's very naive and doesn't seem to have learned quite yet that the press is not his friend.

2)  For Agger, he was pissed at he didn't feel BR was honest with him and he himself said as much.  Sakho was pissed because he was replaced by Lovren (for awhile at least).  Downing was pissed because he didn't feel BR was honest with him.  Suso, Assaidi- similar situations with a lack of communication from the manager to the players.  Again, I suspect part of this is because he simply doesn't have the time he probably should have for one on ones with players so it's not perhaps entirely his fault.  Overall, I'd say his man management of those he likes is good, for others it's pretty poor and the problem that arises from that is pissed off players don't tend to play super well when you need them.

3)  Sterling was given a chance, but only due to injuries, not because there was a plan for it.  Ibe hasn't really been given one as of yet, Flanagan and Kelly got theirs under Kenny.  Look at Teixeira- played well one game last year, hasn't been seen since.  Rossiter- scores in his debut and hasn't left the bench since.  We loaned out Suso for some reason, bought Alberto who is a similar player on top of him.  I agree with incoming transfers being, on average, too young, which is part of the problem as it is effectively replacing our own kids with others kids who we had to pay for and that's one of the things I don't like.  I am hoping having Inglethorpe promoted as of November will help as he has said he is committed to helping map out the Academy's kids playing careers, but thus far I can't see our handling of our youth as anything much more than dreadful.

4)  I would argue the 300 page playbook went out the window when we went to two up top.  That's pretty well not a Rodgers strategy and in came after discussion BR had with Bielsa at a seminar he was attending where Bielsa was one of the speakers.  Not perhaps coincidentally, the style of play was far more similar to Bielsa than anything BR has ever used previously.  Credit to BR for making the change I suppose, not sure he deserves as much credit for it being in his manifesto.  There is passing it back to go forward, then there is aimlessly passing it about the back to maintain possession, and, for me, we did far, far too much of the latter and I do believe that is a principle put in place by BR albeit subsequently abandoned as it simply doesn't work.  Couple of quotes from Cruyff come to mind on this topic:

""Letting the defense do the build-up leads to endless horizontal passing, and the ball will eventually end up with the goalie. In the meantime the opposition gets all the time needed to organize themselves.  A team that passes the ball around in its own defense is doomed. You must pass the ball to midfield, as soon as possible because that’s where your best players are, and then the whole defense will be behind the ball.  Playing the ball back to the goalie doesn’t count as ball possession.""

I would content for the first half of this season and the first games after Rodgers' appointment, we were well guilty of breaking near all of these 'rules' and largely by Rodgers' design.

5)  Guess we can at least agree on the committee being a terrible idea, although we may disagree on the best way to fix the issue going forward ;-)

Thanks for the proper discussion, there's too little of this on here for me and it is appreciated.

A better example is celebrities, like Cheryl Cole or Wayne Rooney, who might be labelled 'chavs' - which Owen Jones argues is being used to negatively portray the working classes - because of how they behave, what they do with their money, i.e. being fast and lose with it etc.

That's just a brief example of how the lines are blurred these days. Partly because we don't all identify based on our employment any more. There divisions aren't clear. There is much more emphasis on consumption, having the ability to consume and doing it in the correct way is more valuable to society than other factors these days.  So if someone with money doesn't consume as society expects, and behaves more ""working class"" or ""chav"" etc, then they are devalued because of it.

The same happens the other way, people with little money, but using credit to consume in a way that is particularly middle class. Buying a nicer car, joining gold clubs etc. That obviously causes more problems and ultimately the whole credit crunch thing happened.

 [**Maxwellisation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwellisation): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Maxwellisation__ is a procedure in [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) governance where individuals due to be criticised in an official report are sent details of the criticism in advance and permitted to respond prior to publication.

&gt;The process takes its name from the newspaper owner [Robert Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Maxwell). In 1969, Maxwell was criticised in a report by the [Department of Trade and Industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Trade_and_Industry_(United_Kingdom\)) as ""unfit to hold the stewardship of a public company"". Maxwell took the matter to court where the DTI were said by the Judge to have ""virtually committed the business murder"" of Maxwell. 

&gt;To avoid any repeat of Justice Forbes' ruling, official policy was altered to ensure prior notice would be given of critical findings in advance. Relevant witnesses are shown the specific extracts of reports relating to them.

And that's because cutting alone doesn't generate growth and that's why the national debt hasn't shrunk and is actually larger than it was before the cuts. 

The government actually conceded failure on austerity in 2013 when it told us austerity was needed until 2018 (and then forever) to eliminate the deficit. 

If cutting was ever going to work, we should have had most of the deficit eliminated by then and the national debt should have been falling by then. None of that happened.

Long chain omega-3s are both potent anti inflammatories and used in skin cell membranes, oily fish is also a great source of skin friendly B vitamins. Canned oily fish is very convenient: sardines/ pilchards, mackerel, pink salmon but not tuna (loses the oils in the canning process). Other sources of healthy fats include whole eggs, walnuts and seeds like pumpkin and chia.

Inflammatory foods include sugar, refined/ processed/ high glycaemic index carbs, most omega-6s (in grains, nuts, some seeds), excess caffeine, alcohol. Official guidelines are *maximum* 10% daily calories as sugar added/ fat added/ junky stuff which is a really small serving. This does include many breakfast cereals unfortunately.

""Scotland's economic growth slows"" - you say there that ""the article shows that it actually grew"" as if this is somehow opposed to the headline. The headline states that its GROWTH is slowing, ie growing at a lower rate than previously. But still growing! I have absolutely no idea why you think that is misleading.

""Scotland's jobless total rises by 7000"" - regardless of whether employment rose by 1000, of the 8000 net increase in additional working age adults, 7000 of them have not been in work and 1000 have been in work. 

For this reason, it would have been misleading to say ""Number of people working in Scotland has increased by 1000"", despite that being true, because it would mask the fact that actually there has been a 7 times larger increase in the unemployed.

I'm assuming you're a bitter Yes voter complaining about BBC bias painting a bleak picture to make Scotland seem like it needs the union to survive. I am Scottish, and I voted Yes, but morons like you twisting things, either deliberately or through your own bitter stupidity really meant that I couldn't get behind the mainstream campaigners.

And secondly, I'm pretty happy with this. Cuadrado is lightning quick, a great dribbler like many of our existing AMs, but is much more accomplished at being direct and taking defenders on than most of ours who I often think try to walk it in too much. It will certainly provide a *different* angle of attack for us, if our normal approach doesn't work.

A definite upgrade on Salah who, whilst still being very young, seems to have the end product of a leprous amputee and who Chelsea can't afford to blindly persist with in the hopes he'll magically get better. I wouldn't be too averse to loaning him out for a season and seeing how he does, but I have a sneaking suspicion he'll never reach Chelsea quality.

As for Schurrle, I'll feel slightly sad to see him go. Whilst I believe Cuadrado to be better in most aspects - there were certainly glimpses over the last year to suggest Schurrle really could (and to be fair still could) become one of the best wingers in world football, but he's far too inconsistent and seems to only find form off the bench. All too often this season, he's been far too shot happy in games and consistently wildly blazed the ball wide or over, or straight at the keeper, ruining many of our attacks.

In the event that both Schurrle and Salah go, do you guys think we'd need another winger/number 10 to make up the numbers?

Wrapping all over in solid colour then putting more vinyl over the top, then lacquering over the top simply won't hold, especially over the air scoops on the fairing.  Go this route and You're going to have ugly seams at the points beyond the strech capability.

The best way to achieve your desired result would be to get the bike painted in the background colour you want with a couple of coats of lacquer. Then get coloured vinyl cut to your designs fitted, then get the paint shop to lacquer over the 1 layer of vinyl. Much safer and will look the best by far.

Get paint shop in charge rather than a sign shop otherwise you'll be disappointed.

* Seems like Hugo isn't at the squad at all. I'm guessing it's just to give Friedel some potential playing time, but could there be a chance for a potential injury?

* I feel like getting Vlad and Fazio back soon could be important. The team that we've set up now works, but another injury to Walker could be real bad with Vlad injured and Naughton going to Swansea. Is Yedlin registered to play if neccessary?

* Glad to see Mason in the squad again. Hope he can put in a good performance. Mason/Stambouli could be a good partnership. 

* Not that surprised at the Adebayor start, since we saw him do decently as a sub against Sunderland. I'm wondering how we'll be playing against Leicester though. Since Chadli is presumably still out I'm guessing Soldado will get the chance together with Kane.

* I'd believe Moussa, Paulinho and Soldado get the sub appearances. We could see Lennon if we need width, but I'm not sure whether Poch rates him.

The highlands is generally thought of as the bit North of Inverness in the East, and Fort William in the West. If it was me, I'd concentrate on the West coast North of Loch Lomond, because it feels like the highlands but with much less driving. 

I also agree train/bus is the way to do it over 3 days, I'd go Edinburgh, Glasgow, Oban, Fort William, Inverness, Aviemore, Edinburgh. 

Can't reiterate enough as well (my OH mods TripAdvisor) that you really shouldn't underestimate how much time it takes to drive around Scotland. The motorways finish just north of Edinburgh in the East, Glasgow in the West and Stirling in the middle. After 
that it's a mix of mainly single carriageway, dual carriageway (not a lot though) and single track roads once you're in the actual highlands. 

tl;dr unless you chance on a generous redditor that owns a mini-bus, do public transport. 

Edit: probably best to forget Skye, to do it any justice it takes a few days on its own

There are loads of castles and similar throughout the UK, though East Anglia tends to be fairly castle-free -- England's borders with Scotland and Wales tend to have the best castles, as these were areas which actually needed defending.

Nonetheless, you will be able to visit some excellent castles relatively easier (and since the UK is so much smaller than th e states, it's much easier to travel ""across the country"" to visit a castle.

There are still some relatively local ones which are worth visiting, however:

The Tower of London is excellent, and there's lots of other stuff to do in London, much of it kid-friendly (the various free museums, esp. the Natural History and  Science, but also the British and Victoria and Albert museums). I remember going to Hedingham Castle in Essex quite a lot as a child. The keep is intact, and there were often historical re-enactment things going on, as I recall. The walls of Framlingham castle in Suffolk are fairly well preserved. The keep of Orford Castle, also Suffolk, remains intact, and is of an extremely unusual octagonal design.

Further afield, the Welsh and Marcher (that is, on the Welsh-English border) castles tend to be your best bet for density of good castles. Caernarvon, Caerphilly, and Beaumaris are all famous, extensive, and well-preserved.

There are also various country houses, often worth visiting. Chatsworth (Derbyshire) is deservedly famous, Kentwell Hall (Suffolk) deserves an honourable mention for the sole reason that on Easter weekends it hosts a fiendish quiz/treasurehunt through the house and grounds (and, for children, one which has actually soluble questions...)

Labour is centre-left although historically, it has been always left wing until recently. Their policies favour individuals rather than businesses.

Conservatives are centre-right. They're very pro-business, a lot of their policies involve benefiting businesses in some way. 

Liberal Democrats are basically somewhere in the middle between Labour and Conservatives but they lean little bit more to left and their policies favour young people and the EU more than any of other parties. They're disliked because they promised something very important to a large proportion of LibDem voters then broke it. It's not well known that Lib Dem had no control in keeping their promise.

UKIP is anti-immigration and anti-EU party. They are also very right wing, and favours businesses more than any of other main parties. They are populist in a sense that they rely on populism a lot -- not much is known about their policies in more obscure matters. UKIP is disliked by many because many of their supporters are racists and some of their policies do not really make a sense even though it appeals to many.

Green Party is a mix of Liberal Democrats and Labour but way more left-wing.

ill be honest here, the CBT is ment to take you from cant ride a push bike to being able to ride a geared bike on your own, with no supervision in a few hours. its alot to take in and often its simply to much. So dont feel bad in the slightest. and unless the bike was an insurance write off them someone will have done much worse than you.

Should you go geared or twist and go?
what do you want to get from the CBT, if you want to buy a geared 125 then re book the CBT for a geared bike, if you would be happy on a twist and go do it on a 50cc scooter.

I had a similar convo with my brother, my thinking is, your going to be much better off learning from a qualified bike instructor than you will be trying to teach yourself or have a mate teach you. and probably significantly safer.

dont let it put you off, most people with a bike licence will have failed one of the stages, its not easy and thats the point, but i promise you its worth it

null,false,lovechip,null,null,null,"The main thing you need to understand in the UK is the difference between left and right wing politics. 

Left wing tends to be more liberal ideas, encouraging a more even distribution of wealth, compassionate, for the masses rather than business and wealthy individuals, maybe concern for the environment, in favour of public services. The far left of this is communism or socialism.

Right wing (and I'll try to be unbiased here because I am most definitely left wing) is more about people being out for themselves, if you earn it, you get to keep it, lower taxes, they feel that if you work hard you get what you deserve and if you don't then it's your own fault if you're suffering, they're more keen on private enterprise, capitalism. The far right of this is facism, which is all bound up with racism, nazism, etc. 

The extremes of right and left wing, when taken to the nth degree end up being basically the same... shit!

British politics is roughly in the centre so there's less between the parties. UKIP is the most far right, popular party, then the conservatives are centre-right, labour is centre-left, then the Lib Dems are more left and the Greens are even further left.

UKIP's major bug bear is us being in the EU. Every other week they're getting members who have been done for racism, sexism, etc, some of the footage on youtube of members of that party speaking is diabolical.

The conservatives main thing is cutting the deficit by cutting public spending. It's highly controversial and even though it sounds like a simple solution, it really, really is not. They have done some good things like legalising gay marriage, but generally, they are right wing, so their agenda is still fairly lacking in understanding and compassion and panders to the elderly and people living in the countryside who, sorry to say, tend to have more outdated views, but they tend to vote much more than young people!

Labour have made some massive errors when they were previously in power, but, for how much ed miliband is mocked, he is actually a pretty impressive person when you find out about his background. I actually quite like him. Their policies are a little hazy, but i think that's due to poor reporting in the media, since a lot of the mainstream media is right wing and supportive of the conservatives. Generally though, they will be in favour of the wealthiest people bearing the brunt of the consequences of the recession and economic issues and be getting them to help with funding public services. People either view this as a fair thing, since good public services will create a better society and if you're lucky to have profited in society you should contribute to the society that has enabled your financial success. Or people think the wealthy have just worked hard (as if poor people in work aren't working hard!) and deserve to keep everything they earn.

Lib dems have had some great policies which is why everyone was so won over by them in the last election (shame they then went into coalition with a right wing party... makes NO sense, except you could say they have managed to tamper what the conservatives could get away with). They are again in favour of fairly distributing wealth, strongly in favour of public services, even free university tuition although they weren't able to follow through on that in coalition.

The greens are very long-term thinking and have some fairly radical policies to tackle climate change, animal welfare, sustainable living and are quite brave in putting this out there since it's stuff that even makes me quiver a bit, thinking, but i just want everything to carry on as it is and shove the human race into an early grave haha. They're really gaining ground at the moment as people on the left are pushed further left after being let down by the lib dems and in response to all the attention UKIP is getting. They will probably do quite well in the elections. 

Hope this is a good start for you! The easiest way to decide on a party is to go generally in the direction (right or left) that you agree with. I think there are quizzes online that can help you decide if you're right or left wing. Then just decide to what degree you are left or right. I know most people vote by the look of a party, the short soundbites you hear, so I see no problem with you doing the same!!

I don't think the political spectrum has changed much since 2010, we still have 2 big parties, 1 small party and some protest parties. Today Green and UKIP, then it was BNP and Ecology.

AV with a small constituency is pointless, we need larger areas, returning many MP's. Perhaps we could use AV+ A big hint to the politicians, go and read The Jenkins Report 1999.

Personally as a Labour campaigner I like FPTP, it means we only have a limited number of key seats. Using FPTP most seats are red, yellow or blue. The other seats, the marginals are the important seats. With AV or any other proportional system ""every vote counts"". That means every voter in every house will need to be contacted, we don't have the resources to knock on every door.

The problem is, as an out-and-out striker, Rom is the only one option (the other being Eto'o, who has serious fitness constraints). This causes the fans to turn to him as the sole finisher.

There is a very particular demographic in my current area, it's limited to mainly white working class. There's a tiny bit of diversity, but it's not a big place. I work a 7 day week and have done the last couple years, so I don't get out much, and if I do it's somewhere far away from England. But I did move from a couple larger English cities a couple years ago, and multiple worldwide cities before then (few in africa, few in us) , so I get the whole diversity thing. 

 I don't think being Muslim or Christian is really a gender thing. Seems to be more of a culture you were born into sort of thing. All religions are.

 I've visited friends out here in the country, they are also in my age group and of similar mind, so yes we all think alike I guess (to be fair, I do get along better with other people who comprehend the silliness of things like religion). 

Recently I traveled to Poland, a very deeply religious country, for the holidays, and everyone in my age group (including random people that I didn't know) also shared the sentiment. Men and women of the older generation there are still very traditional, but millennials were just like everywhere else I've been - mostly non religious. 

Like I said... generation gap and education have more to do with it than gender.  I do, however, choose friends who are maybe the slightly brighter crayons. Honestly England seems well educated overall, and it has a spectacular rate of common sense in comparison to other places I've been. Probably explains why the overall rate rate of non-religion is sky high here. Unless you wish to argue that's because there's more men than women in England...

&gt;__Joseph Carey Merrick__ (5 August 1862 – 11 April 1890), sometimes incorrectly referred to as __John Merrick__, was an English man with severe deformities who was exhibited as a [human curiosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freak_show) named the __Elephant Man__. He became well known in London society after he went to live at the [London Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_London_Hospital). Merrick was born in [Leicester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester), [Leicestershire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicestershire) and began to develop abnormally during the first few years of his life. His skin appeared thick and lumpy, he developed an enlargement of his lips, and a bony lump grew on his forehead. One of his arms and both feet became enlarged and at some point during his childhood he fell and damaged his hip, resulting in permanent lameness. When he was 10, his mother died and his father soon remarried. Merrick left school at 13, and had difficulty finding employment. Rejected by his father and stepmother, he left home. In late 1879, aged 17, Merrick entered the Leicester Union [Workhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workhouse).
