null,false,sirtetris,flair8,,null,"2 reactions:

**(1)** Lamela had a bit of a bright spot at the beginning of the season, and has been mostly downhill since then. In contrast, Coutinho hadn't really started to shine until the second half of the season, and is much more in form at the moment. I think that skews the perception of ""who's better."" Yes, surely over the full season Coutinho has been better, but I think that's exaggerated because people pay more attention to recent form (which must have contributed to his TOTY position in the first place).

**(2)** and more relevantly: this showing that ""stats are meaningless.""

Yes, the stats say that they've performed comparably when it comes to setting up goals. But is that not one of Lamela's strong suits? We know he can contribute the odd assist even when he's playing terribly otherwise (see: Newcastle). It's not a case of ""stats are meaningless"", it's a case of just one statistic not capturing the bigger picture.

For example, Lamela is dispossessed 3.2 times per 90 minutes. Coutinho is at 2.1 (which isn't bad for someone who dribbles a lot - for comparison, Eriksen is at 2.5). Coutinho successfully dribbles past a defender 3.5 times per 90 (7th highest in the league), while Lamela does so 2.3 times (24th). Coutinho plays 64% of his passes forwards, while Lamela's forward passes account for only 48% of his total.

There is a metric by which Lamela's doing comparably to Coutinho. That's not misleading – he HAS DONE just as well at setting up shots. And it's hard to deny, even just by watching the games, that he's been more tenacious in defense. But there are also many metrics that suggest he's worse in other departments, such as not giving the ball up, or his ability to turn and advance the play forward. Just because someone's good at one aspect of the game doesn't imply that they're good at everything, and it surely doesn't imply that they're a ""better player"" overall.",null,0,null,1430504306,null,0,false,0,cqv94oc,null,t3_34iz5r,null,t1_cqv94oc,null,t3_34iz5r,null,null,null,1432716907,null,13,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,13,null

Well done by the judge. From what I know, a judge can't ever excuse murder or manslaughter whatever the situation - even in the case of assisted suicide. It's a simple matter of law - assisted suicide is not legal, no matter how much we might like it to be. You aren't allowed to kill someone - murder is murder.

I think in this case that the judge made the best call.

It took time and money, i did most of the work myself and saved a fortune. The house is now worth £20,000 more than i bought it for with only £3,000 work done.

What im trying to say, is that if you have spare time, spare money and an eagerness to learn and do a good job it could be a great investment for you. But you have to be hands on.

I loved every minute of the time i spent on it. I am about to buy another property in the next couple of weeks ( viewing tomorrow). I wish i was fortunate enough to have been born into a wealthy family as it is my dream life atm.

null,false,AmbiguousP,null,null,null,"Okay, so the reason that you can't just say ""LGB is good enough and covers everyone"" is because it doesn't. Transgender, Intersex, and Queer / Questioning (Both of which are used as the ""Q"" variously) are very different things, primarily because none of them (with the exception of Questioning, which covers a whole range of stuff) are to do with sexuality at all.

* Transgender is about gender identity, which is entirely separate from sexuality. This is about who people *are*, not who they *like*.
* Intersex is about a set of medical conditions where a person's sex is ambiguous. This is again not to do with sexuality, but instead a person's identity and reconciling that with a body which is (wrongfully) considered ""abnormal"" by our society.
* Queer is generally used as a coverall term for sexual *and* gender minorities who do not fall into the other ""major"" groups. This tends to include pansexual people, those with nonbinary gender, asexual people (not too sure if asexuality tends to be included here very often, actually. If someone more knowledgeable does please let me know), and others. This covers a range of issues both of sexuality *and* gender.
* Questioning, again, can cover issues of both sexuality and gender, and so it would be inaccurate to just consider it covered under ""LGB"".

Aside from the fact that *every one* of the gender and sexual minorities in this country faces unique issues which deserve to be addressed, I think there's a greater point to be made about why the inclusion of T, I, and Q, along with the increasingly common * to include anything not explicitly mentioned, is important:

These movements are about getting representation and understanding for groups which have been thoroughly maligned by society for a long time. Some of the greatest issues that these groups have faced are erasure and misunderstanding. The number of lesbians and bisexual people who have been told that their sexuality is nothing more than their own personal confusion or attention seeking is huge. Transgender people are frequently informed that they don't really exist, or have their gender identity inextricably linked to sexuality. Many people still don't even know what ""intersex"" is! 

To remove the express representation and agency of these minorities is antithetical to the entire purpose of the movement: to ensure that sexual and gender minorities are able to be properly understood, represented, and accepted in our society. If wanting to maintain this push towards equality and representation for all is ""insane"", according to you, then I'm not sure I want to know what ""sanity"" would look like.

*Addendum: I'm a middleclass, white, straight, cisman. I realise that I'm about as far from a minority of any sort in this context as you can be, and I have no desire to seem like I'm speaking on behalf of others when they're perfectly capable of speaking for themselves.

He literally said Balotelli (along with our other strikers) is an ineffective forward, but not only does he not produce for himself, he also makes it harder on the other players.

""Up until six or seven weeks ago he didn't have that ability to make the threaded pass through.

null,false,Colonel_Blimp,null,null,null,"First off this is an incredibly loaded question - foreign policy isn't just about Iraq or Afghanistan, and the idea of complete disengagement from the international scene or any intervention being bad isn't helpful at all. 

Nevertheless, my answer would be probably the Green party, but that doesn't necessarily reflect well on them because if they got anywhere near power it would be an utter disaster for us in international relations. They don't care about foreign policy beyond vague promises of peace and happiness and they are willing to lie about the cost of Trident. But what about the parties in general?

In general, that there isn't enough votes in defence and foreign policy and the Tories don't want to discuss foreign policy because they have presided over a bad period for our country in the international stage. They've really buggered it big time.

Moreover, no party wants to admit that its leader would likely be a foreign policy lightweight and has no intention of doing much about it, bar perhaps the left wing trying to re-engage us with the EU. 

And finally, I'm pretty convinced on what I've seen recently that none of the parties are credible when it comes to formulating policy on foreign affairs or defence. The Conservatives have overseen calamitous and poorly thought out cuts thanks to their obsession with small government and austerity, Labour are probably the best choice but they don't dare talk foreign policy because morons just go ""BUT IRAQ!!1one!"", the Lib Dems support foreign aid but are pretty indifferent otherwise and none of UKIP, the SNP or the Greens have a foreign policy outlook that isn't pretty laughable.

Absolutely.  How does the average person find out their RDA, for example?  Overshooting by even a couple of hundred calories a day will result in weight gain.  Many things are poorly or inadequately labelled, or contain calories that will contribute to your total intake but will leave you feeling hungry.  Sugar and carbohydrates are the prime candidates here, and we've long been told to avoid satiating fats (but that's another story).

Even knowing your target intake, sticking to it in the face of a landscape saturated with sophisticated marketing of tempting, cheap foods is asking for trouble.

&gt;Yes we have an environment that is very tempting, but that isn't going to change any time soon, so bar the occasional mental condition, it's up to us to act responsible for our own health and monitor this kind of thing.

You admit a problem and still lay the blame on the symptom.  The blame lies in the environment, not the responders to the environment.  People haven't gotten more lazy or less able to control their urges. Weight loss at a population level will only occur if we make changes to the underlying, ubiquitous driving factors.  

&gt;But the coping is much more feasible than the change in the long term.

For a city with two very well regarded universities and a population from across the world, as the oil industry tends to attract, it's also very lacking in terms of arts and amenities.  There never seems to be anything on and the nightlife is reminiscent of a small fishing town.

Some nice areas for sure but the whole place is let down by a roads network that cannot cope with the demands the industry places on it and a severe lack of local pride, presumably because it's just seen as a place to live and make money and not somewhere to actually settle.  Rents are universally high and house prices are inflated by oil salaries.  £350k+ for a 3/4 bedroom within tolerable commuting distance on congested roads has become normal.

Look at Tom Coughlin, Head coach of the New York Giants. Every coach in the league has always said he is a great coach, however his players never followed him. The very first year that he changed himself, made himself available to the players and became personable, the Giants win the Superbowl. Same thing with Ferguson, Mourinho, Popovich (Other Spurs Head Coach), etc... It's a proven formula. 

We will see, but I already feel like he will be gone by the end of next year unless that changes. It makes a world of difference when the players respect and love their coach equally.

A lot of courses are not that hard, but obviously the competitive ones (medicine, vet, economics, architecture, etc.) are much harder to get into because more people want a place on them.

If, let's say, you get AADE this year (seeing as you can't get higher than an A at AS), you can probably persuade them to predict you A\*/A*/C next year and that should get you offers assuming your school reference and personal statement are up to scratch.

If you get in line with your predictions of BBB this year then I think the best you can hope for prediction wise is AAA (which would be enough but universities might be skeptical.

You've also got to think if you can realistically get the grades they're asking for. I know some kids who were originally predicted BBB like you, got it pushed up to AAA for their UCAS application, took offers for AAA/AAB and then got BBB or BBC as predicted and missed out on uni.  

The MP reference is useless as someone else said. You need one from a teacher that says how hard you work and how enthusiastic you are about the subject, that you're a good learner and would be an asset to the university. 

Honestly I think the personal statement and reference are as important as the grades. A quality statement and reference will really push your case. I was predicted A\*/A/C and I got 4 offers from universities that were asking for A\*/A/A. I then got sick during exams and had to redo the year...this time I already had A\*/B and was predicted a further B to give me A\*/B/B but still got 5/5 offers from courses all asking for A\*/A/A (and I had 3 ""reduced offers""). 

GCSEs can help or hinder you to a lesser extent too. I got 5A\*/5A at GCSE and I think that helped convince the universities that I could achieve what they wanted. If yours are average I would guess it won't really sway them, although when put against a similar candidate with better GCSEs you may lose out. 

The thing is there's so many variables right now that we don't know because either you don't know yourself or you haven't specified, that it's hard to say.

If we knew what course you're looking at, what universities in particular, what GCSEs you had and what realistically you think you'll get at both AS and A2 we could probably give you a much clearer answer.

**""Was told before the match that Tottenham were here to watch me.""**

&amp;nbsp;

Talent Kristoffer Ajer (17) is monitored closely by top european clubs.

&amp;nbsp;

Several big clubs are monitoring Starts shooting star Kristoffer Ajer (17) closely. The 17 year old played the entire match against Rosenborg and showed his abilities with a nice goal right before the final whistle.

&amp;nbsp;

In the stands were scouts from a number of Europes elite clubs, says local newspaper Fædrelandsvennen.

&amp;nbsp;


Ajer knew Tottenham were among the clubs watching him.

&amp;nbsp;

 ""I was told before the game they were present to watch me. It made me a bit more nervous, but it's great fun"", says Ajer to the paper (Fædrelandsvennen).

&amp;nbsp;

But Ajer didn't know his favourite club Liverpool also had scouts present at Lerkendal.

&amp;nbsp;

""That's fun and inspiring to know. And it's extra cool that I scored"", says the 17 year old.

&amp;nbsp;

In addition to Liverpool and Tottenham, Arsenal and the German club Hertha Berlin had scouts present.

[](#s ""Honestly, I think the Kill the Moon writer just messed up every one of the characters. 12 was out of character mean, Clara was weirdly ignoring the danger to children on Earth, Courtney went from 'disruptive influence' to complaining about being bored while on the moon as its falling apart.

Look at the way Moffat writes 12 in episodes like Listen where this Doctor isn't sugar coating things but still helping a child deal with fear and compare that too the clumsy way he was written in Kill the Moon.

Honestly I was very disappointed we let Schurrle go when Ramires gets all these minutes out wide ahead of Cuadrado. I'm sure Cuadrado could do a similar jon since he has all the physical and technical qualities to succeed. Maybe lacking on the tactical side but that's something I'm sure the coaching staff have been impressing on him these last few months.

The Third Doctor said that he would return it as soon as possible but absconds with it.

There are the two references to the Terrible Zodin in the television show first in the Five Doctors (by the Second Doctor) and then in Attack of the Cybermen (it has become a running joke that her interactions with the Doctor occur off screen).

In Battlefield the Doctor produces his old UNIT ID card and Liz Shaw's to try and get into a secured area. Then there are the references to the Doctor still having a job/being employed by UNIT in New Who (The Sontaran Stratagem, The Day of the Doctor, Death in Heaven).

In The Stolen Earth the Tenth Doctor says that ""someone tried to move the Earth before, but that was a long time ago..."" which is a direct reference to The Dalek Invasion of Earth where the Daleks tried to turn Earth into an engine by drilling into its core.

The Doctor mentions the Master and his dealings with the Daleks and the Axons (Frontier in Space and The Claws of Axos) in The Last of The Time Lords",null,0,null,1430514722,null,0,false,0,cqvfbgx,null,t3_34jm84,null,t1_cqvfbgx,null,t3_34jm84,null,null,null,1432719823,null,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9,null

Several threads on /r/personalfinance about this coming up from time to time about why this is a difficult situation. The best idea would be for you to buy the house with your deposit and the mortgage being yours, with her paying you rent (i.e. not mortgage). If she's your girlfriend and want to make her feel like she's a part of the home, then she can buy the furniture, have reduced rent, pay the bills and so forth.

A couple hours later, I started to feel a little sluggish and confused, with a mild headache, all symptoms of CO poisoning.

I ended up going to the hospital as a precautionary measure, and found out that I did in fact have elevated levels of CO in my blood. It wasn't at all close to the ""you're going to be puking like crazy and maybe pass out and die"" stage, and like I said I felt more or less fine all day. But if I'd spent a few more hours in my apartment, it could have gotten to that level.

So, uh, I guess what I'm trying to say is CO detectors are a good thing to have just in case, even if you might at first get pissed when they wake you up after 4 hours of sleep.

That's what I thought, but if he's now saying there will be a referendum on a REFORMED EU - [which Juncker says here will not happen before 2019](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32495060) - then that means Dave wouldn't call a referendum before then, so realistically there won't be one before the next 2020 election. 

So in other words, politicians (in this case Dave) are talking shite and stringing the electorate along again.

For the record (and for those who downvoted my earlier comments) , I think that if there we got a referendum then we'd probably vote to stay in. The point is, we shouldn't allow politicians to tell lies or stretch the truth and mislead people.

He's a good player, but if we won't adjust our tactics to suit him (like we did with Suarez for example), then I don't see the point in playing him and getting angry. He's not that type of striker, everyone knew that, but for some reason I was hoping that he would change his style for the team.

&gt;The __Webster ruling__ is a [test case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_case_(law\)) in association football [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_law) involving [Andy Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Webster), a [defender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(association_football\)) formerly with [Heart of Midlothian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Midlothian_F.C.) [football club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_club) in Edinburgh, Scotland. In September 2006 he became the first player to exploit the updated [transfer regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(football\)) of [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA), football's [governing body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_governing_body), which stipulated that players are able to unilaterally walk away from a contract after a fixed period, regardless of the duration of the contract itself. Although the long-term effects of the decision remain unclear, it has been compared to the landmark [Bosman ruling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosman_ruling) of 1995 in its potential significance.

I got made redundant and after some time out travelling I signed up to an Access to HE course in Computing 2 years ago at 37. I have now just completed my first year Computer Science degree and it was definitely a good decision to get back into education in this way. There is a lot of help, support and advice available and I found it very easy to fit in. Like the OP I made some poor choices with regards to my education when I was younger but I can honestly say that it doesn't matter. The FE college (where you do the Access course) will only be interested in your motivation and any university will only be interested in recent qualifications (and motivation etc)

With regards to funding, you can get a Student Loan to pay the course fees which are (were) £3000 and repayment terms are the same as any other student loan. If you then go on to complete a degree, the loan for the Access course is cancelled and you only have to repay the degree part.

A supply and confidence agreement would have at least given them greater opportunity to hold the Tories to greater account, and pull out 2 years through if they backstab the LibDems (which they did).

Talking to him we came to the conclusion is not that there is a subsidy for Welsh and Scottish students, but that England is taken as a whole, when it isnt and there is much disparity between regions.

Technical justification: I know of at least one form of crypto where it's possible to have a backdoor without otherwise weakening it, elliptic curve. As well as the particular algorithm, a choice needs to be made of certain numbers (or ""the curve"") and in some cases it's possible that the way the numbers are chosen could leave a backdoor, known only to the people who came up with them. For this reason, most modern curve ciphers have their curves built with ""nothing up my sleeve numbers"" - e.g. ""we use 1, 2, and pi"".

Ivanovic hasn't been dropped this year at all, which is silly, because he's been a high variance player, who's been absolutely amazing at times, and then he also had a rough patch where he was getting caught too far forward, and not putting in the effort to track back.

He has less pace than Luis. Not saying that I'm disagreeing with your point, but your argument was silly. 

His pace isn't really that important. For how high we push him up no speed will be fast enough to get back in time if we lose possession in a shitty spot. He is fast enough. And Dave isn't that much faster. The speed on the right side would basically stay the same.

While I wish we'd take a better role in the European Union as a whole I wouldn't say that five years slightly out of the game, compared to the ""Noughties"" is us dwindling on the world stage so much as just taking a step back. Ed has already said that David's inclusion during his term has damaged relations with foreign powers, which means Ed's going to probably take more of a leadership role than Cameron did in foreign affairs if he gets elected. And if Cameron get's back in then he'll have a better idea how to operate foreign relations due to his past five years in office along with the new navy ships coming in which will boost British prestige. So we can expect more involvement abroad no matter who gets in on May 7^th

I'll admit Scotland's been an issue in terms of stability but they voted to remain within the Union, and have explicitly said they won't try another referendum in the near future. I expect this slight fault in relations is probably just a temporary thing for now while 2015-2020 will see the U.K take a front seat once again on the world stage in more overt ways.

Jol deserved more time to fix things after he did so well until then. He turned us into a team that consistently qualified from Europe. He bought players like Dawson, Huddlestone, Lennon and Defoe, who would remain the core of our squad for many years, including our CL qualifying year.

Redknapp led us to the Champion's League for the first time. He shaped the squad into a side that could demolish smaller teams (9-1 against Wigan, anyone?) and grind our results against bigger teams (AC Milan springs to mind). He didn't receive financial backing in 2011-12, and that stopped him leading us even higher.

Sherwood gave us our highest win ratio in premier league history. He brought through players, such as Bentaleb and Kane. He got Adebayor firing. He's now proving at Aston Villa that it wasn't a fluke. This sacking annoys me the most - he deserved a full season with the squad.

If anyone is curious, my updated analysis of profanity rates and my new team sub activity rate analysis is finished. We did not keep our #1 title as most profane club. Still got #2, though. We beat the cunts (barely,) but fucking Westham beat us, by a lot, even after I sifted through for people just making profanity spamming posts. We also ended up #14 in total words used per subscriber on Premier League subreddits. We also beat the cunts in that, though, so not a total loss. We ended up with 93.59 words per subscriber, compared to their 44.43. QPR crushed that one with 376.09, thanks largely to having only 523 subscribers.

Anyone curious about my methodology can read up more [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/2r68l3/rcoys_most_used_words_of_2014/cncuunz). The updated profanity analysis post should take place in a week or so after I make the graphs and pretty them up a bit.

The 2003 invasion of Iraq springs to mind. Ignoring the whole weapons of mass destruction thing (you know the ones they didn't find), politicians frequently fell back onto brutality of the Hussain regime and its violations of human rights, including the egregious immorality of Saddam Hussein himself and of his children.  

Clearly, politicians in the United Kingdom need to have its interests at heart, but i don't agree with you regarding foreign relations and supporting countries, of which if you take Saudi Arabia for example beheaded 19 people in two weeks in August 2014. The crimes of those beheaded included sorcery and drug smuggling. Thats one out a plethora of human rights violations, one of these countries in the region commits.  
I ask you, to what end do you feel that Britain's interests abroad should come before our moral views and internal affairs of another sovereign nation? Would fathers stoning their daughters too death who have been raped and have thus dishonoured the family be acceptable?, the torture of its civilians during a civil uprising? to name a few. If anything your ""foreign relations"" seems to be with the people in power, not the hundreds of thousands who protested in Bahrain in 2011, i feel that foreign relations should at least include both parties, if not then the latter which is greater in number and in representation of views held by citizens of that country.  
  
Or would it have to be something like flagrant mass genocide for you to change your views?, perhaps not.

The pub in question is called the Canons Gait (sic) on the Royal Mile, and it's run by a friend of mine whom everyone knows as Mac (if you watch the youtube videos he's the lanky ginger guy)  The incident started in the pub, when Farage appeared unannounced with the Press in tow and started to hold a press conference in the pub, without the prior knowledge of the  management.  Unfortunately the pub sponsors a number of university societies in an effort to drive trade, and so in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday it of course mainly had a bunch of students in it,  whom of course called their friends and before you know it there's 20+ students heckling Farage as he tries to talk to the Press.  So at this point Mac steps in, he's got 20 regular customers on one side and Farage and his water drinking Press entourage on the other and he deals with the situation as any Bar Manager would and ejects Farage, but alas by this point the story is out on twitter and 20 students has become 60 protesters.  First of all Farage tried to get in a taxi, but (God bless the guy) the driver refuses his fare, and he has to get back out into the surrounding crowd.  Soon the Police arrive and they encourage Farage back into the pub and have Mac lock the door behind them whilst they call for a Van to take Farage away.  

Why was it an incident?  Because Farage presumed he would be welcome in that environment and didn't do even the most basic amount of research.  He went to the Canons Gait because it's a pub near the Scottish Parliament, if he'd called and asked them first they'd have told it it would've been full of students at the time.

I had sort of picked Spurs towards the end of the 2012-13 season as a team to support in real life because I have a few English cousins and thought I'd pick an English team. Spurs seemed like the team for me, but I never really watched the matches. Basically the only thing I new about the squad was that we had Bale.

 Then came the summer of 2013, I started to watch USA play in the CONCACAF Gold Cup, and I was fucking hooked. I didn't miss a single USA match that summer and when the competition ended, it left a huge void in my football world. That's when I subscribed to this sub, and started learning more about the club and the players. I was ecstatic when I found out that Clint Dempsey played for Spurs, I'll admit. Then later that transfer window we sold Bale... and Dempsey. 

I was a bit heartbroken that Dempsey left, but I was still excited about the upcoming season. NBC started airing every Premier League game here in the U.S. and I could watch every match. Last season was a bit of a shit show with all our collapses against big teams and the tactics Tim era, but I still had fun every time I woke up on the weekends and watched the matches. Couldn't have ended up supporting a better team.

Please no.

Changing course shouldn't be an issue if you keep your grades up in first year.

Reddit it predominantley American so most of /r/COYS are US supporters, I myself live in Canada and have done so for half my life. My first 10 years I lived in North London, exactly 1 mile from WHL &amp;  Highbury (old Arsenal stadium). Fortunately, all my friends were tottenham supporters (likely because they were jewish) and so from a very young age I supported spurs and Robbie Keane was my favourite player until Bale of 2013. I actually didn't watch soccer from 2007-2010 because after I moved to Canada and after the dust settled my parents stopped our 'Setanta' subscription, so I couldn't watch the games and online streaming wasn't a thing, neither was North American coverage of the BPL. But, once games started to be shown and Tottenham finally made the champions league I jumped right back into it. /r/coys is fantastic but after being on here for about 3 years (through different accounts), make sure you verify sources posted and take other opinions with a fist of salt.

I like Balo and he has talent but is lazy. I hate the media and how they talk about him. All game vs hull they just sat and found every fault they could with Balo which is bullshit of them to do but yeah he still needs to improve. Confidence comes with playing well. If he played better and in the box more and much more energetic he would do a lot better. Hendo coutihno lallana and Sterling all behind him and he still can't score, the problem is they aren't behind him. He drops to deep when were attacking no stead of getting in the box todo finish off their passes. 

I hope he gets another season but at this point it looks unlikely. He's a notoriously lazy trainer and that is basically Rogers number one hated attribute in a player so therefore won't play as much which also hurts his confidence.

I can't advocate voting for Chris Hawtree in Hove. I think his heart is in the right place, but he's too detached from the reality of most peoples' lives. On second thought, he'll fit right in with the Tory voters in Hove and Hangleton.

And the council have done some good things recently, like the Seven Dials revamp, and the (possibly misguided) attempt to improve Viaduct Road. But the council have had four years to build much needed primary and secondary schools and have only just managed to announce a secondary school recently. I can't tell you who to vote for as they've all been pretty shit over the years.

Traditionally right-wing media is The Telegraph and The Daily Mail, whilst The Guardian and The Mirror have always leaned left, then the others have usually dabbled between both.

null,false,vln,null,null,null,"Good question.

The short answer is nothing. There's good reasons for this, though.

Firstly, as /u/IxionS3 said, you're going to be clocked if you turn up at the same polling station multiple times. So you'd need to be visiting different ones. To have more than a minuscule chance of swinging a result in the first-past-the-post system, you'd need lots of co-conspirators, all visiting lots of polling stations. Independently, mind, turning up on a coach and piling into the polling station would ring alarm bells with the staff! Then you'd need to be very confident in your accurate list of people who definitely will not be voting, because turning up and claiming to be somebody who has already voted triggers a specific procedure (tendered ballots, see [page 36] (http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/164255/EPE-Polling-station-handbook.pdf)), and a spike in the numbers of tendered ballots would trigger a serious investigation.

All that effort and risk, and you *might* influence the election of *one* MP....

Why no ID and no polling card? It's the principle of maximum enfranchisement.

Requiring the polling card would exclude those who have not received theirs, or have lost it, and this number of people is likely to be far greater than those potentially committing in-person fraud. There would also be added complexity and cost in requiring forgery-proof polling cards, too, and staff who can accurately assess their security.

More important, though, is those people who have no ID, or who have no access to it. This would disproportionately discriminate against particular segments of the population, most of whom are especially vulnerable - the poor, the homeless, victims of domestic violence or other abuse (preventing access to personal documents being a common feature of domestic abuse, so such people would probably not have access to their polling card either), and so on.

(~~Because of~~ Despite the way in which voter ID requirements indirectly discriminate against particular groups, such laws have recently been introduced in various American states, for transparently ~~racial~~ partisan reasons while being presented under the guise of preventing almost totally non-existent fraud.)",null,0,null,1430550462,null,0,false,0,cqvuuoa,null,t3_34ias9,null,t1_cqvuuoa,null,t1_cqv5snv,null,null,null,1432727285,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

Under English/Welsh law a declaration like that can be made by anybody, at any time, in any place. You can do that right now in your bedroom if you like, and then you have officially changed your name.

However if you do it by means of a deed poll then it gets published in a place where official organisations such as government bodies and banks etc are expecting it to be, so it's then easier to persuade them to start using your new name as well.

But a deed poll has no special bearing in law, it's simply the same statement that you can make anywhere. That's because your name itself has no special bearing in law, you can legally use an alias or aliases whenever you want to.

Obviously the season is not over, and there are some factors to consider like ""easier"" leagues, injuries, and differences in game to factor in. Also, certain player roles have changed (i.e. Lambert not taking penalties anymore, etc...).

My point is that we clearly have players who can score goals, from a variety of positions, but something has been failed systemically this season.

Whether it's been the shift in tactics, or maybe a congested schedule, I'm not sure.

We *know* what style we want to play - we played it last season, we played it at the start of this season when Sturridge was fit, we played it when Sterling was deputising as striker.

All of our midfielders operate by providing through balls. They need a striker who makes runs off the shoulder of the last man to get on the end of those through balls. Balotelli and Lambert don't do this, Borini tries but isn't good enough.

We don't need a superstar striker - forget Sanchez, if Loic Remy had passed our medical, we'd be much better off, and he's not a superstar. If we'd gotten Diafra Sakho, definitely not a superstar, we'd be much better off.

Why aren't other players scoring? Gerrard scored penalties; you win penalties when you're fouled in the box. You can't get fouled in the box if none of your players get in the box. So, it comes back to the striker's movement. A striker that makes runs behind the back four makes the opposition worried, makes them sit deep - creating more space for our midfielders.

But I argue, that since we didn't buy any appropriate forwards, nor do we even play the same formation we did last year - are we really trying to line up that way? I mean, it wasn't a secret that Balo and Lambo are not the most mobile, so if we 100% knew our intention was to play off the defenders back, then why the hell are they in our squad?

I'm just frustrated in general, nothing has quite lined up well. It seems like our very naive plan was to pray that Studge would be injury free, and that our backup strikers we intended to have zero in common with our main forward, y'know?

It's just casual observation and no hard numbers, but there seems to be an increasing reliance on hollywood passes and wonder-strikers from coutinho and hendo, that were clearly not part of the managers plan. So in those cases, I'm glad for the goals, but it seems like players are selectively choosing when to follow the plan, and when to say ""fuck it"".

Anyways, solid reply. It's hard having these discussions without posts getting downvoted to shit.

The problem is the lack of movement up front, the runs that Sturridge makes inturn makes the midfielders tick. It makes Coutinho's, Hendo's, Lallana's job easier, they have a option up front to play a through ball. Even further the running and movement a fit Studge provides creates gaps and spaces for the midfielders to exploit. As we saw last season, Hendo bombing forward at almost every opportunity. How many times has that happened this season? 

We have a style of play and an identity, the problem is the personnel we have up front.

Rape carries an automatic life sentence due to the seriousness of the offence, in common with extreme offences like murder, solicitation to murder and sex with a girl under 13 (as per OP'S commentary boys are afforded no such protection.)

In contrast the sexual assault law you're describing doesn't even carry a mandatory prison sentence as far as I know. Yes, it can theoretically carry a life sentence but this is the absolute maximum penalty for the offence with severe aggravation as opposed to the minimum penalty as with rape. 

So the question stands: why should raping a man or a boy be a lesser crime with a lesser penalty? Are men's lives not shattered by rape too? Do we not need the same protection afforded to women?

&gt;Despite the spread of issues covered, their new policies on housing and planning achieved less coverage. UKIP is the first party to agree to RICS Property in Politics proposals for a national brownfield map, as a premise for the building of one million brownfield homes over the next ten years.

&gt;The spur to this colossal development project will include the relaxation of planning laws to allow conversion of out-of-town commercial property to homes, the offer of £10,000 per unit incentives to developers for brownfield remediation building, and the introduction of a statutory duty on local authorities to bring empty homes back into use with permission for them to charge up to 50% more council tax on these abandoned properties.
The building of affordable property will be encouraged by the granting of stamp duty exemptions for properties worth less than £250,000 and a National Homeless Register will be formed with a view to eliminating homelessness in the UK. 

&gt;They furthermore promised to scrap the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) in favour of brownfield-first and greenbelt protection guidelines, streamline the planning application process by merging planning and building control departments in local authorities, while freeing local authorities from government-imposed minimum housing numbers and promoting small residential additions to villages over large-scale developments.

&gt;The localist and nationalist flavour was predictably present, with promises to push local authorities to prioritise those with ‘strong local connections’ in the allocation of properties, and an insistence on the registration of tenants’ nationality in the allocation of social, Local Authority and Housing Association housing.

&gt;Foreign nationals are to be excluded from accessing Right-To-Buy and Help-To-Buy schemes unless they can prove HMUK Military Service, and from accessing social housing until they have worked in the UK for five years. 

&gt;Taken collectively, this raft of policies appeared to be the first real programme of this campaign that seeks to solve Britain’s long-term supply-side crisis.

They've even costed it by saying they'd introduce a government brownfield bond to attract private sector investment.  Brownfield once it has been processed is always worth more at the end.  It's a surefire return for private investors and international hedgefunds once the land is sold for development.  The bonds will pay for the remediation incentive, developers will actually want to use brownfield instead of green again.  

A fully costed 1,000,000 home brownfield revolution, with a potential 1,500,000 more, without going into greenfield.

Get the goalscorers in and sorted out and let Rodgers figure out the rest. He did last season and if he's here and gets those 2, he will do again.

This season, if nothing else has told Rodgers that perhaps a 3 at the back formation is the way. Let's try to build up on that.

null,false,TheAntiqueTraveller,null,null,null,"Sorry I don't think you are quite right - rape is defined under s.1 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. It carries up to a maximum of life in prison - there is no automatic life sentence. Assualt by penetration is under s.2, and also carries up to a maximum of life in prison. It is a separate offence to general sexual assault, and is treated as very serious. 

In fact sentencing guidelines by the CPS are broadly similar - custodial in the range of 5-15 years as a start increasing with severity.

You also misunderstand - men *can* be victims of rape (and assualt by penetration). The law does not distinguish between men and women in that respect, except of course that men have one less orifice. The difference between the two offences is only men can perpetrate rape as it is defined as penetration by a penis. Assualt by penetration is by anything else. 

The OP's point is also about perpetration. It means boys under 14 can commit rape. But a boy or girl under 14 can also commit assualt by penetration. The law surrounding sex with a child under 13 also makes no distinction as to gender. The OP has misunderstood.

I don't like people rioting and what not, but something needs to change in the USA, the whole gun culture and the way the police deal with it is messed up, so hopefully some good will come out of it.

edit: When that guy got shot in missouri and the riots where going on and then people were saying, as if they were the voice of reason, 'this man was a criminal, he held up a liquor store (or whatever he did - its irrelevant)' fact is the punishment for his crime was not death on the streets without any kind of trial.

If police start killing people there should be rioting. Like it or not rioting does actually work to highlight problems. 

There will always be a criminal element that get's attracted to chaos and it is a shame it's affecting their own surroundings but the world is now watching. 

I see this as potentially the second half of the civil rights movement unfolding nationally and I wish it good luck, it may be turbulent but unless equality is handed down from above, it should be taken.

I'd recommend a small bit of garden to 'meadow', easiest bit would be not to cut for 3 months to allow all kinds of insects to gather there. Just tidy up with strimmer and trim down completely to let ground recover at end of autumn. A cheat's way of getting the same effect is a pack of 'wildflowers'.that may be too high maintainence to keep in its place.  
If you are going for vegetables, try to plant your crops cleverly with herbs and short term growing in-between long term crops. ie onions inbetween carrots to deter carrot fly, marigolds around tomatoes and potatoes, even in pots help as marigolds spread like crazy when flowering.  
Trouble is, to start now would be too late unless you put in buddleja, Lavender shrubs.. Actually I'd get some potted lavender in as its difficult to germinate properly.  
With preparation, I'd wait a few months for the seeds to go on offer to clear from shops and use them from Febuary-April in small plastic cloches, starting inside.  
If you are after something decorative/colourful and low maintenance:

* Morning Glory (medium from seed, try to keep pets off them)
* Foxglove (medium, also poisonus to pets if eaten)
* Daffodils (Easy, early display, depends on soil.), Tulips, crocus and snowdrops. In fact, look out for a bulk box of these and put them around 2 inches under early November. Daffodils, tulips and Crocus also like being surrounded and grow well under grass too, provides a nice display when Winter lifts and they appear.
* Marigolds, english French.. only difference is shape and number of petals if i remember correctly.
* green manures such as mustard, clover, and others i can't remember right now. Flowering ones can help replenish soil when dug in after flowering.
* Borage, not so much used herb, tried it near brasscias with good results, mainly for deterring nasty insects native to cabbages though.
* Petunia's some varieties last from Autumn through late winter.
* sunflowers, in good soil, you will only need to buy 1 pack of seeds to last years for this one.
* Sweet pea's are also good, got a bare bit of wall or fencing what doesn't look appealing? pots of these will climb up it and bee's love them.
* Holyhock is a another fantastic one, had some dark red flowered ones which everyone wanted seed from before I moved from my garden. Buy a few colours and watch the results.
* Other great choices possibly available in plug plant form include Hellebore, Dahlia, Verbena, Rudbeckia and Cosmos",null,0,null,1430562689,null,0,false,0,cqvxcdd,null,t3_34lut8,null,t1_cqvxcdd,null,t3_34lut8,null,null,null,1432728529,null,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10,null

* Brendan Rodgers seems to believe that the best defence is a great offence.
* Which is fine when you have a Luis Suarez and a healthy Daniel Sturridge.
* Of course, with hindsight being 20/20, it seems that it was a massive gamble and mistake to rely on Daniel Sturridge to be healthy.
* But we suddenly lost 52 goals and we struggled greatly because of that. (Though, we should be encouraged that our squad battled as hard as they did).

So, in a sort of over-simplified sense, yah, we do need a ""proper"" striker.

But there are encouraging signs for the next season especially if Daniel Sturridge is completely healthy, if Origi develops and adjusts quickly to the Premier League, if the likes of Sterling, Henderson, Coutinho make the next step and add consistent goal-scoring to their skills.

For a variety of reasons, I think our summer transfer window will actually be relatively quiet. But I do think we'll focus on getting the best striker we can possibly get relative to whatever limitations that we may have.

We used to have 4 elemental groups (Fire, Earth, Water, Air) but they've fallen by the wayside recently, leaving only Fire Point - after all, it is a Fire Festival :D  

The Fire Arch that the procession passes through signifies travelling to the ""other world"" or faerie realm, and it was here that the four elements were visited.  

The Whites and Reds (originally known as the White Women and the Red Men although group participation has absolutely never been gender proscribed) broadly represent order and chaos respectively, although the more obvious extension to that with the Reds is desire. 

At the end of the whole thing, everyone comes together in the Bower where the Reds and Whites finally meet and have a bit of a dance about, essentially merging those two aspects of character in one whole again.

Then, in October, we switch the whole thing around at Samhuinn and celebrate the onset of winter :D

He's already said he wants to avoid coalitioning with the SNP (which would kill his voting base in Scotland) and knows that a minority government (one that's relying on MPs from other parties to pass laws) would be weak and prone to exploding from the inside.

What he might do instead is point out that the system is broken, and call for dramatic change to our political system. He'd call for a 'National Coalition' - The term used to describe our war-time coalition that had all the parties working together for strong leadership in war. This might cause mass defections from other parties to join and get *even* get support from Tories (a previous Conservative front bencher has already talked about the need for a National Coalition)

The National Coalition of Unity (or something like that) would push forward a written constitution which would probably include:

* Turning the House of Lords into a 'Senate', in which large area or country in the UK gets to vote for a 'Senator' or 'Leader' or 'Tyrant' (joke), similar to the American House of Representatives
* Give those regions loads of power, let them raise their own taxes and spend their own money. This would, among other things, give many Scots what they want; control over their own country whilst still remaining part of the Union.
* Commiting the UK to the EU - This is a genius move, as half of the Tories would vote for this and half wouldn't - Exploding the party into bickering and squabbling.
* Maybe change the very unfair voting system of First Past The Post (we're running against one another and lots of other candidates. You get 23% of the vote and I get 24%... I win... Even though only a quarter of voters want me in and less than half want either of us in) which would attract Liberal Democrats to the NatCoalition
* Very likely reducing the voting age to 16.
* A 'lock' that stops the next government pissing all over the constitution because they don't like it.

How do we know this? Why, that's pretty much what's in Labour's manifesto already. It's also in the Liberal Democrats one also...

It would also settle the Scottish question and make the SNP responsible for Scotland's money... With a failing oil economy and no more fiscal support from rUK that might be tight. He'd be seen as saving the Union, reforming the voting system and reforming the House of Lords... But it's a big gamble. Exciting times!

I personally see it as a horrible experience for anyone who's property or safety has been jeopardised in the rioting but it seems like a fairly normal response to the level of inequality in American culture, America has alot of growing up to do socially, as a country your so advanced economically to much of the world but socially so backwards in some aspects.

Hell, N.Korea called you out on your racism recently... it was probably political tactics really but if N.Korea is giving you shit about the state of your society and its right... I think you have problems that need addressing.  
  
The scariest thing for me is that if I visited your country I wouldn't feel safe, a policeman walking past you should make you feel safer not scared for your life... and I'm white, I imagine for anyone non-caucasian America is a straight up no-go zone lately... especially places like Ferguson.

You're obviously living in denial. [Here's one example](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-32523364) and there are many more of these. The OO is supposed to be a Christian fraternity but yet they parade alongside sectarian bigots and even have their own members openly show their bigotry towards others. Can you really not see a problem with that? 

The Battle of the Boyne isn't offensive and in fact it should be celebrated just like the Appreciate Boys of Derry celebrate the closing of the gates. I'm from Derry and I've been to plenty to ABOD parades spanning 30 years and they've done an amazing job at turning things around to the point that its turning into a tourist attraction. 

It doesn't take holding communities to ransom to celebrate a historic event and if does then people need to sit down and rethink what they're doing. Would you find it acceptable if Republicans held thousands of parades each year around NI to celebrate 1916? I certainly wouldn't but according to your logic I should. 

&gt; The simple solution to that is for everyone to wise the fuck up and let each side live with their culture and beliefs.

I couldn't agree more but that's not going to happen when paramilitaries are involved and people openly show their hatred for &lt;insert nationality here&gt; during such events. 

Way to go to the OP and others for turning this discussion into about Loyalism rather than about the dissidents. And the OP dares to say ""wonder where they all are in threads about the real ira"", yeah I fucking wonder...

Share your selections, blues.

Edit:

1 - Jagielka
2 - Naismith
3 - ...Could be anyone, really. McCarthy.

Since his derby thunderbolt, nobody's been as consistent, as significant, as effective, as Everton as The Jag, and I know Stonesy is the next big thing, but Jags is in my opinion, the closest thing to Dave Watson we're going to get.

For young player, I remember when the list used to include Victor Anichebe and a bunch of promising young kids about to be released by Davie 'We always give them a chance' Moyes. Now look at it.

1 - Lukaku
2 - McCarthy
3 - Stones

If you're wondering why I put Lukaku above McCarthy in this but not the main award, it's because I feel he's really had a learning year, and the player that swanned about from August to January, was really learning to be effective as the lone striker and since those dark days has really become effective at what he's supposed to do, apart from just what he does.

Doesn't work like that. Your tax allowance is split by 12 or 52 depending on whether you're paid monthly or weekly and applied to that pay. As you go along through the year it gets adjusted so for example if in month 1 you earned more than 1/12th of the tax free portion you would pay tax but if in month 2 you earned below 1/12 you'd pay none that month and the two months combined equalled 2/12ths of your tax free allowance then the second month should have a refund in your wages of what you paid in the first month. 

As you will be ending in September you will most likely have got to a point where you've paid tax which doesn't get refunded. You cannot claim the refund at this point because you may get another job between then and the end of this tax year. Instead you have to wait and claim it after April 5th 2016.",null,0,null,1430564148,null,0,false,0,cqvxn7w,null,t3_34lr7x,null,t1_cqvxn7w,null,t3_34lr7x,null,null,null,1432728671,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

Bank of England and LIBOR interest rates are very low meaning it is cheaper for them to borrow money from elsewhere to lend out than to use your deposits.

Banks want customers, they are required to maintain a minimum capital level so do want people to save so will offer promotional rates to get you to move to them and its not uncommon for those to be a couple of percent or more than the normal rate.

* Yes, Gerrard should start the last four matches.
* I think the pressure and the burden of expectation has finally become too much for our relatively young squad. I think there's a certain degree of mental burnout coupled with the deflation the squad feels after being knocked out of the FA Cup and realizing that an undefeated run does not come close to ensuring a 4th place spot.
* Therefore, I feel there are some hanging heads, some eyes already looking forward to the summer holiday, disappointment, depression, mental exhaustion, etc. and that seems apparent in our recent lackluster performances.

So what now? I'm not entirely sure. I guess I'm feeling the same deflation as well. And while I think Europa League will serve as crucial experience for our squad, I don't think I'll be terribly gutted if we don't get Europa League.

But I think it's moments like this where Brendan Rodgers can shine and truly earn his wages. Say whatever you want about his tactics, his attitude, transfer tactics, this and that ... but one thing I am confident about is Rodgers' ability to encourage and motivate. And I think a time like this while serve as a great challenge and opportunity for Rodgers to shine.

I don't think Rodgers is any danger of getting sacked but if we play some inspired football over the next four matches, I think that would go a long way and help Rodgers gain some important points with the supporters, ownership and pundits as we go into the summer.",null,0,null,1430564405,null,0,false,0,cqvxp3h,null,t3_34ks42,null,t1_cqvxp3h,null,t3_34ks42,null,null,null,1432728696,null,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

However, there have been a couple of cases at the European Court of Human Rights that found that one may not be covered. In one of the case of SW v United Kingdom - a case about marital rape and the retrospective application of this as a criminal offence as there was a 'gap' in the law that allowed marital intercourse - The ECtHR ruled that although Article 7 cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case. But if the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen, then it would be an offence that could be charged retrospectively.

TLDR: Essentially, it its probably extremely unlikely. But if you're interested then follow Myles Jackman on twitter. He regularly posts about the developments of the law around explicit matieral.

i am left wondering though why does NI need voter id then? why has the electoral commission recommended it in the future for everywhere else? with significant amounts of the population failing to vote (1/3?) doesn't that decrease the risk of detection, i think many people are registered automatically from maybe long past elections and then fail to actually cast votes, harder to keep track of impersonation in those cases. not sure if it's more of a danger in low or high population districts. 

with increasing polarisation, things getting down to the wire enough where coalitions need to be formed, in closely fought battles, i'm not sure i trust in the detection abilities of every presiding officer in the country. isn't it too dangerous to think that every election, not a single one in all 600 odd seats, where the result hasn't been influenced by some illegal tinkering.

null,false,yermaaaaa,null,null,null,"Hi there!

The Crown Bar is a very famous and incredibly beautiful old bar in the centre of Belfast. That's the place to have a mid afternoon pint of Guinness.

In South Belfast, Queen's University was recently listed as one of the top 15 most beautiful universities in the world, so that would definitely tick the old building wish list. Next to the university is Botanic Gardens, Belfast's prettiest park, which is also home to the Palm House, an early example of a (big!) greenhouse built in the 1840s. And next to Botanic gardens is the Ulster Museum, so you have 3 good places to visit within a stone's throw of each other. There's plenty of decent eating in that area of town too- the Black Bear has some of the best coffee in Belfast and Cafe Conor is a lovely space for a relaxing lunch.

Down by the docks you have the Titanic museum, housed in the most exciting new building in Belfast, it's worth the trip down there just fur a glimpse of that alone. I hear good- if expensive- things about the museum tour itself.

At the North East end of the city centre you have the Cathedral Quarter. Hip and hipsterish with cobbled, narrow streets, oodles of pubs, shops, the best coffee in Northern Ireland (Established Coffee), and the MAC art gallery which is well worth a visit.

Oh, and finally, St George's Market to the East of the city centre is great for a walk round, and is housed in a lovely Victorian market building. I'm heading there now for some lunch!

null,false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,null,"I think you touch upon a very interesting point regarding ""loyalty."" Most supporters fully acknowledge the ""business"" of football, however, it's the players who are always accused of being disloyal, greedy, etc. while we are happy to support the corporation and their treatment of players as objects. And supporters treat professional athletes as assets too! It's all about ""what have you done for me lately"" and ""he's not good enough"" and we are arrogant enough to asses the ""value"" of a player and what wages he should ""earn"" or ""deserve.""

Meanwhile, the player is ignored as a human being. Does anyone really care if Fabio Borini in the last five years has gone from Italy, to Chelsea, to Swansea, to Parma, to Roma, to Liverpool, to Sunderland and then back to Liverpool? How lonely would that existence be? Moving from new city to new city, attempting to make new friends in the squad and in the city, while also being expected to perform.

Of course, the brutal argument is, well, he's a professional footballer making fuck-tons of money, he should feel lucky to do what he does. Fuck him.

It's ironic that we demand so much loyalty from a player while supporters and clubs show little loyalty and regard for a player simply because they make more money than us for playing a game.

It's similar to way pop stars are treated, that they are a property of the public and the public are entitled to every bit of a pop star.

Yes, I realize that a pop star made the choice to be a public figure.

However, could I deny the dreams of a person whose only ability is to be able to entertain? Or to kick a football around?

Could I feel so entitled to someone simply because I paid for a ticket and bought the merch?

... Well, it's a difficult to say. Do I want to spend my hard-earned money to see a pop-star deliver a shitty performance? Or see a shitty performance on the pitch?

I totally understand that there has to be a balance between ownership/club and player but to place the entire blame on a player (in this case Raheem Sterling) seems silly to me.

For a variety of reasons, I always sided with the talent.

All that being said, I think it's a delicate balancing act in these sorts of contract negotiations.

I think Raheem Sterling is clearly a special player and I think Sterling realizes he needs LFC and LFC also realize they need Sterling. Ultimately, I believe the deal will get done and -- like many negotiations where both parties have similar negotiating leverage -- I think LFC will pay more than they hoped to pay. And Sterling will receive less money than he hoped to receive.

And, in the end, hopefully supporters will see the delightful evolution of Raheem Sterling and we'll laugh about how much we made out of that contract situation back in 2015.",null,0,null,1430566388,null,0,false,0,cqvy49w,null,t3_34k7zv,null,t1_cqvy49w,null,t1_cqvu7c3,null,null,null,1432728894,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

Example: Many people seem to think that electronic voting of some kind would be an improvement. But the truth is that it's not even theoretically possible to make it secure. I was an election observer for the 2008 London Mayoral election. It was counted electronically, and IMO the counting system was fundamentally flawed. London Elects (the agency that ran the election) even stated publicly that their priority was to achieve a result that was uncontroversial, rather than correct or fair. To that end, they actively resisted publishing, or allowing access to information that could uncover electoral fraud, if it were being perpetrated. Preventing systematic electoral fraud simply wasn't on their radar.

Real, significant electoral fraud is so alien to us in the UK, that we just don't think about how it might happen. The paper ballot &amp; counting system is magnificently secure, because every way to break it has already been tried and countermeasures put in place - centuries ago!

&gt; where do you stand on mandatory voting by the way?

Improving people's access to democracy is important, and low turnout is a huge problem. Postal voting has been expanded in recent years, in order to try and address that, but I worry that postal votes are too open to fraud. Mandatory voting seems preferable to that, but perhaps we could try other less extreme measures first?

I heard a suggestion recently that voting should be mandatory for a young person's first election - in order to introduce them to the idea of voting. That seems like a reasonable idea.

Perhaps we could make election day a public holiday? Now that we have fixed term Parliaments, everyone knows in advance when the election will be, so businesses ought to be able to plan for it. Make it so that you only get the day off if you actually use it to vote?

Then 7 straight wins without conceding we're in with the chance of automatic promotion. This will be our first promotion since 2006 when we were champions of League 1. I really hope Morecambe are nice to us after doing a huge favour beating Wycombe last week. Above everything I want to thank Daniel Bentley for being a fucking insane goalkeeper that has smashed the home clean sheet record (hasn't let in a goal since October) and David Worrall for scoring that amazing free kick against Bury last Tuesday after his wife gave birth prematurely the week before. No-one in the team have really let us down. Corr has been hitting them in consistantly. The midfield has been brilliant with Leonard keeping everything together. Back four has been varied, but recently a Barrett and Bolger combination has been brilliant. Coker has been insane and John White is a perfect captain. I'm sad to see Kevan Hurst playing less and less after wrecking shop last season. But with the team we have at the moment, players will lose spots. We saw Conor Clifford leave on loan and I don't think we'll see anymore of him, which is a shame. I really hope we can sign our loanees (Worrall, Piggot, Cassidy and Deegan) and to get Southend legend Adam Barrett to sign for his last season with us. I've never felt brilliant about Phil Brown but the stuff he's done for us have been magical. If we go up today, he will have all my respect and then some.

Whenever a new potential war comes up it is always displayed to us as a war between Good vs Evil. The Evil Dictator vs Freedom-wanting rebels. When in reality Syria showed that a lot of the rebels were in fact extremists as a lot of them are now part of ISIS. It was also demonstrated in Libya, a campaign the UK and France contributed more proportionally more then the US to oust Gaddafi, now the country has no functional government and is a war zone due to a power vacuum from destroying the regime. This looks like a distant memory ""Free Libya"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpyH9sPKk30 

I don't oppose bombing ISIS, they are literally evil. But the opposition isn't amazing either since a lot of Iraq's forces are Sharia militias and are reported to abuse Sunni communities. That said. The UK and US are partially to blame for ISIS. They made some very questionable decisions after the fall of Saddam such as banning the Ba'ath Party, which contained all of Iraq's experienced Politicians and people of influence. It also alienated the Sunni's. Also disbanding the Iraqi army led to the country becoming more unstable and many ex-servicemen of Iraq's army would go onto join insurgents fighting British and American troops.

Intervening in conflicts or going to war isn't always bad, its sometimes justified. But the last 15 years have being nothing but ill-informed decisions without the foresight to think what happens when we oust a regimes that has being in place for decades. If America doesn't think we are no longer in a special relationship due to our reluctance to go into international conflicts for a change then so be it. If we ever do have another Iraq-like conflict I hope we will join on the basis of a well informed opinion and a plan for what happens when the regime inevitability falls.

Our military is certainly very thin, and the human resources it draws upon are sometimes not the best. But the military has suffered in terms of it's PR ever since Iraq - and the conflicts since. The army no longer draws the brightest and the best - why would they want to work for an organisation that's blatantly become a pawn. Politicians seem to see the military as irrelevant until they want to strike a pose. . . And why would anyone want to die so that some fat political wankers can make themselves some capital? 

Imo, streamlining the armed forces isn't necessarily a bad thing, but we need to change the image, stay small and efficient. Stay out of unnecessary conflicts. We shouldn't be fighting anyone just because we want to look like we're about something, or to showcase out arms industry. We should be focusing on our domestic problems first.

....  
&gt; It was only when the last of Britain's gold and foreign assets had been surrendered that the embattled nation began to receive direct aid from the U.S., through the 'lend-lease' scheme.  
...  
&gt;But the long-term price was high. Many British businesses in America were sold at fire-sale prices for whatever American rivals chose to pay. 
Lend-lease's conditions constraining British trade were so stringent that London had to plead with Washington to be allowed to buy Argentine meat, vital to feeding the British people. The governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, wrote in March 1941 that 'we are entirely in the hands of American ""friends""'.  
Churchill pleaded with Roosevelt that, if Britain's cash drain to the U.S. continued, then, though 'victory was won with our blood and sweat, and civilisation saved, we should stand stripped to the bone'. Roosevelt ignored him. He gave not a thought to Britain's post-war solvency.

If i was everywhere in the world where i felt there are people who need help, i would have to split myself into hundreds - thousands of pieces. Whether i have or haven't attended protests, whether i have or haven't a family i need to support, should not at all dictate whether or not i can express my views on the internet like above. You are like that person who when you complain about the government squeals ""if you don't like it do something about it"", its fucking disgusting.  
  
What is more ignominious is that you bring in ""feeling superior"", which has absolutely nothing to do with anything. I'm sorry i may have pointed out a gaping hole in your morality, or re-affirmed the truth that life isn't a disney movie, but to me, if anything, we could flip your petty retort around and say that those in power, and the majority of people like you who hold these views, who support these actions, feel superior by not caring, by supporting these disgusting relations, by turning the other cheek.  
  
You are like my nan. Who the other day when i was the discussing the possible involvement of a Royal Family member and several other establishment figures in a child paedophile ring, was telling me i should do something about it right here right now, instead of discussing it and acting like i was better then them.  
It is pathetic - possibly equivocation, grow up.  
  
Again i can only emphasis my earlier ideas, that you Wolenski, MrEugeneKrabs and those who hold similar views deserve the government you have right now. A government who selectively picks to intervene with the moral views and internal affairs of another sovereign nation if it suits them, while turning the other cheek and supporting those who commit such disgusting acts in other places.  
  
Your views are enlightening too. I struggle to grasp how the United Kingdoms politicians and foreign relations can deal in such double standards, duplicity and be disingenuous, yet your responses which others have said - are all to common in the sub, suggest that you would be complicit if you were in such places of power.  
  
And clearly if you look at inequality, both in the rise in the United Kingdom and in these states, it is evident that your method is not working. Or at least it is, but for the rulers, not the ruled.

What I've learned:

* **Oil Cleansing** is amazing. It was the first thing I did that helped me see an immediate reduction in my oil production. I've found oil cleansers with emulsifiers work best for my skin, so far I've tried three and I really like them all!

* **Drinking more water** is something that I majorly slack with but I know my oily skin is linked to dehydration. If I'm not drinking a cup of water an hour my skin really lets me know that is simply unacceptable and to up my intake. 

* **Gel Moisturisers** are my best friend.

* **Chemical Exfoliation** isn't scary and is more gentle however, sometimes less really is more. I conflated using a higher percentage with needing a higher frequency of use. I needed a higher AHA percentage, but I really don't need to use it every night. Twice a week is more than plenty. 

* **Honey &amp; Propolis** - My skin drinks this stuff up like it is the nectar of the gods. I can't even describe how my skin just loves this combination. 

* **Washing my skin less** - has been kind of a struggle for me. But  over a few months I've dropped the oil cleanser in the morning, and only used the foam cleanser. Now I only use water and konjac. My skin really really appreciates being babied in the morning.

The image of a paedophile as a loner in a parka approaching kids in the street is actually a harmful one. That's why victims' families often seem so surprised when it turns out to have been an otherwise friendly and well-loved man to whom they were close. That disbelief has led to abuse being silenced. 

Truth is, any man you meet could be a paedophile. Your best friend, your relative, the surgeon who saved your life, your teenage son, a major politician or celebrity. But rather than that being a cause for alarm (because, in fact, very few probably are), it just reinforces that they need a way to come to terms with their sexual desires. 

Here's an example of a 19-year-old American who was so frustrated by the lack of understanding, he set up his own support group for paedophiles. The group vows never to act upon the desires that they themselves never wanted in the first place: http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/522/tarred-and-feathered

The NHS should welcome with open arms those non-offenders who seek help. The question of what to do with offenders who wish to stop is a far tougher one - threaten them with prison for admitting what they did, and they might continue to hide and continue to abuse. I don't have an answer for that problem.   

Finally, we need more academic research to really get to grips with the facts. How many people are paedophiles? How many offend? What treatment methods are most effective? The UK is desperately short on the statistics we need to tackle the problem effectively.",null,0,null,1430569991,null,0,1430570406,0,cqvz1t8,null,t3_34lwqv,null,t1_cqvz1t8,null,t1_cqvyjod,null,null,null,1432729334,null,29,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,29,null

Fullbacks: Manquillo, Moreno, **Santon (5mil)**, Enrique

CBs: Skrtel, Lovren, Sakho, Ilori

Midfield: Lucas, Allen, Henderson, Can, **Milner (free)**, **Illaramendi (15-20mil)**

Attacking Midfield: Coutinho, Lallana, Sterling, **Depay (25mil)**, Ibe, Markovic

Forwards: Origi, Sturridge, **Vietto (15mil)**, **Ings (free)**

6 signings at ~65mil, but two of them are free transfers, Lambert is also moved on for a little bit of money, and we didn't grab anyone who'd be on astronomical wages except *maybe* Memphis.  Unfortunately, I really think we won't solve our striker problem with an actual top class striker this summer because it'll cost too much money.  We'll bring in a few players instead, get more goals from the midfield with Memphis (who can actually play all across the front similar to Sterling but with better end product) and see what a player like Ings can do when he's got consistent and then hope that a promising youngster like Vietto is ready to make a step up.  We won't be anywhere near the title next season, but we'll make a very serious run at the top 4 again.

The inclusion of Santon is a bit strange, but think about it for a minute.  He was pretty good for Newcastle for a while so we know he can succeed in the Premier League.  He is equally comfortable on both the left and the right side of the defence and good getting forward.  He'll be cheap too because Newcastle wants him gone.  He's on a loan to buy with Inter right now, but we might be able to step in and hijack that a little bit.  He's also only 24 years old so he's still on the younger side and he's a pretty intelligent player, probably someone that Rodgers could really take to the next level.

I think we really need a CB this summer too, but I'm not sure how we'd fit it in with the budget constraint.  I'd flip the hell out for someone like Fabian Schaar, who would probably be reasonably cheap too (like 7-10mil) and I think would transition very well into the Premier League.

And finally, we still have goalkeeper problems but with Jones looking set to sign a new deal and Mignolet's superb resurgence I seriously doubt we'll look for one this summer.",null,0,null,1430570015,null,0,false,0,cqvz213,null,t3_34k7ij,null,t1_cqvz213,null,t3_34k7ij,null,null,null,1432729336,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

As a top 6 side, we should be looking for a keeper who can add to the team, not just be there when the defence doesn't hold up - because the defence should hold up. Casteels has fantastic distribution from his kicks and his throws and would add something to the team. I think Migs has improved on his kicking, especially with the ball rolling, but he's still not great at distribution in general. 

Someone like Casteels or Mat Ryan, who can start a counter attack with a smart throw or kick is far more useful than a keeper who is just going to sit on his line and make a few good one-on-one saves every now and then.

Also, I disagree with the Belgium manager. I think Casteels is a better all round keeper than Migs.

Copy/pasted from yesteday...

&gt;Voting helps perpetuate first-past-the-post and thus actively does harm to our democracy by perpetuating a semi-democracy.

&gt;If no one participates, there is no voting system. Therefore the credibility of any given voting system scales in relation to the level of participation. If the level of participation is high, it lends the voting system credibility, but if it's low, it hurts the voting systems credibility. It's far easier to argue FPTP should be scrapped if it has a 35% turnout than if it has a 90% turnout.

&gt;It's essentially the same idea as voting with your wallet, but with votes. I think most of us recognize that companies are far less receptive to customer complaints until it starts to affect their bottom line. If you threaten to cancel your service, subscription or whatever, most companies will suddenly go ""woah, hang on now, lets not be hasty. Maybe something could be worked out"". Similarly, political parties will keep on keeping on until they start to lose votes. This is the very argument used to justify voting for smaller parties or spoiling your ballot. If they stop getting your votes, they want to win them back and adjust accordingly.

&gt;You can apply the same thing to the voting system. If you continue to plug votes in, it has very little reason to change. You're doing what it requires to succeed. As such, it is nigh-impossible to vote in a way that will harm first past the post more than it will help it, because merely participating helps prop it up more than it contributes to tearing it down. There is one exception which is specific to FPTP however and that's hung parliaments. If you're in a contested seat and you can help someone win that makes a hung parliament more likely, you should absolutely do so (according to current polls, reducing tory seats seems to be desirable to that end). This is because FPTP aims to avoid hung parliaments and thus they damage its credibility along with low turnout. Additionally, if you're in a seat where a pro-reform party has a real chance of winning (Greens in Brighton, for example), then voting may do more good than harm.

However it's likely that the SNP and the LibDems would not kick a minority labour government out. 

Some horse trading may occur for labour to balance the books. The SNP are happy to spend beyond what is sensible so they will not vote for cuts - plus politically voting for cuts is suicidal. Labour will have to try to wrap things up together. For example VAT goes up but the bedroom tax goes and mental health care goes up.

On the other hand we could be in for a stalemate if people in England go back to the tories for fear of a SNP-led labour administration (I don't think there's real reason to be scared, it's not going to be terrible but the tories have been scaremongering).

If people abandon UKIP and slip away from labour who they feel are being led to left then we could have the tories needing to form a coalition with the DUP and LibDem and the 2 or 3 UKIP MPs, or the labour needing to form a coalition with everybody bar UKIP and DUP.

I really think you have probably started revision very late, which is not good. Try looking at the exam specification on your exam boards website.

One of the beauties of liberal democracy is that people who don't participate are accounted for. By choosing not to vote, it is taken as tacit approval and trust in whatever everyone else picks - it's apathy; I don't care what all you voters pick, so you can decide. Maybe it would be different if no-one at all voted, but the establishment doesn't necessarily know that that's because the voting system is shit. It might be taken as dissatisfaction with the candidates/parties on offer. The outcome of the AV referendum shows there is a clear appetite for FPTP, even if some of those No votes were because they wanted something like STV.

 I think this is different from going to a booth and drawing a dick on your ballot paper. Spoiling your ballot registers clear disillusionment with the current status quo.

In the first instance there will already be a provider at the house you're moving in to, you need to call them up, give them a gas and elec meter reading and tell them your name to start getting bills. It might be obvious who they are, because there is a sticker on the meter or something if there isn't though call up British Gas and then they'll be able to tell you who your provider is if it isn't them.

If you want to change supplier you can then do so (although I'd wait a month or so to avoid confusion) [this](http://www.uswitch.com/) is a pretty good website for doing that. Working out who you should be with is much much easier if you know what your usage is in kwh, so it might be worth looking at your bills in France to get a rough estimate, also you don't say how long you're in the UK for, but a lot of tariffs will lock your rate for 1,2 or 3+ years and they're not possible to break without fees, so if you're leaving within a year or so avoid those. I'm with First Utility, they're dirt cheap they haven't screwed up. You could change to EDF if you wanted :D

Water 

[Southern water](https://www.southernwater.co.uk/) is your water company, if you have a water meter then your bill will vary based on usage, if you don't (and most people don't) then you pay flat rate.

Someone with no money as you claim, would have sold your computer long ago and smoking weed would be a distant memory. Maybe you do have 'medically proven' conditions but I come from an education background and worked in a college where probably 75% of students also had ADHD or whatever, so what?

My post probably wasn't removed because I chose, kindly, to give you actual real world advice rather than being a virtual shoulder to cry on. You are in a fucking mess and like I said, your benefits whatever they amount to WILL run dry at some point, society is against you.

None of them say they think it's because they're happy with the status quo or trust everyone else to make the right choice. You'll also have heard them talking about the likelihood of electoral reform becoming an issue once again after the election, on account of another hung parliament. We're already on course for electoral reform and a higher turn-out won't be likely to aid in that, aside from the caveats I mentioned above.

Spoiling your ballot has two problems. Firstly, it only demonstrates dissatisfaction with the choices on offer, not the voting system and no matter how you spoil it, it'll be counted as ""voter intention uncertain"". Secondly, it's counted in the turn-out, so you end up propping up FPTP unwillingly. You will never get enough people to spoil their ballots to make FPTP look as bad as a third or more of the country not voting.

You can buy tickets from the [website](http://eticketing.evertonfc.com/PagesPublic/Home/home.aspx) or [StubHub](http://www.stubhub.co.uk/everton-tickets/?creative=54533996897&amp;keyword=1002561021_c&amp;gcid=C12289B333) if they're sold out. You can buy tickets from the ground itself and there are normally some people selling spares too.

2. In terms of seating I've sat in Park End and the Top Balcony, both nice places to sit but the Gwladys Street end is where a lot of the atmosphere is so you'll want to sit there. The top balcony is nice if you want the 'TV' view. Park End is adjacent to away fans which can be fun for the fan interactions.

3. As others have said, there is sufficient transport option in and out of the ground with a few train stations nearby (Sandhills is probably the best due to the [soccerbus](http://www.merseytravel.gov.uk/travelling-around/route-maps/Pages/Soccerbus.aspx)) and buses everywhere.

Also if you get the chance, I recommend going to Everton One (The club store), get some merch, after that you can walk around the ground and read the club timeline which might interest you.",null,0,null,1430575805,null,0,false,0,cqw0xeg,null,t3_34l4bn,null,t1_cqw0xeg,null,t3_34l4bn,null,null,null,1432730217,null,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3,null

There are two possibilities. First, he feels no shame and was able to justify the act to himself, committing it willingly. Second, he knows it is wrong (not just that others think it is wrong) but felt unable at that moment to control his desires. 

I would count both of these as mental illness. 

Almost all people are able to control their sexual desires almost all the time. However some feel compelled to commit a sexual act, the same some feel compelled to drink or gamble. Of course an offending paedophile is not the same as a gambling addict, but it is true that humans can act compulsively and irrationally. 

It isn't necessarily the case, but is quite possible, that he didn't *rationally* ""decide"" to rape a baby. He may have lost control of his inhibition due to any number of factors. It seems either way like mental illness. And for treatment of that mental illness he should have sought help, not kept his thoughts to himself.

A lot of the talk of disengaged etc. voters can probably be attributed to dissatisfaction with the two main choices, but things won't change without positive action.

The AV referendum did a lot more harm than good, in that the parties which benefit from FPTP can point to the result as an indication that there's no appetite for change. A change in the voting system is probably the sort of thing that will require a referendum - maybe it shouldn't, but a precedent has been set. 

The key point is that not voting does not provide any sort of reason for why things should change. Both of the big parties benefit from FPTP, and while they're not as strong as they once were they still command the majority of seats.

&gt;This is just brainless and even Brand says that peaceful revolution is the way forward. Stating that the 'only way' forward is the mass slaughter of people is pathetic.

How is it pathetic? The history of humanity proves you wrong. In fact the basis of society proves you wrong too. Our society and ALL societies are based on the monopoly of violence. Thus the only way to change things is to upset this monopoly for a short time.

The difference between North Korea and the UK is one of overtness. NK has a poor PR system and therefore the knife the state holds needs to be overt. This is inefficient because you need to pay for 100000s of soldiers and a significant bureaucracy develops because of it.

The UK the knife is ALWAYS there merely that it is hidden and individuals are conditioned to obey. Look up the term Monkey shower experiment:

http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6828/was-the-experiment-with-five-monkeys-a-ladder-a-banana-and-a-water-spray-condu 

Therefore our internal security forces can be smaller and and we don't need 100000s of soldiers on street corners. Which encourages efficiency and gives credence to the lie that we're free. We hold sham elections to give further credibility to the illusion that 'we're free!'. This of course puts the entity that controls the state in a big bind. In that in order to maintain the illusion they have to be careful when use the knife. Because each time they use it to steal something from the people the fascade starts to crumble. There was a slight wobble during the 2011 riots as the police were deployed only to protect the elites. 


Plus it doesn't matter WHO deploys the violence the state or the individuals. The big wobble is all that is needed. Look up S Korea. They massacred civilians on order of the government. This was a massive catalyst for real change and the military government was changed into another. A similar thing happened in Taiwan. 89 in Beijing people were gunned down. The government is still in charge but they had to accelerate reforms in order to divide the pie up a bit more. HK in 66 massive rioting, the government crushed it but they came back for revenge in 67. This caused laws to change and REAL social change like a proper government housing scheme to start and the shanty towns to be slowly taken apart.

Replay history yourself the anti Iraq war riots what if it turned violent? History would be different.


So what will happen on May 8th NOTHING. Business as usual....

Hell if you had any sense of history (spot the irony because people think I'm a foreigner) you would understand the Magna Carta and how 1000s of people marched with pitch forks. Seeing 1000s of pitch forks made the King change his tune pretty quick.

What threat is there to an MP today? We can't even fucken recall them for gross misconduct they laugh at you on May 8th and then spend the next 4.5 years lining their own pockets.

His performance in a 2 nil away win away against Wimbledon - live on TV, including a free kick where he seemed to hit the ball then hover, for a 8 year old was immense.  I managed to see him play a few more games on TV, including for England, but from that moment on, I was Tottenham.  I firmly believe that as Tottenham fans we don't really chose to support Spurs, but somehow we are born as fans, there is something about them that appeals in a very special.  The way we put up with the dross to see the Ginola's jink this way or that, to see the Bale's outpace people, to see Van der Vaart nutmeg Wilshere twice inside 5 seconds.

Ins - Ings (free), Milner (free), Ayew (free), Depay (25m), Mat Ryan (5m), Janmaat (12m), Coentrao (10m)
Total - 51m

Outs - Gerrard (free), Johnson (free), Jones (free), Lambert (2m), Borini (6m), Balotelli (10m), Sterling (50m), Enrique (3m), Aspas (5m), Coates (3m), Alberto (3m), Wisdom (3m)
Total - 85m

Net spend - 34m profit

Which leaves our squad for next season looking like this;

GK - Mignolet, Ryan, Ward
DEF - Skrtel, Sakho, Lovren, Janmaat, Moreno, Coentrao, Manquillo, Flannagan
MID - Henderson, Milner, Ayew, Can, Lucas, Allen, Coutinho, Lallana, Markovic, Ibe
FWD - Depay, Ings, Sturridge, Origi

A few notes - obviously the big one there is Sterling going, but if he didn't I'd either drop Ayew out, or consider moving Allen on, but either way, assuming FSG allow 30-40m on top of sales, we'd still be easily under budget.

The other civil rights campaign goals seem to suggest more of a bias towards those of the Irish persuasion 
&gt;an end to job discrimination – it showed evidence that Catholics/nationalists were less likely to be given certain jobs, especially government jobs

&gt;an end to discrimination in housing allocation – it showed evidence that unionist-controlled local councils allocated housing to Protestants ahead of Catholics/nationalists

&gt;one man, one vote – in NI, only householders could vote in local elections, while in the rest of the UK all adults could vote

&gt;an end to gerrymandering of electoral boundaries – this meant that nationalists had less voting power than unionists, even where nationalists were a majority

&gt;reform of the police force (Royal Ulster Constabulary or RUC) – it was almost 100% Protestant and accused of sectarianism and police brutality

&gt;repeal of the Special Powers Act – this allowed police to search without a warrant, arrest and imprison people without charge or trial, ban any assemblies or parades, and ban any publications; the Act was used almost exclusively against nationalists and republicans
