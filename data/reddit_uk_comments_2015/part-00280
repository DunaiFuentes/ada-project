I would agree with you right now if you will tell me that you think British forces who killed innocent people should be in the same boat? American troops being terrorists? If you're prepared to say that killing innocent people is the criteria for something being a terrorist, then spot on I will agree the IRA were terrorists, but your definition of terrorist has to be unbiased and universal.

Well if you call Northern Ireland peaceful then yeah.

What I do is more of a gentle push - it nudges it out of 1st/2nd [as appropriate] and into where neutral is - compared to a sharp push when going up or down gears.

We're looking at figures where men are killing themselves almost 3.5 times as much as women and it's gone up 10% in the past 2 years. That's a massive spike, and society hasn't had that many job losses, nor culturally shifted such that men are less likely to talk about their feelings. I just think that we need a realistic talk about this without saying it is definitively cause by this, that or the other - even if it's true, it's not helping.

And, anecdotally, I've noticed a substantial rise amongst my peers of ~25. There is a real sense of loss of purpose for a lot of young men, in that things seem increasingly hostile to our continued existence. Fair or not, I've had half a dozen calls at night from male friends who, knowing I've tried to kill myself, asked me how to sto those feelings in themselves. One particularly harrowing night, I had to console one of my best friends through a door so he didn't stab himself. These are successful, good people - they have stable and good jobs, half were in happy long term relationships, they are in good areas, they are generally kind, etc. it worries me, because if they feel like this now, how on earth are middle aged men going to cope without the right support? If it's not working for men even when they seek help, we MUST do something because otherwise these will rise further.

Sorry, turned into a rant, but it really scares me. It feels like this comes up once a week, but nothing is ever done.

Everyone on here is fairly tech savvy and with the kind of 'start up' mentality Norman Lamb was saying we should have for the party going forward as almost a guerilla activist party there are so many things everyone on here can get involved with, to what ever degree they feel comfortable, to help spread the word, get news articles out into the wider domain, and basically help swing attention and good feeling back towards the lib dems across the social media and internet sphere. 

I've spotted a few users around here that I know have a vast wealth of information available on this kind of thing from Lib Dem HQ I'm sure they would be happy to share.

That you don't agree with what they stand for is an irrelevance in this case

&gt; My point is that just by being alive they are afforded this privilege, they did nothing to earn it except being born.

Again this is a non-starter of an argument. Prince George just yesterday did an entire photoshoot for his birthday that was shared with not only the entirety of the UK but the entire world. That little boy will never live a ""normal"" life. I am by no means a royalist, and have no desire to defend them, but to say that they don't earn their keep when it comes to living in London is wholly unfair to the lives they are expected to live. 


If anything Prince George has less choice in life than most other people. That he gets A LOT of privileges is very true, but he also has a set path from birth to death.

You're 'due' whatever your employer thinks it can get away with paying you. If you agree to it, you sign a contract.

Perhaps your contract states something about pay rises and reviews, which would be helpful. Check, but I doubt it.

It might be most useful to compile a list of the ways you've [increased revenues and reduced costs](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/) for your current company. Then look for other jobs, asking for higher pay than what you're currently receiving. At the same time, go to your line manager with the list and also your review. Make the case that you earn the company more money through your work than most other employees, and that if your pay isn't altered to reflect that then you'll go and increase a different companies revenues.

Additionally  I don't understand how you can say **We actually are not behind those teams**  particular Bayern, and Barca? On paper and  **in reality**. For example take our champions league performance in the last 5 years:

2009-2010: Round 16 out to inter Milan 


2010-2011: QF out to Manchester United


2011 –2012:  Win the Champions league 


2012- 2013:Out group to Europa league


2013-2014 : Semi finals out to Atletico


2014-2015: QF out to PSG 


We've been in the semi final or further **once** in the last 5 years.How can you say we're not behind these teams when we're failed to match these teams performance in the last 5 years?
That is not to say we're not amazing, but to say we're not yet at the top  of the elite, we **are behind** these teams, and we need to correct that.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit mistake **two** in last 5 years typo haha. But the underlying point remains we have been no where as consistent in reaching the latter stages of Barca, and Bayern, so we can't claim to be the same level.

What says they don't have strategies lined up for the other three?  That this isn't a double bluff or misdirection?

&gt; Gandhi didn't say that.

Valid point, my apologies.

&gt; Also, congratulations on employing the most saccharine of all cliches in one paragraph and railing against cliches in the next paragraph. Has it occurred to you that being laughed at in no way suggests that you're eventually going to win?

The emphasis is on the '_You could even argue that_', as in it's _one possible explanation_ for what is about to happen.  I'm not suggesting that being laughed at implies winning at all, just that it's perfectly feasible that Jeremy'll pass straight through the phase of being the 'unelectable loony leftie' and into having the last laugh.

&gt; The substance is: It's bad because it's reactionary; it's reactionary because it wants to take things back to how they were in the past, despite the fact that those things have been widely discredited.

By whom?  There's this received wisdom that the post-war consensus is somehow inherently broken, but I haven't ever seen anything that isn't basically either coming from the free-market outriders, or just saying 'the public have been told X is the solution to their problems, and nobody has made a credible and sustained argument since 1979 that Y would be better, thus X must be correct'.

Sorry to wade into Milibandesque cliché, but the past brought us the NHS, the welfare state, and the comprehensive rebuilding of a country devastated by war.  What do we have now?  Increasing poverty, increasing inequality, people committing suicide because the system has consistently failed them, and yet the City is rolling in the dough and all the things our grandfathers built are being sold off at losses.

I'm sorry, but we _do_ have a lot to learn from the past, and the constant writing off of it as irrelevant or discredited without actually exploring why we and the electorate at large think that is counter-productive.

&gt; You cannot deal with 2015 problems with 1983 solutions

Suppose Jeremy's solutions really are exactly the same ones proposed in 1983.  What makes these solutions unusable here?  Scrapping Trident (unilateral disarmament, 1983 solution) could save a large amount of money that the government would then be able to use to either fund, say, expansion of council houses (2015 problem!) or even pay down the deficit (2015 problem!).  I admit that I'm not in the company of cold, hard figures here, but it's certainly worth arguing as a point rather than sweeping under pithy generalisations.

And let's talk about (shock horror!) renationalisation.  One of Ed Miliband's flagship policies, which was freezing the energy prices, [appears to have been quite grounded in public opinion](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ed-miliband-yougov-energy-freeze-prices-labour-509023).  Would not a nationalised energy infrastructure (1983 solution) help to solve the 2015 problem of high energy prices, low satisfaction, and profits going nowhere near the taxpayer?

&gt; especially not when those 'solutions' were comprehensively rejected by the electorate.

Firstly, we're talking one election 33 years ago now.  That's hardly a great indicator of what's going to happen in 2020, which is a year we haven't even passed now.

Secondly, 1983 was by no means a clear-cut left-right election: Labour had only just lost power, Thatcher was boosted by the Falklands, and by all accounts Labour's manifesto was badly marketed and targeted.  No, I'm _not_ saying that any one of these is the sole reason we lost.  I'm just saying that it's not a perfect indicator of 1983 views, let alone 2015.

And if we're bringing 2015 into it, yes, we do need to bring former-Labour/LibDem-gone-Tory voters into it.  But lo!  many of those voters abandoned us because of perceptions, not because of principles.  They want a welfare state that's there for those who need it and nobody else.  They want immigration to work for them.  They want a strong economy--who doesn't?--and Labour have spent 5 years failing to convince anyone that anything other than austerity works, so why should people think anti-austerity is credible?

&gt; The emphasis in the sentence: 'I wouldn’t want to win on an old-fashioned leftist platform' should fall on 'old-fashioned', not 'leftist'. Indeed, Blair makes this clear in a section that you quote yourself when he says it would 'take the country backwards'

I agree that my argument here was weak, but I'll try to defend it.

Given that the main argument I hear against a leftist platform is that it would be unelectable, and Blair took this one caveat away in his hypothetical situation, I don't see where his argument is going.  Call me biased, but I don't see anything the left is arguing for that is inherently contemptuous to the social democrat, with the exception of things like unilateral disarmament and foreign relations.  My point was that, since the left tend to go for the minimum compromise on achieving the ends I illustrated, then surely with no need to compromise then insisting on the middle ground comes across as being insincere.

(Admittedly, I didn't think about the economy when I was suggesting this--oh, the irony! I hear you cry.  But there is a strong movement, posted about several times in this very subreddit, that an anti-austerity growth-based economy would actually be more suitable than austerity for growing the country.)

Again, this whole rhetoric about things being 'old-fashioned' and 'taking the country backwards' is vapid appeal to novelty that doesn't address at all _why_ there's anything wrong with an argument that has been made for decades (except its own failure to break through, perhaps).  Neoliberalism is rooted in 19th century schools of thought, so I'd say _Blair_ is the one taking the country backwards and being old-fashioned.

&gt; Not if they hadn't gotten elected.

And we have a crystal ball that we can use to see that they wouldn't have?  Sure, we can get into what-if arguments until the cows come home, but 1997 wasn't exactly a scrape-through, nor was it entirely free of the we're-sick-of-Tories-and-want-a-change effect.  I disagree that Blair was necessary to win.

&gt; Also, can you really be arguing that all the good things Blair did were things any leader would've done but all the bad things were due to his unique character flaws?

The good things are all in line with Labour's purpose as a party, so yes, I do think any leader would have done them.  As for the bad things, no, I'm _not_ saying they're unique character flaws: many MPs voted for Iraq, many people bought into New Labour, etc.  It's an occupational hazard that, as the leader (and maybe he _did_ become leader based on his character foibles, sure!), he happens to be the biggest exponent for the things that went well _and_ wrong in the New Labour era.

&gt; Rescues NHS

Starts privatisation and re-organisation of it.  Continued and expanded the use of PFIs despite Labour opposing them initially.

&gt; Rescues schools

Starts the academy system, albeit in a much reduced form, I concede.

&gt; Gets more working class kinds into uni.

Tuition fees.  Also, what of the argument that, by making university a route for the masses, New Labour devalued university to the point where it's now simultaneously necessary to get an entire broad class of jobs _and_ prohibitively expensive for some talented but poor school-leavers?  Not a leftist argument I know, but one that gets bounded about a fair bit.

&gt; Is questioned for his loyalty for suggesting that the fact that he's spent his entire political career watching radical leftists lose elections is a good reason to suspect that they lose elections.

If you're going to make the argument elsewhere that we can get in with a moderate stance at the ballot box and then do progressive things in government, then why did that not apply to Blair?  Is the argument flawed?

When a trade mark application is made to the UKIPO, it examines the application to decide whether the trade mark that is being applied for is distinctive enough to be a trade mark. Registration usually takes about nine months. However, this time span can be greatly increased if any objections are raised to the mark's registration by owners of similar registered trade marks or by the UKIPO themselves. ***Once a trademark is registered, it is kept on the register for ten years, after which it needs to be renewed in order to preserve the owner's rights over it.

Original comment is gone, so I'm not going to waste time trying to argue with you over this.

&gt;something the police can't really allow for when they're formed in a line fighting a riot

Fighting a riot? I've seen the video, they're just walking along. No one was attacking the police at the time or even near them. The policeman out of nowhere just decides to wallop him, knocking him down to the ground with great force.

It was clearly excessive use of force. His vulnerable state may have contributed to his death, but in the end, he wouldn't have died right there and then if he hadn't been pushed. If any member of the public accidentally killed a person because that person was particularly vulnerable, they'd be done for involuntary manslaughter or assault, maybe ABH. And we should expect *more* of the police in terms of responsible use of force, not less.

I only say it's not clear cut as an acknowledgement of the inconsistencies between the different coroner's reports on the cause of death. The inquest in the end found it to be due to the pushing over, but the initial coroner still says it was due to natural causes. They state that he was also the only one to see the body in it's entirety, so some say his account should be more reliable than the later reports. That's why I say we'll never know for sure, because the evidence is not entirely consistent. The inquest is only a judgement made by human beings as the best they can do with what evidence they have, it is not infallible.

&gt;but he's certainly not the innocent bystander in the wrong place at the wrong time that Tomlinson was

I don't know why you're pointing out the obvious. I never said he was an innocent bystander like Tomlinson, I only said he was killed when they mistakenly believed he had a gun. I may be wrong about that and some say he *did* have a gun, in which case, I withdraw that statement.",null,0,null,1437575928,null,0,false,0,ctc4q65,null,t3_3e65un,null,t1_ctc4q65,null,t1_ctc2cfh,null,null,null,1438090760,null,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2,null

Three weeks after the Brighton bomb, in which the IRA had tried to destroy the democratically elected government of this country, you invited two convicted IRA terrorists to the House of Commons.""

&gt; Mr Corbyn replied: ""They were former prisoners who had come out of prison, women who had came out of prison to Parliament, actually to a meeting that had been arranged long before, to talk about prison conditions and rehabilitation of prisoners. Is there anything wrong with that since they had a spent conviction?""

&gt; Neill: ""Their organisation had just tried to blow up the British Government, did you not think about that?""

&gt; Corbyn: ""Of course I thought about it and I wanted a peace process. That's why I maintained a level of contact with Sinn Fein throughout that period, as indeed secretly the British Government did...""

&gt; Neill: ""You didn't want a peace process, you wanted a united Ireland. You saw Northern Ireland as an imperialist, colonial situation.""

&gt; Corbyn: ""I do believe ultimately that Ireland should be reunited, but I also never believed there was going to be a military victory for either side in Northern Ireland.

&gt; ""There had to be a peace process and there was a peace process and I am not ashamed of those of us that had the courage to step outside and say there has to be discussions with people... in order to being about a ceasefire which did indeed happen and the second ceasefire finally brought about the Belfast Agreement.

  Wake up at 6am, make a coffee, kick the missus out of bed, shit shower shave, 3 cigarettes and a train. In town for half 7 in the office for before 8. Watch the numbers go up or down on the Fidessa screen (boss likes Fidessa, I'd prefer FactSet, ho hum) for about 10 minutes, then I go outside and whip some poor people, throw maimed children into wells, that sort of thing. Got to use up all that time before lunch, you know? 
 
  So, we get to lunch, usually I'll go to Goucho or similar and order a very large steak and an obscenely expensive bottle of wine, think the lunch equivalent to your mortgage. Because of all the cocaine I stuffed up my nose during the pauper-whipping or children drowning I'm not usually all that hungry, so I just throw my wine all over the place while shouting loudly about my achievements to similar smooth features psychopaths, they're not interested, and nor am I really but you know, if it gets too quiet the vapid emptiness of our lives builds to a deafening crescendo, so we've simply got to fill the void, even if it's just faceflapping.   
 
  One day a week I make it back to the office after lunch, where I'll throw a ball of receipts at one of the lowly HR gnomes to sort through and spend it dodging phone-calls from my clients telling them all sorts of things I've read in Citywire or Investment Week that I don't really care about but we've got these journalists for a reason. Essentially, we just blindly throw client money at whatever the fuck the buzzword of the day at the moment is and then back it up with whatever we read in the paper. Mea Culpa? Fuck no. *Momentum* investing, we do what the market does. Yeah, that sounds good, we'll go with that for the moment.   
 
  The rest of the time that I don't go back to the office I'll just stay in the pub until it's time to go to the gent's club or the golf course. The gent's club is basically a big house somewhere with lots of rooms that look like old livings rooms where we all sit and laugh at how poor you lot are, and the golf club is a golf club. Where I play golf with similarly wealthy people.  
 
  There. I think that's all the stereotypes isn't it? Good.  
 
  In all honesty, I work really hard. I studied really hard. I don't get a chance for fun during the week, and I'm tired on the weekend. The things you see on TV and in movies is largely bollocks. Your stockbroker doesn't drive a lambo or throw champagne around, they probably drive a 5 year old Skoda superb, live in a regular 3 bedroom in a suburb and go on the same holidays as you. The arseholes in the big institutions, yeah there's some of them around, but they don't live like in the movies either.    
 
  We get up early. We read a lot. We speak to brokers and get as much information as we can. We try to keep costs low, and we try to pass that on. We're friendly. We get phonecalls on Saturday mornings from clients, and Sunday nights we think about the week ahead. We talk you and your friends through things in the pub. We get shit thrown at us for being part of an evil industry when a couple of cunts ruin it, when all we want to do is make some money for you, because that's our job. We're mostly not-too-shit at it either. It takes a lot of work and thinking and sometimes balls.

Just confirming that I'll definitely have a link for the stream, and it'll be a YouTube one so will work on mobile and chromecast. I'll post it before the game but if it gets taken down I'll pm links to active users who ask for it. It will be up in a moment, just watching Jamaica - USA

**Edit, LINK:** [Here]( https://youtu.be/mWiZFQBjTfw) is a good quality youtube stream. It's currently showing USA vs Jamaica semi final (Jamaica are winning 2-1 but the US are pushing hard for a goal), and will show the Chelsea game straight after (and will probably show a dancing dude in between play). If the link gets taken down I'll provide another.

As for loss of purpose, I wish I could say. I'm struggling with it myself, so I guess from my perspective it's this - if I get hit by a car tomorrow, nothing changes. Sure, some people will be sad for a few months, but otherwise I have no effect or cause. I'm on track to own a house at 26, but what for? What does it matter at all? I don't really care about my future, because it just seems like turning a handle to live for the sake of living. I go out of my job, and see hatred on the Internet, read hatred in the papers because I must be doing my job wrong as car insurance is still expensive, and so on. Even stupid shit hurts - when I was a kid, my sister got one of those ""boys are stupid, throw rocks at them"" bags - that's really tough to deal with when your head is fucked, and all her friends just thought it was hilarious that it slammed all boys. One of my first girlfriends in 6th form reacted to me having a panic attack in private by saying ""man up"" and walking away. It's just the little things which add up, and you sit there wondering what the point of continuing to crank the wheel to live actually is.

And it's not just me I've heard it from. One of the 6 who have spoken to me, I approached first. See, he had slash marks up his arm and always hide them with long sleeves - I only noticed when he took his jacket off once. Turns out that for the past 2 years he had gone home and cut himself with a bread knife on his upper arm because ""it made him feel better"". I was only 16 at the time, and had no idea how to deal with that. He's still a good friend, but on quite strong medication currently. He's also told me that he doesn't really see the point of going on, and only does so because the drugs make him mindless 

It's just background noise now. I expect more of my friends to be depressed than not nowadays. There's just nothing out there for us - or at least, that's how it can often feel. So I guess that's what I mean by lack of purpose, even though I can't really define it.

Then when that's sorted go to your bank, anyone you get bills from, employers, loan companies etc and get them to change their details. They'll ask for copies of the Deed Poll and passport, that sort of thing, just takes a few letters though.

Never got a new birth certificate though. On the rare occasions where I've needed it (once perhaps, for a Visa) I had to take my Deed Poll too to show that I'd changed my name. No hassle involved though.

These days I rarely, if ever, need to do anything. Some Visa applications or official paperwork will ask if you've ever had another name but it's all on the standard forms - fill it out and that's usually it.

Normally I would agree with you but I think this time it may be different.

It's been 25years since the Tories got their majority, if it takes Labour 25years to get their chance again I feel that the problems we will be facing in those times may not be relevant to any current party's manifesto.

I believe by 2030 we will be facing new challenges that will have arisen from automation that we currently don't face. With up to 40% of the workforce being replaced by robots and automation I feel that the 2030's-2050's will be the start of forming a new (possibly global) system where by we re-examine what it means to work &amp; earn money, there simply won't be jobs for everyone.

In this time I think we will see new parties from both sides but rather than be left or right, blue or red I think one will be for embracing the future and the other will want to keep things the same &amp; stifle progression towards full automation.

They perform a credit check when you open an account. After you open one account, your credit score drops as ""opening a new account"" is a negative aspect as Credit companies determine it as meaning you need more credit (which is bad). At this point, if you try to open another account (with a low score), you may fail for your score being too low - but then you might get another hit on your account for having too many credit searches on your account within a period of time, reducing your score even more.

After around 3 to 6 months (depends on company), it clears and you're account is restored + some more if you haven't had trouble with your credit account. Otherwise it looks like you're desperately searching for credit.

All this varies between companies, but most financial help websites will tell you the same thing.

A standard Cash ISA is absolutely fine. An ISA is an ISA. Pays you tax-free returns (don't look into Cash &amp; Stocks ISA unless you have money to spare/willing to take risks/lose). There's no ""best"", just rates that differ.

Blair basically manoeuvred Labour into the centre to eat up any remotely popular policies the Tories had, creating what we now dub as ""Tory-lite"". He forfeited Old Labour's staunch left wing politics and made a pragmatic New Labour. Coupled with a youthful and (then) trustworthy persona, this combination won votes, as it was designed to do.

Remember in the mid 90s when all the leaders of both leading parties were white haired and/or bald? We had Foot/ Kinnock/ Smith and Hague/ IDS/ Howard. Blair reinvented the image of what party leaders could look like. That proved to be popular, and the Conservatives followed with their own pseudo-Blair (who has strangely escaped ageing for the time being...).

All three major parties followed suit. Clegg, Cameron, the Miliband brothers, with Brown and Campbell being the exceptions (you can add Kennedy there if you want). Yes, Blair did age (badly) while in office, but it still remains the fact that he ushered in the trend for younger leaders.

There were 2 major outcomes:

1. personality over policies as the electorate was led to focus on the leader
2. both main parties gravitated towards the centre and lost their individuality

However, with the Conservative party riding on the Blair success strategy with their own pseudo-Blair at the helm, I really do believe Corbyn stands a chance of appealing to the electorate. He offers a genuine challenge, a completely different approach and authenticity. Three things which Blair used to appeal to the electorate in 1997 (most of it turned out to be bollocks, but still). 

Just even looking different is making him stand out to the electorate... which is exactly what Blair did. In the midst of the bland cocktail of politicians that includes Burnham/ Cooper/ Kendall, Corbyn looks far from the slick Oxbridge graduates that betrayed our trust. That's also the reason why I believe Farage has proven to be as popular as he is with the electorate.

**tl;dr** Corbyn actually brings something new to the table, unlike Blair's brand of Tory-lite politics which everyone has followed since.

Willian is defensively responsible, but he isn't redundant in attack when he plays through the middle.

Despite the fact that Israel has a functioning democracy, is a developed economy, is socially liberal in some areas, etc etc. Because it is painfully obvious that there is only one party in this conflict with power, with control, and it is Israel. Israel is the only one that can end this and Israel is very happy not to because they get to do whatever they want to; primarily establishing and expanding settlements. That is why Israel are the child murderers, because they alone could stop it (and because you'd negate the death of any adult as a militant anyway). You'll say how if Hamas had their way Israel would be wiped out, well no shit, you shove someone in a cage and poke at them and take away all hope they will get mad. And then you'll equate all Palestinians with Hamas.

So the reason people downvote you is because you're all over this thread defending what, yes, everyone has already come to the conclusion is indefensible-- without the motivators of bias that you have. And because they don't want to get into a long draw out argument with a group of zionists that argue for their job (often literally), and will pick apart anything regardless of how tangential to the point it is. I don't actually think you're a shill, just some jewish kid who has a biased perspective.. I can only hope that one day you will free yourself of it, or at the very least realise it is not something worth defending.

And yeah, I too am not interested in a long discussion about this, I've wasted enough time already and think it would be disingenuous anyway.

Nowhere in that BBC article does it actually explain how they've come to a figure of 0.5% of GDP though. The closest they come is this:

""In the UK, for example, value added tax (VAT) on gas and electricity is 5% rather than the 20% charged on most other goods.""

Thing they don't say here is that same 5% vat rate applies regardless of the source of the energy. Renewables and fossil fuels get it alike, so it isn't a fossil fuel subsidy, it's an energy use subsidy.

&gt;and you should note that China is cleaning up and world leader in renewable energy subsidies now...

China is dumping a lot of money into solar subsidies no doubt, and it's severely depressing the price of solar panels worldwide. Seems like they're trying to eradicate the competing in the US and Germany by selling the panels at a loss, thus giving them a monopoly on supply.

null,false,Jellyfish_McSaveloy,eng-kent,Kent,null,"&gt;Well my contention is that their ideology - when compared to the alternative - is rather focused on attacking the poor out of poverty rather than helping them. It's a sort of ""tough love"" approach. Individualism over helping the society. Which is weird to me. It's like hiring a plumber who believes that your pipes are your own responsibility.

Its none of the sort. Its more that they wish state involvement is to a minimum, and this is often detrimental to the poor rather than the rich. Its not like Cameron sets out to screw the poor over, they believe their methods benefit them in the long run. Misguided rather than malicious.

&gt;Not sure why Capitalism is something out governments can't contend with. That makes it sound like some superliminal being that's guiding us. It's an economic system which could use some tweaks if you ask me.

Its definitely a function of capitalism because investments create wealth far better than labour ever will. It inevitably leads to the wealthy acquiring wealth at a pace unmatched by those with a simple 9-5, as it should.

&gt;I find the arguments about inequality always a little silly. You have someone always arguing that inequality is a good thing. Drives people to do stuff. Like the other side is seriously considering eliminating inequality entirely - like that's even ever been mentioned as a possibility. As far as I've read high levels of inequality are bad for economies. But you know even if they weren't I'd be against them.

No one is saying inequality is a good thing, what I'm saying is that battling inequality for the sake of it (Rawlsian Theory) isn't something I believe in. Under that theory, Rawls states that society will be happier if the poor for poorer so long as the rich were even worse off as opposed to if the poor was richer and the rich was even richer.

&gt;Poverty may be relative. The poorest in Britain may have more than they ever had - rising tide raises all boats and all that - but it's still a pretty hopeless existence. Rich people even almost literally (hyperbole) aren't held accountable by the same laws. We see the powerful protected. You read a story of fraud, laundering and tax evasion costing the country billions but when I need two weeks to try and send some CVs and get a job I'm sort of just told to fuck off I should have saved.

This is exactly Rawlsian theory. It didn't matter during the boom years of Labour under Blair when everyone was doing well.

Now I'm not saying income inequality is good. I'm stating that we should look at it from a different perspective.

&gt;Take two examples from the front page of the private eye. 2% cut in corporation tax gives away £2.5bn annually (mostly to the largest companies) - which is a bit more than they removed from child and family elements of tax credits. It goes on to criticise it as tax haven behaviour.

Corporation tax cutting is a large debate that you don't give enough credence to. Since the 80s corporation tax has halved yet consistently increased in revenue. Lowering coporation tax and shutting down tax avoidance holes should go hand in hand and is something I agree with.

Until we have a unified tax system worldwide, corporation tax will continue to trend down as we have countries compete against each other for investments.

&gt;Or how about the inheritance tax which seems to actually leave out Lord Rothermere for the moment.

Hugely unpopular tax from the middle class upwards or anyone who lives in London. Doesn't generate much revenue. Good change.

&gt;They believe their policy is hitting the most vulnerable hardest. For full disclosure they were mostly talking about families with disabled people in. Who now have a higher poverty rate than pensioners.

The unfortunate reality is the most vulnerable will always feel the worse effects of the economy and benefit from the booms the least. Austerity will never help the poor, recessions will always hot them hardest, and they will never out pace wealth creation during booms.

Conservative ideology with a small state clearly believes that in the long term a better welfare state can be established, with more jobs being created with lower taxes, competing private companies in providing a service etc. Its all great in theory, but the reality of it is often very different, and this applies to the ideology on the other side as well.

The Tories were flinging all that crap at labour, and the retorts could have been simple and damning. It would have been so easy to bury Cameron under the weight of his own lies, but nobody did it. 

Brown only overspent in hindsight, and while you can argue that he saw the banking crisis coming, there was still fuck all he could have done about it. Added to that, we were doing bloody well up until the crash. Didn't brown have us running at a surplus for a couple of years, too? All labour has to do is point to the facts - brown didn't cause the recession, he didn't overspend, he didn't leave the coffers empty and that Osborne's criminal mismanagement has slowed out economy to a trickle for many more years than needed. Ask they have to do is point to the huge list of companies, big and small, who went under in the first years of Cameron's government, all they have to do is point out how much worse off the working poor are thanks to the benefits cuts. It's laughably easy to successfully rebuff every claim Cameron made and his successor will make, but nobody's doing it!

Also, austerity has to end sometime. Cameron got in this time on the ticket of a job half finished... Well it's already looking, from Osborne's latest targets, that they're not going to have finished the job in five years time... All a decent labor party has to do is ask Cameron - or whoever's in charge by 2019 when it ends, when do we stop making the sick, vulnerable and working poor bleed. 

The Tories won not because the population thought they were the better choice, but because they thought the opposition were incompetent and unrepresentative, which they were and remain. Whether it's as a centre party under one of the other three, it s leftist party under corbyn, if they can just get their act together and gather the balls to actually attack cameron instead of sucking the sweat from his plastic ballsack, they'll start to look electable again.

I am also a bit of a Nintendo fan, so would happily swap for some half decent Nintendo stuff. 

I am going away on Friday morning, so that is the latest that I will post.

They knew, so why say it? I can't think of any other reason other than they wanted to have that idea floating around the press as a rumour to introduce a favorable outcome in the public relations aspect.

The pathologist was just repeating what an unnamed officer had told them. That part of the even isn't even relevant to what a pathologist does. 

A pathologist would only really be interested in the actual scene of the death- as that is the only part relevant to their job. It could have been that the officer wasn't even there when de Menezes went through the barrier, and just said what he had heard. It was an off the cuff remark that wasn't even relevant to the pathologists report, and it was the pathologists mistake to include it, not the officers. 

As I said before, the police themselves were very upfront with what had happened, and told the family almost immediately. 

&gt;'a woman', no name? no source? Stinks that to be honest.

Not really. The reason it came to the papers attention was the the family of de Menezes was upset that the police had asked for a DNA sample to clear him. They are the ones who thought he was trying to be smeared. Why would the police take the sample and then clear him so quickly if they were trying to smear him?

 &gt; Wake up at 6am, make a coffee, kick the missus out of bed, shit shower shave, 3 cigarettes and a train. In town for half 7 in the office for before 8. Watch the numbers go up or down on the Fidessa screen (boss likes Fidessa, I'd prefer FactSet, ho hum) for about 10 minutes, then I go outside and whip some poor people, throw maimed children into wells, that sort of thing. Got to use up all that time before lunch, you know? 
 
 &gt; So, we get to lunch, usually I'll go to Goucho or similar and order a very large steak and an obscenely expensive bottle of wine, think the lunch equivalent to your mortgage. Because of all the cocaine I stuffed up my nose during the pauper-whipping or children drowning I'm not usually all that hungry, so I just throw my wine all over the place while shouting loudly about my achievements to similar smooth features psychopaths, they're not interested, and nor am I really but you know, if it gets too quiet the vapid emptiness of our lives builds to a deafening crescendo, so we've simply got to fill the void, even if it's just faceflapping.   
 
 &gt; One day a week I make it back to the office after lunch, where I'll throw a ball of receipts at one of the lowly HR gnomes to sort through and spend it dodging phone-calls from my clients telling them all sorts of things I've read in Citywire or Investment Week that I don't really care about but we've got these journalists for a reason. Essentially, we just blindly throw client money at whatever the fuck the buzzword of the day at the moment is and then back it up with whatever we read in the paper. Mea Culpa? Fuck no. *Momentum* investing, we do what the market does. Yeah, that sounds good, we'll go with that for the moment.   
 
&gt;  The rest of the time that I don't go back to the office I'll just stay in the pub until it's time to go to the gent's club or the golf course. The gent's club is basically a big house somewhere with lots of rooms that look like old livings rooms where we all sit and laugh at how poor you lot are, and the golf club is a golf club. Where I play golf with similarly wealthy people.  
 
 &gt; There. I think that's all the stereotypes isn't it? Good.  
 
&gt;  In all honesty, I work really hard. I studied really hard. I don't get a chance for fun during the week, and I'm tired on the weekend. The things you see on TV and in movies is largely bollocks. Your stockbroker doesn't drive a lambo or throw champagne around, they probably drive a 5 year old Skoda superb, live in a regular 3 bedroom in a suburb and go on the same holidays as you. The arseholes in the big institutions, yeah there's some of them around, but they don't live like in the movies either.    
 
&gt;  We get up early. We read a lot. We speak to brokers and get as much information as we can. We try to keep costs low, and we try to pass that on. We're friendly. We get phonecalls on Saturday mornings from clients, and Sunday nights we think about the week ahead. We talk you and your friends through things in the pub. We get shit thrown at us for being part of an evil industry when a couple of cunts ruin it, when all we want to do is make some money for you, because that's our job. We're mostly not-too-shit at it either. It takes a lot of work and thinking and sometimes balls.  
 
  &gt; We're hounded by compliance, we're hounded by the FCA, we're hounded by the media and everyone thinks we're  cunts.

The exception shows the rule. In the world we are discussing the worst has already happened but since judges (who here are the exception) are not corrupt justice can still be achieved. You didn't explicitly say it, but everything depends on it hence the exception shows the rule, ie not only are the police/CPS, corrupt they were corrupt in this instance; otherwise our entire conversation has no basis. 

&gt;I think on balance Judges are for more likely to be non-corrupt than corrupt.

I don't know how much I disagree with this. I have a sense that's it likely true. Even the police are generally OK people doing an OK job of things but I figure that's mostly not down to the design of the system but to the personal qualities of the officers themselves. At some tiny level of corruption we can say that it doesn't matter, we can certify the system free of corruption. Until we get to that point the system remains corrupt.

This we just disagree on I guess. I think that minority parties should be given a chance. You think they are all rapid extremeists. Hell, look at the major parties running Poland and Russia. The minority parties there are much more in line with the UK in terms civil rights at least.  
&gt;The voting system is not obliged to make sure your vote changes anything.  

OK I phrased myself very badly there, and you have a good point. But the vote of a Green or UKIP voter should be equal to that of a Labor or Tory voter. The Greens got 1.15 millions votes and the Conservatives 11.3 millions. But they achieved 1 and 330 seats respectivly.  
How does that mean that a Green vote and a Tory one are equal. My problem is that whilst my vote should not have more chance of changing things than anyone else, it also should not have less. Currently I vote in Stoke so my vote has 0 chance of changing and election outcome. However someone living in a swing seat, their vote could change at the very least their own MP.  
&gt;No government in the UK has ever been able to claim, that a majority of the electorate supports them.
So at least we could say that the parties involved had between them. At least 50%+ of voters would have had some influence on the agenda. Currently the Tories get to exact their entire manifesto, despite only 36.8% of the population haivng voted for them.

We moved back to Glasgow with a young child. We had to take what we could get. I was happy enough with the job for a few years - there were plenty of fringe benefits. The main one being that the boss took every request of mine into consideration. I could pretty much work when I wanted to (without taking the mick, obviously). That's absolutely invaluable when you have a small child to look after.

My partner lost his (better paid) job several years ago and had trouble getting back into work. When he did, it was in a job that's been leaving him both mentally and physically exhausted for over four years now - he's been wanting to find something else, but he hardly has the energy. Whatever he's applying for, he never hears anything back.

For me, the plan was to stick with the job for a little bit more but also go to uni next year. We've had a change in management at work and the situation's become so untenable that I've handed in my notice. My new job's not going to pay much better, but my quality of life will hopefully improve.

But, assuming we will be clearing out some players the remainder of the window, it wouldn't be an awful idea to continue strengthening the squad. Particularly at the back. 1 more fullback and maybe a central defender wouldn't be bad IMO.

At fullback, assuming we can offload Enrique, we have: Moreno, Clyne, Flanno, Gomez and Wisdom. That's 3 that can play left, but only 1 that is a natural left. I think we should add another natural left.

Miliband's Labour team also doesn't understand the economy at all. There was a joke that the only reason Balls was made shadow chancellor was because he was the only one who could count. This was obviously hyperbole but there were times when I wondered just how hyperbolic it was.

Miliband also had an authoritarian streak which I didn't like at all. Banning criticism of Islam for one and I have been pleasantly surprised by how liberal the Tories have been in this regard. (I pay attention to actual policy not rhetoric) There's a great economist article on this.

I also adore Osborne. He's saved this country from falling into the quagmire that is the rest of Europe right now.

Also Labour's non-stop attacks on business were silly and screamed of populism. I believe in a social safety net but you need someone to pay for that. Miliband's Labour fell into the classic leftist trap of wanting all the benefits but presenting no way of paying for it.

There's certainly no shortage of discussions along those lines on UK/political subreddits.

Sometimes I think the issue that 'white' people have (or maybe those from majorities) is not being able easily to identify the line between normal discussion/criticism and insulting behaviour when it comes to issues involving a relevant minority. So you get some people who avoid them at all as it is easier, and those who go ahead anyway and try to cover themselves when they go too far by complaining about political correctness or whatever. It's awkward, and complicated. But neither hiding from it, or abusing it to get away with being rude, seem like sensible solutions to me.

Another problem seems to be that some people forget that identity labels have a degree of subjectivity, and are statistical rather than individual. It may be that a particular group may be statistically overrepresented in a particular issue, but that doesn't mean that we can apply that to any individual, and should be careful about drawing conclusions on that basis. Which is something that Nihal brought up.

We've seen this with the Rotherham stuff, where the majority attitude has been to blame one minority group, and then within that minority group the majorities blame a subgroup, and so on and so on.

And the Rotherham reports *didn't* conclude that the fear of being labelled racist was a major factor - it was mentioned as a potential factor in one of the reports, and then that became the headlines.

Which changes to the labour market? There certainly weren't any proposals to liberalise the laws on, for example, trade unions which are some of the most authoritarian in the Western world.

He looks funny eating a bacon sandwich and comes across badly in pro-Tory media.

&gt;Miliband also had an authoritarian streak which I didn't like at all. Banning criticism of Islam 

Complete fantasy based on nothing. The Labour Party is an authoritarian party which supports restrictions on free speech and is totally committed to mass surveillance... just as the Tories are. If you actually think that the Labour Party was going to ban criticism of Islam though... wow. If you think that those in the party to the right of Miliband are less authoritarian on civil liberties then.. well.. you are wrong.

&gt;He's saved this country from falling into the quagmire that is the rest of Europe right now

More fantasy. Britain stayed in the recession longer than many other European countries.

&gt;Also Labour's non-stop attacks on business were silly and screamed of populism. I believe in a social safety net but you need someone to pay for that. Miliband's Labour fell into the classic leftist trap of wanting all the benefits but presenting no way of paying for it.

More fantasy. Labour actually attempted to position themselves as tougher on benefits, Rachel Reeves promised to be [tougher on benefits](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/12/labour-benefits-tories-labour-rachel-reeves-welfare) than the Tories.

&gt;The most detailed breakdown yet of global fossil fuel subsidies has found that the US government provided companies with $5.2bn for fossil fuel exploration in 2013, Australia spent $3.5bn, Russia $2.4bn and the UK $1.2bn. Most of the support was in the form of tax breaks for exploration in deep offshore fields.

So that article was back talking about exploration subsidies, which we've already been through - We take ten times as much in tax back once the field is up and running.

We'll also ignore that ~£750 million in tax breaks for oil/gas exploration is nothing like 0.5% of GDP anyway.

null,false,Flower_Fairy,null,null,null,"&gt; A recent Home Office study suggested treating possession as a health issue rather than a criminal offence, as it is in other countries, could reduce death and infection rates. The report looked at models in countries such as Portugal, where the possession of small quantities of any drug has been decriminalised.
&gt; 
&gt; Release, a charity that provides advice and information to the public on drugs and drug law, says the success of decriminalisation initiatives such as that adopted by Portugal need to be properly considered, instead of being ""blindly dismissed by the Government"".
&gt; 
&gt; ""Increasingly around the world we are seeing more liberal approaches being adopted by countries who rightly recognise drugs to be a health rather than a criminal issue, yet the UK remains woefully out of step on the issue,"" said project coordinator Edward Fox.
&gt; 
&gt; However, David Cameron has insisted evidence showed current legislation was working. “I don’t believe in decriminalising drugs that are illegal today, he said recently. “I’m a parent with three children – I don’t want to send out a message that somehow taking these drugs is OK and safe because, frankly, it isn’t.”

I can comfortable say that as someone involved in the Labour party. And I can cofortable say most of those involved with the party on one level do not want Corbyn as leader. Most CPL have gone for Liz or Andy. 

What is pushing Corbyn support up is the Unions because of this one member one vote and the fact you can become a supporter of the party to vote the Unions still hold massive power. 

It is easy to say Scotland was lost because Labour moved away from the left. But it is far far deeper then that, contact rates in Scotland where around 2% compare that to London where it sits around 60-70%. They did no campaigning because they fought well we are going to win so what is the point. And the SNP started to grow and it was looking likely they would win seats the Scottish Labour party just gave up and put the smallest amount of effort in. 

Corbyn isn't the right person to lead the party as while being a nice guy politically he isn't anything and will be eaten up. 

Andy Burnham isn't the right person either has he has a massive dislike for the South and London.

Once Carroll is back on his feet I'd expect Zarate to be dropped in his favor, otherwise I feel it is going to take some time for some of the new boys (Obiang, Ogbonna, and Lanzini) to really begin to make their presence known in the starting XI. 

We have a lot of pace and energy with this set up and there should be plenty of creativity and attacking intent in the final third. However we may get out-muscled up front and in some parts of mid-field. If we give Payet, Zarate, and Valencia free reign to roam around in the final third and really work off each other then they will be a nightmare to deal with. If Bilic decides to keep them moving down the wings then I don't think they will be as effective.

Sorry that's the point I thought I was making. Their ideology disproportionately affects the poor. I actually do think some of it is based out of contempt for and a lack of understanding of poverty. But that's a different discussion. We both seem in agreement that their politics affects the poor and that's fine. 

&gt;Its definitely a function of capitalism because investments create wealth far better than labour ever will. It inevitably leads to the wealthy acquiring wealth at a pace unmatched by those with a simple 9-5, as it should.

I agree it's a function of capitalism. I'm saying it isn't out of our control to help fix it. Unfettered capitalism leads to, as you say, the wealth being collected at the top. This is a problem in my opinion.

&gt;Now I'm not saying income inequality is good. I'm stating that we should look at it from a different perspective.

What's that perspective then? 

&gt;Corporation tax cutting is a large debate that you don't give enough credence to.

I just quoted a private eye article. I'm not sure how I feel about corporation tax. I'm not out to tax corporations for the sake of it for a misplaced feeling of justice. But I thought we were all being austeric. I don't want to fix the cracks in the economy with the little money poor people have. It also seems there has been a lot of debate to whether we even needed austerity and whether that's even what the Conservatives did. 

&gt;No one is saying inequality is a good thing, what I'm saying is that battling inequality for the sake of it (Rawlsian Theory) isn't something I believe in. Under that theory, Rawls states that society will be happier if the poor for poorer so long as the rich were even worse off as opposed to if the poor was richer and the rich was even richer.

I wanted to tackle this point last because I think this is the crux of the misunderstanding. I don't think inequality is a problem in and of itself. I think the levels of inequality are rising. I think they're a symptom of a sick society. I'll add this to your point about your ""unfortunate reality"". It just paints such a bleak outlook. 

As long as we are part of boom and bust we have lower economic groups with increasingly small window of social mobility who are near enough held incredibly accountable for all their small misgivings and misfortunes. We then have a wealthy class of people with all the real and soft power they could want. They'll live longer, live more fulfilled, create more, eat better and never feel consequences like the poor do. And apparently this is an absolute necessity.  

My honest hope is that technology comes along and frees us from some of these awful ""realities"". 

&gt;Conservative ideology with a small state clearly believes that in the long term a better welfare state can be established

My problem with this is the long term part. They aren't really interested in helping people in the interim. Taking away the safety nets before you've changed society to suit them is just gonna make lots of unhappy people with no prospects. Given that wealth is inherited it's awfully unmeritocratic. 

I honestly feel there are steps we can take to make things less awful for the poor and it mostly centres around getting more money to them. Whatever the passed few governments have been doing is having the opposite effect. They're either fucking awful at their jobs or that isn't what they want to do.",null,0,null,1437586147,null,0,false,0,ctcbr60,null,t3_3e4pm2,null,t1_ctcbr60,null,t1_ctc7t1l,null,null,null,1438096330,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I actually think Valencia is stronger in the air than Sakho, but that's splitting hairs; with the possible exception of Zarate (who may not even qualify, I think he's more of a 10 or even a false 9) I'd say aerial dominance is one of our overall strengths in attack.

This would be a fine argument, if the reasons for the Lib Dems' self-destruction were to do with their ideological position - that's obviously not the case. People voted against the Lib Dems because they're *the Lib Dems*, with all that entails after the past five years - not because of their spot on the spectrum. 

&gt;If voters truly wanted centrist politicians, then they would have voted Lib Dem. Instead, it turns out that under our broken FPTP system, the largest minority group was the tories / 'Labour broke the economy believers', and thus the rest of us are stuck without representation - due in large part to the inability of the Labour Party to offer a credible alternative to the tories - as the SNP kept helpfully reminding them to no avail - though the results in Scotland clearly show that the anti-tory message worked for Sturgeon and Co.!

null,false,Jellyfish_McSaveloy,eng-kent,Kent,null,"&gt;I agree it's a function of capitalism. I'm saying it isn't out of our control to help fix it. Unfettered capitalism leads to, as you say, the wealth being collected at the top. This is a problem in my opinion.

Wealth will always collect at the top is my point. Income inequality wouldn't be an issue if the baseline was higher. The only long term solution to this is honestly basic/citizen income.

&gt;I just quoted a private eye article. I'm not sure how I feel about corporation tax. I'm not out to tax corporations for the sake of it for a misplaced feeling of justice. But I thought we were all being austeric. I don't want to fix the cracks in the economy with the little money poor people have. It also seems there has been a lot of debate to whether we even needed austerity and whether that's even what the Conservatives did.

The idea is that lower corporation tax encourages business growth and investments, which leads to higher tax revenues in the long term and a net benefit to all citizens. Obvious practical issues of tax avoidance, other end of Laffer curve etc.

Honestly its far harder to gauage the effect of corporation tax than many say.

&gt; I honestly feel there are steps we can take to make things less awful for the poor and it mostly centres around getting more money to them. Whatever the passed few governments have been doing is having the opposite effect. They're either fucking awful at their jobs or that isn't what they want to do.

Another symptom of our society is that our governments, for the better and the worse, are short term. We gear them towards short term benefits to win elections over long term gains.

The world governments are all short sighted because of this. Why else do we have populist policies against academic recommendation? Why else do they do the minimum for climate change? 

Captalism is currently our best model as a fragmented function society. If we can somehow miraculously ensure that the economy never falls into recession, it doesn't matter if income inequality continues to rise as long as the base line for families continue to rise above inflation.

Unfortunately that is impossible. We do live in a far bleaker world than we realise, as we are luckily residing in a country that can afford us the benefit of discussing this over the internet, in a home etc. 

&gt;My honest hope is that technology comes along and frees us from some of these awful ""realities"".

We should already be there to be honest.

This accident doesn't seem at all surprising when you consider where the motorcyclists was as the lorry was taking the manoeuvre. They *need* to take up space on the opposite side of the road, unless you want money wasted on repairing kerbs. 

Unfortunately, HGVs do need to use roads simply not made for them. Some items are simply too big for smaller vehicles, not to mention the costs involved for customers, contractors etc to make alternative arrangements.

If the UK wasn't such an aged country, roads could have been enlarged to accommodate larger, wider vehicles. Unfortunately we are too stubborn and proud of our historically small roads for our own good.

And honestly I'm not sure there's any way Scotland or any of the smaller nations in the UK can ever feel like valued member when their parliaments have so little power, and because the Union is inherently unequal, with England making up 85% of the population, with it's parliament also functioning as the UK parliament. And sadly as far as many people (including many politicians and media) in the UK are concerned England *is* the UK. The only way the Union can survive in the future is through federalisation, either splitting up England into smaller chunks with their own parliaments or giving each country far more autonomy.


Edit: And anyway, if the UK government decides that independence is inevitable, then why would you want them to *consolidate* power? Surely if you wanted them to ""act in the interests of the future UK"" then the first part of that would be to formally separate the economies of the two countries? If you wanted the UK to prepare for an independent Scotland then shouldn't they be looking to give them devo-max? 

The reason the UK gives Scotland money in the first place is because the UK government refuses to give them meaningful tax and borrowing powers, pretty much any money that Scotland gets from it's economy goes to the UK government first, and is then sent back to Scotland as a sort of grant, surely they should have to power to raise the money themselves?

Haha I almost asked about this when I replied. If either of us had mentioned it earlier it probably would have saved a lot of time. Not that I haven't enjoyed the discussion. Pretty much what I think the only solution is. Everything else just seems like jiggerypokery to meet the same ends.

&gt;Honestly its far harder to gauage the effect of corporation tax than many say.

Agreed. I'm not comfortable with the message it sends when we tax the poor and help corporations but I understand it helps in the long run.

&gt;Captalism is currently our best model as a fragmented function society.

Agreed.

On the point of inequality. I guess I wouldn't mind as much if money were less important. Think about what money can also get you. Power, influence, exemption from justice. It's not hard to look at what some of the rich and powerful do with that money. The effect on society is huge. Entire narratives seem to be drawn from board rooms of investors. That's hyperbolic of course, but hopefully you get my point. But again I think the underlying problem is that people don't have the time or money to stay informed. UBI has the potential to fix pretty much most of these.

&gt;We should already be there to be honest. Basic income is the next logical step for western societies, although I am slightly sad that I most likely will not see it in my lifetime.

As someone who used to study robotics I'm actually pretty hopeful that these changes will come quicker than we realise. If we allow it. We're on the cusp of automating transportation. Not just personal but entire industries, from trucks to warehouses.

* Cashiers
* Secretaries

Scottish Labour's main arguments have been 'only Labour can stop the Tories', 'only Labour can protect our public services and welfare state', and 'the SNP can't achieve anything at Westminster (because they have too few MPs)'.

By taking these seats (and putting a lot of publicity on the welfare bill second reading) what the SNP are saying is 'Labour won't stand up to the Tories no matter how many MPs they have', 'Labour aren't defending the welfare state', and 'the SNP are the only party standing up to the Tories at Westminster'.

These are essential arguments for a party that only stands in 59 seats, and especially with the Holyrood election just around the corner and wavering Labour voters being a key target.

You can see this narrative being built all over the articles they're writing and their social media presence, particularly with the new catchphrase of ""what are Labour for?""

'Interfering in markets' is a feature of markets and capitalism and has been from their creation. 'The market' is not some kind of autonomous self-correcting gaia, and in its present form it would have absolutely collapsed if it wasn't for the biggest nationalisation of the losses of the financial sector in history. Every single government presiding over a capitalist economy has 'interfered' in markets, including notorious leftists like Reagan, Churchill and Thatcher. How do you think markets in their modern form were created in the first place? Google the enclosures, you have a lot of reading to do.

&gt;The UK has performed significantly better than all over European countries post recession despite having a far bigger exposure to financial services. Have you seen our unemployment data? Let's start there shall we.

Again, the UK remained in recession for longer than many other countries in Europe and while the current unemployment statistics don't look too bad they have come at great cost to the most vulnerable in society. Workfare, traineeships and 'apprenticeships' ensure that the figures stay low but they ensure that the poorest are either in the same or a worse position than if they were simply unemployed. 

I'd love to see a source for Ed Miliband apparently wanting to ban criticism of Islam. Outside of bizarre racist websites like the BNP website I cannot find any credible claims that he wanted to ban criticism of Islam. Hint: increasing the punishments for actual attacks, and for things that are already illegal and motivated by racial hatred, is not the same thing as banning criticism of Islam.

It is not about you have to agree to every decision the club makes but your disagreement is nonsensical.  I really like Mata as a player but he was never a Mourinho man because he couldn't defend.  Mourinho has the best defensive record in ever team he has managed.  Luis was never a Mourinho man no matter how good he is offensively.  Mourinho requires all the defenders to be able to defend and even the wingers to defend.  He was never going to be our first team player.  You cant just compare player for player but whether the player fit the team.  Luis wasn't a good fit as our dL back up.

I mean even Cech he had to go.  It is just the way it is.  It is about team balance and harmony and the finance matter too even we are not lacking in that department.  It doesn't make sense to keep a first team player on roster as a back up.

So you were vexed about Luis going who isn't even all that, you must be off you nuts we lost Cech too because we are 'weaker'?  Should we have held Cech to the last year of his contract?

If you want a discussion, then tell me what do you think is in important in creating a winning team.  It just seems to me you don't have any consideration for team balance and dynamics.  Players aren't just numbers on a screen that you can buy and sell.  There is the human consideration too or all the big clubs would have all world class reserve players in their team.

Total rubbish. Alcohol can cause permanent brain damage in the long term (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome) aswell as short-term psychotic episodes as a result of binge drinking. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernicke%E2%80%93Korsakoff_syndrome

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDcyBXJAZNM

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol-related_brain_damage

Also, people who become severely addicted to alcohol and then suddenly try to stop cold turkey undergo a proccess called DTs, which stands for Delirium Tremens. This affects the brain so severely that it causes severe hallucinations, seizures, and even death.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium_tremens

(In case you didn't know, this doesn't happen when you try to quit smoking weed)

You can't ""think"" weed is more toxic than alcohol, because it isn't true. You can't have an opinion on something which is a fact.

the simple fact is we dont know enough about cannabis to say what the effects really are - all we have is anecdotal evidence and the reason for that is because it is illegal.

science isnt the reason its illegal either. the only reason weed is illegal is because the politicians say it is, and the only reason the politicians are keeping it illegal is because they think the general public thinks its bad. 

The whole thing is just a farce of epic proportions. on one hand we have the home office saying it has no medical value, but on the other they are granting licences to companies like GW Pharma so they can cultivate and sell weed extracts to the NHS for profit.

You need to list any obligations you have first of all. Credit card debt, student debt, etc. take this away from your monthly income after tax. Then you need to consider necessary costs you will have to pay. So: food, bills (gas, electricity, water, Internet, tv license (?)), toiletries, entertainment, travel (drive to work? Need take into account car costs over the year, petrol, MOT etc. if not, bus or train ticket costs). You should be able to find some good estimate for these sort of costs online. E.g. Food for 2 people, £40-£70 per week. Over estimate things if you are not sure. After this you should have an idea of how much money will be left to divide between rent and savings. 

Next, have a look at average property prices in the area you want to buy in. Average nationally is I think £190,000. Ideally you want a 20% deposit minimum so you need to save around £38,000 to get the deposit (you will also want to look into emergency saving funds and think of other costs involved in buying a house such as furniture, moving, agent costs?) i think saving 20% of your income is not unreasonable so you could be saving around £6000 per year. If you are saving at this level does it keep you in the green when adding this to your other costs (+ rent). If so you could have a deposit down on a house in 7 years. Maybe longer if you put some towards other savings account. Find an account with a good interest rate to put this in.

How else should you react to people actively trying to do you harm? With open arms? Christian charity and forgiveness? Fuck that. They hate us, we hate them. They destroy our communities, our services, kill people with their benefit cuts and austerity measures, and they couldn't care less. They're bastards one and all. They can either renouce their disgusting Toryism and rejoin the human race or be treated the same way they treat scroungers and immigrants and single mothers - with dehumanising violent contempt.

They subscrive to a political ideology which venerates selfishness and cruelty and causes harm to those who are most vulnerable. I'm not prepared to overlook that just cos it makes them feel bad when they have to row in public with someone about it.

Toryism is a vile ideology and those who subscribe to it should be made to pay a price for their inhumanity. Bevan was quite right when he described them as lower than vermin. They have no sense of obligation to the world beyond their own narrow self-interest and they're motivated primarily by a desire to do harm to others, those beneath them.

I think this season is going to be an improvement on last. Obviously with the loss of Pearson and Cambiasso we're in a bit of turmoil right now but Ranieri is saying all of the right things and a couple of midfield signings will sort us out. I can see us finishing in a similar position to this year but less spectacularly - which for me would be an improvement. 
**2.** **Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?** (100 words max)  
Lots of City fans see Kramaric as the guy who's going to be our star player this year. He's now settled into the club and is (according to him) enjoying playing in preseason and having an opportunity to gel. I can see him blending well with better quality strikers up front and it will hopefully be a good season for him and us! 10/15 goals would be a great season for him

**3.** **How do you think the team will line up?**  

I can see us lining up 3512 

                      Schmeicel

          Huth     Morgan      Fuchs

Albrighton    King    Drinkwater     Schlupp 

                             Mahrez
              
                 Okazaki       Kramaric

The main problem was caused by the pest cabbage stem flea beetle (or its larvae at least). Unfortunately they are only partially controlled by the other major group of pesticides (pyrethroids). Anecdotally we heard of farmers putting on 9+ sprays to try to protect their crop, which was insane and likely far more damaging than the neonics probably were. The reality is that there is no control available to farmers in the worst hit areas, and it would be worth seriously considering other crops to grow. We have just made sure that if we have oilseed rape trials they aren't in parts of the country that are badly effected, but that obviously isn't an option for farmers who realistically would probably be better off finding another crop to grow in the worst places.

Also, to put it into context as well, some farmers are pissed that the ban on neonics isn't complete. They just can't use them as a seed dressing at the time when they would actually be most effective. Many feel that the half solution that we have currently is pointless, and that the EU should either ban them completely and move on or let them use the chemicals.

Also, GM would potentially offer a solution, but there aren't any CSFB resistant varieties in development that I am aware of.",null,0,null,1437592683,null,0,1437595034,0,ctcgdzm,null,t3_3e77zr,null,t1_ctcgdzm,null,t1_ctcdeks,null,null,null,1438100156,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

I know nothing about Baba, but Luis never played enough for me to be upset about his departure. Sure it is great to have a first-team caliber player as a back up, but from what I have read, we aren't going to lose much quality if Baba ends up as the replacement. The pessimistic comments in this sub can be somewhat annoying, given that the strength of the team has in no way diminished. I truly believe that most of it stems from their friends who support other teams getting to brag about signings.

The nationalisation of the railways, for example, doesn't say how it would be nationalised. While I *generally* support the idea *in principle*, it's a useless question without anything to explain how that would happen.

**Banning zero hours contracts.**

&gt;Labour proposed an apprenticeship guarantee, by which every school leaver who gets the grades would be able to begin a high-quality apprenticeship. 

&gt;The offer is part of a wider productivity plan, which would also **require large firms hiring skilled workers from outside the EU to create 100,000 apprenticeships over the parliament**, a move that would inevitably increase the cost of hiring foreign workers.

Arguably true but that was only because we fell further than other economies. Below is a link to UK vs the euro area since the conservatives came in power.  **We've grown more than the eurozone**. That's an economic fact.

We have take longer to get back to where we were pre financial crash but **we have grown every year since 2010**.That's another economic fact.

(sorry you have to alter the graph from 2012 ( default ) to 2010 but you get growth every year unlike eu, france even germany dipped in 2013.)

 In terms of employment and growth we are doing better than france italy &amp; spain and the only large economy doing better is Germany. Here is a list of EU countries by unemployment rate. **Uk has one of the lowest unemployment rates.**

I was bullied all through secondary school. Verbal but not physical. It was relentless. In corridors, classrooms, changing rooms. It was awful. I had extra curricular activities but that in no way balanced it out. My parents were very much of the 'turn the other cheek', ignore it, be the better person view. I've since moved on from my hometown but for a few years after if I was visiting I even got crap in the street.

It has had a lasting effect on me. My self esteem is very low. I do a good job of putting the mask on and it mostly gets me through life. Deep down though my view is still that people generally see me as vulnerable and easy to pick on.

I wish I'd had the balls to deal with the bullies head on. Verbally or physically. It would have given me the self respect that I wouldn't take it and I could look after myself.  When the bullying eased off it was when I grew much taller and I was more physically imposing. One day I walking alone with a group behind me taunting me. Something snapped and I waded into the group, lamped the ringleader and walked off. They were so shocked there were no reprisals.

I think it is far too easy for teachers and authorities to say to bullied kids 'just ignore it'. They don't want more aggro in school but it really does not help the kid.

I don't know what I'll say to my children if a similar situation occurs..I'd hope that they'd know I'd support them if they stood up for themselves. I'd probably be a little proud too.

If you keep it nice, you'll have a good chance of a decent re-sell value and a properly functioning bike for as long as you want to keep it.

Suarez came here after one of our worst seasons when he was highly sought after. I dont see why an old zlatan wouldnt consider us if we really went for him and told him he would be a guaranteed starter.  The thing is, we dont need him, and I doubt he would be a starter especially if studge gets fit. Strangely, united, city and arsenal are all in more urgent need of a striker like him at the moment so he'd probably have a better chance of starting at these clubs!

As for his record, he's won the Bundesliga handily twice on the bounce and faltered only in a knockout competition where a single off day can end the competition for you.  I never judged Mancini by his performances in the Champions League so it'd be unfair of me to judge Guardiola on his.

His managerial career has essentially consisted of taking one team, refining it's style a little and being globally dominant, followed by taking another team, fundamentally changing their entire playing style and being only nationally dominant.

I really think you're underplaying just how good his Barca was.  I'd get it if they all they did was win a bunch of silverware.  A lot of the top tier managers could take that bunch of players and win a bunch of things, but again, they're widely regarded as one of the greatest club sides the game has ever seen.  He took the footballing philosophies of Michels and Cryuff and took them further than anyone had previously seen.  That's not the work of some bum gifted the best players in the world.

null,false,guilty_of_innocence,null,null,null,"&gt; Most people would be fucking dumbstruck if you told them that Gordon brown was responsible for the longest period of economic growth Britain has seen in the modern era

You have to put that in context. 

1) **Firstly EVERY economy was growing from the late 90s to the 2008** financial crisis. Spain, Italy, Portugal [even Greece was growing every year from 1997](http://imgur.com/rTXLM4T). Economic growth was NOT an amazing or unique feat in the global economy of 1997 to 2008. Greece actually outperformed the [UK](http://i.imgur.com/5vbmNQi.png) over the period. 

2) In the 50's 60s &amp; 70's the keynsian economic policy almost deliberately created bubbles and then deflated them. *Comparisons to this era aren't like for like*. You are never going to get long periods of sustained growth in a deliberate boom &amp; bust, keynsian stimulus, economy.  The 80s saw a period of radical change in the management of the economy that settled in the mid 90s. Accurate historical like for like comparisons are difficult. Thus you have to consider comparisons with other countries as more relevant.

However there is no doubt that the stimulus package that G Brown got in the 2009 G20 was good for the global economy. 

**TL;DR**  The most accurate measure of a chancellors success is comparison to other similar countries at the time. **Almost ALL countries grew every year from 97 to 2008.

The audio recording which showed he did say what everyone had already agreed he had said? He said what he confirmed he had said when he talked about it the next day on national radio? The audio which confirms the report from the EU official? 



For the last time, no one is claiming he said anything other than what he said. Some object to it more than others. Some - quite comically - claim he did say it, but didn't really mean it. In this article for example not only did Hunt not mean it, but he also didn't mean his subsequent interview with a national radio station. Oh what yucks. 



Does this article bring anything new to the conversation? Did he make jokes about being a sexist, jokes that he later and has continually claimed actually reflect how he feels? Yes, yes he did. You can record it all you want, that's what he said. Hell, *after* all of these facts came out (none of which actually contradict anything) have the institutions turned around and apologized? Changed their minds? No, because nothings changed. He did what was claimed, he said what was claimed, every step of the way. You know what though?

&gt;That narrative took a major hit on June 24 when The Times obtained information that a European Commission report on the conference, based on the notes of a European Union official who attended the luncheon, gave a very different account of what happened. The report summarized Hunt’s remarks as follows:

&gt;“It’s strange that such a chauvinist monster like me has been asked to speak to women scientists. Let me tell you about my trouble with girls. Three things happen when they are in the lab: you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticize them they cry. Perhaps we should make separate labs for boys and girls? Now seriously, I’m impressed by the economic development of Korea. And women scientists played, without doubt, an important role in it. Science needs women and you should do science despite all the obstacles, and despite monsters like me.”

...

&gt;Another, Malaysian science journalist Shiow Chin Tan, provided a new detail: she told The Times that after his facetious comments about segregating the sexes, Hunt added that “men would be worse off for it.” While St. Louis has continued to insist that Hunt did not say “now seriously” or praise women in science, Blum has acknowledged that the purported transcript had “some of the right elements” and was a “polished version” of Hunt’s “somewhat fumbling actual talk.”",null,0,null,1437597876,null,0,false,0,ctck4fm,null,t3_3e8f6p,null,t1_ctck4fm,null,t1_ctcjwwn,null,null,null,1438102559,null,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23,null

I think you should be okay renting a flat without a UK bank account, as you can use the BIC/IBAN to transfer money from your home account. Most of the time letting agents don't care where the money comes from as long as it comes through. The only concern there is that they may be assuming that your payments will come through instantly, like ours do.

They fought to keep Vietnam because they thought they could still keep their Empire going. They voluntarily left most African countries once they were reassured that those countrie would be pliant towards France. 

Algeria was different. It had like a million French settlers that were 10% of the population. They lived in the best areas of the country especially around the coast and controlled the most fertile land. The entire economy was controlled by them and Algerians were their servants. The majority Algerian population who were the poorest had to pay the vast majority of taxes that the French were exempt from.

It was more than just a simple colony. It provided France on the opposite side of the Mediterranean with a lot of food supplies and the local Algerians could always be made to fight in French wars they had no stake in such as WW1.

It was paradise if you were European or an Algerian jew (the only natives the French treated nicely which alienated them from the rest of the country). Leaving Algeria and considering it to be just another African colony became impossible politically. The French Algerians were to numerous and too well off. The prestige of the country was also too much. It took years of brutal and vicious fighting for the French to realise they could murder their way to peace.

Perhaps that is true (and indeed if we understand 'the centre' as meaning, by definition, 'where most people are, at least at the time that the party is formulating policy' then it is not far from being necessarily true). Certainly, though, this is true too: some governments change what counts as the centre. Thatcher did this. Blair did it, too, I think (albeit to a lesser degree or only on some issues).

* Went to see a university councillor, who, after 6 weeks telling him my story told me that I was probably suffering from depression and anxiety, and that I should see my GP.
* Went to my GP (in my university's town), told him my story, and he told me that he had no idea what to do with mental health patients and that I should see someone else.
* Went to see my GP back home, told him my story, and he said I should start taking SSRI antidepressants, but couldn't formally diagnose me with anything as he wasn't a psychotherapist. I turned down the SSRIs, since I don't want to start taking pills for a condition I'm not sure I have, especially after hearing about the side effects from a freind who was on them (they made her constantly excited and hyper, but never actually happy). On the way out, he pointed me to some leaflets for a phone counselling service.
* Called the service, told them my story, and they offered me a 20 minute talking therapy appointment, via phone, in 30 day's time, with further appointments every 60 days after that, assuming they judged that I needed their help enough. They were only available on tuesdays and thursdays, 10-3, so I missed the appointment because I had work. They wouldn't let be make another one.
* Back at uni, went to a second councillor, told her my story, and she pointed me towards an outsourced online ""mindfullness"" course, that I couldn't open on my computer. She couldn't help me with that, because they were completely uninvolved with it, and I used up my 8 sessions with her without my condition improving at all. She referred me to a ""mental health access team"" in come clandestine sub-division of the NHS.
* After six weeks, I got a letter from the access team (they had sent me a letter three weeks after I was referred, apparently, but it never arrived), telling me to come to their clinic, in a town 40 miles away. I missed the bus, had to reschedule two weeks later, went again, told them my story, and they said that I *seriously probably* have anxiety and depression but they couldn't diagnose me, gave me a shopping list of 5 private-but-NHS-subsidised mental healthcare providers in the local area. By ""the local area"", I mean 100 miles away.
* My condition much worsening due to various reasons, I managed to somehow drag myself out of bed and phone up the 5 providers, who all initially refused to give me the time of day until I name-dropped the access team from before. They had various waiting times ranging from 10 weeks to 2 years (!). Since I was going back home from uni in 6 weeks, I ended up turning them all down.

In their favour, most of the NHS people I have spoken to, and the two councillors, were very polite and sounded like they honestly wanted to help, but they either had no idea how to, or weren't qualified, or had waiting lists stretching into eternity, and so on.

Consider: some party, call it LD, declines a coalition offer with another party, call it C (and obviously my naming is not accidental). Will the result, by political lights that are more aligned with the views of LD than C, necessarily be worse?

Yes, this choice by LD means that it has much less affect on policy (since it is not in government). Yet, it might (1) manage to be a better opposition (by the lights of LD, or even by other lights), and perhaps even (2) keep its own ideas alive better than it had done had it gone into coalition (although not, evidently enough, if LD is quick to reject any and all ideas that go badly at the polls).

Israel was born in an era with colonial mindset where Europeans thought they could take other people's land. What right did Europeans have to go to a country they weren't from and take it from the natives? Ask your self seriously that question. The vast majority of pro-Israeli people can't answer that question honestly. All they can do is deny that Palestinians existed as a people. Which isn't true.

It's really rich to complain about Hamas. Did Hamas exist when European Jews came up with the obviously false slogan ""A land without a people for a people without a land""? Did Hamas exist when Israelis ethnically cleansed the entire country? Did they exist when Israelis gave weapons to Christian terrorists to mass rape and murder 3000 innocent civilians?

Go and look up the ANC and their activities. They weren't happy with Aparthied South Africa. They weren't singing songs. They realised that Aparthied existed through the use of violence and would only die by violence. They killed a lot of people and they attacked South Africa. Bombing shops, mining roads and killing collaborators.

It is what people do when they are subjected to vicious oppression. You know what I think Israelis should do? Leave! There are plenty of places in America and Europe they can live. They will eventually because the Palestinians aren't giving up and the days when the West ruled the world is ending.

I'm very dubious about the 10 year old CCTV tapes, maybe your old school does theoretically have these tapes but it's by no means certain they'll still be viewable or that what is on there will be usable as evidence.  Unless you can pinpoint a precise day and time the assault could be anywhere in thousands of hours of footage, and the police won't have time to look through it for you. 

I would also say that while school bullying of this sort is horrible, nobody is the same person at 25 that they were at 15.  Adolescents do shitty things, but hopefully these girls have grown up a lot since then.  You have to consider whether you are angry enough or consider the assaults serious enough to want to pursue this ten years down the line.

&gt;In psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental stress or discomfort experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values at the same time, or is confronted by new information that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas, or values.[1][2]

Fossil fuels are currently subsidised, and diminishing, and we need an interim solution before fusion becomes viable (if it ever does). The only realistic option that is cost-effective with current technology is fission.

Unfortunately, nuclear power has two large drawbacks: public opposition and large up-front costs despite being cheaper in the long term. A government, with its ability to borrow more cheaply than the private sector, can overcome the second of these obstacles, but the first is more tricky.

However, if a government can convince the public of the merits of nuclear power, it can invest in publicly-run nuclear plants, as well as setting up a publicly owned consumer utilities provider. This would, over time, phase out privately-run fossil-fueled plants, and lead to an eventual government monopoly on power generation, and it would also be in a position to begin buying out private energy companies as they became marginalised.

Unfortunately, this would be a decades long project and is extremely unlikely when the Tories are likely to sell it all off again the next time they get into power, so would require overwhelming public support that doesn't exist at the moment, but a man can dream.",null,0,null,1437600892,null,0,false,0,ctcm5pg,null,t3_3e7yj8,null,t1_ctcm5pg,null,t1_ctcids9,null,null,null,1438103838,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

&gt;UEFA notes with satisfaction the ruling of the European Court of Justice [ECJ] dated 16 July in which it has declared ""manifestly inadmissible"" the recent request for a preliminary ruling on the legality of financial fair play made by the Brussels Court of First Instance [BCFI]

&gt;The European Court of Justice declared that request as pointless because the court making it [the BCFI] had already - in June 2015 - declared itself incompetent to rule on the merits of the so-called Striani case.

&gt;The European Court of Justice also observed that the national court had failed to provide any of the necessary information to enable the ECJ to address issues of European competition law.

&gt;The European Court of Justice has therefore had for the first time the opportunity to consider the financial fair play system, and has taken the view that the Striani case orchestrated in Belgium has no merits whatsoever.

&gt;UEFA considers this to be a sensible and logical outcome and takes the opportunity to reaffirm its complete confidence in the legality of financial fair play, a system which is backed by the overwhelming majority of stakeholders in European football and which has, in a short space of time, already delivered real, concrete and tangible results which will help safeguard the future and long-standing prosperity of the game in Europe.

Not the best, I read about this a while ago and I can't remember where I found it, but that gives a decent introduction. Basically, CBD can work against some of the negative effects caused by THC. A good, balanced bud actually has anti-psychotic properties. 

Towards the end of the flowering period, the bud is already as big as it will get, so yields won't increase if you give it the extra push to get the amber/cloudy mix on the trichomes that you want, unless you're a cancer patient and want basically full amber trichomes. It still gives people the fun high that most people seem to want, so that's what people get. Too much THC compared to CBD combined with a lack of sleep is a potentially devastating combination.

**Pension**: My pension is a corporate SIPP ""SMART Pension"".  Currently, it pays in 13% of my monthly gross pay - 5% from me, another 8% from my employer.  My employer's contribution goes up in step (to a certain limit) with my own contributions should I choose to raise them, but I can't afford to right now.  

After just shy of three years, my pot is worth a not very exciting *£13k*.  yay i can haz retirementz nao

**Savings**: I currently have around £25k after pulling some out to pay emergency expenses.  I can't really afford to save more than £500 a month right now (and not even every month) and I'm worried my balance isn't increasing quickly enough and my saving is stagnating.  

Aside from a house at some point, I have no real savings goals and I'm not sure what I'm saving for or how much I'll eventually need

**Investments**: I have shares in a corporate plan that will mature in small waves over the course of the next five years time.  All in and best case scenario, this should yield a grand total of somewhere in the region of £30k.

This will be slapped on top of my other savings to increase my housing deposit.

To be honest, I feel pretty screwed.  I do worry about money and ask questions such as what house prices etc. will be when I finally *think* I have enough.  What will the cost of living situation be like in, say, five years time?

He said: ""We have been taken aback by how the police decided to defend this case, and the line that they have taken in terms of trying to muddy Jean Charles's name and diminish him as a person and make the shooting more acceptable.
""He [the defence lawyer] was literally saying he was asking for it, which I thought was pretty sickening.""
The family accused the Met of allowing false claims that Mr de Menezes was a terror suspect to linger in the days afterwards.
False reports that he had been seen running from police, jumping over barriers and that he was wearing bulky clothing with protruding wires, were not immediately corrected by police.
Within a week of the shooting, it was leaked that the Brazilian's visa to stay in the UK had expired, which the Home Office then confirmed.
The leaks continued with claims that traces of cocaine had been found in his body, which were proved in court.
In March last year it was leaked that Mr de Menezes was being investigated in a rape case. He was cleared of any involvement.",null,0,null,1437603085,null,0,false,0,ctcnk1p,null,t3_3e65un,null,t1_ctcnk1p,null,t1_ctc8l7c,null,null,null,1438104369,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

1). The boom/bust cycle is not a factor unique to Corbyn. I agree though that whoever's leader this will hopefully play to our advantage.

2). I don't disagree that the cuts will start to affect those that haven't been affected by them, but that doesn't automatically mean they'll become Labour-supporters. The promise of tax-cuts worked for Thatcher and might do for whoever will be Tory-leader by 2020. We need someone as leader opposing these cuts that the public doesn't instantly dismiss as a member of the (I hate the term, but it's in common parlance) 'loony left'. 

3). The idea of an SNP/Labour alliance in parliament was one of the things that people in the rest of the UK felt most insecure about. Be pragmatic by all means, but a deal with the Scottish nationalists is not something we should aim at doing, ideally. Furthermore if we did need an alliance, the SNP was willing to do a deal with a 'pro-austerity, pro Trident' Milliband government before the election to keep the Tories out of Downing Street; why wouldn't they in 2020? 

4). This article does is right to mention the need to appeal to UKIP-voters, but why would [this man](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/06/08/jeremy-corbyn-bbc-newsnight-ukip-voters-motivated-by-racism_n_7539938.html) be the one for the job? 

5). Why couldn't any of the other candidates 'win a generation back' in 2020? The article cites Tony Blair's failings in 2001 and 2005, but fails to mention the 43.2% of the vote we got with him in  charge in 1997. I'm not especially a fan of Tony Blair, but I don't understand this whole idea that middle ground politicians can't inspire the electorate. Differentiating ourselves from the Tories by adopting a far-left position didn't win in 1983, and I don't believe it would today. 

6). *A lot* of left-wing policies are popular, and I agree that they should be in the 2020 manifesto, but *a lot* are not. I have no idea what policies a Corbyn-led Labour Party would support, but I have a feeling that if things like unilateral nuclear disarmament (for example - in fairness I'm not sure whether Corbyn would try to push this belief of his into the manifesto, but you get my point) were included, it could lose the party a lot of votes. Also, I don't see why any of the other leaders couldn't include some of the more popular policies. Yvette Cooper especially has spoken passionately about the need for a 'Labour alternative' to the Tory narrative.

If that's not just rhetoric, I increasingly think that she's our gal.

[So people in Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, Austria, Norway, Germany, France](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=REV) aren't aspirational? As an explanation from [here](http://www.oecd.org/social/OECD2014-FocusOnTopIncomes.pdf):

""*From the mid-1970s to the late 2000s, the United States average income grew at an annual rate of 1%. However, the vast majority of the population did not see their incomes rising by anything close to this rate. In fact, if one strips out the growth that went to the top 1%, the annual growth rate of the remaining 99% was only 0.6%. Excluding the top income percentile may also change considerably the country ranking in terms of annual income growth. For instance, average real income growth is lower in France than in the United States over the period, but France performed better than the United States when considering income growth of the bottom 99%.*""

Surely what is important is that everyone is prospering? To me it's evidently clear that this Conservative 'aspirational' low tax culture categorically does not lead to a prosperous future for the majority but rather the minority. What they're trying to push is what America already has, which has evidently failed to help their lower &amp; middle classes that now suffer from stagnated wages &amp; declining quality of life.

Man United have bought well but they will lose DiMaria which is really bad and their defence is still shaky. They too seem to lack a good balance. But they look to buy more players so its hard to tell just yet how big of threat they will be.
And Arsenal are just a joke. They can buy the best players in the world but they still wont win cause they have Wenger. And their team is full of instagram loving players who dont know how to win major trophies. The fact that they have bought Cech not just for his goalkeeping skills but for his ""winning mentality"" is just sad.

Now, around 400,000 hectares of oil seed rape is grown annually, roughly one eighth of the area of wheat and barley. Most of this is autumn sown and known as winter oilseed rape.

&gt; Oilseed rape is not a very high yielding crop by comparison with cereals. Typically winter rape yields around 3 tonnes per hectare compared with 8 tonnes per hectare for wheat. However, with a higher price and the ""break crop"" benefit to the following wheat crop, oilseed rape remains an important crop in the arable rotation and currently the UK is about 90% self sufficient.

And don't mention wages because he came in cheap vs a player like Lovren who cost more but is on lower wages, it evens out imo, same with Milner. 

Anyway I think he will go due to benteke coming in but I'd happy if he stays and improves.

To declare that at some arbitrary point along the process of pregnancy an unborn child goes from being a clump of cells and tissue that can be discarded at will to a human being with full legal rights is a highly problematic position logically and ethically. 

The part of the brain that allows a foetus to feel pain doesn't suddenly pop into existence around 24 weeks, it slowly develops along with every other human faculty. And if being able to experience pain is what makes one a human being worthy of the right to life does that mean people born with congenital analgesia are not human beings and we can just go and kill them at will?

The problem with ""neoliberal"" is that it's hard to pin down a meaning. It's becoming a bit like ""fascism"". As far as Orwell was concerned: “The word Fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies 'something not desirable'"".

I'd take it to mean  third-way Blairite policies, with a fairly large state delivering services via the private sector. By that definition, the Lib Dems, and certainly the Orange Bookers, are very much ""neoliberal"". 

Personally I'm very much against third-way Blairite Orange Booker policies; it falls in a dysfunctional space somewhere between socialism and the free market, combining the worst features of both. 

Nevertheless I mildly regret the annihilation of the Lib Dems because although they were ""neoliberal"" they were also the only party which seemed to genuinely have some support for civil liberties. Something very much lacking in the Labour and Conservative parties. 

&gt;with Labour being savaged every single day for being ""too Left"".

I don't think that was the case. Labour wasn't much to the left of the Conservatives, and the Conservatives have borrowed several of their policies. Labour was savaged because they were useless at playing the game of British politics. They failed to seize the narrative, they failed to be a credible opposition, they failed to exploit some of the previous government's obvious mistakes, they failed to retain and gain the key marginals. 

They were not ""too left"", they were incompetent.

That depends on how good he is at managing the media. Most of which admittedly won't be on his side. 

Then again, Labour gained prominence at a time when most of the media were against them and they could be painted as similar to the former Soviet Union. These days with social media it should be much easier to grab the narrative. 

But I guess what they really need to do is get the pensioners on board...which will be a challenge.

------

And just to clear up what psychosis and schizophrenia actually *are* in short, because there seems to be a great deal of misunderstanding IME; psychosis is some kind of loss of contact with reality, eg thinking everyone is plotting against you or such, and schizophrenia is a more rigorous diagnosis, like you must maintain the delusion for over 6 months.. while a psychotic episode may be much more brief.

It's really not hard to see that the paranoia that cannabis is well known to cause sometimes (exacerbated by its legal status) might be able to spill over into a psychotic episode in the wrong circumstances.",null,0,null,1437606377,null,0,false,0,ctcplp3,null,t3_3e7n3p,null,t1_ctcplp3,null,t1_ctcc3r1,null,null,null,1438105618,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

I don't want to be too optimistic in interest rates though. Basically all my spare cash is either going in my pension or Stocks and Shares New ISAs (in case I need some cash earlier).

If a foreign driver were caught committing an endorsable offence (I.e. One for which he would receive points) in the UK, then he would have a ""ghost"" driving record created in the UK by the DVLA and his points would be added to that. This goes for driving bans as well - if a Belgian lorry driver is caught drunk at the wheel in the UK, he will be banned from driving here but his Belgian license will not be cancelled and he will be able to return to Belgium and drive there.

Not only that, but failure to wear a helmet on a motorcycle or quad bike is not an endorsable offence in the UK - you can't get points on your license for it here.

So to answer your first question, I don't think you'll end up with points on your UK driving license for it.  I think they might create a ghost license for you in Greece and put points on that.

For your second question - the 14 days thing - again, I've never heard of it being used for riding without a helmet, but I believe it relates to the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) which, by law, must be served on a driver who commits one of a number of specified offences under section 1 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1998 (Schedue 1 of that act specifies the offences to which that section applies) within fourteen days of the date of the alleged offence, otherwise no prosecution can take place. There are only a few such offences, and riding without a helmet is not one of them; this means that the fourteen day prosecution limit does not apply.

I don't know anything about Greek law though, so if this is referring to a Greek prosecution time frame law then I wouldn't be able to advise you.",null,0,null,1437606953,null,0,1437610884,0,ctcpyim,null,t3_3e7qpu,null,t1_ctcpyim,null,t3_3e7qpu,null,null,null,1440466117,null,2,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,2,null

null,false,solaceinrage,null,null,null,"Those are just examples and many other shows could be substituted, I just rattled off what I would most like to see. Worst case scenario they pay a fee to distribute globally on shows that already have a large fanbase. For example, Talkback is unlikely to ever make it's own channel, but for a further licensing fee would allow BBCA to broadcast their shows in the US markets. Both receive profit for shows already made at little new cost.

 Being made by independents is par for the course, as NBC, CBS etc buy their shows from studios who create and pitch the shows to them. Whether it's Warner Brothers, Paramount, Viacom, 20th Century Fox etc. the network themselves creating major new properties is the exception instead of the rule. The USA network and HBO have had some success at it, but for the most part things just don't work that way.

Look up the BBC worldwide annual review for a comparison and you will see why I say the licensing fees are a pittance. They made nearly as much in the US market as their home market because cable in the UK costs about a fifth what I pay here for the most basic service, and as I said there is nothing besides Doctor Who that makes the barest hint of a blip in our ratings. If there were maybe a half dozen series like ""The IT Crowd"" (made by Channel 4) they would likely make as much off the one channel in the US per year as they make off the entire network in the UK, because their home share has been severely undercut by Dave and Sky TV. 

One of the things that really shocked me when travelling was just how much of our media is being piped into homes in the UK, not just the big ones like The Simpsons, but even shows like Big Bang Theory and Friends which were themselves recreations of your own shows. All I am saying is that I wish there were more coming back across the cultural divide than an angry chef, Bill Oddie and the Tardis. Many would like more of an equal exchange, and since a legitimate one is lacking they use a proxy instead. 

Maybe the BBC alone can't make that happen, but if Richard Branson or another with the connections and money to back such a venture ever turn their attention to it I believe it would be a huge success. There is a lot of great entertainment trapped bouncing around it's own tiny market that would explode and do very well abroad.

null,false,SandCatEarlobe,null,null,null,"&gt; Buy large cuts of meat that can be used in several ways, i.e. Instead of buying pork chops, buy a meat joint, have a roast, use the rest in a curry, casserole, stir fry etc. Make large batches and freeze them. If you don't have a freezer and don't have much room, the little desktop type ones are around £100 and work really well.

This is great advice. Switching chicken breasts for an entire roast chicken works very well for leftovers. 

&gt; Substitute fresh herbs for dried or buy herbs and freeze the rest so there is no waste.

A very good alternative is to get pots of some of your most frequently used herbs and plant them in your garden or in pots on your kitchen windowsill. The same applies to some other green, leafy things like spinach though they take up more space.

&gt; If you have any Turkish supermarkets nearby, utilise them. I especially find them cheap for fruit and veg. For example 4 red apples in Morrisons were £1.80 and £1 or less in my local Turkish supermarket. 

Good tip. The same applies to Aldi/Lidl, Asian grocers, and to street markets, especially farmers' markets. Some farms also sell directly to passers by.

&gt; Most supermarket deals move around. Eg if you only like Flora butter but not at £2.80 it will be £1 for a while in Co Op, then Tesco, Iceland etc.

Supermarket deals are brilliant for non-perishables. As if I need an excuse to buy ten bars of Lindt chocolate at a time.

They have plenty of left of centre policies - thoroughly comprehensive equalities law, cautious but nevertheless worthwhile land reform bill, broad support for social democracy and the welfare state, redistribution of tax revenues to cancel out the Tory policies designed to hit the most vulnerable (eg. bedroom tax), support for renewables, opposition to nuclear weapons etc. You can't say that every leftist policy they adopt is populist (a millennia old aristocratic codeword for ""democratically popular"" incidentally) and therefore doesn't count against the ledger.

But yes, other than that, they have been thoroughly centrist. Cautious in every way. Too eager to build support from contradictory bases. This is exemplified by the failure to pass an assisted dying bill for example.

2. If you are implying an attack on the UK exclusively then consider the UK then we have france carrying their own nuclear weapons and italy, germany, belgium, turkey and the Netherlands with us nukes all of which would have been heavily threatened most likely enough to motivate them to attack as well

3. MAD is only effective if you do follow up on any threats othewise you have removed the insentive not to attack and you lose the mutualy assured part, the key is that by attacking you will do yourself a lot of damage

4. I do think we should keep the nuclear deterrent however it is not important enough, because there is the distinct possibility that we are not killed, or at least any more dead that with nukes that i am willing to over look it if the majority of everything else they i agree with

It's not my aim to provide a watertight argument - because I know it's fruitless trying to convince those who enthusiastically cheered on Tim Hunt's shaming.  Like I said elsewhere - it's a matter of cognitive dissonance.  The shamers will *always* be looking for a way out to justify their actions.  Nothing I say will shift their opinions.

But again - it's not my aim to do so.  My aim is really to let everyone else know that Hunt was falsely smeared.  And to put the facts on the table where everyone can see them.  I'm not interested in a big debate.  

And really - why should I be?  Reddit has proved to me time and again that we're incapable of level-headed debates on anything involving gender issues.  Why the hell should I put myself through the mangle and engage in one more flame war where people are going to insult me, resort to downvote tactics and generally try to bully me into submission?  

And even your comment is just more snark trying to goad me further.  Which is fine - but I'm not going to play that game.

Labour has always been a broad church, but when you have someone like Kendall claiming support for the idea of an English Labour party, which would further fragment the party, I'd argue it shows that all rushing into the leadership debate has served to do is highlight how unsure Labour is of itself right now.

Miliband shouldn't have resigned immediately, he should have held the fort until a new leader was properly announced. He could have led the party for at least a couple of months.

If you start working for them and they have to call you five times to get your bank details because payroll day is soon, that's five minutes they could have used trying to get clients to get more people in work and earn them more money. 

Basically you have to give them all that stuff in advance so they are set up to pay you immediately as soon as they get a role in that you are matched to.

All the other bits - as your employer, they have a huge responsibility to make sure that their employees are legally allowed to work in the country, otherwise they get hefty fines. It would look terrible if they had to pull someone off a job because they hadn't checked their eligibility to work and the client might even sack them.

I have only once NOT had to go into an office to register before starting a job over the last 10 years, and I have temped that whole time. The exception was based 50 plus miles from me but filling roles in my region. 

The going in bit is about fit too. Let's say they employed someone to work in a high end shop and they turned up with dozens of face piercings and a Mohawk. Wouldn't go down well, would it? Not that it should matter, but it still does. If you are wanting driving work, the chances are that they will notice if you stink of booze - you wouldn't employ an alcoholic for a driving role, nor someone who just binge drunk so much the night before the interview that they still smell of it at 10am.

Right now the bulk of the conversation is being driven by the media, petition's like these (if signed by large numbers of people) find their way into people's lives through various forms of media and that can help change the perception of what the public wants. Right now it's being led by Daily Mail and other similarly bias media outlets that wish to focus on the prominence of psychosis and how taking weed is ""scarier than being on in Gaza"".   
  
Nowadays online petitions make the news (not TV news but it is reported on). If this petition hit huge numbers that it can help change the perception some may have that people don't want this to happen. Online petitions have gone from a source of ridicule to an effective way to aggregate public opinion, which has only happened since access to the internet and the change in its demographic has occurred (and this has literally only really been the case for 2-3 years).   
  
Just check this out to see how widespread a petition can be spread through the media (even when it's done in a intentionally offensive way):

What the shamers probably didn't count on is that the public is almost completely on Tim Hunt's side.  Turns out that most normal people recognize that a 72 year old man will occasionally make a corny self-effacing joke without the world coming to an end.  And most normal people find that witch-hunting someone for a harmless joke was creepy at best.

And what the shamers really didn't count on was that [Louise Mensch was going to devote her every waking hour to expose all the distortions in the initial news-stories](http://unfashionista.com/2015/07/21/the-silence-of-the-shams-wcsj2015-falsely-reported-sir-tim-hunt/).

Speak for yourself. I have no problems with it. I've spent years working with alcohol and heroin addicts. That is addiction. It has fuck all to do with being cool either. 

&gt; If you're smoking spliffs there's all that unfiltered tobacco which no one ever mentions. 

Again, speak for yourself or buy a bong or something. Gave up cigarettes years ago, weed doesn't change that.
&gt; My housemates still smoke daily, first thing they do when they get home is wrap up. They do very little housework and have absolutely no ambition, I'm also starting to notice signs of depression in them. Probably because they never leave the house, both have social anxiety. 

I smoke daily. No issues, regular well paid employment, mortgage, kids probably coming soon. Definition of stable life. Likewise for the vast majority of people who use cannabis. What would destablise my life is being arrested and having criminal record despite never harming a soul in my life and having no criminal record, committing no other crimes and even never going above a fucking speed limit in a car. When I worked night shifts in a previous job cannabis was the only thing that would help me sleep in daylight hours wihtout making me feel hungover. 

&gt; I know this will not be the case for everyone,

Yes, it really isn't. All you've posted is stuff based on your extremely limited observations of some lazy people who would probably be shit at house keeping with or without. That doesn't actually apply to the vast majority of people who use cannabis. It isn't a problem drug. Source: work with people with actual, serious life threatening addictions. Many of my previous clients are dead and buried because they literally drank themselves to death. There are no known deaths involving cannabis (actually I'm wrong on that one, there was a guy crushed to death years ago hauling tons of the stuff in a car that crashed...)

&gt; Its fine in moderation but if its going to be legalised there needs to be measures in place for people who fall into addiction. 

Hence most models for legalisation include funding for health services to combat possibilities or to pay lip service to it, likewise with preventative education.

***

In **medical** specialities the consultant on call will generally stay until late evening, going round reviewing all the new patients coming in and putting a senior plan in place. Then they're back first thing in the morning to review those that came in after they'd gone home.

In between, they're just a phone call away for any urgent advice or to come in if needed.

On **surgical** on call shifts it's very common for the consultant to have to be present into the late evening for a big case from the afternoon intake maybe taking several hours to sort it out. If not they usually phone the registrar for an update about the patients coming in and to offer any advice.

Even more so than the medical consultants, they are on the end of the phone and ready to come in and help out with an operation if the registrar's struggling or if a complicated emergency comes in. Again, even on Saturday and Sunday, they're there first thing in the morning to do a ward round of *all* the surgical emergencies in the hospital, that came in that week as they need daily consultant review. Usually they stay for the day and help with operating and especially any big cases that need sorting out.

***

I honestly can't remember the last on call I worked where a consultant wasn't on the ground pitching in and seeing patients/operating for a fair proportion of their shift. This is on top of the thousands of hours of unpaid overtime which every doctor in the NHS will do though their career just to finish the day's work properly (which there is literally no mechanism in place to record and pay people for).

Obviously, like others have said, there are specialities where such an immediate presence isn't necessary but that's reflected in their pay.
