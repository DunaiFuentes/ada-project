Teams get new stadiums even if the attandance is really low, which seems like completely unnecessary investment.

But the new coach, Dárdai is at least realistic, honest and respected. He achieved a lot as a player of Herta Berlin and hopefully he can help the team to qualify for the Euros. It was a long time ago that happened with Hungary.

Neither approach is 'fair'.  Diversocracies involve social engineering and penalizing those who are considered to have more 'privilege', whereas competition and meritocracies suffer from the fact that some people have an inborn advantage over others - whether that's access to more resources, or the inconvenient fact that talent and intelligence is spread unequally throughout the population.

I think the point he makes about oil is an interesting one in this context. Oil prices were based on sentiment that they would always stay high and be a good route to strong returns on capital. As soon as that sentiment has been reversed we suddenly see that the bottom in the market is lot lower than even a government like Russia (who's economy is effectively based on oil exports) has expected. There was a bubble in oil prices, there is a bubble in house prices and we will see that the bottom is probably going to be a lot lower than a lot of people are expected. I'd bet on a proportional decline in house prices (upto 15 - 20%) the closer we get to 3% base interest rates.

&gt;___The Aztecs___ is the sixth [serial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) in the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts from 23 May to 13 June 1964. It was written by [John Lucarotti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lucarotti) and directed by John Crockett.

&gt;The serial sees the mysterious time traveller [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Doctor) ([William Hartnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hartnell)), his granddaughter [Susan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Foreman) ([Carole Ann Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Ann_Ford)), and teachers [Ian Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Chesterton) ([William Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Russell_(actor\))) and [Barbara Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Wright_(Doctor_Who\)) ([Jacqueline Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Hill)) arrive in [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico) during the [Aztec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec) empire. Barbara becomes mistaken for the goddess Yetaxa, and accepts the identity in hope of persuading the Aztecs to give up human sacrifice. The Doctor warns her about changing history.

2. Kids who would've otherwise went to private schools now go to state schools, where they incur a cost. Previously, their parents still paid taxes but didn't burden the state education system, now they do.

Had no idea what to do in that situation (never even had a mobile phone at that time) but I knew that there was no chance in hell that the deer was going to make it. The two lasses in my car wanted me to run it over to put it out of its misery, only I was in a Corsa Merit and didn't really fancy putting my car out of action with having bits of deer stuck in it.

And then came a couple of lorries approaching on the same side of the road as the deer about 50 metres up from around the corner. I ended up just leaving before seeing the aftermath. 

What are you supposed to even do in those situations? With all 4 of its legs being snapped back I didn't even want to get out of the car in fear that it would attempt to stand up when I approached, and even if I did get close enough to it, then what? I don't think I could bludgeon a deer to death with a socket wrench.

Do that and you end up with an oppression olympics in which everyone's incentivized to play the victim. And that's pretty much what is happening in some areas.

But then you go on to say: ""I guess I am in favor of government grants and the like to give disadvantaged people a bit of a leg up"", which isn't any different from what I just quoted, since you are essentially rewarding those from an less privileged background with scholarships or grants (""incentivized to play the victim""). 

This is certainly something I'm in favour of, yes, because you are essentially doing something to cancel out the advantage that's available only to the few whose parents can afford to provide.

&gt;Well, life isn't fair, is it? Yes, it turns out that not everyone can afford to take time out to explore poetry or develop an acting career. 

It isn't, so we should make it fairer then. Meritocracy depends on a degree of equality, sometime enforced. Again, if it is correct that ""working-class"" actors are in decline, we've only moved away from meritocratic ideals; unless of course, you intend me to believe that people who went to better and more expensive schools were definitely going to end up dominating regardless of their background.

&gt;As I said above - it's now easier than ever before in history for people to cheaply produce and market their own art. Want to be a writer/actor/comedian/singer etc?

&gt;She feels great sadness and sympathy for the ones who are just hard out of luck and can't get a job no matter their enthusiasm, and Jobcentre staff usually work much harder for people like that.

Sorry but I have a huge problem with that. The problem being that once you've been on jobseekers for a good while (i'm talking months with no luck in securing a job) your enthusiasm when you attend the jobcentre tends to be none existent. Mainly because you know each time you go in it's completely down to the discretion of the person behind the desk as to whether you can afford to pay your bills/rent/get food for the next month. You tend not to go in all smiles and giggles once you start getting called out for stupid things, or when you start getting put on courses that you absolutely know are not going to help you. Or try getting forced into a job selling solar panels for commission as was my case last November which I didn't have a say in the matter (it lasted 3 days before I got called in for a performance meeting for not hitting my targets of 3 appointments per day).

So I'm sorry, but I really think that advisers should not be judging people based on how joyful they are when they arrive at the jobcentre and instead just determine whether they have met the requirements of their JSA agreement and leave any stereotyping they may have out of their jobs.

&gt;The bad press about job centre staff being outright briefed to trick people off JSA is ""utter nonsense""

Which?  ;) Haha, I just wanted to give a wee explanation of how devolution works. Unlike the USA which is a federation of states coming together with limited federal power, the UK is the opposite way around, with the centre having all the power, and chosing to devolve some powers to some of the bits. So Scotland has quite a powerful Parliament, that's getting some more powers, Northern Ireland has a legislative Assembly which has quite far ranging powers, although has come to a standstill on more than one occasion and been shut down by Westminster, Wales has an Assembly that's recently been given some more powers, but still behind NI imho, and then there's London with an Assembly too. Some regions of England were offered devolution but said no. 

You'll notice there's a bit of a mismatch there though, since you're missing England in that list.

null,false,ahoneybadger3,null,null,null,"&gt;It's certainly true there exists a sizeable group of people whose desire is to live on state benefits and not work.

The problem is that due to these few people, everybody on JSA is getting lumped into that category, you're met with scrutiny depending on who your JSA advisor is.

I was on daily signing for 3 months leading up to two weeks before Christmas. My advisor at that time was a wonderful lady, she secured me a couple of interviews at the local hospital which I was unfortunately unsuccessful at getting (they had a scheme with each other where once per year they'd take on 10 people on JSA into full time work for 3 months as a trial/learning experience). I never had a problem with that advisor and I attended every appointment given to me with hordes of evidence to back up what jobs I had applied for and details of follow up calls I had made. I couldn't fault that woman, she even sent me out shopping for a new suit with some funding she had secured due to my weight loss in the past year and my present interview clothes just not fitting me any more.

But there's advisers out there that do try to catch you out for really pointless stuff. One tried to sanction me because I didn't have a personal statement on one of my CVs on the direct gov website. 

Another on the work program kept changing my address on her system so my post went elsewhere (at one point my post started getting sent to my neighbour) and each time that happened, she would send through a sanction request due to me missing an appointment I never knew I had, and in those cases you're immediately declared as being at fault regardless of the evidence you had. Trying to overturn those decisions isn't easy, you're looking at well over a month to do so.

What happens when you declare that people must work for their benefits is that hordes of people get sent on courses and 'work experience' that do not benefit the claimant and in no way, shape or form help them back into work.. In fact the majority of the time they hinder it... Once a new course pops up on the jobcentre systems, the advisers are told that they have to fill so many slots in that particular morning, it no longer becomes a case of sending people to them where they'll benefit, but it just becomes filling quotas regardless. That's not a system that could ever work and it's wasting resources and funding in doing so.

It also doesn't show the problem of health costs. An average 70 year old costs the NHS 6x as much as a 40 year old. An average 80 year old costs the NHS 10x as much as a 40 year old. This works out that about 40% of all NHS spending is on the over 65s.

NHS spending will need to increase by about 30% by 2050, to cope with the ageing population. Pensions will need to increase by about 20% by 2050.

This combined with having seen it with my own eyes leads me to wonder where you get this idea that no one cycle on the road from. Maybe things have changed from last time I was in Japan. It was a year ago now. Odd though as some cities I visited actually even had UK style bike lanes painted on the roads. Does nobody use them any more ? As I saw people doing so when I was there.

&gt; It's still essentially nationalism which is equally morally reprehensible in my opinion.

Sigh...  Nationalism isn't necessarily a bad thing. Gandhi for instance was a nationalist yet no one accuses his politics as being morally reprehensible. What Plaid Cymru (and the SNP) have is known as [civic nationalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_nationalism) meaning that it is not racist or xenophobic towards other people, just that they believe in self-determination for their own nation. 

What the BNP have is known as [ethnic nationalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_nationalism) which is in contrast to civic nationalism. Until 2009 the BNP only accepted membership from people of a select few ethnic groups, [until they were obliged by law to accept ethnic minorities](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/5611876/BNP-ordered-to-accept-ethnic-minority-members-or-face-prosecution.html). Therefore, claiming that Plaid and the BNP are morally equal is completely false.   

Besides, why are you singling Plaid out? The SNP are nationalists and the Greens also are to an extent.

Her mother wasn't pulling out the tubes, no one said she was pulling out tubes, the only reason that the fear the daughter would be harmed came up is because the nurses were worried the mother would take the daughter home - there is no suggestion anywhere by anyone that she tried to do anything that would harm her daughter, this idea only comes up because the defence team say that the PC was afraid that might happen.

However, you've made some assumptions on what my opposition to this move in the Lords would be (not that I mentioned whether I support the measures or not).

The quote on the other trending article, from Nicholas Lansman, ISPA Secretary General, sums it up more succinctly than I can:

&gt; Inserting the clauses contained in the Draft Communications Data Bill into an already complex Bill that is itself proceeding through Parliament via a fast-tracked process is ill-judged. The Lords cannot have time to properly consider the substantial powers contained in the amendments to the Bill, and would deny the Commons the opportunity to properly consider the powers as well. The Draft Communications Data Bill was scrutinised by a Joint Parliamentary Committee in 2012 who concluded that there “should be a new round of consultation with technical experts, industry, law enforcement bodies, public authorities and civil liberties groups”. At the time industry was critical of the level of consultation and there has since been no adequate consultation since.

Others have made similiar comments, and cited other reasons such as the tremendous cost of the original bill. Clearly legislation on this issue has failed to pass before, and it seems an abuse of parliamentary procedure to add it into a bill under the circumstances above, especially when the bill has moved 3/4 through the legislative process. Either it will extend the time needed to spend on this bill for further debate or it will pass (or fail) without meriting the amount of attention which previous events indicate it should.

It is no reason to accept the status quo, and every reason to push for reform in Saudi at as fast a rate as can be achieved without destabilizing the state. A bloody revolution has the potential to undo decades of progress and to kill far more than a barbaric but stable state.

Our own country paved its path towards the relative utopia it is today with a great many ""cobblestones"" such as Oscar Wilde, Hugh Latimer, Alan Turing, Alice Molland, Thomas Cranmer, and thousands more both notable and forgotten. We had our own [Bloody Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Code) with all the horror inherent in such a system. The last of our laws against witchcraft were repealed in 1951, and the last prosecutions were during the 1940s. Homosexuality was legalized only a few decades ago - when we liberated the Nazi concentration camps, we transferred homosexual prisoners to other prisons. It took us centuries of stable development as a state to reach the point at which we are now.

We have a duty as humans to do what is reasonably possible to help Saudi Arabia emerge from barbarism more quickly than we did. With our experience and modern means of communication, diplomacy, and trade, it should be possible to achieve in decades but not weeks what took us centuries.

null,false,God_notheotherone,null,null,null,"My experience as a claimant of JSA - for a few weeks several years back - was very negative. The staff didn't really seem helpful and I ended up being sanctioned because I was applying for the jobs I wanted, not the jobs that the centre were encouraging me to apply for: tbings like sous chef, domestic assistant, telesale, etc. I ended up withdrawing my claim and living off my savings for a few more weeks while I waited for a start date. Tbough on relfection I can empathise with them and I'd personally never choose to work for the DWP. The job centre is there to administer government policy. They aren't charity workers, although i'm certain many jobcentre staff are very helpful and passionate with what they do.

Since then i've had a previous job working with tax credits. For the most part things were ok: customers only tended to be unhappy when their claim had been stopped or when they were overpaid. The vast majority of times this would be because theh had given us incorrect information. With tax credits people are often employed or have another form of benefit, and tax credits are essentially supplements to income. So if their claim is cut they usually have at least some other form of income to fall back on. And most people who claim tax credits genuinely do need the money, primarily because they are on shit wages or the company they work for can't afford to give them more hours.

That said, there were a lot of people who didn't need tax credits and were just using the additional money to buy luxuary items and for holidays, etc. And then you had tbe people who intentionally limited the amount of work they did because tax credits made up a good proportion of the lost income anyway. And people just knocking out kids and getting £15k+ for it. A lot of people treated tax credits like some guaranteed form of income, rather than what it is - a state payout that can be changed or even withdrawn at any time. So they essentially based their livelihoods on it. And why not, when they can always take out a short term loan and use tax credits to pay back the debt? It just breeds dependency. And fraud is rife, from people trying to hide their income, partners, falsifying children's details, and so on.

On the opposite side of things i've also worked in tax. With tax credits, you are predomiantly dealing with people on a low income, so everyones in the same boat really. With tax, you can deal with people from those on the minium wage or the unemployed right through to multiple millionaires. For me is was simply a daily reminder of social inequality. The fact that the poorest of people tended to be the most humble while people on huge salaries would often turn into absolute cunts because their tax bill had gone up by a few quid. 

In all, the benefit system in this country is a mess. And I wouldn't be surprised if iDS's Universal Credit is abandoned following the election.

null,false,digidydan,null,null,null,"Eljero Elia scored twice for Southampton in win at Newcastle United... but who is the controversial character grateful for a fresh start in the Premier League?  

•	Eljero Elia is on loan at Southampton from German side Werder Bremen 

•	Elia has a controversial past and is seeking a fresh start in Premier League

•	He started at Den Haag before moving to Twente and then Hamburg

•	But after falling out with the club following injury he joined Juventus

•	Holland international failed to make an impression on Serie A

•	Elia joined Werder Bremen after one season but didn't match expectations

•	Social media spats led to him being ushered out of the club on loan 

They were two moments that clearly meant a great deal. After Eljero Elia fired Southampton into a 14th-minute lead at Newcastle United on Saturday night, be made a beeline for Ronald Koeman and gave his new boss a warm embrace.
And after scoring the deflected goal that earned the Saints all three points at St James' Park, he leaped joyously into the air, spun and did that Cristiano Ronaldo thing of flexing his muscles.
This was the measure of a man grateful for another opportunity to prove his talents, grateful for a change of scenery, a fresh challenge and a little bit of faith shown in his undoubted abilities.


Elia, a 27-year-old Dutch winger, certainly comes with a bit of a chequered past and a bad-boy reputation. Werder Bremen, the Bundesliga club who loaned him to Southampton this month, were glad to see the back of him.
But his double at Newcastle, which returned Southampton to third place in the Premier League, suggests that all this trouble could be behind him.
Elia was certainly very humble in his post-match interview: 'I want to thank first my team-mates and trainer and chairman. They have trusted me, they gave me the chance to play for Southampton.
'The feeling for the first goal was like a dream come true. The second was like i don't feel nothing in my body. I was so happy.'
When asked why he ran straight for Koeman after his firm, low first-half strike found its way under the body of goalkeeper Tim Krul, he replied: 'I wanted to thank him that he gave me the chance to play for Southampton.
'He was the only one that believed in me. The players have helped me from the first moment. The captain (Jose Fonte) speaks a lot with me. I'm so happy.'
Elia certainly looked chuffed and a new chapter in his life and career has been started.
His story began at local side ADO Den Haag, whom he joined as a nine-year-old and made his professional debut for in 2004 at the age of 17.

Quickly establishing himself in the first team, Elia scored six times in 59 appearances for them before friction between himself and new coach Lex Schoenmaker pushed him to the exit door.
There was talk Ajax wanted to sign him but the Amsterdam side wanted to loan him straight back to Den Haag, by then a second division side, and back into conflict with Schoenmaker.
He joined Twente instead and found some of his best from under Steve McClaren, scoring 15 times in 73 outings for the club in his two seasons there.
While at Twente, Elia was given his first taste of Champions League and Europa League football and became a fixture in the Holland Under 21 team.
Named the Dutch Football Talent of the Year in 2009, there were again suggestions Ajax and PSV Eindhoven were interested in signing him but his next move would take him over the border to Germany.
Again, it wasn't without controversy. Amid all the speculation of a move to one of Holland's big clubs, Elia signed a two-year contract extension at Twente. Two months later, he announced he wanted to leave at the end of the season.


Hamburg paid Twente £6.5m for his services but very little went to plan. He suffered an ankle injury in late November of his first season and missed the rest of the campaign.
In March, a poorly-applied tattoo went septic and the discomfort was so severe, Elia was unable to wear his playing and training kit.
His second season at Hamburg saw Elia becoming increasingly allergic to the club - he moaned that the playing style didn't suit him, he was rotated in and out of the team and he claimed Hamburg didn't look after him while he was recuperating from surgery on his injured ankle.
It came as little surprise, then, to see Elia sold off to Italian giants Juventus in a £7m deal in August 2011. Despite being a Holland international, he played infrequently and though he collected a Serie A winners' medal he contributed little towards it.

Inevitably, the restless Elia grew impatient and left Turin for Werder Bremen in an attempt to again revitalise his career. The Bundesliga side, great rivals of his former club Hamburg, paid £4.5m and offered a £2m salary.
He was billed as the man to fire Bremen back into European competition. In reality, they spent two and a half years battling relegation while Elia kept putting his foot in it.
In April 2013, Elia and team-mate Marko Arnautovic, now at Stoke, were caught speeding at 3am. It was later alleged that the two players had acted aggressively when stopped and insulted a police officer.
Their punishment was to spend the rest of the season training in isolation but while Arnautovic moved to Stoke, Elia decided to stay.
After failing to find the net during his first season in Bremen, there was an improvement last season, with four goals in 33 appearances.
But Elia was still proving a nuisance off the field. Before the Nordderby against former club Hamburg, he tweeeted the words 'Ready for War', a sentiment that unsurprisingly doesn't go down too well in Germany.
He later insulted a Bremen fan on Facebook, telling them to 'go f*** youself.'
By that time, Bremen were sick of the sight of him and looking to farm him out on loan. Southampton were willing to take the gamble, with the option of signing him permanently at the end of the season.
Right now, that is looking like a distinct possibility as Elia strives to put a turbulent past behind him.

&gt;

&gt;In the *[Dungeons &amp; Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons)* (*D&amp;D*) [fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy) [role-playing game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game), __alignment__ is a categorization of the [ethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics) (Law/Chaos axis) and [moral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality) (Good/Evil axis) perspective of people, creatures, and societies.

&gt;The earliest edition of *D&amp;D* allowed players to choose among three alignments when creating a [character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_character): Lawful, implying honor and respect for society's rules; Chaotic, implying rebelliousness and individualism; and Neutral, being the middle ground between the two extremes. The *[D&amp;D Basic Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set)* retained the system of three alignments, keeping it through the *[D&amp;D Rules Cyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Rules_Cyclopedia)*.

&gt;*[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons#Advanced_Dungeons_.26_Dragons)* (*AD&amp;D*) introduced a second axis of Good, implying altruism and respect for life; Evil, implying the absence of altruism and no respect for life; and Neutral, the middle ground between the two extremes.

Shift workers

22.—(1) Subject to regulation 24—

(a)regulation 10(1) does not apply in relation to a shift worker when he changes shift and cannot take a daily rest period between the end of one shift and the start of the next one;

(b)paragraphs (1) and (2) of regulation 11 do not apply in relation to a shift worker when he changes shift and cannot take a weekly rest period between the end of one shift and the start of the next one; and

(c)neither regulation 10(1) nor paragraphs (1) and (2) of regulation 11 apply to workers engaged in activities involving periods of work split up over the day, as may be the case for cleaning staff.

(2) For the purposes of this regulation—

“shift worker” means any worker whose work schedule is part of shift work; and
“shift work” means any method of organizing work in shifts whereby workers succeed each other at the same workstations according to a certain pattern, including a rotating pattern, and which may be continuous or discontinuous, entailing the need for workers to work at different times over a given period of days or weeks.

It's the excuse to push back all the hard-fought gains of the working class, and take us back to the days of the workhouse. The only possible result will be suffering for the most vulnerable people in society.

Steelies are much harder and they're much heavier so the force of the kick becomes much greater.

The fact we do not know more about the circumstances of him kicking her is down to the article more than anything else. As for the testimony of the others, the security people were unable to remove her which would suggest a greater level of force will end up being used (they are not normally shy about using force themselves) and as for the other officers, I can't, from that article, see anything particularly damming.

Only other UK club I know they have is Queen's Park in scotland....not sure who else worldwide but I'm sure wikipedia has it.

Nike  -&gt;  I've got Celtic shirts from the last 5 years and each year they've gotten smoother and lighter......but way less durable and rugged. If I even think really hard about velcro they start to snag.  

Adidas -&gt; The fan-quality shirts are pretty shit. Get a-hold of the player issue adidas stuff though (i've got a Denmark one in Formotion, and a Scotland in Techfit.....) and it's like night and day.  
It's also over double the $$ unfortunately....and rare....most teams don't even let the player issue stuff hit the market.  But if you actually want to play in a jersey and not have it disintegrate....these are the ones.

Umbro  -&gt;  Not always the best styles....but every shirt I've got from their ""tailored by umbro"" series (england, ny cosmos, nottingham forest, canada) are just a cut above everyone else fabric-wise.  Feel about as quality as the player-issue adidas.....not sure how they are since nike took all their contracts and cut them loose though.

Puma -&gt; the skin-tight tops with baggy basketball shorts just looks weird.  The african national teams seem to be able to pull it off.....but throw it on a bunch of less chiseled guys and it's not so good.  

Warrior/New Balance -&gt; Designs for liverpool were odd to say the least....but they got people talking...and they didn't fuck with the home shirt.  Maybe with Warrior branding getting folded back in under the New Balance name they'll stop with the crazy designs that seem to go with the Warrior style (all sports....look at their hockey gear).... The rumour is that New Balance is taking over the Celtic contract next year and I'm pretty excited for that.

I'm not saying that this sort of thing is an every day use of force nor that it is acceptable in every altercation. Most altercations can be ended with simple grappling tactics if you know what you're doing. However police are trained for grappling and striking when it becomes necessary.

I ended up also running into her during a visit to a church I lived near.

When she moved away mid-year she left me a note saying how much she appreciated my being there as a friend and thanks for going to church with her etc. I'm still really glad I was able to be her mildly reluctant friend, but also guiltily relieved that she moved away so I didn't need to be friends with her long-term.

Perhaps try working on the flow of your sentences, paragraphs etc.. This read closer to a book report than an article on the development of a footballer. 

&gt;What he does do is keep it simple. Fans tend to overlook this and assume he's having a bad or ineffective game but every team needs a player who quietly goes about his business. There's no fuss or amateur dramatics. He's there to do a job and he does it brilliantly. Pochettino rates him and he should be applauded for introducing him into the team, much like Sherwood should with Bentaleb last season. 

I know you're not asking for a critique when you've posted this guys, but honestly it needs a bit of love to keep me engaged. Maybe I am just a horrible reader. 

&gt;*What Ryan Mason does do is keep it simple. His performances appear to leave much to be desired, but when when brought under closer inspection his subtle role in the middle of the park allows the rest of our squad the freedom to fulfill their duties. Mason has lived up to the billing under Pochettino and if he progresses within the first-team ranks much like Bentaleb last year under Sherwood, Spurs will be gifted another talented academy project.*

On second though, it may sound worse now. Thought I'd give it a go. 

Regardless, Mason is a beaut academy prospect for us and he can continue his development, while staying injury free, we're looking quite interesting.

In Victory of the Daleks, Eleven notes that Amy should remember the Daleks moving Earth, and it is later explained that the reason she doesn't remember it is that the responsible Daleks were swallowed by the Cracks, erased from all spacetime, and therefore none of it ever happened.

Same happened to the giant cyber robot in Victorian London, he says outright.

So basically everything glaringly canon-breaking that happened between The Doctor's birth and the S5 finale can be retconned with that, really.

Even stuff in the future if necessary...


My *second* theory is that Captain Jack spent some time in a parallel universe. If Mickey the idiot can do it, I'm sure Jack can. Apart from the walls being technically closed most of the time, there's not much stopping him. So yeah. The world-altering parts were in another reality with no bearing on us, and he later (maybe) comes back.

The most likely time for that to have happened is when he hitchhiked away at the end of Children of Earth - he could have ended up anywhere.

And those 10 sets of kits were designed by 10 different people. So 40 sets of kits for their top clubs, and hundreds of sets of kits for the rest. And those are just football kits. 

Usually a designer will work on multiple kits but focus on the most important club's first. That and the fact that the standard kit options need to be simple to fit as many clubs as possible leads to pretty simple options.

I think Nike has custom designs for more than their 3-4 top clubs - that was just a very lowball estimate. It's probably more like 15 clubs. So you can see how crazy it can get.

Hey man, here's a post I was gonna submit on your thread, but given the harshness of the DWP's/Civil Service electronic media/chatting about anything whatsoever anywhere outside our buildings I'd rather you posted it, if you wanna. It's your call. Please don't even use the name of my throwaway if that's ok, heck, I just don't want this linked to me, my IP, or anything whatsoever. I'm pretty sure they don't read reddit messages, ha.

I've worked within the DWP for a bit. The people are fine and moderately happy in their jobs, I suppose. There are nice people, decent people and mega bastards, just like everywhere else. Probably 25% nice, 70% fine, 5% bastards.
My role means I don't have any decision making powers, so I generally try to take very little home with me, emotionally, though of course when you're dealing with people that is impossible. It can be hard to muster the energy to be empathetic towards somebody who's got a broken arm when I've just talked with someone who has a child with 3 months to live for 45 minutes but I try my best. I have to try to make the whole benefits process as smooth as possible (a difficult task) and try to prevent/fix the variety of ways a benefit claim can be mucked up by everyone involved in the process.  

I can only speak for my role, but I have had no pressure whatsoever to trick or mislead or badly advise customers in any way whatsoever to lead to them getting sanctioned. We drones in my particular role are trained to assume all customers are genuine and to report what they tell us as the truth, fraud can figure it out if not.
It's been repeated to us on innumerable occasions that 99.9999% (or whatever it is) of claims are genuine, and that we should treat our customers as individuals and give them the best level of service possible, given that they're coming to us in what is often their lowest point in life.  

It is hard when I read a lot of the stories. Especially the ones which are ""I have a disability, look, a doctor's note, and they've said I'm fit for work"". Firstly, obviously, fitness for work depends on everyone's individual capacities and their own feeling about their fitness for work.  

But on the other hand, there are plenty of people with very serious physical and mental disabilities/conditions who with the right adjustments can lead fulfilling and productive working lives, and so just because you're missing a leg or an arm or two doesn't mean you should be forever labelled as unfit for work, or that that's assumed to be the case by the government. It would be deeply discriminatory if that was the case. That said, clearly there is a balance to be struck and we aren't there yet, especially regarding mental health.  

The second thing which grinds my gears are the constant stories about admin fuck ups or wrong decisions. I get that it's awful for the people involved who don't get their money. But at the same time the DWP is a colossal institution. There is more paper(/electronic) work/personal info flying about than you could ever imagine. If you want more checking and double checking, that's more bureaucracy, more staff, and ultimately more money. Nobody want to pay for that, thus, mistakes are made. It's all very well saying ""well, private industry does it X more efficiently"" but they don't require an audit trail that stretches back to Genghis Khan. When the NHS chops the wrong leg off a person, it's semi-understood by the public that in a massive organisation, these things happen, and people will be hurt. This understanding doesn't extend to the DWP. Moreover, the public never hears the success stories, because nobody goes and tells their friend that they had a good experience with the DWP. As such it can be grinding to be within it, see all the legitimate and good work that goes on, and to only hear about the bad.

Still, I can only tell you about my experiences. There may well be JCP staff and managers who are nefarious jobsworths thinking they're the personal guardians of the public purse. I can say that going on our guidance that those staff are doing their jobs wrong, and they're giving the rest of us a horrid name. There is no mention of sanction targets whatsoever in DWP guidance, therefore anyone who'd even consider it is going very off piste. Furthermore, they're pissing their colleagues off no end because when they sanction people without good reason it causes no end of problems. This is a view I've heard expressed throughout the management structure. Anyway, I hope I've given some insight.

And that's how you know the answer to OP's question is ""it's basically all staged"".

When you've got 40 people on site (plus a similar number back in the UK production office), nearly two dozen vehicles, and and many millions of pounds invested, you really don't leave anything to chance. Nothing at all. The whole show is carefully, meticulously planned.

As an example, take the assorted vehicle breakdowns and ""any man left behind"" attitude. You'd never really leave someone in an inhospitable and potentially fatal situation unless you know with 100% certainty they'd be able to get out. Do you really think Jeremy Clarkson was carrying a full electrical repair set and welding kit in the back of his Porsche just in case the shock absorber sheared off and sliced through the wiring loom? Of course not -- when he was ""abandoned"" to make that repair, he was abandoned with a couple of support vehicles full of equipment and highly-trained mechanics.

And so on and so on. It's an entertainment show based around cars, not a motoring show, and like all high-budget TV entertainment pretty much every minute of what gets shown is rehearsed and expected. That's why what happened in Argentina was so shocking to them -- for once something truly unplanned occurred and they basically just stopped the show and ran.",null,0,null,1422085256,null,0,false,0,cnz6pv3,null,t3_2tgk74,null,t1_cnz6pv3,null,t1_cnyv0vx,null,null,null,1424423273,null,9,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,9,null

null,false,apeliott,null,null,null,"I posted this a while back but it sums up my experience;

""I used to work in the Department for Work and Pensions many years ago and remember doing my training in a real old-school office. Most of the staff could still remember the days back before they had computers and everyone used to smoke at their desks. As such, they were really obsessed with getting every benefit claim right down to the last penny. No exceptions.

I remember spending six hours calculating the correct payment on a really complicated case once. I left it on my supervisor's desk and went home. Glad to see the back of it. The next day I com in and the case is back on my desk with a little note. ""2p out. Do it again.""

A few years later the Labour government closed down all the local offices and started to shunt us off to huge benefit processing centers that were little more than call centers. That is when I saw the big culture change.

People were hired 'off the street' and given a tiny fraction of the training we had. Mistakes were abundant. I transferred over about a year after it had opened and was amazed at how many over or underpayments I came across. But nobody seemed to care. I used to get shouted at for being a few pennies over or under but here I saw many cases that were out by thousands.

I worked on one case that was difficult and I thought my calculations might have been a bit out so I went and found my old supervisor to ask for advice, the one that had left that note all those years back. He looked at me and said ""Just pay it. Pay them a little extra if you think you are out so they don't complain. Nobody cares here any more. They only care about how many cases you process. It's all about the stats. They can't let this place be seen to fail. It's all political.""

And that was that.

In such a short time I saw the culture going from one where accuracy was the main priority to one where stats and volume were the main concern.

In the old system we would look at benefit claims and respond to letters in the order they came in. Nobody skipped the queue unless it was an emergency.

But in the new system we quickly learned to keep all the easy claims and letters to one side until the end of the month so we could pull them out and quickly process them to buff up our numbers. I had a new supervisor who encouraged this. Unlike my old supervisor she had transferred from some Internet call center and didn't have a clue how to do my job, she was just there to hand out memos, collect stats and arrange holiday leave.

I stuck it out for maybe another six months after six years on the job. I had stopped taking any pride in my work and could see the same attitude in all the older people.

So one day I walked in Monday morning and just quit. I jumped on a plane flew to another country and didn't go back.

Best thing I ever did.

Secondly, you need to bear in mind that as Aberdeen and Stirling are in Scotland, their education system is going to be a bit different to England and Wales. Primary may not be as stark a difference as secondary, but it's worth checking out before you make a decision. 

Third, Swansea's in Wales, and the qualifications are the same as in England, but I'm not sure how widespread Welsh language teaching is in the schools in the Swansea area (that is, teaching via the Welsh language, not teaching of the Welsh language).

null,false,buried_treasure,null,null,null,"The Newbury bypass is probably the classic example, although it post-dates HHGTTG.

Newbury is a medium-sized town in Berkshire to the west of London. It also sits on the junction of two major roads -- the A4, which is a 3,000-year-old route from London to the west of England, and the A34, which is one of the main north-south routes through England. Both roads carry a large amount of traffic and they meet at a crossroads literally at the centre of Newbury.

By the mid-1990s the M4 motorway a few miles north was carrying a lot of the freight traffic that used to use the A4, but the A34 was still bringing in hundreds of large lorries right through the town centre every day. The government proposed to build a 9-mile bypass which would take the A34 traffic around Newbury and get all the lorries out of the city centre -- making the route quicker for traffic and Newbury less polluted and clogged-up with traffic.

It sounds like a win-win situation, but the problem was that the proposed route through the surrounding countryside meant building a road straight through several areas of both great natural scenery, and protected wildlife zones. In particular it went through a large area of ancient woodland (which is a legally-defined term in England). This was happening just as ecological/green issues were becoming much higher up in the public consciousness, and also at the tail end of the Major government when the Conservatives were deeply unpopular and anti-authoritarian/anti-government protests were commonplace (such as against the poll tax, against the anti-rave laws, against anti-traveller laws and so on).

As a result literally thousands of people (nearly all of them not from Newbury) descended upon the area and basically set up camp in the forests and fields of the proposed route. It was essentially the same tactic that Arthur Dent used to stop the bulldozer knocking down his house, except on a massive scale.

After many months and years of legal battles, huge numbers of police and private security contractors were brought in to try to clear the protesters away. This operation in itself took several weeks,  but eventually the road-building began.

null,false,UnfinishedOpu,null,null,null,"TL;DR You can set up a system to minimize international call expenses, but you will need the internet. 

I live in rural Wales. Been here for fifteen years. Get no mobile signal at my house and have a shit broadband connection speed. Here's what I do: For landline and broadband I use EE and my plan allows for free North American calls. Look for a provider who offers that option. 

For incoming calls I set up a Skype number with an area code in my home state, as that's where my son and most of my friends live, so those calls for them are free. Other family members in the US have cel packages that allow free in-country calls, so they call the skype number for free as well. I pay a small annual fee for the US skype number. I think it's about £40 a year. I then set my incoming skype calls to forward to my UK landline, and there's a small fee per minute for each of the incoming calls forwarded from Skype. How much you pay depends on how many calls you get! and how long you talk. I would say my annual spend on the forwarding service is no more than £60 a year, and I talk every week to my US friends and my son, in calls lasting over an hour each. I keep a balance with skype and have it set to top up automatically when it falls below £2. 

I'm not sure why you don't want to use the internet to facilitate your calls. The quality of the skype connection varies according to the speed of your connection. In London you won't have to worry about this. In rural Wales with a shit connection, sometimes there's a bit of lag on an incoming skype call. When that happens I hang up and ring the caller back. And you don't have to be logged in to skype in order for the call forwarding service to work. Once you're set up you can make and receive US calls without thinking about it. 

For the final piece of the puzzle, keeping your current US number, you might check with your carrier and see if you can set up call forwarding, then set forwarding to a US skype number, then forward skype to a landline or mobile.

I can't really determine if there is anyone that is far and away the best play for Liverpool this season but if I had to choose, I'd say Jordan Henderson if only for his strong steady presence from week to week no matter how good or bad we are performing as a team.

Starting to impress? Well, I'd have to say that some of the youngsters that we already know are good (i.e. Coutinho and Sterling) are impressive in the sense that they seem to have taken the next step in their progression as footballers and as potential stars in the Premier League.

Some have mentioned Lallana as 'starting to impress' and I'm not entirely sure I agree with that mostly because I rated Lallana very highly and I feel as if he is simply doing what was expected of him. I think his preseason injury - as well as his current injury - has derailed this season for him. But a fully fit Lallana? I think he would easily be penciled into the side from week to week.

All in all, in spite of how the season has gone and how far we seem to be from a Champions League spot, it is certainly encouraging to know that we probably won't need to make very many incoming transfers in January or in the summer. Hopefully we can simply focus on one big name player or two in the next couple windows and then I think we should have a very promising campaign next season.

Hell, we should have a very promising rest of the season as well.

A bit harsh, isn't it?

Basically she is saying to your girlfriend, 'I don't know /u/Helpopotamus but I perceive him to be an unfair flatmate, therefore, you should break up with him 'cause you had a bit of an argument over Christmas.'

Ridiculous. And there's really no need to waste time attempting to speculate why she would do something like that.

Either way, since you've posted this, I assume you want unsolicited advice, right? Of course you do. ;)

In situations like these, the easiest thing to do - incoming cliche - is to simply communicate openly and clearly with your girlfriend - and the flatmate as well - in the most level-headed way possible (I'm not advocating some big bust up or finger-pointing!). Communication is key.

He's not the worst Aussie guest, but there are a myriad of great Australian comics who could appear. That being said, Hillsy was disappointing early this series. I liked Claudia O'Doherty last week though.

null,false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,null,"I think the 30-year-old Glen Johnson is at a very interesting point in his life and his career and the next decision he makes is quite a big one.

If I were Johnson's agent or if I were the club, I'd ask him: What do really you want?

* Do you want financial security (i.e. more money)? Doubtful that LFC would offer him that.
* Do you want playing time? Doubtful that LFC would offer that.
* Do you want financial security and/or playing time enough to uproot your family or leave your family for, say, a so-called 'smaller' club in England or, say, Italy?
* Or, do you accept that you are entering the sunset of your career and could finish your career at Liverpool FC as a veteran leader to help the youngsters and still be part of something amazing in the next few seasons?

I think the hardest thing for any professional athlete to fully understand or accept is that simply due to the unyielding nature of *time* that their career may be coming to a close. (I can only imagine the amount of thinking that Gerrard had to do...)

I couldn't blame Johnson for going for more money because this is probably the last contract he gets in his career. I don't know what his finances are. What his post-football ambitions are.

I couldn't blame Johnson for simply wanting to *play* football. After all, isn't it what he loves?

However, I would love for Johnson to stay at LFC as a veteran leader and someone who could also be more than effective when called upon.

When Steven Gerrard leaves Liverpool, one could argue that he may not necessarily be missed on the pitch for a variety of reasons. However, I can confidently state that his value in the last season or so has been his presence, his leadership, his aura, his words, his loyalty, his leadership, etc.

And in cases like this, I think *age* has a lot to do with it. The 34-year-old Steven Gerrard still prowls the pitch and the training grounds as a well-respected lion. And when the impulses of youth start to lead a young player down a path that leads them unfocused in life, their profession or their task on the pitch, a certain look from Gerrard can quiet their bubbling emotions or comfort a bruised ego.

Our squad is shockingly young. And when Gerrard leaves, who will remain as that old veteran leader?

I think only Johnson, Lucas and Skrtel remain as players who have spent longer than, say, 4 seasons at Liverpool. Everyone else is too young or too new. (Lucas joined LFC in the summer of '07, Skrtel in January '08, Johnson in summer '09).

Perhaps I'm making too much of this 'veteran leader' thing but I personally think it's quite important for a young team like ours.

I think it would be nice if Johnson accepts a limited role as a player at Liverpool while accepting an increased role as a leader.

However, I don't think I have ever seen anyone make a reasonable argument for why it *could* happen.

I spent a few moments to actually think about it and here is what I came up with:

The only way Ross Barkley would ever go to LFC is if he possesses a superhuman level of maturity and mental toughness.

Because, to leave Everton for LFC, Barkley would have to:

* Demand a transfer.
* Explicitly demand a transfer to the other side Stanley Park.
* Which greatly diminishes Everton's ability to negotiate a high transfer fee; A fee that would be even higher for LFC had Barkley simply been on the open market.

Then after all this happens... Barkley **must** have the balls of steel to not give a fuck about the way he left Everton, have the ability to perform *beyond* expectations for LFC (because he would have to answer questions of whether all the money and dram was worth it and questions of whether Barkley would screw over LFC in the same way he did to Everton), and still be able to live life in his hometown of Liverpool and comfortably withstand the jeers, cheers, death threats, praise, etc.

If he is *that* kind of superhuman person? Well, first off, welcome to LFC.

Okay then, just to poke at a little bit of fun. Without looking at the highway code, or looking at other redditors answers, riddle me this.

Scenario:

&gt; You are travelling uphill and you are approaching a chicane built into the road as part of traffic calming measures in the area. This chicane has no signage indicating vehicle priority and it's construction requires that vehicles travelling in either direction must cross to the opposite side of the road to navigate the chicane. (For an illustration, see [here](http://i.imgur.com/xhR0vYE.png)) There is a vehicle approaching from the opposite direction and will arrive at the chicane at the same time as you.

1) *According to the highway code, who has priority to traverse the chicane in the above scenario?*

2) *Do you agree with the highway code?*

3) *Why?*

4) *What would you do in this situation?*

I said ""one of"".

There were many many reasons, but relying upon a volatile commodity for 15% of the economy was up there with the best of them.

On top of that, the Yes campaign refused to answer questions as to what they would do if there was a collapse in oil prices and how they would respond to the corresponding drop in Government revenue, preferring instead to say that it was the ""stuff of nonsense"" and that anyone talking about it was ""scaremongering"".

Utter lunacy.

&gt; Would you be in favour of ceding your country to America if you were in a recession? 

Who is talking about ceding anything to anyone?

I already have a country - it's called the United Kingdom.

&gt; Scotland has enormous resources

*sigh*

The only people relying on the ""too wee, too poor, too stupid"" straw man were the Yes campaigners who liked to build it up so that they could knock it down.

Nobody has ever said that Scotland does not possess a large amount of natural resources or that it couldn't be a successful independent country, for some questionable value of the term ""successful"".

&gt; some oil

15% of the economy is not ""some"".

&gt; Making independence contingent on endless oil

It's not endless, that's the point.

It peaked 15 years ago and there were no answers to what an independent Scotland would do if oil prices crashed, which they duly did.

The latest line seems to be that ""We wouldn't have been independent until 2016 ANYWAY!"", but the Brent futures prices for 2016 tell a sorry tale for those that wish to put their money where their mouth is.

&gt; enormous lack of self esteem as a nation

I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I don't possess a lack of self-esteem over my dual identities as both British and Scottish.

Naturally politicians will begin proposing privatizations at some point, which will increase the costs even faster, and elderly care would still be covered by the state anyway... It would solve absolutely nothing and only make us spend more of our GDP on health care (see the USA for an example)

What people miss is that healthcare costs are rapidly increasing in every developed country, it's not because of the system we use, it's a simple economic fact that health care costs WILL increase year on year. Germany, France etc will face the exact same issues.

He does the basics of the job far better than any goalkeeper I've ever seen his age.  He reminds me of Buffon, who is the best keeper I've seen in my generation.

He comes across like he's far older than he actually is, and when you consider goalkeepers generally don't come into their own until 26-30 years old, I have no doubt he'll be the best goalkeeper in the world by some margin in 4-5 years time.

&gt;No one will want an alliance with UKIP unless they have to, and I doubt that UKIP will have enough votes to win outright.

UKIP will win seats (my guess is around 8, looking at the consitutency polling), but it's impossible to say at this point whether it'd be enough to form a majority with Labour or the Tories after the election without any other minor party also providing their support. UKIP have stated they wouldn't enter into a formal coalition, but would only act on a confidence and supply basis.

The Greens will be lucky to hold on to their one seat in brighton. They won't be forming a coalition with anybody. Under FPTP their support is nowhere near enough to start winning seats.

Even after you pass your tests, there's no demand you upgrade the bike straight away. I've kept my 125cc for now, and I passed back in October.

Yeah that's a concern, the 2L versions supposedly have a lot more poke but cost about the same. The fuel efficiency is a bit worse of course - although on the 11 model it's a lot closer than on the earlier ones. Should be fairly easy to figure out with a test drive though, the garage I linked above have quite a few Passat Estates so I can hopefully test drive both.

If you are worried about your repeat prescription being available the next time you need it, I would call your pharmacy in the first instance to check what they have on record for you. If they don't have it as a repeat, then get in touch with your GP. They may want to see you just to check that everything's OK, but you shouldn't interpret that as them wanting to take you off the medication.

Yes, Suarez was talented, but he's not a reds legend. He had a few good seasons and one amazing season with us. That amazing season came after he wanted to leave for Arsenal, arguing with the club etc. Then he left for Barca.

I have nothing against Suarez, but it's not like he captaining us like Hyypia, or was here for 5 seasons as a regular, helping us win the CL, like Xabi Alonso.

And still those posts about Xabi Alonso and Sami Hyypia has nothing to do with this sub.


But majority rules, and this gets upvoted so people must like it. I guess this has a lot to do with many joining this sub last season, and a lot of fans wasn't reds before 2009. So obviously Suarez is one of the biggest stars in the eyes of many, if you weren't here before 09. And no worries. I don't hate on new fans - I was a new fan once, every one was at some point.

It was bad enough when Thatcher died, the fake Kim-Jon-Il style crying in the streets for the press was a fucking dark day for this country. Blair is 100x worse because he's a legitimate sociopath. 

That issue is irrelevant to the current Saudi king thing though. We shouldn't be fly the flag at half-mast for a country that spends billions spreading the most backwards fundamentalist interpretation of Islam in the world. What Saudi does has caused millions of deaths across the world. 

The funny thing is most deaths in Iraq were not down to us, it was extremist muslims fighting each other as well as any civilians that got in the way. If you want to know who to blame for that, look at Saudi as one of the biggest causes of extreme Islam. Who funded Al Qaeda in Iraq, which later became ISIS?

&gt;Robinson's comments are a far cry from his renowned Castlereagh speech in October 2010 when he stated: ""Who among us would think it acceptable that a state or nation would educate its young people by the criteria of race with white schools or black schools? Yet we are prepared to operate a system which separates our children almost entirely on the basis of their religion.""

However the push back on integrated schools is not wholly restricted to the protestant establishment.

&gt;The DUP rollback comes just three months after similar calls by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) provoked outrage.

&gt; CCMS wants the department to ""dispense with its statutory duty to encourage and facilitate the development of integrated education"" and ""evaluate the public appetite for integrated education as a sectoral entity, reconsider the statutory duty and look to the promotion of other initiatives"". Alliance MLA Trevor Lunn has described CCMS and the DUP as ""strange bedfellows"".

They are clearly not 'strange bedfellows' when you take into account what Christopher Hitchens had this to say on the issue:

&gt; For many years, the Protestant establishment wanted Catholics to be both segregated and suppressed. Indeed, in the days when the Ulster state was founded, it's slogan was: ""A Protestant Parliament for a Protestant People"".  Sectarianism is conveniently self-generating and can always be counted upon to evoke a reciprocal sectarianism. On the main point, the Catholic leadership was in agreement. It desired clerical dominated schools and segregated neighborhoods, the better to exert its control.  So, in the name of god, the old hatreds were drilled into new generations of schoolchildren, and are are still being drilled.

And will continue to be drilled for the foreseeable future.  This is nothing more than a power play to forward the agenda of the minority with no benefit to the majority in society.

The only substantial changes to it are now instead of everybody from HMRC and DeFRA being able to ask for your data, it will only be the police and security services.

In essence the main parts are:

1. ISPs and phone companies will be required to record data about your internet activity, including all email metadata. They are required to retain the data they hold now for business purposes for a longer period, this is about explicit surveillance activity now being required.

2. The rolling out of more ""Deep Packet Inspection"" boxes that capture all traffic including encrypted content. This part of the legislation is basically a £1.6bn budget for GCHQ to be able to see everything you're doing whenever they feel like it.

3. A ""filtering system"" to bring all this data into one place so that an authorised user can open a browser, put in your email address or phone number and have a complete history of everything you've been doing (including quite precise locations of your movements thanks to your phone), and all the content of what you've been sending/receiving in detail.

4. For none of this to require a warrant, or even the explicit permission of a senior police officer.

**CBT**

Did this with a place in Paisley [near Glasgow] called Bike It. 4 of us for the day, me, 2 younger guys, and this ""old"" ned/chav. I actually figured he was younger than me, but alchol and other abuses took their toll so he looked mid 40s.  
The initial parts of the day were great. Explanations, etc.  
Then, it came to getting on the bike. I listened and watched the explanation of how to get the bike moving, thought ""yup, looks fine enough."" Kicked into first, added throttle, let up the clutch. Stall.  
Started the engine back up and tried again. Stall.  
Repeat... I'm moving! Stall. And the bike falls over and snaps the clutch lever.

Once I was able to get moving - and didn't need to stop - I was fine. Slalom, figure 8, etc.

This set up for pretty much the rest of the day where I was nervous with the clutch, just uncertain on how to use it right. But, somehow I passed. I have a feeling it's because I went out on the road with the ned, who was terrible. And he probably distracted a lot from mistakes I was making. However, my road awareness was reasonably good due to 17 years behind the wheel.

It took me a bit to realise [as in a number of lessons] what I had done wrong to begin with, and why. I'm also not sure how the instructor didn't catch the mistake.  
Basically, I misunderstood his directions. I was trying to release the clutch slowly the entire time I was moving, rather than waiting until the bike was stable. So, I was dumping it each and every time.

**Lessons**

I started off with lessons with the same guys. Mainly because they were highly recommended and I liked their attitude.  
They'd joke with you when appropriate and politely point out mistakes. Never getting angry [as I'd hope from any instructor, really.] I acquired the nickname ""Captain Chaos"" from them, because ""While 95% of the time, your riding's great for your level, and what we expect; it's the other 5% where I'm almost chewing through my helmet!""  
I realised I'd need more frequent lessons than the one every other week I was doing, so put my riding on hold while I saved money. And then money fell on its arse.

8 months later, I finally got back to learning with them, and requested a day's refresher [well, 2 lessons] of clutch control and basic moves. I only needed 1, and was forced out on the road after accidentally proving I could do a U-turn in the width of a single car parking space.  
Very soon started towards my DAS with them and sat my theory test. Just before I was ready for my mod 1, I got a job offer for Manchester.

**Manchester -&gt; DAS**
It was almost 2 months from moving down before I was able to recommence lessons. But with the people I went with, it was a set course of training [although, not back to back days].  
Started off on a Saturday, the whole day on 125cc. We pretty much did most of the mod 1 moves, being shown any tips and tricks we'd maybe need. Then onto a road ride.  
It was actually quite gruelling, as we went to a block of streets that allowed for weird combinations of left and right turns as the instructor felt was needed, and helping us get the lifesavers sorted for the right timing. 

Sunday was a short day. Just the morning, on 500cc bikes, redoing the mod 1 stuff with bigger bikes.

I had my mod 1 on the afternoon of the Tuesday. Started on the 500cc again, as a refresher, then onto Gladius 650s.  
Almost straight off, there was problems. One of the guys taking his test that day - for the 3rd time at that point - was someone I can only describe as a fat useless bastard.  
We were to move forward in a straight line on the bikes, at very slow speed, just to get a feel how much the clutch could pull. He drifted towards me [due to looking at the instructor rather than straight on]. Without thinking, I pull the front brake to stop from hitting him, and the bike goes down. Fortunately, I took him down with me.  
He failed his mod 1 that day, and I later found out he continued to fail it at least 5 times [some people should just give up]

Ultimately, I failed my test that day too. Somehow, I screwed up the slalom [bike didn't turn when I wanted it to], got angry with myself and called a stop to the test, in case I injured myself. [I could have gotten away with a minor]

Resat the test 3 weeks later and passed - got a minor for not turning back in to the box after the swerve. He let me redo the move, because everything else had been perfect to that point.

**Mod 2**

I sat the mod 2 about a fortnight later, I think it was. [2nd October] Ended up with 4 minors. 3 of which I know for certain when they occurred.  
1 was for going 35mph. 2 others for being too cautious around buses. ""Are you planning on picking up passengers too?"" asked the examiner in my ear...  
The 4th was for missing a rear observation. No idea when.

While waiting to tell if I'd passed - although, I thought I'd failed due to a bit of sloppy cornering at one point [but was disregarded due to the level of the rest of my riding] - he grilled me about the buses. Going on about my acceleration and the bike being nimble.  
""So, do you want to send off for your new license or just have me do it?""
""... I passed?""  
""Well, anyone who rides like that around buses deserves to suffer. Yup, you've passed.""
He hands me the certificate, ""And hold on to that, you'll need it for the 3rd stage of your test.""

Why didnt he break through? It isnt through lack of talent because he oozes it. It is bad timing. Houllier rated him but when McLeish turned up, the YTS died. Lambert followed the find tradition of Scottish cunts ruining our YTS.

Westwood was signed (who has turned out to become probably my favourite Villa player of this generation... or at least, my least detested Villa player) and once he was signed, that was the end for Johnson (and Gardner).

We keep signing shit central midfielders - Sylla, KEA, Cleverley, even Sanchez (though he is actally ok) and these wastes of space prevent our talented YTS Cms getting their chance.

The only YTS who get a chance is those who can fit into Lambert's awful footballing philossophy: get face on ball, smack it up the field, be strong, be resilient, i.e. defenders.

When he let Albrighton leave on a free, I was absolutely gutted, because Albrighton bled claret and blue. But I just feel... in fact, I don't even feel anymore. Daniel fucking Johnson. Gone. What for?

Johnson lad, get your head down, work your socks off and show us all your talent. Sorry our club did its best to ruin you.",null,0,null,1422104741,null,0,false,0,cnzaijv,null,t3_2tg0b1,null,t1_cnzaijv,null,t3_2tg0b1,null,null,null,1424421502,null,5,false,avfc,t5_2s569,5,null

null,false,madjoy,null,null,null,"My boyfriend (now husband) had been a huge West Ham fan for almost 10 years.  He lives in the US and he'd never actually been to London, but one of his good friends was originally from the area and introduced him.  He was already a huge fan when he got to see West Ham play in Columbus on their last US tour.

Now where do I come in?  Very reluctantly.  I've never been interested in sports.

To humor him, I watched the Championship playoff final (Vaz Te winner, though I didn't know who Vaz Te was at the time) because he called it an extremely historic game.  It was a great game, more interesting than I expected sports could be.  It would be lovely and not embarrassing if THAT was what got me into West Ham......... but no.

No.

Instead, as he kept watching West Ham next year, back in the Prem, I would come over and be like ""Who's that guy? He's very pretty"" and boyfriend/husband would roll his eyes.  But then I'd keep sitting there.  And watching.  And cheering when Pretty Guy did something nice with the ball.  I learned that Pretty Guy was Andy Carroll (ugh, I know.  I'm sorry!)  And then suddenly he wasn't playing anymore.  ""What happened?"" I asked boyfriend/husband.  ""Oh, he got injured.""  And yet I kept watching anyway.  And at the end of the season, loan spell over, I kept reading all the transfer rumors.  First I just wanted to know if West Ham were going to keep Pretty Guy, but then I was curious about these other possible new players.  I was frustrated when Downing was signed - he seemed promising, but it was clear we needed another striker...

And that's when I realized I was completely, head-over-heels, totally obsessed, a West Ham fan.  It's only been, what, a year and a half since then? But it's stuck.  I am now happy to collude with my husband around structuring our other obligations so we almost never miss watching a game.

Things that could easily go wrong:

* Your data is worth an absolute fuck tonne. With Google's and Facebook's data mining your browsing and purchasing habits are already logged, but it's pretty easy to get out of with private browsing. Now, your ISP will have a list of every single thing you do on the internet, and without a VPN you can't get around that. That data is worth billions, and it only takes one employee who's smart enough to steal all of it (it's not big, it can fit into a small bag full of hard drives) and sell it, then suddenly you're getting targeted adverts based on that thing you didn't want anyone to know about.  Same data could be sold to insurance providers if this country fucks up even more and the NHS gets privatised: now your history on WebMD doubles your premiums. 

* Regarding ""that thing you didn't want anyone to know about"", it's really easy for your friend in the police to find out without a warrant and blackmail you, or mention your private browsing in the pub for shits and giggles. 

* Security is also a massive problem. Politicians are notoriously technologically illiterate, they don't know how to ensure that ISPs will keep your data secure and limit access to them. There *should* be laws requiring appropriate levels of network security (air gapped network, encryption where necessary etc) but for all the government cares, the database your ISP keeps of your browsing history could be accessible to everyone in their company, and have security vulnerabilities which means someone could eventually steal everything (see the Sony hack). Or on the other hand, maybe someone in HR will figure out that they can go to this website on their intranet, type ""admin"" and ""password"" then insert a line which shows their ex accessed some ISIS training manuals. Suddenly they have armed police breaking down their door because Carol has some issues letting go.

* The data coming from your IP address may not uniquely identify you. If your wireless network isn't very secure, maybe your neighbour will connect to it and browse some child porn which gets flagged up. Suddenly your being charged since your the only person in your house, and by the time the courts have found you innocent you're in debt and everybody thinks you're a pedophile so you've lost your job and house. 

There's a huge number of issues with this law other than just your right to privacy. I'd support ISPs logging browsing habits so long as the law was very, very well written and had people who actually know what they're doing consulted. Politicians are inept when it comes to laws like this, especially when they've been rushed.",null,0,null,1422105922,null,0,false,0,cnzas35,null,t3_2tgd9h,null,t1_cnzas35,null,t1_cnz977q,null,null,null,1424421378,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

We should all experiment with picking our own stories. It's surprising how an arbitrary, made-up story actually seems to fit the facts as well as the standard narrative.

That's sort of what happens already though.

Much of the fundamental research is done in universities and funded either by the public sector or by grants from big pharma.

Any promising work then gets taken forward either within industry or in spin off companies, which is where things start to get complicated. And expensive. Very expensive. Frightfully expensive.

Of all the compounds that show promise, only a small handful will actually prove to be of any clinical benefit and of those that are, only a small number again will make it through animal trials to the human trial phase.

Assuming your compound makes it through to human trials, assuming that the side-effect profile is acceptable and assuming that you can actually produce the drug at scale and to cost... what if your drug is no better or even only just as good as the current best in class that's already on the market?

All that money, all that time... gone.

&gt;__Separate but equal__ was a legal doctrine in [United States constitutional law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_constitutional_law) that justified and permitted [racial segregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States), as not being in breach of the [Fourteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) to the [United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution) which guaranteed equal protection under the law to all citizens, and other federal civil rights laws. Under the doctrine, government was allowed to require that services, facilities, public accommodations, housing, medical care, education, employment, and transportation be separated along [racial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_in_the_United_States) lines, provided that the quality of each group's public facilities was equal. The phrase was derived from a Louisiana law of 1890, although the law actually used the phrase ""equal but separate.""

Around the 50K mark for an average GP. High rates 100K+ for extremely skilled surgeons etc.
Clinical Psychologists and other upper middle class specialist jobs to around £35K again nearly half what many are getting.

&gt;Why bother bringing them in from Africa when we can recruit from the EU?

It reduces salaries by increasing supply whilst improving medical care in Africa. It also knocks on the head the silliness you hear from doctors who all feel they would land cushy jobs in the city if their pay was reduced.

&gt;Any promising work then gets taken forward either within industry or in spin off companies

Which negates most of the benefits. If we combine our European budgets for medicine we no longer need billion dollar research to be done at private pharma. There productivity for the last 2 decades has been underwhelming to say the least. There is nothing wrong with allocating grants to private research companies if that is desired but patents belong to the European Union. Capitalism only works on non-forced purchases. If a drug company discovers a drug that can give 5 years extra life to certain cancer patients it can name a ludicrous price something no other industry can do. In reality often the ludicrous price is for 5 months extra life not years. Important to patients but unjustifiable to people who have to allocate resources. Meaning the breakthrough is effectively wasted. I would rather see less breakthrough but once discovered they fall into everyone's (including the third world's hands).",null,0,null,1422107655,null,0,false,0,cnzb7gf,null,t3_2ti0jf,null,t1_cnzb7gf,null,t1_cnzb01p,null,null,null,1424421179,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

This is so weak.

If a world shock in the economic system leads to the collapse of London as a financial center leaving behind Greek style obligations requiring the end of the NHS as we know it and crumbing living standards and personal debt would you suddenly feel that you should have jumped ship. Independence is about what sort of country you want to live in over the centuries. A small part of a bigger nation or as a small nation on it's own. It's not what's in your immediate self-interest. I agree the SNP should not have ducked the oil question. The real answer is that economic specialists are no better at predicting economic outcomes 10 years ahead than weathermen are at predicting the weather 10 years ahead. Being part of the UK could easily be a disastrous financial decision for Scotland. I believe we are in for some very dark days in the near future and that being part of a smaller self-sufficient country (in the essentials - food / water / energy) is a safer decision. But mainly I would have voted Yes because of being able to bring up my family in a democratic (proportional) and progressive country in a small enough unit to adapt to times of massive uncertainty and increased need of self-sufficiency.

I don't see any harm in their being 30, 40 debates. I work in Brussels evaluating policy, and I find that in the mundane-day-to-day business of maintaining a country there is a remarkable potential for disagreement, conflicts of interest and unforeseen problems that can scale up into a national catastrophe.

 It can take literally weeks of having people in the same room to agree an even remotely workable fishing fleet regulatory framework for a small geographical area.  This is only about who runs our country and frankly I doubt most politicians are up to the challenge of the number of debates I'd like to see them do to prove their knowledge.

It is in the best interest of a complacent establishment to only have occasional bits of screentime where anyone is actually challenging them.



I understand most people would think this was farcical? That seems sad to me but I suppose I wouldn't want to decrease engagement with a bunch of political white noise. I just don't think we are even nearly at the threshold where you can distinguish which candidate knows his own policies, let alone the policies of others.

My point is that the amendment *does* need to be voted on in isolation before it can be included in the bill. How people feel about the rest of the legislation won't matter.

After a couple more steps, the final step is ""Commons consideration of Lords amendments"". Again, MPs will have the opportunity to consider this amendment in isolation, without it being a vote on the whole bill. Given how controversial these laws have been, the fact that Labour and the Lib Dems have come out against it, and the fact that there are customs against the Lords changing the nature of a bill like this at such a late stage... I would guess that we are further from this happening than other people have suggested.

null,false,TriclinicCrystal,null,null,null,"Any kind of advice massively depends on where you live in the UK due to its significant economic north/south divide. I will just assume you live in the south-east as the majority of jobs and population are here.

Estimating from your net salary you make £19,000 which really isn't too much but at least your expenses and debt seem to be acceptable **except** for that car loan. If I assume an APR of 4.9% with a monthly payment of ~£325 I come to the conclusion that you have a £13,000 car loan. Is this big of a car loan really necessary?

To give you some perspective, my dual income household has zero debt (except our motgage) and our combined salary is £85,000. We recently bought a 'new' car for £5,000. A 8 year old low milage VW Golf in excellent condition. Traffic is the UK is slow, places are close together, road system is decent and there are few proper mountains or rugged terrain. A Golf class car is really all you need and new cars depreciate so quickly in value it really isn't worth it buying one.

Your ability to buy your own place depends on the amount of loan you can get and the deposit you have available. In the *best but unlikely* case you might be able to borrow close to 4x your gross salary which brings the loan value to £75,000 but I highly doubt anyone would be willing to lend you this much without 20% deposit. Have a look at the common property websites (i.e. [Zoopla](http://www.zoopla.co.uk)) if there are properties you would want for £90,000.

In summary, start saving now as it is extremely unlikely you will be approved for anything without a decent deposit. Having a partner to buy a property with together makes it much more manageable. Also bare in mind that a mortagage *doesn't equal* rent. If you own a property you suddenly are responsible for all the repairs and servicing your landlord normally has to pay for.

Finally, if you want a more detailed credit rating sign up for the free one month trial of Experian. Just don't forget to cancel it before the month is over.

As for the buying vs renting thing - I felt the same for a while, initially the logic seems flawless, why throw away money by renting when you can be paying a mortgage and actually ganining something? The answer is this: interest will fuck you. Believe it or not, there's a trade off between the money you lose my renting and the money you lose by buying due to interest and the various other costs associated with buying a house. That trade off means that buying only becomes worthwhile once you have enough of a deposit such that you aren't borrowing massive amounts.

My advice would be to live frugally for a few years, rent cheaply and save up as much as you can.

To put it in perspective for you, I'm 22 and on about 1650 a month and my target saving each month is £600 (usually it's around the 525 mark tbh). 

My rent + bills each month comes to just over £500 -  you could spend more or less depending on where you want to live, I'd advise sharing though as living alone makes things wayyyy more expensive.

I think the amount most banks require for a deposit is 5%, but to get decent rates you should really go higher.",null,0,null,1422109745,null,0,false,0,cnzbsi8,null,t3_2tie42,null,t1_cnzbsi8,null,t3_2tie42,null,null,null,1424420907,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

Total cost of those medications - approx. £3.  A larger amount was probably saved by staffing costs needed to safely divide the boxes up - you cant just chuck unpackaged pills in the pharmacy, nor can you just cut off a strip and hand it to the patient - doing so basically invites for drug errors to be made at some point down the line.

Giving whole boxes is also more seen in direct ward dispensing.  Depending on where you were, the ability to shift you out of the ward/day unit and free up the space is also more cost-effective - helps the hospital prevent breaches/fines/gives flexibility - by allowing the bed to be cleaned sooner, staff to be freed up sooner etc....  If you were in a recovery type area - once you're out, they can start prepping and focussing on the next case.

If there was a way to safely and quickly give you exactly what you needed, then I'd be all for it - but it might be a case of chuck a penny to save a pound.

You could increase the diameter of the tub but that leaves you in the tricky situation whereby the volume increases with the square of the radius, so without increasing the diameter much you end up with a stubby tub (of the same volume) that isn’t very high and so *appears* to have much less volume.

You could make a pretty decent arguement that Lloris is the best in the world. Manuel Neuer gets that credit by most pundits, players and fans but for me Lloris is his equal or pretty close. Here is my reasoning: Neuer has Bayern Munich in front of him. They play really good posession football and don't give much away when they are really flowing so Neuer just doesn't get put under pressure as much as Lloris. Lloris has a young team and a new manager with a new system and things go wrong more often than not. Lloris gets called into action much more often than Neuer and almost always comes away looking like a badass keeper that he is.

null,false,DanniiTheFannii,,The Guy In The Sidebar (Year 12 - Mod),null,"&gt; I know it might seem like a long way to go for some but I think otherwise.

I started revising for my A levels in summer; before I even knew if I got the grades to do the courses that I wanted. Getting ahead of things is the best thing anyone could possibly do. I speak from experience. 

I understand how everything seems scary right now, that's understandable because I feel the same way about my exams. Honestly? That feeling won't go, so you may as well make friends with it. That being said, I use fear as my motivator. The one thing in life that I'm afraid of is not being the best. Hell, I know that I deserve all the success in the world, because I'm capable of just that, but if I don't work for it, then how else am I going to get it? So I use fear to motivate me, because I'm scared of failure. It works well for me, others not so much. 

For me, what works the best is knowing that I have a schedule planned. For example, I've just done 2 hours of biology (it should only have been one, but I sort of overran a tad..) I know that I have ~1 hour for a break, where I'm just going to chill, watch some Netflix maybe, play some guitar. Whatever. Then I know that I'll go on to revise some chemistry, and physics after that until dinner and then I'm going to work on my English coursework after fitting in another hour or two of science revision. Sticking to this means that you know what you're going to do, and how long you'll be doing it for. Personally, revision is **so** much easier with a timetable; there's no excuse for you not to know what you're going to do, and hence, you're less likely to procrastinate. 

The gym definitely does keep you well motivated and focused, but it can also make you quite tired, so be wary of when you're exercising. I've recently left the gym because getting down there was too troublesome and just completely out of the way. You certainly need a *get away* from things. 

Drinking and eating. Sounds simple, but make sure that you keep yourself hydrated and fed, as it were. I'm sat here with a full English breakfast, and it's fucking great. ;)

**DAS**, lessons were ok, my instructor was great. Couple of silly mistakes early on, but he explained exactly where I'd messed up and why.

Without realising (and for the first time) I'd put the steering lock on. Had to stop mid turn, work out how to take steering lock off, then do my checks and carry on. Thought id failed on the very first part. On my emergency stop I stalled too. But when we got back inside he'd said no minors !

**Mod 2**, failed it twice. Both times were lifesavers. Once left too early coming off a busy island (1 minors, 1 major) , the second time right as I was trying to change lanes (2 minors, 1 major).

Tiendalli and Gomis are still shit and while I still think we can have a good season ahead of us and Monk should be trusted in the transfer market, he's had a bad week. Bad tactics against Chelsea, bad tactics and subs today. Shouldn't have taken Carroll off after the red, it should've been Shelvey, Dyer should've come off rather than Barrow, and instead of subbing Gomis for Oliviera he should've tried to see out the game by bringing on another midfielder or a defender, if we had one on the bench.

Barrow is a beast, he's only young but wow can he put on a performance.

I wasn't too impressed by our performance today, bit sloppy with passing and defending was a bit scrappy. And we were almost as quiet as the Blackburn fans which was pretty depressing and everytime someone tried to start a chant going only one or two would join in and it would soon die.

I did A Christmas Carol, A View From The Bridge &amp; Of Mice and Men for my English exam last year. Taking A View From The Bridge, for example:

One of the questions was something like *explain the importance of the bridge in the play.* It sounds fucking ridiculous, but I honestly could have screamed the exam hall down because I was so happy that I got that question, because it was a fucking gold mine for answers. Here are a few of the things that I mentioned: 

* The importance of the bridge **to the play**.
* The importance of the bridge **to the reader**.
* The importance of the bridge **to the context**.
* The importance of the bridge **to the author**.

So, to the play, it provides an insight into the different lives between the injustified, migrant area of Brooklyn, as well as the justified side of New York (I think.. I can't remember the locations exactly, so I apologise if I get that wrong). That then links on to the reader, as it allows the reader to understand the **context** a bit better. The context, obviously, being about migrants from Italy coming over to America. Authorial context was the jackpot. Arthur Miller (the author) was involved in something called [McCarthyism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism). I can't remember 100% what I wrote for this, but I somehow managed to link McCarthyism and the bridge together. 

These are the things that examiners **love**. Another thing to mention is that it was always *the importance of the bridge to the [subject]*. Make sure that you read the question and answer the question. 

Feel free to PM me. Like I said, I'm not doing TKAM, I am however reading it, so I might be able to help after all. I wrote about Romeo &amp; Juliet for my literature coursework, so I should be able to help with that as well. 

PS - some other techniques such as PEE (point, evidence, explanation), PETER (Point, evidence, technique, explanation, reader's response) are really useful too. Make sure you learn key quotes, but try to learn the ones that are applicable to different parts in the book. For example, the migration of Simon (?) could represent the rape allegations that occur later on in the novella (I think that there's something to do with rape, because the one accused is black or something.. Then again, you can use that as social/historical context). It symbolises rape because of the entry of a foreign being into another country (similar with the mention of the rape in The Kite Runner, which symbolises the *rape* of Afghanistan by the USSR).

&gt;__McCarthyism__ is the practice of making accusations of subversion or treason without proper regard for evidence. It also means ""the practice of making unfair allegations or using unfair investigative techniques, especially in order to restrict dissent or political criticism.""  The term has its origins in the period in the United States known as the __Second Red Scare__, lasting roughly from 1950 to 1956 and characterized by heightened [political repression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_repression) against [communists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism), as well as a [campaign spreading fear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_mongering) of their influence on American institutions and of [espionage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage) by [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) agents. Originally coined to criticize the [anti-communist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-communist) pursuits of [Republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States\)) [U.S. Senator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate) [Joseph McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy) of [Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin), ""McCarthyism"" soon took on a broader meaning, describing the excesses of similar efforts. The term is also now used more generally to describe reckless, unsubstantiated accusations, as well as [demagogic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogy) attacks on the character or patriotism of political adversaries.

I'm currently living in the North East in Newcastle. I'm earning £23,000 PA. Regarding the car loan, it really isn't necessary at all. There was a car I always wanted and when I could afford it, I went for it. Bit naive, granted. 

Thank you for the perspective, it certainly helps. Although i'm a bachelor (prefer that to saying single and lonely ;) ).

I shall have a look on Zoopla, thanks for the suggestion. I've had a bit of a look at some houses / flats already, and it's really what has spurned the few questions I had. 

I'm going to start putting away maybe £300 (half of my 'throwaway' cash) and as the other poster suggested live a bit more frugally for the next few months / years. 

Thanks for the Experian suggestion too, it too is appreciated.

I've said appreciated a lot, but I truly appreciate the time you have taken to give me some advice, it means a lot and I will certainly use it.

Original pack dispensing is the preferred form of dispensing as it saves time and money.

The cost of loose flucloxacillin and amoxicillin tablets is outweighed by time spent looking for them. The majority of part packs end up in rhombic storage, never get used and then expire.

Most hospitals have also moved to robot dispensing systems which work with original packs, and part packs are a separate dispensing process which takes longer.

If you were discharged directly from the ward without pharmacy input, then you would only recieve original packs which are prelabelled because a ward is not a pharmacy and not allowed to dispense medication except in certain circumstances.",null,0,null,1422113085,null,0,false,0,cnzcxh3,null,t3_2tihgg,null,t1_cnzcxh3,null,t1_cnzcfvb,null,null,null,1424420375,null,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19,null

Granted, I do think it's a lot of money to spend on a car with the income I have, but I guess I was a bit naive in the fact I wanted this car since I was about 12, and could finally afford it. I'll certainly be more sensible with big purchases later. 

Also, thank you so much for your second paragraph, I seriously didn't take this into consideration AT ALL. It's actually a huge eye opener for me.

I shall be taking your advice on living frugally to afford this. I didn't think it was realistically an option to move out this year, but wanted this exact advice for or against the idea.

Thank you for your perspective too, I think i'm going to try and put away £300 (half of my 'throw away' money) each month, and build up a decent deposit over time. 

I'm looking to hopefully share with someone when I do move out, but it's not guaranteed.

As well as having some shows debut on iPlayer only.


I think it's a good idea to get your views across.

Imho I think a BBC1+1 is a crap idea especially since in the next few years the internet in streaming will only get bigger. I suggested that they make something like BBC Radio 4 Extra where they show programs which are interesting from the archives but would ordinarily never get shown on TV.

Across the waste of waters, she calls and calls to me.

Her sword is girded at her side, her helmet on her head,[6]

And around her feet are lying the dying and the dead;

I hear the noise of battle, the thunder of her guns;

I haste to thee, my mother, a son among thy sons.

And there's another country, I've heard of long ago,

Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know;

We may not count her armies, we may not see her King;

Her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering;

And soul by soul and silently her shining bounds increase,

And her ways are ways of gentleness, and all her paths are peace.",null,0,null,1422114639,null,0,false,0,cnzdj6h,null,t3_2ti0qp,null,t1_cnzdj6h,null,t3_2ti0qp,null,null,null,1424420015,null,8,false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,8,null

Since they've been transferred, I would say proof cannot be obtained from just pictures without them being played (and filmed), which is something that should be left to the professionals since VHS loses quality every time it is touched (be it played, rewound, etc).

Not sure why you would re-record something to VHS of all things for preservation, at least without keeping the original or being a collector and binning part of your collection. I'd have a decent look for the tins.


While this is entirely possible, I would doubt it. I'm no expert but I've never seen/heard of missing episodes in VHS format, even if re-recorded. These are much more likely to have been Loose Cannon's reconstructions since they get sent out via VHS than the actual episodes. Since he's already played them, it would be best to ask your neighbour a few questions to make sure (like ""Were there any still pictures during the episodes?"") then get onto Paul. Would you be able to get a decent shot of the label?

It may require a discussion in the mod team, but I think it best not to get people's hopes up for now.

&gt;

&gt;In the 1960s, controversial [Burnley F.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley_F.C.) Chairman [Bob Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lord_(football_chairman\)) successfully convinced fellow [Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League) Chairmen that televised matches on a Saturday afternoon would have a negative effect on the attendances of other football league games that were not being televised and as a result reduce their financial income.

&gt;As a result, [The FA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_FA), [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) and [Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League) do not want English matches to be televised live between 2:45pm and 5:15pm on a Saturday within the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom). Until recently, the FA Cup Final was an exception and had been broadcast at 3pm on a Saturday in May; however, in 2012, the FA Cup Final was moved to 5pm.

&gt;In February 2011, [Advocate General Kokott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliane_Kokott) of the [European Court of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice) opined that the ""closed periods"" did not encourage match attendance at other league games.

The instructors there were a great bunch, really friendly and approachable. Sat with us at lunch and had a good chat, made us feel very welcome. There were 5 groups of 2 students split across 6 instructors (one instructor on hand incase a student had to have a bit more one-to-one tuition). Was pissing with rain the entire day but had a great laugh and in many ways, that poor weather prepared me for riding in the worst of it.

**Theory**: Was in and out in 20 minutes. Was very much common sense if you've studied the highway code. Can very much recommend the Motorcycle Theory apps on your mobile. I think about £2.50 in all, but that really did help me get to grips with some motorcycle-specific points.

I don't really think paedophiles or terrorists are a big deal although I imagine GCHQ honestly want the power to stop them rather than spy on boring people like me, it just turns out that they do both to achieve one.

Ultimately though what can I really do? I wrote to my MP a couple of years ago about it and he gave me the ""I share your concerns but terrorists"" nonsense. I don't really think signing a petition is going to do anything, and I can't see anyone in my area standing against this for me to vote for. I could run myself, but I don't really have the time, money, or knowledge to do that, and it's not like I think it would work.

So I download a couple of no-track addons to my browser and hope for the best. It looks very much like this is going to happen whatever I do, unless the EU pass some law prohibiting it. My main tactic right now is to not vote UKIP, because that's literally all I can think to do which might have a minuscule impact, and I think if we leave the EU this sort of thing will get worse, although I'm not exactly clued in.

We're reasonably comfortable in the top half of the top flight. We're on a bit of a dip of form right now, but let's look at circumstance:

* We just sold our main goalscorer, but are yet to do anything substantial with the money. It's there, give it time. The presence of money itself doesn't improve a time, it's what you do with it. At this exact moment in time, we're *obviously* going to be weaker for the sale. 

* Ki, one of our top players, is away on international duty. That's out of Monk's hands. 

* Shelvey has sat out the last 4 games due to a suspension. Monk can work on discipline but at the end of the day he can't control moments of madness. 

* Due to the above two issues as well as Britton being less able to play constantly, our midfield has been weakened. The hammering against Chelsea was not acceptable, but it was heavily exacerbated by being forced to play two holding midfielders who can't tackle and are poor in the air.

* Tiendalli is poor. Naughton has just arrived but needs a moment to settle. The fullback depth issue is being resolved.

* Montero, one of our brighter players this year, only returned from injury today. He needed a game to get back into the flow of it. 

* Gomis is acting a cunt. You can't account for cunts. 

* Today wasn't one of them, but we've had *appalling* refereeing against us all season. We've got a thread from a week or so back to provide evidence of this. It has cost us a high number of points, certainly 6 or more. Monk can't account for awful refereeing decisions. 

* With Sigurdsson suspended (not Monk's fault), and Ki still gone, the poor form will continue for a little bit yet. That doesn't mean we throw Monk to the dogs straight off the bat, and a bad atmosphere in the fanbase *will* transfer to the pitch.

This is probably the strongest tone I've put on a post the entire time I've been involved in this subreddit, but it needs saying (and please understand I say this as a Swans fan and not as a mod, because with my mod hat on I have no issue with your post) :

If you're going to get wobbly over a short run of bad results, I'd much prefer it if you held your tongue than start aggravating for us to ditch a club legend who has done an excellent job. Have a word with yourself here; look at where we are in the table, then look at our finishes since we got to the top flight. In fact, look at our finishes in the last twenty years. If all you've got to offer is 'has he taken us as far as he can?', you're quite clearly talking absolute shit because we're **well** within reach of possibly having our **highest ever league position finish in our century history**, and the bloke has only been in the job for a year if that. He hasn't even finished getting his badges yet, he's still learning. Get a grip mate.

Offer me more than a weak sentence of why you think this and I won't be so condescending but I can't tolerate this sort of nonsense because it is **toxic** and will make things a lot worse than they need to be. Positive support will carry us through the other side, but turning on the whole team will add pressure, nervousness and fear into their game.

If you have the right grades, robust extracurricular stuff, and interview skills to get into medical school you'd be better off doing something else if you want to make piles of cash.  Do you realise that Aldi pay their store managers £35k, which can go up to £52k after four years of satisfactory reviews?  This is graduate entry.  That is more than many registrars get, and is a quicker increase relative to time spent training.  A salaried GP will be on about £55-60k for reference.

Current medical salaries are appropriate for most roles, when you consider that many doctors have a huge amount of individual responsibility, and there is a huge level of professional risk.  Your career can be ended for reasons that simply would not apply in many other roles.  Remember there is up to ten years or further training and examinations after completing medical school.  I would concede that some medical roles are overpaid but that's mainly because they don't do on call.  For example, a pathologist's on call will be far less onerous than mine is, or an ED doc's is, yet they are paid the same.

Unilaterally changing patent arrangements would destroy the pharmaceutical industry by massively reducing the risk companies are prepared to take in developing new drugs.

This is a higher growth rate required than a number of previous reports. Most of the previous reports have suggested that NHS spending would need to rise to 13% of GDP by 2060, in order to care for all the elderly people.

One criticism with some of those reports is that they haven't taken into account the increasing availability of high technology treatments with their higher costs. 

One key government report in 2002, did specifically warn that the aging population would mean fewer young people to recruit to jobs in the NHS, especially as emigration was becoming easier and other countries were prioritising health spending. It specifically said that NHS salaries had to be ""world class"" otherwise it would be unable to recruit enough staff to meet demand.

As far as I can tell, all of the main parties (with the exception of UKIP, who have a pretty shady record of climate change denial among their ranks) express some commitment to the environment. As long as it remains a core issue of the party, the big parties who will actually win seats will try to re-align their policy set to woo potential green party supporters. 

The greens were never going to be the ones to actually change climate policy, much in the same way that UKIP were never going to be the ones to take us out of the EU. UKIP (or my understanding of it at least) was a small economic libertarian party that advocated EU withdrawal. It's only since they've began conflating the EU membership issue with nationalism to woo the bigot vote that they've posed a challenge to the Conservatives, and now we're very likely to have an EU membership referendum during the next parliamentary term. 

Similarly with the greens, the more support they can steal from Labour/the Lib Dems, the more likely those parties are to change their policy sets.

Seem to remember? I would like to see that cos that sounds like bullshit to me. Given their very scant media coverage until recently though, policy specifics could maybe lacking; though I find it very hard to beleive that most people don't know the greens general ideas; tax the rich(yes, this includes the middle class) and protect the environment are pretty simple. 

Given that http://voteforpolicies.org.uk/ has the greens way out in the lead I woould be a little surprised tbh.

&gt;
My analysis has shown that the following demographic groups voted for the Greens in 2014:
&gt;
Well educated singles living in purpose built flats
&gt;
City dwellers owning houses in older neighbourhoods
&gt;
Singles and sharers occupying converted Victorian houses
&gt;
Young professional families settling in better quality older terraces
&gt;
Diverse communities of well-educated singles living in smart, small flats
&gt;
Owners in smart purpose built flats in prestige locations, many newly built
&gt;
Students and other transient singles in multi-let houses
Young renters in flats with a cosmopolitan mix

The thing is that the BBC choose what is on TV. They also choose the footage that is sent internationally. That's what you're not understanding. What the BBC shows is what the international lot get. Also as I type this, fuck Halliday. Anyway, the point is more that to international fans, there will still be a game that those people will watch, as you bloody well proved saying you'll watch City.

The fact is in England we're used to it, we have the 3 o'clock thing and we have this too. It's not an issue to us. Internationally there aren't contracts to show you things we don't show live. There are for the PL and that's pretty much it. And then to get proven value from it you'd have to essentially prove why, being that a TV channel paying more for these games to be broadcast live and get their commentators then.

So as a result, they pretty much base it on odds of it being an interesting game to the neutral. As always football is football and you'll probably see Bradford televised next round if they continue with this result.

The guy who threatened the old woman. He could have had a £300 fine or time in jail according to the choices made. That's pretty broad.

The murder case - anywhere between 10 years and 35+.

A slider with a range spanning the sentencing guidelines would have been cool though. But even then, we can see there were lots of guidelines - like the drug dealer woman where there were different guidelines corresponding to different numbers of pills.

Currently, if somebody is commiting offences via email, it's all but impossible to catch them.  You submit a check on the email addresses (will take 2-3 months to come back), which will come back to an IP.  You have to submit a further check on that IP (a further 2-3 months).  The IP will come back to an unregistered phone number, that you can submit FURTHER checks on that (another 2-3 months) to finally tell you, a year down the line, there is no way of tracing said person.  

All those checks have to be incredibly specific about time and place used, etc, which is why they're so quickly out of date (eg, that check you submitted on that IP 6 months ago is no longer in date, probably no longer used, and records no longer kept).  Vast majority of those checks need authority of a Superintendent, who are very senior officers with not a lot of time.

Under this act, you could submit a request to investigate said phone number/email and any with direct links to it for a specified period of time for the purpose of your investigation, and get that authorized at once.  That would make a huge amount of internet based crime potentially solvable.  

Right now, if a victim tells me the only clue they have is an email or phone number, I have to honestly tell them there is a very, very very slim chance of us being able to do anything with it.

now lets address some of your points, as the smallest of are current DM's i can forgive him not having the greatest Arial prowess, not that i can actually think of any of the multiple times you are implying this has happened, i'll admit, when he first came into the team he made some silly mistakes that lead to goals, however he seems to be improving his decision making every week, giving the ball away a lot less in recent fixtures, he shot on goal are tame, i'll give you that, however it's not really what i look for in a DM, its would be a nice bonus but not really the area he should excel in, and how you can't rate his tackling i don't know.

what i will mention is i just wen't back and watched the highlights from the West Brom game, and im still waiting to see where Besic put a foot wrong all game? ...some decent tackles, some great through balls, and most of his shots took deflections ...

you keep hating on him, but all i can see is the fact that without his movement and pace in midfield we would be caught out multiple times when we give the ball away, with the rest of our midfield and defense being slow as fuck, hes always the one tracking back, blocking crosses, applying pressure to opposition forwards and yes i'd much rather we had a fully fit James McCarthy doing that job in the middle of the park, but we don't!",null,0,null,1422118592,null,0,false,0,cnzfaad,null,t3_2tcoas,null,t1_cnzfaad,null,t1_cnywqn1,null,null,null,1424419198,null,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1,null

You absolute fucking Moron. You have no concept of what Republicanism is. You are a nationalist catholic defenderist, you are not a Republican. You and your ilk are a cancer to Republican ideals. It was the Ulster Scot and Gaelic Irish who formed the United Irishmen. 

&gt; It's a bit like trying to force the blacks and whites in South Africa to mix and create babies, there is nothing wrong with segregation as long as we don't murder each other

What the fuck is wrong with you. Republicanism is not Genetic, it is not an Identity and it is not simply a culture, it is a materialist political Ideal open to anyone. The clue is quite literally in the name.

&gt; ‘Res’ is a nominative singular Latin noun for a substantive or concrete thing – as opposed to ‘spes’, which means something unreal or ethereal – and ‘publica’ is an attributive adjective meaning ‘of and/or pertaining to the state or the public’. Hence a literal translation is, ‘the public thing/affair’.

Republicanism is not about false social constructs and explicitly warns against fostering differences in the 1916 Proclamation.

&gt; The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and all of its parts, **cherishing all of the children of the nation equally and oblivious of the differences carefully fostered by an alien government, which have divided a minority from the majority in the past.**

A genuine Republican would embrace the desegregation of our society, to break down the barriers and carefully fostered differences, but you are nothing of the sort.

Dembele and Capoue awful, genuine, GOD AWFUL joke of a CM pairing. Capoue constantly lost his man, didn't track runs, made late timed tackles. Dembele, well he was Dembele. Sideways, backwards, holds on to the ball, doesn't shoot. They were just an utter joke today in the middle of the park. The amount of times you saw Paulinho ask Dembele for the pass and he just dilly dallyed and held on for it to be tackled. 

Kaboul is done, lets just get rid of the guy ASAP. Not only is he an awful defender he has now lost any respect he had within the squad. He kept shouting at Vlad and Fazio at times when the problems at the back were caused by him. 

If Eriksen, Bentaleb or Mason aren't playing there is zero creativity in that side. Townsend did well to slot home the penalty but from Block 33 I really failed to see what he offered to the side. 

I doubt they'll put on a decent highlights package but if you went to the game feel free to put in your opinion. 

That's the end of Capoue, Dembele and Kaboul at Tottenham today for me. I would mention Soldado but I can't be bothered, I've moaned about him too much lately to waste any more time on him. His game improves when Lamela is in the side no doubt but I honestly don't see how he can stay beyond the summer here.

I'm going to the barn to check them out. I don't think he knows that they're missing.
I don't know much about how they got there ( I only told him to be careful with them) but I know that his grandpa traveled around the world. I also know that he was some sort of a TV things collector ( I remember him showing us his collection a bit before he passed away)
How do we proceed with this? Should we contact BBC? Apparently, the episodes are full and in working condition...

I think that rather than saying /r/UK leans to the left, it's more accurate to say that the prevailing opinion is generally that of social liberalism. Sort of like a backlash against the neoliberalism that pervades modern politics and is widely regarded as having led to the economic crash a few years back.

Aguero is frustrating as fuck at times.  He's a tremendous player, and sometimes its good for a striker to be selfish, but Jesus how many times he made the wrong decisions this game, dropping his head down and trying to dribble through players..it was astounding.

Milner again was MOTM for me, and Navas played well.  Silva tried but he's still too reluctant to shoot.  

Jovetic was same old stevan--skillful and links up well, but forces too many one-twos when the space isn't there.  It seems like it is going to take ALOT for him to get a goal, which isn't a good feeling to have when he's one of your forwards.

A toy factory. There is no reason to suppose otherwise.  

&gt;How did it get into Rupert's orphanage?

It was bought from a shop or donated.  

&gt;What did Rupert do with it after Clara and the Doctor left?

Kept it and passed it to the next generation of his family (e.g. a nephew). We know he has family of some kind: his date with Clara was delayed by ""family stuff"".   

&gt;What did the Doctor do with it after Clara gave it to him?  

Unknown. It could be in the TARDIS somewhere, but probably still on Gallifrey, unless he had it in his pocket when he left.  

&gt;Who had the toy soldier first, Rupert or Orson?  

Rupert.

Although there was a lot of speculation on Clara's pregnancy following the post-its in *Dark Waters*, since *Last Christmas* is set 6 months later, it would be pretty obvious by then.  

Moffat has suggested that Orson is descended from another branch of the Pink family in answer to a question in DWM.

The risk is not just of a full on crazy government, but of low level misuse. People should also think of the police behaviour towards Doreen Lawrence or after the Hillsborough disaster and how they could have misused the surveillance system, or people who have a business or personal dispute with the official who lives next door. People can imagine those things, and they have a plausibility that Ed Milliband winning the election and turning out to be the next Stalin doesn't.

We would have to move back to Australia, really there are not many options fortunately I have my ILR/PR for the UK so it's not an issue for me but it is for thousands of others. 

There is room for reform if you wanted to make it a issue for the election - you could stop accepting refugees and only give temporary visas until their original country has settled (5-10-15 years) and they would never have any right to remain in the UK. You cannot stop Europeans from coming to the UK but I suspect you don't take issue with French/Italians coming here. 

From when I came to the UK close to a decade ago the visa rules have gotten harder and harder to the point where you need to be exceptionally fortunate to qualify. I think there is room to reduce the number of non tertiary education visas (short courses, exploited while people work in excess of the allowed hours)

First Sterling takes a run, gets blocked, then it's Coutinho's turn to run at the defence, he loses it. Then Lallana picks it up on the half way line, plays a one-two with Sterling and runs straight into their defence. It's painful to watch.

Henderson and Allen are both playing too deep, and I'm not fully sure why. We don't need that much coverage for the defence, Allen can stay back and Henderson should really be up playing just behind Coutinho and Lallana, dictating the pace of the game. That's exactly what we'd have had Stevie doing today.

Enrique isn't at it. I love him...I really do. But he's not good enough any more. His legs are just gone and he can't play the wing-back role at all. He was great at attacking back earlier in his career but he can't make it up and back any more and ends up in this middle-of-the-road position where he's not helping the attackers or the defenders. Manquillo has just been average. Hasn't done anything wrong but hasn't done anything right.

And my god if Migs does that again I'll personally fly over to Anfield and kick him up the ass.

Not working as a team. Players are taking turns to run at the 6 man Bolton defence rather than working as a unit to break them down. First Sterling takes a run, gets blocked, then it's Coutinho's turn to run at the defence, he loses it. Then Lallana picks it up on the half way line, plays a one-two with Sterling and runs straight into their defence. It's painful to watch.

Henderson and Allen are both playing too deep, and I'm not fully sure why. We don't need that much coverage for the defence, Allen can stay back and Henderson should really be up playing just behind Coutinho and Lallana, dictating the pace of the game. That's exactly what we'd have had Stevie doing today.

Enrique isn't at it. I love him...I really do. But he's not good enough any more. His legs are just gone and he can't play the wing-back role at all. He was great at attacking back earlier in his career but he can't make it up and back any more and ends up in this middle-of-the-road position where he's not helping the attackers or the defenders. Manquillo has just been average. Hasn't done anything wrong but hasn't done anything right.

We need to press high, dictate the pace of the game, control possession and just keep constant pressure on their two banks of four. They'll crack. They're no Chelsea.

*Then* in the libel case  Mr Justice Mitting found that on the balance of probabilities Mitchell *had* used the P word or something equally pejorative. The papers unkindly spun part of this as PC Toby Rowland being too stupid to lie. But by this point both the police and Mitchell looked bad and the press lost interest.

**CBT**: Did the first one OK, but didn't feel confident enough to go out on the road, re-took it the following weekend and was fine.

**Intervening 8 months on L plates:** Little to report. Much pootling about on a 125, mostly realising how vulnerable a biker is and how little of a shit some motorists give about the safety of others if it saves them 1 car space/5 seconds/getting through the lights before they turn red. Got rear-ended at lights because a car driver was both too close and not paying attention. Was under 5mph, no damage. He admitted fault.

**Theory:** Easy, sort of. I'd been studying the highway code for the previous 8 months, so the questions were easy as hell, it was the hazard perception part which almost caused me to fail as i spotted more hazards than were apparently in the test. 1 more click and i'd have failed.

**MOD1:** Lots of fun. Did a lot of country A roads and all the usual stuff. Test was straight-forward enough. Couple of minors. Told i go too fast around roundabouts.

**MOD2:** Practice/Refresher was all good, the test itself is where the nerves set in. Had maybe 7 minors i think. Still told i go too fast around roundabouts.

**The 6+ months since:** Fun being on a 600. I still go at a fair speed around roundabouts, 1 speed awareness course for doing 40 in a 30. Dropped the bike once in a car park because i forgot to take the disc lock off.

We're meant to be a party that supports social justice and equality and tolerance, and this isn't someone we should be happy about standing as a candidate if he's willing to spout ignorance and bigotry, then nonpologise by blaming twitter.

As for his points, stopping women from using public toilets is not a tenable stance, whatever the reason those particular women are prevented. Transwomen are factorially more at risk being forced to use mens toilets than women are at risk from other women who happen to be trans. Read is here taking the side of TERFs - trans-exclusionary radical feminists, a toxic and unpleasant wing of feminism which itself should be condemned in the most stringent language, and which group has been accused of doxing transwomen, outing them to their employers, accusing them of crimes to their employers (without, of course, any evidence or due process) and sending death threats to trans activists.

As for criticising the use of ""cis"", what utter nonsense. It's like the people who, thirty-odd years ago, didn't want to be called heterosexual because they were ""normal"". Cis is a neutral descriptor to enable discussion, not a slur. Those who say it is a slur only do so to further their own agenda of othering transpeople. And they're mostly TERFs, surprise surprise.

That Rupert Read expresses such views - views which are in alignment with a hateful, toxic and extreme branch of feminism - is evidence that he is not suitable as a candidate. We have a responsibility to condemn him along with his TERF buddies, as he undermines the core values of equality and understanding the Green Party should be able to proudly demonstrate. He undermines also the faith the trans community and allies have in this party.

That there has been as yet no comment from the high ups in the party is to me very worrying. This isn't something that should be brushed under the rug.

Fake edit: http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/may/11/amateur-sleuths-forensic-gadgets-auction

&gt;Got a pile of cash to spend? **The highest bid on a 2005 Scanning Electron Microscope with EDAX (for compositional analysis) and an infrared chamber scope is only £15k. A PCR system (for magnifying small amounts of DNA) is going for £150, and a genetic analyser for £6k.** There are enough pipettes, thermometers and dewars to fill your boots.

&gt;Some of the most intriguing items are more obscure. For £30 (unless someone bids more) you can get something called an ESDA, which uses electrostatics to read the indentations left on a sheet of paper that was underneath another sheet being written on. For £150, a bullet puller is yours, if you are stuck for a device to remove slugs from their cases. The kevlar gun holdalls are just £50, a bank note counter only £40. And for a tenner, there's a dazzling 1,000W spotlight (with four spare bulbs).

&gt;Amjad Bashir, a Ukip MEP and the party’s leading Asian figure, told The Telegraph that Ukip had become a “party of ruthless self-interest” that was incapable of delivering a referendum on membership of the European Union.

&gt;In a damning broadside against his former colleagues, he described Ukip as “pretty amateur” and condemned its “ridiculous” lack of policies. He said the party was “delusional” about its chances of winning seats in May.

Well, hes not wrong on the amateur or ridiculous lack of policies front. In the last couple of months we've seen several times where party members dont know what the actual policy is and have pretty much made it up on the fly. And thats before UKIPs policy guy, responsible for writing the manifesto, got booted from UKIP earlier this week because he was too focussed on winning his seat than writing the document.

If you buy you're still paying interest on a mortgage. Let's say someone had a 200k mortgage. Interest rates are low right now but let's say in a few years time they were back up and were around 5%. That would be 10k a year the person would be paying before they even started paying their mortgage off. 

Whatever you do, just be sure to factor in all the details. What interest will you be paying? Can you afford the size of mortgage? Are you likely to move within 5 years? What happens if interest rates go up. Can you survive it? If you have a sizeable deposit then how does money you could earn off that invested elsewhere compare with the dent on the interest it'd make by reducing the mortgage you need? etc etc. You have to weigh it all up.

Vorm was quite good today I thought. He made 2 good saves early on, one of which was a world class point blank save. He was also commanding in the box and looked solid when catching. From my angle though their last goal was his fault so that did let down the rest if his performance.  
  
Chiriches was alright. He made quite a few solid standing tackles but he played dangerously and gave the ball away quite a few times. Also stood off a few times when I felt he should have closed down.  
 
 I thought fazio was pretty solid. Didn't make many mistakes and did quite well.   
  
Kaboul was below par. I thought he lost a few aerial duals he should have won. Also out of position a far bit.  
  
The midfield trio of capoue, dembele and paulinho look poor.  Capoue started well, won quite a few tackles but late on lost the ball quite alot. Dembele held the ball well but did add much to the attack. Paulinho was poor I thought. He really doesn't add anything at all to the team in defence or attack. Lots of sideways and backwards passes. Whenever he got the ball it looked like he looked backwards first. Also missed a couple of chances one of which he should have definitely scored.  
 Wingers were alright but they both didn't do much. Lamela looked quite good at points. Definitely looks better at holding people off the ball but still not brilliant. Also he made a hash of a good free kick chance which led to their goal.  
  
Soldado looked quite good. Put in a shift and had a few good touches and passes. He didn't have many chances to miss but hopefully he will get into better positions. Adebayor wasn't bad when he came on.

Willian has no end product in the final third, therefore Ivanovic darts forward all the time to essentially play RW, therefore Cahill is left to cover an entire half of the pitch, and he isn't that good at holding a high line anyways, especially when he has so much ground to cover.

Therefore, if we had Cuadrado, who works a million times better in wide areas than Willian does, and has more creativity in the final third, we wouldn't need Ivanovic to bomb forward so far, and Cahill wouldn't be as exposed. Has Cahill been poor this year? Absolutely. But part of that is the system being played. I actually think Zouma is a better fit for the system. 

As for Schurrle, we can't wait around for him to just magically flip the switch and turn around his form. I'm not saying we should get rid of him, god no, he still offers something that none are other wingers do, but we need a RW who can give width to the team, work in tight spaces, and puts in a shift defensively, all of which Cuadrado does really well. 

We wouldn't be buying Cuadrado just because Salah isn't world class, we'd be buying Cuadrado to strengthen our team and address a flaw that we have currently, Willian's a good player, but Cuadrado is the better player. Why shouldn't we strengthen our team? It's not exactly like $ is an issue. I don't think we can win CL with our squad as it is, do you? Does buying Cuadrado magically mean we'll win it, fuck no, but it means we have a better chance.

If we had a real striker we are up 3/4-0 in the first half...Sterling is so indecisive, you can tell he's not a striker. 

The announcer said late, ""Liverpool definitely don't deserve the win here today, they look like the November team"". You're a fucking idiot, Bolton's best chance was a shot that was 6 feet wide of the goal, while Bogdan made like 5-6 saves to bail out his team. Also the two knobs were saying around the 80th minute, why BR isn't bringing in Lambert and I'm sitting there thinking, ""Markovic for Enrique at half, Lucas for Allen, Borini for Manquillo"". Do you dumb shits not know how to count...They pissed me off more than the actual game did.

Lallana was horrible in my book today, as was Sterling. They looked lost and indecisive (which is the antithesis of what we've seen from those two lately).

Henderson was so damn good today, and was unlucky not to score one.

Also thought the ref was a joke, Lallana got hacked 4-5 times in the first without a call, he let Mills hack Markovic at the edge of the box, that's easily a second yellow. The pen call for Hendo was debatable but still that gets called quite often IMO.

One positive I will say is our defense finally looks like a decent unit, that can somewhat shuffle players in.

What really made me want to watch season 2 was the fact that I oved Eccleston so much and at the end of the seaosn BOOM he disappears and I sooo much wanted to see the rest.
 
Depending on your friend, the slitheens episodes are a must pick/must ban. If he doesn't care about bad special effects (which he shouldn't if he is to keep watching Dr Who) and likes this kind of dumb things (I really love these episodes, although I completely get that someone doesn't enjoy them) then yeah go with them. Also ""Rose"" is important because it sets the characters, despite it being one of the worst episodes ;) (warn him that it' sbad and it gets better :P)

Something else you need to take into account is the fact that RST's era is more focused on the characters while Moffat's is obviously more focused on the plot and more ""serious"". So you might want to jump straight to Amy's first episodes and go on from there. And although I think it's a shame to miss the first seasons of the NuWho, I can get that the esthetics  
may look to ""amateur"" for people used to quality SFX. But face of boe, harkness, strax, donna, rose.... You NEED to see these people ;) 

Finally, for me Regeneration needs to be a surprise and not be spoiled by episodes from further seasons. So in the end, my list would probably be : 

* Rose
* Dalek
* Empty child/Dr dances
* Bad Wolf/Parting of the way
* Christmas invasion 
* Tooth and calw

Tell him that there might me some continuity issues as he didn't watch all the episodes (for instance in Bad Wolf he won't understand why the Doctor thinks he caused humanity to get lost)  and that if at any points he feels like he'll enjoy the show to simply stop in this list and start watching in the right order. I think that a lot of the Rose/Doctor stroy also comes from episodes in Eccleston part and that's why they are important. Also Harriet Jones is introduced there.

I understand the point because this sort of wastage might appear to be happening on a big scale but it does seem a little odd to me since I was once a hospital pharmacy tech and there's literally no reason to oversupply like this.  Usually ABs will be supplied to the exact number of caps/tabs needed since oversupply just increases the chance of the patient overrunning their course so I suspect what's happened here is someone being lazy and not doing the quick calculation in their head/not willing/not allowed to take the drugs out of the box and cutting off the required amount.

In the UK we tend to supply only blister packed medication so common drugs like antibiotics come packaged in commonly used amounts for AB courses.  Your case is a little out of the ordinary in being such a short course however.  If it was ward supply then its likely pharmacy weren't involved at all and maybe nurses aren't allowed to modify the contents of prepackaged drugs, I'm not sure.  Ideally pharmacy would be involved in the supply of all drugs from hospitals but I know that just introduces delays in busy hospitals, they likely just wanted you out quickly.

I think Willian is quality, he's has the ability to absolutely control games whereas Cuadrado seems to be just another winger. A good one mabey but I really don't think we need him. Schürrle needs game time to regain his form back, he's been subbed before half time on 4 different occasions this year, that's pretty awful, Mou has shown rotation isn't a top priority for him, therefore buying Cuadrado would pretty much be a direct replacement for Willian.

You would think that this mean recording something like the name of the website only. However, technical and legal experts have suggested that this actually means that the entire URL should be recorded. 

So, this means not just browsing youtube or flickr, but keeping a record of exactly what videos or photos were viewed. Or if you use a search engine, exactly what you searched for and which links you clicked on.

The risk is that there may be spurious connections made. E.g. your daughter is doing some homework and looks up ""potassium nitrate"", meanwhile you are looking to buy a new pressure cooker, so you are searching for pressure cookers. 

Both items are potentially useful for bomb making. What is to stop this being flagged, and an assault team sent to your house?

There were people at the Cambridge game last night who will have got the bug and will now go more often, maybe even buy a season ticket next year, buy a programme every week, bring their son and buy him a shirt.

If the FA decided to maximise broadcast revenues then it would be an entirely different business model and the lower league clubs would not get a look in.
