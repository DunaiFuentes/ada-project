By asking for an inquiry what they've done is achieve future headlines on this subject... it might have been easier to just dismiss it as absurd and move on. The more they dwell on this, the more it costs them momentum. 

I don't for a second think this will in any way change their prospects in Scotland... but it might stoke anti-SNP feeling in the UK where voters are more skeptical of the SNP. At the very least it has probably put the dampers on thursday nights SNP-mania. 

That might not seem very important, but it is. Sturgeon is (allegedly anyway) banking on a labour pact... her ability to do that will depend on English perceptions of the SNP.

Let me give you an example... in 2010 the SDSR sat down and fleshed out what they thought British defense priorities should be. They essentially decided that state-on-state warfare was finished and that future conflicts would be asymmetrical threats from terrorist or rogue states. 

[Then this happened](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014%E2%80%9315_Russian_military_intervention_in_Ukraine)...

The point is defense is by its very nature hard to predict. Trying to build a long term defense plan is like trying to buy a ""future-proof"" computer. It doesn't work that way. You make choices made on the best available information at the time. Right now, that information backs a strong and credible independent nuclear deterrent. That deterrent is in the political, international and economic interests of the UK. It isn't going anywhere right now. 

Does that mean it will always be that way? Clearly not. If anti-missile technologies and point-defense systems develop further then we might reach a stage where a large ICBM style deterrent is intrinsically vulnerable and we go back to other strategies - like saturation assaults or covert delivery techniques. I don't know what the future holds... but as things stand, Trident will be renewed. It's just that simple.

null,false,myfootballaccount,rangers,,null,"&gt; I dropped the TV point because it quickly became clear you didn't have a clue.

Right, sure you did.

&gt; Hence the reason I said the last season Rangers contributed NEW RESULTS.

Well which season is it then? If you don't mean the last season they played in Europe, and you don't mean the last season they played and actually made some progress, then what is left? There is no other season where they contributed results.

Also when did I declare a win? and when did I lose? What have I lied about?

&gt; This is the first you've mentioned a swing of any description.

It's the first time I've mentioned a swing explicitly, does that mean it didn't exist before I said it? No, of course not. It has forever been implicit in the data. Am I not allowed to expand on things I've previously said?  I don't understand why you think there is something wrong with introducing new points as you've done it several times yourelf... but when I do it you claim I'm somehow changing the goalposts.

&gt; You were just looking at a direct comparison. Keep it there.

Please enlighten me to what this direct comparison this was and when I made it? 

I presented data, and everything I've done since is an exploration of that same data. There are many comparisons and insights you can make from it. My overall point is that the coefficient is correlated with Rangers performances and ability to play in Europe. 

&gt; I'm disingenuous? 

I said you were disingenuous for misrepresenting what I had previously written.  I gave a specific example.

&gt; I'm not the one who has changed the rules to suit himself, despite what you might claim.

What rules? You might not have changed them, whatever they may be, but you have changed your opinion, and your interpretation of the information throughout this discussion.  Again, I've given an example of you doing this. You have not given an example of any ""rule changes"" I've made, or of when I've ""moved the goalposts"". Your accusations are becoming more spurious and your arguments less cogent.

&gt; The only problem with my analogy, is it no longer suits what you're NOW doing.

I'll repeat, the problem with your analogy is that you are comparing two unrelated time periods, unlike the data I've been discussing which is from a single time period and is what you might call a time-series.

1946 may have been the last time the UK executed someone for treason, but it was still a punishment on the statute books for a long time after. I imagine we would have executed people for high treason after that if we had convicted them. But the war was over so there weren't many treason cases coming up.

&gt; If we are a progressive nation we don't have a justice system that looks backwards to punish.

""Progressive"" is quite a meaningless political concept as it supposes there is even such a thing as natural political progress. Progress in a political system is whatever you want it to be. I wouldn't see tougher treason punishments as backwards, I would see it as progress. I think you'll also find a lot of people in this country who don't necessarily share your ""progressive"" ideals and see British values as something very different.

&gt; I don't have an issue with the current sentencing guidelines (maximum of life imprisonment), do you?

The problem here is that maximum life imprisonment is only a theoretical guideline. As we all know, life imprisonment seldom results in a criminal spending their entire life in prison. Plus with Islamist terrorists, there's always the prospect that they could radicalise other prisoners, so would consider it to be necessary to keep them in solitary confinement (Cue howls of liberal outrage).

However, if whole life tariffs were guaranteed (With absolutely no prospect of release under any circumstances) and solitary confinement used for the most dangerous prisoners (Especially Islamic extremists), I would certainly accept that as an alternative to the death penalty.

On buying established players vs youth talent 
---
In fantasy land, Liverpool is able to attract top established players with no consistent CL football and no excessive wages. That's fantasy land though, a place many fans here are dreaming in. Liverpool are a big club that spends a lot, but in the league where we are competing, the EPL, there are four clubs that can and do spend more than us.

You really think Daniel Levy and Liverpool's transfer committee hasn't been desperately trying to attract 'world-class established talent'? People think that Spurs made a mistake by buying loads of good but not great players; I think they bought the best players that were willing to come at reasonable money. 

Stop dreaming about 'buying established world-class talents'. Unless we get very lucky or are willing to pay ludicrous amounts of money, no such players are coming. For the last 10-15 years, all the great players that played for Liverpool established themselves as truly great AT liverpool. Suarez, Torres, Alonso, Mascherano, Reina, Lucas. The best, already-established, player we bought in the last 10 years is Glen Johnsen. 

Wake up guys. Its not that the LFC transfer committee doesn't want to buy top established talent. Its that no top-class talent wants to come unless we pay crazy money, but there are four clubs in this league that can spend more than us.


On Liverpool's performance this season
---
Just look at the quality of our squad. There is a clear gulf in quality and depth between Liverpool and our rivals Man Utd/Arsenal. We have the edge over Spurs in first XI quality, but Spurs probably have better depth overall. Demanding that Rodgers be sacked for achieving 5th/6th, the level which the squad is at, is ludicrous. You sack underperforming managers or managers that seem to be going nowhere; Rodgers is doing NEITHER.

In the first half of the season, the loss of SAS meant that we had to radically adjust the way our team played as compared to last season. How can you not expect the team to struggle during a transition phase, where our team radically reshapes and adjusts to the loss of our superstar talisman and the introduction of new players? 

Btw, Man United played like shit and struggled to adjust just like we did. The difference is that they had world-class established players to bail them out, whereas we had young players fluffing up chances, players losing confidence and dropping out of form (can anyone blame Rodgers for Migs losing confidence and form from out of nowhere?). Again, this boils down to overall squad quality.

The test of Rodger's quality as a manager would be whether or not he would be able to turn the team around and recover. And he did that. Honestly, I thought it would take him next season to recover because very few managers manage to do it mid-season, but much to my surprise, Rodgers managed it. Btw, Klopp and Dortmund shat the bed far worse than we did, and Dortmund has a significantly stronger squad than we do, so it makes me laugh when I see the Rodgersout wagon suggesting Klopp as a replacement.

If we get top four this season, it would be an over-achievement. Fifth/sixth is par for course. But par for course is good enough for me if progress is made, and the young age of our squad means that our team is only going to improve.

On Liverpool's long term strategy/Going forward
--- 

How is Liverpool going to get back into the top four when there are four other clubs that are 1 or 2 steps ahead in squad quality, prestige and financial power? 

If we traded transfers with Man United, i'm very confident that we would be in the top four instead of United. We got Markovic, they got Di Maria, we got Moreno, they got Blind, we got Lovren, they got Rojo, we got Lambert, they got Falcao (meh, you have your fair share of duds even when buying 'established talent'), we got Lallana, they got Herrera.

But we can't afford the money. Even if we could, the players DON'T WANT TO COME. Our 'marquee' signing is Balotelli, a supremely talented player that no one else wants for obvious reasons.

The only sane and reasonable strategy (or we could do a Portsmouth/Leeds like some fans are suggesting) is FSG's current policy; buy talented young players who are willing to come for reasonable money and focus on youth. We cannot buy a top four team, we have to develop one.

Some of them, like Sterling, are going to want to leave for bigger clubs once they become established. That's the reality when you don't have the financial muscle and prestige to compete. What we need to hope for is that some of those that establish themselves here will be willing to stay and play for us. Because we don't have the ability to buy top 4 material players, we have to develop top 4 material players. Players like Can, Coutinho, Henderson, Sakho, Sterling and Ibe. 

This squad is raw, but it has loads of potential to build on. On hindsight, last season is a bit of a curse, because we suddenly have deluded supporters thinking that this squad is actually top 4 material. We massively over-achieved due to Suarez and Rodger's ability to get the most out of him but some fans seem to think its the level this Suarez-less squad should be competing at.

If you look just based on results, it does seem like its one step forward one step back under Rodgers. But if you look at our actual squad quality, depth, and age, we have made big strides. It's still going to be a consistent struggle for top four for the forseeable future, but that's the best strategy LFC has at the moment.",null,0,null,1428181354,null,0,false,0,cq1acdv,null,t3_31fv8r,null,t1_cq1acdv,null,t3_31fv8r,null,null,null,1432197226,null,32,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,32,null

As I posted elsewhere, I agree. The UK is still hanging onto the power and influence it had in the previous century, however I think this century will see that decline further.

When this argument comes around again regarding the replacement of the replacement, I expect many of the same arguments will be wheeled out. We'll lose our standing in the world, who knows what the future holds, once we lose that technical ability we can't get it back, etc.

I think all of those arguments are pretty flawed today, I don't think they'll strengthen over time, so for me it's largely a question of when we disarm rather than if.

Unexpected situations like the Ukraine will, of course, continue to occur. I doubt very much if you'll see new nuclear powers within the EU as a result though - Germany's far closer to that front-line than we are yet the suggestion that they should obtain nuclear weapons ""just in case"" would be seen as lunacy.",null,0,null,1428181469,null,0,false,0,cq1aejk,null,t3_31amnk,null,t1_cq1aejk,null,t1_cq1a5k5,null,null,null,1432197254,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Some people will recommend against any ""cheap"" bike gear of any variety and in part, for good reason. You can get some truly shoddy stuff online (which is where I have bought 100% of my bike clothing) and because this stuff is the difference between life and death - quite literally - it's important you sort the wheat from the chaff. Be very wary when buying from online retailers. Type in ""Motorcycle jacket"" on eBay and you get oodles of results that I wouldn't let me cat wear, let alone me or the SO. I dread to think what would happen if you looked for helmets.. I would also recommend *against* second hand bike gear, *especially helmets*. Of all the things to go on you when you take the bike out, the helmet is the most important. If you can afford to go a little bit further with a helmet, you will likely do yourself a favor.

As a gear ""budget"" to start out, I would allocate £120-£150. That would buy you a decent, solid, well reviewed helmet with a branded, weather resistant jacket as well. Gloves, trousers/jeans would be budget and probably unbranded for the sort of cash you would have left over. I'm happy to recommend brands which would fit that price bracket, but others will likely disagree with my choice as they aren't Shoei or Arai quality. That doesn't mean they won't save your life, keep you dry or stop you from taking the skin off your arms - but they won't last very long and will likely need replacing before a year is out, given every day, all season/all weather use.",null,0,null,1428182079,null,0,1428182264,0,cq1apwk,null,t3_31g32u,null,t1_cq1apwk,null,t1_cq18fpu,null,null,null,1432197403,null,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null

Extremism is such an ambiguous term. If I said to you the Islamist movement is rooted in a political ideology, an anti-western sentiment born on our own actions - there would be many that would claim I have extremist views. Yet a historian could see that I am merely reciting fact.

All those incidents you've cited are not isolated - the are born off our own actions in these countries. 

[Islamic Revolution in Iran was because of a western backed military coup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution#Historical_background)

Wahabbism from Arabia is funded by oil money paid by western countries

Taliban and Al-Qaeda are symptomatic of the US's wars in Iraq (Gulf War included) - also read about the Skyes-Picot agreement and the fall of the Ottomon Empire. 

ISIS have been linked by numerous experts to our War on terror (including extremism experts I have interviewed)

&gt; They might turn it around, but there is no evidence to suggest they will, only goodwill.

We can stem the flow of extremism by directly addressing the issues that lead to it. This includes the injustices we have and continue to perpetuate abroad.

I ended up catching some reruns a few years later and I've been watching on and off for the last 7 or 8 years. 

The best part of the show is that everything always changes; you have great episodes followed by terrible ones, you have comedy followed by tragedy followed by horror, you have emotional stories, you have world building stories, you have different writers, you have different actors, you have different tones. 

It isn't the same sort of show as Buffy exactly (though they have credit Buffy with allowing them to revive the show) and it isn't trying to be. I will always prefer Buffy and Angel over this show but those shows have told their stories and ended (at least on-screen), Doctor Who on the other hand gets to keep bouncing along growing, changing, improving to some fans and falling apart to others. My suggestion is to keep watching and see how different things can get, definitely finish season 1 as a lot of season 1 is explaining the core concepts of the show before it gets to move on and do its own thing.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j3OMHBQmVkxc6dAQNKhj2aSxxJAjsgQ2KtXcgZsiBmQ/edit?usp=sharing

Average number of interventions/year between 2007-2010

286 / 3 = 95.3333333333

Average number of interventions/year between 2010-2014

(770 - 286) / 4 = 121

So the number of interventions has in fact increased, but that is not just because of a rise in Islamism, but also right wing extremism. 

Between 2007 to 2010, 67% of referrals was recorded as being Muslim; 26% was ‘not known’; and 7% was of ‘other religion’. 

Also, between September 2001 and the end of August 2012, there were only 241 convictions for terrorism related offences. That is about 20 convictions per year. 175 of those convicted were Muslim, the rest were of another or no religion. This is despite there being an equal number of terrorist related offences between those who identified as Muslim, and those who did not. Most people were sentenced to 2-5 years. 

To put that figure into context, there are 500-600 homicides in the UK a year. What is a larger threat to our well-being in your opinion?

I don't think that at all. Our nuclear deterrent might have its origins in a different world, but that doesn't mean we aren't a big part of the world we live in now. The UK is the worlds 7th or 8th largest economy by most measures, it possess the 10th largest city on the planet and one of only a handful of global cities - and is seen as the only rival to New York in its level of financial integration with the global economy. By 2050 our economy is predicted to be the largest in Europe. Our language is the 3rd most commonly spoken on the planet and the most commonly learnt second language. The modern global economy essentially has its foundations on the first nation to undergo industrialization - the United Kingdom. We are uniquely advantaged in the modern world because we had a hand in building it in an image that suits our culture and values. Elsewhere it is called an [Anglo-Saxon Economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_model).

Nuclear weapons are part of our national capability - not a vestige of our former military might, and people often conflate the two. Nuclear weapons do not make an armed force. They don't substitute an armed force. [Power projection](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/HMS_Queen_Elizabeth_in_Rosyth_Dockyard_MOD_45158230.jpg/1280px-HMS_Queen_Elizabeth_in_Rosyth_Dockyard_MOD_45158230.jpg) is a different thing entirely - and we do that too. The strategic nuclear deterrent is more than a weapons system - it's a statement of the nations global significance and speaks to our international credibility that we can possess such a device and exercise restraint with it. 

I don't think you really understand the strategic or conceptual nature of the nuclear deterrent and your assumptions are based on a false notion that it's simply a dying power clinging onto an antiquated weapons platform. Nuclear weapons are the single most important technology the United Kingdom possesses. They are the reason that for the last 70 years northern Europe has known peace for the longest duration since the days of antiquity. They are the reason why nation-states don't consume other nation-states and entire ethnic groups are eradicated on the whim of dictators. Nuclear weapons provide stability as a credible last line of defense.

There is strong evidence they work too... in the Falklands war it has been well documented that the Argentines looked after the local British population as they feared a nuclear reprisal against Buenos Aires if the British thought they were committing an act of genocide against the local population.

* You always need records of your sales and any financial transactions. This is just generally good practice anyway, but you don't want to be challenged on something and have no evidence to back yourself up. Even from a business perspective, you need records of your sales and receipts to prevent people from trying to rip you off. It does happen.

* You need to keep track of your finances generally. As a self employed person, you are your company. If you end up owing tax, the government makes no significant distinction between 'business money' and 'personal money'. Your business does not owe tax. You do. There are many legal and financial consequences of this arrangement, and you would do well to research the major differences between simply registering as a self-employed individual, and registering an LLC (Limited Liability Company). I have not registered an LLC, but I also have a full-time PAYE job in addition to my freelance work, and it's just easier for me to function normally this way. I believe most accountants would probably recommend you register as an LLC, although you should really get advice about this kind of thing from a professional.

* There is no such thing for you as 'money you make from your business'. Any money you make belongs to your business, and vice-versa - they are one and the same. The government does not generally care how you make money as a self-employed person (outside of illegal activities, obviously) - only that when you do receive income, you pay tax. As far as I'm aware (although I'm not a professional on these matters), you only need to track business-related purchases for the sake of claiming VAT back (although I'm sure there are other types of purchases which would require proof).

All of the above is just from my own experiences and what I've read. I'm not a legal expert and you should really seek legal and financial advice if you have concerns about these things. It's best to really understand what you're liable for and what you can do as a self-employed person.",null,0,null,1428183493,null,0,false,0,cq1bfpb,null,t3_31g2ct,null,t1_cq1bfpb,null,t3_31g2ct,null,null,null,1432197741,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The conservatives have a single seat in Scotland - its irrelevant whether they loose it. It won't make a difference to the end result. Labour stand to loose up to about 30 seats. It's a monumental difference - labour could lose more seats than the entire lib dem party will possess.

The Lib dems are only likely to return about 25 seats - far too few for the conservatives to form a coalition with again.

So realistically there are two choices; Labour, or Conservative. One or the other **IS** going to form the next government, whether you like it or not. It's in the numbers. If the conservatives win more seats, they will form the government. It's going to be very difficult for labour to form a supply and demand government against a party that polled a higher share of the vote. It could be incredibly damaging for labour if they do that in England. Their government will be perceived to lack legitimacy.

**Where did you purchase:** Rakuten JP, but it's no longer listed under direct shipping to the UK

**Product claims:** *""Comfortable light and non-sticky SPF 50+/PA++++ sunscreen with collagen, hyaluronic acid and 7 types of plant extracts for moisturisation.""*

**About you:** Combo dehydrated skin, prone to diet related break outs, sensitive to exfoliants, fair to medium skin tone that tans and doesn't burn.

**Your opinion:** I wasn't able to try this out for long as the orange oil used to fragrance it started to irritate my skin after about 2-3 days.

But like most physical sunscreens it does have a white cast though it's not exceptionally bad and will fade once it absorbs (or I just stopped noticing it). I did have problems around my hairline and eyebrows where it would leave white flakes.

It leaves a fairly natural finish depending on your skin condition, probably greasy feeling if you're combo to oily but it'll feel like you just moisturised with a facial oil for a bit. It also has a tendency to separate a bit in the tube so you'll squeeze out a bit and it'll be surrounded by a small pool of oil/liquid.

Unfortunately I think our two losses have less to do with our formation and more to do with our form, and the form of the teams we are playing against.  This is the time to step it up and make a run, as United and Arsenal are doing.  Last match, Stevie goes off is a fluke, today Arsenal was the best they've been in a long while, and those goals were impressive.  I honestly think that Allen is still the weakest link, despite many not admitting to it; Moreno, Markovic, and Can had bad matches, Coutinho has been very quiet.  It's not as simple as just throwing another man in the back as this post is implying.  The team has looked very fatigued, you can't expect us to win every match from January onward, and then face the toughest opponents toward the end of the season without some fatigue.  Additionally, I'm a bit offset and I'm sure some of the players are by BR continually sending mixed messages to players by putting them in different positions each match.  It's all good and well to put a player (like with Can) out of position and keep him there if he is excelling but this whole shit of putting players in a different position each match is idiocy.

null,false,MaesterWeasel,null,null,null,"Hmm, I think we couldn't take *the* Besiktas game like any premier league game because we were running out of fumes, we really were (and it really shows now how low on fuel we are). I think we had Henderson, Sakho, Lucas and Gerrard injured for that game and we rested Coutinho after he had started like every game in an almost 3 month period with two games every week. Besiktas just looked so much more fresh and energetic than us. We had such a weird combination of players on that field. It only could've gone well had we been efficient with our chances but we were the polar opposite and payed for that. Sturridge and Sterling put in some of the worst performances seen by our players this season. 

So, I think that game was just very unfortunate that we couldn't just finish one chance and then conceded a pretty great goal. 

In general, though, the performances in Europe were a bit lackluster and slow, almost low on energy(this season). Although, it's hard to tell if it was down to our form in general or the way we approached the games because we haven't been fast starters all season now. Basel away was pretty bad performance but so were every other game we played around that time. Ludogorets away was okay-ish but at that time we let everything in from set pieces and Mignolet also sucked one in - the two costed us the win. Real Madrid - well, I don't think we can criticise the team for not getting anything, they are on another level. We had a surprising team out in the away game, but seriously, the ""better players"" like Sterling, Coutinho and Gerrard weren't producing at that time, also. 

When we played in Europa League 2 seasons back it looked much more promising actually. The problem with competing was that Coutinho and Sturridge were cup-tied and these two were big part of the reason our form picked up that season. Suarez not finishing couple of 1v1 chances away @ Zenit cost us. Carragher gave away early goal in the second leg and we had to score 4 goals to proceed. Scored 3 and went out on away goals with Shelvey missing a golden chance to get the winner. I would say that was semi decent Euro-year considering we game lots of chances to youngsters and topped a pretty decent group. Of course, Europa League is a different stuff when compared to CL but still. I don't think Rodgers has been THAT bad. It's bit overblown after the failure in CL. But I think every Liverpool fan knows we couldn't string together two wins during the whole CL campaign. We just weren't good in general, it didn't have much to do with it being European cup.

edit: man, I need to write less and get to my point quicker. I just wanted to say that I don't think Rodgers has been as bad is Europe as many claim.

I think you're combining two different arguments there:

* The SNP will never vote for the renewal of Trident.
* If Labour/SNP did come to some formal arrangement then that arrangement wouldn't make the SNP support Trident.

That doesn't say that no arrangement would be reached unless Labour voted against Trident, it just says that any arrangement that is reached won't include the SNP voting for Trident.

AHHHH... not quite. It all banks on them actually making a deal. I doubt they will. Scots tend to look at this with total tunnel vision and come out with stuff like *""but they have too""*... they don't. Labour are going to win about 260 seats. The SNP are potentially going to win 35-50. The SNP are a tiny party. Ultimately it is up to labour who they form deals with. It all banks on the perception to labour that a deal with the SNP is in their interests - not just in the interest of getting in power, but the long term stability of the party. Now the party leadership will tend to be focused on power certainly, but the swathes of members they need to back them tend to be more cautious. Personally I don't think the SNP will be able to make any deal with them palatable... the damage it will do labour will offset any potential benefits.  

&gt; That deal is definitely going to happen, even if English voters weren't too happy about it

What on earth makes you think that? Labour *want* their ~30 scottish seats. They **NEED** their 260 English seats to exist. If they lose their English core vote then that's their party obliterated. 

&gt; Fixed parliament act means they would have 5 years to make the voters happy

Not really. Provided they (or someone else) can secure a majority in the commons then they can force a new election. Lets think about it in numbers... even if the SNP win 49 seats and Labour win a higher than predicted 280 then you're talking about 329 seats... only 3 seats ahead of a majority. All it will take is a defection or two, a death, some by-elections etc. and suddenly the government has lost its majority. The last time a party had such a weak margin it was challenged by a no confidence vote... the outcome of that vote put Baroness Thatcher into government for most of the next 2 decades.

&gt;Prior to his public self-outing, Bisi Alimi began his career in late 1990s in Nigeria when his friends were dying due to HIV/AIDS. After 2 years of doing community mobilization work and condom distribution among Gay men and Men who have Sex with other Men (MSM) in Nigeria, he joined the Alliance Rights Nigeria (ARN) in 2002 as a Program Director developing and providing HIV/AIDS and sexual health services and supports.

Did he really have no idea that he would get NHS treatment in the UK? Did it come as a complete surprise to him that he is being given treatment that saves his life? 

He seems a brave man and a doughty campaigner. I really don't know what I think about free HIV treatment for arrivals like him: it is probably a good idea.  

But I do not think he has been straightforward in this article, and he could be a bit more grateful for expensive NHS treatment that (in preventing him from developing AIDS) is saving his life.

Yes, I have. Several times. But thanks for the free history lesson!

&gt; The hard truth is come May 8th some 70% of British voters will have voted for one of two parties. The outcome of the election will be decided by them - and not by parties with 4% of the vote share. The SNP position is deceptively weak.

I don't think anyone's disputing the relative number of MPs returned by each country, or that the SNP's current prominence in UK politics is largely because FPTP elsewhere isn't producing a decisive majority for the main two.

But I think the aspect you're missing is that, in terms of Scottish politics, that's not all that significant.

What's significant is that the Conservative and Unionist party had a pretty solid lock on the vote in Scotland up until the 1950s, Labour became the default choice from the 1960s, and the SNP's current strategy is to ensure they become the normal choice for a good few decades. They appear to be succeeding at that beyond their wildest dreams.

I find that interesting primarily because I think it makes Scottish independence inevitable. rUK will get on just fine without Scotland, and may well have a two-party system forever, and if people in rUK are fine with that then that's great.

Maybe. Personally I'm more inclined to believe the narrative that says binding the economies of the major European powers together to make armed conflict an exercise in self-harm was much more significant. We don't point our nukes at France or Germany, nor does France point them at us.

&gt; They are the reason why nation-states don't consume other nation-states and entire ethnic groups are eradicated on the whim of dictators. Nuclear weapons provide stability as a credible last line of defense.

Let's keep things in perspective. The UK has around 160 functional warheads, which is a less than 1% of the 17,000 warheads in existence. We're not the linchpin of western civilisation any more.

&gt; There is strong evidence they work too... in the Falklands war it has been well documented that the Argentines looked after the local British population as they feared a nuclear reprisal against Buenos Aires if the British thought they were committing an act of genocide against the local population.

There were less than 2,000 people living in the Falklands in 1982. The idea that we would launch a nuclear strike on the 3,000,000 people living in Buenos Aires in response is utter fantasy.

It mostly seems to be so ofsted/council or whatever can ask the school ""why has 30% of the class not made 2 levels of progress"" and it's nothing to do with helping the child. It would be ok for the teacher to do a few tick boxes after observing each child e.g. yes knows numbers, can read level 1 books etc. so they know which children need the extra help and teachers have mostly been good at noticing which children need the extra help. It can put pressure on the children if they know about the test in advance and they hear their older siblings being worried about tests or their parents tell them they should be getting everything right. Also I think schools here suffer from too many tests which don't always benefit the pupils. There is a lot of teaching to pass the test instead of teaching to learn. I also hate the phonics test in the end of year 1 because phonics isn't the best method for every child. I started learning to read at 2 and by the time I started school I could pretty much read anything (I wouldn't understand a Charles Dickens book at 4, still could read the words) but I didn't learn phonics so I may have underperformed on the phonics test because of the made up words which the child pronounces correctly through phonics so that may mean I'd be labelled as an average/not strong reader despite being way above my age in reading.

* Partly down to a brief pre crisis spending binge in the Brown government (responsible for perhaps a third of the deficit). Which was mitigated by their very good record over the previous governments of reducing the total debt.

* Partly down to a global financial crash which was completely beyond the control of our government.

* Partly down to financial deregulation which did nothing to rein in excessive risk taking in British banks, and overexposure to dodgy assets, which was part of a political consensus amongst all major parties. In fact the Conservatives and the SNP were in favour of more deregulation, not less.

Series 1 is trying to do something very difficult, which is to explain decades of back history in a single season so as to get all of the new viewers caught up with the important facets of the show and it's past. This is a VERY difficult challenge, and it's probably the strongest thing about Series 1. One of the greatest strengths AND problems of Doctor Who is simply that so much has happened over the history of the show.  So far, the episodes have:

Rose:  Introduced the Doctor, the TARDIS, and an old villain. It shows well the chaos (from the companion's point of view) of traveling with this mysterious man.

The End of the World:  We travel to the future for the first time, and not just a few years, but the unbelievably distant future. We see some of the implications of this. We also learn that the Doctor is a Time Lord, and we learn the first details of the Time War (something new to Doctor Who, this is not part of it's past).

The Unquiet Dead: We travel to the past for the first time. We learn more about the Time War.

Aliens of London / World War III: We're introduced to the third major type of Dr. Who story... the invasion of modern Earth scenario. We're introduced to UNIT, which has a LONG history in the classic series. We also see the consequences of time travel for the first time on the people that his companions leave behind. 

Dalek: We're introduced to the Doctor's greatest enemies, and learn more about the Time War. (This episode is still considered a classic.)

Father's Day: We learn the implications of messing around with time when you don't know what you're doing. Paradoxes can be a serious problem in this show, as you can imagine.

As you can see, each episode is a piece of a puzzle that's getting filled in. When we get to Series 2, you'll see that the show really gets to expand and develop a lot more. Also... all of these puzzle pieces are leading to a genuinely good finale to the season. It's going to pay off in the end.

I do agree with you that Miliband knows this is his chance. However, there is a common misconception that a party leader has total control over their party. Miliband needs his grassroots members to back him or he's fucked whatever he does. Whilst his inner circle might want to back an SNP coalition, he won't want to do it if he thinks there will be a leadership challenge if he does. Miliband needs the backing of his party to remain in charge.

I don't make bets, but you can have the moral high ground if you are right and I will have it if I'm right. I do not think labour and the SNP will make a deal.

Arsenal similar to us, had neither the financial power, not the prestige to compete with Man CIty, Chelsea, Man U etc when building their stadium. So had to buy young players because 
a) All they could afford and 
b) All they could attract for their wage 
The youn/unknown players they bought were:
Nasri, Song, Sagna, Hleb,Clichy, Ramsey, Walcott etc 
What do most of these players have in common?
As soon as they became established they left. 
Meaning Arsene had to rebuild all over again and a vicious circle ensued.

Hoping we succeed in the future is  assuming
1)These young players actually become good 
2) These young players will want to stay 

Assumption 1 that is getting young players to become good is hard enough, ,there's no gurantee Markovic, Countinho will become world class
Assumption 2 is even more unrealistic, especially for foreign players. 

If Countinho becomes good as a Brazillian do you think he'll say no to Barca or Madrid? The same with Markovic. This is partially why Wenger who  has historically been subject to much banter for enver buying English kids all of sudden  has moved to buying an English core for his team, and more recently ex barca and ex real madrid. 
It's because it's harder for English players to move teams in the prmier league once they become established (Sterling being the exception lol) and CRUCIALLY the allure of real madrid is smaller for british players vs foreigners.

This is why unfortunately I have pessmistic outlook on Rodgers strategy. I don't blame him as well, any manager would struggle in such a scenario it's  why the top 4 largely is the same historically, and why getting last seasons transfers was so crucial.

No we don't. Most of our long-term migrants came here simply because they can. We have a points-based system for less than 25% of our total immigration. Even if it was 50%, that's not good enough. It should be 100%. EU immigration policy is inherently racist.

The problem with grammar schools is there isn't enough. The more there are, the less the coaching will be effective because they can't coach everyone. They should probably change the format of testing too so it's harder to coach for. But alas. 

But coaching isn't the be all and end all. I didn't even look at a practice paper for my entrance exams, other kids I know had 6 months intensive coaching. I later discovered I was in the top 10 in each of the entrance exams. The smartest kids will always get in, regardless of coaching or wealth. 

What we should be encouraging is poorer families to read to their kids and such. That's what develops the intelligence at a young age.

Doesn't matter whether it was likely or not. They **perceived** the threat to be real, and they weren't' willing to find out whether they were right or wrong. That's the principle of deterrence...

That's where you don't seem to be able to get your head around the strategic deterrent. It isn't about the act of doing it... if you have to kill 3 million people in cold blood to avenge the death of 2,000 then the system has already failed. It's value isn't in retribution, it's value is in deterrence. The point of it is to stop the situation deteriorating to begin with... and counter-intuitively they seem to work, because when it boils down to it, nobody really wants to have the flesh vaporised right off their body in an inferno of death and destruction that wipes out their culture and people.

&gt;  The UK has around 160 functional warheads, which is a less than 1% of the 17,000 warheads in existence. We're not the linchpin of western civilisation any more.

Here are the [84 largest cities in the world by population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population). They make up 609,144,073 people. So using just half of the UK's warheads it would be possible to instantly eradicate about 1/6th of the human population... not to mention those that would go on to die from residual fallout. Essentially the UK has enough warheads to reduce humanity to a shadow of its former self and to obliterate the surface of the planet.

Now imagine just one single warhead landing on a city like London. The fallout drifting across the country with the wind, the loss of our capital, our economy, 10 million of our population instantly dead and millions more over the coming weeks, months and years... it would be the end of the British. The death of our culture, our people and our country. That's the credibility of the threat...

The reason we don't have 7000 warheads is because we don't **need** them to maintain a credible deterrent. The US and Russia both have large stockpiles because in part they retain a saturation capability (i.e. the ability to launch far more weapons than are needed to guarantee a successful hit) - this was part of their ""credible"" threat back in a day before advanced missile technology.

Do they still want a 5 year ban on any new migrants for example, as Farage said last year?

Does he really think that rooting out foreign aids sufferers is an election winning policy?..

Does he still think the British born children of immigrants should be classified as migrants? And if so why?

I'm not completely opposed to a points based immigration system (provided it is bolstered by an extremely competent, humane assylum seeker admittance policy) but I believe this to be the acceptable face of unpleasant ideas.

The toughest thing about UKIP is that they haven't published an actual manifesto of their policies - it makes them very hard to criticise. Whatever you criticise them for, they can deny that it's their ""official"" stance on the subject and move on.

Whether you consider them racist or not is controversial - the facts are that they are strongly anti-immigration and anti-eu - which attracts a lot of racist supporters. They also have plenty of members/candidates who have said some incredibly bigoted and racist things (from ""gay marriage causes bad weather"" to ""i just don't like black people"").

Paul Nuttall and Nigel Farage, two of the higher-ups in UKIP have expressed a desire to change the NHS for a more US-style insurance based system - although the party denies that this is official policy.

What do they want? If I had to guess they want a Thatcherite right-libertarian style, socially conservative government. With the UK withdrawing from Europe, and immigration capped and moved to a harsher points-based system than the one we have now. I personally get the impression that they want to remove a lot of social services, lower taxes, and provide extra tax incentives for large companies and high-earners.

It's kind of hard to claim they're not racist anymore though, now they're saying quite clearly they want to remove the laws preventing racial discrimination.

They want to make it LEGAL to discriminate based on race, religion, gender and sexuality. That seems racist to me.",null,0,null,1428189879,null,0,false,0,cq1eqlp,null,t3_31gfls,null,t1_cq1eqlp,null,t3_31gfls,null,null,null,1432199297,null,38,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,38,null

I think it might go the other way, given a loose,  tacit or even vote by vote coalition between labour, the snp and another party(s) there could be a series of votes about policy etc that they will be able to pick and choose what they approve and therefore look out for the interests of their constituency, the Ulster unionists would probably be able to do the same in a tory led coalition. They've shown no tendency to 'lib dem' themselves and hold little loyalty to Britain as a whole, I think this could work in their favour.

From year 7 onwards, I attended a boys grammar school, which means the school selected students following the ""eleven-plus"" examinations at age 11. The school was divided into six ""houses"" for daily registration, with lessons being a mixture of students from all houses.

I continued on into the sixth form at the same school to study for my A-Levels, following my GCSE examinations. Indeed, the vast majority of boys (probably 80-90%) carried straight on into the sixth form- it was essentially a continuation of your education, and the assumption was that most would do so. Only those who had been seriously struggling with their studies would be refused.

Although it was a boys grammar school, it had a mixed sixth form, with about a dozen girls joining the school in my year. It was a bit of a weird time- for a lot of the boys, they'd had no prior association with girls of any kind, and I can't believe it was a particularly welcoming environment for the girls.

As sixth formers, we had a dedicated common room, which was a decent size, where we were able to spend our free periods, breaks and lunches. Our school day was divided into eight periods of 40-50 minutes, and on an average day, two of these would be free periods. Our day would be broken up as follows:

&gt; Morning Registration

&gt; Period 1

&gt; Period 2

&gt; Morning Break

&gt; Period 3

&gt; Period 4

&gt; Period 5

&gt; Period 6

&gt; Lunch Break

&gt; Afternoon Registration

&gt; Period 7

&gt; Period 8

If the two free periods occurred at the end of the school day (after lunch), we were permitted to leave the school site early- otherwise, we had to stay on site at all times. In earlier school years, single-period lessons were more common, but as we studied fewer subjects in the sixth form (we each took four A-levels plus whatever other odd subjects had to be done, such as RE, PE and General Studies), most lessons would be double periods, so there'd be less moving around.

In these free periods and at breaks/lunch, people would generally just hang out and chat, get work done or play games. My own group of friends formed something of a card pool, playing poker, euchre and canasta at pretty much every opportunity- at one point, we'd worked our way up to 32-man tournaments. The teachers didn't really approve, but as we didn't play for money, they generally turned a blind eye.

Our school had a compulsory uniform all the way through, which changed slightly for the sixth form, with a different tie. Prefects- elected teachers' assistants who would get responsibilities- would also wear strips of ribbon over their pocket the colour of their house- for example, my house colour was green.

Outside of school, it wasn't unusual for people to find part-time work, although there are laws governing how many hours can be worked by someone in full-time education. I worked for an hour immediately after school every day as a lab assistant (which sounds fancier than it was), while friends of mine worked in shops, restaurants and supermarkets. In my experience since then, this doesn't seem to have changed- I now work with several sixth form students who are part time.

As for socially... most people were already going out drinking and clubbing from around 15-16. It certainly wasn't unusual for people to try it on with fake IDs, and there were plenty of places locally that weren't all that strict about checking. Indeed, my own first job at the age of 14 paid me in Bacardi Breezers, rather than money, which was perfectly fine by me at that age. The trend does seem to have moved to pre-drinking now, with people buying alcohol from supermarkets and drinking it at home before going out- I can see how that could be both cheaper and easier for underage people to get away with.",null,0,null,1428190614,null,0,false,0,cq1f4c4,null,t3_31gm64,null,t1_cq1f4c4,null,t3_31gm64,null,null,null,1432199477,null,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5,null

Testing is one way to do this, and children will come into school with different ability and will be largely separated into groups that can quite easily effect their education for many years to come, almost entirely randomly. 

Speaking from personal experience I was put in the lowest group at primary school for the first 4 years, to the point where I still don't know what a verb, noun or adjective is, because I was never taught, why was I in the this group, because I was one of the younger people in the class, no actual reason, I now have a Masters degree.  

Without proper assessment standards you end up with teachers, who really are in no way qualified to assess academic ability choosing children's fate, just because how they perceive them, and lets put it this way, studies show that more attractive people are thought to be cleverer, and more disruptive students thought to be stupider, irrelevant of if it is the case. Having some kind of test to not only test the students fairly, but also test the teaching competence to make sure children are getting a good education is necessary. 

There is of course other issues, like education being more fluid at these levels, but overall children should learn certain things and should be able to show they know them because otherwise they are going to struggle at higher levels if they don't. Even more so when they first start at school, this gives a base line of where you need to start teaching them from.

&gt; Swiss banking giant UBS is to open a technology lab in London to explore how blockchain technology can be used in financial services.

&gt; The lab, set to open this month and occupy a dozen desks at Canary Wharf-based fintech accelerator space Level39 - a hub in London for financial technology startups- will bring together technology experts from the bank and the wider fintech community, UBS said.

&gt; Barclays runs a fintech incubator in London and New York and most of the major banks participate in a fintech accelerator program run by Accenture globally, while a number of lenders, including Lloyds Banking Group , back London-based Startupbootcamp FinTech.

Or maybe they will, I don't really know, but either way I don't think it would be a surprise to anyone.

I look at it like this- a couple of months before Kenny was let go, were people on here crying out for Rodgers, who then had a total of 3/4 of a year of PL experience and not a whole lot below that really?  I really don't think they were.  Not sure why anyone thinks it needs to be an established, likely expensive manager like Klopp or Simeone to offer an improvement on Rodgers really.  By far his longest management tenure has been with us and he's never won anything really, it's not like he has some sort of stellar CV.

I disagree entirely. Muslims are demonised and given fairly harsh treatment in the press and by society as a whole. Of course that doesn't mean Muslims should be on the first train to Syria/Isis heartlands, but the original point has merit. I think it makes it a whole lot easier to radicalise young muslims when they at least feel they're being rejected by British society.

We also had a common room where you could sit with friends and chill, it had pool tables, x-box, Wii, football table and a basic kitchen, cafeteria next door for food whenever you want and a shop selling magazines, notebooks, pens etc. and snacks. If your break was only an hr you'd go to common room if its 2+ you'd normally go there for a bit or walk 15 mins into town to wander, do some shopping, get food. Its a bit like uni, you got times to go to lessons but rest of the time you get to do what you want. 

Also its more informal than school. You call teachers by first names and if you're given homework but don't do it then they don't care, you don't get in trouble, its more like whatever your lose. But school work is equivalent to US 1st/2nd yr kind of work. 

We balanced it just like you in US do some nights you do college work, some nights you go out with mates and sometimes you have work. Normally jobs for college kids is evening or mainly weekend work and then you just go out with friends after work. There's a lot more drinking involved, my college would organise nights out in local nightclub and everyone would pre-drink, go there, dance, get with each other, kicked out at 12-1am and stagger home.

The Eleventh Hour introduces a new Doctor and a new showrunner.  It was written for the purpose of segueing the show into a new era, and on top of that it's a decent episode.  For those reasons, I think it works as a perfectly fine introductory episode.

It's kind of like how a lot of people suggest starting the classics with Spearhead From Space rather than An Unearthly Child.  Sure there are some great serials that you will miss if you follow that advice, but some people consider the loss to be worth it.  Spearhead follows a much more modern approach to television and is frankly a lot easier for someone unused to really old Doctor Who to follow and enjoy.

In the new series, we haven't seen the show change quite that much, but it has certainly changed.  A lot of OP's issues with the show had been solved or otherwise worked out by the time The Eleventh Hour aired.  That being said, skipping the RTD Era seems like a perfectly legitimate suggestion.

And don't think that skipping the RTD Era right off the bat means skipping it forever.  Almost all Doctor Who fans do inevitably go back and watch old episodes that they've never seen before.  Curiosity and Who-Withdrawal are very powerful forces.

Whether I would personally encourage skipping RTD is a different story, and an irrelevant one.

null,false,chimpyang,null,null,null,"Ok, I read the article and the primary source that it contains - the Public Health England (PHE) publication, and I think that its mostly just crap interpretation of the available numbers.  And I'm going to pick at it for sleight of hand usage of language and inaccuracies.

ART = antiretroviral therapy

1. The PHE publication does not mention nationality of those involved.  This is important, because in the argument of whether British nationals should be treated ahead of Foreign nationals, ethnicity does not accurately portray nationality.  It isn't really a proxy number unless you know the % of people of black african status who hold British nationality - and in such a case, you are still guessing - since you are extrapolating.

2. Not every HIV Patient receives ART - this can be due to 2 reasons:
 a) Being undiagnosed - overall % diagnosis of cases is something that we should strive to be better at.  The PHE report puts out figures out of 38% (heterosexual men) and 31% (heterosexual women) of the estimated number of black-african HIV positive people being undiagnosed.  This is in contrast to the overall undiagnosed percentages of 34% (heterosexual men) and 29% (heterosexual women)

b) Not fitting the criteria for ART.  The British HIV Association guidelines - which are also our NICE guidelines for HIV treatment - recommend treatment for patients that fall into the following criteria:

&gt; Treatment of primary HIV infection
&gt; 4.3       We recommend patients presenting with primary HIV infection (PHI) and meeting any one of thefollowing criteria start ART:
&gt; 
&gt; * Neurological involvement
&gt; 
&gt; * Any AIDS-defining illness
&gt; 
&gt; * Confirmed CD4 cell count&lt;350 cells/mL - (trials are underway to test whether we should raise the threshold. - my addition)
&gt; 
This can be found on p12 of this document [BHIVA guidelines](http://www.bhiva.org/documents/Guidelines/Treatment/2012/hiv1029_2.pdf)


**Points 1 and 2 mean that you can't just simply multiply £59,300 with £20,000 and then spout that off as an accurate value of the cost of treating non-British nationals for HIV.** - which is where this £1.2 billion number comes from.

The answer is, we probably don't know, or the data isn't readily available to calculate how much.  And whether there is or isn't legs in the resource costs of treatment of non-British nationals on the NHS - messing with the argument using HIV is just plain bad debating.

Treating HIV properly is important.  Improperly or partially treated infections can lead to resistnce to the drugs we have available.  Like many other viruses - HIV swaps its genetics with other strains that it comes into contact with, and emergence of drug resistant HIV as de novo infection rather than as a consequence of long term ART would be a disaster for the UK - we would have to roll out more expansive regimes that will push the price of treatment yet higher (unless some blockbuster drug comes along - which is also likely to have an eye watering cost attached to it).

It is in our interests to treat any occurrences properly and also to encourage those who are undiagnosed to be tested and started on treatment.  Lowering viral loads leads to lower rates of infection, and to best protect the British people - it's to make sure people get properly treated where possible.  From a cost point of view, the BHIV guidelines linked to this study from Switzeland - done on an otherwise unselected group of HIV positive patients - which concluded:

&gt; HAART increases expected survival and health care costs. However, when productivity gains are included, society will probably save costs or pay a low price for substantial health benefits. The study provides strong arguments, from a societal perspective, to continue the current policy of providing unrestricted access to HAART in Switzerland.

Now, this doesn't mean that the same situation is true in the UK today - something that the BHIV guideline readily admits.  But I think this shows that of all the illness to highlight the political point, HIV is a pretty poor one.

I'm with Giffgaff at the mo, who use O2, who have just been bought up by 3, i think. Rolling contract and just buying handsets offline is the way to go. BTMobile 20gb data package for £25 is pretty appealing though. But in efforts to avoid bullshit contracts, I've gruellingly trained myself to just make do with 2gb/month and otherwise use wifi as much as possible.

we're all getting screwed though. profit margins on many of these services is through the roof. services like whatsapp etc have managed to stem their tyranny over messaging. so data caps and data fees are their last bastion for exorbitant charges. i've been with them all, if you run into problems, customer service is pretty shite with all the big companies. O2 we're relatively good for a long time, in that they were more UK based and had some decent online tools, but they were the most expensive too by far. real world performance of data service is usually pretty poor too in my experience, unless you are in a very urbanised location and avoiding the usual heavy congestion during the wee small hours, which is pretty pointless for a mobile data connection.

edit: just checked bt mobile t&amp;c's, they don't allow tethering, so 20gb data usage without it is pretty pointless for most people. fixed usage especially should not have limits on it, why the fuck does the isp care if i use my 20gb on my phone or through my pc, answer being they want to make it as inconvenient as possible for you to use your allowance, which you already pay through the nose for.

null,false,AimHere,null,null,null,"&gt;there is therefore no way that the Soviet unions - if we pretend that they really were acting of their own volition - could have got the money to the NUM without sanction from and the tacit approval of the Politburo. Come on, think about it!

Well *of course* the Soviet government didn't stop the funds getting through to the miners. *Of course* they approved. I'm sure they likely bent the rules to get the money through. What makes you think I would have said otherwise?

While we're on the subject, *of course* the Soviet miners raised the funds themselves. *Think about it*. In the 1980s, Soviet Russia was a vast industrial country, whose inhabitants had one of the top two largest Communist parties in the world, and who received more or less all their news from communist-controlled sources. 

We're talking about a *lot* of working-class miners, and a lot of *communist* miners at that. They wouldn't need to be forced or coerced into having a whip-round for striking miners, any more than the people of Hackney or Glasgow needed to be coerced by Thatcher's government into raising funds for miner's families. 

And as for the notion that this is an attack on democracy - the strike was being planned by the Conservative Party as early as 1978, before they were even in power. They hadn't quite settled on which industry at that time, but they were plotting on singling out one nationalised industry and beating the union in a strike. Hardly the actions of a helpless victim of foreign subversion. It was a domestic squabble between a right-wing union-bashing government and a union wielding a whole bunch of political power

The whole notion that the miner's strike was some form of foreign subversion is just a dopey propaganda line for saps and the government knew it. I gave you two instances of the security services all but admitting that they couldn't find anything at all to link the most watched man in free world with foreign subversion, and how the cops were forced to concede that the union weren't actually subversive by their rules (and therefore they needed a new police unit to spy on them). 

And Soviet subversion was no real threat to the UK, and the security services knew it. If they were really worried about Soviet influence, they could have killed the British communist party stone dead in 1956 or 1968 or 1980 by just publishing the documents they had about the money trail between the Soviets and the party at a time when everybody had turned against the Soviet Union due to some invasion or other. Instead, they used those documents as a way of briefing friendly journalists on non-attributable-'we-won't-prove-this,-but-here's-the gossip'-terms to journalists who were grateful for the titbits, and could then be used as information/disinformation conduits for the services. If Soviet subversion was ever a serious threat, why didn't MI5 just do the obvious thing to stop it, and discredit the communist party, and every single party member to boot? 

My answer is that they obviously preferred the Soviet threat the way it was, because it gave them a ready-made excuse for doing things like spying on domestic groups that *weren't* Soviet fronts, like the NUM, or Trotskyite groups or whatever. What's yours?

THEY ARE NOT ALL BORN EQUAL! 

I've had cheap ones and expensive ones. The main difference is the quality of the seal and the clarity of the inert. 

The worst one I had, let noticeably less light through and caused a slight distortion, which was manageable but I think it gave me headaches. 

The better ones held the seal more consistently. I still always take them out every 2 weeks to clean them and I add a little tiny bit of silicone gel to help the seal stay at its best. 

My latest Shoei takes the most effort to keep working well. Which is frustrating because it was flipping expensive. The pinlock insert is massive though! It covers almost the entire visor unlike most standard sized ones, so the field of vision is much better. 

The downside being that the seal doesn't hold as well and I tend to get a dogged patch down at the left, near the lip used to open the visor. Still, the extra visibility is a good trade off.

&gt;A NEW petition calling for a fatal accident inquiry into the mysterious death of SNP activist and campaigner Willie McRae has attracted more than 1,000 signatures a day.
&gt;
&gt;Five days after campaigners set up the petition, 6,500 signatures out of a target of 7,000 had been collected calling on the Crown Office to consider holding an FAI into the death of the lawyer on April 6 1985.
&gt;
&gt;His death was officially ruled as suicide but some believe he was murdered and there were claims by campaigners of involvement by state security services.
&gt;
&gt;The online petition launched ahead of the 30th anniversary of Mr McRae's death urges Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland to instigate an FAI and a campaign spokesman said the number of signatures so far showed the level of public support.
&gt;
&gt;Mark MacNicol, the campaign spokesman, said the group would meet to discuss how many signatures they should stop at before presenting the petition to the Crown Office given so many had been collected in less than a week.
&gt;
&gt;Mr MacNicol said: ""One of the key elements of FAI legislation is whether there is serious public concern.""
&gt;
&gt;After leaving Glasgow to drive to his holiday home in Dornie, Mr McRae was found badly injured in his crashed car on a remote spot in Wester Ross and he died the next day. Medical staff found a gunshot wound behind his right ear and police later recovered a weapon.
&gt;
&gt;The petition launched on campaigning website 38degrees.org.uk states there are sufficient questions to warrant a ""long overdue FAI"".
&gt;
&gt;Mr MacNicol said there were a number of serious allegations that require thorough investigation, including that Mr McRae, who was a well-known anti-nuclear campaigner, was under ""highly aggressive"" surveillance by Special Branch, which has led to an inquiry being ""avoided by multiple Lord Advocates since 1985"".
&gt;
&gt;The petition states: ""One thing we are all in agreement with, however, is that there are sufficient unanswered questions to warrant a long overdue FAI.
&gt;
&gt;""In addition to the highly suspicious circumstances surrounding his death there are also a number of serious allegations that require thorough investigation, but which, to date, have been ignored, including the statements of two police officers, now retired, with direct knowledge of events surrounding Willie's death.
&gt;
&gt;""Had Willie died at his place of work, while under arrest, or in prison, a Fatal Accident Inquiry would have been mandatory.
&gt;
&gt;""Not holding an inquiry under these circumstances makes a mockery of the Scottish judiciary. ""
&gt;
&gt;It adds: ""The Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976 requires that an inquiry be launched if the death is: sudden; suspicious; unexplained; or gives rise to serious public concern.
&gt;
&gt;The petition also outlines concerns which have been raised about other aspects of the controversial case. They include the fact that the gun with which Mr McRae was said to have shot himself was found a distance away from his vehicle, according to one of the first witnesses on the scene.
&gt;
&gt;It is also said Mr McRae left Glasgow with briefcases which were missing from the car when he was found.
&gt;
&gt;Mr MacNichol also said the campaigners would investigate separate action such as judicial review if the petition was rejected by the Lord Advocate.
&gt;
&gt;A spokesman for the Crown Office said: ""Crown Counsel are satisfied with the extensive investigations into the death of William McRae and have instructed that an FAI will not be held into the circumstances of Mr McRae's death.""

My lessons are spread out randomly e.g. Monday starts at 9am (classics) then I have a massive free period (usually spent in the library revising, hanging with friends or going out to eat) then I have lesson (sociology then business) until 4:30pm. However, on a Friday my first lesson starts at 11:30 (glorious sleep-in) and finishes at 2:30.Spending free time with friends is usually going up the high road to get lunch then going back to college and eating in the social area.

I also have a part time job but it's only 6 hours a week so it doesn't really take up much time and I usually do my homework during free periods so I don't have to do it at home. Though my sociology and classics teachers usually send me emails of ""further reading"" like university articles on certain subjects. A-level teachers will usually wax poetic about how **you'll only achieve an A/A* if you do your further reading** so I sometimes muster up the energy to do some further reading but it is hard.

In terms of differences between Sixth forms and colleges, I don't have personal experience in both but my secondary school had a sixth form and the main reason why I didn't apply to it was colleges tend to be focused on 16-18 year olds only (because they are usually only the last 2 years of education) so offer a greater variety of support when it comes to the next step (i.e. uni, apprenticeship, gap year) whereas sixth forms are attached to secondary schools (and even primary schools like the one I went to) so aren't very focused on sixth formers but the whole age group so I find the help offered is less useful.

Lastly, my knowledge of American high school is limited to films/tv and I've been informed that it is incorrect but from my experience, British schools don't have ""cliques"" and the popular people aren't the sporty/cheerleader type. Sports aren't a big part of British education culture and the ""popular"" (I'm not sure whether to even use this term because there was hardly a hierarchy of popularity, just the more social and dare I say scandalous? group that were the centre of attention most of the time) people were the stoners/emo's rather than the pretty/handsome people.

Also, Guido's figures are, as ever, misleading - at least to my bleary eyes. The report that they've quoted makes little mention of 'people who have come here from Africa.' What they mention is black-African ethnicity. You, your parents and your grandparents could have been born and raised in this country and you could still have black-African ethnicity.

I've also no idea where they got the 59,300 figure from. The closest I could get was 59,500 for the total estimated number of heterosexual people living with HIV, treated or untreated. If I've missed their source, please feel free to correct me.

The only place that mentions country of birth is the part about new diagnoses. It states this:

&gt; Data on country of birth was available for 83% of people newly diagnosed with HIV. The proportion of new HIV diagnoses reported among people born in Africa halved from 54% (3,460/6,420) in 2004 to 25% (1,240/4,980) in 2013. This has resulted in an increase in the proportion of new diagnoses reported among people born in the UK (from 32% (2,040/6,420) to 46% (2,220/4,980)) over the same period.

Separate to Farage, I think the fact is that non British nationals with HIV cause some effect on our public spending with respects to their health, but to a level that is not publically available or quantifiable, nor balanced against the possible implications of undertreating or undeclared illness.  I agree that this should be considered, and that there are many other issues that we are thinking about when we think about the pros and cons that immigration has brought to the UK.

Simply adding/subtracting will not help our squad.

The trouble with our squad is that we simply do not play *together*. We simply cannot hope/expect to throw a bunch of new players together and then expect them to work together and move together as one. Right now, our squad lacks leadership, is far too young and inexperienced and too raw. But we do not lack individual talent and we do not lack potential leaders.

I don't think we'll do anything significant in the summer but I don't necessarily think that is a bad thing.

* Scoring has been an issue but I think Liverpool will count on a healthy Sturridge, the arrival of Origi and the evolution of Henderson, Sterling, Coutinho, etc. to provide the goals.
* I'm sure we'll get a new keeper.

And aside from other little moves here and there to add depth, I think that'll be it.

I'm sure many will complain over the summer about how we have done nothing but I don't really think we have to do *that* much.

A lot, of course, rests on the shoulders of Brendan Rodgers. I think the 2nd place finish last season gave him a much longer leash (coupled with the understanding that we never really had Daniel Sturridge this season) *this* season. But it's **next** season where it will be make-or-break for Rodgers because it's up to him to finally bring the all these individual pieces together a create a team.

*From Wikipedia:
In 1996, the BBC applied for a trademark to use the blue police box design in merchandising associated with Doctor Who. In 1998, the Metropolitan Police filed an objection to the trademark claim, maintaining that they owned the rights to the police box image. In 2002 the Patent Office ruled in favour of the BBC, arguing out that there was no evidence that the Metropolitan Police—or any other police force—had ever registered the image as a trademark. In addition, the BBC had been selling merchandise based on the image for over three decades without complaint by the police.*",null,0,null,1428200855,null,0,false,0,cq1kaci,null,t3_31hci4,null,t1_cq1kaci,null,t3_31hci4,null,null,null,1432201982,null,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2,null

-From outside the EU - % of UK pop is 3.8%

Now, the stats are not directly correlated, depending on how you split the non-EU european countries.  But our demographics are fairly close to Switzeland's on non-European immigrants and much less on European immigrants.

null,false,AluminumFalcon3,lfc12,,null,"Some ideas on how we've been playing. Just gonna ramble on really.

Our switch in formation allowed us to take advantage of the talent we had. Can helping with distribution at the back, Skrtel as more of a sweeper, attacking players as wingbacks pushing back the opposition, hardworking midfielders who cover out wide and drop deep (Coutinho and Lallana) or cover the center (Henderson, Allen, Lucas) but can still create going forward (more Hendo and Coutinho than say Lucas). Fluid interchanges up front with Sterling, geared toward pressing with a front 3. We could create many overloads on the pitch.

Its biggest drawbacks were thin numbers in midfield and defense in wide areas. We could press with a midfield pivot and control the midfield as we showed against City, though some space did remain for players who got behind the midfield. Still at least we had 3 covering centrally at back. Plus this system meant that if the pivot had the job of shuttling out wide to cover for the wingbacks in transitions if necessary. The wingbacks need to push up, that's their job because it keeps the opposition fullbacks busy. But they need to be good outlets of possession and involved in play, which requires good distribution. But the central midfield pivot has to be judicious with pushing forward in attack, as there isn't a spare player like you would have in a single pivot. 

This set up with our relatively healthy squad pulled out a lot of strong victories, as well as grinding a ugly ones. But as our personnel changes so to do our strengths and weaknesses. Can is a much better distributor of the ball than he is a player to pin back a fullback. We lose pace down right and our distribution from out back is a lot more down to how good a game our centerbacks can play. Skrtel, who's distribution has not only improved and who also helps cover leftover space, is out. The loss of Lucas meant a change in the midfield dynamic, with (I think) defensive responsibilities split more between Hendo and Allen, resulting in less solidity at back. We see a lot more vulnerability out wide, partially because out of form wingbacks are black holes in possession, but also because our midfield is unable to compensate in the transition to cover. I think Rodgers tried to implement a 3 man midfield to cover that today and match Arsenal in the center, but it just didn't seem to work. Time and time again we were unable to distribute, lost possession, and Arsenal's passing exploited space out wide, dragging centerbacks around. Meanwhile we lacked a strong sweeper in Skrtel to take command and push Arsenal's line back. I think the defense today did not push up enough. 

3 at back shouldn't be tossed to the wayside completely. With the right personnel it can cause problems. But for a system that was brought in for pragmatic reasons, there's very little pragmatism I can see left. Without Skrtel, without Can, without more intensity in midfield, without productive wingbacks, we lose a lot more. 

But I have no idea what Rodgers is thinking or what he will (or should) do next. My intuition is we will lose the spare man at back and put it back in the midfield, but who knows. That's part of the excitement for me tbh, I think Rodgers is smart enough to surprise us.

null,false,TheColinous,green,Scottish Green post-socialist,null,"&gt; PATRICK Harvie hasn't a hope in hell of winning a seat on May 7 and he knows it.

&gt; South of the Border, the Greens not only plan to hold Brighton Pavilion, but gain Norwich South and Bristol West from the LibDems, and possibly pick up a few more seats on the way.

&gt; But in Scotland, where they came sixth overall behind Ukip in the 2010 election and lost their deposit in 19 of the 20 places they stood, no such breakthrough beckons.

&gt; In keeping with the reputation he gained during the referendum as a straight-talker, the co-convener of the Scottish Greens doesn't bother to pretend otherwise.

&gt; ""We'll make our best effort,"" he says drily on a break from leafleting in Glasgow.

&gt; ""Obviously, we're never going to say never, but we do know that first-past-the-post is a broken system. There's a genuine multi-party democracy in this country that's struggling to assert itself under the weight of an electoral system that tries to forces people to choose between two guys walking into Number 10.""

&gt; However that doesn't mean this election is a waste of time for the Scottish Greens - far from it.

&gt; Since the referendum, the party has more than quadrupled in size to 8700 members, more than 1000 of them (like Harvie in his fresher year at Manchester Metropolitan) ex Labour members.

&gt; Those activists need to stay fighting fit, so Harvie is using the coming weeks as a campaign camp, training them for the real battle he has in mind, the next Holyrood election.

&gt; ""We're going to have the capacity to reach people on the ground, door-to-door, street-by-street level that we've not had in the past.

&gt; ""I think that's one of the reasons why good polling numbers have not always translated into Xs on pieces of paper come election day.

&gt; ""We've got that now. We're going to have a campaign machine and the resources to run it.""

&gt; Between now and election day, the Scottish Greens' 31 Westminster candidates, many of them also gunning for Holyrood, will go through their paces too.

&gt; While the electorate can sample key Green messages: a £10 minimum wage, public services in public hands, including renationalisation of the railways, and more power for local communities.

&gt; Looking ahead, Harvie reckons the party can win one MSP in each of the eight regional lists for Holyrood, and perhaps two in the Lothians.

&gt; If that happened, it would see the respected land campaigner Andy Wightman become a Green MSP. ""He'd be a terrific addition,"" says Harvie.

&gt; With Labour appearing, as he puts it, ""bewildered"" and ""fatalistic"", and in no kind of shape for a 2016 win, a big haul of Green MSPs could give Harvie's party unprecedented clout.

&gt; ""We now have a strategic opportunity in the Scottish political landscape,"" he says.

&gt; ""I think even people who are fans of the SNP, a lot of them will be uneasy about the idea of swapping Labour hegemony for SNP hegemony, and they will want someone who can be constructive and challenging, and I think the Greens have an important role there.""

&gt; It sounds like he's pitching his party as the economic and environmental conscience of a future SNP government, just as the SNP is currently touting itself as the conscience of a future Labour government at Westminster.

&gt; Would he consider coalition with the Nationalists if they fail to win a second majority and the numbers allow it?

&gt; ""There's nothing objectively wrong with coalitions,"" he says, although he notes the Tory-LibDem one has been awful in practice.

&gt; ""If you can do it honestly, if you can find genuine common ground, and put forward a programme for government that is not just in the interest of the country but consistent with what you were saying to voters for your reasons for standing, if that can be done, then it's conceivable.""

&gt; The recent change of First Minister would certainly help such an alliance.

&gt; While he can hardly bear to discuss Alex Salmond - ""My Mum always told me that if you can't find something positive to say you shouldn't say anything"" - he calls Sturgeon ""a very inspiring politician"" who has already delivered positive change, such as the moratorium on fracking.

&gt; ""I've never pretended to be a massive fan of Alex Salmond in terms of his policies or personal style, but that doesn't mean I can't work constructively on common ground.

&gt; ""The fact that it's easier [with Sturgeon] on a personal level doesn't mean that it's necessarily easier at a policy level.

&gt; ""If the SNP continue to move in a progressive direction then I will welcome that and I'll give them credit where it's due. But if they continue to want to shore up the fossil fuel industry then I'll continue to challenge that.""

&gt; One obvious overlap with the SNP is a desire for independence.

&gt; A former member of the Yes Scotland board, Harvie has considerable experience of running a referendum campaign, and firm ideas on how not to run the next one.

&gt; For instance, he would also avoid another encyclopaedic White Paper, as it contained too many things for people to dislike, and gave the impression folk were voting for an SNP manifesto ""rather than the first step of a journey"".

&gt; Salmond's plan to share Sterling with the UK would also need to be junked.

&gt; ""When the question arises again, that kind of half-way house is not going to cut it.""

&gt; But before we rush ahead of ourselves, there's still the general election to get through, and a lot of conspicuously uncosted policies to sell voters.

&gt; Like replacing benefits with a universal citizens income of £100 a week for every working age adult and pensioner, and printing electronic money to invest in infrastructure.

&gt; Nor are there any projections in the Scottish Green manifesto for how much they would borrow, or raise through new taxes on wealth, land and financial transactions.

&gt; Surely they could have at least attempted to sketch out a balance sheet?

&gt; ""I accept it as a criticism,"" he says without seeming too fussed by it.

&gt; ""My instinct is to shy away from the retail politics. Choice in an election is not like the choice between mobile phone tariffs. This is a choice of ideas, about values, about the kind of society that we want to live in. That's what the Green party is always going to be more focused on.""

&gt; But that's just a cop-out because you can't do the maths, isn't it?

&gt; It's better than making up numbers to put in a manifesto like other parties, he says.

&gt; ""There's an obsession with people trying to kid each other they've got a crystal ball about the costs incurred by their policies and revenues raised from taxation. What we need is a direction of travel away from the low wage, low productivity, high inequality economy. It's not good for our values. it's not good for the decency and humanity of our society or the economy.""

&gt; And it's true that on values he's far more impressive.

&gt; A righteous anger grips him when he talks about the Tory plan to cut £12bn from welfare.

&gt; He says the whole post-1945 welfare state in jeopardy because successive governments have simply stopped arguing for it, and there needs to be a fresh argument to save it.

&gt; ""We've had decades of anti-welfare propaganda, a wave of argument from Labour and the Tories and some of the right wing media that says people are to blame for their own poverty and a welfare state should not be one that recognises everyone's equal worth and dignity,"" he says.

&gt; ""Under the New Labour government there was the beginning of a shift away from a welfare state that's about people's wellbeing to a benefits system designed to bully people into low-paid work and subsidise low-paid work so that employers don't have to pay what people need to live with a bit of dignity in exchange for their Labour.

&gt; ""That to me is not a morally or economically acceptable nature of a benefits system.

&gt; ""We need to return to the principle that says everybody matters, everybody's well being matter, from cradle to grave we look after each other, that's what a civilised society does.""

&gt; The Scottish Greens may not be about to sweep to power next month, but by playing a longer game, Harvie may well lift them to new heights next year.

- No quirky catchphrases like the whole ""wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey"" thing or ""_____ are cool"".  Repeated over and over and over.

- No zany hats that he wears for like two episodes but then *every* fan has to wear one for some reason.

- No bowties, no 3D glasses, no elaborate hairstyles, no purposefully conflicting (""fancy... but fun"") professional suit with cheap sneakers combo.

- He actually ads a little more variety to his outfit, changing it up a bit between episodes.  Wearing a different shirt underneath from time to time, rather than having the exact same outfit every single episode until they officially change the costume.

- The atmosphere is more toned down too.  His personal theme music is a bit more subtle (though Clara's cute little theme still come in full blast until the other characters acknowledge her presence in the scene).  

Hopefully the Capaldi era will be less ""feel good"", less melodramatic love story.  Not so over-the-top in those aspects.

Flat 442 is, imo, an outdated formation which neither offers enough defensive cover nor allows our more creative attacking players space between the lines in which to operate. Diamond 442 is better in this regard but it's not a personal favourite of mine as it puts too much responsibility on the wing backs to provide the width and on the counter creates the same problems we've seen in the past few games with the DM dropping back in the fill gaps left by the CB shuffling over.

In my preferred 433 / 4231 Sterling for me should play in either the no.10 role or one of the wide berths with a licence to come inside and run at people. Coutinho / Lallana / Markovic fill the remaining slots based on form &amp; opposition. For better opponents or where we need to dominate midfield the #10 drops back 10yds and plays more in the CM slot (Phil operated here for a good portion of last season).

Lastly for as long as I can remember I've been a massive advocate of having a dedicated DM in the side.  Lucas is the only one we have in the team currently, Allen isn't one thing or the other and in my team shouldn't be asked to fill that role.

So, a week consists of 40 periods, 8 per day over 5 days. Generally speaking, each A-Level subject would get three double lessons (6 periods) per week, usually with no more than 4 periods in any one subject on a given day- I wouldn't spend six periods in one day studying just French, for example, but I would have three days with a double period on each. We would study four different A-Level subjects, so this would total 24 periods over the week.

The three other compulsory subjects were Religious Education (RE), Physical Education (PE) and General Studies, which was an A-Level every student took but which was less demanding. PE and RE were compulsory all the way through school, but there was no award for them, they did not go towards an A-Level certificate*. Each of these would get one double lesson per week, totalling 6 periods.

*(If you were interested in religion or sports, there were A-Levels you could take as one of your four subjects- Sports Science and Religious Studies. These would act as any other A-Level, with six periods of study per week on top of the two compulsory RE &amp; PE periods)

The remaining 10 periods would be free periods. These may or may not be spread evenly through the week- you could have one day with 8 periods of study and no free periods, with another day which only had four periods of study and four free periods to balance it out.

So, to give an example, my own weekly rota looked like this:

&gt; Media Studies (6 Periods)

&gt; English Language &amp; Literature (6 periods)

null,false,breezehair,null,null,null,"&gt; The only place that mentions country of birth is the part about new diagnoses. It states this:
&gt; Data on country of birth was available for 83% of people newly diagnosed with HIV. The proportion of new HIV diagnoses reported among people born in Africa halved from 54% (3,460/6,420) in 2004 to 25% (1,240/4,980) in 2013. This has resulted in an increase in the proportion of new diagnoses reported among people born in the UK (from 32% (2,040/6,420) to 46% (2,220/4,980)) over the same period.


&gt; So, the number of sub-Sahara African migrants being diagnosed with HIV is falling. Not entirely the picture Guido paints, no?

Interesting.
Perhaps anti-retroviral therapy is more widely available in Africa (as it shoud be).
Perhaps UK immigration controls have had an effect.  
Perhaps new HIV infection rates in sub-Saharan Africa have gone down.

Guido is not wholly wrong - he may be mostly correct. 

If these are the figures for just one disease, what are the total figures for other diseases?   

It's nice to have more facts.

I presume it would work something like: you put money into ISA bank account. Bank then buys special issue bond from government. Government gives loan to construction company. Alternately, maybe bank loans direct to construction company but the gov't guarantees the loan. 

It's a bit bollocks really.

Is Ross more similar to how Rooney was when he was a similar age, running around the pitch like SpongeBob SquarePants wanting to win every ball, score every goal and be everywhere on the pitch simultaneously?

The reason people in this country are so poor is because everything is solely set up for business to succeed, and when business succeeds only a very small number of people profit. The mantra of business business business is the cause of this - you can see the Tory campaign is built off Labour being ""bad for business"". We are ruthless capitalists. Many argue that raising the rich raises the poor, which I think used to be true, but I'd struggle to see that as true when the rich double their wealth in a recession, while the poorest had theirs reduced.

The minimum wage is not a living wage. A person on minimum wage still needs benefits! How crazy is that? Full time minimum wage job and you still get benefits. That is socialism for business, subsidising their wages. 

Jobs are being sent abroad as it is cheaper, and business only cares about bottom line. Profits from business are being sent abroad, avoiding tax in the UK. Profiting here but paying no tax.

I've said before it's not an evil cabal sitting in a bunker surrounded by gargoyle statues. It's people in clubs and societies, who are so distanced from the poor that they have no concept of their suffering, and consequently don't care. They just want more money.

&gt; But how can people honestly say we SHOULD be in the euro, the UK is the fifth largest econemy in the world. Not being part of Ireland meant we bore significantly less financial troubles, we have control of our interest rates, to deal with our problems. A one size fits all interest policy is hard to maintain

As a nationalist who would like to see a United Ireland in my lifetime, the way I see it is whether or not we are in the Euro is somewhat irrelevant to my life, I and everyone in this thread would live comfortably in the Euro on par with the rest of Europe (not withstanding certain government policies that affect quality of life). The pound is nice, the euro isn't doing massivelly well, for now, it is still in comparison to most world currencies stable and important. 

A countries economic fortunes can change like the wind, the Euro largely didn't force the last Irish government to make bad decisions, they made those shitty decisions (or lack of decisions) themselves and would have done so if they had the Irish £, the British £, or the American $. The last collapse was a world wide, the south didn't fair too well from it, but the ramifications are starting to bite us in the north in the arse while the south is starting to move on. These ramifications are also ideological, so to only want to talk about economics without looking at ideology isn't the right way to argue things anyway since economic policy is dictated by theory and ideas. 

The UK is a very large economy but you have to ask yourself who is seeing the benefit of this? I'm not, Northern Ireland isn't a success story at all economically even after almost 20 years of peace - there were countries in the eastern block who turned their luck around much quicker with much worse poverty and social problems without a sugar daddy to run the place, which I'll remind you is a state almost purely ideological in its formation, existence and defence of - unionist economic arguments were few and far between when the south was one of the richest countries in the world.",null,0,null,1428228283,null,0,1428228616,0,cq1tcta,null,t3_31ako0,null,t1_cq1tcta,null,t3_31ako0,null,null,null,1432206326,null,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3,null

Two former states with two extremely different economic models, forced seperation of populations, and being the front-line of the cold war. Not comparable to Ireland at all - there are similar/almost identical thinking on economics in both jurisdictions, northern and southern society are not separated and travel is fully open between both jurisdictions. 

I would say a united Ireland will always have a devolved northern assembly, so Stormont probably isn't going to be going anywhere. It might not be as powerful, but I'm in favour of a more federalised Ireland. We would be expected to pay our own keep to a certain extent though. 

What about unionist populations? The only way a united Ireland is ever going to happen is with a referendum in both jurisdictions the way we seen in Scotland. I wouldn't agree with forcing anyone to learn something there isnt support for provided it makes sense - we would have Stormont to run education in the North, it could be run by the DUP or UUP for all you know. We could end up seeing creationism on it before protestant people are forced to learn Irish. Besides, Irish education teaching methods are changing because its been a complete failure island wide for generations, no one is interested in forcing people to learn it, I think it should be for schools to decide. 

&gt; And then we have public spending. The PSNI is kitted out more than some armies, they need to be - remember those annual riots- the Guards don't have the training or resources to deal with NI's problems. Public sector employment is 28% in Northern Ireland that's about 200,000, that the Dail would need to pay (to keep them on) or find new jobs for. 

PSNI would still exist. Scotland doesn't have the same police force as England. Even English police forces are very regionalised. We are the unique lot here where the PSNI cover ALL of NI. There are a lot of law reforms that could free up money, thats a different debate for a different day.

&gt; What you end up with in a UI is 1/6 of a country not wanting to be there. 

As opposed to 30-40% of the population in NI not wanting to be in the UK? I think a United Ireland would give unionists a much stronger voice in national (and even international) politics and more choice for localisation than they get in the UK system of government. Thats because we aren't simply going to be absorbed by the ROI and everyone sitting in Leinster House. NI will still exist autonomously.

I Used to have a PAYG SIM with Three, with their £15, all-you-can-eat pack. Yes, it was cheap, but their 3G coverage and speed were pretty poor, I could never get more than around 1.5Mb down and 0.5Mb up, and had frequent dropped calls, and they didn't support visual voicemail on my iPhone.

I switched to an EE contract when I upgraded my phone about 18 months ago, and now pay a fair bit more (£39) - but that gets me 10GB of their [fastest tier 4G](http://i.imgur.com/LKEgZwS.png), unlimited everything else, free calls and texts back to the UK when roaming abroad, reduced roaming data rates and free wifi on the tube network.

I recently moved house and discovered I got very poor signal indoors (basement flat), so EE sent me a free 3G signal box when I called them up, which solved my problem entirely.

They also bent over backwards to help me when I had voicemail issues, sending me out a replacement SIM card, which again fixed my issue.

Drugs and too many children can be issues, though certainly not always, often it's a single parent doing their best to make ends meet after losing their partner or looking after a sick relative. 

Problem is, as much as people would like to, you can't solve all of societies ills through a few extra PSHE lessons and a breakfast club. These families need a route out of poverty or you'll keep seeing it.

But twice now, they've charged me for the extra, not given it and charged me for going over my monthly allowance.

And there are quite a number of 'Benidorms'; are you really suggesting that the numbers are going to be the same?

The economist article compares recently arrived immigrants with Brits who have retired to Spain - which is a bit silly (a few years compared to 10/20 - no surprise there), and then it says;

&gt;No figures exist comparing their demands on the British welfare state with those of Britons on the Spanish system.

Which suggests a one-sided article anyway - but then it gets worse, asserting from an interview with a single person;

&gt;Britons in Lloret are full of praise for Spain’s health system. “Just two beds to a room,” marvels Frank. “You wouldn’t get that on the NHS.”

Not the norm, but more importantly you also don't get any personal care - that includes wiping your ass and so on; in Spain, it's assumed that your family will be in every day to care for you. There isn't much provision outside of that. It's also worth noting that this was the state of play *before* Spain's economy went into the toilet - have a look at what's happened to the pharmacies that the Spanish Government stopped paying, got loans to cover their costs (again, as advised by the Spanish Gov.), then got told a year later that they'd get paid back eventually (but not now), *without interest*. Lots of them have shut down - and that's just one aspect. So yeah - Spanish healthcare, it's fantastic.

Then we get to the article failing to mention that unless they get naturalised, UK expats' treatment is paid for by the UK NHS - fair enough, since they've paid into it for most of their lives while in the UK - but then there would be no article/ outrage. And remember, the Spanish goverment is desperate enough for income that if the expats were actually a drain instead of a boon, they'd be finding ways to get rid of the non-naturalised ones (that didn't leave when their UK money was suddenly worth a lot less, but that happened seven or eight years ago).

&gt;Ireland also has a lot of British benefit tourists.

That's an article about jobless benefits claimers, which is getting a bit out of scope.

We pay him 150k/week, every other player that performs as well as Sterling (which is not that good atm) will demand the same thing, the dressing room will prolly go to shit, we put ourselves in a weakened position for all future contract negotiations, and Sterling still leaves when a bigger club comes for him. If he gets injured or drops in form (remember, he did drop off for a period of time), it becomes a disaster.

We give him 100k/week and he accepts it, its a little too much IMO but still reasonable, we get more leverage if the time comes to sell Sterling, we keep our wage structure and demonstrate that the wage structure is something all contract negotiations must respect.

We give him 100k/week and he rejects it, then he can sit on 35k/week for the next 2 and a half years. If he becomes a world-class player during this time, well we'd get a world-class player playing for us on 35k/week until he leaves for a free. But I really doubt that Sterling would be willing to sit on 35k/week for 2 and a half years, and if he does, credit to him for being so confident in himself at staying injury-free + consistently performing for those 2 years. Sterling is a very good player, but he's far from irreplaceable atm.

null,false,TVKMarkII,null,null,null,"Tax is an unfortunate necessity as part of being a civilised society. It is necessary to tax companies on the basis of profit as they almost always utilise state owned infrastructure in some way and should thus contribute. 

As for human trafficking, that almost always involves kidnap, physical &amp;amp; mental abuse, slavery, and a disregard for people's human rights. It physical harms the victims and thus no, it should not be allowed.

However, as bad as it is, discriminating against someone for a job does not harm them. It does not infringe upon their human rights. It is simply a matter of preference being used by the company that most people disagree with. 

Let's put it a more sensible way that doesn't deal with extreme cases that aren't really relevant. Let's use a much better analogy. For example dating. 

Let's say someone, for whatever reason, refuses to date black people. A black person may have feelings for this person and find them attractive, and wish to be their partner (application for the job). However due to this person's pre-set prejudices, they reject this person (rejection of application), based on their skin colour alone. The black person may be a perfect personality match and an amazing life partner for the first person. But the first is missing out because they refuse to even consider it (like a company missing out on their talent). They'll also become ostracised by those who deem their views racist (boycotted by consumers who dislike their discriminatory policies). However the black person will simply move on and find another person without such prejudices and will have a (hopefully) happy and successful relationship with a more accepting person (a company that doesn't discriminate). It's not like the black person's life was put in danger. They're not threatening them or physically or verbally abusing them. They're not condoning violence against them. They simply don't want to be with them due to an outdated prejudice, and they lose out. It's the same with a company, the discriminated person will go on and find a job at a company that doesn't discriminate, and the discriminating company misses out on what could've been their best employee. You can't force someone to date several people of all different nationalities and ethnicities and cultures, that's an infringement upon their own right to freedom of thought and expression and choice. Why shouldn't the same apply to a company? At the end of the day it will be the company losing out. Not the people being discriminated against.

They can't afford to do both, particularly if their house is old, in poor condition and has outdated, inefficient heating.  We have a hell of a lot of tenants who have had no heating or hot water since well before I started this job, so in excess of two years. 

Our engineers obviously routinely go into houses, and some of the stories they come back with are shocking.  Freezing cold houses with no furniture or carpets, just mattresses to sleep on.  Elderly people living unassisted in complete squalor, people with severe mental health difficulties.  I know one of the guys bought one women groceries on several occasions.  One of the managers has actively sought out social services assistance for at least two tenants that I know of because of their living conditions.

Tax credits aren't all they're cracked up to be either, particularly if your income varies (agency/zero hours contracts, for example).

As an SNP voter and Yes voter, nothing could be further from the truth. I voted yes because I deemed Whitehall, Westminster and the establishment irredeemably corrupt, anti democratic and self serving. And Labour and the English left wing press to be incapable of standing up against these forces on behalf of the people whose interests they claim to stand for. It was made clear: defence of the realm comes before integrity, truth, politics, and anything of relevance, even for those who see themselves as radicals and progressives (with notable exceptions such as George Monbiot, Suzanne Moore etc).

So no, I'm not willing to vote for Labour again, because they have lost their way and can't trusted. But I'm more than willing to participate in British politics, and use Labour as a vehicle to that end, provided there is the possibility for serious reform.

The SNP membership has also exploded since the referendum. Even if past incarnations of the party would have wished for disfunction at Westminster (I wouldn't be surprised if Salmond saw Tory govts as a vehicle for independence) their policies are now formed by tens of thousands of energised working class people, who until a year ago, considered themselves unionists, and who loyalty voted Labour every 5 years.

null,false,Spunkan,EN,england,null,"I said it yesterday and I'll say it again, 82 points will be enough. Would be very surprised if anybody else gets more than that. Here's why:

Man City's maximum total is currently 85, Arsenal 84 and United 83.
-
United still have to play both Man City and Arsenal (both at Old Trafford). This is a win/win for us because no matter what happens, someone is dropping points. If United lose even one of those, their maximum is now 80 points. They're out. If they manage to draw one of those games, that reduces Man City's or Arsenal's maximum to 83 and 82 respectively. Likewise if they manage to win one of those games, that reduces Man City's or Arsenal's maximum it 82 and 81 respectively

We also happen play both United and Arsenal. Even if we only get two points from those games, it means both of those teams will have dropped a further two points. 

Given the hugely inconsistent nature of Man City, I wouldn't put it beyond them to drop at least four points in their remaining fixtures. 

I know we have to assume at least one of these teams will win all of their remaining games, but realistically, I just can't see it happening. I'm not saying we will either nor am I under estimating the teams we play, but our lead is just too big at the moment. We'd have to lose at least twice, with a few draws too, and we have only lost twice all season.

null,false,Nothing-Is-True,EN,england,null,"I think it's a combination of bad luck and Matic and Fabregas not playing at their best. There's been a lot of talk about how Fabregas' form has dipped, but for me the more alarming thing is how invisible Matic has become at times in the last few months.

The Burnley game was bad luck, since we lost Matic in a horror show of a tackle and that took the wind out of our sails. Against Hull it was a bit of both again, they cut through our midfield so easily for the first goal and for their second there was a bit of a misunderstanding between Courtois and Ivanovic. Same story with PSG, although both their goals were from corners, it was scary how easily they moved the ball forwards, which was, in my opinion, once again due to Matic and Fabregas. Even against West Ham, we didn't concede and Matic was not playing either, but they had a plethora of chances created by simply running at us. I didn't watch the Southampton game so I can't comment on that. On yesterday, well, what can you do against a goal like that really. I think we played our best game yesterday for the first time in a while.

I don't know how to solve this problem really, or even if it can be solved by anything other than letting them play through it until they find that magic touch again. Only Hazard and Willian seem to be at their best in recent weeks out of our midfielders. Despite that, I still think we'll win the league comfortably.

Edit: I think we should also take note of how we've only lost two games in the league this season, while Arsenal, in second, have lost six. I don't think we've won four league games in a row all season as well. While that may be a cause for concern for some of you, I think that's a brilliant thing.

* ICT is about more than Excel, teach the kids to program. Teach them python they will have a better chance of getting a job in later years.
* Someone needs to be teaching about statistics since no one seems to understand them.
* Teach critical thinking. Saying things like ""I may not like what you have to say but I will fight for your right to say it"" should be the norm.

&gt;This Ghetto crowding is not through inclination, but compulsion. Nearly fifty per cent of the workers pay from one-fourth to one-half of their earnings for rent. The average rent in the larger part of the East End is from four to six shillings per week for one room, while skilled mechanics, earning thirty-five shillings per week, are forced to part with fifteen shillings of it for two or three pokey little dens, in which they strive desperately to obtain some semblance of home life. And rents are going up all the time. In one street in Stepney the increase in only two years has been from thirteen to eighteen shillings; in another street from eleven to sixteen shillings; and in another street, from eleven to fifteen shillings; while in Whitechapel, two-room houses that recently rented for ten shillings are now costing twenty-one shillings. East, west, north, and south the rents are going up. When land is worth from L20,000 to L30,000 an acre, some one must pay the landlord. [128-129]

&gt; Article says ""Since 2006, entry rates for disadvantaged pupils to university have soared by 61 per cent.

Then moves from this to say ""but..

&gt; The lack of social mobility will be a familiar refrain during the general election campaign. The seven per cent of children who are privately educated exert an inordinate dominance over British life, as The New Statesman has frequently highlighted: they provide 70 per cent of high court judges, a majority of FTSE100 chief executives and journalists and over 40 per cent of students at Oxford and Cambridge.

&gt;The implication seems clear: **Britain is becoming a society ever more rigged in favour of those born into family wealth and connections""**

Lets take their ""majority of FTSE chief executives are privately educated"" as an example to illustrate this basic mistake. 

So since 2006, loads more disadvantaged kids have gone to uni. But they aren't proportionally represented in powerful positions. 

So lets say a disadvantaged person went to uni in 2006. They would have graduated in 2009. Lets assume they went at a normal age and graduated age 21. Its only been 6 years, so they are now **27**. 

[Average age of a FTSE Chief exec is **53**](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/afe2f10e-b411-11e2-ace9-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3WR6NRuc1)

The current chief execs will reflect the state of the country's educational social mobility just over 30 years ago, when Thatcher was in power. I'm not overtly anti-thatcher, but it's pretty clear to me that there were less opportunities for disadvantaged and state educated kids then than there are now. 


It's so fucking typical of the New Statesmen to make this kind of error. Public schools are ruling us, its getting worse and worse, your children have no hope! No. Fuck that. Its brilliant that people from all backgrounds are having the chance to get to university, and have the chance to go for those top jobs. But going to uni isn't the end of the road, they still have to grow up and work their way there. You don't graduate from uni straight into a FTSE CEO position, or being a high court judge. It takes a lot of work over at least 2, maybe 3 decades. We are planting seeds for the country to be better off in the long term, we should recognise that and encourage that.

Actually, its been shown that UKIP is a rural phenomenon and areas more likely to vote UKIP are disproportionately less impacted by immigration. It may, however, be reasonable to conclude that UKIP supporters are more impacted by the depression of wages that has occurred over the last 3 decades, given the lower likelihood of a university degree this implies jobs in manual labour etc.

This is why the issue of immigration is so well discarded by the SNP, for example. Glasgow, for example, has high levels of immigration and high levels of menial jobs that have been put under extreme pressure since the 1980s. The SNP appear message is to associate the drop in wages with a number of factors, of which immigration is such a tiny part.

The Labour party, Lib Dems (and to a lesser extent the Greens, who seem to just want to replace the Lib Dem centre left position) should have learnt a valuable lesson here.

Basic GSCE economics defeats you.

Increase supply, price goes down.

So what happens when you increase the labour supply massively?

Note how in Australia... they restrict migration massively denying people for the slightest criminal infraction. Yet they have a min wage of $16.48 or £9 an hour.

The UK min wage is £2.49 an hour due to abuse of the apprentice system.

If you had any sense of history we've been here before multiple times.

British business is super short sighted and business people are not known for seeing the bigger picture and lack this type of business acumen. This is throughout British history, that is not to say that other people make these mistakes.

The British business model is this in a nut shell. Suppress rights and wages of workers. If we suppress wages and rights then we'll have a great economy! Not how UK workers have less rights than those in China.

http://www.oecd.org/employment/emp/oecdindicatorsofemploymentprotection.htm

They forget one important aspect, while short term profits are boosted demand is crushed. Demand drives jobs. Crush wages and rights and you end up with a 1990s China where people save money because of the lack of rights and insecurity of income. No spending = no demand.

No demand = nobody hiring.

By demand I mean realistic demand. Sure I may want a superbike but can't afford it = not real demand. 


The current situation is a make the rich richer and demand will pick up! I'm sure champagne, super car makers and caviar producers might get a boost... but what about everybody else?

We've been here before the 1950s and 1960s textile industry wanted super cheap labour so imported people from the empire. Our world class textile industry which is the envy of the world is testament to how successful this policy happened to be.

The 2000s and beyond if only we could suppress wages some more....


On the other side we have infrastructure. The UK does not build any additional infrastructure whatsoever. 

Demand without increasing supply? Causes things here to be used by more people. Take for instance Beijing. Every year I go there they have new train lines new roads new buildings etc. Here they let lots of people but build nothing to support them.

Take for instance the microcosm of Hong Kong. Whenever a new housing estate is built, new roads are built as are new bus routes and train routes. Ma On Shan is an excellent example. 16 years ago it was a sleepy village in the middle of Tolo district. When they built housing on it they built an MTR line to it several new roads and also under sea pipes for water and sewage.

In the UK when they build a new housing estate? They just bolt it onto the existing infrastructure without adding extra capacity. Case in point Salford and Blackley. All the land around was derelict through the 90s. So they built houses on it around 2014. No extra roads were built to accommodate this. They simply put a traffic light at the junction.",null,0,null,1428237812,null,0,1428238602,0,cq1vdfh,null,t3_31cvp5,null,t1_cq1vdfh,null,t1_cq1v5x2,null,null,null,1432207277,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

It is in *nobody's* interest to produce accurate figures about the cost of visitors or migrants to the health service.  The minister and civil service want a low figure, otherwise they look incompetent. They will therefore prepare figures on as narrow a definition as possible, to make it smaller. 

Hospitals and front-line medical staff gain nothing by trying to estimate it. Billing people -- particularly billing poor people -- is likely to be expensive and futile. Hospitals would be attacked in the press for being heartless if they tried to do it.

It's a legal privilege that EU citizens have by virtue of being in the EU, which means they benefit not because of race or nationality, but because they are signed up. The fact that nationality appears to be a factor is irrelevant.

It's like signing up to a reward scheme where you buy ten things and then get one free. If I buy ten things while a member of the scheme, and you buy ten things but you haven't signed up, it's not discrimination if they give me my free product and you don't get one. That's because, at it's heart, there is a contract, just like there are pseudo-contractual terms for the EU free movement of persons. By allowing free movement unrestricted, we get the same rights for our citizens AND the benefit of free movement of goods (no import tariffs) and the benefit of the EU anti-competition laws, etc. 

If you want another example of why it can't be racism, the obligation to allow free movement of persons is owed to states, not persons. This means we allow free movement of the European state, not each citizen. By denying free movement to an extra-EU state, and therefore it's citizens, we are not being racist, because you cannot be racist to an intangible entity.

Its absolute madness that they aren't taxed more.
For a start, Landlords and not tenants should pay council tax on the buildings they own (none of this ""pay for what you use"" bullshit logic).
This would stabilize the market faster than anything, then you could gradually increase the taxation until it becomes greater than the amount spent on housing benefit.
This would free up a huge amount of personal expenditure for the average working person.

null,false,JasonTheMessiah,cnty-wales,English Dude in Wales,null,"I understand what you're saying, none of which I really disagree with, but you're jumping the gun here to spout what *you* want to say rather than answering. I never said immigration is not a problem. It's simply not the worst problem we have. 

The infrastructure in this country can not sustain even our own domestic population. My Mum ran a shop in town, got dozens of people from the job centre to come do work experience. Local, British people looking to work. The problem? They're all unemployable. The issue could also be, not just having too many people for x amount of jobs, but also those extra people being unemployable. The quality of CV's that come into my office is shocking.

That being said, there is still a wealth of intelligent people looking for work. I managed to find work, in South Wales. A place that has one of the highest levels of unemployment. And I didn't even finish my degree. Now, I did once lose a job because the cafe owner was Polish and he wanted to have the hot blonde (also Polish worker) replace me. Did I get angry? Yes. But that didn't make me prejudiced.

A huge issue is the distribution of wealth and the amount of money going into the system. The economy is wounded and companies are holding onto profits and bonus schemes whilst being far too careful about creating jobs. The amount of tax taken off the super rich is disgusting, and the huge profits and bonuses earned are put into offshore accounts and spent abroad. The money fucking sits around or gets spent into another country. 

There is the issue of housing as well but another news flash is the hundreds of thousands of empty buildings and homes currently standing. We, understandably, have the problem of finding land to build on. To make enough new homes. Without immigration, our population would still increase (albeit slower) so again, it's not the major issue. There are plenty of currently standing properties that could be converted into buy-to-lets and first buys and council rent etc. But they're just sitting there derelict. Not enough funding. 

Wage, my friend, has been going up. The wage is not the issue, inflation is. Inflation is flying up, quicker than wages, so of course wages gets the blame. The increase in wages over the last 5-10 years has been rapid. Inflation far worse. 

We have more monopolies and mega corporations than ever and raw materials are getting more experience in some industries. Oil is getting expensive (forget the previous dip) and these are major drivers for inflation. 

TL;DR - Immigration is a minor issue compared with the much more influential issues of poor distribution of wealth. Mega corporations, not enough tax from these entities going back into the system. It's creating a rate of inflation and a power over the poorer to barely live by their means. They simply have to point at immigration to distract us from a bigger problem. Them. In our paranoiac society, we love the excuse of immigrants, and Farage is the perfect, charismatic person to weave this said BS.",null,0,null,1428238744,null,0,false,0,cq1vmr1,null,t3_31cvp5,null,t1_cq1vmr1,null,t1_cq1vdfh,null,null,null,1432207398,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

What it boils down to is - there are 4 teams that can and do spend more than us, some twice as much. Higher wage bills and higher value starting XI's. The only way to counter this is either amazing management, which can only go so far without the financial wherewithal, and second, what FSG is trying to do, which is increase revenue through clever financial management to get us to a level where we can start buying the same players that maybe Arsenal does, although we may never be able to afford the players United, Chelsea and City can throw money at. Until then, anything above 5th is outperformance and anything below 5th is poor. That's the benchmark. There is literally **no precedent** in the modern Premier League of any teams significantly punching above their financial weight consistently - Arsenal is the closest example but even they have a wage bill 30m-40m higher than ours, and a long-serving respected manager. We should shoot for their model medium-term and then see about getting above 4th. And until Rodgers looks incapable of making 5th regularly and/or there is a massive gap between us in 5th and the team in 4th, talk of replacing the manager with an incredible alternative is wishful thinking.

If you've ever read around /r/China or /r/TELF you will find that many view the Chinese education system as corrupt. The UK system is quite corrupt also, many of those individuals are a product of a system which specifically engineered them to be that way. If you read the wolf report published in 2011 it was startling. Colleges essentially dumbed down qualifications and made them so narrow that they were useless outside the particular niche. The individuals who send their CVs to you are a result of this. They did this to trap them. Where they couldn't get jobs so had to go back to college. This kind of thing still goes on. A local college I've taught at has a motor engineering course. They teach things like maintenance of drum brakes which went out of date about 15 years ago. Even cheap cars have full disc brakes.

Secondly a lot of people make rational short term choices based on the circumstances they found themselves in. Gordo and his 16 hours tax credits topping up wages to that of a full time job was uber destructive. People made choices and cut their hours adversely affecting their futures.

&gt;There is the issue of housing as well but another news flash is the hundreds of thousands of empty buildings and homes currently standing. We, understandably, have the problem of finding land to build on. 

There is no real scarcity. It is completely artificial in nature due to planning laws and intentional policies. Look at Hong Kong... super population density right crowded? Not really... 87% of the land is undeveloped country park. The UK hasn't even explored building upwards... or downwards either.

Someones making lots of money off of this and it sounds like council/local taxes paid the bill to repair the buildings. Wonder if £3k price affects the price of the 'affordable housing' left too

&gt;A series of  squats in Rushcroft Road, Brixton, will be refurbished and rented as affordable homes  while others will be sold off, a senior councillor has said.

&gt;Lambeth council confirmed it will sell two of the four-storey Victorian mansion blocks that it owns to private developers, effectively using some of the profit to refurbish a further 24 flats after the squatters are evicted.

&gt;The squatters are expected to be evicted later this year, and Lambeth estimates £2.75million is needed to bring the 24 flats up to a suitable condition to rent.

&gt;Cllr Pete Robbins, cabinet member for neighbourhood services, said: “Following repossession, Lambeth is retaining and refurbishing 24 dwellings, consisting of three leaseholders and two ‘flying’ freeholders and 19 flats currently occupied by unauthorised persons, which will be allocated via Choice Based Lettings.”

&gt;A ‘flying’ freeholder is someone who lives in a property that overhangs another property – for instance, if a room is above a shared corridor space or a balcony above a room in a flat below.

&gt;The council isn’t legally allowed to ringfence money from the sale of one asset to spend on another, so the money will go into the main council pot and it is a separate promise to refurbish the remaining flats.


&gt;Homer, Granville and Oval Houses are all being retained by the Council. £1,975,660 has already been spent on refurbishing the properties. An extra £1,345,511 is now needed in order to complete the project by March 2015.

&gt;Hereford and Rosslyn Houses sold for a combined value of £2.5m. The Council stated at the time that this money would be invested back in the existing three blocks to help fund 24 flats for council tenants. The extra money now needed is coming out of the Housing budget for next year.

4. We acquired him during the Jan Window. (meaning he HAS to come to make a direct impact like Matic did)
4. We don't have any other true winger options outside of him 

We are left with NO other options if Hazard gets hurt (pray to god this doesn't happen). Which is a probable thing since he gets fouled the most in the league. We SHOULD expect positive performances from him.

He hasn't even put together a solid 10 minute performance. 

He made good runs that lead to nothing. He should have finished that goal, didn't. Gets stripped almost every time on ball. Passes to Charlie Adams feet saying ""shoot."" 

Ya, he needs more time, but it's time we don't have. We have 3 other teams clipping our asses. He needs to step up.

How he carded Bell and not some of the Hearts challenges like that thug on Black at the end is beyond me.

The atmosphere was fucking electric. It's the best game I've seen in four years. Two excellent goals. Players like Vuckic just show the gulf between the Scottish leagues and English reservists.

Hearts are the champions but they certainly didn't play like it today.

P.S. Besides the result the best thing about today was hearing ""Substitution for Hibs..."" blaring out the tannoy. :D

Unfortunately, undiagnosed sufferers are going to be the more expensive ones, because they will reach a later stage of the disease, and in the meantime they will infect more people. The actual story of the Telegraph article is that after 2012, migrants *can* access HIV treatment for exactly this reason - and of course it is right that they should. 

It is difficult for any of us to produce refined figures, because the necessary data is only reluctantly published. 

Between the lower estimate you have found and the higher estimate of Guido F. is 0.2 - 1% of the UK health budget, for a single small ethnic migrant group, for a single disease. 

People are reasonable and generous, but it would be good to know correct figures about what we are actually providing. 

For migrants, access to free first world healthcare may be an enormous incentive to come here.

We really struggle without Davis, he's one of the only guys who will carry the ball forward, play a pass into someone's feet despite them being under pressure, and continue his run looking for a quick 1-2. Without him we just pass around safely waiting for the *perfect* opportunity.

On buying established players vs youth talent 
---
In fantasy land, Liverpool is able to attract top established players with no consistent CL football and no excessive wages. That's fantasy land though, a place many fans here are dreaming in. Liverpool are a big club that spends a lot, but in the league where we are competing, the EPL, there are four clubs that can and do spend more than us.

You really think Daniel Levy and Liverpool's transfer committee hasn't been desperately trying to attract 'world-class established talent'? People think that Spurs made a mistake by buying loads of good but not great players; I think they bought the best players that were willing to come at reasonable money. 

Stop dreaming about 'buying established world-class talents'. Unless we get very lucky or are willing to pay ludicrous amounts of money, no such players are coming. For the last 10-15 years, all the great players that played for Liverpool established themselves as truly great AT liverpool. Suarez, Torres, Alonso, Mascherano, Reina, Lucas. The best, already-established, player we bought in the last 10 years is Glen Johnsen. 

Wake up guys. Its not that the LFC transfer committee doesn't want to buy top established talent. Its that no top-class talent wants to come unless we pay crazy money, but there are four clubs in this league that can spend more than us.


On Liverpool's performance this season
---
Just look at the quality of our squad. There is a clear gulf in quality and depth between Liverpool and our rivals Man Utd/Arsenal. We have the edge over Spurs in first XI quality, but Spurs probably have better depth overall. Demanding that Rodgers be sacked for achieving 5th/6th, the level which the squad is at, is ludicrous. You sack underperforming managers or managers that seem to be going nowhere; Rodgers is doing NEITHER.

In the first half of the season, the loss of SAS meant that we had to radically adjust the way our team played as compared to last season. How can you not expect the team to struggle during a transition phase, where our team radically reshapes and adjusts to the loss of our superstar talisman and the introduction of new players? 

Btw, Man United played like shit and struggled to adjust just like we did. The difference is that they had world-class established players to bail them out, whereas we had young players fluffing up chances, players losing confidence and dropping out of form (can anyone blame Rodgers for Migs losing confidence and form from out of nowhere?). Again, this boils down to overall squad quality.

The test of Rodger's quality as a manager would be whether or not he would be able to turn the team around and recover. And he did that. Honestly, I thought it would take him next season to recover because very few managers manage to do it mid-season, but much to my surprise, Rodgers managed it. Btw, Klopp and Dortmund shat the bed far worse than we did, and Dortmund has a significantly stronger squad than we do, so it makes me laugh when I see the Rodgersout wagon suggesting Klopp as a replacement.

If we get top four this season, it would be an over-achievement. Fifth/sixth is par for course. But par for course is good enough for me if progress is made, and the young age of our squad means that our team is only going to improve.

On Liverpool's long term strategy/Going forward
--- 

How is Liverpool going to get back into the top four when there are four other clubs that are 1 or 2 steps ahead in squad quality, prestige and financial power? 

If we traded transfers with Man United, i'm very confident that we would be in the top four instead of United. We got Markovic, they got Di Maria, we got Moreno, they got Blind, we got Lovren, they got Rojo, we got Lambert, they got Falcao (meh, you have your fair share of duds even when buying 'established talent'), we got Lallana, they got Herrera.

But we can't afford the money. Even if we could, the players DON'T WANT TO COME. Our 'marquee' signing is Balotelli, a supremely talented player that no one else wants for obvious reasons.

The only sane and reasonable strategy (or we could do a Portsmouth/Leeds like some fans are suggesting) is FSG's current policy; buy talented young players who are willing to come for reasonable money and focus on youth. We cannot buy a top four team, we have to develop one.

Some of them, like Sterling, are going to want to leave for bigger clubs once they become established. That's the reality when you don't have the financial muscle and prestige to compete. What we need to hope for is that some of those that establish themselves here will be willing to stay and play for us. Because we don't have the ability to buy top 4 material players, we have to develop top 4 material players. Players like Can, Coutinho, Henderson, Sakho, Sterling and Ibe. 

This squad is raw, but it has loads of potential to build on. On hindsight, last season is a bit of a curse, because we suddenly have deluded supporters thinking that this squad is actually top 4 material. We massively over-achieved due to Suarez and Rodger's ability to get the most out of him but some fans seem to think its the level this Suarez-less squad should be competing at.

If you look just based on results, it does seem like its one step forward one step back under Rodgers. But if you look at our actual squad quality, depth, and age, we have made big strides. It's still going to be a consistent struggle for top four for the forseeable future, but that's the best strategy LFC has at the moment.",null,0,null,1428241315,null,0,false,0,cq1wfsd,null,t3_31inyp,null,t1_cq1wfsd,null,t3_31inyp,null,null,null,1432207849,null,129,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,129,null

If we go for Depay, then it will trigger a lot of bigger clubs to go for him too. If we got him for 20m I'd be fucking ecstatic. I'd like Higuain and although I feel as though your price is realistic, I think he'll stay at Napoli especially if they're going to be getting a new manager. Reid would be such a bland signing, and that has apparently been our 'big' issue in the transfer market. Not so sure about some of these. From what I've seen of Romero, he wouldn't be that big an upgrade on Migs (if an upgrade at all), but as he is the cheaper of your two options then I can see him being a good 2nd choice. I've never seen Neto play. 


Out of all the ones you have noted the ones I'd like to see are Clyne, Pjanic, Vietto, Depay and Ings. However, as Southampton are about on the same level as us at the moment, I don't see us getting Clyne unless we significantly overpay (like, more than Fat Luke Shaw type price). If we spent 25m on Lallana then I find it unlikely we'll get Pjanic for only a couple of mill more. Also, Roma has an ~~raging~~ EDIT: ageing squad and he is crucial to their future, so I don't see him moving unless to one of the big 3 (Bayern, Real or Barca). Vietto seems to be gathering a lot of interest but I can see being a fairly reasonable signing. The issue we could have is waiting a season then him getting more and more attention and having an inflated price (see Dybala). Ings I'm fairly confident we'll sign. Been a fan of him since Burnley were in the championship and think he could form a solid partnership with Sturridge. As I said before, I doubt we'll get Depay. The only way I see us getting him is if Sterling goes and then we use a hefty chunk of the money we get from that on him.

Overall this is a good post, nice to see some 'realistic' targets (although some of them may be pipe dreams).

Even if there was a lack of oxygen, it would start and probably idle fine, but a lack of power when accelerating would be evident. 

If I was you, I'd be checking the spark. Pull the plugs out with the leads still attached and connect a jump lead to the plug and earth it to the bike. See what kind of spark you're getting (it may be a coil pack of HT lead playing up).  

Assuming that's ok, the next thing to check is fuel supply. I'm a car tech so I might be completely wrong, but I'm sure bikes have an electronic fuel pump in the tank. Pull the main fuel supply pipe for the engine and turn the ignition on. You should get quite a bit of fuel coming out (assuming a decent fuel level). If that's ok then I'd be checking the spray pattern of the injectors ( this is really, really dangerous, especially with petrol). They should be spraying a fine mist, like an aerosol. If they're spraying a liquid, then the injector is faulty. 

(You're probably extremely bored by now) If that's ok, you may have a timing issue (again, I don't know how Ducati's are manufactured. By hand or...?). If the guy says you're losing pressure on a cylinder, then it could be caused by timing or valve clearances. Easy way to check for good timing is vacuum. If both cylinders are pulling a good vacuum, equally as good, the timing is ok. 

You may be out of your depth doing this, you may not, but I'm just telling you what I would be checking as a (car) tech, so that you can compare it to what the other guys done.

Well, Schurrle didn't do shit for us this year outside of the 1 really clutch goal against Man City. 

As for Serie A, I don't think it's a bunch of chumps at all. I'm just saying the style is different. They definitely have great players that would start on any other team. But the style of defending there is much different than to what it is here. I think if you asked most people what league defenders are most aggressive in, they'd say the PL. It takes awhile to adjust, and I'm not going to berate him for putting in a few bad performances this year when I hardly expected anything from him in the 1st place. 

I think what happened to Erik Lamela is going to happen with Cuadrado. Lamela went from Roma to Spurs in 2013, and he sucked last year. A lot. He played sparingly, just like Cuadrado has this year, and everybody started labelling him a flop. He wasn't used to the PL yet, but in his second year, he's been much, much better for Spurs, and that ridiculously stupid label of flop has gone out the window, he's been a key player for Spurs in their pursuit of Top 4 this year, getting 5 goals and 4 assists in 19 appearances. I expect a similar breakthrough for Cuadrado next year. 

And lastly, I don't get why the money matters. It's not like we're some small club that's going to lose lots and lots of money if Cuadrado does become a flop. I mean Torres was a 1000 times worse, and yet that move didn't set us back financially at all, and we were still able to offload him, *eventually*. Just because Cuadrado cost a lot, doesn't mean he's found the magic ability to transition from leagues instantly.

Perhaps that day's profits should go to the injured party also.

Seems harsh, but it might make them reconsider printing utter bullshit knowing they can then leave it a week and print a tiny retraction among the small ads.

That and tomorrow's Sun would be nice to see, a front page reading, 'Sorry Ed, we're a shower of lying scumbags'.

Do they deny global warming? Well, not per se, but they refuse to accept that it is at all influenced by mankind and this is in spite of tons of scientific evidence otherwise. You can't even deny this, seeing as there was an interview on science and research posted very recently to this subreddit in which they said just that.

Finally, there's the racism. Again, these ""isolated"" incidents are nearly a daily occurrence: MPs refusing to sit next to people with ""negroid"" features, for example.

1. The focus on profits and deals: In the current state of the sport, money gets you good players. The top academies are amazing because of the large amount of money going into them. Finding a diamond in the rough for 10 mil does not happen. You have to buy the real top player for a hefty price. With Levy that will never happen.

2. The Stadium: This adds onto point one, with the new stadium being built, Spurs have even less money now. We better hope our young players continue to get better because we are fucked if not. This stadium is gonna drain us of any funds. I'd rather stay at WHL and buy the finished products that we need. 

3. Fan attitude: Supporters seem to enjoy cheering for a select group of players and not the whole team. If someone's favorite player doesn't play they begin to get pissed at the manager and team. It's really counter productive.
TLDR: Our main problems are lack of transfer market awareness, terrible ownership and fund management (Lewis and Levy), fan attitude, and the constant sucking off or hatred of some players.",null,1,null,1428245130,null,0,false,0,cq1xwrg,null,t3_31irv3,null,t1_cq1xwrg,null,t3_31irv3,null,null,null,1432208542,null,-3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,-3,null

A lot of it I think is down to the ingrained idea that if you don't work you should be denied any pleasure or luxury - but nowadays it's an outdated concept because there's not enough paid work to go around, therefore people aren't choosing not to work.  No it's not a great TV, but I'm very grateful to have it, and it's saving me money each week on being far more efficient in electricity use.

Sadly, most of the time, new technology is cheaper to run than old tech, but we'd rather ensure people are having to use crappy old stuff, than accept they'd spend less having newer, because they need to be punished for being poor.

The number of times that players are just standing still, or pausing to look for a runner is amazing to me. It's like this is a team of strangers, even though the majority of them have had at least a couple years together. And that's what get's me about Spurs - I can see teams like Burnley, West Brom, Crystal Palace or any of the supposed ""lower league"" teams actually know which role everyone plays, have each others backs and act like a unit.

Spurs don't play like this regularly enough to be a convincing top four contender, hence why when Eriksen or Kane or whoever the bright spark of the past few games gets snuffed out, the whole bunch of them play flat. They should *know* where each other are and where they're going to be moving to. I mean, Spurs were pioneers of the Push &amp; Run tactic and yet we see players looking abandoned on the pitch time and again.

This isn't just from this season it must be said - it's been like it for god knows how long.

In each year you can put new funds into one cash ISA and one S&amp;S ISA, but funds deposited in previous years can be split up and recombined and transferred around between as many different 'pots' as you like, including transferring between Cash and S&amp;S ISAs in either direction.

*Vietto while he is no doubt talented, but 1 good season and age 21.  Not star player by any means.  That's a straight choo choo hype pick.  He is small height wise, not very muscular and we have plenty of that build already.

*GK's are a good shout to give competition to Mignolet.

*RB's - Clyne would be good, but 20 mill might be a bit much.  I would like to see Van Rhijn from Ajax, De Sciglio AC Milan, or Serge Aurier Toulouse on loan at PSG.

*LB's - I think Moreno has potential, but needs more time to learn.  I wouldn't mind us searching for a better first team starter.  Ricardo Rodriguez (Wolfsburg) comes to mind, and also Jetro Willems (PSV).

*Firmino is an excellent player.

*Ings - of course he's free with potential

*Depay - would be an excellent buy just because of what the kid could become.  If we buy for 20 mill now a few years down the road we could sell for 40-50 to reup the squad then.

*Strikers - Mitrovic (Anderlecht) would be a smart move.  I know he isn't a proven goal scorer in a big league, but I think he would be what everyone hoped Lambert/Balotelli would be for us (a reliable, solid goal scorer back up to Sturridge).

&gt;The __Type 45 destroyer__, also known as the __D__ or ___Daring*-class__, is an advanced class of [guided missile destroyers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_missile_destroyer) built for the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom)'s [Royal Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy). The class is primarily designed for [anti-aircraft and anti-missile warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare) and is built around the [PAAMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAAMS) (Sea Viper) air-defence system utilizing the [SAMPSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAMPSON) [AESA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_electronically_scanned_array) and the [S1850M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S1850M) long-range radars. The first three destroyers were assembled by [BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems_Surface_Fleet_Solutions) from partially prefabricated ""blocks"" built at different shipyards, the remaining three were built by [BAE Systems Maritime – Naval Ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems_Maritime_%E2%80%93_Naval_Ships). The first ship in the *Daring* class, [HMS *Daring*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Daring_(D32\)), was launched on 1 February 2006 and commissioned on 23 July 2009.

Everyone gets all twisty knickers about us buying young players (I expect over the next few windows our signings will get a little older every time) but it's obvious Rodgers is trying to build a squad a) large enough to cope with a proper title race, not apparently relying on one player like everyone seems to want and b) where the first team players are hitting their peak around the same time.

So Rodgers won't buy what I'd call a ""star"" player, FSG won't sanction it and Liverpool have never really done it anyway.  We can't - and shouldn't try to - compete with City, Chelsea and Utd for spending so it's obvious we need a sound plan which isn't about buying in peak players as and when they're needed.  That won't bring a club in our financial position any long-term success.

But apart from the pessimism I agree; we've got the strongest squad I've seen at LFC, but arguably our first team isn't as good as the current top four teams.  So in the summer we should be putting the money into two or three signings who can instantly claim a first team place.  

I'm sure this is the plan now the squad is so strong - and the examples you give are exactly the kind of players I'd expect to see us make moves for.

1. I think they all get you the same tickets.  Nationalrail.co.uk is my default, it has decent search and will send you to the actual operators to buy tickets

2. not sure.

I believe they also have to offer you the ""any operator"" tickets - it's worth looking at all the tickets they offer you.

Actually I would say that Balotelli gets way more leniency on this sub and is why this thread is here in the first place. So if we follow your logic why isn't Lovren getting the same treatment? He has looked good in recent games but I don't see anyone moaning that we aren't 'using him properly' and that he hasn't been given enough chances. But because it's Balotelli he gets a lot more slack and people constantly defend him. 

&gt;Plus I'd love to hear you argue that Sturridge or even Sterling are currently better than him

Not going to argue Sterling because that is debatable. But how you can say Balotelli is better than Sturridge I will never understand. A job of a striker is to score goals.

(In the league) Sturridge has started 7 games and played 12. He has then scored 4 goals.

(In the league) Balotelli has started 8 games and played 14 games. He has scored 1 goal.

[Source](http://imgur.com/QXaE9yy)

With so little goals I don't understand how you can say Balotelli has been better than Sturridge. And before you say we aren't utilising him properly we haven't been using Sturridge properly either. Sturridge has been isolated and has been left on his own all season, something that doesn't bring out the best in him. Plus add the fact that he was coming back from bad injury. Difference between the two is that Sturridge can actually put himself about and sniff out a goal unlike Balotelli.

You are trying to define what a party stands for and what 18% of the British people back by a few people who made stupid tweets and were ejected from the party. Let me ask you a question. Does the Liberal Democrat party preach that it's okay to be a criminal and go to prison? Because that's what happened to Chris Huhne.

When you actually break your reasoning down, it is so poor and doesn't suit your narrative even slightly. Your reasoning is that UKIP is a racist party because an ex-candidate said she disliked negroid features. I invite you to tell me in that case why Labour is not a racist party when they have a former BNP activist standing for them?

My experience was in the sixth form of a school, although not the school I had attended until then. It was in some ways a bit out of the ordinary, since this was a particularly academic private girls' school.

We didn't have to wear uniform, although in this particular school no one did (which is unusual for pre-sixth form, but reasonably normal for sixth formers). In the school day, we started with registration at 8:30 (during which nothing much happens except making sure we are there and sometimes giving some notices), and reasonably frequent assemblies. There were eight lesson periods a day, each 35 mins long, although we often had double lessons. About half of us did 5 subjects in the first year and 4 in the second, the rest 4 and then 3, and each subject used about 7 periods a week in the first year and 8 in the second, and we were free to do what we liked with the rest of the time - although we also had some time each week for general interest talks, and later on extra time where they'd help with university applications, or give extra preperation lessons for specific subject tests for university if you were doing them (e.g. there are tests for medicine, and some universities insist on extra things for specific subjects). 

We could leave if we wanted at lunchtime or if we were free in the last double lessons of the day if we signed out. But often we had clubs or societies going on at lunchtime or after school, so didn't - unless you wanted to go out and smoke or something. We also could hang around in the sixth form common room (which had nice sofas, a table football table, computers, wifi...), and we often stayed there if we had free time in the day, or went to the library if we wanted to work.

I must have done a fair bit of work, but I don't really remember it taking up all that much time with the exception of a few pieces of coursework and revision for exams. I didn't do essay subjects though, and was always quite quick at getting maths problems etc. done, so probably spent less time working than many people. I didn't have a part time job or anything though, but I spent a lot of my spare time doing music. Various social things did happen, it never felt difficult to balance.

Many teachers would be fairly relaxed with us, treating us basically like adults, and (particularly in the music department) some of them would joke around with us a lot. After school concerts we'd often end up in one of the nearby pub, although we'd go to the one that wouldn't bother IDing and that wasn't the one the teachers were going to - until about April of the last year (when the teachers could at least plausibly believe we were mostly 18) when we'd go to the pub with them. School put on a posh dinner for us in June after our final A-level exams were done as well - and they fed us very nice alcohol there too. (For reference, you'll turn 18 at some point between the september at the start of your last year of sixth form and the following september.) Also, shortly before we left, we put on for the rest of the school a show-like thing poking fun at various parts of the school - this happened every year. On the final day before we went on study leave - which in our school was known as ""Muck up day"" -, we all dressed up and got to school very early in the morning to muck around - we moved a classroom onto the roof, put up silly decorations (including replacing all of the clocks with pictures), faked a silly letter to the teachers from management, and a massive bunch of other stuff, including all going and lying over the main school entrance corridor at the start of the day (this was traditional...). This was all semi-sanctioned by the teachers - it was expected that we do it, and although they warned us not to go too far they were fine with it, and some of them were quite amused =D.",null,0,null,1428249098,null,0,false,0,cq1zrat,null,t3_31gm64,null,t1_cq1zrat,null,t3_31gm64,null,null,null,1432209413,null,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5,null

I saw someone lament our form yesterday -- two league losses in the whole of 2015 and apparently we're out of form and should fear for even a finish in the Europa spots! It's bordering on ridiculous. 

We take it one game at a time. 3 points from each match is what we need, and we then hope that United, Arsenal or even City drop points so we can lessen the gap. It's not an easy ask, and its horrible that we don't have our destiny in our own hands, but if last season proved anything it's that -- even when it feels certain that something will happen -- nothing's a given until the end of the season. United have hard games, City have a poor away record this year, and Arsenal (although looking lethal) could still pull an Arsenal and drop off [just look at the damage Monaco did to them].

null,false,UHM-7,null,null,null,"I believe there is no solution - humans are doomed no matter what. Some may say that's a pessimistic view. Here's why I think that:

Humans are programmed, by evolution, to reproduce. It's an instinct. And nothing is stronger than an instinct. Humans, or any other species, never evolved with the ability to see the impact of their actions in the future, past their current situation. Normally this isn't a problem, because, like every other animal, reproduction will find a natural balance and if too much reproduction happens, there are not enough resources, and the species will die off until there are enough resources to sustain them.

Now humans of course are much more intelligent than the majority of other animals, so they have been able to avoid this eventuality with new technologies, primarily agriculture.

But here's the problem: Because humans don't have an instinct to see the impact of their actions in the future, they will never learn. Just take a look at the [famines of ethiopia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famines_in_Ethiopia). For 500 years there have been relentless famines throughout that place, and famine after famine, people just don't learn. They have likely seen their loved ones, their children starve to death but they do not learn. They continue to reproduce, outstrip their food supply, die off, then start the cycle again. Because their instincts tell them to. If the Ethiopians would have limited their population to maybe 500,000 after the first famine, then they would have more agricultural land than they need, and would have plentiful food supply.

Even if society collapsed and only 10 million humans survived, we would end up right in the same place, because people do not learn.",null,0,null,1428249467,null,0,false,0,cq1zxxo,null,t3_31i4p5,null,t1_cq1zxxo,null,t1_cq1yyhg,null,null,null,1432209500,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Edit:  The OP really is taking this quote out of context.

Tesla do, with good reasons.

Car manufacturers want geographic reach without investing too much money and local knowledge so they push the financial risk to local car dealers instead.

You have to keep in mind a car dealership is a bundled service, which includes:

* showroom and test driving

* actual car buying

* servicing

* parts/accessories

* financing

There are people who use the car dealer for all of the above because it's all bundled in for convenience.

The controversy here is that it's raising the (default) speed limit without regard for the fact that in the B-road category you get everything from ""almost an A-road"" down to ""last resurfaced 1956, all blind T-junctions"". Obviously, the latter category are probably not safe to barrel down in an HGV at 50.

The alternative here would be to have undertaken a proper review of speed limits, and selectively raised them on roads which would have remained safe, but left them where they are on the older, narrower roads where the case isn't there. However, this doesn't fit well with Pickles' bonfire of regulations strategy, and so an opportunity to have delivered a policy that benefits everyone (increased speed limits in some places, equivalent safety) was passed up in favour of one which allowed for more lectern-thumping. 

By doing things this way, Pickles, McLaughlin and the DfT also dodged the prospect of a speed limit review coming back and going ""actually a lot of the roads are in a very sorry state, and the lack of investment in things like better junctions is hurting capacity and safety, and we can't really recommend raising many speed limits at all"", and making them look silly. 

There's also the side that this is basically a giveaway to haulage firms (always big Tory backers) at election time, and so is worthy of being looked on with gentle suspicion: the timing a month before the election is certainly quite sneaky (it could easily have been deferred an extra month, or brought in on January 1st as is often the case for changes like this).

As an engine goes faster the efficiency of the engine increases.  Think of it like pushing a heavy shopping trolley in a super market, it can be hard to start it rolling but once it's going, getting it to go faster becomes easier and easier.  It's actually easier to have it going at a fair speed then it is to have it going slowly, due to the initial inertia.  Well cars and lorries are exactly the same.  However unfortunately as a vehicle goes faster the air resistance increases.  If I Remember Correctly as the speed doubles the air resistance increases by the square.  Which means that there is a ""sweet spot"" where the fuel efficiency and hence emissions is improved by greater speed but the negative effects of air resistance haven't cancelled the increased speed.  The speed does vary for different vehicles but for cars is usually about 55 MPH.  Which is why the US speed limit was 55 and one of the tests for MPG is at 55MPH.Please bare in mind though that lorries have far more drag and European lorries have more drag than American lorries.

So we can fill the NHS with doctors from the commonwealth instead of discriminating against them in order to try and keep migrant numbers low as a result of open-door EU migration. 

So we dont see strain on every single public service from schools to GPs.

Why not improve immigration further by having a policy that controls quality and quantity?

Also, Farage didn't blame the collapse on the NHS on foreigners with HIV, he made a point about health tourism and used that as a particular example. By the way, it was also factually accurate. 7000 people are diagnosed in the UK every year with HIV and 60% of them are foreign nationals.

&gt;im just glad you arent the manager

But do you honestly think that Brendan doesn't understand this? Do you actually think you have spotted something that Brendan hasn't thought of?

Brendan obviously thinks like I do that Balotelli isn't good enough to be a starter and that he was a risk that hasn't payed off. Balotelli isn't good enough to start for us and I would much rather even Sterling who isn't a striker to lead than line than him.

If a striker is incapable of running in behind like you are trying to say then they will never make it at a big club. I honestly can't think of one top striker who doesn't make runs in behind. Maybe Berbatov but he isn't a top striker anymore and had miles better technical ability and a better footballing brain than Balotelli.

A striker not being able to run in behind is ridiculous, it's how they get a lot of their goals, it's their job.

&gt;just because he doesnt start doesnt mean we cant adapt when he comes on! you dont pick a style at the start of the game and just stick with it no matter what

Well done, pretty sure most football fans understand this. But to completely change style once a player comes on is a lot more difficult than just asking a player to play deeper or a bit further forward. Also maybe Brendan thinks that the formation we play wouldn't work with a player like Balotelli dropping deep constantly when it isn't needed.

My view is that you are clawing at reasons to make out like it's not Balotelli's fault, when infact he isn't good enough.",null,0,null,1428253054,null,0,false,0,cq21sci,null,t3_31itix,null,t1_cq21sci,null,t1_cq21c30,null,null,null,1432210369,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Prices won't go up in the areas surrounding grammar schools meaning that those in poor areas still have access to them and the chance to get into them. There will always be the factor of coaching, but you don't need coaching to get in. I got in without coaching, my parents both passed the 11+ without coaching, so did many other people I know. It's not as big a factor as you think.

Some kids are naturally intelligent and will pass whatever their circumstances. There are measures that have to be taken in their first step of education, like identifying intelligent children early and giving them advanced classes in English, maths &amp; reading, which my primary school did reasonably well. But ultimately it is down to the parents as much as schools. There should be raised awareness of the importance of bed time reading and such. The government can only do so much. 

Even so you did not address my point that comprehensives, rather than help the lower students get pulled up, actually pull the brightest students down. I witnessed this first hand with many friends. One from an affluent family (doctor &amp; lawyer as parents), who was trilingual, predicted straight A-stars at GCSE, ended up getting ""in"" with the stoner kids and got kicked out before he finished his GCSEs. Others who were initially very bright and talented ended up getting mediocre results and going to mediocre universities when they could've done much better.

No, that is extreme and outdated interpretations of Christianity, I'd argue it has little to do with religion. I'd argue that the majority of normal Christians today do not have homophobic beliefs.  Also, 50 years ago the majority of *people* regardless of religion, were homophobic and racist. The country was Christian then, and is Christian now. 

Christianity today is much much different than what it was 50 years ago, or hundreds of years ago. Same with most religions. Look at Ireland, they still have a Protestant/Catholic divide, but it's not like there are large scale acts of violence due to religious beliefs. 

This country is a culturally, and somewhat religiously Christian country. We still have Church of England schools. We also have many Christian holidays.

A recent LSE study found that the selection yields no mobility advantage of any kind to children from any particular origins and more so they found that any assistance to low-origin children provided by grammar schools is cancelled out by the hindrance suffered by those who attended secondary moderns. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21361903

Although, data here is quite scarce but only 2.7% of grammar school students in England are entitled to free school meals - which is the standard measure of social deprivation - whereas the national average for normal schools it 18%. http://www.suttontrust.com/researcharchive/poor-grammar-entry-grammar-schools-disadvantaged-pupils-england/ . Does that 2.7% of socially deprived students attending grammar schools justify selection?

In areas with selection, 66% of children who achieve level 5 in both English and Maths at Key Stage 2 who are not eligible for free school meals go to a grammar school compared whereas only 40% of students obtaining the same grades who are entitled to free school meals get to go to a grammar school. 

Selective education works for the chosen few, but the rest do worse than under a non-selective system. You can't legislate for a system in favour of the needs of a few rather than the majority of children. If grammar schools were truly meritocratic then they could provide mobility but it remains that those whose parents can afford tutoring are the ones who get to go to grammar school.

I think the two are linked. As culture changed, so did Christianity, simultaneously.

Runaway Bride should have been in part 2, because come on.
End of Time should've been a little closer to #97.
Idiot's Lantern should've been in part 2.
The Rebel Flesh/The Almost People is at least second tier if not top tier. and if you think otherwise, FIGHT ME IN REAL LIFE BRO.
The Crimson Horror owns and is the only really good Paternoster Gang episode. Should have been in part 3
Victory of the Daleks is too damn high. 
Gridlock should have been in part 3
The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood should have been in part 1
Cold War might have my favorite character beats for Clara, and it has Liam Cunningham AND David Warner. So, forget you, Daniel Sherrier.
Aliens of London/WWIII being in part 2 is a sick joke. ""solid, kid-friendly adventure"" being used to describe it makes me want to chug antifreeze.
Boom Town is also way too high. any episode with a Slitheen is baaaaaad. Slitheen suck. 

I love Kill the Moon, but I can understand almost any ranking for it. Maybe not if it were in the exact middle of the list, because I'm not sure what it is, but it's either really good or really bad.

Because our other central defenders are actually playing well. Not really that hard to figure out.

And Balotelli got those games in the first half of the season, in which we were complete shit. You wouldn't judge the rest of the squad based on those performances, but of course Balo gets the stick.
