2nd year NatSci Here. For full disclosure: Stayed in Keynes for the first year. 

&gt;what exactly is a ""gyp"" room and how much cooking can be accomplished in one?

gyp rooms in Keynes are very... spartan. expect nothing more than sinks, toasters and microwaves. Having said that, a surprising amount of cooking can be accomplished in a microwave...

&gt;are the shared kitchens already equipped, or do I have to bring my own pots and pans?

I may be wrong here, but I believe everyone brings their own equipment. People usually share though.

&gt;are en-suite bathrooms a big plus compared to shared ones?

This is personal preference. I'm kind of 'quiet' and en-suite was an absolute must for me. Never having to wait for people, or have people wait for you is great. Also leaving your toothbrush next to the sink is a nice extra!

&gt;do I have to bring my own furniture, and if so, how much?
&gt;follow-up: is there a difference in size and capacity of rooms between K and SH?

No, not at all. the only thing you may want to bring is a desk lamp. Keynes has nice, big(ish), airy rooms. spaldings are much smaller, and are more.... cave like. Not as much natural light, but still nice rooms on the whole.

Spalding IIRC, is slightly cheaper too. but not by a huge amount.

&gt;will the 2 minutes to the main campus actually affect anything specific?
Well, not really. Work is usually handed in at the porters lodge, so its an extra... 1 min. The only other thing I can think of is parking at the beginning and end of terms. Spading is more limited, and you may need to park at the collage entrance. 


Anyway, wish you the best of luck and etc etc :)
Just out of interest have you gotten your collage parents yet?

If anyone else has further input or corrections, feel free!

Life is about growing up, getting to know oneself. Some people know who they are earlier, some will never know. Me, I did not really like football for quite some time but I started following my somewhat local team when I was at school. Coincidentally, they were quite good at that time. I am from Vienna but my Austrian team is **Sturm Graz**. Vienna and Graz have some rivalry between them and the reason why I chose Sturm... well Sturm chose me was because my parents used to have a house near Graz where we would spend weekends and some more time in the summer. Because it was so boring there, I got to read the newspaper and alas... Sturm was the team they covered most, so I was a Sturm follower. Still follow them but the Austrian league is super boring so I'd consider myself to be a semi-fan.  
  
I also like **Rapid Vienna** a bit because they are the worker's club in Vienna. My family was never really a working class family but I was always impressed with their atmosphere and passion. I like it way more than Austria Vienna. Also, I am politically interested but definitely more on the center-left scale than on the center-right scale, so Rapid is closer to me than Austria will ever be. The first game I went to was a Rapid game because they are in my city; I never watched Sturm in their stadium; only when they played against Rapid.  
  
When my family and I went on vacation to Thailand, I got to watch **Leeds United** in their glory days. I loved the way they played and also liked that they had Australian players. Being half-Aussie, I was drawn to the team but not to the club. I liked Harry Kewell and Mark Viduka but as the team disbanded, my interest fell. I got to watch more football and was impressed with the way the golden Arsenal generation played. I liked Freddy Ljungberg and Dennis Bergkamp a lot. So I watched them but as the players retired, I stopped watching them.  
  
So... **Everton**... I always had a sweet spot for Aussie players. Tim Cahil played at Everton and me and a mate of mine started playing a season on PES with Everton because we liked the team. We liked Yakubu and Saha up front, Arteta, Fellaini, Pienaar, Jags, Distin, Howard and Baines who always smashed in his free kicks. We played a lot with the team. We bought the pink jerseys. We won quite a few seasons. It was one of the best times I had.  
  
Then, some of the players went. Me and my mate stopped playing. But what I still kept close to me was Everton. It was not about the players, the way they play... but the club itself that just called to me and stayed with me. I have been a fan for a couple of years now. I just know now who I am, what I want, ... more importantly what I don't want.  
  
I want a club that relates to its people. I want a club that's bigger than the players. I want a club that does it ""their way"" and has a history. And I don't want shady investors, players who are in it for quick cash, ... I am definitely a born Evertonian from what I know now. This is my club, my belonging and I have somehow always been an Evertonian...

1. Lucas needs to play in the big games. The back four had much better protection, and could focus on their own jobs, which they did superbly.

2. At the moment, out of anyone, I'd drop Skrtel. Slight overreaction, and you should mess with a defence if you don't have to, but he really put us in trouble at times. Lovren I thought played fantastically well, plus obviously vocal; what we bought him for.

3. Gomez and Clyne are rocks. Just....so so so solid. My only slight criticism is that I think Gomez could go forward a bit more, and trust his left foot, but given he's a centre back playing massively out of position he's performing exceptionally.

4. I think this is the shape we'll play against the larger teams, but with Hendo for Can. Balanced, defensively solid, but with great energy and passing as well.

5. Firmino looked good. Did the simple things very well, looked like he had great vision, though didn't go past people as well as I expected. But he'll figure it out.

null,null,JamDunc,eng-yorkshire,ex-Yorkshire now Sverige,null,"&gt;They are social animals that generally work in packs to co-operatively bring down bigger prey as a group than they could as individuals. The only difference between a Wolf and a Dog is typically the species they look to as their Alpha (wild Dogs reverting to full pack mentality). 

They are not a pack animal. A pack animal is usually family, and very rarely lets outside members in. Watch dogs at a dog park, you'll see newcomers come and go all the time. It's not a pack, it's a semi-solitary state.

&gt;They can and do chase down prey items, can kill and eat their prey etc. The only thing that stops them from doing this for the most part is that they are given training and food. But those instincts to chase and kill are still there, hell they're so close to the surface that they're used as the means of encouraging greyhounds to race. 

&gt;In this particular case, the Dog in question had previously attacked and killed one of this farmer's sheep. Even by your twisted definitions, this dog was a full blown predator with form.

I thought anecdotal evidence of one person/dog wasn't liked here. One dog does not make a rule. The majority of dogs do not know the full cycle to be a hunter/predator. The hunt, the chase, the kill, the eating. They can do one, they can do some, but most dogs have had the full cycle bred out of them.

&gt;Even if this were true, which it isn't, that alone is more than enough on its own to kill sheep.

I never said it wasn't.

&gt;Have you ever even owned a dog? Even something as small and cute as a Yorkshire Terrier will absolutely destroy a rat or mouse if given the chance. Hell, its what they were bred to do originally. 

I currently own a Labradoodle (Skye), and in my local dog park, we have all breeds, from a Husky (Skye's 'best friend'), to Yorkshire Terriers, to Greyhounds to South American street dogs.

The Yorkshire Terrier was bred as a ratter for the factories and mills of Yorkshire. It's whole genetic structure was to go and kill rats/mice about the machinery, hence it's small size. It didn't eat the rats/mice, it just killed them.

A border collie doesn't usually chase and attack sheep. We've bred certain dogs with certain characteristics. We've got rid of the hunter parts we don't need and kept the ones we do.

As for definition, here is prey - ""an animal that is hunted and killed by another for food"".

So I stand by my statement. Dog's chase, and sometimes kill but they don't naturally prey on anything.

Culturally, as everybody has said, there's almost no allegiance in Britain to Norman or earlier ethnic origin. From what I understand, that was pretty much gone by the 13th century. 

One possible exception is the Viking cultural associations are kept up quite strongly in Orkney, Shetland and a very few other parts of Northern Scotland. The most obvious manifestation is the [Up Helly Aa](http://www.uphellyaa.org/) festival. However, that's quite a unique history, with Shetland only finally joining the Kingdom of Scotland in the 1470s.

In England, the Anglo-Norman identity was really unified under the Plantagenet kings, essentially with the Norman invaders being subsumed into an aristocratic English identity. The English began to identify as a unified whole, contrasting themselves to the French (and somewhat to the Scots, Welsh and Irish) rather than internal divisions. If you read the [Magna Carta](http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/magna-carta-english-translation) from 1215, you'll notice that while it's concerned with the aristocratic privileges of barons and knights, and many of those named have Norman names, it's not drawing any distinction between them and other English in the way it does with the Welsh and Scots. Today you won't find anybody other than a few eccentrics who claim to recognise or care about any distinction of origin.

Scottish identity is a little different, in addition to the Orkney/Shetland example, there was a strong contrast between the Scots speaking lowlanders and Gaels that persisted for quite some time (to some extent, to the present day, for the tiny remaining population who speak Gaelic as a mother tongue). Arguably, that's a distinction between ""Saxon"" invaders and Celts, but I doubt they would have identified in quite that way. The romanticisation of the Highlanders by Scott, and associated embrace of Highland style by Victorians was probably the last straw in the strong distinction between Highlanders and Lowlanders. Today you'll see Gaelic street names in Edinburgh, despite historically the language (almost) never having been spoken in that region. The Highland style (tartans, kilts) and the Gaelic language have become inherent parts of a general Scottish identity, whereas an 18th century lowlander would have seen them as signs of the ""other"", an embarrassing neighbour prone to thievery with poor hygiene and no education.

Thank you for showing yourself to be a total sexist.

&gt;What makes you think that's untrue?

Because it has very little scientific backing, and since I don't see women as delicate flowers who need white-knights to help them I believe women can deal with 'bad words' just as well as men can. The amount of misogyny in society is highly over-exaggerated.  Women are now out earning men in their 20's and 30's, they're out-learning them in schools and outnumbering them in universities, sounds like a pretty lame patriarchy we're living in buddy.

&gt;What makes you think that's untrue?

What makes it think it's true?  Again people get into a frenzy when women drink the same amount as men, smoke as much as men, experience violence at the same rate as men, (you're more likely to be murdered or a victim of violent crime as a man), or start to be punished in the legal system at the same rate as men, despite the blazingly obvious that men do or experience these things all the time and have for years.  It's obvious when you look at the rates of men in prison and the amount of people with mental health problems, often severe ones.

&gt;Men and women attempt suicide at roughly the same rate.

There's actually no recorded evidence on the NHS collected data, the NHS collects reasons for visits (including self inflicted injury) but don't differentiate on sex within the actual reasons for visiting a&amp;e, only by genders visiting overall.  Again if men and women are attempting suicide at the same rate it can stand to reason that they are experiencing mental distress to the point of attempting suicide at the same rates, but hey thanks for conceding a point to me, that's big of you. 

&gt;Men are more likely to succeed

And that's OK by you then?  I mean they're no longer around to be 'brocalists' and 'whining MRA's' anyway.  The amount of absolute uncaring by some people is just disgusting and offensive, there's no way in hell I'd say, 'well it's OK because women are just more successful' were the statistics reversed, I'd be a decent human being and try and find ways to reduce that level since I don't want anyone to die like that.

&gt;choose hanging (statistically the most effective way of committing suicide)

&gt;there's no reason to believe that women make their attempts as a 'cry for help', either

Maybe not, on the other hand if hanging is clearly the most effective method, and one you recommend, then I don't think men have a evolutionary built in superiority in the forming make shift nooses.

STATS: http://lostallhope.com/suicide-statistics/england-wales-methods-suicide (18+ only) compiled from ONS.


&gt;Therefore, the MRA-favourite stat about male suicide rates is a red herring.

Because those men aren't really dead, I assume you think.  Since the Stats don't lie, I don't detect any red herrings, and not all suicides by either sex are successful.

Thanks for providing the silly little gif, from an unrelated movie, about an unrelated subject, would have looked better on tumblr though.  Pro-tip:gifs aren't facts.

&gt;I find the prevalence of brocialists among Corbyn supporters amusing. And worrying, obviously.

Since I'm criticising one of Corbyns policies, I'm clearly not a 'Corbyn supporter', quite the opposite.  I find the amount of rad-fems and amateur identity politicians even more worrying.  I find you worrying.

Just trying to ensure all people regardless of gender, sexuality, ethnicity and background can access support and live happily doesn't make me an MRA (I'm not) it makes me someone who wants to make sure all people can be happy and succeed and don't want certain groups aren't left behind, even if they're men, because that's not a society I want to live in.

I disagree though that it's expensive to eat well. Vegetables make for a very cheap diet indeed. It's when you try to include decent quality meat that the costs go up. But if you can buy a packet of burgers for ¬£1, you'd be wise not to inspect the contents too closely...

They come across so desperate to beat SF that they almost seem keen for the IRA to come back in order to banish SF out of Stormont as part of the GF agreement, which we all know  simply just won't happen. Never again will Northern Ireland govern itself (no matter how dysfunctional) without nationalist representation. 
Unionism is scaremongering once again without substantiation and lets face it, Peter Robinson goes back on his word more times than Sepp Blatter. Maybe he'll take the ""I'll resign"" path again like he did with the OTR letters saga. 

Try not to get caught up in the nitty-gritty and look at the bigger picture. 1000s have died here in the past 40 odd years and Westminster couldn't give a shit, so 2 murders of ex-IRA men will not put the peace process in jeopardy no matter how much noise political leaders make.

This cuts down a lot of user error because the machine knows where the user is allowed to travel. This is by far the part that causes the most churn (people mistyping, not knowing how to spell the destination, people not knowing the destination is available from that line etc). When you have a function that reduced user session times by multiples of 10 seconds a physical keyboard becomes a lot less desirable.

Cash machines don't suffer from this because the numerical is only ever used to type in the pin number and in rare instances an amount. There's also an ergonomic aspect to cash machines which is why the keyboard is split in to 2 different areas.

It's not every week you'll come up against a keeper like Cech, and once our front 3 start understanding each others movement better (already signs of it between Coutinho and Benteke) we'll create more chances, which should result in more goals. Pretty fair to say Cech kept Arsenal in this game, giving them belief they could come out 2nd half and get something, if Benteke would've scored his big chance and Coutinho's shots off the post/bar would have gone in Arsenal would more than likely come out deflated for the 2nd half. 

I agree with most of your post, but a couple things I would add are that Arsenal not having their first choice CB pairing made a difference for sure, but they still had 9 first choice players, and we managed to nullify their midfield to an extent. We were under the cosh for about 35 minutes in the second half, give or take, and came out unscathed. There were a couple of loose passes but no massive defensive errors, which is a positive.

I'd personally say that it was a better performance than what we've previously seen, but still room to improve. Pretty sure West Ham will park the bus against us because they haven't got any strikers fit, so we'll have to play a bit different against them to get anything, especially with the physicality they've got in midfield.

null,null,ny-batteri,null,null,null,"It's a two factor thing, but academic selection is pretty important.

Some of the secondary schools are very, very good compared to the equivalents across the water. Far more people want to be teachers here than there are jobs available, and so (of the younger teachers anyway) only comparatively good ones get in. What's really interesting is that a lot of these teachers end up in secondary schools, where they do very good work rather than fire-fighting. That's how you get places like Ashfield Girls, or St Columbanas.

Thanks to academic selection, grammar schools get to trundle along doing comparatively little, with the role of teachers being less pedagogical and more information-distribution. Filtering out obviously academic capable pupils gives a ready pool of guaranteed GCSE and A-Level passes for minimal work. Obviously, I'm simplifying here, because almost all people are capable of academic success, but these are students who have some combination of inherent academic ability, supportive parents, internal motivation etc and will will need less work on the part of teachers. (Typical careers class: so, are you going to be a doctor or a solicitor?)

When you combine the quality teaching with very capable students you get quite fantastic schools such as OLSPCK, which is where I will be sending my kids, should I have any.

Not every school has a kitchen, whilst the vast majority do it is not staffed by people who are well paid or well trained.  They are cooks not Chef's, they can follow a set of instructions and it's usually quite a small team working in the kitchen,  it's also, usually, quite a comparatively small kitchen so anticipating a given school being able to push out 300+ covers of healthy food is REALLY asking a lot. 

Schools are also paranoid about ANYTHING that could make them look bad, we know this from the legion of people who had issues with some fairly violent attacks which schools were eager to sweep under the carpet.  That is not an environment conducive to having a Chef getting inventive with the menu, imagine the headlines ""Children get food poisoning from school"" or ""Children not eating enough due to crazy school menu"" that the DM would pump out.  Yeah. 

And finally budget. The last figures I saw, which was many years ago, had a per head per day budget of about 50p.  Everybody wanted schools to stop feeding kids 'crap' but nobody wanted to spend the money for a school to train its staff, buy in the ingredients and if needed overhaul its kitchen to be able to work to that requirement.  So as nobody wanted to pay more the question became: Who gets a pay cut to afford this?  The answer was, of course, nobody.

[They absolutely are](http://www.kora.ch/malme/05_library/5_1_publications/B/Boitani_&amp;_Ciucci_1995_Comparative_social_ecology_of_feral_dogs_and_wolves.pdf). The only difference is that dogs have been bred and socialised to view humans as their pack. 

&gt;I thought anecdotal evidence of one person/dog wasn't liked here. One dog does not make a rule. 

And neither do your claims about what makes a predator. But seeing as you are demanding peer review... I would refer you to both the above pdf as well as van Kerkhove, W. (2004). ""A Fresh Look at the Wolf-Pack Theory of Companion-Animal Dog Social Behavior"". Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science 7 (4): 279‚Äì285. doi:10.1207/s15327604jaws0704_7.

The TL;DR 

They can, but aren't particularly good pack predators, preferring to operate as group scavengers. 

&gt;The majority of dogs do not know the full cycle to be a hunter/predator. The hunt, the chase, the kill, the eating.

Neither do I, I as a human being am no less an apex predator in my own right with the capability to do all those things. The only thing I and most dogs lack is a reason to. 

&gt;It didn't eat the rats/mice, it just killed them.

And what happens in a situation where its primary food source is denied, or hell, it's just feeling a bit peckish that day?

&gt;A border collie doesn't usually chase and attack sheep.

Doesn't matter what they ""usually"" do, this one has form for chasing, killing and eating sheep. See my edit to my previous post as I added the news story from a year ago where it was doing just that. 

&gt;We've got rid of the hunter parts we don't need and kept the ones we do.

We really haven't. We just gave them a better option. 

&gt;So I stand by my statement. Dog's chase, and sometimes kill but they don't naturally prey on anything.

I'm not going to step up and say every farmer is Gandhi in wellies but your image of them all as landed gentry with itchy trigger fingers needs some definite adjustment....
Perhaps you've heard of a recent campaign to pay dairy farmers more than their costs for milk? Farming in the UK is on it's arse and (as can be seen in the report I linked) earnings are falling for farmers.

An attacking animal, wild or otherwise (dog, badger, fox, whatever) loose in a field can wipe out months of work and investment (feeding, housing, medicine etc.) and possibly even puts the the next generation of animals at risk- A Ewe only needs to be chased to cause it to miscarry.
Until non-lethal means are reliable and/or affordable the best way to prevent further harm is to put the aggressive animal down as quickly as possible.

I don't think vilifying a struggling industry is useful. Whatever your feelings about the farmer, this incident was entirely preventable by a strong harness and responsible ownership of the dog. If your husky can 'slip its lead' at all anywhere near farm land, you're definitely doing something wrong.

""Hi G-censored,

I‚Äôve detailed the position of Avon and Somerset Constabulary on the use and production of Cannabis below, hope it clarifies things for you.

‚ÄúAvon and Somerset Constabulary has never targeted the personal use of cannabis unless that use is in itself creating a more harmful situation and endangering vulnerable people i.e. the smoking of Cannabis around children or close to educational premises. That stance has not changed. 

Avon and Somerset Constabulary do receive information from the public about suspected Cannabis cultivation sites on a daily basis so the growing of cannabis is clearly a concern for many within our communities. As the public would expect that intelligence is researched and when appropriate a warrant is applied for and executed when resources allow. 

We do however target organised groups who are responsible for the supply and production of cannabis on a commercial scale and some of the tactics deployed by these groups can involve the use of small grow sites consistent with ‚Äúpersonal use‚Äù. These sites are taken very seriously as they can often involve vulnerable people being forced to grow cannabis against their will.‚Äù

I did an apprenticeship when I left school at 16. It took 4 years, I earned both a National Diploma and a Higher National Diploma and I ended up leaving the company to go to Uni afterwards (when I wasn't going to go at all at 16). I worked every day I wasn't in college. I worked in the warehouse, on the factory lines, in the offices, as a programmer, helping management. I was taught how to present myself and how to act around others as we were trained on site fir the first two years.

I left not only with a wealth of technical skills, and contacts in industry, but also with proper experience in several departments and most importantly and understanding of work readiness I could never have got at school.

That's what we need. But before you can get that you need successful industry so that it's worth their while investing in people like me.

null,null,orwellsocietyguy,null,null,null,"All trades (pretty much) go through a set of RFQ's where they're sort of checked initially (for example derivatives are run through SEF clearing houses). These trades are kept behind a physical (Chinese) wall inside the bank (it's literally an offence to go from one section of the bank to the other). The trades are carried out by the other side of the bank not knowing where the trade (known as an instrument) has come from but is checked to see if it's legal. Once cleared it's actioned. Often an instrument will go through a computer controlled algorithm (An ALGO) which results in thousands of micro trades - but the overall instrument is viewed as a single entity. 

All trades (and conversations had over the phone) are stored for 5 years. All you have to do is sample dip in to a group of trades - check the parameters (which are all fixed to about 20 metrics) and find out if the bank has been naughty. This sampling is happening all the time in order to stop the banks misbehaving. The banks are/were pretty much being fined for (what works out as) millions on a daily basis until more regulation is put in place (for example the London banks have all been spending fortunes on SEF integration in order to reduce the fines.) Some banks have dropped/reduced the more dodgy/grey area trading such as derivatives altogether. There's now more mandatory laws on how many hours you can work on the floor. If you buy a nice car or a new expensive pad you're investigated (to check your finances). Compliance is now VERY strict. If you even miss a compliance training session you're struck off from working in ANY trading house in London. These are all new laws. Things ARE better, how much depends on who you're talking to.

It's all down to how much faith you have in the system. I personally think it's not regulated enough because the markets are deliberately kept as complex as possible in order to try an manipulate how it's viewed and the fact that UBS (the regulatory bank) is so full of shit.

In the fourth and fifth centuries in what's now England, the rulers changed, the culture changed with them, but the actual population living in this area largely didn't. There was conflict, but it wasn't strictly down Briton/Saxon lines - British kingdoms fought British kingdoms just as Anglo-Saxon kingdoms fought Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. There was no wholesale replacement of one genetic population with another - the benefits that Britons gained by adopting Anglo-Saxon culture (recognition in law and protection, for example) were highlighted by Halsall to be one of the main reasons the cultural shift was so wholesale in areas that Anglo-Saxon elites controlled.

null,null,Ian56,null,null,null,"So you are saying the Neocon engineered wars in Iraq, Libya and Syria haven't set the Middle East on fire and caused a flood of refugees that are now trying to escape the carnage, poverty and misery?

Before you try and say the Neocons didn't start the wars in Libya or Syria - the Neocons were actively destabilising Libya from 2006 when Gaddafi was gaining significant support for the Gold Dinar and in Syria from at least 2005 as part of PNAC's road to Tehran.

In both cases the US, UK and France actively supported, armed and funded Islamic Extremist groups in order to destabilise the countries and foment civil war. 

Iraq, Libya, Syria and Afghanistan are all now failed States with ruined economies and active civil wars covering at least large parts of each country.

DIA Emails: ISIS was deliberately armed and funded by Obama &amp; Hillary Clinton http://ian56.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-terrorist-threat-has-been.html

The refugee counts from UN organisations and other human rights groups tell a story of millions of displaced people fleeing war in the Middle East and North Africa.

There's also Yemen, Somalia and the brutal US backed regime in Ethiopia of course. Not to mention the French/US military coup in Mali in 2012. Quite a few of the refugees now washing ashore in Greece are from Afghanistan.

Edit: The comment by /u/EwanWhoseArmy above stinks of extreme ignorance, and indoctrination and brainwashing by Neocons. So any criticism of Western Foreign Policy has to be Russian propaganda? What about all the criticism prior to February 2014 and the Coup in Kiev - was that just Russian propaganda? What about all the anti Neocon criticism in the ""liberal"" or left wing media before Obama got elected, but miraculously disappeared soon after he was inaugurated in 2009 - was that the Kremlin's doing? What about the 1 million strong march against the Iraq Invasion in London in 2003? I suppose you are now saying that all of those 1 million people must have been Kremlin trolls? 

Why has the Western media collectively stopped calling people like John McCain, Bill Kristol and Tony Blair Neocons? They still have exactly the same policies and views. See PNAC.

The overall objective of PNAC and the Neocons is to destabilise and balkanise the Middle East. GW Bush called it the ""Arc of Instability from Algeria to Afghanistan"". Its been a GREAT success so far - its still in progress. Tens of thousands of refugees washing up on Europe's shores is a highly predictable outcome of this deliberate policy.

Some historians have since argued that Able Archer 83 was one of the times when the world has come closest to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. On this view, the only incident that brought the world closer to such a war was the Norwegian rocket incident of 1995.[12]""",null,0,null,1440499071,null,null,false,0,cuexdn5,null,t3_3iba1z,null,null,null,t1_cuex45g,null,null,null,1441484886,null,5,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

NATO was formed during the Cold War to protect ourselves from the overwhelming conventional military forces of the USSR. 
The USSR is long gone. Putins Russia is not in the same situation or league as the ussr. We have no fear of invasion.
And crucially ***even during the tensions of the Cold War France withdrew from nato in 1966 with absolutely no blowback or consequences***

Even if corbyn who is big on democracy just decided to unilaterally leave nato (which he wouldn't it's just more
Scaremongering).  Our close neighbour France has already left for 40 odd years and rejoined. 
Nothing happened.
You could argue since France joined nato they have seen an increase in terrorist attacks on their soil, but that's another subject.
Basically it's not madness to broach the subject of nato membership (what's it for now we have no huge conventional enemy?)  

Edit. Reddits own ask a historian pretty much backs up the French withdrawal from nato.

https://m.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/22s6jp/why_did_the_french_leave_nato_in_1966/

Secret memos or no they *had left nato* and would only rejoin in extreme circumstances.  Why do you think the memos were secret in the first place?  Because it would be humiliating to admit that they had left they door open to rejoin after suck a public withdrawal and expulsion of NATO forces. 
This claim that the French stayed in NATO is just historical revisionism.
It was huge news in the cold war and put the French on an independent path militarily and politically for decades. 

Edit 2. This from the Wiki entry apparently proving France did not leave NATO 

 *""de Gaulle began constructing an independent defence force for his country. He wanted to give France, in the event of an East German incursion into West Germany, the option of coming to a separate peace with the Eastern bloc instead of being drawn into a larger NATO-Warsaw Pact war.*""[3

&gt; If you do not hold any licence, licence applications forms can be collected from larger Post Offices (form D1) or ordered by visiting the following page of the GOV.uk website here

&gt; If you hold an EU licence but do not have a UK counterpart (D58/2) showing provisional motorcycle entitlement (under additional UK provisional entitlement), then you will need to phone the DVLA on 0300 790 6801 and ask them for a D9 form, or alternatively you can [download an application form here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/d9-application-to-register-a-non-gb-driving-licence).

It's also why I post the match reports from the BBC - I 'watch' via their text updates so when the match is over I put them up here so other people can quickly see how we've done.

Just glad people are positive about the previews; I thought it was a shame that our sub was so quiet, especially when this season is looking more promising than the last few, so I decided to do something to try and get people talking.

If we don't get though on away goals but perform well, there'll probably be a bit of grumbling but no major change.

Agree with this, and I think he would be the first to accept that he ultimately failed. However, what he did do was show that the cash available to improve school dinners just isn't there, and that there was room for flexibility as the kids got more accustomed to the different food. He won a lot of small battles on that programme; just because he didn't win the ultimate battle (which is basically impossible without significant government support) doesn't mean he was wrong to try. He came very close, it's not like he came in and started cooking Lobster at ¬£30 a head. He got kids eating healthy food which was marginally over budget. What's the problem?

That is very, very different from a monoculture which extends for miles in every direction.

It's not exactly a world away. Any issues with monoculture won't be that different between the two.

&gt;In terms of use of pesticides and herbicides in organic farming, I would be very interested in the details. What exactly are organic farmers allowed to use and what are the limits on frequency and concentration?

Organic simply means no *synthetic* pesticides. What they use will depend on what they are growing and where, and there are most certainly limits on frequency and concentration.

&gt;How's the social life at King's? Do most things happen in the bar, or somewhere else?

I'm not really the best person to ask, but pretty good. There's always something happening! every Wednesdays is 'formals' where we play dress up in formal stuff, eat a fancy dinner, and afterwards there's music in the bar, 'clubs' to go to, pubs to visit etc.

&gt;Is it common for people to go between main campus and Spalding, or do most people just stay where they live for chilling with friends?

It is extremely common. Often friends from spading will spend a good portion of the day milling around peoples rooms in Keynes, chatting or doing work. Quite a few people from both blocks work in the bar too (it's more like a common room). 

&gt;Are there any good bars/pubs around?

Cant halp with this I'm afraid as I don't drink much. Having said that, kings bar is fairly good and very lively after events such as formals!

&gt;Are all Spalding rooms as small and ""cave like""? Do you know if more expensive rooms are slightly bigger?

I haven't got a fantastic knowledge of spalding, but from what I've seen yes to an extent. The whole building is quite maze like, with smallish corridors, weird steps and assorted rooms slotted into odd spaces. So all the rooms (that I've seen) are a little 'cavey' to a degree. Dont let that put you off though, they're fairly decent rooms, and cozy looking!

&gt;Since my parents live abroad and Keynes doesn't offer long contracts, is there a good place I can store all my stuff during holidays and such?

Yes! there are storage rooms available with priority given to overseas students. They're not usually full at the end of terms, so plenty of space! All you will have to do is fill out a form.

.


Personally, I really liked Keynes. However, I happened to have the misfortune of being allocated a room overlooking a court that is adjacent to the bar. It can get noisy at night, and the single glazed windows don't halp very much at all...However, Spalding has its own set of noise problems as it overlooks (sort of) a street.

[I may be exaggerating the noise issue; I'm a light sleeper]

As En-suite is important to me, I would definitely choose Keynes again. The large(ish) rooms, loads of natural light, and central location all make it a very nice location! 

Whichever you choose though, I'm sure you'll have a great time! Just be sure to do some work from time to time :)

null,null,miomike,null,null,null,"Good discussion point.  

I agree on the Davis/Ward-Prowse point. People are starting to look at Ward-Prowse and say ""he's nothing special"" but I still think he could be if we'd just give him consistent game time in a position he could work best in - which in my opinion is the AM in a 3 man central midfield. He's shown an eye for a pass on occasion, can whip in a cross if he finds himself out wide, and despite everything we've seen of him in the PL, can score a decent goal from outside the box.  

Davis is really nothing more than a cog in a system. He does what he's supposed to, does it well enough (sometimes... consistency is becoming a problem for him), but has never offered anything beyond being workman-like. For a long time I said ""he's underrated anywhere on the pitch apart from in the box"" because he'd screw up massively in the box; pick the wrong pass, make a poor pass, take a good chance and screw it up massively basically. I think if given consistent game time Ward-Prowse would offer more in every area, and he'd eventually be a true AM as opposed to the jack of all master of none we've got going now.  

However I **seriously** agree with the Wanyama point. I know he was a beast last season, but so far this season he has just been a liability. He doesn't just sit in front of the CB's and help clear balls or block runs, he's started trying to bring the ball forward like Schneiderlin used to, and, frankly, he is terrible at it. Costs us possession so much. He's a unit, we know that, he's a brick wall that players bounce off, but he's not a mobile, ball carrying, pass spraying box-to-box midfielder. Right now I'd like to see Reed there. His energy is something we're seriously lacking in our sombre displays of unimaginative hoofball. Romeu looks to have to mobility to cover the back 4 a bit more, and maybe more of a game-analysing mind like Morgan had to see the interception he's got to make before its played. Then stick the buzzing Reed next to him but with more free reign going forward, a quick, agile, energetic midfielder with nice short passing to bring the ball forward, and the AM Ward-Prowse (who Reed has played with for years) to link up with slightly further forward. That would be my midfield right now.  

As much as I love him, Targett has at times not looked ready for the challenge of the PL. When he played last season he usually looked good, but that is probably because of the protection he was given from the mobile and ever-covering Schneiderlin and an in-form Wanyama. Now he's offered next to nothing, although in the FC Midgetland game I was almost ecstatic to see Romeu make an inch-perfect intercepting run to cover Targett, who is still under orders to go forward to provide our width.  

With that in mind, I'd like to see Martina there, but Martina has so far looked best at RB, and Soares theoretically offers more going forward, where we are seriously lacking right now. So where I'd play him I don't know, but I do agree that Martina should probably see some more game time.  

The attack I feel is stagnating for a few reasons, highest among them is no creativity, but in close second is our absolutely ridiculous, frustrating, and downright stupid reliance on always going through Pelle, which results in hoofball football or playing too narrow. He is always the focus of our attack. It goes through the middle to him, and he lays it off or out wide or something, and then by the time he's got in the box to try to get on the end of a cross or something, we've slowed play down on the wing while Tadic cuts back or something, and they've got half their team in the box.  

I honestly think right now that he just needs dropping. He needed dropping last season, and he needs dropping this season at some point, in some rotational game. And then we can try to play differently. Try to pass and move again, because we don't do it now.  

I hope that Rodriguez can eventually play where Pelle does, because I think he'd offer more. He can still bring a ball down and hold it up, but also make runs behind defenders and create confusion with his movement while other people (Man√© on the wing, Ward-Prowse behind him etc) can slot balls through to him or each other.  

Man√© needs all the game time he can get to create some consistency, and Tadic....  

I'm so unsure on Tadic it's ridiculous. I want to see him on the left again, with Bertrand, and not constantly cutting back on the right to swing a cross in.  

But we lack creativity so much right now I can't bring myself to want him out of the team.... But every time he's in the team he disappoints.  

Koeman doesn't have it easy. That's for sure.

Quite a lot of the money was laundered via London. Richard Perle (Neocon member of the GW Bush administration) was involved in it.

Prince Bandar Bush threatened Putin with Chechen terrorists in 2013 if Putin didn't withdraw his support for Assad in Syria. Putin told Bandar to get lost.

Well, he showed glimmers, didn't he?

If I recall correctly, he had an incredible Euro 2008 and hence Spurs fans went batshit crazy as we were going to get a player with excellent playmaking ability. He was mostly pushed around... a lot, but *everyone* understood what he was capable of. People can blame this on a knee injury and position changes all they want, he just wasn't fully adapted. Even when he did get his attacking position change you didn't see the full Modric experience yet.

I would say it wasn't until the end of the 2nd season that Modric got to showcase all of his abilities. I think he even got a few goals. We finished top 4 and maybe I am wrong, but I think he was given a new contract (let this show the importance of ~~4th place~~ Champions League football).

For me, Modric is even more of an example of adapting than Bale. Bale already had the free kick ability, used to the rough and tough of the 2nd tier, was pacey, and actually didn't do too badly at left back. Bale mostly experienced position changes, as opposed to a new culture. Modric, although he claims he we used to getting bashed about in the Croatian leagues, experienced a series of injuries, had to learn to change positions and take huge hits in a new league with critics on his back, but came back and would make a mockery of big midfielders that would try and take him down. He was the opposite of what Scott Parker had to offer, who would use grit and literally run in circles with the ball. Modric would finesse the ball around players and run circles *around* them without the ball. 

At this time, I think it was dawning on the Premier League, the importance of a player that doesn't always get the assists or goals, but makes those chances even possible. That being said, for the price paid, you could argue he didn't score enough goals. It was around 15-20 in 4 seasons.

Modric is such a great success story, because at Spurs he was criticised and shut them up. At Real Madrid, he was criticised and shut them up.

The Department considers that spending on health services per person was ¬£1,975 in 2010-11 and that Northern Ireland devoted 18.5 per cent of public spending to health.

Baked beans sugar content is reasonably low at 9.8g per 1/2 can, or 11% of your RI. Not to mention that-that sugar comes with a protein and fibre -- which is the oft touted reason for why sugar in fruit isn't bad.

In fact many of those sugars will because tinned beans are 34% tomatoes, a fucking fruit.

Simply, 1/2tin of beans is only 162 calories (not that calories in and of themselves are bad either) ... but are pretty filling for it too.

I have no belief that synthetic is any different from natural, it all comes down to the chemistry, but in practice only being able to use things which are grown is a massive practical limitation on the degree to which you can use pesticides or herbicides. You might be able to grow a field of marigolds, crush it up and spray the liquid on the field, and thereby deploy an active ingredient which you could just as well create synthetically, but the cost of doing that, and the low concentration of the active ingredient you will produce, will make an enormous difference on the practical impact.

I'm open to the idea of reforming the licence fee or otherwise finding a new method of funding but the fact of the matter is that the BBC is an extremely valuable institution for Britain both domestically and internationally. 

At home, even if people don't directly watch or listen to the BBC, they benefit because it forces competitors to raise their game. In the 1970s ITV made The World at War, arguably the greatest documentary series on the subject of the Second World War, but it wasn't created in a vacuum with a big motivation being the desire to prove serious documentaries need not be the sole preserve of the BBC. 

Is there an argument to be had about low hanging fruit such as Strictly and Bake Off ? I suppose so but I get the impression that many who raise such concerns are simply using it as the thin end of the wedge, they'll happily go from saying ""look at this populist rubbish"" to ""look at this elitist, out of touch content, why does someone on minimum wage have to subsidise a documentary about Mongolian knitting!!!?!"". 

Let's not ignore the fact that BBC Radio also massively contributes to the health of the British music industry (and therefore our economy) by taking chances and giving exposure to new artists via initiatives like BBC Introducing who otherwise may not have been discovered. 

I also really strongly doubt a commercial alternative to something like Radio 4 or even 6 Music can work half as well without being mortally compromised. 

Long story short the BBC is far from perfect but l think that it would be a loss to our domestic society and our soft power were we to throw it under the bus.

Typically you need far greater quantities of organic crop aides, as by virtue of being naturally occurring, nature has evolved to tolerate them. As an example the organic pesticide rotenone-pyrethrin (what you'd most likely buy in a garden centre) has to be used nearly 4 times more often than its non-organic equivalent, imidan.

Due to bio-accumulation the impact of a chemical inserted at the bottom of the food chain (plants) increases exponentially at each level. Both rotenone and imidan are *incredibly* toxic to aquatic life, but due to rotenone's higher minimum volumes its overall impact is far more severe.

There are also other aspects such as organic non-specificity and the potential to engineer crops and pesticides/herbicides together, but it quickly starts to get a lot more complicated and technical, as well as not really fitting into organic vs non-organic.

null,null,DejanLovren,null,null,null,"Player by Player review:

**Mignolet**: Solid game, was tested with a few shots that he saved. His distribution is a lot better than last season. He did however make a poor choice to run out for a ball which was headed for a goal kick.

**Clyne:** Had the task of marking Sanchez which is one of the 3 hardest tasks for full backs and reduced his impact on the game to one shot from a tight angle which went out for a goal kick.

**Skrtel:** Made a great interception on a dangerous ball into the box which narrowly went out for a goal kick. Won most headers and was a rock in defence especially in the second half.

**Lovren**: Really impressive in the first half especially, did not put a foot wrong or make any dodgy clearances. Was physically imposing on Giroud and timed his tackles very well.

**Gomez** Looked a bit shaky earlier but quickly got into the game. Was racing past arsenal players and didn't leave Lovren vulnerable often. Great game for the young lad.

**Milner:** Slotted into the captain's role very well. Was a non stop workhouse and created some very good chances in our dominant first half.

**Lucas:** Protected our back 4 very. Made interceptions and broke up attacks early on. Helped us get that clean sheet.

**Can:** Also very good defensively and made good tackles. Made a good early run behind the arsenal defense that led to a good chance.

**Coutinho:** Arsenal fans themselves said he outperformed Ozil. Which is saying something when you take into consideration how much they rate Ozil. On a less wet day his chances may go in but he looked class.

**Firmino:** Still adapting to the league. Set up Chris with a sitter that Cech saved. His link up at times was very good which is promising.

**Benteke:** As always dominated in the air which helped make our attacks more direct with the ability to make long passes to him. Should have done more with his chance but looked like he was trying to be more careful and not powerful.

Yup, I agree here. Ibe was poor last night, but mainly because he wasn't playing his natural game. I assume that was the instructions he was asked to follow, and maybe he can develop that aspect of his game, but for now he has not got the game intelligence/experience to do it, or at least not when being dropped into a helter-skelter game at the Emirates.

I still think Ibe has bags of talent, and I just hope he can develop other dimensions to his play to become a top player.

packing the meat up into nice round balls, covering with breadcrumbs (chicken nuggets) is absolutely no different to cooking the carcass down and consuming soup with bread. The method will differ, say frying the nuggets instead of baking them for example.

When it's really bad, the best way I can describe it is that feeling when your chair is about to tip over, but constant. It's real, it's debilitating and there is very little provision out there to deal with it - go to the doctor, they'll shove you on citalopram or Prozac but you'll have to wait months for your max. 20 sessions of NHS CBT. I pay for counselling and consider myself very lucky to have the means.

That they are considering this at a time when there is limited (and declining) provision to deal with mental health problems really brings home how disgusting and hateful they are. I went to Los Angeles a couple of years ago and walked around downtown a lot because I didn't rent a car. I saw so many homeless people with obvious MH problems - delusions and so on. It was terrifying. The friend I was visiting works in healthcare provision and told me that a lot of these people have dropped out of the MH system because they don't have the means to pay, and they weren't entitled to any state assistance to help them keep their homes. It's fine for the haves, they just drive around in their trucks and don't have to look at what's going on. It made me so fucking sad - these people literally cannot provide for themselves, through no fault of their own, and they're stripped of anything that might afford them help and dignity.

As a society, is this really what we want? Are we so stingy that we honestly believe people with MH problems that could happen to *any of us at any time* shouldn't be supported by our taxes?

**Aston Villa** - Richards. Don't want city to score while hes defending.

**Chelsea** - Hazard obviously.

**Crystal Palace** - Puncheon always plays well against us so him.

**Everton** - Coleman. Was their best player on Sunday. Very good going forward.

**Leicester City** - Mahrez if he continues his current form.

Liverpool - Coutinho. Their best player. Always looks dangerous.

**Manchester United** - Rooney. Even if he's not their best player, I would hate to see that ugly bastard score against us again.

**Newcastle United** - Sissoko. Powerful, quick, direct. Not bad technically either. 

**Norwich City** - ummmm Cameron Jerome.

**Southampton** - Saido Mane. Very quick. Likes running at players. Don't think city defenders like playing against that.

**Stoke City** - Shawcross or anyone else that helps them park the bus.

**Sunderland** - Sunderland are shite but I'll say Defoe.

**Swansea City** - Shelvely. He's their best player and keeps them ticking.

**Tottenham Hotspur** - Harry Kane. Tottenham look weak but Kane is always a danger. 

**Watford** - Jurado. Probably their best and most creative player. Shouldn't have many problems with Watford anyway.

null,null,SoyBeanExplosion,,Labour | Co-op | Fabians,null,"&gt;Because quitting the EU as you don't like their economic policies is the definition of nationalism and secession.

Where to even start... You keep throwing around the word 'nationalism' as a bad word, but the truth is that our party's aversion to it, and the enduring belief that we have no more responsibility to our people than to anyone else in the EU or abroad is the main reason we are facing extinction in England. It has nothing to do with feeling that our country is superior to others, all it is is a recognition that this country is not the same as other countries - that France and Slovakia are not one nation any more Turkey and Japan are. Carry on with your attitude and in the future our political system will be Conservative vs UKIP.

Even if we leave that aside, leaving the EU because it's an austerity-enforcing neoliberal capitalist club, who will (as we saw in Greece and are seeing in Spain and other countries) happily crush the southern European states for the economic interests of the northern ones, is not about nationalism. Ask /r/socialism or even /r/communism or /r/anarchism what they think about the European Union, I don't think they'd have much time for your liberal tripe.

I think you completely skipped a few steps of reasoning, or just completely forgot to use a dictionary. I mean you're right, it is secession, in the same way that India leaving the UK was 'secession', in that that word simply means the formal withdrawal of membership from a federation or body. Again, not intrinsically a bad thing. You're throwing around words you don't actually understand the meaning of. It's actually slightly amusing.

The left's inability to see the EU or immigration in anything other than economic terms is exactly why we will continue to lose the argument. Until we start taking on the cultural dimensions of these issues we have no hope.

Back in the day. Offside was offside. It didn't matter if the ball was played down the left channel and a player on the right was offside but not involved/interfering with play, he was offside. All the new interpretations of the rule have done is to make the linesman's job harder as he has to evaluate not just position but position relative to play.

Digressing more. In instances where an offside player is in front of the GK. How is a linesman supposed to be able to tell by how much they are interfering with play. Perception of depth from the linesman's position makes it very hard to tell if the attacker is directly in front of the GK or 2-3 yards to the side and not compromising the GK's ability to see/save the ball.

One interesting idea is whether you should try to manage this problem by having very high intensity areas, which then allows less intensive, ecologically friendly techniques to be used elsewhere.

Sterling also thrived having a more central role, which most people wouldnt have put him thinking he was a winger. We wouldnt have challenged for the league imo if Rodgers had just stuck to a set plan and put in the safe option. 

Also it is worth noting that the only time we went on any decent run last year was when we switched to the 3-4-3. Can was also very good in general as a center half, it was when he started playing right back he really got found out. 

It is also fine saying Mourinho doesnt play unpredicatable teams, however that is because he has the best 11 in the league so doesn't need to. In addition he has a settled squad of experienced proven players. If Liverpool are going to beat teams like Chelsea they cant generally just match up and play exactly the same style otherwise the better players will tend to win.

It's not about saying ""Britain is the best, let's take back Africa"" or something, it's simply about recognising the existence of nations (distinct from states) and believing that states that represent these nations are the best way to represent their views and interests.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism) offers a decent first paragraph on it:

&gt;Nationalism is essentially a shared group feeling in the significance of a geographical and sometimes demographic region seeking independence for its culture and/or ethnicity that holds that group together, this can be expressed as a belief or political ideology that involves an individual identifying with, or becoming attached to, one's nation. Nationalism involves national identity, by contrast with the related concept of patriotism, which involves the social conditioning and personal behaviors that support a state's decisions and actions.

So it's distinct from patriotism too, and that's another important thing.

A broad swathe of the  British public *fundamentally* do not believe that our parliament should be answerable or responsible to other countries' parliaments. *Regardless* of the utilitarian arguments about the legislative consequences, people would rather have worse laws but ultimately decided by ourselves. It's not just an argument about nationalism or some misguided sense of superiority, it's fundamentally a democratic one - we should elect our parliament to represent our interests and views, and they should be responsible to the ones who elected them - the British people.

The EU parliament fundamentally undermines that very important idea, and I think our party's inability to grasp that is part of the reason why former Labour voters are leaving us in droves for UKIP. It's not just about benefits or economic arguments for immigration, it's a much broader and more important question about how we want our country to be run, by whom, and for whom. We have *completely* vacated the cultural and philosophical dimension of the arguments. All we seem capable of doing is just repeating *over and over again* that ""The EU is good for jobs!

null,null,captf,Scotland,XJ6 Manchester,null,"Braking on a bend can show incorrect assessment of the road ahead. You've entered the bend too fast, and need to take corrective actions.  
You should be accelerating [gently] out of a corner, not slowing down.  
Slowing down affects how much the bike is leaning, causing it to try and get back upright. This is turn increases the turning circle.  
So, because you've come in to a bend faster than your ability, you've made it harder to complete the bend.

Braking on a bend can also be dangerous.  
If you snatch that front brake as you're going round, it can cause the front of the bike to dip. This in turn can cause the bike to lose stability as the back end is driving you forward. It can then result in a lowside crash.  
If you stomp on the *back* brake then rear can slide out as it locks up. That can potentially cause a lowside if it slips, but if you remove your foot off that brake, the sudden regain of traction can be worse, violently standing the bike up and throwing you off. This is a highside

&gt; I'm still not 100% confident at chucking myself round bends

You don't need to chuck yourself round corners. You just want to be an an appropriate speed and gear as you arrive at the bend, so slowing down before you reach it if necessary.

I think we all know that he isn't as good as Dann, but I don't think he's awful. His passing is lacking and he's slow, but he's got a good head on him and always throws himself in when necessary. He's made a few crucial blocks in recent weeks. We also still have Hangeland, who looks pretty solid when playing - he just can't do 90 minutes week in week out.

If we don't go down the young route then we're going to need to spend big on proven players, which I can't see happening this window. Maybe in the summer. I think if we get Ledley or Jedinak behind Cabaye and McArthur it'd ease up some of the pressure on the back line - a bit like when Jedi came on against Villa.

And to be honest I think that might be AP's plan for this season - keep Delaney and Dann at the back and bring on either Ledley or Jedi when we need a tough fucker to help out the back four. Then, when the summer rolls round, he'll spend some cash and bring in a replacement.

2. True. We should be worried about everyone's form when it drops.

3. True. Defenses will continue to crowd Kane. If we can't exploit the space that provides, we will falter. *Edit*: It's not Kane's fault, really. I do think he needs more fitness (or a little more rest before games). He hasn't been as much of a force pressing the opponent's DM as he was last campaign. 

4. True. Nobody should think he means to be a career player for us. He's been quite open about his ambitions. 

5. True. Lamela had a string of five quality games at the end of last season. He needs to do more to prove that he's worthy of a spot. Every window we keep him for that he underperforms, his worth goes down. I also think he fits better into the Italian style and would do well there. I like the guy and I want to see him do well. Especially if he wears yoga pants while doing it.

6. True. I think it'd let Dier focus on being a CB and would give us two definite CB pairings that would be among the best in the league. Honestly, going from where we have been constantly concerned with our CBs to a point where we have a solid pairing of Vert-Toby &amp; Wimmer-DierWolf would be amazing. I'd wager it'd be the second or third best CB roster in the Prem. City's Kompany - Otamendi &amp; Demichelis-Mangala edge us out. 

7. False. He's not worth that much. It also depends on what we're looking for. If we want to play a 4-4-2, I'd consider ¬£21m, maybe 22. But 25 is absurd.

null,null,sittingonahillside,null,null,null,"Yeah it's baffling, it's not hard, it's just pure laziness and an unwillingness to learn. Reminds me of healthy people that buy salad kits, they'll happily spend five times the amount just to save 5 minutes of chopping. Or buy a herb and spice blend, instead of getting separate jars for a few quid and making the damn mix 30 times over.

I'm a far cry from a chef and I can manage it, the amount you can do with one or two pots and a spice rack is staggering.

shepherds/cottage/fish pie, spag bol, chilli con carne, beef/pork/lamb/chicken/ casseroles, plain meat and veg, tomato based pasta sauce dishes with just about any meat, cauliflower/pasta/broccoli cheese dishes, stir frying with sauces made out of just two or three things,  jacket spuds, simple curries, roasting joints of meat and veg, slow cooking joints of meat, chicken thighs and legs with just about any mix of herbs, rice with just about anything, lentils and beans with any of the aforementioned, vegetables like carrots/spuds/parsnips/onions/broccoli/cauliflower goes with almost anything for when you can't afford meat or can't be bothered with it. That's just to start with with no variations.

Nothing of the above needs to be expensive (buy reduced and/or frozen) in the slightest nor do they take long to cook. If they do, it's prep and leaving it alone for a while. Also, you can still eat the lazy stuff from time to time when you can't bothered, like tonight I'll probably just be banging a pizza in. Also, you can cook huge quantities, freeze it or have it the next day for dinner or lunch.

The weird part is, a lot of those ready meals aren't cheap at all especially when buying decent ones and even more so when you're feeding a family off of them, it works out cheaper to buy fresh and cook large meals (one pot cooking for the win) that are a ton better.

Mignolet - 7/10 - Made some solid saves, especially that one from Giroud at point blank. Solid game.

Clyne - 7/10 - Marked Sanchez out of the game for the majority. A threat going forward too.

**Skrtel - 9/10** - An absolute boss, didnt put a foot wrong. Put in 2 or 3 absolutely crucial blocks to prevent Arsenal scoring. 

Lovren - 7/10 - Wasnt as lively as Skrtel but still did a very good job on Giroud

Gomez - 8/10 - Thought he was really, really good. Has bags of pace for going forward (he was beating their quickest players for pace all day) and was solid defensively too. Just looked very composed all game. 

**Can - 9/10** - One of his best games for me. Didnt stop running all day and I was in awe at some of his tackles. A threat going forward but also a rock at the back. Could be our Yaya

Lucas - 7/10 - Definitely needed Lucas for this game. Doesnt possess the energy of Can but was very much part of how we kept a clean sheet. Put in some quality tackles. 

Milner - 7/10 - Brought energy and soul to our performance, a real captain's show. Read the game very well in the first half to cut out their passing. 

Coutinho - 8/10 - Did everything but score, I bet every Arsenal fan was bricking it whenever he was on the ball. As always an absolute joy to watch. 

Firmino - 7/10 - Great debut for him and should have got an assist with that peach of a pass to Benteke. Should start next week for me.

Benteke - 7/10 - As always a phenomenal aerial presence and showed great energy and movement. Shame about that chance though. 


Moreno - 7/10 - Yes he should have passed it but he made the chance completely for himself. After his last two sub appearances I find that I get excited to see him come on. 

Rossiter - 6/10 - Good to see a local lad get some time, hopefully the next chance he gets he'll get to impose himself more on the game.

Ibe - 4/10 - Seems to have gone walkabout a bit recently, ran around like a headless chicken when he came on.

Hey OP,

I'm just going to focus on debt forgiveness. It sounds like you can afford to pay back the debt taken out in your name. As the cards have been destroyed it might be worth phoning these companies and arranging a payment plan in exchange for not having any interest or charges added. You could even chance offering them a lower settlement amount if you can afford a lump sum.

As for your family member, the key is reviewing their Income vs. Expenditure. If they can't afford those debt repayments they can look at debt forgiveness options. Based on their salary, I would say they suit an IVA. 

IVA has less stigma than Bankruptcy. An IVA will get them debt free within 5 years. The damage to their credit file has already been done. No impact on job. 

A Bankrupty could be an option but I would guess they would attach an Income Payment Arrangement to it. That's 3 years worth of payments. Debt wise they would be free in 12 months. A bankruptcy carries restrictions and could affect them if they are a director of a company.

Get them to give Stepchange a call on 0800 138 1111. They are a debt charity and will be able to go through the I&amp;E and suggest the best route to go down.

The most clear cut is the most common form because any subjective approach leaves a large amount of room for opinions based entirely on what we perceive as a viewer, which takes no account towards the tactics/players thoughts we simply are unaware of. What if it's a set play? What if Gomez KNEW that giving Coutinho the ball meant we might score as opposed to giving the ball to someone else? We simply don't know, which is why I feel taking the assist away from him based on what we've seen as viewers feels a little harsh on the lad. 

As I touched upon,  if we're going to be subjective about assists, why should deflections be credited to the strikers? Ie. Pedros goal against WBA - if that isn't deflected, it probably doesn't go in. Why is it being credited to Pedro? Because that's arguably the simplest way of keeping account of these statistics. 

Interesting discussion though, I'm not trying to take anything away from Coutinho's goal (obviously - it was bloody magnificent).

The Everton fans half-heartedly booing Raheem Sterling on Sunday made me chuckle. They couldn‚Äôt make their mind up whether they hated him for representing their rivals on Merseyside in the past, or loved him for angering all the Liverpool supporters by leaving.
Whatever their feelings towards Sterling, deep down they know they saw a star performer at Goodison and a young England international who has made a massive difference immediately to Manchester City.
So far, and I‚Äôm well aware we are only three games in, City‚Äôs football has been as entertaining as it has been effective. That‚Äôs a tough mix to master.

Last season City looked moribund, Manuel Pellegrini‚Äôs future was questioned, and some even thought Yaya Toure was past it.
The one big difference this season is Sterling. No doubt the ‚Äòstatmonsters‚Äô will tell me he hasn‚Äôt scored, not enough assists or other such stuff which matters only in the minds of computer-game-playing geeks who rarely get to actual matches.
Set stats aside for a second and get a real feel for the game. Watch it. Last season it was pass, pass, pass at City and it all became so predictable.
Bringing in Sterling has brought a whole new dimension to City‚Äôs game and allowed his new team-mates the space to express themselves more than they could last season.
Sterling runs at opponents, and he does it with speed and passion.
He commits opponents and forces them to double up on him. If he is running at full back, an opposing centre half has to get himself set and ready to cover if Sterling beats that full back.

All of that means more time and room for David Silva to weave his magic. Even Jesus Navas has looked decent since Sterling came into the City side.
I chuckle when I think of all those who suggested Sterling wouldn‚Äôt get in the City team, using it as some sort of rationale to back up their claims he should stay at Liverpool. Sterling was signed as a starter for City and he has so far made a huge difference.
Raheem Sterling ‚Äì a young footballer playing football, very well. Let‚Äôs see if the critics are prepared to give credit where it is due.

And that's an interesting discussion that our party should be having. The thing is, I don't think democracy scales well, especially in the sense that the EU wants it too. No matter how hard it tries, the UK and Italy and Poland are *never* going to have the same interests or views, and it's not desirable for them to either, because their cultures and traditions and material differences are simply too great.

My problem is this blind, unquestioning loyalty that our party has to the EU. It actually makes me feel a little bit nauseous. It's like a puppy that keeps getting beaten by its master but keeps wanting to make its master happy anyway. It's pathetic. Every candidate seems to be competing to show their undying devotion the EU, and the moment one candidate (Corbyn) says ""Maybe we need to have an actual debate about this"", they take the opportunity to pounce on him. ""Look how dangerous Corbyn is, he isn't willing to swear his undying obedience to the EU!""

And this author comes out and goes ""Look how extreme Corbyn is, *he's not a pathetic little puppy to the EU!*"" But you know what? I like that. I like that *a lot*. It shows he at least has a fucking spine. At least he's willing to say what he honestly feels.

The truth is that everyone accepts the EU needs serious reforms. But the truth is that if we aren't willing to even *countenance* leaving it, why should the EU change? Why would it want to, when there's no chance of us ever leaving it?

The main reason I'd like to go to an English-speaking country first is because if things are rough at first (not understanding how things work over there), at least I can communicate and easily understand folks.  I think it would make things feel a lot less lonely.  I'm also led to believe that people in those countries are a lot more open and friendly than in Scandinavian countries, and that would also make the transition from the U.S. seem a lot easier.

OK, so it is still the same old drum. Yawn.

&gt; Ask  /r/communism or /r/anarchism what they think about the European Union, I don't think they'd have much time for your liberal tripe.

Because those are the influences we should be relying on for the current direction of the Labour Party, literal Communism and Anarchism.

&gt;I think you completely skipped a few steps of reasoning, or just completely forgot to use a dictionary. I mean you're right, it is secession, in the same way that India leaving the UK was 'secession', in that that word simply means the formal withdrawal of membership from a federation or body.

Do you not understand how the relationship between the subjugated, colonized India within the Empire is different from our current membership of the EU? 

&gt;The left's inability to see the EU or immigration in anything other than economic terms is exactly why we will continue to lose the argument. Until we start taking on the cultural dimensions of these issues we have no hope.

You said in Europe, so I pointed out wars in Europe. If you're going to be more specific, I'll repeat what I said elsewhere:

&gt;If we're talking about peace and security between NATO countries, I don't see how NATO has done that. Free trade and movement did that. The EU has been the best thing to ever happen for Western Europe with regards to keeping the peace.

You have a pretty negative view of European countries.

&gt;What kind of right wing rubbish is this? It's Socialism 101 that class divisions are more important than national divisions, and the European Union is absolutely central to tackling these false national divisions.

""False""? You think there's really nothing other than class that separates British people from Syrians? lol. Always find it funny when those on the left try to deny the existence of nations, culture, history and tradition and then get all confused when normal people stop listening.

&gt;OK, so it is still the same old drum. Yawn.

I'll keep banging that drum because it's true in an objective sense.

&gt;Because those are the influences we should be relying on for the current direction of the Labour Party, literal Communism and Anarchism.

Ok so first you whip out Marxist class analysis and then you decide that look at what actual socialists/communists/Marxists think is a bad idea? Mate, just *think through* what you write before you press enter, it'll help, I promise.

&gt;Do you not understand how the relationship between the subjugated, colonized India within the Empire is different from our current membership of the EU? 

Indian independence was a) Nationalism and b) Secession, the two concepts you were just criticising *in all instances.* You were criticising the *concepts* of nationalism and secession in and of themselves, I am making the point to you that you might want to reconsider that in light of independence movements for India and other places. Interested in how you reconcile your opposition to all forms of nationalism with the fact of the Indian nationalist movement that successfully gained independence from colonial rule. Do you support that?

&gt;On the ""muh nationalism isn't about thinking we're better than everyone else, we have a ~special~ nationalism"" - congratulations, you now hold the same view as every nationalist ever.

Almost every single person on this planet is a nationalist to some degree.

Does that seem like a good system? My father and mother both left this country for fear of getting sick here, and my brother simply flies overseas for medical care. I know, on a social level, medical staff in this country, and I know they are doing their best, but the NHS constrains them to provide a poor service.

Leaking Transfer Info

Part of a mutiny against Poch


A couple of assaults in night clubs (one being on a female bartender)
[link to probably the origin of the rumour](https://twitter.com/20TimesMufcNews/status/631551304603668480/video/1)

I haven't seen any proof or a huge amount of details to prove any of this is true though. Even the video doesn't show anything concrete. Just a pissed up Lennon mumbling outside a nightclub.

The fact that there are so many differing rumours suggests that a lot of it is guesswork. But I can't believe that the club would be so desperate to get him off the wage bill that they would publicly freeze him out unless there was something else going on. That just reduces his transfer value and raises a red flag over his head making it more difficult to get rid of him.

On the whole i get the impression that football clubs don't really care about the player's personal life unless it starts impacting on their performaces, other player's performances or the image of the club. Even then they're willing to let something very public go if there's a 'reasonable' defence and the player is important enough. (Think Terry on Anton Ferdinand, Suarez on Evra or Gerrard and his mate knocking the perm out of a nightclub owner because he wouldn't put 'Ferry cross the Mersey' on.) And although Lennon isn't at that level, he is a decent player that can dominate a fullback and keep him worried enough to stay in his own half. He also plays a position that we're having a bit of trouble with at the minute and he could do a decent job at.

The leaking transfer details to the press seems like a very specific rumour and one that keeps coming up. So it could be that, or maybe he had sex with Paul Merson.

Yesterday he was screaming at his own players. The stare down he gave someone following that player giving away the ball (I think it was Ibe) was unreal, followed by some choice words.

He was immense yesterday. He won just about everything and had Giroud in his pocket just about all game.

&gt;If the above is true then there is no gain. You're paying to insure goods you're already paying to rent.

How is there not a gain?  Your rent gets you use of the goods for a fixed period of time after which you are expected to return them in the condition you received them (give or take fair wear and tear).

If the goods are damaged or destroyed in your possession, beyond what might be expected in normal use, you are potentially liable to pay for repair or replacement.

The very first time they did their ""free broadband forever"" thing 10 years ago, they were pretty shit. You could see they were a company straining under the weight of so many people signing up for the offer. When BT customers were getting the BT Home Hub v1, all TalkTalk could muster for their customers was a shitty USB-only non-wireless modem that needed a CD to get working and the computer to do a dial up everytime you needed to get connected. And when they first started sending out wireless routers, their official advice (and the default setting) was for people to use WEP security, this in a time when it had well documented that WEP was useless and the modem itself was perfectly capable of delivering WPA2 AES security! At least the service was 40GB though as standard, a download limit I thought I would never surpass (LOL).

Since then, however, they have really picked up both their customer service and the products they offer. When my router flatlined, they sent out another one, (almost) no questions asked. The TV service via YouView is really good, offering a cheap way to get Freeview channels and still being able to pause, rewind and record TV whilst also being able to access catch up TV too in a pretty well integrated way - I would really like HD Sky Sports and BT Sports as well though as an option. But then, they are going to unveil an offer any day now for Sky Sports ¬£11 for 9 months, which is great, I must say. And recently, they gave away SIM cards with free call, texts and data at no additional cost which is also pretty cool as well.

However what he does seems to have changed this season from last - and in the words of Abe Simpson, what he does now is weird and new, and what he was damn fine at isn't ""it"" anymore....  

That's one hell of a garbled metaphor to say he's not playing the same position/role he was last season, and his attempts to be the box-to-box engine linking the attack to defence are hindered by the shortcomings we knew he had already, e.g. he's not got the best passing range, he sometimes dwells on the ball a bit too long, and he's not the most mobile (even if at times he can carry a ball through a pile of players by sheer force of will it seems).  

If he returns to being the DM that sweeps up through balls, sits in front of the back 4 (in front of the 2 Cb's to be exact) then we don't need to play 5 at the back again and he can just slot in and out of the defence like he used to at times last season. however he is no Schneiderlin, the things he lacks as a CM are in part because of the things that make him such a destroyer at DM.  

I don't want him to go, but I do want him to sort his positioning out a bit, decide what role he really needs to be playing (though that could be down to Koeman).  

Maybe he's just a bit off because he expected to come in and have Clasie next to him (as you said, he played well vs Vitesse, the only competitive game where they've played together).

null,null,RSeymour93,flair8,,null,"The tweet doesn't mention what the case may be, but an educated guess is that this is ¬£22m *inclusive of add-ons*. If I had to ballpark it, my guess would be that we're offering a ¬£17.5m down payment with ¬£4.5m in add-ons. If the add-ons require significant playtime and/or goal production and aren't overly easy to meet, I'd have no issue with that offer. I'd also be fine if the offer is a ¬£19m down payment with ¬£3m in add-ons.

The reason for thinking the ¬£22m figure is inclusive of add-ons? The Mirror reported yesterday that we had a ""¬£18m offer, comprised of a ¬£15m down payment with a further ¬£3m in add-ons, rejected last week"" and that we were preparing ""an improved ¬£21m offer"" which would appear to be this offer. It seems unlikely to me that we'd drop add-ons altogether or jump the base offer by ¬£6m in one go, plus the Mirror's language seemed to suggest that the ""improved ¬£21m offer"" was inclusive of add-ons, and today's offer figure is close to the Mirror's.

[53% of the British public support legalisation](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/02/18/legalise-cannabis-in-uk_n_2712826.html) so it doesn't even matter if the government doesn't agree with it, they need to do it as we're in a democracy. 

Their stance that cannabis is really bad for is just out-right wrong. [A recent study concluded it was 114 times less deadly than alcohol!](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/02/23/marijuana-may-be-even-safer-than-previously-thought-researchers-say/) Not even the chief crime commissioner of Durham [thinks it's worth prioritising cannabis and even agrees it should be decriminalised](http://metro.co.uk/2015/07/22/cannabis-growers-wont-be-prosecuted-in-durham-5307749/). It is banning cannabis that [creates crime because of the amount of money going through black markets](http://www.countthecosts.org/sites/default/files/Economics-briefing.pdf). 

Unlike alcohol it's very useful as a medical drug. Studies have shown cannabis is so useful that it can take the place of questionably-safe prescription drugs in treating [anxiety](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3079847/), [depression](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/06/marijauna-depression_n_6622126.html), [chronic pain](http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/news/20100830/marijuana-relieves-chronic-pain-research-show) and [seizures](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/07/health/charlotte-child-medical-marijuana/). Banning cannabis and labelling it as useless illegal substance that users of which deserve up to 5 years in prison is utterly delusional. I bet the only reason it's really banned for is that they disagree about people using it recreationally, because I can't see any solid justification for it being an illegal substance when alcohol is perfectly legal. This stupid out dated mindset of our government needs to be reversed immediately. While we're at it, let's enforce mandatory drug testing for MPs and those who create laws so at least they're blanketed by arrogant drug policies in the meantime.

your comment here and this one.

&gt;You have presented a really good point though, one I'm ashamed that I missed. Domestic violence is the titular problem and not a problem of genders or who did what.

started me thinking that a panelled poster detailing most of the main forms od DV  (male-female female-male child-parent parent-child male-male female-female and the one that most people miss carer-cared) for would have more of an impact as it widens the spectrum and makes the issue seem as large as it actually is.

null,null,petemc123,,Belfast,null,"The PSNI has been warned to stop ""wiping out"" the police estate, as another 24 stations across Northern Ireland face closure or reduced opening hours.

If current proposals are accepted by the Policing Board, the province will be left with just one 24-hour police station, at Musgrave Street in Belfast.
Eight stations are under consideration for closure while another 16 face having their opening hours reduced further, according to the PSNI.
Information obtained by the Belfast Telegraph shows that Strand Road Police Station in Londonderry, which is currently open 24 hours, is one of those under review for reduced opening.
Ten years ago, there were 140 police stations in Northern Ireland. There are currently only two full-time stations and 59 with limited opening hours, following a previous shake-up of the police estate to address budget pressures.
The PSNI has insisted that policing remains a 24/7 operation and that ""normal policing will carry on"" despite station closures.
Stations under review for closure are: Castlederg, Portrush, Cushendall, Ballyclare, Carrickfergus, Tandragee, Edward Street Portadown and Beragh.
The opening hours of all reporting stations in Belfast, except Musgrave Street, are under review as well as Strabane, Strand Road, Waterside, Limavady, Coleraine, Ballymoney, Ballymena, Larne, Newtownabbey and Antrim stations.
The PSNI said that at the outset of any review of closure of a police station, the district commander will fully assess the financial cost and benefits in full and then enter into a process of community consultation.
Once completed, the regional assistant chief constable must give his approval prior to submission to the Policing Board. Approval from the Policing Board must be obtained before any disposal can commence, the PSNI said.
So far no new further station disposals have been approved by the Policing Board, the PSNI added.
The threat of station closures has been met with serious concern from politicians and police officers, particularly following the Chief Constable's recent assessment that the Provisional IRA still exists.
""I have long been warning that this is happening too fast and too soon. I think it is regrettable, given the need for public confidence in policing, especially at a time when we are told that the PIRA is still in existence,"" said Policing Board member Jonathan Craig (left).
The DUP man added: ""It is important that police are accessible to the public 24/7.
""Westminster is going to have to realise the pressures faced by policing here.""
Ukip's David McNarry warned: ""My advice to the Chief Constable and the Policing Board is take a deep breath and rethink this. This is not the time to be making these decisions.""
The former justice committee member added: ""The public really deserve better.
""In light of recent events the public need assurances and there's nothing assures people more than having an open police station near them.
""I understand the Chief Constable is faced with cutbacks but he has to stop wiping out the police estate.""
Rank and file officers are also concerned by the diminishing police estate.
""It feels like we are being removed from the communities that we serve.
""Our stations continue to close and we have fewer and fewer officers and yet the threat from paramilitaries and crime gangs has not gone away,"" one officer said.
Another added: ""I would be concerned that the less visible we are, the more the paramilitaries will try to fill the void.""
Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin has said that almost all policing services are delivered outside of stations and that fewer people are visiting them.
He insisted that reductions in opening hours ""has not led to a reduction in the level of service delivered.""
The continued withering of the police estate comes as the PSNI launches the first of its cost-cutting Local Policing Teams (LPTs).
Due to significant budget pressures, neighbourhood policing teams across the province have been cut from more than 80 to just 34.

Spoiler; Piss thoroughly boiled.

Fuck me, did an 80 year old Daily Mail subscriber write this bollocks?! 
They start with heavily outdated info from 2008 about health issues (from a study set up by the government with intent to provide the facts they wanted)

That it wont reduce crime, despite it not being a crime once legal, which is the 1st 'WTF are you on about', coupled with some crimes down 50% in the US in legal states.

Then to say it would cause addiction and misuse, despite being less addictive than tobacco and alcohol, but apparently that just flew over their heads.

Then saying despite taxes raised by it, there would need to be more money used on health and enforcement...yeah, that's what the taxes from it are for! What else are you going to do with the tax, that's the point of it!

They talk about people going 'oh if weed is safe, then crack must be safe'. That's only an issue because you've been teaching misinformation for years!!! If you'd taught that weed wasn't that dangerous, but crack is very, then you wouldn't have that issue; but the government have been pushing the 'all drugs are bad mmmkay' shite for years.

And at the end they have the fucking cheek to say use is down, and their drug war is working?? Drug use is up in the UK! And it's at one of the highest levels with people older than 20.

&gt;Of all the things Lamela does well, scoring from distance is not among them. Of his 15 league goals, only one came from outside of the 18-yard box. So when Lamela does pick up the ball, he's best served doing so in the 20-30ish yard range, so he can make the most of his individual creativity. 

Totti played as a ''Mock'' CF, a false nine almost, drawing defenders out and creating space for Lamela to drift to his natural central position and cause chaos. [See here for how they would line up](http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/article/media_slots/photos/001/030/086/RomaTottifalseninevsUdinese_original.jpg?1377707532). People have said (I've seen this a lot on here) that he had 'more space/italian football/blah blah', but it's because of the setup he found that space. Italy is known as a organized defensive league. They're not amateurs and Lamela just can't ''step up''. If Totti wasn't Totti, I wouldn't be surprised if Lamela wasn't shifted more central and not on the RW.

Lamela scored 13 of his 15 goals inside the box, well inside, all from rather central positions. I can find a source of that (a plot of all his goals) if you want to see it. That sums it up, doesn't it? There's a reason he's more effective through the centre - watch any compilation (with us), and I guarantee his best work and passing is through (or around) the central areas. Bar the Burnley strike, of course. But it's a square peg thing - he's a 10, not a RW/Bale type player.

Totti said, quoted, that Lamela is his 'heir', and this is in his first (semi) successful season there. I kinda trust Totti, who saw him day in, day out, to have some authority to say that. 

&gt; Roma captain Francesco Totti‚Äôs declarations are still taken as gospel by the giallorosso side of the capital. ‚ÄúI hope [Erik] Lamela will be my heir,‚Äù confessed the legendary playmaker during the Argentine youngster‚Äôs debut season in Italy. 

This is another quote from a journalist.

&gt;The former River Plate academy product has shone in Europe since joining the Giallorossi in a ‚Ç¨14 million deal in 2011, and during his time on the Continent it's become clear he's a talent to rival those at the very top of the game.

&gt;Simply put, he is one of the few players in world football who can hope to trouble the likes of Cristiano Ronalo and Lionel Messi‚Äîhe's that good.

&gt;He has shown early on that he has the raw requirements for a false-nine role and, as such, can thrive in the No. 10 role

*and, as such, can thrive in the No. 10 role*

I don't think a talent like that is failing because of himself personally, maybe his confidence, but it's a overall team thing. We look toothless, passing around, regardless of if he plays or not. 

Look at Riquelme, a player Lamela was touted to be the 'next' one, a playmaker may I add, not the next 'Messi'. Riquelme moved to Barca, moved to the wing, failed. Sold in one season. First year at Villareal central? Marca voted him most artistic player, nominated (or got in?) the World Team of the Year in 2005 and he's now known as the maestro playmaker. When you think, 10, playmaker, you think Riquelme.

I'd hate to see Lamela move, get time in his preferred, or natural/most effective role, and tear teams apart at Inter if he goes.

Or if you see someone looking to cross at a pedestrian crossing you should notice that.

Depends on the situation though I had one at a pedestrian crossing on my first test that changed from red to green then very quickly back to red, I saw the pedestrian but didn't anticipate the light changing for them so quickly having just changed back.

In that sort of situation it's a judgement call, personally I went for the swift controlled stop and just about managed to stop but would have had sufficient time to burn through an amber, had I been any closer it would have been the safest course of action rather than risking locking up.

edit: In case you are not aware the main options  I know about are

Personal contract hire (PCH): You pay an initial figure (normally 3 x monthly figure) and then monthly for the rest of the term which can be 1, 2 or 3 years. At the end of the term you hand the car back.

Personal Contract Purchase (PCP): You pay an initial deposit which can be as little as ¬£0, you then pay monthly for the car and have a final balloon payment at the end. You either have the choice to pay the final payment and own the car, trade the car in (if it is worth more than the final payment) or just hand the car back.

Hire purchase (HP): You pay a deposit and then a monthly figure over the term to pay off the car. ",null,0,null,1440514181,null,null,1440514589,0,cuf3lz0,null,t3_3ibv0m,null,null,null,t3_3ibv0m,null,null,null,1441487822,null,2,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

The thing is, if there is no evidence for the type of testing you are doing have any relation to what it is supposed to be determining, then it essentially arbitrary, or at least there is no evidence that it is anything but arbitrary in that dimension. It's really not so different from pulling names out of a hat, except its a very stressful process that masquerades as something supported by evidence If we are going to put labels on our children we should at least be pretty confident of our basis for doing so. 

|Never going to happen. For one just by removing the religious |component you're changing teaching style and ensuring many |teachers may leave the school.

Sadly you are probably right. It's not an easy thing to deal with. I went to Methody, the religious component wasn't a big negative, it wasted time, and was divisive, but I wouldn't say it added anything obviously positive to the teaching style. But teachers may leave in protest. The defacto split in public schools is indeed more, or at least as much of an issue. But there being a private public split is also at an issue.

Now I know how everyone negotiating with Levy must feel.

My vote would be to come back with a final offer that is only marginally better-- throw in an extra ¬£1m, hard-to-reach add-on (say, ¬£250k for each year in the next 4 where Berahino scores 15 goals) so that if WBA wants to have a graceful way to change their mind, they can accept the ""improved offer."" But screw significantly upping the offer. WBA is acting like they have all the leverage here, but Berahino has asked for a transfer and wants out.

If WBA refuses that offer, I'd love to make it as clear as we can within Prem rules that if Berahino doesn't sign an extension, we'll come back with a lower transfer fee offer but a higher salary offer for Berahino next summer.

We seem to be the only club strongly linked to Berahino at the moment. Man U's interest has seemed tepid and I have the sense that WBA is trying to pretend there's more of a race for Berahino than there actually has been.

I don't love the other options I've heard, but I'd take Austin at ¬£12m over Berahino at ¬£25m and surely there are some other decent names out there we could make an effort on.",null,0,null,1440514671,null,null,1440515163,0,cuf3wtm,null,t3_3ic21g,null,null,null,t3_3ic21g,null,null,null,1441487964,null,-1,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,-1,null

I think it goes back to my first line, they just haven't been challenged at all as they have ""their own space"" on the political axis so this stuff just never gets mentioned or brought up for debate.

I just despair a bit really, you can't disagree with the Greens long term vision - living within our means environmentally is the biggest long term problem this world faces, but it's the everything else where it just all falls down in my view.

The fervour and zealotry that they have whipped up in their campaigns about things like TTIP and Fracking just makes any sort of reasonable scientific discussion or compromise impossible. It seems to be political opportunism rather than common sense, in the same vein of Corbyn saying we should re-open coal mines in the North. If fracking is proved to be safe (obviously big if) then it would be a great way to move towards reducing our co2 output when compared to coal, but it's at the stage now where enough people believe if there is any fracking at all within a 100 mile radius of your home that fire and brimstone will end up coming out of your taps most parties are scared to show any support for it.

Meanwhile as you say, boring old political parties are just trying to get on and do the dull yet critical every day stuff, especially at a local level and you can't make stories about that. There are plenty of sensible green policies in parties such as Labour and Lib Dems (not sure on Tories nationally given the stuff they've cut post May 2015) but a specific group of people cannot seem to look past Greens. Corbyn might well provide them with a problem now.

As I'm in Bristol I worry that it's going to get worse before it gets better here.

It's very clear that since the Premier League and other top leagues don't have any sort of salary cap or spending limit, teams with the most cash to spend will be the winners.  Chelsea and Man City are the best examples - previously mediocre clubs, now world powerhouses now thanks to a sugar daddy.

Everton had money but nothing on the scale of Russian or Middle Eastern oligarchs. 

However, it does seem more could be done - we seem to lack ambition with signings (Rom was good but that was kinda it), the stadium situation shows a sense of lacking tenacity to deal with politics, and there doesn't seem to be a larger vision beyond creating pretty good homegrown players.

Still, I sadly think Everton's situation is primarily symptomatic of a larger reality that no one still really wants to fully admit - that the Premier League really is a joke in terms of anyone contending outside the top 4.

Well completely agree with you there.  
  
&gt; watch any compilation (with us), and I guarantee his best work and passing is through (or around) the central areas.  
  
I agree again, just wondering why it was he did better out wide for Roma. He has mostly been used as an inside forward though and even then it just doesn't work (as you say probably a space thing).   
  
The only way we have of seeing him as a 10 is if Poch pushes through his plan B of trying a 442 with the second striker playing more like VDV used to in the good old days. Which is apparently one of the plans, so there's still hope. I thought he was decent towards the end of last season, he seemed to have even less of a pre-season than Kane did so let's hope it's just a bit of that holding him back atm.   
  
I really want Lamela to succeed. I generally agree with Smokey on most stuff on him, but he needs to play better to stay. Let's hope there's not much to these rumours... even if someone's not a fan of Lamela it leaves us kind of thin imo.

Paul Krugman is wrong virtually every time he speaks. My 94 year old Aunty Doris can probably make better economic forecasts than he can.

11 times between 2010 and 2012 he predicted the Euro would collapse. It hasn't.

http://www.niallferguson.com/journalism/miscellany/krugtron-the-invincible-part-1

He said Irish and UK budgetary restrain policies would damage their economies and reduce their growth prospects.

http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE3DE1131F936A15750C0A9679D8B63&amp;smid=tw-NytimesKrugman&amp;seid=auto

But wait? These are all now among the fastest growing economies in Europe. Oops.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/05/ireland-fastest-growing-eu-economy

http://dailysignal.com/2015/04/08/what-paul-krugman-got-wrong-about-irelands-economy/

http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32720772

And just for further amusement. Paul Krugman on the internet: *""By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's.""*

The only reason he has stature is:

1. He got a Nobel prize (Big deal. They give these to libertarian economists like Friedman and Hayek too you know. Same organisation gives peace prizes to Kissinger and Obama as well. Meaningless).

2. He tells the left what they want to hear. That public finance grows on the magic gum tree under the rainbow, and there's no need to stop splashing it around on every whim and fancy.

In any case, there are far more authoritative people than little old me willing to call out Paul Krugman as the misguided idealogue that he is, including:

- Jeffrey Sachs
- Niall Ferguson
- Lawrence Kotlikoff 
- the IMF

Plus basically anyone who understands the limits of Keynesian thinking (the man who said we'd all be working 15 hour weeks by now incidentally. Another economist who couldn't predict a sunset).

If Paul Krugman is your lodestar on these matters, you're navigating with a pretty faulty set of instruments.

""Austerity"" is simply a pejorative term for public spending restraint (noone's going about with barefeet, shitting in buckets and queing for their ration cards). 

In reality, most of what is happening is simply a smaller rate of increase in spending than what was enjoyed previously.

But I don't know your circumstances, and can't think of such a condition where you'd be seeing a GP often rather than a specialist, so I don't know.

It does likely depend on where you are, although there is a movement to get weekend and evening opening for GPs everywhere - I've certainly found all my GP practices were open either one weekend morning or until 9 or so one or more evenings, although these were all in either reasonably sized towns or (not necessarily major) cities.

The catchment area thing for GPs is tricky - I see exactly why they do it, but it can be rather annoying if, as you say, you spend traditional working hours in a different area to your home and you're unable to be flexible with your hours. Ironically, it's easier to be seen when visiting somewhere else in the country, where you can register as a temporary patient in order to see a GP, which I've had to do several times and is fairly easy. I have known people to use the temporary patient thing to get round not wanting to move GP quite yet, although that isn't really allowed.

I expect it doesn't help you that GPs are on a catchment area/your local GP type system, while specialists aren't, and most people who need to see someone regularly but are in a different place during the day are in fact needing to see specialists, where referals to ""the person most convenient for where you work"" are easy to arrange. So when it comes to thinking of improvements to the systems, your problem is not one at the forefront of most people's minds, I'm afraid.

The system does work for most people, despite its flaws, and it sounds like you need to be moaning (or filing a complaint) about the constraints on who GP practices treat rather that the service NHS staff provide.",null,0,null,1440516056,null,null,false,0,cuf4r6l,null,t3_3i5bva,null,null,null,t1_cuf1mf3,null,null,null,1441488426,null,2,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

‚Ä¢Milner is awesome, he covers so much ground and is always an option when needed. What really suprised me about Milner is how solid he is defensively. I think we should have Him, Hendo and Can in the midfield 3 with him the more defensive

‚Ä¢The front 3 of Firmino, Coutinho and Benteke really works well. There was a few good moments like Benteke's chance ( Fuck you Cech) amongst others. They seem to have that understanding that we saw with Sturridge, Suarez and Coutinho. They also contributed well defensively as they cut the passing lanes very well and each made a few good interceptions/tackles 

‚Ä¢The Skrtel/Lovren partnership os starting to look like the Skrtel/Agger partnership that kept the most clean sheets for like 3 seasons in a row. Our whole back 4 seem to gel very well and rarely do we see our fullbacks get caught out of position which is great to see after 2 years of John Glenson and the Spanish bombers

Sorry, did you watch the second half? Once Chambers had a good talking to and stopped shitting himself, you looked as average as you are and couldn't even get the ball out of your own third for 30 out of 45 minutes. As soon as our shaky back line stopped gifting you opportunities and space, you had almost none. And then you had the ref help you out again, as well. In fact, anything good for Liverpool was a gift. I can't for the life of me see anything from that match that would make a Liverpool fan optimistic about facing Arsenal again.

As for Arsenal, I appreciate what Wengers done for the club (and I'm thankful that he's losing his touch as Gary Neville and Piers Morgan in particular have been pointing out), but not much more. He was great at improving the game in the 90s, and I would have liked it if Mourinho was to us what Wenger is to Arsenal. Outside of that I find him irritating and boring in the press and whatnot, and if I see his face in that freaky lord of the rings vine with Cech one more time I'll explode. As for tactics, Wengers been doing a lot of bus parking this season while Mourinho plays attacking football, the hypocrisy is very strong - in fact I favourited a tweet recently because it pointed out that when Mourinho defends it's boring, but when Wenger does it he's a tactical genius.

As for the players, I respect most of them, but Wilshere and Szczezny (moved to Roma I know) are cunts, but whatever. Huge respect for players like Ramsey, Cazorla, Sanchez.

My (and most Chelsea fans) biggest problem with Arsenal is the fans. They act like they're the best team in the world but everyone knows they rightfully sit in fourth. They recite the same bollocks over and over every season. Personally I hate them mostly because of how hypocritical they are (for many reasons including ones I've mentioned). Then there's also reddit and r/soccer where most users are Arsenal fans because it's the biggest English team in the States (and they call us plastic), and they mindlessly upvote anything to do with Giroud or √ñzil and downvote anything anti-Arsenal. *And those fucking twitter polls.*

That being said, they're not all cunts. There are a lot of cunts in Chelseas fan base, as there is in every teams fan base. If for some reason an Arsenal fan is reading this and they don't fit into anything I've mentioned then whatever, good on you for being a good fan.

There are plenty of nations where the idea of academic selection at such a young age would be an abomination. And they academically out perform us and the rest of the UK by a large margin. 

The problem with the rest of the UK making all schools comprehensive is the overall quality of education dropped to meet the lowest common denominator, it didn't raise everyone to a new level.

All children should have the highest/grammar level of education, but if you say that here you are seen as naive and just not being realistic, which is a load of fucking shit; it just requires a lot more focus on public education than I ever see the UK giving. 

Look at any country that heavily invests in quality education, it invariably pays for itself and then some in the long run but Trident isn't going to pay for itself I guess.

Would we push Chadli to the RM and have Eriksen to to the left? Would Saido play more of a RF role drifting back to help in defense?

I even know many people who voted UKIP who are socialists through and through - they just did it as a protest vote and because they hated the raft of career politicians they were forced to choose between in the main two parties. And many people who supported Labour in the past voted Tory (like I know one of my elderly family members did) just because Labour weren't offering anything coherent or credible.

Reading this through again, this seems to be an interesting thing to say. Assuming you are not a UK/EU citizen, you'll require a work visa for the country that you choose to live in. That visa won't entitle you to move around the EU and work in multiple countries. If you're aiming for citizenship in the future, it'll also 'undo' your progress towards eventual naturalisation if you move away to another country.

If you do move here, you'll need to fully commit to living and working  in the UK for at least five years before you can even begin the process of claiming citizenship through naturalisation.

And on Britain and Ireland, you didn't show us any growth trends from that period and the type of growth in the context is of utmost importance. Go ahead and tell us about our recent growth but don't neglect to tell us about crisis' in the NHS, about youth unemployment, mass emigration and brain drain, housing crisis' etc.

No he isn't. What was that you said about the IMF, the IMF were early proponents of Austerity and have since accepted it's fallacy. As I said, most economists now accept it doesn't work.

Sex is not the only thing that's better with two. 

When we think of Chelsea partnerships throught the year, Hasselbaink and Gudjohnsen *(featured goal)* is probably the first that comes to mind. 

Over the last 25 years, they are the second most prolific Chelsea duo, far, far behind the Lampard-Drogba combination. 

With a ridiculous 211 goals and 126 assists for the club, it's no surprise to see Lampard featured in 7 of the 15 duos that have connected at least 10 times for a goal. 

The list is mostly Hiddink/Ancelotti's Chelsea, Zola &amp; Friends and bromances (Lampard &amp; Terry, Torres &amp; Mata)

Here's the final selection of the finest goals from the 15 most deadly partnerships :

As to 2020: There's 'not winning' and there's 'going backwards'. The evidence suggests Corbyn will achieve the latter. If we win just 12 Tory seats, we'll have deprived them of their majority, which would be something. There are also several other elections before 2020 (Welsh Assembly, Scottish Parliament, and London Mayor all happen in 2016; the EU elections are in 2018, and there will be plenty of local elections and by-elections inbetween), which will be determined, in part, by what the national party is doing. Even if you don't think Labour can win in 2020, there's plenty to fight for in the mean time. Who's best placed to do it?

Basically, the movement of Totti in that False 9 sort of role allowed the space for Lamela to cut inside and have time on the ball in his preferred, or natural, central attacking area. 

His 13 goals in 15 games well inside the box highlights that. He isn't a Bale, inverted winger, style player. Think of him as more of a...Riquelme, with more pace behind him. Riquelme really is the closest kind of comparison I can make; and I've explained his issue at Barca. They bought him, played him on the wing in the wrong system (sound familar)?, loaned him out w/ a buy clause the first season; then he moved to Villareal. Won the most ''Artistic'' player of the year in Marca and was on the World team of the year shortlist, and became known as the top dog playmaker all over Europe. All because he moved central at Villareal. 

Eriksen is more of a ''take on and beat a man out wind'' player than Lamela, and that is quite worrying as he's a 10 himself. I guess that's why we're looking at Bera and got Njie in. Lamela will try drift infield, and take advantage of his immense creative skillset, rather than playing like a strict inverted winger. 

So the issue is the system, not just Lamela. And it all depends on what Poch wants. Does he WANT to try the system where Lamela excelled? We've looked toothless anyway, without him on the pitch, so it might be worth a shuffle. Kane dropping a little deeper, Njie/Berhanio for pace stretching the defence even more, and boom! Lamela has space. Our last games have had zero pace, zero intent passing, and 11 men behind the ball defending us totally devoid of pace or ideas. That method I suggested would work better, imo. Armchair managing, but I think so. 

He quite easily can excel, but the setup needs to change rather than just throwing 15-30m at players and hoping it sticks. I mean, Kane is now our sole goalscoring threat, and sticks to the shoulders of defenders, but he does drop deep to get involved and Kane's vision and passing is (severly* underrated. What if Kane dropped deeper, ala Totti, drew defenders with him (who will be all over him 2nd season now) which will give Erik the space?

If that happened, I think he'd excel. 

I'm just scared we'll see him for two reasons. One, because I know he has the potential to become that type of player we would have NO chance of signing if he joins another side who play an effective system. And two, I don't want to lose him rely on Eriksen, Pritchard, maybe some youth over all the PL/Cup games. I'd rather keep Lamela, try him in that setup, than sell him for what, 14m EUROS? and try find a replacement...2 weeks from the end.

This is all speculation at this point as we have no idea who is lined up to come in, what system we'll stick with and so on.

null,null,Cheese-n-Opinion,null,null,null,"You're right, and very perceptive! They do sound different to native ears, but not nearly so different from each other as a lot of locals from those places would sound.

  Dialects of British English can be thought of as forming a pyramid, with height relating to social class, and breadth relating to regional variation. Upper class speech is very homogeneous. One wouldn't hear Scottish aristocrat Rose Leslie speak and immediately think 'Aberdeen', for an extreme example! This as a lot to do with their cloistered education, sometimes actively teaching a particular form of pronunciation, and greater geographical mobility. Conversely, amongst the working class you can get quite prominent dialectical features particular to even just a few small villages or half of a town or so.  

  Also important in this instance is how upper class speech was for many years the broadcast standard, and still a kind of passive 'Londonisation' of speech happens to many broadcasters who live and work there, even though it isn't explicitly pushed (in fact, quite the opposite nowadays). Attenborough had a very well-to-do upbringing and so upper-class English is his native dialect, the other two are old enough to have felt a strong need to shift their speech towards this more homogeneous broadcast standard. Although I don't know, they might also have come from more middle class backgrounds with fewer striking regional features to begin with.

If Corbynistas want to encourage polite debate, then perhaps they ought to lead by example.  I've been called a 'spastic' and told I'm peddling smears and repeatedly told I should be writing for the Daily Mail - all for robust criticism of Corbyn.  Didn't see any Corbynistas object to that.  Neither did I see any objection when people hammered me with downvotes for daring to disagree with Corbyn-approved opinions.  (Think the low point was when I got 20 downvotes for the comment 'thank-you' in response to someone who stuck up for me.)

So - here's the deal.  I'm going to continue to say 'Corbynista' until the day that Corbyn's supporters stop engaging in obvious groupthink and downvote tactics.

Edit:  So there you have it - not one Corbynista will admit that their fellow supporters have behaved badly - and yet they all want to tell me how horrible I am for using the term 'Corbynista'.  And of course, this comment will be downvoted, like practically everything I write about Corbyn.

Honestly - I don't have any respect for them.  If just one person replied to me and admitted that Corbynistas can sometimes get high on their own groupthink and engage in bullying of dissenters, then I'd listen to them.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYAf5DuWaC0


My take on this video:

This is purely to push people off of disability benefits or cut their benefits by a certain amount if they get deemed not ""fully incapable of working.

He says the problem now is that ESA (and he blames Labour for this) either deems you ""fit for work"" or ""not fit for work"" so there's no in-between if people can or want to work a few hours a week. And that this can also act as a **""perverse incentive for some people to actually be encouraged to be too sick to work""** Also for people who want to ""stay in touch with the world of work"" -  ""they can't"", because they lose their ESA benefit therefore can't get the support unnecessary for them. 


The problem is this isn't true, the coalition government had a scheme called 'permitted work' which allowed people on ESA to do up to 15 hours of work a week for a maximum of ¬£104  for up to 52 weeks if they wanted to (they weren't pressured), this genuinely did help people back into work, it was one of the only good things that government did in the benefit system (not sure if they created it).

The coalition government boasted about the amount of people on ESA that went back into work, yet one of the Tory majority governments first actions was to remove the 'permitted work' scheme, so this whole solution to the problem he says ""Labour created"" is actually fixing a problem entirely created by this current government removing the system they had in place.

Clearly it's been so successful. It's not as if I could get some weed in a shorter time than I could buy alcohol or anything.

What is criminalization actually intended to achieve? If it's to reduce or eliminate drug use, it's clearly failed at that. If its to criminalise young ethnic minorities... well, it certainly succeeds at that. It's not even far-fetched to claim racism played a *major* role in criminalising drug use:

&gt;""The whole problem is really the blacks. The key is to devise a system that recognizes this while not appearing to.""

\- Nixon

&gt;""the primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races""

&gt;""Reefer makes darkies think they're as good as white men.""

&gt;""Most marijuana smokers are Negroes, Hispanics, jazz musicians, and entertainers. Their satanic music is driven by marijuana, and marijuana smoking by white women makes them want to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers, and others. It is a drug that causes insanity, criminality, and death -- the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.""

&gt;""Marijuana leads to pacifism and communist brainwashing.""

\- Harry J. Anslinger, Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics

&gt;Because if it's a fact I'd like to see the proof that legalisation has a positive influence on crime rates, mental health, physical health, productivity, tax incomes and public perception of safety.

That depends on which drug we're talking about. We'd have to compare across the best part of century. We can't compare across similar societies because no society has fully legalized drugs.

Ade seems to make a lot of sense for y'all. As I understand it, you don't really need a long term striker. Adebayor on ¬£3 or ¬£3.5m worth of wages and no loan fee (assuming something like that is on the table) would be a relatively low risk approach with considerable upside. He's had a very up and down career, performing well when motivated and being a pain in the neck when he isn't, but he's in his contract year and at an age where one big or even decent year could get him one final payday somewhere (probably not in a top 4 league).

You do what Tim Sherwood did. You bring him in, you cater to him a little, and you tell him that he's going to get a shot to start and if he can produce he'll keep the job. You might well get a good performance out of him, both because it's a contract year and because he'll want to do well to spite Tottenham.

If he's a dumpster fire, you bench him and write off ¬£3m in wages-- but no transfer fee is lost. Either way, as I understand it it's not like you need a striker for May or next year, you need a striker for now.

PS: Hope you get relegated.

null,null,Iainfletcher,,Labour Member,null,"Interesting that Corbyn's plans for the ¬£93bn of tax breaks are routinely derided, yet Kendall's identical comments (rounding up by ¬£7bn) get nothing.

I'm not sure playing the Tory game of ""one in one out"" with the budget is a bright idea TBH. For a start, they'll always win in a game of cuts. I think it's poor politics to play into their line to easily as Kendall has been keen to do.

I don't think ""economic competency"" just means ""cut all the things"" to be honest. And even if it did, the facts bear out that Labour didn't overspend and in many ways spent less than the Tories previously had. So as it's not a position people reasoned themselves into, I'm not sure it's a position we can reason them out of. If we focus on this style of deficit fetishism then we will always lose.

Balo was a massive gamble, Downing wasn't really. He was over priced yes. But he was a established PL performer. Balotelli was crap at City and his scoring record was there to be seen. He truly was a square peg in a round hole - he didn't fit the identity or style we play(ed).

I think the anger about Balotelli comes from its huge predictability. He was always going to fail and for the club to think we could be the ones to 'change him' and get him playing was a stupid and naive decision.

I'm not surprised there's sections of the fanbase coming out with the 'I told you so' routine, what's up with that like? They were right and have been proven right. It wasn't difficult to be right, but they were.

The thing that pissed me off last season was fans watching Balotelli play and backing him, saying 'he's doing well, give him a chance, play him with two strikers'...that was the shameful aspect of it all. Some fans were too stubborn and looking through rose tinted glasses to admit he was a failure.

I wanted him to do well, I was excited when he signed but I as many others knew it was a huge risk and a gamble - and I deep down knew it wasn't going to pay off.

Not sure about all this fan boy bollocks, not seen any of that I dont recall.

I don't understand the part about fans would rather be right than see the club be successful? What the fuck is that load of bollocks about? I think thats more your annoyance coming out that anything else.

There were moments in that first half where, _without_ the ball (supposedly a tactic Rodgers despises...which is nonsense), the team looked completely in control. That's impressive against Arsenal. 

In my view, the team is still adapting to Benteke's powers. Yesterday they played heavily on the counter, so long speculative balls up to him were inevitable. It'll be interesting to see how they play against the Hammers on Saturday, when I'd expect the team to play far more technically, on the ground, with great speed. Hopefully we won't use long/direct balls too often in general, even though Benteke can handle them, and continue to befuddle opponents. The more weapons we have, the less predictable we can be. This is what undid us in 13/14 against Chelsea: we had one weapon (possession). Now we can switch to counter-attack more freely.

I've been to Amsterdam three times, its not like I haven't ever smoked before or had some great times with it, but legalising is a whole different ball game. I would not the next generation to be brought up in a country where it is readily available everywhere. Its a much more destructive drug than a lot of people realise. 

Yes, some people can use it, function properly and get on with their lives. But also it can really screw with people's heads and send them into a spiral of depression and dependency on it.

Legalisng is not the answer, but a more progressive stance is necessary, akin to that of the much famed Portuguese idea. Outright availability would be detrimental to alot of people, and put young people who would be much more tempted to take something which they would not otherwise take. Especially when the brain is still developing too - it can really fuck people up at such a crucial age.

Legalising will also pave way for huge companies to market it and create a much stronger product using advanced resources, akin to the super strong stuff you get in Colorado and Dam. Its putting the delicate mental health of a lot of people in the hands of business owners just interested in profit and peddling their product.

And it doesn't really have to be made legal. Its so easy to get if you want some. And police couldn't really give a toss anyway. If you're dumb enough to get caught with it then you have bigger problems than the shit you're smoking.

The money it can raise seems to be the only real rationality behind this. But essentially it is a drop in the ocean. At best that will get squandered on another free stadium for West fucking Ham.

I would get all sorts of things in return, the best was a meal for two in Nandos, Greggs gave me ¬£5 in vouchers (which lasted ages), and similar vouchers for brands like Walkers. The problem was that many brands are ultimately tied back to large parent companies which deal with several. 

The main thing I found was many restaurants got round it by inviting me to come into a branch for a sit down and a chat with the manager (with a free meal thrown in - Toby Carvery). Like fuck that would happen. Some restaurants gave a voucher for a meal for one and capped at a tenner, even if the complaint was very strong indeed and involved multiple people (Beefeater, Harvester). Supermarkets barely responded, certainly no vouchers. Nandos was the best - meal for two with basically no limit, minus booze sadly. 

The funny thing is I had some vegetable bake thing from a company which contained a staple. An actual piece of stationery among the potato and carrots. I sent a letter off and they did a very thorough check - they put it through the same machines that they use which would detect such things for example.

As for a subscription model? I think it presents challenges where the organisation suddenly has to be more conscious of the immediate wishes of its subscribers.

I'm not saying that's always a bad thing but I am saying the current situation at least allows the BBC to feel confident of the amount of money its going to be bringing in and thus it can take bigger risks.

Perhaps instead re-adjusting the rates lower earners pay relative the higher earners pay would be fairer? Again, it sounds good to me but I'm not sure if it would work!

I'm of the opinion that like being taxed for the health service/military/roads the existence of a strong public broadcaster is a social good that gives good value for money.

He says the problem now is that ESA (and he blames Labour for this) either deems you ""fit for work"" or ""not fit for work"" so there's no in-between if people can or want to work a few hours a week. And that this can also act as a **""perverse incentive for some people to actually be encouraged to be too sick to work""** Also for people who want to ""stay in touch with the world of work"" -  ""they can't"", because they lose their ESA benefit therefore can't get the support unnecessary for them. 


The problem is this isn't true, the coalition government had a scheme called 'permitted work' which allowed people on ESA to do up to 15 hours of work a week for a maximum of ¬£104  for up to 52 weeks if they wanted to (they weren't pressured), this genuinely did help people back into work, it was one of the only good things that government did in the benefit system (not sure if they created it).

The coalition government boasted about the amount of people on ESA that went back into work, yet one of the Tory majority governments first actions was to remove the 'permitted work' scheme, so this whole solution to the problem he says ""Labour created"" is actually fixing a problem entirely created by this current government removing the system they had in place.

If you think whites are bad, you should read up on Latino gangs in California who openly murder blacks and drive them neighborhoods.

Here's my big hang up with immigrants flooding white countries; whites are losing the numbers game. by 2048 whites are projected to be a minority in America. By 2100, as per UN projections, there won't one single majority white nation on this Earth, save for maybe Iceland. This may be something you are ok with, but it's not ok with me. You look around and think what's the big deal, these people are nice after all, they don't bother me much. What I think you fail to notice is genocide of a culture and people; your people, my people. You probably view yourself as a ""citizen of the world"" and what not, but they do not. You happily abandon your identity while they continue to embrace theirs. Muslims keep being muslims, Pakistanis keep being Pakistanis, but you happily give away everything that was handed to you by your ancestors. What does being English means if anyone can be ""English""? The difference between us that I simply feel ownership over my people, my nation, my name, my blood, and my heritage. My nation isn't for everyone, it's for honorable Europeans. England isn't for everyone, it's for honorable English. Just in the same way that India isn't for you or me, it's for the native Indians. China for Chinese, Africa for Africans, etc, etc. With your attitude Europe and England are doomed to become one big blob, with no real identity or purpose.

Same principle was there at Swansea too, which is why they didn't implode when he left. Everything doesn't magically reset when you hire a manager. You build on what's already there. If anything it's a club strategy rather than a managerial one, like you see at Swansea and Southampton.

If you can find some smug self absorbent shriveled nugget of diarrhea inside your heart to nurture through the collective judgment of another group of people, your self worth can go up that insubstantial margin of a movement.

Stir that big cultural pot of infighting, pick out the viable targets cheating a social system in place to support everyone in need be it today or tomorrow and mar any recipient with the same brush because having help from your own government and fellow man should be shamed and punished.

How dare that person live on a *free* income, look at them living off of *my* money. Look at that big expensive council house in the middle of shithole estate #9 surrounded by equally well off individuals. What a life of hedonism that fucker lives, i seethe with envy at the very notion of their coasting through success in life whilst i struggle to pay for all these essential things that i purchased on credit. Look they even have a god damn *FLAT TV!* Christ what opulence these spongers deny me.

Actually scratch that, I'm pretty sure by and large the majority of viewers just think ""fucking scum should go back home/prison/work/fuck off"" and stop right there. 

I guess growing up in a council estate barely above the poverty line afforded me that wealth of insight into living that way. I put up with that sort of thinking all through my education. ""Why does *he* get free school dinner?"" ""Why does *he* get cheaper school bus tickets?"" ""oh look, why does *he* get ¬£30 a week in EMA when I don't!"" ""Why does *he* get a full student grant and loan when I can't?"" ""It's so unfair my parents earn too much for that stuff but they *never gave me anything*!"" Living dirt poor on a council estate with other dirt poor people, surrounded by dirt poor people finding the answer of low income is a breadth of criminal misadventures through your home, your car, your garage or your pockets to steal what little your pittance could afford really was worth that free warm meal once a day, that reduced bus fare into school because the 20 year old car couldn't be repaired or was stolen or wasn't able to be insured this month or didn't exist, that ¬£30 a week that went right into the cost of getting into college or the university grants and loans that had no parental safety net or savings to protect me with. What a lucky cunt I and many others like me were.

All I can say is that I'm glad i grew up poor in Dorset and not rougher areas, I couldn't imagine the nightmare of trying to escape what you're born into in a place up north like Glasgow.

You can hear how he says 'chanting', 'dancing' and 'raft' with the more back and durationally-longer ['a'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_back_unrounded_vowel) sound of Southern and Upper Class English. A more typical Mancunian accent would use a shorter and more front [vowel here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_front_unrounded_vowel).  

  He also has a little NG-coalescence, which is also not typical of accents from the North West and West Midlands of England. Again, in 'chantiNG' and 'danciNG', hear how he doesn't fully articulate the 'G' consonant in the NG cluster. Rather, he pronounces an intermediate consonant, [[≈ã]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velar_nasal). A typical Mancunian accent would pronounce those words as either 'chantin' and 'dancin' or else 'chantinG' and 'dancinG' with a fully articulated [g] consonant.  

  Edit: might be better just to show you. Here's my Mancunian (ish!) pronunciation of 'chanting and dancing' to compare.

As for avoiding your point I suppose my approach is to say do you prioritise the right of ITV to ""maximise their revenue"" over the enjoyment/convenience of the viewer who might like EastEnders because there's no adverts and then like to record Coronation Street because they can fast forward through the adverts.

On the general point of fairness in TV media isn't it something of an illusory thing anyway? I mean could one not equally argue it's unfair for the larger commercial channels to have popular programmes during prime time viewing versus the smaller more obscure channels who can't afford to create such content themselves.

&gt; Despite the lost revenue from taxation, money would be saved in relation to administrative, compliance and law enforcement activities, as well as the wider costs of drug prevention and health services.

&gt; We must prevent drug use in our communities; help dependent individuals through treatment and wider recovery support; while ensuring law enforcement protects society by stopping the supply and tackling the organised crime that is associated with the drugs trade.

&gt; I expect that the Government will want to build on the Drugs Strategy by continuing to take a balanced and coherent approach to address the evolving challenges posed.

As far as HMRC are concerned, you currently have 2 jobs, and you're allocating your tax-free allowance to your ""main"" job, which is the one you don't do any more. You're therefore getting taxed on everything you earns at your second job. At the very least, it should be easy to get your jobs switched (just tell HMRC that the old job is a zero-hour contract - no need to confuse them by telling them you've left yet) and you'd like to nominate your other job as your ""main"" job and ensure your tax free allowance is allocated to this job.

If this doesn't get you all the tax back that you've overpaid, there'll be a form to fill in to get a refund, I think it's a P50 but HMRC will tell you for sure.

This doesn't imply that cannabis is a cure for cancer in humans. There have been no clinical trials and the anecdotal evidence doesn't show any proof of this at all. There was also a study showing that, in a different cancer cell line, application of cannabinoids actually increased proliferation - that is, making the cancer grow faster.

And anyway, none of this is relevant to legalising cannabis for recreational use.

IMO prohibition doesn't work. Thats my opinion and I'm entitled to it.
What pisses me off is that while the police continue to raid houses for cannabis farms, they hold back on other crimes. Such as criminal damage, Bilking, theft, burglary ect.
My SO's family home was stolen from, the police did fuck all, came out, took some photos, gave out letters to the neighbourhood asking THEM to watch out for each other, and we've heard nothing since.  All they tell you to do is use your crime number to claim your goods back, which isnt as simple as that when its bespoke items that cant be replaced. 
My number plates have been stolen, they know they were used at a petrol station by my home, they didn't inform me as they told me they would. So when i pulled up to use the pump, i have to be told over the tannoy to come to the desk only to be told my car is barred! 
These are the sort of crimes that effect the normal person day to day. These are the crimes that are causing my life a misery and stressing me out. I imagine anyone who has been in the same situation would say the same thing.
So IMO the police force as a whole need to reprioritise what crimes are important to citizens and which aren't. Im sick to death of police boasting on FB, Twitter, Insta ect about how they have had a successful raid, on a farm that causes no issue in my local area. Yet they cant give me a 30second phone call to explain my plates have been used so i can inform the petrol station.

null,null,miomike,null,null,null,"I agree that he's not done quite as well as we maybe would have hoped. But things to remember include:  

He's still only 20 - how many other 20 year old midfielders do you see in the PL whacking in the goals and assists?  

He has never been given consistent game time to adapt to the league, or simply to get the stats you might hope for from his number of appearances.  

Many of his appearances have been as a sub in the last 15 minutes of games, for Lallana or something similar.  

An injury like his last season, that kept him out for a while and took a while to get fit for, means a lot at his age and need for development.  

When you compare him to the competition (like Steven Davis as the main example) he could easily be far better. Davis has tonnes more  for us under his belt and not that many more assists/goals.  

I didn't bother finding the clips of his other assists last season (mainly because I'm at work and it's a ball ache) but his dead ball delivery (which I know is always harped on about) is the best in the team and I'm convinced with someone like Caulker in the team could effectively win us points on it's own. Then you look at what he can do as just an ""OK"" player compared to say Steven Davis, who has a decade more playing experience, and I don't see why we'd not want him to get game time. At worst he'll stay as he is now, a cog in a system much like Davis, a utility player or just a rotation/back up player. At best he'll find his feet more and more, get more confidence, perfect his shooting and passing, get the experience to read the game better, vision and such for a pass (and he has a reasonable passing range already).  

I know he's not done as much as he could have, but I 100% refuse to write him off yet as ""oh, he's never going to make it"" - because it is entirely unfair to write him off just because he's been around a few years. Most players his age aren't even good enough to be a utility player or anything similar in a PL first team at all.

Have a look at this link to the CAB https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/energy-supply/energy-bills/problems-with-energy-bills/you-haven-t-had-an-energy-bill-for-a-while/

Basically if it's their fault I think you can get out of it if they've not billed you given the timelines, saying that I'm not 100% sure if it applies to you. 

The other angle is to complain, they've constantly misadvised you and gone back on themselves. Write to them and submit a subject access request asking for all data from all systems and all call recordings. You're legally obliged to see all data they hold on you. It costs you a bit of money (¬£10 or under) but costs them a fortune to pull it all together. You can then prove what they've previously said and support a complaint and a case to the ombudsman.

Same could be said for Ozil actually, if Stones is as hard working as everyone says he is then i have no doubt he will succeed. defensively chelsea have been awful and Stones playing with Zouma right now could go a long way to fix that. 

He's not the only young player at Chelsea. A player as big as Cech was let go in order to bring through Courtois (23). Ivanovic will most likely get dropped for a bit and Baba (21) will be the starting left back. Zouma like I said, younger than Stones, only 20 is already nearly a regular starter for Chelsea. then you can add in Oscar (23) Hazard (24) who have been both been starters for 3 years. If it helps Oscar has been inconsistent and had massive patches of bad form for the last 2 seasons but the club has stuck by him. I think Stones has the right attitude, as long as he doesnt turn into an arrogant dickhead I can see him being a starter very soon and hes the future of the clubs defence, hes meant to be the long term replacement for Terry",null,0,null,1440526930,null,null,false,0,cufc0od,null,t3_3icddb,null,null,null,t1_cufbgft,null,null,null,1441491915,null,1,null,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1,null

I think the longer this goes on the easier it gets to live on that small amount of money. They start off claiming job seeker's allowance, then housing benefit, then - because their situation is so endlessly desperate - they develop depression/anxiety/physical ailments, and now they qualify for disability living allowance. 

At a certain point it becomes almost impossible for that underqualified chronically unemployed person to find a job that will pay more than the benefits they receive.

EDIT: Quotes seem to be from the Gazzetto Dello Sport, which I think is decent. It's not a random tweet as I originally thought. 

If it's true, I hope he goes. Only because he'd excel at a club like Inter where he has an attack worth a damn around him. Unlike our attack which is slow, toothless, and absolutely boring to watch.

With a totally unexperienced CM paring, both in their twenties, both with no resal experiences. It's like making a FM side with all the wonderkids, and hoping they might perform. 

Why not call up Marcus Edwards, or some other 15-16 year old player. They're free. We have the stadium to think about after all. Can't do anything but penny pinch right now. I'm sure Njie will turn into Henry for us. 

I think we'll finish outside the Europa spots comfortably, unless MASSIVE changes, i.e 2-3 players are coming in, that can slot straight in. 100%, tag me on that. 10th-8th I think. This late on? That isn''t gonna happen.

So, then Hugo out, Vert possibly, Bentaleb I can see going to a bigger club like City/PSG if he has a good year, and Eriksen off to Barca. Kane won't go, not yet, but this is a pretty pivotal point. Every team below us has strengthened, and some look better on form and paper than we do. 

Ah well, you'll all see eventually when we they finally have a player in Lamela with a pretty massive celing playing at a competent setup who knows his strengths, and doubles his value easy enough. 

He's doing the same shit at Espanyol. First decent season, then just bringing all the youth players, as they didn't have much funds and 

&gt; On 26 November 2012, however, following a 0‚Äì2 home loss against Getafe CF that left the Pericos in the last place with just nine points from 13 matches, his contract was terminated by mutual consent.[11]

This happened. Good times. 

Lamela. Highly talented, square peg, round hole. To stubborn to work around him, so lets just get rid of naturally one of our best players. What a nice day. 

#DeBoer please. Or man, Klopp was gonna go Marseilles but doesn't speak French. Surely we're not far from that rep? Klopp in.

null,null,mrshock13,null,null,null,"I wouldn't go that far. Careful in not swinging the complete opposite way of your initial statement. There is a middle ground.

One of my favorite quotes from 12 was in Deep Breath, when he says that the view of the city isn't beautiful, it's just far away; he prefers it down there, where everything is big and every life so completely important. 

At no point does 12 say he isn't interested in the side characters, especially for the reasons that you mentioned. For example, the man he befriends on the orient express. 

The point I'm trying to make is that 12 strips away some of the covering he had in previous incarnations when it came to his intentions, because again, he wanted to be accepted. But he isn't cold or indifferent to people. He has said in all his lives that he has put SO much work into this planet, that he does care about these people, these lives. At the end of Mummy on the Orient Express, he explains this:

CLARA: So you were pretending to be heartless. 
DOCTOR: Would you like to think that about me? Would that make it easier? I didn't know if I could save her. I couldn't save Quell, I couldn't save Moorhouse. There was a good chance that she'd die too. At which point, I would have just moved onto the next, and the next, until I beat it. Sometimes the only choices you have are bad ones. But you still have to choose. 

He isn't covering anymore for the reality that he'll have to make a choice that may be bad. Look back to 10 and the family of Blood. The people that died because of his choice, but it was the best choice he saw. He is more forthcoming with the reality that for some type of victory to be achieved, he has to keep pushing through and making the difficult choice, regardless of it being viewed as good or bad. Look at his view of Clara at the end of flatline. He doesn't share the enthusiasm that Clara has about winning, because what she had to do reflected how the Doctor has to behave. He acts as he does to spare others having to make those kinds of choices.

The trouble is the corbyn crowd are too quick to write everything off as a 'smear'. I'm not interested in 'smearing' corbyn by implying he's an anti-Semite because I don't believe that he is. What I'm pissed off about is that he's apparently spent his political career giving anti-semites, terrorists, holocaust deniers, homophobes etc more of a voice and a legitimate platform than they otherwise would have. As a leftist, I am convinced that there is some speech that doesn't deserve to be heard and that's why I support stuff like when those nazis were run out of Liverpool the other week; it's called No Platform. I thought that kind of thing was a shared commitment on the left but apparently if you're critical of western foreign policy you get more leeway. This is wrong for so many reasons but the big one I can see is that it gives ground to the far right that they can exploit: the left isn't really anti-racist, they're only anti *some* racists.

Sorry, but you are wrong here. Klopp and Dortmund made a great performance in those years and even if you don't like them, you have to admit this.

Low point of the Bundesliga was ~2003-2008/9. Compare the Bayern squad of those years to what they had after it. The difference in quality is massive.

There seems to be some misconception that you can't criticize anything about a team you support, including players who infuriate with their lack of effort and general attitude. 

People have different opinions, it's not like people are loudly booing Mario when he's on the pitch. A place like reddit is a place for discussion, including criticism of both players, managers, CEO or anything about the club that all of us care so much about. 

No one is bragging about his failure, everyone wishes he would have been successful but the fact is it's been evident for a while that he doesn't have what it takes, while a segment of fans seem to have kept up the delusion that he will come good on the flimsiest of evidence.

The first is that Labour shouldn't run a hard left campaign because although they might gain votes from the Greens, they'll lose more votes from everyone else. That's fine and might be true, but it is not at all related to what Lucas' letter says.

The second thing is that Labour could choose not to compete in some Green marginals in return for Greens not contesting Labour marginal seats. This is what Lucas means when she says 'local grassroots electoral pacts'. There's an obvious advantage to both parties in doing this; not only will they both win more seats, but they will spend less contesting unimportant seats.

Do you see the difference between the two ideas presented? I know you think that Labour shouldn't move leftward, but can you see why it might be in their advantage not to contest - say - Brighton Pavillion in exchange for the Greens not contesting those eleven seats they would have won without Green spoilers?

In reality, if several people have had the issue they might be tempted to be mean, but not if it's just you.

Once you've talked to HMRC, I'd write to the company informing them that due to their failure to meet their legal obligations you've had no choice but to inform HMRC about the ongoing situation.  It should have the desired effect.  Try googling for the head of HR and write to them as they may well be unaware of the issue.

Ah, I finally get what she was getting at. The problem is that there are no 'Green marginals' there are only Labour seats that the Greens are trying to win - and not doing particularly well in. Apart from Brighton Pavilion, the closest Green seat was 5,000 votes behind Labour (Bristol west?) To do a deal would essentially gift the Greens seats they would almost certainly not win anyway. It looks like a Green plot to try and easily gain some Labour seats - not that the Labour MPs for that area will go along with it! 

And anyway, Corbyn's central appeal (apparently) is that he can win back Green voters to Labour. If he has the power to crush the Greens, he shouldn't waste it by compromising with them

http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/saido-berahino-transfer-west-brom-6317512

&gt;[Berahino was willing to play against Chelsea.] Pulis took the decision to leave him out, citing the ridiculousness of the window‚Äôs closing date before showing precisely the hand he wanted: ""There's loads of stuff going on in his mind and there are loads of clubs, not one but 15, saying things and doing things. I'm not talking any more about it.‚Äù

&gt;He‚Äôd talked enough. Pulis words were designed to encourage rather than to protect, while there was more than a touch of self-preservation in his decision to drop the striker.

&gt; However, having splashed ¬£12million on Rondon, to build in other areas as Pulis wants to do, he needs more cash. He wants a new centre-back, maybe two, and a new winger, but finds that Berahino is his only expendable asset, the only one who will bring the kind of money necessary to rebuild what is an ageing squad. Blaming the transfer speculation and the player‚Äôs mental state was a handy diversion.

&gt; Publicly, Albion say he‚Äôs not moving. Privately, ¬£25million does the business. Pulis' words were designed to encourage another Spurs move, while Berahino has been being kept from doing what he loves, as the club he's spent the last 11 years with have gone public. That's not to say he doesn't fancy a move. He's likely very keen on White Hart Lane, a chance at a top six team and testing himself in Europe - albeit in the Europa League. It won't do his England chances any harm either.

&gt; But certainly, in these PR-laden times, West Brom are winning the battle, played out in front of their own fans, for whom Berahino is the bad guy as the issue moves further and further into the public domain.

&gt; When this move goes through, he‚Äôll be the villain of the piece. Just witness any player who moves on in acrimonious circumstances and view the reaction on social media (currently searching John Stones on Twitter represents a fine example).",null,0,null,1440532318,null,null,false,0,cuffmd9,null,t3_3idgrl,null,null,null,t3_3idgrl,null,null,null,1441493612,null,4,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,4,null

the facts.

We're a 10th-6th (max) team this year, no question. Oh right, Njie is the savior, a unproven AMC in Prichard is basically a Messi/Silva hybrid and Berahnio is literally the next Pele. Obviously. 

Lets be real, on paper, on form, our team doesn't deserve a Europa spot and by that time? Lloris is gone. Easily, I don't blame him, I want him to succeed. Same with a couple others, Eriksen to Barca also. I can see PSG or a team like that bidding for Bentaleb too. But, this is to be expected. New stadium, as long as we stay 12th-6th max, we're okay.

And frankly we are an inherently witty nation. It is not purely down to the language we speak, although I'm sure that helps. There are English-speaking countries that don't have our tradition of ""banter"", or our cultural focus on comedians (panel shows are mostly a British thing, and they make comedy a much more lucrative career, which increases the number of stand up comedians).

It was a bit of a shit article really.

I wouldn't pigeon hole myself to a bandit though, I'd browse gumtree for a good deal, because I'm a sucker for a bargain. I'd consider anything 250+cc with a solid reputation, 40k or below with no history but more if it's been well tended. There are always cheap bikes out there, you might get a great bargain if you pick functionality over looks.

A YBR will feel tiny compared to the Striple, there's downsizing, but I wouldn't downsize that far. I don't really know what I'm talking about, so correct me if I'm wrong, but the thicker tyres and heavier weight of a physically larger bike have always made me feel more secure on the roads in poor weather.

Final tips... if you buy something with a crappy headlight, get it sorted *before* you end up in the dark in a poorly light area (do you even get those in London?). I learnt that one the hard way. You probably won't get something with ABS in your budget, but it's worth considering for the extra security when braking. If you haven't ridden in the driving rain much before, take it slow at first until you get a feel for it and get some good waterproofs. As for road salt, either gently rinse all the shit off your bike every time you come home or consider doing an ACF-50 treatment (read the guidelines).

Back in around 2010 the EDL had the perception of being gay friendly. But they were never about LGBT rights - it was just another anti-Muslim line of attack. Similar to the way they put anti-halal as rooted in animal welfare concerns. The LGBT division was even 'headed' by a deeply racist and homophobic individual at one point to - the Kahanist activist Roberta Moore.

Just look at Pam Geller in the US, who regularly comments about he plight of gay people across the middle east yet says shite like ""the only good thing about islam is that its one hundred per cent gay free"".

EDL also often claimed that had liberal members too by the way. And were in an alliance with British Freedom, now Liberty GB.

Do you not know what the Japanese Right is like? Yeah, within the next ten years, within our lifetimes, war between them is not going to happen. But there's no way you can prove things won't go south in future.

This is what the EU is for - a permanent solution to the problem of war in Europe. 

&gt; It is because EU nations are close allies with shared interests and no desire for war that they formed the EU, not the other way around.

However I'd modify that a little - it's not a good idea *at this stage* - as you progress you can introduce some braking, while bearing in mind that you can't brake as hard as in a straight line, and that compressing your forks will affect your steering geometry. Oh, and if you do it on an old BMW, your ground clearance will disappear and the bike will try to kill you. (And instructors like their old BMWs).

Tip: if you want to be confident on bends, find a quiet country road with a set of 3-4 slow right angle bends. Now go through them repeatedly without touching the brakes at any time - don't even brake when you are going straight. This will force you to approach the bends more slowly than normal and change down before the bend, but you will find that you can now open the throttle more than you are used to and accelerate through them. The bike will settle in to the bend and stabilise - the opposite of what it does if you ride the brakes into the bend. After a few runs through, you will find that your toe is gently skimming the ground - not colliding with the ground, but gently kissing it. Move your foot back so that your toes are on the rests. Don't force the speed, just keep going through at a comfortable rate, and enjoy the slingshot feeling of exiting the bend.",null,0,null,1440534150,null,null,false,0,cufgu4f,null,t3_3iblbq,null,null,null,t1_cuez1s6,null,null,null,1441494185,null,1,null,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null

There was only one at a time, then it would get removed, and somebody else would make another post about it a few minutes later. The kicker is that there wasn't even a transfer megathread at the time! [Here's one of them](https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/3i71cg/chelsea_to_pursue_70m_deal_for_paul_pogba_as/), submitted 3 hours before the megathread with 36 comments, 43 points, 94% upvoted.

&gt; Can we have a meta discussion about what the community wants from this sub? I think it would help everybody involved, especially the new mods, to get an idea of how people are feeling and where things should go.

Megathreads suck, and people don't use them. Just look at the transfer megathread on /r/soccer; it's been there a month and has less comments than the Stones article from this morning.

It'll only be a matter of time before this thread gets deleted as well.

null,null,cubs314,num14,,null,"I think the biggest change that's been made at Spurs post-Redknapp has been our transition from a 4411/442 to a 4231. I'd want us to either go back to a 4-4-1-1 like we had during the Van Der Vaart days or try a 433. I was having a discussion with a few mates and we looked at how effective teams like Barcelona are with a 433 and a lot of that comes down to having a proper 3 in midfield. 

I think that if we decided to implement the 433, we would see a midfield 3 consisting of Eriksen/Pritchard, Mason/Alli and Bentaleb/Dembele. I think this would allow for good control/creativity in the midfield but a lot would come down to someone like Bentaleb being that Busquets type player who is solid in holding possession and could pick out good passes. Granted, Busquets job is made a lot easier considering the players around him, but that still doesn't take away the fact that he's the second name on the team sheet behind Messi. 

I'm a big fan of Valencia in La Liga, and they also play with a 433. Their midfield 3 usually consists of Danny Parejo, Enzo Perez and Javi Fuego (they're bleeding Andre Gomes into the position as well). Parejo is their no. 10 and primarily plays the role of the creator and takes all of their set pieces, a role that I find Eriksen would play for us. Gomez is more of the B2B who can cover a lot of ground and make space (Mason/Alli) while Gomes and Fuego tend to sit deeper in that Busquets type role. If Bentaleb is to become as good as I think he will, he will take that role. 

Up top, I would like to see Townsend played on the right, Chadli/N'Jie on the left and of course Kane at striker. Hopefully we can wrap up this torturous Berahino saga asap as I think he'd be more than capable at any of those front 3 positions. Even so, we still look relatively light in those areas. Perhaps Oduwa could potentially be a solid winger for us, but he's still very young and we're taking the proper route by loaning him to Rangers. 

Going back to the midfield 3, I want to reiterate how important Bentaleb's role would be. We currently lack a true DM, but I somewhat agree with the Sherwood/Chris Ramsey statements that out-and-out DM's are overrated. Now before you jump down my throat, I want to look at how Busquets, although played in the DM role, actually has better passing and positioning attributes than defensive ones. He can control the game from deep in midfield and is able to recycle possession while allowing the others (Iniesta/Rakitic) to do the more offensive work. He is not a bulldog like Mascherano is for them, and although Masche can slot in at DM, his bulldog qualities are much better suited for the CB position. Bentaleb is not a bulldog either. Sure, he is very strong and athletic but we've been seeing that he does not have the true DM qualities that, say, Sandro had when he was at his prime. He is not like a Schneiderlin or a Coquelin that will run all over the pitch breaking down opposing attacks, but he can get around his man and make an incisive pass. He can indeed be that midfield fulcrum in a 433 if we were to switch to that formation. He hasn't had the best start to the season, but that can be said for the entire squad, but I think that Bentaleb will become a world class player in time. Let's not forget that he's only 20 years old and we may not be seeing him at his best for another 3-5 years.

thestudentroom is a great resource for personal statements but be wary of their quality. Rather than using them as the gold standard,  read through to gain an idea of what to include. You could even read ones from other subjects if you're not happy with the business and management examples.

My biggest tip is to show rather than tell. Instead of saying 'I have A B C skills and am interested in business', you could say 'I have done X Y Z (e.g. work experience), which helped develop my A B C skills as well as my understanding of the importance of business in the modern world'. 

Also, as mentioned by ZX-Spektrum, avoid using the word passion. It really is overused.

We're not doing those things, though.

The football we play isn't very exciting. We keep possession, but we don't turn that into clear cut chances. For the majority of last season we were scraping past bottom half teams 2-1. 

I've yet to see any 'dedication to the academy'. Mason and Bentaleb made the squad because the senior players were shit, and the same goes for Kane. Rodgers at Liverpool is a good example of giving time to, and interesting, young players.

Why does everyone keep saying this? I haven't listened to the radio in over a decade and even then I didn't listen by choice. In an age where you can listen to what you want when you want, why are people still bothered about radio? I honestly don't get it. Most of it's obnoxious anyway and I admit the BBC stations are the best of the bunch because they don't play annoying ad jingles every 2 minutes, but still, it really doesn't interest me.  
  
I'm speaking as someone who does have a license, however I never listen to radio, I hardly ever read any BBC websites and the only BBC TV show I am watching right now is Would I lie to you, which I catch on iPlayer so I can watch it at a time that's convenient for me. Quite frankly I could to without the BBC. I get that it's important to a lot of people, but many commenters in this thread seem to find it difficult to understand that that is not the case for everyone.

Well, with Sky you're paying ¬£70 a month and then paying with your time to suffer advertisements. It may not be money your handing over, but time is just as valuable a resource, and your giving up 15-20mins if it in every hour of TV you watch. So you're still paying twice. Once for access and again for the content. Just the payment methods differ. And are just as compulsory. 


&gt;  it was just news and educational content then it would make sense, but since they are creating and competing on the entertainment level, there's nothing that distinguishes them from the competition on content.

Neither fullback offered a lot of attacking bite though. Hill got us out of jail once heading a ball clear over the bar that would've been a goal.

Nothing noteworthy about Gobern's game, ditto Doughty. Attacking-wise it was a real disappointment. JET was a key man but his technique is very...*baroque*. Hoilett...Jesus christ...as usual, flashes of promise but no end product. Was ironically cheered as he left the pitch. No-one could pull the trigger. Edit: Both Polter and Hoilett had two great opportunities and blew it. RGC livened up a bit after the second goal went in, and his most memorable moment was a spin move on a horizontal run just outside the box, ultimately passing the ball wide into an abyss.

Polter is definitely not in the same mould as Austin. I think (hope) his big man play will work better with the first squad.

National governments.

&gt;Also passing a treaty is the most anti-democratic way possible to achieve a supposed democratizing end goal strains logic.

Why? Everything is done by the national governments, just as you prefer.

&gt;The national governments agreed against the wishes of the electorates.

That's weird, because those same electorates keep on returning pro-EU parties into Government election after election in every single country in the EU. [Europeans have also as far as records began had a more positive image of the EU than a negative one, on page nine.](http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb83/eb83_first_en.pdf)

It would, although arguably it would be for the greater good as an alliance with a Corbyn-lead Labour would be more conducive to bringing about the Greens' aims and values than splitting the vote. Politics isn't always about power, and when you're a small party like the Greens it is even less so.

What do we do? What do YOU want? Bera, Njie, and Eriksen behind Kane? 

dembele as the RW? 

Townsend back into it, who is worse than Lamela? What?

I honestly cannot believe Lamela even CAME to us, naturally, he's the most creative and unpredictable (in a good way) player we have. And you've seen my rants on WHY I think he is that good, in certain systems.

What do you want? 

What do *you* think we should do? Buy someone else? A AMC? Keep Pritch, Erik, and Alli as AMCS and buy a CM? Like 

Who? For cheap? Now, 2 weeks left in the window. Any target that would improve us straight away is either too expensive, or won't move. Any young player is a gamble, like Lamela.

This should prove a useful exercise for Ramsey. We changed the team and picked the same formation, and still conceded two basic goals. The conclusion here is that the 4-3-3 we play is defensively fragile. If you play wing forwards with a traditional striker then you will concede goals. Unfortunately today the front 3 of hoilett, reece-cox and polter weren't good enough to contribute goals, and do nothing defensively. It's fun to watch but we desperately need a plan b.

I do have to say tho, the one with Nick and Margaret seemed fairly balanced, and Nick actually reviewed his opinions after having met the people in the show, realising that people can't just walk in and get a job and start Monday any more - and that still seems to be a common mindset on here, that if you just look for work you'll get something, and it can happen, but if it doesn't, it shouldn't reflect on the claimant.

I guess I'm just very emotionally involved with all this, and it's not like we need people showing claimants in a bad light.

It's not the odd show, it's Channel 5 pretty much running whole evenings of it.

I could not disagree more with your 'dedication to the academy' opinion. Pritchard, Winks and perhaps Carter-Vickers could all feature this season while Mason and Bentaleb have become starters for us and their respective national teams within the span of a year. 

In all honesty, we haven't played decent football since Redknapp. Was that due to the players he had? Probably. But at the end of the day Levy wanted a shiny new clipboard manager who would play in the stylish 4231 system and it set us back fucking miles. We need to realize that we're not going to be top 4 any time soon and could easily finish as low as 8-10th this season but that doesn't mean Poch isn't the man to get us back up there.

Liverpool endured a 7th place finish and then went on to almost win the league the following year. United finished 7th and went back to being a top 4 side (granted they kind of just threw money at the problem). Everton finished 7th last season but could very well finish in the top 6 this year.

Getting players to fit Poch's system is a luxury. A good manager adapts his system to the players he has, rather than forcing square pegs into round holes.

Bentaleb was a regular for Algeria at the 2014 World Cup, starting three out of four matches. This was before Pochettino came in. Mason is not an England starter, although r is an example of Pochettino trusting the academy.

What Pochettino doesn't do enough is give debuts to young players. Rodgers gives four or five young players a couple of appearances each season to give them experience. Poch gave two last season in total.

However,the end of that video is rather unsettling. I don't believe for one second that people within the Green Party are anti-semitic (for starters, as someone with a Jewish heritage, I'd be screwed!). However, I do believe that a lot of people are siding more with Palestine than Israel in the conflict; my opinion is that the only way to truly solve the problem is a one state solution in which the political system is constructed in a similar fashion to Lebanon.

I also believe that both Israel and Palestine are as bad as each other in some cases, with Israel carrying out the vast majority of offences, some of which would constitute war crimes and DO deserve to be answered appropriately.

The problem with Israel is, the holocaust is still ingrained into the collective memory, and until people stop reiterating its significance (to a point) within Israel, there shall always be a problem, as any action taken against Israel (and its populace) will be regarded as anti-Semitic.

Personally, I almost never watch live TV - I pay the licence fee so I get the odd Sports Pass on NowTV without breaking the law.  If the link were broken, I'd stop paying it.

[Kernow held out longer than any other non-Welsh British kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornwall#Conflict_with_Wessex) (apart from Strathclyde I think), and from what I've read was never fully incorporated into what was to become England by the Anglo-Saxons.

I've been to Cornwall, and it is a shame that the modern image of the place is miners and pasties and lifeboats and Doc Martin. There's such a rich culture and history there (a history that has been legitimately repressed) that deserves to be known

That said, the government in London probably couldn't recognise the Cornish as a racial group due to the absolute quagmire that is the modern British genetic makeup (and I don't think anyone really wants to go down that road in 2015 anyway), but as a cultural group, certainly, and it seems like all regional parliaments should have more say than they currently do.

&gt;Dear Sir or Madam,

&gt;In the recent Government response to the petition ""Make the production, sale and use of cannabis legal.""* it was stated that ""Despite the potential opportunity offered by legalisation to raise revenue through taxation, there would be costs in relation to administrative, compliance and law enforcement activities, as well as the wider costs of drug prevention and health services.""

&gt;Unfortunately the statement does not give any sources for this assertion, so I wondered if indeed the potential tax revenue available from the legalised sale of cannabis in the UK had been studied by HMRC.

The team I am thinking about would look something like the following, with Krammy as the centre forward. We could also play two midfielders then, both capable of covering the defence and making intelligent plays. It will be slightly less lethal going forward, but is a little more balanced.

Anti-competitive behavior in about the market not about how many viewers you get on a night. Allowing the BBC to openly compete for viewers is allowing them to use their guaranteed funding stream as an unfair advantage, they don't have to worry about topping the ratings. Taking measures purely for the goal of damaging your competitors with nothing to gain is very anti-competitive.

&gt;But does it affect ad revenue? Not in the slightest.

And your evidence for it is an event which happens every 4 years which the BBC also shows? How does that prove there is no effect? I don't quite follow that logic.

In the past (I don't know how good they are now) doing that exact same thing with TalkTalk has led to 45 minutes of rebooting the computer and checking the TCP/IP settings in Windows, before following the script gets us back to the call handler asking me log into the router's webpage, at 192.168.1.1, and telling me to do exactly what I tried to start the conversation with.

It's been a few years since I was doing that work, but over a period of 2 or 3 years I was phoning ISPs' technical support numbers pretty regularly - every few weeks - because of line problems, and there are certainly some ISPs which are better than others.

There are also some ISPs which can be terribly slow at peak times, although that's probably less of a problem these days.

I gave up replying to these kinds of threads, though, because my experience of multiple different ISPs on a regular basis, is given no more value than other random anecdotes of ""me and my flatmates have been on This Co. for a year now, and they're loads better than the ISP we had before"".

My intention would be to make public transport safer for everyone from the train platform, to the bus stop to on the mode of transport itself. However, I would consult with women and open it up to hear their views on whether women-only carriages would be welcome - and also if piloting this at times and modes of transport where harassment is reported most frequently would be of interest.

... would be against the BBC charter &amp; Agreement.

The sponsors in the stadium are sponsoring the *event*. They have no interaction with the broadcast rights holders whatsoever. Broadcasters don't get any revenue from that. In the case of the world cup, it all goes to FIFA. ITV gets the money from commercials shown during the breaks.

I used that example as it is the only time where the BBC and ITV show the same footage - where they are in a 1:1 content competition. And yet even that extreme example doesn't affect ITV's revenue. Because to ITV's sales department, the BBC doesn't exist. To the ad buyers, the BBC doesn't exist. If the BBC schedules Strictly against BGT and Strictly somehow gets 80% of the UK audience, that wouldn't affect ITV. Because it's the 20% who aren't watching the BBC that ad buyers are taking into consideration.

ITV's revenue depends on the percentage of the *commercial* audience it attracts, not the total TV audience. And ITV is the biggest venue for commercial audiences. The price doesn't change if 4m viewers watch it or 8m viewers watch it, as long as that represents the same percentage of the audience who are *not* watching the BBC. The cost of a 30-second commercial during *Coronation Street* is around ¬£300,000.

You know someone who enjoys a smoke once in a while or a drink at the pub or a party, right? That counts as drug use.


The facts are, and these **are** facts - the War on Drugs, in its 50 years have left behind misery and destruction, negatively affecting communities and destroying livelihoods and possibility of education and employment for those who have been incarcerated for non violent drug crimes. This is the War on Drugs in action in America. In early 1900s America there was a period of prohibition on Alcohol where criminals and corrupt cops profited off of this opportunity. The general population turned criminal because they wanted a drink. Speakeasies opened up, organised crime took off, and bootleg circulated the places where you can get alcohol.


In Portugal drugs are decriminalised. This does not mean you can go into a supermarket and grab a handful of kush on your way to the checkout. This doesn't mean that the Portuguese suddenly became a bunch of crack heads and stoners. What this means is that the government has taken the ""money game"" part out of drugs. From organised crime to your average dealers, people no longer profit off of the illegal drug trade. The government receives the money legally. Drugs are not cut with fuck knows what. Cases of police brutality, profiling, and incarceration for non violent drug crimes are down. Previously drug dependent people can go and seek help without fear of being prosecuted for their drug use.

If we get in a CB to replace Virgil; a good, tall striker, and probably a LB to at least compete with Izzy, we'll be in decent shape. The midfield is pretty stacked so I think we're okay there. 

As for tonight - best learnt from and moved on. Janko was the right choice given the choices he had, Berget skinned him a few times but I thought, for his age and experience level, he did okay. He reminds me of last year when Denayer arrived - talented but very raw. A few good games and he could shape up very well. Mulgrew on the other hand was completely the wrong call - Charlie isn't a left back any more, he hasn't regularly played there in years and by all accounts doesn't want to. I know there's been some grumbling about Izzy recently but there's no doubt in my mind he would have been the better choice tonight. Both Ronny and his team have quite a bit to learn.

We need to get into the CL groups next year though. Failure is not an option; if we don't, I feel like it'll be a long time before we do again. The vicious cycle of having less money and worse games, so not being able to get good players, only gets worse from here.

- The main parties convinced precisely 495,536 people *not* to vote UKIP between the Euro elections and the general.

- UKIP lost significant vote share in four target seats based on its 2010 and 2014 performances: South Basildon and East Thurrock -4.43%, Croydon Central -24.45%, Rochester &amp; Strood -11.6%, Clacton -15.3%

- UKIP was beaten into third by Labour in *half* of its top 12 target seats.

Some women have raised with me that a solution to the rise in assault and harassment on public transport could be to introduce women only carriages. My intention would be to make public transport safer for everyone from the train platform, to the bus stop to on the mode of transport itself. However, I would consult with women and open it up to hear their views on whether women-only carriages would be welcome - and also if piloting this at times and modes of transport where harassment is reported most frequently would be of interest.

So you're claiming viewership has nothing to do with the pricing of ad space? That's an incredible claim, do you have a source for that? Leaving that aside your argument still doesn't work, the BBC's figures do affect ITV. Lets say one week Britain Apparently Lacks Talent attracts half of the audience one week, the Beeb get nothing and everyone else gets half (50,0,50). Now the next strictly is on an halves the BGT viewership (25,25,50). In the first week ITV had half the commercial viewers, the second they had just a third. Now in the real world those viewers wouldn't come solely from BGT but the people who watched BGT in the first week would be far more likely to watch Strictly than everyone else, so the share of the commercial viewers would fall. Everything is fine when the programs aren't similar genres, when they start competing like for like it will hurt ITV.

Secondly it's a phone-in show, it's not just advertising. If people aren't watching it live they aren't spending money.
