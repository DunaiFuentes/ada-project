If Jeremy Corbyn becomes leader of the UK Labour Party, one positive consequence will be the ensuing discussion of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.

It all started with his presentation on “The Economy in 2020” given on July 22:

The ‘rebalancing’ I have talked about here today means rebalancing away from finance towards the high-growth, sustainable sectors of the future. How do we do this? One option would be for the Bank of England to be given a new mandate to upgrade our economy to invest in new large scale housing, energy, transport and digital projects: Quantitative easing for people instead of banks. Richard Murphy has been one of many economists making that case.

That passage seems to have been mostly ignored until August 3, when Chris Leslie, Labour’s shadow chancellor, attacked the policy, which in turn led to a detailed response from the aforementioned Richard Murphy (see also here and here), at which point what seems like the bulk of the British economics commentariat erupted. Just search the internet for “Corbynomics” if you don’t believe us.

Much of the commentary has been negative — former Bank of England economist Tony Yates concluded, for example, that “People’s QE” would be “the first step along the road to undermining the social usefulness of money” — although Chris Dillow gave an intelligent defense.

We don’t understand the negativity. Some of the specific arguments justifying the proposal may be flawed, but the core idea is sound and possesses an impressive intellectual pedigree. In fact, it could help solve one of the most troublesome questions in central banking: how policymakers can accomplish their objectives using the tools at their disposal, without producing too many unpleasant side effects.

One of the oddities of “monetary policy” is that it has almost no direct impact on how much money there is to go around.

Virtually all of what we commonly think of and use as money is actually short-term debt issued and retired at will by private financial firms. Monetary policymakers can affect the incentives of these profit-seeking entities but they have little control over the amount of nominal spending occurring in the economy. Nudging the unsecured overnight interbank lending rate up and down can encourage lenders to adjust their leverage, but good luck tying that to the traditional price stability mandate. (Also, a friendly reminder that the level of interest rates is basically irrelevant for corporate investment.)

Then there’s QE. Central banks across the rich world have been “printing money” — trillions! — without producing a large and obvious impact on inflation or real growth. That’s because, contrary to popular belief and the misleading language of too many commentators, they haven’t been “printing” anything at all. What’s actually happened is that policymakers have been finding people with extremely liquid assets and buying those assets at market prices. Giving someone $100 in exchange for an easy-to-sell bond currently trading at $100 has some impact but it’s much less exciting than “printing money”. As Mark Dow put it, “if we all understood monetary policy better, the Fed’s policies would be working far less well.”

The existing monetary policy tools also have the unseemly property of appearing to work mainly by making the rich richer and hoping that some of the extra wealth gets spent. Even if it’s true that the rest of society benefits from this, because otherwise they’d be unemployed, this is trickle-down monetary policy. The Bank of England admitted that “in practice, the benefits from these wealth effects will accrue to those households holding most financial assets”.

Cutting out the middle men is the most obvious way to improve the transmission of central banker desires into economic reality. If policymakers want people to spend, they shouldn’t try to juice share and home prices, or fiddle about with borrowing costs at the margin, but actually give people money.

(This, by the way, was the core insight of the “Capitol Hill Baby Sitting Co-op Crisis” made famous by Professor Krugman. There was no “monetary policy” as conventionally understood, just fiscal policy paired with monetisation of deficits. We highly recommend reading the original article in full, but the short version is that budget surpluses caused by excessive taxation led to a shrinking money supply and an unwillingness of the co-op’s members to use their increasingly-valuable scrip to purchase time away from the kids. Fiscal stimulus — a one-time tax rebate plus permanent tax cuts — solved the initial problem, but wasn’t executed well, so the co-op soon started suffering from a surfeit of scrip and too many people wanting to go out on the town.)

Our preferred approach would be direct deposits into household accounts offered at the central bank. It’s simple and doesn’t require any political debate about how best to spend the newly created money.

But Corbyn’s plan to have the Bank of England fund government-directed investment in infrastructure could also work, especially if the pace of investment were adjusted according to the condition of the economy. In fact, Adam Posen supported something similar when he was on the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, except that he focused on small businesses.

Compare what Posen said back in 2011:

&gt;I would suggest that the Government set up two new public institutions to address the investment gap by increasing the availability of credit to SMEs and to new firms. One would be a public bank or authority for lending to small business…The other institution I would encourage the Government to set up would be an entity to bundle and securitize loans made to SMEs. Essentially, we need a good version of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to create a more liquid and deep market for illiquid securities which can then be sold off of bank(s) balance sheets…

&gt;And this is where the Bank of England comes in. Both of these entities, the new SME lender(s) and Bennie, would need an initial infusion of capital…By announcing a commitment to lending the initial (gilt-backed) capital for these proposed entities, assuring all that such entities if well managed can have liquidity from the central bank as needed, and publicly supporting their creation, the Bank can do a lot to fill financing and investment gap in the UK…

&gt;More explicit and active cooperation between monetary policy and governmental programs to rectify our resulting investment shortfall is not only good policy, but likely to enhance the credibility and viability of our monetary regime. Our current credit allocation problems and resulting investment shortfall is one of the biggest specific barriers to recovery and to sustainable price stability in Britain. Monetary policy in the form of more QE will address this shortfall. The Bank of England, however, can and should go further than just doing more QE to remove this barrier to investment and growth in new and smaller businesses.

…to Richard Murphy’s description of “People’s Quantitative Easing”:

&gt;People’s quantitative easing is…a highly directed process where the debt that is repurchased has been deliberately created and issued either by a green investment bank or by local authorities, health trusts and other such agencies for the specific purpose of funding new investment in the economy at the time when big business and financial markets are completely failing to deliver the scale of investment that is needed to get the UK working again and to restore our financial prosperity.

And again:

&gt;No one is saying that this puts the BoE in charge of investment policy. It is just the purchaser of debts, as is the ECB right now to the tune of €60 billion a month. The decisions on how the money is used will rest solely with the government. The BoE is simply acting as a bank, providing funding for that purpose in a way that Mark Carney and Mario Draghi have both said is technically and legally possible.

Posen thought that private lenders weren’t providing credit where he believed it was needed, so he recommended creating new public investment banks that could originate and securitise loans into bonds that could then be purchased by the Bank of England, thereby funding new business investment. Corbyn/Murphy want specialised “green” investment banks, housing authorities, and local governments to be able to finance infrastructure investment secure in the knowledge that the Bank of England will be there to provide funding support. We fail to see a significant difference.

You could oppose the policy because you think the government will make bad investments, but by that logic you’re really just against any government-led infrastructure spending. You could also object to the idea that the government is effectively using the central bank to finance its deficit spending and undermining the shibboleth of “central bank independence”, but you would have to contend with the arguments of, among others, Martin Wolf, Paul McCulley, and that old communist Milton Friedman.

The main concern about Corbynomics isn’t whether the monetary transmission mechanism needs an upgrade — it does — but whether the UK actually needs that much additional investment spending.

There’s a plausible case to be made that the existing budget and household debt forecasts imply an unsustainable household debt spiral, so any additional spending that doesn’t require the private sector to live far beyond its means should be welcome.

If you worked for an employer who didn't offer a salary sacrifice scheme, you would pay out of your net salary and reclaim tax paid from HMRC directly.

To get back to the main point, most union fees are not allowable expenses, people who think they are paying them via salary sacrifice are wrong, they'll be paying by a deduction from their net pay.

Suppose you reject this analysis and prefer traditional guides to macro policy. A quick look at employment and hours worked suggests the economy is on fire and could use some rate hikes. But if you separate out the extra work effort from what’s happened with real incomes, the implication is that UK productivity growth has been [abysmal](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/files/2015/08/UK-GDP-decomposition1.png).



If Corbyn’s preferred investments are useful, they could help restore some of the lost ground in productivity and lead to higher real wages for Britons. And by expanding capacity, this extra investment spending may not even end up being inflationary. (The actual amounts in question, according to Murphy, are quite small relative to the size of the UK economy.)

“People’s QE” is far from an obviously wrong idea. Implemented properly, it could even improve the Bank of England’s ability to fulfill its mandate without needing to goose house prices or get into contentious debates about helping the rich at the expense of pensioners.

What else is it? If someone writes an article attacking only one single target then that's the literal definition of a ""hit piece"". Someone sat down, researched a bunch of figures, threw away what didn't stick and wrote it up with the sole intention of making one party look bad.

Anything that it can't get around mentioning or dirtying is indicated as something they ""inherited"" from Labour. The writers allegiance is pretty blatant, he/she might as well sign it ""bitter labour supporter"". 

&gt; Indeed your assertion that criticism of the snp and the yes campaign was a detour to attacking scots proves the pint that criticism of those movements is taken personally by its supporters.

It's not an assertion or perception issue. Did you not see the press leading up to the most recent general election? It was completely vitriolic, even some of the folks from that camp were taken aback by just how bad it was, particularly the sexism that followed Sturgeon taking over over. 

The English ""gentry"" look down on the Scots. It's just the way it is. Maybe this feeling isn't common across most of England but there absolutely was an anti-Scottish vibe to the UK around the time of the indyref and somewhat so during the recent election. ""Spurned"" is the best word to describe it, people were just angry that we would even consider to leave the UK.

&gt; The independence campaign was [not] watertight there were questions as to its financial projections and the fact the mere raising of these issues was seen negative really said it all

There was some of that but there also was an overriding feeling of ""Scots are too dumb/weak/wee to rule themselves"" followed by a gleeful ""fine then, let them have it and we'll rofl at their failure"". And that is undeniably negative.

&gt; I'm seeing the same thing with the Corbyn campaign. Any criticism is part of a propaganda campaign

This is based on personal experience obviously, but I find that it's mostly English people who identify primarily as British whilst the Welsh and Scots will 99% of the time identify as Welsh or Scottish respectively and *maybe* British as a second national identity but this seems to be rare.

Whilst it's true that Rangers  and Celtic kind of want to play in England, it's only since money completely took over football and leagues like the Dutch and Scottish ones became overshadowed by the wealthier European ones. It's not a cultural thing either way, it's purely financial. Same reason the Welsh teams in England don't want to play in the Welsh league.

Look on gumtree, spareroom and the local property press. Most rooms that are going to be in your price range are not going to be on the big sites like zoopla and rightmove.

Google tells me Walsall operate a bond guarantee scheme for people threatened with homelessness, which it sounds like benefit from: http://cms.walsall.gov.uk/de/index/bond_scheme_for_private_landlords_.htm

All of it is gone unless you're at ministerial level. We are just the same as you and get fucked over on all sides. We get nothing from above and the printed media is out to vilify us at every turn.

null,null,NotEtreo,,Yvette | Ben | Sadiq,null,"&gt;It is not only underpinned by those three historical precedents, as should be obvious from the ridiculously narrow parameters he sets up: Electoral history did not start in 1983 and is not confined to the UK. Historically, all of Labour's general election-winning leaders (MacDonald, Attlee, Wilson and Blair) were from the right of the party. Yes, even everyone's hero, Attlee. Additionally, although I don't know global politics so well, I do know that in other countries, we see a similar pattern of elections being won from the centre ground. Again, this should be fairly obvious: It's common knowledge that Blair lifted much of his strategy directly from Bill Clinton's successful 1992 campaign.

&gt;So, the whole contention of his article is fundamentally flawed, because he has failed to properly understand the nature and scope of the historical precedent involved in the 'winning from the centre-ground' theory. Incidentally, there are also flaws within each of his descriptions of the 'historical precedents', but since the whole premise is flawed, it doesn't seem like a good use of my time to go through and disprove them all individually.

&gt;However, he doesn't stop being wrong there! The argument that Corbyn is unlikely to win an election is not only underpinned by historical precedents. There have been numerous opinion polls and studies conducted since the election (and one from a few years previously), which, taken together provide really quite compelling evidence that Corbyn can't win for Labour:

- The [TUC's 2015 election post-mortem poll](http://touchstoneblog.org.uk/2015/05/the-tucs-election-post-mortem-poll/) , which found we were too soft on welfare and immigration, and not trusted on the economy (i.e., would tax and spend too much).

- [Listening to Labour's Lost Labour Voters](http://www.scribd.com/doc/271940748/Listening-to-Labour-s-Lost-Labour-Voters-bbm-Research-July-2015), by BBM Research, which confirms the findings of the TUC's poll.

- [Red Alert: Why Labour Lost and What Needs to Change?](https://smithinstitutethinktank.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/red-alert-why-labour-lost-and-what-needs-to-change.pdf), by the Smith Institute, which provides yet more evidence that Labour lost because it was untrusted on immigration and the economy.

- A [survey for YouGov/The Times](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/jvcr8gkvrb/SundayTimesResults_150724_W.pdf), that shows, yet again, that Labour weren't trusted on the economy.

- [The Mountain to Climb](http://www.fabians.org.uk/the-mountain-to-climb/), by the Fabian Society, which finds that our clearest path to victory is to win votes from Conservative voters.

- [Peter Kellner's research for Prospect/YouGov](http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/labour-voters-election-europe-immigration), which shows that the votes Labour lost from 1997-2012 (the year the study was conducted) were lost primarily to its right not, as conventional wisdom assumes, to its left.

&gt;In other words, this article is essentially one long strawman, in that it assumes that there is a general 'don't turn into your comfort zone' argument

&gt;There are three historical precedents that underpin that argument

&gt;People believe Corbyn can't win because of both of the above
In fact, as I have shown, there is not only a general historical precedent that is much wider than he assumes (in that it goes back further and applies to countries other than the UK), but there is also a much deeper specific argument that in order to win the next election we need to do several things that are anathema to Corbyn and his followers.",null,0,null,1438890148,null,null,false,0,ctty53b,null,t3_3g0kn6,null,null,null,t1_cttxg5i,null,null,null,1440323502,null,4,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,4,null

No but you were indirect beneficiaries of it, and as you know hedge funds and investment banks have many shared interests and features, so you're not wriggling out of this quite so easily. The fate of one and the fate of the other are inextricably linked.

Hahahah hahah fucking brilliant that's even better than that other spiv I was arguing with holy fuck

Let me put to you very bluntly. I think the *entire financial services industry* is a fucking racket, a base of criminality, and should be systematically broken up, with what remains reclassifed as a public utility and brought into public ownership. No compensation.  

I think the leading hedge fund managers globally should be publicly executed, although I'd be willing to settle for long custodial sentences and depriving them of all their loot.

And for all the fire and brimstone hyperbole (which is of course for my own amusement if nothing else) I have to be candid, I'm totally sincere about all that. 

&gt;Was there mismanagement and malpractice that contributed to the severity of the 2008-09 crisis? Yes, absolutely.

Wasn't ""mis-management"" - this is the usually mealy-mouthed *bad apples* shit that people like you use to excuse the criminal behaviour of your chosen profession/industry. It was systemic. This wasn't an anomaly, crisis and recesssion are a structural feature of every capitalist economy since day 1. 

&gt;Has that malpractice been punished in the form of record-breaking fines levied by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic? Oh look, that's a yes too.

ahahaha brilliant stuff *leave those good-hearted financiers alone! They've served their time, they've suffered enough!!!* 

I'm not satisfied with fining them some tiny fraction of their wealth I want the entire industry to be destroyed. I want you unemployed and picking through the bins for your food. I want to see a government elected that will reduce you, your family and your colleagues to the place of fear and desperation that I've seen in people where I live. I want to see someone do to you what maggie did the miners, with interest (for the obvious historical irony alone)

Yakin - Coached only in Switzerland and 1 year for CSKA Mosow. Won the Swiss league... Sorry why is he more qualified?

Simeone - Fantastic! Not going anywhere anytime soon, so I'm not sure why you even listed him.

Bielsa - Performed well for... one season with Bilbao. Apparnetly has problems keeping his star players around. Won nothing...

Fournier - Guided Reims back to Ligue 1... not much else.

Many of have family there and/or have spent significant parts of our lives there, and for us, supporting Spurs is, like you say, part of maintaining those connections. 

Put another way, it's absolutely true that European football generally, and Spurs particularly are becoming more and more commodities. At a practical level, this means that the traditions and experiences of local fans are given second priority next to the marketing of the product for a global, television-watching, kit-buying audience. It's a mistake, however, to think that the global consumers do not have or want connections to the source, or do not value the experiences and traditions of local fans. And, this is why the Fighting Cock and other fan-driven organizations are so important. Without them, fans in distant lands would have significantly less connection to Spurs as a local organism, to the traditions of White Hart Lane, to the history of the club, and to the wishes of the local supporters. I don't know any non-London-based supporter who is not sympathetic to the trouble of matches in Newcastle or Burnley on a Monday night, or what a distasteful thing it will be to have to take the train up to Milton Keynes every weekend, or what a loss it will be to have a new White Hart Lane--as long as those foreign fans have a connection to local fans through groups like the Fighting Cock, Echoes of Glory, and so on. 

It's true that the commodification of the game can strip it of its local meanings as it is repackaged and marketed around the world--but it's also true that supporters around the world value those local meanings as well.

Hi guys!

So I recently bought some new parts to replace some that I sold (I regretting selling them in the end!) but now I've decided I want to upgrade to the new generation of Intel chips (when they come out :P) and a better GPU to power my gaming as I feel sometimes a bit lack luster with my 970.

I'm looking to sell the following items,

* Palit Jetstream 970 - £200
* Intel i5-4690k - £125
* Asus Z97-P - £45

Please note the CPU is still in the system as I don't want to remove it until it's sold as that could be several days :p that's why I included the speccy.

Our problem right now is that the top four is cemented in almost every single season. The same teams keep finishing in the top four with few exceptions, and the prize money and quality of players that comes with qualification are further cementing their place in the top four. 

For us to break into that we need things to be shaken up. 

Hypothetical situation for you: Imagine eliminating the fourth spot a few years ago. Suddenly Arsenal don't look like the guaranteed Champions League qualifiers they once were. They have trouble, like us, in signing world class talent. They also have less money to sign new players. We are suddenly on an equal footing with them. We start finishing in 4th place more often. Then one year the 4th CL spot comes back and we could be the team to snatch it up. 

Now imagine eliminating two of the spots a few years ago. Now we've qualified for the champions league just as often as United and Arsenal in the past five years. Suddenly a guy like Sanchez doesn't favour Arsenal over us automatically.  Guaranteed champions league qualification is almost non-existent with only two spots, except maybe for Chelsea. This benefits us greatly for our league chances.

null,null,ThePoeticMotion,null,null,null,"I'm aware that Rodgers has final say, but it is clear that he favours certain players and others on the committee favour certain players, so ultimately there will be discrepancies. It isn't as cut and dry as saying well Rodgers approves all the signings therefore they are all technically his signings because if all his favoured options are overlooked by the committee then he might be left with no option. In this example, it was reported that Rodgers favoured Ashley Williams, and perhaps others, over Sakho but was vetoed on this and had to settle for Sakho. Balotelli was a similar situation. This is not speculation but instead the utterings of respected journalists like Barrett and Pearce. I think the issue is that you are taking the phrase committee signing too literally. Nobody is suggesting that Rodgers had *no* say in the signings, but that he didn't get his top targets and therefore it was a more committee influenced signing. Sakho has never been backed by the manager as evidenced by his lack of playtime and the signing of a central defender who plays the same side and who has been used ahead of Sakho when both are fit (up until Lovren's position became untenable). I have not once suggested that a manager not playing Sakho is a perfect indication of the fact he wasn't his own signing but instead that it is an indication of that fact, especially when you consider the other evidence of this. You are completely misrepresenting my argument. There is a difference between using something as evidence of a fact and suggesting  that this evidence implies that the premise *must* be true. When we acknowledge all the information available to us *including* the fact Sakho hasn't been favoured by Rodgers it evidences the notion. You do understand the difference, don't you? It doesn't mean I think that a player out of favour is *necessarily* not a Rodgers signing. That would be a stupid argument. But it's one that I haven't once made yet you keep dressing my argument as if I have.

No, it's a correction about you talking about ""your bailout"".


&gt;No but you were indirect beneficiaries of it, and as you know hedge funds and investment banks have many shared interests and features, so you're not wriggling out of this quite so easily. The fate of one and the fate of the other are inextricably linked. 

Indirectly, possibly. That's probably the only rational thing you've mentioned here.

&gt;Hahahah hahah fucking brilliant that's even better than that other spiv I was arguing with holy fuck

That's cool, just don't quote the second half of *that same paragraph* where I go on to say that ""yes, I'm making a ridiculous and tenuous link""... I fully acknowledge that it's a ridiculous argument to make, but if we're on the subject of ridiculous arguments:


&gt;Let me put to you very bluntly. I think the entire financial services industry is a fucking racket, a base of criminality, and should be systematically broken up, with what remains reclassifed as a public utility and brought into public ownership. No compensation.

Wow. Just what justification, exactly, do you have for an accusation such as that? 


&gt;I think the leading hedge fund managers globally should be publicly executed, although I'd be willing to settle for long custodial sentences and depriving them of all their loot.

Public executions for people who happen to be more successful at what they do than you will ever be? And for what crimes, exactly? 


&gt;Wasn't ""mis-management"" - this is the usually mealy-mouthed bad apples shit that people like you use to excuse the criminal behaviour of your chosen profession/industry. It was systemic. This wasn't an anomaly, crisis and recesssion are a structural feature of every capitalist economy since day 1. 


My profession is not inherently criminal, and I have no time for people who choose to make baseless accusations and generalisations with no grounds in fact or anything approaching reality.


&gt;I'm not satisfied with fining them some tiny fraction of their wealth I want the entire industry to be destroyed. I want you unemployed and picking through the bins for your food. I want to see a government elected that will reduce you, your family and your colleagues to the place of fear and desperation that I've seen in people where I live. I want to see someone do to you what maggie did the miners, with interest (for the obvious historical irony alone)

Guess what though, I'm satisfied. I'm very satisfied knowing that your wants will never come to fruition. The skills I have now mean that I can turn my hand to a number of different industries should I so choose (unless technology is also now the base of evil because *government interception*. It's a shame that people of your caliber seem to be very intent on dragging everyone else above them down, rather than wondering how they might elevate others up. 

But hey, like I said - no-one has yet been able to debate with me without resorting to cliches or personal attacks, of which you have just demonstrated both in abundance. It's quite clear that no amount of rational conversation will ever change your warped and absurd view of the world, namely because combating drivel like this with reasoned arguments is pointless. I've given it my best shot though, simply because to leave the absurdity above this without some response doesn't sit right.

Those arguments are all fine and good *if* you're happy to break the law and *potentially* be jailed for it. Keep in mind the topic of discussion - They're trying everything to make piracy as hard as possible, to make it as intimidating as possible. This goes double with the government largely being in the pockets of the industry, and the government also having a massive programme of bulk collection and monitoring of internet activity.

For people who actually buy things legally, the picture is increasingly bleak.

&gt; It's a losing game and it results in things like Netflix and Spotify to keep hold of a customer base that basically chooses to pay you because they feel generous or particularly ethical that day.

And what's the important thing about Netflix and Spotify? That you pay for them. Monthly. Forever. Yes, it's £5.99 a month, but that's for *life*. If you're subbed to [subscription service here] from the second you hit 18 until you die on your 81st birthday (average 2012 uk life expectancy), that's £4528.44. Probably a fair bit more than most people spend on their DVD/video collections in a lifetime. And that's just for one sub. Now add the music sub. Now add potentially more subs because companies refuse to release content to the provider you're already subbed with. Then you probably have to digitally buy copies of things you really like anyway because the library provided by a streaming service is neither infinite, nor permanent.

And when a person dies *noone can benefit from buying their stuff on the cheap from a charity store*. Their sub lapses, their money is gone, there's nothing to show for it. This kills the second hand market. This is *brilliant* for the producing industry - You can keep charging full price for your old rope because 'used' product will cease to exist.

A proper, competitive ball has not been kicked (whatever you want to call these games, they are still pre-season in everyone's eyes), and you're already trying to write Bilic off. When did we all become Spurs fans, crowing about how we're gonna get in the Champion's League every year? Whinge, whinge, whinge, is all some of you lot do. Being a West Ham fan is rolling with the punches. Sure, some of us would have liked to stay in the Europa League. We didn't, that's unfortunate, but I see #BilicOut hashtags and I wonder if you've all lost your fucking minds. 

1. We didn't deserve to be in the Europa League anyway. We're not ready (clearly) and it's a hiding to nothing what with injuries and a bloated schedule. Bilic made a difficult decision to risk a cup competition we are not prepared for in order to save his aces for the Premier League, you know, the competition that actually decides the fate of our club.
2. The Europa League is a fucking joke anyway. Nobody gives a toss about it, and as we have seen, it's full of strange little clubs that spend more time surrounding the referee and rolling around on the floor than they do playing football. Granted, Astra were a decent side, but they still managed to fuck me off with the amount of play-acting they did.
3. Everyone moaned about Allardyce not playing youth. Bilic plays youth and people want to slate him for it. Okay, 11 changes might have been a bit drastic, but this is a world away from the lambs that Allardyce sent out to slaughter at Notts Forest. These lads looked good: bright and lively and fit - if a bit naive. They didn't disgrace themselves at all, they just lost. It happens. Can any of you honestly sit there and tell me that we would have got even this far under BFS?

Football is a marathon, not a sprint, and I will happily trade a limping campaign in the Europa League for a better position in the Premier League (not the European places, as I said, we're not ready financially or in depth of talent).

Let's see what happens on Sunday and then maybe we will know a bit more about our manager and the squad he has assembled. Even then I can see some of you lunatics shouting for Bilic's head if we lose.

Get a grip.

null,null,ADozenNeverNudes,null,null,null,"What is your *legal basis* for saying you are 99% sure a judge would agree with you? Because the legal basis is what matters, not what you feel is right. I have never, ever had a case I was 99% sure on. So let us look at this properly...

You have a contract that states it automatically renews. That is a problem, no two ways about it - this would likely lead to the presumption that the contract had continued, so that puts you on the back foot. 

You need to show that the wording of the contract is not what you agreed to, and a mistake has been made. If you have any evidence of the conversation you had with the salesman that would be enormously valuable. This would be explicit evidence of what was in fact agreed to. However, in the absence of this you would need to rely on the fact that the standing order section has been crossed out is implicit evidence that the agreement wasn't supposed to renew. This is plausible, but other explanations are plausible too - like you would want to receive an invoice and choose where to pay the money from. Which explanation is the most plausible? It isn't clear, which is why this isn't a '99%' case by a long way.  

Essentially there are a few options:

a) Ignore them and hope this is bluff, it may well be. Sometimes this is a valid strategy. At most reiterate that you agreed the contract would not renew and they are mistaken. Don't set out long arguments as it gives them something to come back against - justnstate as a simple fact that the contract was agreed to be fixed.

b) Try to compromise, maybe agree an extra 6 months. They could take this as better than nothing.

c) Lawyer up - would be threatening but expensive. ",null,0,null,1438895082,null,null,false,0,ctu1m1g,null,t3_3g0eeh,null,null,null,t3_3g0eeh,null,null,null,1440325139,null,1,null,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,1,null

Also visit Strangford Lough and the Mourne Mountains. Lough Erne is always nice too, but a bit of a drive. While you're there, may as well visit the Marble Arch Caves. 

You can do a trashy terror tour in one of the black taxis, or the open top buses that run, but usually people always look very depressed on those things.

If you wanted to you could do it with much less than that, £5k should easily be enough for removal costs and sols fees and fees on a mtg application. You could even do it cheaper for example if you had family and friends to help move furniture and I am assuming you are a first time buyer (FTB) so won't have a lot to move.

He also mentions that the best rates are at 75%, whilst they may be better rates they are not the only rates. Most lenders will go to 90% - some even 95%! Although yes you will have to pay a higher interest on the mortgage it is still better than burning your money in rent and given the relatively low value or the property a higher interest rate won't make a massive difference on the monthly payment.

Most lenders for FTB need to see continuous employment history of 12 months so that bit you shouldn't need to worry about if you aren't planning on buying for another few years. Also in another few years if you are on a salary of £20k you should be able to save up quite a bit more (although you have a good start with the £11k already :).

Have you looked into the Help to Buy scheme as well? There is some useful information on there http://www.helptobuy.org.uk/

null,null,kopking08,null,null,null,"The Klopp adoration is a pretty well worn myth at this point. Plop that guy into Liverpool of the last five to seven years and I can guarantee we'd have done no better or worse with him. This idea that he's a miracle worker has always been tied to his performance as manager in what was a subpar league (it has rebounded) and at a time when Bayern was out of sorts. The minute the Bayern ship got righted, Dortmund hasn't even been within striking distance of a challenge - despite finishing second. I'll agree his performances in the CL were great, but if managers for England's best clubs knew they could mail it in with the league and still get CL, the push for the CL would be a lot easier.

I'm also baffled by the Ancelotti love. But then again, winning trophies has never, for me, been the clearest indication of any manager's talent. To bring in an American example:

Many people consider Phil Jackson to be one of the best ever coaches. He won all these titles with the Bulls. Then he quit and waited years before returning to the league because he only wanted to join a team ready to win championships. So he goes to the Lakers, with the best team in the league, and low and behold he wins Championships. 

This is an apt comparison for European football managers who are considered greats, who float around between the best clubs in every league, never once facing a challenge. They're often former players themselves who got into organizations young and were able to get to the highest rungs far quicker than someone who had no great connections. People consider them greats but what challenges have they ever faced? I give a great deal more credit, as much as I hate to say it, to the Fergusons, Wengers, and Rodgers who had to build their careers from the bottom to get to the perch they find themselves at.

Ancelloti has bounced around from top club to top club and he is dismissed the moment each club faces the slightest setback, but with his reputation perpetually in tact. 

It's a results driven league, but people need to sometimes look at the trajectory of a club. If I thought we were stagnating or going backwards under Rodgers I would gladly see him go. But I see us genuinely building something here. Something that could pay massive dividends as soon as this season. We got so close before.

null,null,Marshton,null,null,null,"Financial advisor is probably a good bet - from what it sounds like, there's been no discussion of investments or anything like that. Savings accounts are not the thing you should be looking at. One could do this sort of thing yourself, but it's a fair amount of effort.

I do think your biggest concern is that if the entire family is not well versed financially, a lot, if not all, of that money could very easily be sucked up by doing 'good deeds'. £10,000 for a new car for one grandkid isn't much, but if you've got 4 and they all want one, that's £40,000 gone. Then if mum and dad want something... a new holiday because they've been working so hard at work lately. It's very hard to say no in that case, especially if your grandmother is a kind hearted person. 

My advice in the short term is: don't promise any money to anyone. Don't tell anyone if you can help it. Don't make *any* commitments until you've seriously sat down, ideally with a financial advisor or a solicitor perhaps, and decided what your priorities are.

Edit: Should add - that sum of money will most likely affect the benefits your grandmother receives. One has to declare income from savings to the benefits people, so if your savings account pays 1%, she'd have to declare income of £2,200. Not much, but if interest rates rise in the next year or so that could be an issue. If invested properly, the interest you get on £220k alone could give your grandmother £18k to live on per year, pre-tax, if invested at 6-7% (easily done). That may be an option for her.

Edit2: Also, I'm young, so I see savings and investments as the logical way to go. But your grandmother may prefer tangible things - house renovation as you've said etc. - whatever she wants is fine!

null,null,wanson,lfc68,,null,"FWIW, my prediction is 3rd. I think we've improved in almost every area that we needed to. 

Chelsea, Man City, Man U and Arsenal's signing's haven't impressed me that much. Schweinsteiger is the exception but he's going to be injured most of the time.

Southampton have been picked apart again and Spurs haven't done anything. Spurs will be relying on Kane to reproduce his form of last season and if he can't they will struggle.

We've brought in a great right-back to replace a dodgy one. Gomez to challenge Moreno for left-back. Milner will add energy to our static midfield, with Can and Henderson. And Benteke will get goals on his own and even more when Sturridge is fit (which will be like a new signing in itself). Coutinho will be even better, as will Ibe, Lallana and Markovic. And finally, Firmino is going to be the balls. He's been one of the best attacking midfielders in Europe for the past two seasons, in one of the strongest leagues. I don't understand the doubts people have about him. Just look at his record, he's going to be phenomenal!

We have a tough start, but that suits us. We get to play the strongest teams in the league away from home before they have a chance to get some form. It gives us a better chance of getting points in those games and means we have a much easier run-in with all those teams having to come to Anfield in the second half of the season, when under Rodgers, we have generally been on fire.",null,0,null,1438895922,null,null,false,0,ctu26qn,null,t3_3fzg2z,null,null,null,t3_3fzg2z,null,null,null,1440325409,null,1,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

null,null,penurious,null,null,null,"&gt;I think economically many things could work. It's not hard to find an economist that will back up a range of policies. 

Which other policies are you thinking of?  There's not a lot more you can do with interest rates at the moment.  Corbyn is also talking about other means of fiscal policy (mainly progressive taxation) to fund reversal of the rolling back of the welfare state we've seen (this is of course a different argument).  To say ""well of course you can find an economist to back up any theory"" doesn't strike me as a substantive counter argument.

&gt;It also just doesn't make sense. People hate banks. Now suddenly they want a bank to have an even greater role simply because it is managed by the government who promises to do ""good""? An institution by no means guaranteed not to screw it all up given recent memory?

I disagree that there is an equivalence here.  The 'screw up' was done by private bankers all over the world who chased short-term profit at the expense of long-term economic stability.  A central investment bank comes with its own problems granted, but I don't see how they are comparable.

&gt;Regulators/experts didn't even understand the risks of what they were doing in the run up the crash, and still disagree as to some of the main causes! 

I disagree, I think a lot of the causes are well understood.  Also a lot of experts did realize the risks but were ignored.  A lot of bankers knew the problems too, but were too busy making money hand over fist.  A much more interesting question is why are we still experiencing relatively low growth, wages, productivity etc, seven years on.  Again just because we don't know everything what will happen due to a given policy doesn't mean we should do nothing.

&gt;We'd be trusting politicians (who you may not have voted for yourself!) to not use it in their interests, not throw money into projects to keep them going even if they are looking like they will fail (because it will make them look bad to pull the plug); I think aside from the theoretical economic pros/cons there are also significant social ones as well.

I'm guessing from your post that you're in general a 'small-state' free market kind of guy, which I respect in general.  However, I don't personally believe that having incomplete information about the economy and the effects of policy is an argument to do nothing.  If the banking crisis had a lesson, its that the free market can be just as blind as central governments.  

We've already seen that qe can be done without excessive inflationary effects.  The problem with qe last time was that banks tended to hoard the newly created liquid assets.  The point is that the project will give money directly to funding investment where it is needed.  Essentially money is forced into businesses/peoples hands, which will hopefully pick up aggregate demand.

In my opinion the economy is still on shaky ground and a policy like this will give a boost which out weighs the risk.  In all honestly though it will all depend where we are after the next election.  If the economy has truly recovered, then the policy may not be worthwhile, if the economy goes into recession again I really believe it would be foolish not to try.  If there is another recession I think even a Tory government would consider it!

The rumoured transfer offer from City was around £35m, which is ludicrous anyway, so imagine what we were willing to offer him in wages! I bet he would have been pushing the 250k/wk mark with bonuses included.

Honestly, I'm glad we didn't pursue Jack further than just interest and I hope our interest was just rumour. While he's a great player undoubtedly and a joy to watch, I think there is more negatives to paying a huge sum and wages to get him than if we didn't; the same applies for any club.

Arsenal only have to pay his wages which are justified when he plays as he's so talented.

Copyright covers specific expressions of an idea (say for example  ""Hey, I have a lot of sheep ha ha ha "" is copyrighted - the following phrase although similar in meaning is not infringing ' I've got a whole lot of sheeps...lol' ). 

All great and wonderful, but in the digital world its not so easy - youtube has a system called ContentId ( to help the copyright folks ) that tries to fingerprint content to allow 'owners*' identify infringing content - and that leads to abuse - as anything could be infringing if it met whatever criteria contentid goes by - I have no idea ( assume its some sort of name hashing, but it might be more complex than that) and so go the takedowns by automatic bot- whether its legit of not . It then becomes at case of presumed guilty. When faced by lawyers of  the behemoths of RIAA, MPAA et al most folk are going to just leave it 
(there are plenty of sites that record this sort of behaviour - popehat or techdirt cover more stuff but will probably point you into the better ones than I could) 

Its a very complicated mess and more laws only make it worse, especially as the owners* of the copyright are trying to squeeze every last drop of every ambiguous phrase in the law and force ever tightening of the rules. 

All the while the actual creators of the works (be it authors , song writers, performers etc ) generally ( ie most outside of those in the top x of their genre)  see less returns for the contract they sign. 

No wonder the boon in self publishing for smaller acts, they get their works out there but have to work harder on the business side . 

On the other side of the coin and for a decent look for how it works for a reasonably successful scifi author and how he thinks about this stuff try : http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/04/common-misconceptions-about-pu-1.html

Also his posting about fan fic is very sensible and pragmatic. 


* Owners of the copyright are often not the people that created it - they may have helped fund it or paid for it in a one time 'all you can eat deal' but more often (in the music industry at least) did not create the work.

null,null,convertedtoradians,null,null,null,"&gt; the judge has no authority to use 'common sense'

You're right, of course, legally, there's no question about that. You've correctly stated what the law says. But then *legally*, quite a few people became criminals today because of that ruling. So while I'm aware of what the law says about what the judge has to do, I don't see that it has to be the last word on the subject.

Everyone has the ability and the right and even the duty, I might say, to apply some level of common sense, and I don't absolve the judge of that. Like I said, we expect the policeman to ignore the law in certain circumstances; to *deliberately* ignore a clear violation of a the law. Every time we go on a motorway we can see people breaking the law by driving above the speed limit, but we expect the police to ignore it.

We expect local officials to be sensible too-- whether it's a teacher who won't let you take your kid out of school at the end of term for a couple of days or the jobsworth at the local tip who won't let you dump bags because of some technicality. When people stick to the letter of the rules, it can be pretty irritating and we don't hold back on criticising it.

In this case, I apply the same standard to the judge, I'm afraid. The law was clear, sure, but I expect him to use his common sense still. There wasn't a gun pointed at his head and I doubt he's on the poverty line, unable to speak out because if he does, he'll lose his minimum wage job; that's why I don't absolve him of his duty of being a reasonable human being before being anything else.

So what I'm suggesting is the hendo and milner behind coutinho who's behind the front three. I think this is the way to go because first of all Lallana/ibe bring more to the team than Lucas(I pick those two because Coutinho playing in mid isn't the reason lucas gets on the bench). Milner and Hendo will take turns having one person push and the other hold based on the situation. The only benefit that having Lucas brings is that you take out lets say lallana for the added benefit of having milner and hendo attack centrally every attack, and having coutinho in the left and Ibe on the right. The issue with this is that Coutinho(imo best player) plays better behind the front three( as seen in the season where we came 2nd), as opposed to the wing, and what Hendo and milner individually bring to a defense might not be as good as Lucas but the team is overall better because we have more quality on the pitch. 


 &gt;I'm thinking here in terms of 433, where you have a holding midfield and two wingers

I'm assuming you're benching Ibe then because what's the point of having two wingers, plus you don't have anyone having coming in late to the box( I guess it's the other CM).

There are lots of ways of doing it but my main point is we don't need a DM.

This myth is great.

Even if we just look at the company in the example we can prove it's not true.

EY is a huge accountancy firm and there's basically only a handful of types of roles HR would be involved in hiring. 

If they hired Directors or Partners externally that would be done almost 100% by the Partners themselves and HR would have nothing to do with it.

Beyond that it's basically managers, seniors, and staff. HR doesn't decide the job description, the Partners for the various areas decide what qualifications they are looking for.

When you turn up to interview at one of these firms you are interviewed by two managers, both of which do the job you're doing. After that there is a second stage interview with two Directors/Partners, both of which have done your job for years.

The only thing you've said there that's true is that yes they do whittle down suitable candidates in a relatively arbitrary manner. I have a 2:2 as my degree but I performed very well in my interview and competency test, so well in fact the Partner offered me a job in my interview (I work for a similar firm). Yet in order to apply as a graduate, that is a job lower than mine and no experience expected, I'd have been rejected as I didn't have a 2:1.

But yeah the idea that job specs are thrown together by people in HR who have no idea what they are doing is fucking funny. Every single HR department I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot in my job) is very quick to hand off responsibility of job descriptions etc to the hiring manager. HR will be the first to tell you they are not there to make decisions, they are there to support and advise. If you get ridiculous job ads that ask for way too much experience for not enough pay it's probably the hiring manager's fault. They know their own budget and they probably set their own job descriptions.",null,0,null,1438898543,null,null,false,0,ctu3w8l,null,t3_3fzf6f,null,null,null,t1_cttgp4b,null,null,null,1440326280,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,null,Riddla26,eng-manchester,Manchester - City Of Science,null,"I agree with you on the piracy thing, I do not in any way think piracy is any way for anyone to behave. Semantic arguments aside it's consuming something that you did not pay for that usually carries a price. For me whether that's copying or stealing is a null and void argument. However your comment does raise some serious questions about your seemingly bleak picture for people who buy things legally, as that view also needs to step into the digital age alongside the content producers.

&gt; Forever. Yes, it's £5.99 a month, but that's for life.

I mean... it's not. It's until you don't want to use it any more. No more, no less.

Frankly with the prices of buying DVD box sets, or even a DVD flat out costing more than a tenner... Netflix is a fucking good deal if you watch 2 movies a week. It's not like 99% of people buy a DVD, watch it, then continually watch it over and over. No, it sits there and gathers dust for a LONG ass time. Netflix removes that requirement and people are very happy to pay less for more content in that regard.

I mean what's your angle here? For a consumer of movies / TV shows, your £4k figure over a lifetime is a *laughable* underestimation of how much shit people actually buy, especially if they're a movie buff. Ditto goes for music and their subscription.

I mean really, what is it you're getting at? That we should fuck off all online services and go back to good ole' DVD and CD? Fuck that noise. I pay my £5.99 a month for Netflix and watch several movies per week - net result. If I find at a point in my life I'm not watching many movies, I'll cancel it. If I want it again... guess what? I'm free to start paying them again. Ditto for Google Play Music All Access. I pay £7 a month to them too and I ABSOLUTELY listen to FAR more music that I've never heard than that £7 is worth, especially if you consider it's about £14 for a new album on CD these days. If I'm not listening to music... I cancel!

&gt;And when a person dies noone can benefit from buying their stuff on the cheap from a charity store.

No, but they can subscribe to the same services for less than the retail price of the item and enjoy much newer movies / music. In fact they can also enjoy the SAME movies / music, just with newer stuff on top, whenever they feel like it.

&gt;This kills the second hand market.

Yes. That is a side effect, there is no denying it. But considering the value for money that these first sale services provide is that really a bad thing? I mean you could pick up a £20 DVD, 6 months after release for about £8, but why would you when you can pay £8 to watch it on Netflix along with their entire library? Given the pricing model of subscription services it literally makes no sense to keep supporting the second hand market. That is good for content producers yes, but it's also an important step towards having them realise that people don't WANT to pay silly money to buy their latest DVD or CD, they don't WANT to have to go out, find it, buy it and take it home. They want to see it, go ""ooh"", click it and watch/listen. The vast majority of the changes to law that we're seeing now are coming off the back off the wave of utter dinosaurs in the industry that completely refuse to accept the fact that, if provided in an easy to access way (online) at a reasonable price that people *will* pay for their content. It's as simple as that. They want to strangle the bogeyman of piracy so they can keep on fucking us in the ass with physical media prices and fucking the cinema and music industries by delaying the release of various things across the globe for 6 months ""because reasons"".

Why the fuck should we accept that, given the new technology available, it's still perfectly reasonable to release something in North America, then (usually) 6 weeks later for music and 3 months later for films release them to the rest of the world? Fuck that noise.

&gt;You can keep charging full price for your old rope because 'used' product will cease to exist.

Maybe in these two markets, sure, but that's not going to mean you're going to be renting your bananas from Tescos in 5 years time. We already rent houses, cars, train and aeroplane travel, because we want to use them for a certain period of time and then stop without having to worry about what happens to them after we leave. Music and movies are absolutely no different. They are for a huge majority of people consumables that, once consumed, then withhold no value anyway.

&gt;Digital products are amazing, but they are being used to take control away from us.

Allowing you instant access to hundreds of thousands of musical works, listen to anything you want in an instant, see movies before the DVDs are released, browsing a library bigger than you could house without building a dedicated room for them is taking ""control"" away from us? Well, bye control, I'll be watching the latest episode of Better Call Saul that was released yesterday.

I mean I understand your concerns, but this is not like it can practically spread to other areas of our lives. I think you really need to take a step back, ease up on the anti-everything gas and observe what these changes really mean.

That's how they are painting it, because it is more palatable to people and the average person thinks £6mil is a lot of money, but it is a tiny, tiny drop in the ocean.

Whatever you might think of the current state of some unions (Fucking tube strikes...), we shouldn't strike down and punish all unions or try to put a stop to them. Now more than ever, whilst labour is plentiful and work is not, we need unions to be belligerent on behalf of workers. Otherwise there really isn't anything stopping the government from pulling all sorts of shit, and corporations too.

The core of it is in his article here:

http://labourlist.org/2015/07/education-is-a-collective-good-its-time-for-a-national-education-service/

Lots of nice words about joined-up thinking, and the following details:

* Reverse cuts to adult skills budgets
* Increase corporation tax 2% to pay for it (but still leaving UK corporation tax the lowest in the G7.)
* Work with Jobcentre Plus to offer claimants opportunities to improve their skills.
* Apprentices must be paid the minimum wage. No poverty rates like the current £2.73 per hour apprenticeship rate.
* Colleges should work in partnership with employers to mutually accredit apprenticeships and courses that offer high quality transferable skills.
* Councils and government agencies should also use public procurement contracts to guarantee good apprenticeships.

In short: Not that much detail, but 4 years away from an election is as good a time as any to introduce grand plans than need working through. The Staggers article linked to here highlights some of the issues involved with making it happen are all about implementation (the devil, as ever, is in the detail).

&gt; There are four main types of FGM:

 &gt; Type 1 – clitoridectomy – removing part or all of the clitoris.

 &gt; Type 2 – excision – removing part or all of the clitoris and the inner labia (lips that surround the vagina), with or without removal of the labia majora (larger outer lips).

&gt; Type 3 – infibulation – narrowing of the vaginal opening by creating a seal, formed by cutting and repositioning the labia.

&gt; Other harmful procedures to the female genitals, which include pricking, piercing, cutting, scraping and burning the area.


When *type 1* means removal of the clitoris, it's a really big deal. If male circumcision involved removing the whole head of the penis, you'd be damn sure people would be shouting about it.

I did and homeopathy is water with memory - don't think so, it's complete and utter bullshit practiced by charlatans and people without even a primary school understanding of science or the scientific method. The whole premise of homeopathy is so stupid that it doesn't even deserve looking at and yet, it's been studied extensively and been shown to be useless beyond placebo. Giving someone placebo and pretending it has some sort of other magical efficacy is dishonest.

&gt;Collectively they failed to provide strong evidence in favour of homeopathy. In particular, there was no condition which responds convincingly better to homeopathic treatment than to placebo or other control interventions. Similarly, there was no homeopathic remedy that was demonstrated to yield clinical effects that are convincingly different from placebo. It is concluded that the best clinical evidence for homeopathy available to date does not warrant positive recommendations for its use in clinical practice.

First half we were rather shit. Logan crosses were terrible and shinnie wasn't getting the ball enough. Should of had a pen (which we I can almost guarantee now from the UEFA official)   also amazed how the blond CD made it to the the end of the first half and not get send off after yellow in first 15 mins. The other CD was on the edge of getting sent off too. 

Then the second half of bullshit. I start with the Goal, started with a bad throw in decision then a obvious foul throw we didn't help ourself with our defences then scored. He spent 2 mins celebration plus in front of our fans now idea how the ref didn't do anything (i can hear the UEFA talking about it at the moment but can't make our a lot )  

After the Goal we seemed to pick up a bit although Taylor looked like the most attacking player on the team which is horrible. 
McLean getting another goal is a good sign at least showing why he was worth the money.

Well, the entire point of unions is to provide collective bargaining power for the working person. I'm not going to argue as to whether unions are performing their role correctly at the moment, but I was referencing the theory.

&gt; We should fund them with tax payer money because some people think they work for the good of taxpayer?

that's a straw man. Nobody is suggesting we fund unions from taxes. This is a very small amount of money which provides not only an easy way to pay union dues, but also makes it much easier for everyone in unions to have their dues deducted from their income tax. Even if only half the people in unions claimed their tax returns back, I expect it would cost at least 6million in man hours from HMRC to process all the additional return forms. Factor in as well the cost of the MPs actually wasting their time with this and it isn't saving any money really at all.

&gt; Whatever your political beliefs surely you can see that it is fair TU pay the bill for collecting their subs?

For art supplies mostly you are just able to get most stuff provided by the school for the class to use in lessons, but they never have a problem if you bring your own stuff

School also provides a planner which (for us) you wrote all your homework in &amp; had your parents sign it at the end of the week (because your teachers/form tutor would write messages to your parents in if you had detention or something, it's just to prove that they saw it)

On top of that remember that the vast majority of schools here require kids to have a uniform, so if you're going to a new school/need new uniform you need to get all that as well. If you're interested in that too I'll list it below. For me that was:

Primary school (age 5-11):

- Burgundy jumper with school logo
- Light blue polo shirt
- Grey or black trousers
- Grey or black shoes

Secondary school (11-16):

- Navy blue blazer with school logo
- Light blue button down shirt
- Navy blue &amp; yellow striped tie (school colours)
- Grey or black trousers
- Grey or black shoes
- Grey or black socks

Secondary school PE kit:

- Reversible blue &amp; yellow rugby shirt
- Light fabric sports t-shirt
- Yellow rugby/football socks
- Navy blue shorts
- Trainers 

Usually you can buy those from a uniform shop in your town, or the school also often sells them. With uniform you can usually get away with only rebuying it a couple of times depending on how quick you're growing

Thats an odd comparison because apart from a *very* small blip in '07 we haven't had a per capita GDP as large as the united states since the 1870's. I think you're expecting a bit much if you wanted the tories to sort that out.

As for the Germans, well our GDP per capita fell far more dramatically than theirs during the recession (approx. 48-37K vs 45-41K) so of course we haven't caught up yet. We went FAR deeper into recession, but it's nonsense to say we're not catching up. We are outgrowing the Germany economy by a third (2014).

&gt; All he would be is a judge gone off his rocker, the judge's hands are tied here, it really isn't their fault. Moreover even if they were to do what you suggest, it would get overturned on appeal because of the aforementioned problem.

Probably true, yeah. Still, that would bring more attention to the problem, wouldn't it?

""This law is so pointless and so bad and so far away from anything that could be considered reasonable that even judges are ruling against it.""

That gives concerned citizens and MPs and activists some useful ammunition.

&gt; you'd be risking your career for a move that will get overturned anyway

It's easy for me to say, but I think sometimes, especially at that level, it's *necessary* for people to risk their careers for what's right. Principled politicians [sometimes resign in protest](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2857637.stm) rather than blindly going ahead with their constitutional obligations, and that's exactly how it should be. There should be no job security for a decent man in a senior public service job.

I expect all senior public servants to have serving the public as their highest priority and preserving their own careers as a lower one. That's optimistic and even naive, but nevertheless, I prefer to have high expectations and hope senior people meet them. I expect there are things you wouldn't be willing to do as part of your job, just like there are things I wouldn't do as part of mine, no matter what the law said, or my superiors ordered. I grant judges that same self-determination that we have.

I don't deny that the legislative front is the one to fight on, and that it's ultimately Parliament's job to correct this sort of nonsense. Obviously, I want that to happen and I hope it gets sorted out before too many days (...years...) pass. I just don't let judges off either. In my mind, their first duty is to be good people who can justify their decisions. As in, personally. They should be willing to be personally accountable for whatever decisions they make. If they aren't, they shouldn't be making them.

At the end of the day, everyone is responsible for what he says and does. None of us can disclaim all responsibility and claim to be ""just following orders"", whether we're soldiers or politicians or private citizens or judges.

I also realise, even as I type all this, that these words are far too high and noble (and pompous and pretentious) for a question of whether iTunes is illegal. Nothing related to iTunes can be noble.

&gt; Nope, GBH with intent is willingly harming someone

That's incorrect. 

A section 18 assault, GBH with intent, requires an intention - 

* to cause GBH or;

* to resist or prevent the lawful detention of any person

as held in R v Belfon [1976].

&gt; GBH without intent is things like fights going too far, there wasn't the intention to seriously hurt someone.

I'd agree with that one. You're right in saying that a section 20 assault, GBH, doesn't require an intention to seriously harm someone.

It was held in R v Savage [1991] that ""It was not necessary to demonstrate the defendant had the mens rea in relation to level of harm inflicted. It was sufficient that they intended or could foresee that *some harm** will result.""

*My emphasis.


&gt; GBH has to draw blood or have a similar injury

You're thinking about wounding, which is included in sections 18 and 20, but is actually distinct from GBH. Wounding is a break in the continuity of the skin.

However, this isn't necessary for GBH. For example, in *Dica* [2004], the defendant was convicted of two counts of inflicting GBH after he recklessly transmitted HIV to someone else.

It's also why they didn't need bailing out.

To respond to Flav's question about local support, my ""local"" MLS team is 3 hours away one way, through toll roads and Illinois roadwork that could well turn that 3 hours into 5, with essentially no viable public transportation because our Governor [did some stuff](http://www.isthmus.com/news/opinion/you-thought-wisconsin-losing-high-speed-rail-was-bad/) to cancel a high speed rail line and get elected. Still bitter about that one and the $118 million we're in the hole because of cancelling it.

Anyway, because of this, for a lot of us in the states, our ""local"" MLS team might as well be based in England for how easy they are to see. [This map might help](http://www.businessinsider.com/half-of-the-united-states-lives-in-these-counties-2013-9) if you compare it with [this map](http://northlandnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/mlsmapSKCstaysInEast.jpg), and then note that the distance from the little blue dot in the middle of Wisconsin to Chicago is a 3 hour drive. A little under half of us live near a MLS team. The other half are nowhere near as lucky. Many fans are going to need to drive essentially the full length+ of the UK in order to reach a game. Premier League teams are much easier to catch on TV or to find streams of, they have a much larger online community, and you're likely to actually run into one or two fans in the wild if you put on some team gear. Plus, the quality of play is superior to MLS. MLS is improving, but it's going to take a lot longer to catch up.

Also, you guys get 28 days of mandatory vacation a year, while many Americans are lucky to get weekends off. It's not easy to support a team that you'd have to take a day off work to see if you can't actually take a day off work. This isn't universally the case and many Americans do have some vacation time they can use, but some of our employers/state governments are moving toward cutting weekends/days off back.

I do support my local team, the [Madison 56ers](http://npsl.madison56ers.org/), but they play a [whopping 6](http://npsl.madison56ers.org/Schedule.aspx) regular season games in Madison, with away games taking place in towns even further away than Chicago, with just as much public transportation connecting us. A lot of those games also take place during the summer transfer window, so my support of Spurs doesn't conflict with my support of my local club, since it's very seldom that I'd have to pick between one or the other.",null,0,null,1438903782,null,null,1438905371,0,ctu7403,null,t3_3g0yx5,null,null,null,t3_3g0yx5,null,null,null,1440327795,null,4,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,4,null

null,null,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt; That's why they involve huge amounts of money - because the big pensions schemes want their investments to be low-mid risk with a reaosnably stable return. Not high-stakes investments.

I'm against the very notion of people's pensions being used as way for hedge funds to make money - the privatization of pensions and tying the fate of milllions of elderly people to the behaviour of these rapacious hedge funds is itself a disgrace.

Without the banking bailouts the value of the assetts and investments these hedge funds are invested in would be much worse. The ""safe"" hedge fund, the nice responsible capitalist tycoon, and the ""unsafe"" investment bank with their derivatives and arcane securities do not exist in some mutually exclusive sphere, seperate from one another. They're two cheeks on the same arse.

I would like very much for people's pensions to be taken out of their control, which they simply use as capital to enrich themselves, we only have to go back to 2008 to see how allowing the line between commercial investment banking and personal banking as a social utility can lead to disaster. 

Furthermore they use pension money as a source of capital safe in the knowledge that whenever shit hits the fan because this is a vital social utility that people need to survive their old age that no matter how fucked up things get the state will be there bail them out. That applies to hedge funds too btw, why do you think hedge funds drawn to ""safe"" sources of capital like people's pensions?

No, the whole rotten architecture of finance capitalism (and capitalism itself, but let's stick to the topic...) needs bringing down. An entirely new banking system, democratically run, publicly owned, accountable and open for scrutiny, where there's a strong firewall between private investment banking (which hopefully would be a dying trade) and personal banking. This could take the form of new types of socially owned banks and credit unions to take on the day to day functions of having a bank account, non profit ideally. All the little sinecures and old boys networks, the privileges of the City of London corporation, the tax havens in places like the Isle of Man, Channel Islands, Turks and Caicos, Bermuda etc etc shut be should down and replaced with banking as a utility.

Fact is, from a signally perspective many of the London tube lines are essentially driverless, all the driver does is check the doors are clear and press a button, there are lots of driverless subways around the world. 

Things like the DLR say they're driverless but they still have a ""train captain"" on every train, in the case of the DLR this is largely because of public perceptions of driverless trains. 

The RMT claim drivers are essential on the underground because if there is an emergency on the train and people need to leave then the driver is supposedly trained to deal with the situation. Reality is, this basically never happens, the last time it did was 7/7 and the driver was completely unable to do anything because his train had just exploded. What is actually required is better signposting and escape routes on deep lines, that would have actually been useful during 7/7, more useful than having a driver. This can be achieved, but it is expensive, this is probably the biggest barrier to driverless.

The cost is not marginal, platforms are already staffed with people could easily check no one is hanging out of doors, getting rid of the drivers would lower costs and also stop strikes! 

Now I don't think we should sack all the tube drivers, that would be unfair, but at the very least I think they should freeze recruitment, and then automate lines as drivers retire over the next 50 years or so.

No it isn't a good reason not to bail them out. Not unless you're in favour of fucking over the average man on the street who's current account just vanished and now has *literally* no money to pay the rent or buy food.

And it's also not a reason not to sell. You make no sense.

They shunt 5% of their stock. That will mean their new, lower holding qualifies them as a permitted investment for more buyers than would touch them previously - demand goes up, along with price (currently at 348p).

Shift a few more shares, some more investors now include you in their ""approved stocks"" list, price rises further.

By the time you hit 50% ownership, everyone (including the biggest investors) is interested because it's no longer government-controlled. Share price rises further.

Also, don't expect the share price to hit 501p again. Sections of RBS have been spun out and sold off as separate businesses. The government isn't just deriving income from the share sales of RBS, but from the sales of other business units. They're about to spin out 600 branches into the all-new Williams and Glyn bank. RBS isn't going to get back to 501p because it's a *smaller business by 600 branches!* But W&amp;G isn't worthless. When that is spun out as a separate entity, it will attract income from the investors who buy shares in W&amp;G. Just because RBS shares are going for less than 501p doesn't mean they're making a loss of [501-current price], because *the difference includes business units that have been stripped out and separated* - farming Investment Banking away from Retail banking for instance, so that trading losses can't threaten people's savings and mortgages as they did in 2008.

If he's got no positional awareness (and to be honest I wouldn't expect his positioning to be top notch considering he was being asked to play a totally different role than what he's been used to) but if he's got terrible positional awareness as you claim, how did he somehow manage to be in position to make more tackles on average than anyone else in the team?

I guess my point is your comment make absolutely no logical sense. How could the player who on average out tackled every other player in the squad be a liability defensively? 

Never mind the fact that Pochettino obviously thought he was the best option, and we'll completely forget the praise he received from pundits, and the fact he was called up to the national squad must just be a figment of the imagination.

My favourites of *New Who*:

1) **Steven Moffat** - absolutely stellar. *Blink*, *The Impossible Astronaut*, *The Eleventh Hour*, *The Day Of The Doctor* - these are the episodes I watch for.
2) **Neil Gaiman** - obviously Moffat's superior, but only has one great story for the show so far.
3) **RTD** - I wasn't a particular fan of his storytelling style, but he could thrash out a script. *Midnight*, *The Waters Of Mars*, and *Turn Left* are out of the top drawer, plus he has several other good stories. More than his fair share of duds, mind.
4) **Toby Whithouse** - excellent dialogue in all his episodes, and all have been solid concepts executed well. I guess my criticism of him would be that none of his episodes have made me go ""wow"" - they've all just been solid 8/10s. *The God Complex* is his best.
5) **Paul Cornell** - the *Human Nature* two parter is godly, and *Father's Day* is pretty good, one of the few Rose episodes I'd consider re-watching.

&gt;By the time you hit 50% ownership, everyone (including the biggest investors) is interested because it's no longer

They way it's set up is that the price of the shares has an effectively got a type of ceiling in place, meaning that it's basically impossble for the taxpayers to get good value for money out of the sale.

“So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go. At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight. When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold. He said to her, ‘Get up; let’s go.’ But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home.” (Judges 19:25-28)

I understand what you're saying, as the majority of our posters are loose-leaf only drinkers. We started doing simple discussion/question threads a year or two ago with the hopes of having a safe(r) place for these type of questions. That never really took off, for whatever reason. We try not to over-police the subreddit; we're not big fans of the censorship that a lot of the big subs have.

Though, this is an issue with a lot of subs/forums. The majority of people who visit are going to be those who actively searched for it, so they're likely enthusiasts. Then of those, the ones that post new threads are typically the most passionate. If you visit /r/games, you don't get much discussion on Facebook/Web/phone games. If you visit /r/soccer, you see mostly pro leagues. This is different from a lot of default subs, where users don't have to actively seek out the subreddits.

Exactly my thoughts on Rodgers and last season. I think a lot of people left the season with a bad taste in their mouth following the drubbing at Stoke. Last season was one giant ""worst case scenario"", with absolutely everything going wrong. Defense was spastic, injuries (with most of the emphasis being on Sturridge), and strikers who simply could not score. All of that being the case, the Friday the day before the rout at Stoke, we were 5th. A few weeks prior, we still had a prayer of coming in 4th. 4th would have been an amazing result given the circumstances, and I think many people would have been fine with 5th (we got 6th, I think our players were simply done with our season going into the last couple weeks).  
  
Of course I'm optimistic, I support Liverpool and they give us lots of reasons to be so. While this optimism may not always be rewarded, it certainly gives us a reason to support our players through thick and thin.  
  
This premier league season will be lots of fun with the squads last year's top six have assembled.

Knowing and doing are two different things, though. In particular with things like threading, you really need experience to ""know your limits"" because it's very easy to bite off more than you can chew and create something that works 99% of the time, but is totally beyond your ability to debug (speaking from painful experience).

One of my biggest problems with universities is they generally teach students very simplified, old-school and often out of date ways of handling problems like these, and the result is people naively jumping in and getting bitten.

Not to mention 90% of academics couldn't handle a software project to save their lives. Their remit is generally to write code that works once, one time, on one system, and then throw it away and never look at it again (and generally only they will look at the code, no-one else has to work on it or understand it). In a commercial sitting your mission is to write software that works every time, often on multiple machines, and to keep changing it and fixing bugs and adding features.

He helped us make signings that the vast majority of Spurs supporters thought would work out. It's an absolute shame that they did not but I would not blame Franco.

We are willing to see how Lamela does but attack Soldado for how bad he's been. Both might be fair, but I think Franco tried hard to make us better. If that did not work out then I would not hold it against him. I remember Commoli being attacked once he left Liverpool for all his fuck ups there but he signed them Suarez and signed us Bale, BAE, Modric and Pav. 

I remember this sub being phenomenally excited about Soldado, Lamela and Paulinho, as they should have been. It's sad that them, along with the other signings, haven't provided like we thought but the man was part of our club and let's respect his effort.

Now with Paul Mitchell we'll see a new approach and hopefully that will help us. In saying that we all want a big-performance DM but who would that be?

null,null,andreww631,null,null,null,"&gt; Yeah so lets continue to ignore the fact that our coaches (who study the performances for a living) thought Mason did a good enough job to warrant starting over pretty much everyone else for the majority of the season.

Ok so let's never debate anything here ever again. They must always be right and are completely infallible.

&gt; 
Lets also ignore the fact that the national team coaches (who also study the performances for a living) thought he'd done a good enough job to play for the national team.

The English national team has also called up Livermore and Shelvey in recent years.

&gt; Having said all that, I will agree that he struggled tracking runners. But you have to remember that was his first season playing that role. He's more used to playing higher up the pitch and I have no doubt he will have improved that part of his game. Essentially it's like playing Eriksen deep in the midfield and then calling him a terrible player because his defending isn't up to the standards of Phillipp Lahm

He has played as a deeper cm for a while actually. He's been playing that position on most if not all of his loan spells. No one expects him to be Philip Lahm but the reality is that he is legitemately not up to pl standards defensively. Just watch our games back, he is never in position. There's a reason our defence was so bad last season, and he's a big part of it

If you are okay with seeing his last serial first then definitely check out The War Games as it is the closest you will probably get to a Series 6 Matt Smith style overarching arc filled with mysteries and twists.

If you want a quirky Doctor with some seriousness and an overarching story you could try Season 12 which sees the Fourth Doctor working with a female companion, Sarah Jane, and a male companion, Harry Sullivan. Although the two companions are not in a relationship the dynamic is kind of similar where the Fourth Doctor kind of cares for Sarah at the expense of Harry. The season has more of a Series 5 Matt Smith arc where there is a general sense of connection (through the Nerva beacon) but is mostly standalone. If you want a slightly more connected arc (although it is not nearly as connected or strong as modern arcs) you could try Season 16 which sees the Fourth Doctor and his new companion Romana searching for the Key to Time which is comprised of six pieces scattered across the universe.",null,0,null,1438919446,null,null,1438921904,0,ctufrv9,null,t3_3g2s2q,null,null,null,t1_ctuf5p4,null,null,null,1440331942,null,4,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4,null

null,null,GreenLightatNoon,null,null,null,"Alright guys, let’s be honest:
This sub has been looking a little pessimistic over the last couple of weeks. Scary new signings made by United (who have no choice but to improve, we’ve had it pretty easy with them not contending the last couple of seasons) City (who seem to go through top players like Bekham does underwear) and Arsenal (who, come on, I mean, really.. they’re just going to mess it up anyway – remember when Ozil was the answer to all their problems? –) have made us all a bit nervous. 
But why are we turning on the team that waltzed through the league last year?

Mourinho has made like-for-like signings who are happy to be rotational players. This is good. The spotlight has turned on our up and coming youth players who will be competitive (at the least!) and force the starting XI to perform to hold onto their place within the line-up. Also good.
Our pre-season has been wobbly but we don’t know exactly what Mourniho wanted from those games. And he is always a man with a plan. 


Point being, we really should be rather optimistic about this season. Costa is deadly, if he doesn’t get injured he’ll be close to being the top scorer of this season, count on that. Hazard proved what he could do last year, getting better and better each season, this season will be no different. Oscar is rested, doubt him all you want but his creativity is something special, even on the days when he looked bored (tired) he could make something from nothing. Cesc played two roles last season (first deep, then high) this season looks like he’ll be more situated. Our back line is solid. **SOLID.**  Unlike so many other teams; new signing will add depth.


Come on guys, fans cheer their team on. Believe in them. We have so much to be happy with but other teams trying to make themselves as deadly as us, as brilliant as us, has made us think we’re falling behind.


**WE** are the benchmark.

**WE** are the champions.

**WE WILL BE SENSATIONAL.**

Russia and China are modernising their arsenals right now, and even adding newer delivery mechanisms. China are adding long range nuclear capable bombers. Russia are upgrading their ICBMs. And who else do we have - Pakistan and India - who hate each other. North Korea - who are fucking crazy. And Israel - who are aggressive little shits with no interest in peace, and who won't even acknowledge their weapons or sign the NPT. 

From the UK point of view, France and the UK having nukes is the best available protection of Europe. Otherwise we rely on the Americans, who are already losing interest in Europe and will 'pivot to Asia' over the next decade. Nuclear armed France and UK is the best defence against Russian aggression, if it were to occur. 

Nuclear weapons are bad. But the UK is a stable and responsible country, unlike most of the other countries who have them. Furthermore, we can't UN-invent or forget the technology. So while disarmament is desirable, it's pretty much impossible to stop states from developing them. 

I would finish by saying that 2015 is a pretty peaceful time. It's 70 years since the last massive war. But we shouldn't be complacent and assume that this will always continue. There are still many challenges ahead - global warming, energy crisis, resource shortages etc - all of which can lead to territorial disputes that spill over into war. Things can change quickly, and nuclear weapons are a good insurance policy which ensures protection of the UK.

Payet looks like the real deal and will be huge for us this season, Zarate looks very handy and versatile and will definitely play an important role. Reece Burke and Reece Oxford are the 2 best hammers we've had in a very long time and Josh Cullen is showing great potential.

There are a few heavily connected stories in some seasons like Season 16 (*The Key to Time*) or Season 23 (*The Trial of a Timelord*), and also a few mini-arcs like the E-Space trilogy or the Turlough / Black Guardian trilogy.

What I really liked about watching it in order was the little bits of continuity and development in the characters.  Things like knowing how the companions joined the Doctor, what they've been through while travelling, and seeing how that has affected their character growth.  It's not as noticeable as in the revived series, but it let's me get more attached to the characters.  There's also some fun stuff like watching the Master mess with the Doctor for a whole season.

I watched it in order up to *The Dalek Invasion of Earth* before jumping to *Spearhead from Space* (I was getting tired of reconstructions).

They re-aired it again and the pilot caught on like crazy. 
Episodes aren't in the usual format; An adventure could take anywhere from 3-8 'episodes from any length of time. Because the BBC had a bad habit in their way of storying their film reels back in the day, a handful of episodes are completely lost, while some are missing parts. Some have only audio. It's still worth watching, as you can see the transition to each new regeneration, how quirks, mannerisms, and personality of each incarnation of the Doctor still shows up in later ones. You see new worlds at first then new time periods. The Time Lords make their appearance, the first appearance of The Master, etc.,.......

The clinics were found to not be at fault so the patients (and to some extent the NHS) had to pay to remove and/or replace those dodgy implants.

Germany doesn't have nuclear weapons for historic reasons which you might be familiar with...

Secondly, ok, many countries don't have nuclear weapons. But the largest and most powerful countries do (and the UK is one of those). Furthermore, there hasn't been a major war since WW2 - quite possibly BECAUSE of the threat of nuclear annihilation. 

And lastly, countries without nuclear weapons (such as Germany) are protected by countries who do - such as the U.S., UK and France - all of whom protect Germany under NATO agreements. If the UK gets rid of our arsenal, there will only be France to prop up Europe. The U.S. is somewhat losing interest in Europe now. 

And as I said before, you can't forget how to make them or uninvent the technology. So while a nuclear weapon free world is obviously desirable, you can't really stop countries from developing them in secret. That would then give them a massive geopolitical advantage over everybody else. It also pretty much ensures that nobody will disarm. If Russia said 'ok, we got rid of all nukes', would you even believe them? Maybe they just kept 100 in secret- who knows!

The current situation isn't ideal, but it is working pretty well so far. However, we need to maintain and modernise our capabilities for the future too. 

Edit: also, I would mention that if shit hit the fan, non-nuclear countries will quickly be made the bitch of nuclear countries. Nuclear weapons mean a lot of bargaining power.

null,null,bottomlines,null,null,null,"Basically, if you earn 100k, you're going to pay a lot of tax, right?

Your income is 100k. Your taxable income is that 100k minus the tax free allowance, which is about 10k. So you have 90k of taxable income, and you'll pay 30% or so. So you take home 60k. 

However, you can put income into a pension which is then deducted from your taxable income. 

So if you earn 100k, you put 50k into a pension. Now your taxable income is only 40k (100 -10 -40). And you pay a lot less tax on 40k than you do on the 90k. 

And basically, when you retire, your income drops. Then you can draw out your pension and pay tax on it - at a much lower rate. Maybe you take 30k per year of pension, and you'll only pay a little bit of tax. 

In short, a pension allows you to defer income tax, so that you can pay it after retirement when you are earning less. 

By limiting pension contributions of higher earners, the government are going to make you pay a lot more tax straight away because you can't defer it.

It's important you know what the current threat level is as you're saying goodbye to everyone you ever knew.

It won't make survival any more likely, but it will mean the streets won't be unnecessarily cluttered with charred corpses.

The military will definitely foil this attack on our sovereignty by driving up and down the road.

Guess you probably shouldn't have ended that last conversation by being a cunt. Still, that memory won't haunt you for long, so there's always that.

One side says staff can opt out of night shifts after a transition period with no one being forced to work more hours than they are currently, and the other saying that they don't trust them to do so.

I fully sympathise with the RMT. They know that technology will eventually lower the amount of staff needed and many jobs will be redundant. We inevitably will have massive cutbacks on station staff, tube drivers and a 24/7 service in the future. We've already seen cutbacks on station staff due to ticketing machines (not exactly unbelievable). Once the tube is mainly automated to the level of the DLR in the next two decades I'd expect a drop in wages of drivers to closer to median levels given their responsibility lessens.

The issue with the RMT is that they are terrible at conveying their plight to the average commuter.

First though I want to understand what you meant. Let me home in on something. I'm not sure what you mean by ""way of life"".

Are you saying that you thought your IT degree would had lead you into a job - a ""geeky"" job - that would have been somehow incompatible with the type of life you wanted to lead? I don't think that's really the case. Some employers are crazy about work hours but many are not - this isn't America or Japan, where even tech workers have very few rights at work.

Or are you saying something broader, that you didn't want to pursue a degree at all, or that you didn't want to pursue a traditional career?

But I think I've gotten hold of the wrong end of the stick, because what's that got to do with being introverted? About half the population is introverted. It's a fairly broad category.

I've got a DIP for 180k, our top end houses are 230k which means...

Can afford 50k and have this to hand.


How much do I live on... This is where things get cloudy, my girlfriend is paying back a debt to me of at 150 a month. I cleared her DMP last year. Currently my deposit gives me a bit of a insurance regarding ""if things got bad"", she's doing a PhD which is paid from September. My total outgoings are about 1200 (including rent), incoming is about 2700 (which includes my job and the money she pays me and food etc). I also juggle my money between multiple current accounts to maximise on the interest.


Looking for I assume capital mortgage?

Will it be easier for me to put all this money into one account for clarity? I assume they'd want to see multiple statements with all the cash in anyway? Should I take an excel spreadsheet to make this easier to understand? The basics are I can afford the repayments on my own, but my partners paying half which makes them easily affordable; in 3 years time she's going to join me in the mortgage once her credit rating and job are stable.

Had a nightmare where my dead mum was entombed in a convertible Cadillac, which was in the middle of a pizza restaurant. So I'm eating pizza and I'm all 'alright mum?' and obviously she says nothing. Either way, this is a chill part of the dream. 


Then someone screams and says 'There's a hole in the convertibles roof!'

So I go over and have a look and there's 2 foot shapes holes and a knob shaped one. Someone's fucking stood on the roof of the car and pissed on my mum. 

So I'm pretty angry, as would be expected, and there's a little mystery 'who done it' part of the dream. 

Then I look under the car and fucking Jamie Oliver is under there having a wank. When I ask him what the fuck he's doing he goes mental and starts fighting me. Every punch I throw, he throws one harder, so I'm reluctant to throw punches even though I'm real angry and he fucking deserves it. 

Last half of the dream is me sitting eating pizza and Jamie Oliver is just standing next to me (now the Bo Selecta version) berating my pizza for being shit.

Yeah, we know. But the vast majority of people inconvenienced by the train drivers, who aren't satisfied with their pay and conditions including the 52 holidays per year allowance, get substantially fewer holidays than that.

&gt;2. Not all train staff have 52 days holiday

Yeah, we know. Not everyone who works in banking is on hundreds of thousands a year and receives multi million bonuses. Didn't stop any of them being villified for being succesful after years of hard work, training and qualifications. And no, they weren't just villified for the crisis, there is a longstanding campaign to reduce how much city workers are paid. A campaign, I might note, which was backed by the unions.

&gt;3. Not all tube staff are drivers – most earn nothing like £50,000

Yeah, we know. See 2.

&gt;4. If you want more holiday time or pay, join or form a trade union

Get a fucking grip. The Underground workers can only command these benefits because they get to hold one of the greatest cities on Earth to ransom. Joe Bloggs and company who all work at Tesco, all with more demanding jobs than train drivers', can't decide they're going to be paid £50k and have 52 weeks holiday per year because Tesco will shut down the shop in a flash. And if the whole of Tesco unionised and demanded those conditions? Tesco would go out of business as no one could afford to shop there any more. This is what it's like living in the real world.

These people, like leftfootforward, do my head in. They think that everyone else is stupid, weakwilled and gormless.

null,null,iliveintexas,null,null,null,"&gt; I followed 08 and 12 quite closely, mainly because I wanted Bush gone, and then Obama to remain.

2008 was really magical for the reason of Bush's unpopularity--much different than any other election. I would love to get that atmosphere again.

&gt; But now, I want to see neither Bush nor Clinton up for presidency. I'm pretty sure I'm pro Democrat, and definitely anti-Republican so I'm just gonna hope for that unless I feel that both candidates are stupid.

The prospects of having 24 of 32 years of US leadership from 2 immediate families speaks to a real failure in democracy. These kind of things happen in 3rd world dictatorships, not first world countries.

&gt; Also, I find it incredibly dim-witted how much congress is basically run by businesses and your president has no real power. The fact that 3 members of the same family are able to run for presidency over the span of 30 years without much competition is a symbol of how wrong things are in your system.

The president's power can vary greatly depending on the issue. For anything military/defense related, the president can act with more authority than any other individual in the world. The president can also appoint/remove judges and agency heads, which yield considerable power. But for policy matters, the President is still dependent on Congress.

&gt; Our FPTP system is flawed, but we produce stable governments that get things done. 

The U.S. system is inherently very slow in how it's designed, but with respect to industries, fast change in government policies can spell a lot of uncertainty. I think the slow pace of change can be a plus for economic development, at the expense of citizen satisfaction for non-economic issues. So, it's a doubled edged sword.

&gt; Our debate system might be a joke, but we do debate. And even if the PM gets out voted, he still has a bypass mechanism to get things into law, as was the case for the Iraq war (which I disagree with).

I admire how often you have debates on serious issues. Presidential elections are the only time we get to see real debates in US politics. At any other time, the only ""debate"" is silo'ed speeches, ""debate"" on the floor of the legislature, or cable news shows. Few politicians ever face off on the issues.",null,0,null,1438936621,null,null,false,0,ctuluf3,null,t3_3g3qe1,null,null,null,t1_ctukte2,null,null,null,1440334868,null,2,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

null,null,scuzzmonkey69,null,null,null,"&gt; But you're not addressing my point either: namely that they had to be saved - hence bailout, not investment.

I did address it, see here: 

&gt; RBS was too big to fail and to minimise the effect on the economy the Government had to bail them out, that is undeniable.

The fact they had to be bailed out is absolutely undeniable - but as I've said the method of how they were bailed out is something that can, and should, be discussed. Structuring the bail out the way they did is a choice that would have had a reason.

&gt; Holding on to the shares doesn't make sense when they could use the money as a government now while they are in power. It's too risky not to sell since it's hard to say that 5 years will be enough to turn a huge bank around.

There's no time limit here beyond one's they have imposed themselves. The share price has been largely static for the past 6 years, with the Cons being in power for the vast majority of that. Again, should the bank be returned to private hands? Absolutely. When does that happen? Well, that's up for debate.

If Osborne is happy to lose $1b (an actual loss now the 5% shares have been sold, not just an imaginary loss) then the question has to be, Why?

&gt; Another is to relax the supervision in light of the all the existing squeeze and tension and let the business restore itself (as markets like to do, and tend to be good at, more free from political pressures).

The Vietnam RoE were written with the political and diplomatic consequences in mind (after all, the US Congress never formally declared war), rather than any consideration of what US fighters could and could not do. Positive visual identification of enemy targets was always required.

&gt; To use your own analogy

It wasn't an analogy: it is *literally* vacuum tubes vs. microchips. Yes, missiles now like then are held by explosive bolts, propelled by a rocket motor, their fins are controlled by servos (although thrust vectoring is much more of a thing now than then) and have similar explosive charges and detonators. There has been a half century of technical development since, which certainly have improved their reliability and efficiency, but the fundamentals there remain the same.

What has changed completely, however, are the eyes and brains of aircraft and missile. The electronics of Vietnam-era air-to-air radars and missiles were analog and mostly based on vacuum tubes: the F-4 Phantom, for instance, started being equipped with all-solid-state radar electronics only from 1966-1967. Digital electronics only found their way into radars and missiles from the late 1970s onwards.

The result is that Vietnam-era air-to-air radars and missiles were not awfully useful. The air-to-air radars couldn't look down, or track multiple targets simultaneously. The radar-guided early-generation [AIM-7 Sparrows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM-7_Sparrow) had only [semi-active radar homing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-active_radar_homing), meaning that the fighters couldn't just ""[fire and forget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire-and-forget)"", but had instead to keep illuminating the target with their own radar until it was hit by the missile. Their guidance system was pretty poor, too, resulting in a less than 10% kill rate. [Vietnam-era IR-guided AIM-9 Sidewinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM-9_Sidewinder), although not quite as useless as the radar-guided Sparrows, were also very inferior to later versions: they could not lock or track a head-on target, and were easily fooled by flares, or even the sun. Modern electronics completely changed things there. [This first became apparent with the use of the all-aspect AIM-9L version in the Falklands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM-9_Sidewinder#AIM-9L), where there was a jump from a 10-15% to an 80% kill rate.",null,0,null,1438937429,null,null,1438937639,0,ctulzb9,null,t3_3fyya7,null,null,null,t1_cttstgo,null,null,null,1440334933,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,null,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt; Me? I'm the one fucking over the average man in the street because I refuse to publicly fund private sector incompetence and fraud?
&gt; 
&gt; Wouldn't the responsibility for fucking over the average man in the street (who's pocket you're picking to bail them out btw) lie with the banks who went bust, not the people who refuse to hand over countless amounts of other people's money to bail them out?

This is a variation on the [trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem).

A *retail* bank is going bust.

The government is in a position to save it.

* If it saves it, it will be at a loss, and damage public finances - not irreparably, but for some time to come.

* If it does not save it, millions of people will suddenly find their cards do not work. They will be unable to pay their rent or buy food because their accounts just got wiped out. Tens of thousands of companies would also find their corporate accounts no longer existed - everything from big multinationals through to mom-and-pop shops. You're looking at messy slews of foreclosures in the style of Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac.

Businesses can't process payroll or buy raw materials because their bank account no longer exists, along with all the money in it. Not that it matters because half their staff don't have a bank account to pay into anyway.

The knock-on effect to the country would be catastrophic. Multiple major bankruptcies, hundreds of thousands of people out of work. Foreclosures left, right and centre.

In the Trolley Problem, ultimate culpability lies with whoever tied the people to the track, but that doesn't mean the person who can throw the switch doesn't have an ethical choice to make (and not throwing the switch is a choice in itself). By choosing not to throw the switch, when they *could*, the Government accepts partial responsibility for all those people getting screwed over. The government - and the BoE - exists precisely to manage these things, and to provide a level of under-writing.

And since then, they're regulated to separate out Investment and Retail. You're so obsessed and focussed with a handful of investment bankers in the Square Mile that you forget that the vast majority of banking involves *regular people paying in their wage slip and being able to use their bank card in Tesco*.

**Allowing** their savings and current accounts to vanish, **allowing** untold misery to fall upon millions of people through no fault of their own would be a truly evil thing to do. Which is why the government intervened.

The (Labour) government chose not to cause national chaos. The Tory government is now trying to sort out the (lesser evil) financial implications it caused.

&gt; The rest of your post, pointing to the technical reasons why the taxpayer got screwed, doesn't alter the fact the outcome was a yet another taxpayer subsidised gift to the financial services industry, which just so happens to own the Tory party outright. 

The Tory party didn't bail out RBS. They had no part to play in the causation of this mess (unless you want to go back to early 90s financial policy, but Labour had 13 years to change that and *chose not to*, so they're equally culpable).

null,null,TrickyDickNixonbot,,People who disagree with me are war criminals,null,"&gt; I never said you were, but your attitude ends with us condoning things of that nature. Far from the ""hard left"" being the uncompromising ones, so called ""centrists"" find it impossible to enter a meaningful dialogue with those they deem politically incompatible with themselves. Look at the comments in this leadership race, rather than accepting disagreement half the party chastises Corbyn as a ""lefty loon"" who'll ""take us back to the 80s.""

This is an increasingly common form of political 'whataboutism' taking place lately. Where any criticism of Corbyn is deflected with ""LOOK HOW THE OTHER CANDIDATES TREAT HIM!"". I have been condemning on this subreddit and elsewhere the lack of proper debate (which only Burnham appears to actually be addressing) among the candidates, but the fact that the candidates are engaging in silly name calling does not render any and all criticism of Corbyn automatically a form of name-calling. You have just accused me of 'refusing to compromise' for disagreeing with him on foreign policy. Reflect on that for a second. Is it now 'name-calling' and 'refusing to compromise' to question anything Corbyn does?

&gt; You're far exaggerating his foreign policy positions, and actions

No im really not. All of the things I listed off he has actually done, and I will criticise him for them. Corbyn doesn't get a free pass on criticism simply because hes being treated 'unfairly' in the leadership race. 

&gt; and refusing to acknowledge that more so than Burnham or Cooper he's the one on the right side of history (see Iraq).

Stop using this 'right side of history' argument. On the contrary I think the entire anti-Iraq War movement is squarely on the wrong side of history, and the fact that its popular means nothing to me. A few decades down the line when the emotional ranting of pacifism loses its effect, the fact that pulling out of Iraq before we finished our work there created ISIS and destabilised the entire area will be blatant and widely accepted.

On the low end of the scale you have savings accounts, then fixed bonds (including those from Funding Circle ect) then at the higher end you could lend a property investor the money who could pay you a fixed return i.e. 8%+ (if you deal direct you won’t be stung with loads of random ‘transaction fee’s also).

To reduce the risk you could ask for a charge on the property which essentially means if it all goes tits up you still own the asset. However if whoever you are lending the money too intends to get a mortgage on that property, the mortgage lender will want the first charge so either you’ll either have to use the funds to cover refurb costs or partner with someone you can trust or go for lower value properties (I recently purchased a 3 bed terraced in Coventry for £75k). 

Head over to your local property networking meeting to get a better idea.

Hope that helps, easy to get overwhelmed!

I never had family killed by the IRA... but I was born and have lived in Belfast for over 30 years so i'll take a crack that for you.

You complain that Mr Corbyn somehow supports the IRA... why? because he engaged in dialogue with Sinn Fein before there was a Cease fire? A ceasefire that was only brought about I might add because people within the establishment DID speak to Sinn Fein behind the scenes and were able to get good faith negotiations off the ground. 

I hope you reserve some of your ire for John Major and Tony Blair who also had meetings with Sinn Fein before the Good Friday Agreement was signed.

If you just resent the fact that Jeremy supports the idea of Irish unification, may I remind you that currently Labour does not contest elections in Northern Ireland. That the party considers the SDLP to be thier 'sister party' and that working people should give them their votes... (The SDLP are not a unionist party). Interestingly, Jeremy is supportive of Labour actually running candidates here - one of the reasons i've since joined the party as an affliated member through my union.

lol, can't be seen to side with the pesky unionists on /r/northernireland! Your contributions here are completely one sided.

&gt;I support the renaming of Derry because it'd easier to say and every protestant or unionist I know bar one uses Derry too. If you remove either nationalist thinking the common sense option is Derry.

Seriously? Derry is a familiar shorthand. Have you asked whether they think their usage of Derry means it somehow invalidates the historic name of the city? That is not 'nationalist thinking'. It's simple fact. Unionists don't get all huffed up when nats use Derry in an official capacity, eg the council or airport. Why should nats try to whitewash history? What next, renaming the streets? 

&gt;They weren't very strong unionists in any case. 

What's the random barometer there? 'Not willing to have an insurrection'?

&gt;And are you seriously trying to paint the current government as anti-protestant for their education cuts?

It was Fianna Fail who implemented those cuts, FG just continued with them, after calling them out in Dublin for what they were. They are 100% anti-Protestant. The ugly ethnic nationalism stoked up in the media as a result was out of order but entirely predictable. Several schools are contemplating closure as a result. For the sake of a few million yoyos.

&gt;FG has a well known reputation for being the most protestant of the parties. There is at least one protestant minister, even if her performance is a bit shocking.

What does 'most protestant' mean? Neither FG nor FF are 'protestant' in the slightest save for token representation.

I remember your complaints of her too. The Protestant culture minister is 'shocking' because she's attempting to shoe horn a bit of reconciliation into 2016. Not that she's achieving that with tricolours in schools, more Irish language funding, national anthem focus, etc. But then you think she's too PC...

&gt;The military strategy for the Rising was based off that of the Paris Commune and Russian Revolution of 1905.

The Russian Revolution that happened across most parts of Russia? If they based it on that the insurrection in the GPO didn't come anywhere close to the 'plan'.

&gt;A damning report ranks Britain as 28th out of 30 for healthcare resources, with fewer doctors, nurses, beds and medical scanners than most wealthy countries

All this says the NHS is under funded and it says nothing about NHS efficiency, maybe the NHS is so efficient it does not need as many staff. Saying this report shows the NHS is rubbish is absolute nonsense. The Commonwealth Fund report in fact says the NHS is number one for efficiency.

The Telegraph spins these reports for their own purposes. It is clear the Tories have underfunded the NHS for 5 years and this has lead to increased waiting times and hospital increased debt. The other article you posted states waiting lists is one reason the NHS is low on that ranking system. The answer is to fund the NHS properly not change to an insurance based system. And look who funded this report FFS; 

&gt; The report was supported by two unrestricted grants. The first came from Medicover S.A in Belgium, a private health care organisation dealing in health insurance, prepaid health and medical services, occupational medicine and laboratory services. The other came from the New Direction Foundation in Belgium, which describes itself as a free market, European-realist think-tank affiliated to the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists.

According to whoscored when we used the 4231 and 433 formations (9 times each)

#Our most effective period was whilst playing 3-4-3


""Our starting XI's were mostly:

Mignolet - Manquillo, Skrtel, Lovren, Moreno - Henderson, Lucas - Lallana, Coutinho, Sterling - Lambert (had more appearances than Balo but overall fewer minutes)

Mignolet - Can, Skrtel, Lovren, Moreno - Henderson, Gerrard, Allen - Lallana, Lambert, Sterling.

If we go the 4231 route we will probably replace 4 or 5 players initially in Lambert, Manquillo, Sterling, Lucas and possibly Moreno.""

So we have replaced

#Maquillo - Clyne

#Moreno - Gomez

Both stronger defensively, Clyne has a full season alongside Lovren and Gomez already looks far more solid at defending our goal. We sent a young loanee back to Spain because he wasn't up to the task and replaced him with the England international right back. Our other young full back looks like he has serious competition from a kid who came in expecting to be loaned out again but instead has forced his way into contention based on his performances. Fight for the place or lose it to someone better.



#Sterling - Firmino

I'll take that. Sterling maybe quicker but I'm excited to see whether Firminho has more of a footballing brain. Judging by the number of assists and goals he's racked up, it's a fair bet to say his end product is streets ahead. He's also not going to have to be thrown in from gw1 and expected to be the saviour straight away.



#Sterling - Ibe. 

He doesn't need time to settle, knows about the pressure and pace and work rate required and has spent the summer working on his technique in front of goal. Again not expected to play every game as we have players who can interchange. 

#Gerrard - Milner

As amazing as he was for a decade, shoehorning Gerrard in for the past two seasons has been detrimental to the TEAM. I would have loved him to stay on in a coaching role but he chose the sunshine. Fair play to him, enjoy it, you've earned it. Saying that, with everything being demanded to go through him on the pitch every time it slowed play, allowed teams to recover and set against us and made our attacks start from between our centre backs. Milner will give just as much blood sweat and tears on the pitch but still has the engine to harry defenders on their box and then be back mopping up in front of our lads in defence a few seconds later. He's also the most experienced professional in our team now, and also about the most dedicated athlete playing football.  He's a great example to the younger guys, actually looks like he enjoys being on the pitch and knows what the biggest teams do to win ugly when needed. In 2015 Milner is a big upgrade on Gerrard just for the fact that he is droppable if the system or team requires it and will allow others to flourish too.


#Lambert - Ings

Lambert may be a life long red and much love to the guy but come on Ings has already scored more goals in a red shirt. He knows the Prem and has had a good pre season.

#Ballotelli - Benteke

We'll see won't we. I don't like the fee involved but I've come round to being quite excited at having Benteke lead our line. You can see why Ballotelli has only ever got 1 premier league assist. At least Benteke has proved he can do it in the Prem week in week out and is obviously a massive upgrade on Ballotelli! 
 



You talk like Can &amp; Lucas have left? Did I miss something overnight???

Overall,  the nucleus is still there, the spine is pretty much intact and we've upgraded every single position with more quality and or experience in the league. The one position where you could have a doubt is Gomez playing at LB. The only reason he may start there is because during preseason with the team he showed he is better there than what we had. Not based on scouting reports or Youtube,  it happened organically.  If it doesn't work, Moreno is still there to backup and Flanagan is closing in on a return. 

I'm more hopeful than I've been about us in ages right now. I love the depth, quality and mix of experience with the determination of youth all over the pitch. I love the competition for minutes and the fact we've added goals all over the pitch and added quality to our defense. If we'd bought unknowns kids from across the continent I might have more fears about gelling together but we haven't,  we've bought wisely to fill the gaps with known quality's that compliment what we already have. It may not be a championship winning team this year but this could be the foundations for a seriously fun ride for the next 4 or 5 years!

(To learn more, read Benefit From Borrowed Securities.)

By all means correct me if you think I'm wrong, but from my own experience and the above, short selling your own stock is a meaningless concept:

Selling stock you already own realises profits/losses accrued since purchase, partially or fully closing a position opened when you bought it in the first place.

The judgment essentially boils down to this:

The SoS was given a power to implement several copyright exceptions offered by EU law if he so wished. One of these was the Private Copying exception; you can make copies for your own private use, such as on iTunes. However, EU law required him to ensure there was ""full compensation"" to artists, if introducing the exception would cause non-negligible harm to the copyright holderrs. The SoS proceeded on the theory, which some reports advocate, that there was no harm by legalising it because the benefit making of private copies was already factored into the price of buying music, given how widely copying goes on and how known it is into the industry. The judge quashed this on the basis that the very empirical reports that the SoS relied on repeatedly claimed that their own data was confusing and inconclusive, and even points the other way.

So how could we get around this? Well, the statute says ""fair"" compensation, not ""full"" compensation - if the SoS had found some way to even partially compensate the music industry, even taken a rough stab, a judge would probably say ""given the lack of empirical evidence and the use of the word 'fair', this was within the genuine area of discretion of the SoS and is fine"". However, the SoS pretended to know there was no harm done, when he could not have done so.",null,0,null,1438942282,null,null,false,0,ctun31c,null,t3_3fzsg4,null,null,null,t3_3fzsg4,null,null,null,1440335453,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

&gt; Voters are allowed to be inconsistent, but parties cannot. Successful politics is as much about leading and forming public opinion as following it.

I thought that was an interesting point to bear in mind. Corbyn has already got discussion flowing and has more people thinking about socialist policies. Thousands of people have been going to his rallies and he's not even the leader. To assume he will have no positive impact on public opinion is ridiculous.

&gt;Which TWO of the following were the strongest reasons to vote LABOUR?

The top 4 (on the side of working people, improving the NHS, tackling inequality and being good for public services) all sound like what Corbyn is striving for.

&gt;Which TWO of the following most put you off voting LABOUR?

The top point - would spend too much / can't be trusted with the economy - This is affects all of Labour, not just Corbyn, and is the unfortunate result of being in power during a global recession. Labour in general needs to remind everyone about that. 

2nd point - would be bossed around by the SNP - Well a Labour under Corbyn would have more similarities with SNP than the Tories. But I've no idea how that would work out. Again this is more about changing public perception of left wing policies, which I hope/think will have made great strides by 2020.

3rd - make it too easy for people to live on benefits - He certainly would. Again this is a perception issue. Once more people realise that the impact of ""benefits scroungers"" is miniscule compared to that of corporate tax avoidance fewer will see this as an issue.

4th - They would raise taxes - Can't argue with that, because he would. But at least the main focus would be on the richest getting fairly taxed, rather than a huge tax rise for everyone.

&gt;Labour is too SOFT on big business and the banks.
&gt;Labour should increase taxes on the rich.

More people agree with the above than their respective opposite statements. So that's another positive for Corbyn.

&gt;Labour should be more Left/Right wing

Very slightly more said right wing despite all of the above saying otherwise. Looks like the usual thing of people having an aversion to anything branded as ""loony left"" by the biased right wing media. That's more speculation than anything, but once again I think once the left wing has had more time in the limelight for the next few years, public opinion on this is bound to change.

&gt; Labour should be tougher on those abusing the welfare system

A large amount agree with that statement. As I mentioned above, public opinion needs to improve. ""Benefits scroungers"" have been vilified by the rich as a smokescreen to the real scroungers - the multinational tax-avoiders. Reminds me of a joke I heard recently: *'A banker, a worker and a man on benefits are sat a table with 20 cookies on it. The banker takes 19 and says to the worker ""watch out for him; he's going to take your cookie""'*

&gt; Labour should be TOUGHER on immigration

More agreed with this statement. Again hopefully JC can shift public perception after the fear-mongering and vilification from the right-wing and UKIP. JC is very much pro immigration.

&gt;the Conservatives won despite never persuading people that the NHS was safe in their hands – an issue important for many voters.

Just showing that some big issues don't make or break an election result.

&gt;Which party do you feel more confident to deal with the issue of the economy overall

Way more said Tory. Again this is the fallout of being in power during the recession and affects all of Labour, not Corbyn specifically.

Main take away from the article: 

&gt;Labour’s fundamental problem appears to be a failure to present itself as competent to run the economy

I've already made points about this above.

So overall that first link is not evidence of JC's ""unelectability"" at all. The main issues are with the perception of the Labour party in general or perceptions of benefits and immigration issues which can be improved with a strong socialist voice.

Apologies for the essay. I was going to look through each link but I've spent far too much time just looking at that first one. So there may well be some damning evidence in there; but not really if that first link is anything to go by.

I wasn't thinking of any in particular. I was making a point that saying x y z economists agree isn't really conclusive. I realise this isn't a substantive economic argument, but that doesn't make it any less true: you can find a substantive economic argument without much difficulty. 

&gt; I disagree that there is an equivalence here... A central investment bank comes with its own problems granted, but I don't see how they are comparable. I think a lot of the causes are well understood.

A bank is bank, regardless of who runs it. Regulation was *a* cause, but it wasn't *the* cause. People, on all sides of the issue, (including customers) were the cause. 

In retrospect the causes are understood. But at the time everything is booming and looking good. That's how bubbles work. 

&gt; 'small-state' free market kind of guy

Pretty much guilty. I'm not adverse to intervention though, and am not fanatically anti-government -- there are important roles for government in addition to the basics of welfare, education and so on, but I also believe they need to be assessed and adapted on a case by case basis where possible. It really depends who is running the show. 

&gt; Just because we don't know everything what will happen due to a given policy doesn't mean we should do nothing.

I haven't met anyone who suggests do nothing, and I don't know where I made this claim myself either. But now that you mention it, Chris Dillow linked to this [interesting study](https://ideas.repec.org/p/rut/rutres/200213.html) from his blog. That's still not an argument to do nothing though. 

But I think you're right generally speaking in your last two paragraphs. However, my concern with *more* stimulus is to do with the precedent it will set and continue to set. People get carried away, and it can just as easily take us back into a boom, to be followed by another bust. 

There's also the general point that there is no way to say that those running this project will be better placed at deciding where to direct the investment. And for all the good it could do, it could just as easily distort things. I think the system needs some breathing room from all this political hustle and tussle. Rules need to be stable for market actors to plan and have confidence in what they are doing. They can't do this if every so often interventions occur.

tl;dr:

* Setting up a Defence Diversification Agency, which will be a joint project between current Trident workers, government and industry to try and diversify existing jobs that depend on Trident (specifically aiming towards directing energies towards high-tech goals, in line with similar moves made in the US after the US stepped down from its Cold War level Nuclear industry)

* Ultimately beginning the societal transition to a post-nuclear society so that by the time 2062 comes, it won't cost jobs, money and security to scrap Trident.

There is no immediate scrapping or selling of Trident, it's just setting the course of mitigating the economic cost of not renewing it and reducing our dependency on it.

(Of course to be balanced, this plan is pointless as even if Labour is elected in 2020, this plan would have to assume that a) Labour or some party supporting nuclear disarmament remains in power for 42 years, and that b) Labour or said party won't change course at some point in those 42 years...)",null,0,null,1438942361,null,null,1438942650,0,ctun3qs,null,t3_3g1398,null,null,null,t1_ctumxnm,null,null,null,1440335462,null,2,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

Also, every investor has rules - some ""ethical funds"" might not invest in military companies - BAE and the like. Other funds might only invest in ""clean"" energy companies if they're buying into that sector.

What is pretty common is to avoid any company where a single shareholder has a controlling interest (i.e. all the others are just along for the ride, their votes don't mean anything). RBS is not just controlled by a single shareholder, but that shareholder is a government. Many of the big investment companies are absolutely not interested in government-owned companies, and this depresses the share price as much as the actual state of the business.

By shuffling off shares a few at a time, the government nudges past people's investment limits. By the time they get their holding down to 50% all the really big players will be taking an interest, and increased demand equals higher prices. The price has already gone from 330p to 348p, which will benefit the next block of shares they sell. Effectively the government has to play this little-by-little game, because if it just sat on 78%, it would *never* get to a point where they can flog their entire holding for 501p (and if they did dump all 78% on the market in one go, that would push down the price due to oversupply, so they need to drip-feed shares out).

Also, RBS won't get back to 501p because it's a much smaller business now - business divisions have been spun off separately, and 600 branches will be spun out as a new bank ""Williams &amp; Glyn"" next year due to EU competition laws. The shareholders will get income from selling shares in that new business, which sits additional to the actual RBS shares, so simply saying ""501-330 = 171p loss"" is not representative of the situation, because RBS isn't a single, monolithic entity any more.",null,0,null,1438942428,null,null,false,0,ctun4b1,null,t3_3fqzp4,null,null,null,t3_3fqzp4,null,null,null,1440335469,null,1,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

null,null,ggow,null,null,null,"Well it makes sense that as a commenter you'd engage in similar practices as the articles you're linking, which is to say, using top-level figures to try and back up a point whilst completing ignoring the underlying nuance. It's getting a bad response because it's a bad article. 

Take for example the healthcare section, or even just the spending section. 

&gt;One might expect the Scottish government to reduce the extra amount it spends on core public services if Scotland’s health service, education system and police force were noticeably better than those in England. But there is little evidence that this is the case.

The first thing to note is that the figures it's quoting run from years 98/99-13/14. Over half that period of time, the SNP were not the government running Holyrood. It doesn't make much sense to use such low-resolution data to criticise a government because you can't see trends, when those trends began, or really anything especially useful. 

The next question to consider is whether the premise even makes sense? The question the SNP government ought to be asking is 'How much spending does the Scottish NHS/Police Scotland need?' Not, 'Should we maintain the spending gap with the English NHS?'. The government of England was playing catch up in health expenditure for most of the last decade, wheras the S-NHS was already better funded. If the S-NHS were experiencing real-terms budget increases, which it was, then does it matter if the gaps closing? You really need to look at more information for that. 

The other other thing to discuss is the low quality understanding of the Barnett formula on show. Even if ever consequential accruing from healthcare spending in E/E&amp;W were directed towards healthcare in Scotland, which is to say the same priorities were pursued, without real cuts elsewhere in the budget, the ScotGov simply couldn't have maintained the spending gap a that 16.+%. Consequentials are worked out on a per-capita basis, and give equal per-capita grants for each increase to the budget (i.e. it is a mathematical property of the formula that spending levels will converge).  A £10pc increment in England is a larger portion of the budget than a £10pc increment in Scotland. The budgets would converge and the 'extra gap' that 'one might assume would be maintained' would shrink. All of which is to say, it's a bullshit metric to be looking at. 

And all of the above misses a crucial point: it's explicit SNP policy, as campaigned on, to chuck every spare penny at infrastructure. At the last Holyrood election their promise was to maintain expenditure on healthcare (as defined by a particular line item whose actual name I won't dredge up) at a certain level. They did that. A lot of the rest of their manifesto was based on how they'd go about getting savings in certain areas and how they'd go about investing in infrastructure and promoting economic growth. Can you really say a party isn't a 'party of government' for sticking to explicit manifesto commitments? I'm not sure you can. 

And don't even get me started on the brain-dead approach that author has taken to the council tax freeze. Councils don't need to sign up to the council-tax freeze. Councils have control over other taxes, and they have used that control. The bulk of the strain on local authorities stem not from a council tax freeze but from the block grants being shrunk, (as a consequence of the Scottish Government block grant being shrunk). (All of this is to say nothing of the fact that the council tax freeze is a stop gap until a better local tax can be implemented, with the first proposal being shot down in Whitehall)

In terms of 'centralisation', the SNP passed the greatest act of local devolution in the local authorities history when they changed the funding mechanism for those local authorities. In the past, councils had to contend with a fixed budget for a fixed service area. That ring-fencing was abolished and what now happens is that targets and outcomes are agreed upon and a budget is made available for those councils to go about implementing as they see fit. In terms of Police Scotland, the local authorities have a greater statutory role in local running of the service. 

On the subject of Police Scotland *(off topic, I know people consider X Scotland to be an annoying naming convention, but it is common outside of Scotland too e.g. Elections Canada, Health Canada, etc. and is not some conspiracy to push Scotland down everyone's throat)*, the 'Strathclydisation' is over blown, especially the hysteria about the armed police. An operational decision was made to better utilise the small portion of Scotland's armed police by having them respond to normal incidents. It was not a decision made by the SNP administration and they had the decision reversed. Scotland did not have routinely armed police as standard, but more as something like 1% of the officers on duty. In terms of the stop and search, might we not consider it being taken under review and stopped as a benefit of Police Scotland. Strathclyde apparently was enduring this for years, and it was treading close to the Human Rights line. By having it exposed on the Scotland-wide scale, we're seeing movement on it being fixed. The size of PS allows it to be properly monitored by the press and the public, wheras before the small forces were just slipping under the radar i.e. bigger organisations can more easily be held to higher standards by our civil society.

I could go on but it's a overly one-sided article, lacking in nuance, and just dinging unflattering statistics off of the SNP's face without any considering for whether it's policy, whether it's really a bad thing, whether there are underlying factors, or whether there's substantially more to it than the general public understand. 

TL;DR The article is pisspoor but has a facade of credibility. It's playing well here because it plays up to the biases of /r/unitedkingdom and, with the best will in the world, the average subscriber here is less able to pick through the nonsense than the average user in /r/scotland. (Not because /r/scotland is any more intelligent but because it's a more localised subreddit where the people have followed all the stats as they were released and developed, as opposed to many here coming across them for the first time). With that in mind, it's getting a hostile reading there because it deserves it and they know it deserves it.

I side with people here when I agree with them. That usually means they are saying something socialist or near enough. Unionists here generally tend to be right wing in most of their views here. That's why I don't jump on their side all the time. Not because we're all secret nationalists ganging up on you poor little things.

You're blind if you think your reasoning is anything other than British nationalism. Most young protestants I know don't give two shits what it's called. They call it Derry. They don't give a shit about the history of the name. 

It's very simple. Almost no one outside of a minority uses the full name unless they have to. A most of the residents use the short name. Most people want to change it to just the short name to put an end to it. It will happen eventually. People will move on like nothing happened. To get worked up about it stems directly from nationalist sentiment. Those pushing strongly for it also do so from nationalist sentiment but those who don't care about either are happy to let it happen. Get out of your black and white world.

The Dublin workers weren't strong enough unionists because they made no impact on the history of the city worth mentioning. If they were strongly unionist there would have been significant conflict in the city over it.

As I said FG is considered the most protestant of all the parties. They disproportionately get the protestant vote and have more protestant members than the others. It goes back to when southern unionists started voting for Cumann na nGaedheal after independence.

My gripe with her is mainly the farcical nepotism she got herself involved in with regard to the art museum boards. And I don't like putting flags up at every school either. Nationalism should be kept out of the classroom.

Fine Gael however have been watering down the Rising to whitewash history, something you have strong feelings about. There were more references to Facebook than the actual rising in their launch video.

The 1905 revolution involved street fighting in Petrograd. Hence the strategic influence. 

And they were soviet in name only. Irish soviets were nothing like Russian ones with the exception of Limerick. Most people had just heard the word and tried to emulate what happened with little understanding of what actually did happen. But it shows the international inspiration some had.

I'm not replying again to your nonsense. This is two days you've kept this up. Some of us have better things to be at than playing the victim with history. Get over yourself.

I would actually chalk that one up more to the fact that Iain Duncan Smith is a complete moron who couldn't even lead a dog on a leash.

EDIT: I mean to quote the Wiki article on the subject:

&gt;Duncan Smith proved not to be a particularly effective public speaker in the rowdy atmosphere of Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) in the House of Commons. His seeming troubles with a ""frog in his throat"" throughout most of his two years as leader prompted Private Eye to refer to him incessantly as ""Iain Duncan Cough"". As well as this, there were continued rumours of discontent among his backbenchers, not dampened by his warning to his party in November 2002: ""My message is simple and stark, unite or die"".

&gt;The 2002 Conservative Party conference saw an attempt to turn Duncan Smith's lack of charisma into a positive attribute, with his much-quoted line, ""do not underestimate the determination of a quiet man"". The line was as much derided as it was admired. During PMQs, Labour backbenchers would raise their fingers to their lips and say ""shush"" when he was speaking. The following year, Duncan Smith's conference speech appeared to have abandoned this technique in favour of an aggressive hard-man approach that few found convincing, even if the party members in the hall punctuated the speech with several ovations. The most remembered sound bite from the speech was his, ""the quiet man is here to stay, and he's turning up the volume.""",null,0,null,1438942792,null,null,1438943189,0,ctun7m4,null,t3_3g0kn6,null,null,null,t1_cttxg5i,null,null,null,1440335513,null,2,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

'Only two countries in the world base their immigration and emigration estimates entirely on counting. One is Australia, which is a good example. A less encouraging example is North Korea. However, every other country in the world bases its migration flow estimates on samples, measuring and estimating or a population register. Germany, for example, keeps an up-to-date population register—the equivalent of a census kept constantly up to date—to monitor its migration flows.

We are in a no man’s land at the moment. We neither count effectively nor sample effectively, and even though we have the decennial census, which has provided the correction of 346,000, that does not resolve the problem between censuses. The underestimation of net migration was identified only by the census on a 10-yearly basis, so the ONS is unable to revise its annual estimates of immigration and emigration as components of migration during the same period, even though it knows that they must be wrong. As a result, for the years from 2001 to 2011, our best estimate of net migration each year is not equal to our best estimate of immigration minus our best estimate of emigration. We are into an Alice in Wonderland world of numbers in which we know that our official figures for each year are wrong, but they cannot be changed, as we have no other sources to use.'

Rangers fans aren't getting butthurt because the BBC reported fans were arrested for sectarian singing and throwing flares. In fact, I would expect this stuff to be reported.



However, I would also expect this stuff to be reported in a similar manner for every other club.  Amplifying the headlines just when it comes to Rangers leads to people like yourself thinking that this is something that happens at every game.

When BBC reporter Chris McLaughlin reported these arrests on his twitter account, he also made the claim [""I always ask delegate after games if any problems. I would have reported exactly the same way if it was any other club.""](https://twitter.com/BBCchrismclaug/status/625005100520591360). 

If that was true I would actually be very happy. However, some determined Rangers fans have actually looked at his reporting during previous matches where he was on reporting duty and found that:

* He has been on reporting duty at other matches, not involving Rangers, where there were arrests in similar circumstances but did not report on them and the arrests weren't headline news.
* Despite this first point, the only time he has actually commented on arrests at a football match were other Rangers games.

It's the inconsistency with the reporting these events that is the problem here.",null,0,null,1438943249,null,null,1438944904,0,ctunbmr,null,t3_3g1951,null,null,null,t1_ctu9pmz,null,null,null,1440335565,null,11,null,ScottishFootball,t5_2sba4,11,null

The Guardian's story is all about how Britons outnumber EU nationals claiming unemployment benefits in *some* countries, and about a nuanced picture, they do not claim that the sum of British nationals claiming in the EU outnumbers the EU nationals claiming in the UK. Which you can see from the data is not the case - the 30,000 UK nationals claiming in the rest of the EU are outnumbered by the UK-based claimants from just the top four countries - Poland, Slovakia, Portugal and Czech Republic.

http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/19/-sp-thousands-britons-claim-benefits-eu

&gt;Hi *HawkUK*,

&gt;Thank you for applying to become a Supporter of the Labour Party recently. 

&gt;To complete your application we do need to make sure you are on the Electoral Register first. Unfortunately we were not able to match you based on the details provided. 

&gt;You may not have been matched because… 

&gt;When we cannot match details supplied against the electoral register, it’s usually for one of the three reasons below, which should be easy to resolve. 

&gt; 1. If you are unsure whether you are on the electoral register, apply by going to https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote. You will receive a confirmation email and you should forward this to us at this address as evidence of your application.

&gt; 2. It’s possible that you may have submitted details to us that differ slightly from how you appear on the electoral register. If you think this is the case, you should resubmit your application at http://support.labour.org.uk/

&gt; 3. Sometimes our records aren’t up-to-date with local council records. So it you have any proof that you are on the electoral register (e.g. an email from your council confirming you are on the register, or an image of a recent polling card) you can email this to us at this address.

&gt;If you have any other query about whether you are on the electoral register, please let us know by replying to this email and we will do our best to help. 

&gt;Kind regards, 

&gt;The Labour Party",null,0,null,1438944973,null,null,false,0,ctunrd0,null,t3_3g3w9g,null,null,null,t3_3g3w9g,null,null,null,1440335771,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,null,Taure,eng-Suffolk,Suffolk County,null,"This quote is just the opinion of the IPO. It's not the actual court decision.

The ruling itself doesn't actually relate at all to the legality of making copies but rather to an EU law about compensation. The EU law states that where harm has been done to a copyright holder, they're entitled to compensation, unless the harm was minimal/negligible. The UK government attempted to carve out an exception to this compensation rule, saying that copying for personal use was essentially always minimal harm.

It was this exception the court struck down, as it left copyright holders to exposed to potential harm without compensation, in contradiction of EU law. Further, the original basis of the decision was that the definition of ""harm"" had not been fully considered by the Secretary of State making the regulations. Once the Secretary of State pins down the concept to a suitable level, the regulations can return to force, provided that they protect said copyright holders from harm.

The reporting is correct in that it does still ban copying of files, but compensation is still only payable if greater than de minimis harm is suffered by the copyright holder. That's not going to be the case in cases of regular backing up of files. If you do get sued for backing up your files, damages would be nominal (i.e. £1).

And of course, because the basis of this is EU law, it applies across the whole of the EU, not just the UK.

Good article on the decision:

null,null,atheistmil,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"WHEN the Bank of England last raised interest rates, most people had never heard of subprime mortgages; the Chinese economy was half its current size; and the iPhone was only a month old. Since July 2007 the only changes to the base rate of interest have been downward, and since March 2009 the bank has made no adjustments at all, keeping rates at 0.5% for 77 consecutive months, the longest period of stasis since the second world war (though things were even quieter in the 18th century—see chart 1). On August 6th the bank’s monetary-policy committee (MPC) voted to hold rates steady again. But with more of its members striking a hawkish tone, many pundits expect an increase by the turn of the year. What will it mean when rates rise at last?

It strikes many as odd that rates rises are on the cards. Inflation is stuck at zero, far below the bank’s target of 2%. Wages are growing faster than at any time since 2010, but it is far from certain that such increases will continue. And when central banks have raised rates too early—as the European Central Bank did in 2011—they have done such harm that they have been forced to reverse course. Nonetheless, hawkish members of the MPC argue that unless rates rise soon, inflation will break through the 2% target before long.

Among those who are nervous about higher rates are mortgage-holders. According to the European Mortgage Federation, an industry body, in 2013 Britain had residential-mortgage debt worth 81% of GDP, the joint-third-highest in Europe. Worse, more than half of outstanding mortgages in Britain are variable-rate, meaning that they follow the Bank of England’s interest rate. If that were to rise by two percentage points, someone with a 75% mortgage on a house worth £400,000 ($625,000)—the average price of a pad in London—would see their annual repayments increase by £4,000, equivalent to 6% of the pay of the median mortgage-holder in the capital.

But higher repayments will not necessarily lead to a wave of defaults. Standard &amp; Poor’s, a rating agency, points out that mortgage-interest payments as a percentage of income are at their lowest since records began, at 10.6%. Across the country only about 4% of mortgage-holders are really vulnerable, with their total mortgage repayments exceeding 40% of their gross income. As house prices have soared, a Bank of England report suggests, those borrowers who would otherwise have taken on the most debt have decided to rent instead. At the same time, stricter rules that came into force last year have curbed excessive lending.

Things will not get much worse for some time. Rates are unlikely to rise steeply, given the fragility of the world economy. And the government’s fiscal austerity programme will encourage the bank to keep rates low, lest demand fall too far. Mark Carney, the bank’s governor, reckons the base rate will settle at a level “about half as high as historical averages”, or about 2%. Add to that Britain’s shortage of homes, and the housing market does not look vulnerable. Standard &amp; Poor’s predicts that house prices will rise by 5% next year and by 2.5% in 2017.

Higher interest rates will affect different households in different ways. Total personal debt remains higher than the stock of savings (see chart 2). So, overall, higher debt-servicing costs will outweigh the extra money that savers will reap. Worse, wealthy people—ie, those with plenty of savings—have a low marginal propensity to consume, meaning that they spend little of any extra income they receive. All this crimps consumption on two fronts, pulling down overall demand. But in Britain the effect may be muted. To understand why, consider demography.

Age shall not weary them

In demographic terms, Britain is one of the most unequal countries in the rich world. The wealth of the average 55- to 64-year-old household head in Britain is over five times that of the average 16- to 34-year-old; in Italy the oldies are only three times as rich as the young. On the other side of the balance-sheet, the household debt of British twenty-somethings is about five times that of those in their 50s and 60s. Broadly speaking, old people will gain from interest-rate rises since they are net savers, whereas young people will lose out because they are net borrowers.

Wonks reckon that the elderly have a high marginal propensity to consume: they blow extra money on cruises rather than putting it in the bank. The young are more likely to stash away extra cash for the future. Since the gains from higher interest rates will flow disproportionately to oldies, who have the most savings, they are more likely to be spent. Though analysis by the Bank of England suggests that this effect will be small, it may mean that higher rates will not crimp consumption as much as they would in other rich countries.

The end of ultra-low interest rates may bode ill for the productivity of British businesses, which is already poor. Output per hour is still lower than before the crisis of 2007, whereas in America and even France it has grown. Tight monetary policy should be bad for productivity, since it makes business investment more expensive. As the cost to businesses of borrowing has fallen by more than half since 2008, investment by firms has risen by 20%. The worry now is that dearer borrowing will curb the investment binge, making productivity even more dismal.

Yet there is another side to the productivity equation. Kristin Forbes, a member of the MPC, points out that, as in Japan in the 1990s, cheap borrowing may allow inefficient “zombie firms” to survive for longer than they normally would. In Britain interest payments as a share of profits have fallen from about 25% in 2009 to 10% today, bringing down company liquidations with them. As they stagger on, zombie firms hold down average productivity levels in their industry and, as a result, put a lid on wage growth. Rising interest rates could slowly start to sort the wheat from the chaff.

Especially if the Bank of England tightens the monetary screws faster than America’s Federal Reserve, the pound may appreciate rapidly, making firms’ exports more expensive. This, too, will help to zap the zombies, but all exporters will suffer. And the rises in productivity as the inefficient firms go under will come at the expense of higher unemployment in the short term. The end of cheap money is a worry for households and businesses. But as rates move upwards, there will be some upsides too.",null,0,null,1438945372,null,null,false,0,ctunv0t,null,t3_3g4834,null,null,null,t3_3g4834,null,null,null,1440335819,null,5,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

null,null,cbfw86,,Corbyn for Leader of the Opposition,null,"&gt;The last two points are a bit of a red herring, actually, because – it isn't only the tube drivers who are actually striking. Every grade of tube staff voted for industrial action. Their concern is that, by adding to the hours in which the tube is open without significantly increasing staff numbers – by introducing the Night Tube on the cheap – the existing staff will be over-stretched and passenger safety could end up compromised.

&gt;Today's strike isn't about that £50k pay packet at all.

&gt;All that said, it's about time the tube did offer all night services, and TfL would be negligent if it wasn't trying to make it happen as cost effectively as possible. I'm not saying that the unions are entirely in the right, and management entirely in the wrong on this one. I don't actually think I know.

&gt;But my point is – neither do you.

Ok so after wasting my time with that entire article with all manner of idealistic brainfarts on the morality of industrial action, the author then says that I'm ignorant and so don't have the right to be pissed off that I lost two hours of work time yesterday and had to make it up in the evening, thereby missing the fast trains and getting home at 9.20pm?

Is this author for real? I should probably stop whining that my convenience, which I pay for, is being used as leverage by someone else to get their way? And people are giving this article the time of day?

What I'm arguing is while this is definitely true for children as they are more impressionable it is not the comedian's fault that children are able to view his material. 

We have age restrictions for a reason. If parents are ignoring the restrictions or are not diligent enough in their policing of what their children have access to online then that is a failing of the parent. You can't cry ""won't somebody think of the children"" like Helen fucking Lovejoy when the comedian and their production company HAS been thinking of the children and have put the proper restrictions in place.

They can't be expected to take the blame for shitty parents.

The common law is clear that no matter what a contract says the landlord can't charge you for things like cleaning etc unless it is actually needed. The only reaonable charge that I could potentially see arising that is at least arguable is the cost of the check-out inspection.

There are some regulations about being upfront about check in/out fees, but you may wish to see how new they are (your contract is quite old). 

Re the notice point, it depends on if the original tenancy says it will become periodic. If so, you could be on a *contractual periodic tenancy* its terms may well continue to apply. If not, you could be on a *statutory periodic tenancy* and the law applies - but this is not a simple as just one months' notice. It is one month *ending on a rental period*. So if rent is due, say, 5th of month and you serve notice on 1st January the tenancy ends on the 4th of Feb. If you serve on the 10th January the tenancy ends on 4th March.

I bring this up because I actually just noticed your comment in another thread where you joke about Australian cricket fans being depressed. Depression is a pretty debilitating condition, so why is it okay to joke about depression, but not downs syndrome? It's a bit of a double standard.

Don't forget, disabled and ill people are still human, just because they have a disability or illness, doesn't mean they can't have a sense of humour. I have a condition which Frankie Boyle makes ""horrible"" jokes about from time to time (and which causes the newspapers to overreact in this way when he does), and I think it's funny when he jokes about it, because he's a comedian, and he doesn't mean a word of it.

He then tried to enforce discipline (with the notorious party conference where he had supporters around the room orchestrating standing ovations for him to simulate support - they managed *seventeen* standing ovations).

See [this article](http://www.contractorumbrella.com/ir35_and_six_figure_tax_bill.html) for a rather more extreme example.

Could you perhaps negotiate for with your current employer to be paid slightly less to take care of the extra tax burden they would face if they were to employ you legitimately? You are already more than willing to pay the tax yourself for the employee taxes. If you perhaps mention that the DWP was asking questions about income it might be enough to spur them into action (or they might just stop 'employing' so use your judgement).

If the choice was between reporting your employer (but giving up the income you desperately need) and continuing to work illegally (due to cash in hand tax evasion) then contracting would be the grey bit in the middle. Legitimacy is the best option whether this is getting yourself on payroll or just reporting them but it's still a difficult choice to make.

null,null,aenor,null,null,null,"&gt;Under a democratic system it'll all be down to the strength of the left at conference, and the conversion of the groundswell of opinion to actual power within the party.

That can only work if ""the strength of the left"" deselects the MPs to get people of a more extreme left instead.

The MPs will retaliate by calling by-elections. ""Well voters, who do you want as your MP, myself, a moderate chappy. Or that looney lefty Corbynite who is subject to purges from his followers if he doesn't toe their extremist line"". Voters will go for the moderate of course - *they always do*.

I expect at the end of it there will be two parties - The Independent Labour Party of about 188 MPs and the Corbyn Labour party of 48 MPs. Corbyn won't be the leader of the opposition - his party will be too small. 

The extreme left can pick all the people they want at their conference - *the voters won't elect them* - TUSC got a grand total of 100,000 votes out of 30,000,000 cast in the 2015 general election.
