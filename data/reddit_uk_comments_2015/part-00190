null,false,severedfragile,lfc68,,null,"Ugh. Come on. Coutinho's major task this season was to show he can run a game consistently, and he's done that really, really well in the second half of the season. It's gotten to the point you reliably know what you can get from Coutinho, and that can't be reflected in stats. Lallana's the opposite, even in a single game you can't tell how his next 10 minutes are going to go. If you want a player comparison to Coutinho, he's stylistically pretty similar to Iniesta (again, *stylistically* rather than in terms of quality - because I know some fuckhead/manc is going to ignore this entire post to make some ""LOL are you comparing Coutinho and Iniesta deluded!!"" comment) and his performances can be absolutely magnificent without anything tangible to put on paper.

In terms of qualities, Lallana is the better presser, is two-footed and finishes better. Coutinho has better vision, intelligence close-control,  passing, through-balls, crosses, ball-retention and shots from range. They're probably similarly good dribblers, though Coutinho probably uses his better. They're both good at winning  the ball although Phil's more aggressive. Coutinho is much more influential. That's anecdotal.

 When stats are surprising, it's either because we're all missing something or because the stats are missing something, and they both play in roles full of intangibles. Someone on r/soccer posted stats comparing Coutinho and Siggurdson a while ago, and as someone who's watched pretty much every minute of both players this season, the stats are misleading because Coutinho's had a much better season than Siggy.

Historically, Dortmund pays the 4th-5th highest wages in Bundesliga. Their budget used to be about €40m per season which placed them practically in a 3 way tie for fifth.

For example, in 2011-12 (one of Klopps title winning seasons), they spent Just over €40m. Bayern spent €100m, Schalke spent €60m, Stuttgart spent €50m, Wolfsburg spent €50m and Leverkuesen spent €40m

[Source](http://abehnisch.com/bundesliga-wage-efficiency/)

I don't know if squad size affects the number on a per player basis (like the sporting intelligence report shows), but I do know that Dortmund have a strict wage structure that has them nowhere near the highest wages in Germany.

My entire point is that Dortmund, under Klopp, are not free spending, compete with several clubs that usually spend more than them every year and are somehow still ranked 12th in the UEFA club rankings with 2 Bundesliga titles.

This ignores the obvious question of the land routes through Abkhazia and Pankisi or from the Black Sea.

So Putin and Medvedev found themselves in a situation where Russian peacekeepers are, thousands of women and children crying on TV asking where the Russian army was, hundreds of thousands of Abkhazians wondering if Russia would protect them and thousands of Russian men arming themselves to fight.

Narratives exist because stories are how people make sense of the world.  The use of symbols and myths in order to generate response. especially when it comes to creating the environment for action. 

These also create norms and ideas on which social exchange is based (Weber, 1974; Bourdieu , 1986). This is how we also create of social reality (Burger &amp; Luckman, 1964) 

This is why racism and antisemitism is not ""just being nasty to Jews""  , it is systematized, structured and deeply rooted in the fabric of society. Here's an early example with the Rothschilds:

&gt;""Every aspect of Dairnvaell's tale – the ruthlessness, the guile, the greed – represents a derogatory racial stereotype, and he was writing at a moment when such attitudes were having one of their periodic surges of popularity in Europe.

&gt;The story was also false: Nathan Rothschild was not at Waterloo or even in Belgium at the time. There was no Channel storm. And he made no great killing on the stock market.

&gt;Yet the Satan pamphlet, translated into many languages and reprinted many times, gave this legend such a grip on history that, albeit often in modified or diluted forms, references to it can still be found today both in popular culture and in scholarly works.""


http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-rothschild-libel-why-has-it-taken-200-years-for-an-antisemitic-slur-that-emerged-from-the-battle-of-waterloo-to-be-dismissed-10216101.html

By the way this myth ends up on the Reddit front page every 6 months or so. 

What's important to note here is this : the myth works of an extant social reality - the Rothschilds were very successful , the achieved their in the nascent banking sector and did very well. 

Where does it go from there? It then adds the antisemitic tropes and values of the age. It makes the Rothschild fit the racial stereotypes that existed and makes them out to be privater ne'er do-wells who capitalised on the death of others and used deep cunning to profit from the war.  It fits up Rothschild as the Shylock of his day.

But this narrative took off. to this day we are still lumbered with the myth that Rothschild got in on the act and became even more fabulously wealthy on the misfortune/fortune of others.

The extant narrative was that Jews were conniving, the Rothschild story fed on it, then enhanced it. It fed back into the anti-semitism of powerful Jewish bankers that the far right still hold dear. It also fed into the ""stab in the back"" myth that the German's were given to chew on in the 1930s. 

But someone like you would be going ""But the Rothschilds DID make money off the Napoleonic Wars"", yet the non Jewish bankers around the time made even more money, Rothschild probably did worse than his contemporary class. 

So why this story? Why this narrative? 

The same question can be asked about every single item you attribute to Muslims ? Why those stories , when there are examples of non-muslims doing those things too?

They follow them selectively, according to the political mood of the time. There are plenty of cases where Christian preachers have used the old testament to justify religious persecution, gay bashing or war.

&gt; the book of Hebrews explains why the ""Old Covenant"" (essentially the OT rules) are no longer in force

My understanding, albeit as a non-Christian, is that the Bible is quite unclear on the matter, and definitely open to interpretation. There are passages which support both views. For example, Matthew 5:17-19

&gt; “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18 For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 19 Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

Probably because no one is attempting to integrate the Beth Din into the legitimate legal system. Beth Din is basically in the same legal wheelhouse as authorized mediation, it has no statutory authority. Same as Sharia currently. But unlike Sharia i have never EVER heard a Jew argue that Beth Din should become binding English Law. I've heard MANY Muslims argue that Sharia should. That's the principle difference that tends to rile people.

For a different perspective, I live in Rome and until I moved here I never realised how good our train service actually is in comparison. 

I mean, the UK can still be shit, and if you're relying on it to get to work regularly I can see how it would drive you nuts - but it was a wake-up call to see how shit things *could* be when I moved here. Read and weep:

Where I was living until I moved because I could stand it no longer, the commuter train officially ran into the city every half an hour or so, but only until 10pm. At least that was the official schedule for the arrival of the filthy carriages covered in graffiti with no air conditioning in 38C weather. What actually happens is they publish a season timetable (albeit they don't actually bother putting copies up in the stations), then the day the timetable is launched half the trains are labelled ""corse soppresse"" (cancelled runs) - but this is only shown on the LED display in the main terminus. If you're in any of the other stations you only find out when your train doesn't come. 

And even the ones that haven't been cancelled are late. And every few weeks the train company realises it fucked up the timetable and publishes a new timetable - again not putting copies up in the stations. And then there were line works which meant there was only one line for about a kilometre of track, which also gave the train a 5 degree tilt as it went through and all the other trains had to sit there waiting their turn.

There are no ticket offices at all, only ticket machines, which are often broken, which don't take cards and don't dispense more than 6 euros in change. If the machine is broken and there's a tobacconist nearby that is open you can buy a ticket there - provided it's not lunchtime and that they haven't run out.

It apparently takes three people to drive each train - there's always three in each cab - but they have at least one strike a month. Only ever on a Friday of course. 

None of this excuses the UK's service of course, but believe me it could be so, so much worse.",null,0,null,1432147875,null,0,false,0,crfhwh6,null,t3_36lziu,null,t1_crfhwh6,null,t1_crffxyr,null,null,null,1433173454,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

**T** - Title: Analyse the title, give any obvious hints to what it might be about

**E** - Emotion: Is it sad? Happy? Confusing?

**M** - Message: Is the meaning behind the poem implied or is it explicit? What morals or messages is the poet trying to portray?

**P** - Pictures: Metaphors? Similes? What effect do these have? What imagery do you see from the poem? 

**L** - Lines &amp; Layout: Is is a sonnet? (Tells us that the poem is traditional, gives a sense of ""love"") Rhyming couplets? Is there hesitations or pauses?

**E** - Explaination: Why has the poet used a metaphor? Why are they exaggerating points? What effect do certain phrases have and why?


Hope this helps. Remember to ""write a lot from a little"", and make as many connections between the poems as possible when comparing.

A more equal UK will benefit all of us, and a more equal EU will benefit all of us too. The rich in the UK will need to take responcibility for causing this inequality, as well as bearing some of the burden of fixing it. The same goes for the UK, we are rich in the EU, so we must take this responcbility, and bear the burden for the greater good.

Oh nice to know. I didn't know that Schulze could be adapted to STV.

&gt; Having said that, in general elections I would still prefer a standard Droop STV despite the fact that it lends itself to Hylland and Woodall free riding, and in single winner cases when it doesn't fulfil Condorcet or monotonicity. It's just simpler. 

Given that most systems that implement STV require a computer to do the actual calculation (even if you were to manually count the ballots) does it matter that it's more complicated? It's the same way people understand that they can use computer encryption without understanding how it works.

This is fair.

null,false,benowillock,null,null,null,"So I would consider myself a ""liberal"" as you put it, I'm all for equality and 100% in favour of gay marriage, but in this case I actually agree with you, LaraDollar.

[The Marriage \(Same Sex Couples\) act 2013](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/30/contents/enacted/data.htm) specifically states that religious ceremonies, i.e. by a religious authority and/or in a place of worship is opt-in, meaning that no-one can force a vicar to marry a same sex couple if it infringes on his religious rights. I don't think anyone would say that this is an unreasonable contingency, the same sex couple can marry in a non-religious ceremony or find a religious authority who will marry them.

Therefore it should be reasonable to expect that those same rights that are afforded to vicars/priests/rabbi/imams should be extended to certain privately owned small businesses where providing a service to a same sex couple in certain circumstances would be unacceptable to them or cause them significant offence provided there are other places to get that service that will provide it and that the couple has not shown a willingness to find an alternative business, as in this case. Its a cake, there's bound to be a bakery somewhere that would be willing to do this.

Of course I get why we have these specific anti-discriminatory laws, and I'm not even implying they should be modified or removed, but laws are there as a legal basis for a case, not to be enforced rigidly in all cases, and in this case, at least externally, it looks like the ruling was not a reasonable use of whatever law the case was based upon. 

That being said, we don't know what went on or what was said and for all we know the business owners could've been extremely vile and unreasonable to the customers just because they were homosexual and obviously the judge found sufficient reason to make the ruling and I'm fairly sure he knows both the letter and the spirit of the law better than we all do.

Originally, each serial had its own title, like ""The Daleks"", and each episode also had its own title, like the first ep is called ""The Dead Planet"".  I suppose either name, and/or the episode number could be on those.

Around serial number 26, they stopped naming the individual episodes and just left the serial title.  You'll probably see them as ""Revenge of the Cybermen Episode 1-5"" or something of the sort.

The 36 marker (comparison) MS:

6.1 insightful exploratory response to text

6.2 close analysis of detail to support interpretation

6.3 evaluation of writers’ uses of language and/or structure and/or form and effects on readers

6.4 convincing/imaginative interpretation of ideas/themes

6.5 evaluative comparison of ideas and/or meanings and/or techniques

6.6 evaluative selection of a range of telling details into comparison

So basically you have to give a good topic sentence, followed by suitable quotes, then analyse language/structure/form (Note: don't be a slave to devices - you don't have to have one to form your point, if there is interesting imagery or connotations like ""the whole summer sky"" then that still satisfies the ""language""), then you have to zoom out and look at the overall theme of the poem and how it fits in. You then have to make an obvious comparison using a comparative word such as ""similarly"" or ""however"" (the easier you make it for the examiner the more marks you will get), followed by a quote from the poem you are comparing it to, with some very brief analysis.

I missed soccer a ton after graduating from High School in the spring of 2013. It was the first time I was not playing organized soccer since I first signed up when I was 5 and I had no plans to even try and play at the college level, so I decided to do some research to find a EPL club to support. I followed the league loosely for a few years, but it was hard to support one a specific team without TV coverage of the games. I watched loads videos (documentaries, highlights, etc.), read tons of articles, and read each and every one of the Premier League Previews by /u/Growlbot_ which helped a lot [(here is the post about Swansea that helped me decide)](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1jyxem/premier_league_201314_team_preview_1220_swansea/).

I spent a lot of time making my decision because I wanted to make sure the first club I picked was a team that I wanted to (and would be able to) follow for a long time. I wanted to pick a team that wasn't a perennial title contender, but also a team that I thought would stay in the top flight and be able to contend in the future with the way the club was headed. Pretty much a mid-table club (16th-6th was the range I was looking for) with potential. So I decided to support Swansea.

I liked their possession oriented play style, the color scheme, their promotion story, and a whole lot more. NBC sports showing every EPL game has allowed me to watch almost every game, but it's not always easy to wake up at 7am every Saturday (or the occasional 4:30am game -- ugh), so a few times I have slept through it and watched a replay. I started supporting at the beginning of the season with NBC coverage of every game, so the timing could not have been better.

I'm am glad with the team I chose to support. Picking a team to support half way around the world is a little different than just supporting the teams from the town I grew up in (Los Angeles), but I still follow them as closely and want them to succeed just as much as any team I follow here in LA.

I just can't get enough Swansea and look forward to the game every weekend. At least I have the /r/Dodgers to follow in the summers.",null,0,null,1432150904,null,0,false,0,crfjwfq,null,t3_36nmum,null,t1_crfjwfq,null,t3_36nmum,null,null,null,1433174396,null,7,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,7,null

&gt;The first victims came from the Asian Community.

Source?

Once more:

&gt;-*Ceop identified 144 victims of the Type 1 groups. Again, the data was incomplete. Gender was mentioned in 118 cases*. **All were female. Some 97 per cent of victims were white.**

http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-grooming-gangs/18739

&gt;The news was filled with us saying ""That's really not on. Why didn't the cops tell us this was happening and we would have helped"".

Massively contradicting yourself here. You just said the grooming gangs were reported to the police by those within the Pakistani community, now you're saying they didn't know and would've done something about it if they had.

&gt;*Pakistani community leaders in Rotherham were complicit in hushing up the shocking ‘ethnic’ dimensions of the sexual exploitation rather than speaking out, it was claimed yesterday.
Parveen Qureshi, director of the United Multicultural Centre in Rotherham, revealed the shocking issue was widely discussed between leaders who were privately ‘trying to resolve the problem’. 
She refused to name those who kept quiet, but was certain the problem of Asian men abusing white girls was known ‘for a long time’.*

&gt;*Whispering was going on in the community,’ she said.
Speaking to BBC Radio Sheffield, she said: ‘It was discussed, a discussion was going on in the community with community leaders and organisations and other agencies who were aware of what was happening and were trying to resolve the problem.’
No councillors or religious leaders from the Pakistani Muslim community have spoken in the media since the report’s publication on Tuesday.*

&gt;*Mrs Qureshi works daily at the centre for the significant Pakistani community in the South Yorkshire town. 
Commenting on local knowledge about horrific cases of young girls being exploited by sexual predators, she said: ‘It was not started overnight it was going on for a long time. 
‘It was always discussed in the community.’*

&gt;People ACTIVELY stated this and your response is ""I don't believe that"".

You haven't provided a single source for your claims. And most of them are completely contradicted by the readily available facts. You even contradict yourself.

&gt;I repeat. You do know that sexual abuse is poorly reported in the Asian Community right? Where victims of rapes often refuse to testify as being raped is still seen as a major slur on a woman's honour and admitting to being raped is tantamount to social suicide?

That's a fair enough point, and I accept it.

That's your opinion and you're entitled to it. IMHO that outlook comes from a rather one-sided view of things. Would you advocate a new Empire, then?

&gt; slaves were captured and sold by Africans.

This is quite true. Also, Britain never upheld slavery, see the rather pleasing case of [James Somerset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_v_Stewart), also British anti-piracy patrols were instrumental in killing the trade off for good. 

&gt;The slave trade is taught in schools and is taught incorrectly in my opinion 

I disagree. I don't think anyone is really presenting an inaccurate account.

&gt; India

That was definitely very complex and by no means were the Mughals much different to the empire the succeeded them. There is the question of ruthlessness though. For example, the practice of execution of tying across cannons aka [blowing from a gun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowing_from_a_gun) - yes it was taken from Mughal tradition but the British used it much more frequently during the sepoy rebellion. Either way, I do think we still need to talk about India an awful lot more in schools though, since we have such a rising tide of anti-immigrant feeling.

&gt; It's not some obviously 'evil empire'.

Seriously, go read about what happened in West Africa. It's no different from the Spanish conquistadors. Or, I'd settle for an admission that you'd never heard of the Ashanti before (point being that we don't talk about the worst examples).

I'm not even going to start on Iraq.

&gt; I guess my worry is that GCSE level doesn't have sufficient depth to do it justice and would just end up with a shallow treatment that would either lean too much to the right or too much to the left.

There has been a lot of attempts to rewrite history as the season has progressed to pretend those predictions didn't happen but BR and Werner were both bullish about us challenging again, BR saying we were a year ahead of schedule - doesn't that mean a title challenge like last year was the expectation again?

And that was after Suarez went. A huge blow for sure but anyone who thought he wasn't off to Barca after his antics in the 2013 window was deluded. Most ppl on here expected it &amp; saw his contract extension as just a bargaining chip - we had lots of time to prepare. Same will Sturridge. Everyone knew Suarez was off a long time in advance, everyone knew Sturridge was brilliant but prone to injuries when we signed him. Unlucky? Maybe. Woefully, inexcusably underprepared for it happening? Definitely.

&gt;

&gt;__Linking R__ and __intrusive R__ are [sandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhi) or *linking* phenomena  involving the appearance of the [rhotic consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic_consonant) (which normally corresponds to the letter ⟨r⟩) between two consecutive morphemes where it would not normally be pronounced. These phenomena occur in many [non-rhotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-rhotic) [varieties of English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dialects_of_the_English_language), such as those in most of England and Wales, part of the United States, and all of the southern hemisphere. These phenomena first appeared in English sometime after the year 1700.

Clutch control is hard!

The instructor I had (derek) was very good, I've never ridden before, just watched lots of YouTube videos.

There was 4 in my group, 3 of us made it on the road, but even the 4th was given allot of help to try and get him up to scratch, when it became apparent he wasn't going out with us, the 2nd instructor (for the road part) spent time with him while we did classroom stuff. 

You got a lemon and it's not your fault. CBT is compulsory BASIC TRAINING, you don't go in with any knowledge, and by the letter of the law, wouldn't know clutch from brake. 

One helpful tip I heard on a podcast (Adam savage- this is only a test podcast) when your in the spotlight 5 seconds feels like an age, take a breath, get prepared. No one will notice.

I sympathised with the **French**, not the terrorists, because the terrorists were just some dumb lowlifes from the Middle East that weren't educated enough to know a damn thing about how the world works.   
I wasn't offended by the cartoons, but I see how other more devout Muslims could be. It's like offending anyone from any religion by insulting the very people and sacred artefacts they think about almost every day. The people I think were offended were the older ones, around 40+ years old. Muslims born in this country tend to keep UK laws higher than sharia laws, at least that's what I've seen. Many imams (islamic priests) around the country were talking about how killing people is completely unacceptable, and how it should not be seen as justice.   
The point I'm trying to make is that everyone's opinions and views are different, and for the most part I think a lot of Muslims in Britain are civilised and know well enough the difference between right and wrong.

&gt; Children Boards have a responsibility towards the training of persons who work with
&gt; children or in services affecting the safety and welfare of children. ...
&gt; By 2012, it seemed that child sexual exploitation had become a standard feature in
&gt; the planning of training programmes. A training package in CSE was designed for
&gt; Muslim community leaders; and the Safeguarding Board provided a training course in
&gt; the identification of indicators relating to CSE.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; The UK Muslim Women's Network produced a report on CSE in September 2013
&gt; which drew on 35 case studies of women from across the UK who were victims, the
&gt; majority of whom were Muslim.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; The Deputy Children's Commissioner’s report reached a similar conclusion to the
&gt; Muslim Women's Network research, stating 'one of these myths was that only white

We (and Gomes) look at Spurs from the inside but the reality is that the prevalence for youngsters 'not making it' is a football-wide thing; players sign as very young - in some cases as young as 15 or 16 - for massive contracts under pressure from parents and agents. They think they've made it, and then don't. 

I mean, look at Chelsea - would anyone in their right mind tell a young player not to sign for Chelsea? Of course not. But go ask Gael Kakuta, a very highly thought of prospect, how that worked out. Go ask Lucas Paizon. Etc etc etc.

He's now denying having said it without actually denying it, but Gomes seems to miss the point completely; Gomes made an incredible number of cock ups and eventually ended up 3rd choice. The club didn't do it out of spite, he simply became the 3rd most reliable GK at the club, and he seems to have taken it personally, which is understandable but kind of missing the point.

Anyway, yes, young players should absolutely join a club like Spurs. The reality is that to get into a top 6 club's match 16, you already need to be an international standard, that's the criteria.

I'm pretty sure I didn't do that on my CBT until we were at least 1-1.5 hours in, and we all did every step after one another.

 You were not supposed to be taken out on the road before at least spending 2-3 hours practicing, and doing all the maneuvers and stuff, so maybe after about 12-1 o'clock. You should been given ample time to get used to your bike, and be confident with low speed clutch control.

Any half-decent instructor will NOT let a student out on the road if they are not confident in their ability to carry on with the road portion of the training.

I suggest you write a complaint to the DVSA (I think they regulate schools) and find a better, more reputable school.

I can suggest mine in west London, i passed both my CBT and DAS on first try, had very patient instructors who always explained everything and answered any questions, and were very thorough in our training.

Your correct in your last point but I still think it would be possible to find a way to regulate the sale of the more dangerous drugs, which to be honest are the drugs we should be focusing on, the problem with legalising cannabis at the moment is working out how to monetise it properly.

If I were to set out a system I'd have drugs like MDMA and ketamine limited to x number of time a month schemes due to their toxicity-  physcedelics , amphetamines and cocaine would be on another scheme with regular health check ups and sort of a license/membership scheme that would stagger the amount you could buy at a time with a health check up every few months or years etc possible prescription replacements could be offered if ADHD/mental illness etc is present. 

Heroin, methamphetamines , crack cocaine, pcp etc I would have only sold in clinics dedicated to their use. Like shooting galleries in Canada and so on. The clinics would be sort of like a hostel where the users pay a little money (I'd hope it would help people see it as a harm reduction service rather than a stigmatised shamed 'junkie booth') to stay and use a little booth to use their drug which would be sold on site in a pharmacy. 

You could sell week take home scripts for users that are working as having to go to the pharmacy every day can hinder some from being able to find jobs. 

There would also be one night stay beds , showers and calm isolation rooms (with like art books and bean bags etc)  as we would be expecting there to be some mental illness present sometimes and people do freak out on stims , so there would be health services there too. 

The idea would be to get people 'within the system' so to say as early into their use as possible rather then when its too late and the  only time they come into the system is when they get arrested for stealing someones radio to buy a £10 bag of crushed nytol, brown sugar and fentanyl which they later go home to overdose on. 

You could double up on the service if you had the money and open up an education centre or community meeting centre within it, with the intent of having sort of like harm reduction information sessions but also maybe offer a chance for people (drug users or non drug users) to make new acquaintances through meet and greets, as addiction is often a symptom of people that are suffering and human connection is a great tool to treat addiction. 

Its obviously often going to be better than people feeling totally disconnected from the community around them.

null,false,cuthred,null,null,null,"&gt;Given that most systems that implement STV require a computer to do the actual calculation (even if you were to manually count the ballots) does it matter that it's more complicated? It's the same way people understand that they can use computer encryption without understanding how it works.

I just meant that it adds another layer of complexity to the system which if there were a referendum would make it less likely to win over the status quo because the electorate can't easily understand it, and probably doesn't care that it fulfils a few more mathematical criteria than a normal STV system. As far as I can tell most people who want to change the voting system care about it being proportional and they care about local representation. It's possible to have meaningful discussion about accountability, but having to explain [all of this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system#Mathematical_criteria) is laborious. Schulze also adds a few more rules to voting so the ballot paper could get a little confusing. Maybe not.

&gt;This is fair. My main complaint with STV was losing single winner constituencies, but recently I've started to change my views on this (because current constituencies are too small and seem pretty pointless in populated areas). I sort of like MMP because it separates party from local representation more (so I can feel like I can vote for the party I want to win separate from my constituency), but I realize people don't like the party choosing MPs.

I used to think that, but at the moment I live in a safe seat with an MP from a party I don't support. I want to be able to approach an MP with my problems who has views closer to mine and will have sympathy where we slightly disagree, I'd be more comfortable approaching an MP from my preferred party or at least a party closer to me. Under STV this is far more likely as there'd be more people who represent me and I could talk to any of them. I dislike MMP for reasons I've already stated, you can't vote people out and the methods by which parties choose their list wouldn't necessarily get rid of unpopular candidates. MMP also forces tactical voting in constituencies, I know this doesn't affect the proportionality of it, but it still feels dirty.

Of course I would far prefer any of the mentioned systems to our current one, and I can only hope that if we ever get a referendum on it that it has only two choices (status quo and the proposed system of change), I wouldn't trust the government to use a good method to determine the winner from multiple choices.

The other issue is the way the Empire viewed those countries through the lenses of race. So when people came here from former colonial countries they were abused and victimised.

When he was stuck sitting next to Gerrard he still had more forward at the beginning of the season I guess you could call him a typical DM, but it didn't last long before BR dropped him.

Rodgers doesn't like the traditional scrappy, combative anchor in the midfield. He demands more dynamic play from all of his midfielders. I don't think he's about to change his mind and start playing a traditional DM type of role in his formations and tactics either as he's shown no inclination towards it.

No they didn't. Seriously? You assume there is some sort of Asian Newsletter that goes out identifying how we should behave each week!

Rotherham is a small town. The Asian/Pakistani community constitutes only 3% of it (http://www.rotherham.gov.uk/jsna/info/23/people/54/ethnicity_and_cultural_identity). Thousands of young girls were groomed and raped in that period. 

&gt;*The 27 court cases that we found led to the convictions of 92 men*. **Some 79 (87 per cent) were reported as being of South Asian Muslim origin.**

http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-grooming-gangs/18739

Are you seriously going to tell me that no-one within the said small community knew what was going on? Even when presented with a director of a multicultural centre for that very community (herself of Pakistani heritage) in Rotherham saying there was knowledge of it?

You're appealing to emotion and making flawed arguments. You're not providing anything to support your points, and you're routinely contradicting yourself.

You're interpreting this as an attack against you simply because you possibly share the same ethnicity as the perpetrators in this case, and you're getting extremely defensive about it as a result.

Of course many far-right racists do use examples like this to demonise everyone of group X,Y, or Z.

But those people shouldn't be used to gloss over uncomfortable cultural norms which may have contributed to such abuse for example. Those people shouldn't be used as an excuse to ring fence this topic so that no-one can reflect upon why or how it happened. And you shouldn't interpret anyone who runs a critical eye over this topic as one of those opportunistic racists.

People like yourself shouldn't withdraw into a defensive shell when the topic comes up, that's precisely why things like this don't change.

People should be free to run a critical eye over this topic without being shouted down as far-right or racist, if ordinary people can't express a critical opinion on a topic like this then that only leaves the racists to do it.

You are on society's side. Do not withdraw into a defensive shell when this topic comes up simply because you share an arbitrary thing in common with the groomers in question. Speak out about the opportunistic far-right racists, but don't allow yourself to retreat into a defensive shell. None of us want something like this to happen again, and that means reflecting upon the uncomfortable points like culture, race and religion, and determining what was contributory and what wasn't.

This was in response to his comment. Even if it was in ""general"" still yet to see anyone anywhere say that Tory deserve no seats. Especially if they're arguing for reform.

&gt; I'm saying there are people who I think might be using electoral reform as a disguise for Tory bashing and I don't like that approach.

Sure a general vague there are ""people"" who may not like Tories, but there ""people"" who don't like UKIP either and reform would actually help UKIP party. We could generalise all day long, there always going be somebody who don't like a particular party which  most benefit from FPTP be it Tory, Labour, Lib Dems or SNP, who argues for electoral reform. Doesn't make the argument for reform any less valid because some one might just happen not to like a particular party. It be impossibly to find anyone who has a completely non-bias view towards all parties.

So far all you done is force your own narrative over people reasons and that is ""You don't like tories, therefore you're bashing on them because you want reform"". You also don't seem to pin it down to anybody either, it just this vague nebulous accusation against some vague body of people who might make up a bit of those who want reform and happen to be on the far-left.

not only that, he is far superior on the left wing but for most of his games this season on the wing sterling has been shoved on the right. go look at th statistics when compared left vs right

when he has played uptop as the CF, he may not have been finishing all his chances but like i said he is the only one (besides maybe sturridge or llalana) that seemingly gets himself into actual goal scoring positions. if he had a better left foot he would have probably an extra 5 to 10 goals

okay? you want him to sign a contract? congrats? you want consistant football? 

the club and himself are responsible for his poor turn of form. i dont think rodgers switching formations constantly, and especially going back to a putrid formation that hasnt worked since the start of the season doesnt help

im sorry ifits childish and offputting. those are two of /r/liverpoolfc's best qualities. dunno wtf u expect here mate.

a wall of text? it was a fuckin paragraph. fuck are you on about.

alexis sanchez lol. i doubt alexis sanchez has ever played in a system like rodgers fuckin systems that expect players to cover huge amounts of space. the dude puts gerrard in the middle of the pitch, who cant cover the wings at all (like lucas used to), and then we are all upset at sterling because he cant cover the whole entire wing and get forward and create AND finish his chances? and now you want him to be like alexis sanchez (maybe a top 20 player in the world)?

null,false,Muzer0,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,null,"There are some services that now get declassified as a matter of course in the peaks. For example, the ""Salisbury 6"" local services (Salisbury to Romsey via Romsey and Southampton) are declassified in the timetable. There are plenty of Southern services that are also declassified in the timetable; these say it on the internal passenger information screens. I've encountered services that (admittedly mostly in times of disruption) have been declassified by the guard, from a variety of operators — South West Trains, Virgin (West Coast), Southern, even CrossCountry to name but a few (the ones that immediately spring to mind).

The issue is, when you have a peak time service, it's ALWAYS going to be busy. There's really not much you can do about that in many cases; trains have already been lengthened to the maximum possible length (even taking into account platform extensions) and the line is full to capacity. There are obviously upgrades going on to improve things like this but it's a slow process. But anyway, my point is that if you start declassifying first on occasions like these, you'll end up ALWAYS having to declassify it. At which point you're not fulfilling your franchise obligations and providing a first class service, assuming others are correct and it is a franchise obligation. And those who buy first class seasons would be pretty pissed off that the train operator never provide first class accommodation (if it's declassified, it is by definition not first class accommodation). This does not apply when the guard selectively upgrades individuals, but then you have the issue of who to prioritise.

As I have said elsewhere, I would not be opposed to a removal of first class altogether on some routes, but this is something that, unfortunately, needs to be agreed with the micromanaging DfT, and that isn't always forthcoming. This is mostly due to the franchising system which is basically a mess.

Unfortunately, on services without guards it's quite tough because there's (usually) nobody there to see how busy it is. This is one reason (besides the obvious) I don't believe Driver Only Operation should be used on routes with first class (or vice versa, depending on how you want to phrase it).



But in any case, the solution to all this is not to go ""fuck the rules I'm sitting in first class"". A penalty fare is really the kindest thing the TOC could have done is such an incident; penalty fares are designed for cases of  honest mistakes (something else which I think is kind of fucked up, incidentally); occasions where deliberate fare evasion is suspected are often taken further.",null,0,null,1432155940,null,0,false,0,crfn75s,null,t3_36lziu,null,t1_crfn75s,null,t1_crfke3p,null,null,null,1433175949,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

'Saxondale' a little known series...very funny about a ex roadie turned pest controller
'Peep Show' one of the best comedy series ever
'An idiot aboard' again different tone to Red Dwarf, documentary style about a guy with a head like a fucking orange traveling about the place (though it was done by Gervais and merchant and you said you didn't like the office, Karl Pilkington is in a league of his own)
'The Might Boosh' is worth trying, not everyone's cup of tea, but once you get hooked you will love it
And an absolute must if you like unusual series is 'Garth Meranghi's Darkplace' 
And satirical series, have a look at 'Brass Eye' by Chris Morris, or anything by Charlie Brooker 'weekly wipe' or try 'Black Mirror', black mirror isn't a comedy series, but it is by far one of the most interesting series ever made.

1. Inflation
2. Debts are owned domestically
3. They can print their own money.
4. A country's economic activity is with itself
5. A government should limit borrowing because it crowds out private investment.

1. Okay, well 3 and 1 are the same. **In practice the government of a developed nation is not going to print its own money or choose a higher inflation rate to inflate away its debts**. I've already linked you the paper explaining why, in short because the costs to doing so are too great. Yes printing money doesn't cause inflation over the short term, but in the long term it does. To all intents and purposes it is a given that inflation is 2% over the medium term, no more no less. Central banks of developed nations don't have a mandate to inflate away debts when they become inconvenient.

2. Debts being owned domestically is not important, why you say? Because you can't write off debts just because they are owned domestically, and there is no advantage to taxing people in the future to pay off debts incurred now, you might as well tax them now. This is like a household for the following reason: If you spend more than you earn you have to borrow, saying you can tax people in the future is like saying well a household can borrow now because they earn more money in the future. It may be possible, but its sub optimal.

4. A countries economic activity is mostly with itself. This is true, but irrelvant, its a governments budget we are talking about here not a countries. A country can do most of its economic activity with martians for all it matters, the bottom line is the governments income and expenditure.

5. Yeah fair point, the analogy isn't 100%, but wasn't your argument that the government shouldn't limit borrowing because debts don't matter that much?

We have a Christian head of state. We understand and occasionally make references to biblical happenings or characters. When we stub our toes, we shout *'JESUS CHRIST!'*

I'm not Christian, but if I *had* to put a religion on a form? It'd be Christian. 

It's absolutely not meaningless to acknowledge the cultural reach of a religion you don't follow, especially if it indirectly affects huge portions of your day to day life, your upbringing, and your general philosophy.

Well I am hoping to hit at least 1/2 of these.

Its good to be on a course you are happy with, it is hard enough work studying something you enjoy, let alone something you hate. I wonder if the American system is better where you take all different classes in year 1 and then declare a major later. I reckon most people aren't 100% sure what they want to study at age 17 (I certainly wasn't). There were people in my 6th form taking a subject for degree level that they had never studied before eg. law which seems like a huge gamble.

null,false,Taure,null,null,null,"It both makes economic sense and has been borne out historically.

1. Economic sense. This is based on the fact that when you can move easily, tax jurisdictions are in competition with each other for business. Changing your legal base of operations is not onerous within a single market. You don't have to change your operations, you just change your company legal structure so that the holding company making the profit is located in the tax jurisdiction you want (consider Amazon and Luxembourg). As you're within the same single market, capital transfers etc are easy. Obviously you will choose to pay tax in the lowest taxing jurisdiction, and that jurisdiction will benefit from getting that tax revenue. But other jurisdictions see what's happened and realise they can do the same, and so undercut that tax rate to entice businesses to go to them instead.

2. It is what happened in the EU. EU member states compete on corporation tax to entice businesses to set up HQ in their country. Ireland changed their corporation tax from 32% in 1998 to 12.5% in 2003. UK corporation tax has gone from 30% in 2007 to 20% in 2015. Etc.

Edit: Oh, also, another problem with devolution of tax raising and spending powers to regions: it exacerbates regional inequality. Poorer regions raise less revenue, so can invest less, so don't get richer. Rich areas raise more, invest more, and get even richer. Without fiscal transfers between regions via a central government, this just perpetuates itself. At the moment there's a huge transfer of wealth out of London to the rest of the UK. If you make regions responsible for their own tax and spend, London is going to keep all the tax raised in London and leave the rest of the UK in the dust.

Living in Northern Ireland?
You can choose to submit your Passport Express application from over 70 Post Offices.

Step by step guide:
Get an APS 2E passport application form from one of the many post offices.
Once your passport application has been completed correctly and you have all the relevant documents, bring these to any of the listed post offices. Then purchase a Passport Express envelope and hand your application to a counter clerk.
Payment should then be made by credit/debit cards, cash or cheque.
Once payment is made, you will be issued with a receipt. Keep this receipt in a safe place as it contains the tracking number for your passport application. It is also the reference point if you wish to make any queries concerning your application.
The Passport Service aims to have passports back in 10 working days from the day we receive it (this is subject to the demand at the time). For first time applicants or those who are replacing lost or stolen books, the processing time can take up to 15 working days., provided the application has been submitted correctly.",null,0,null,1432157662,null,0,false,0,crfo902,null,t3_36mi1e,null,t1_crfo902,null,t3_36mi1e,null,null,null,1433176517,null,6,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,6,null

What is the endgame?  because eliminating the national debt cannot seriously be an option. The deficit maybe, but we have run deficits on both left and right for decades.  A surplus so we can offer a tax cut for the wealthy? A right thats got to be well worth selling off every public service in the country. 

Better hope those tax cuts are enough to help cover private health care and school fees.
I'm seriously thinking these cunts will see armed resistance if this is their master plan.

Your new bike can go on the road for two weeks without tax, after this, it MUST have it.

Just keep the receipt just in case. I went through the manual and asked the guys to show me around anything that I may need to know. What comes under wear and tear items and not applicable to warranty.

I have no regrets. Just remember the engine needs a running in period, tyres need scrubbing in. (All new tyres do) brakes will need to be applied gently. Unless an emergency arises and you MUST use them, then do so.

Keep the bike clean, keep an eye on oil level. Pay attention to any warning lights. Tyre pressures are more important on a bike than a car. Check them for gouges, cracks, splits, etc.

I'd keep some spare bulbs with you as a precaution. VOSA and Police can do a road-side check to ensure your bike is road-legal.

Know how to replace bulbs should the need arise.

Premier League was always shown in our region, but when swansea got promoted to the premiership in 2011, it was nothing new to me. In 2011 there were a few months where I had extensive leisure time and used them to watch almost every game of the premier league. Was observing a lot of good players coming up. One player I started paying attention to was Nathan Dyer. I'd seen a few games and fell in love the way he used his pace on the field. Leon Britton's flair caught totally gripped me. During that time I heard the commentator say that this newly promoted club was once sold for 1 pound. This made me read Swansea's history there and then on my phone as Michu made his presence felt at the Liberty stadium in the background. I felt so happy Swansea at that time. I kept following them regularly and here I am today. A 100% Jack. 
I felt so delighted when we won against Arsenal the other day. What a performance by Fabianski.

It seems like Adam Pearson is having a somewhat calming influence at the club. If what he is saying is true, club secretary and head of recruitment etc., then we are going to have more people to potentially sway Cellino from craziness. As long as they can keep Cellino from making too many crazy decision, it could be a good season for us.

What happened to Redfearn is a disgrace and i wouldn't begrudge him leaving, but i hope he stays and helps bring through more academy stars to the first team.

Of course this could all be a case of right man, wrong time. It all rests on what Cellino is going to do and whether he will give Rosler the time and control he needs to build this squad into a premier league team. 

I am quietly optimistic.

As a point of reference Korea will give you a 3 month VISA-ON-ARRIVAL.

Some general info for working in Korea:
Get a public(state) school Job (EPIK), not a Hag-won / academy job. 
Seoul isn't everything. I've lived in small, medium cities as well tiny as the country side cities. 
  - Korea has a 2 major high-speed rail likes from the South-east (Mokpo - Seoul) and South-West (Busan-Seoul) diverging in Deajeon. (40K - 60K KRW) on the day.
  - Korea has a major inter-city bus network with coaches leaving every 5-10mins to major cities. (8K - 15K KRW) on the day.
Really puts the UK to shame considering where taxes we pay over Korea.

Anyway, good luck with your job hunt and where ever you end up.

The non-religious jew is practically a concrete stereotype in American media now, helped by the likes of Woody Allen and Jon Stewart. They're not religious and they rarely attend services, but they *are* Jewish when asked, because it means more to them than actually believing in the Jewish god and scripture. It carries a whole different set of cultural apparatus, and really defines who they see themselves as.

The same goes for a lot of British Muslims, and I expect within a few decades they'll have a similar attitude to current non-religious Jews.

Make a batter. 

This entails whisking together flour and a liquid until you get batter. You can use milk, beer, water, free range organic bean juice what ever.

Preheat oven to around 180? Something like that.

Cut cauli into florets.

I tend to massively over batter mine so I make them in a fairy cake type tin with lots of depressions so the batter can't run.

Bake until cooked. Doesn't take long 15 minutes tops. I tend to go by nose.


For the spicy sauce the recipes say mix hot sauce with melted butter. I only do this if I am.feeling extravagant.

Something like 1 tblspoon of melted butter and half a cup?? Of hot sauce. Usually franks is recommended but I normally just use a blend of what ever is to hand. Cholula usually.

Use a pastry brush to coat your battered cauliflowers. Bung them back in the oven until they look done. This will take 10 minutes max.


Some recipes advise leaving them for 20 minutes after that. But I usually commence stuffing them in my face straight away.

And while you're at it you can show me the details of the 1400 young girls that Hindu rape gangs abused in the 21st century, since again, other groups do this same thing en masse on racial lines, according to you none of this is endemic to any Islamic community, its all just a narrative and all religions are doing it. 

Because you know what, indisputable though your point is, its not tremendously relevant unless you can demonstrate that it is what is occurring here. And to do that you would need to prove that these acts are being committed by other groups and that it is being suppressed, or covered more favorably, or manipulated into a higher degree of acceptability.

**T** - Title: Analyse the title, give any obvious hints to what it might be about

**E** - Emotion: Is it sad? Happy? Confusing?

**M** - Message: Is the meaning behind the poem implied or is it explicit? What morals or messages is the poet trying to portray?

**P** - Pictures: Metaphors? Similes? What effect do these have? What imagery do you see from the poem? 

**L** - Lines &amp; Layout: Is is a sonnet? (Tells us that the poem is traditional, gives a sense of ""love"") Rhyming couplets? Is there hesitations or pauses?

**E** - Explaination: Why has the poet used a metaphor? Why are they exaggerating points? What effect do certain phrases have and why?


Hope this helps. Remember to ""write a lot from a little"", and make as many connections between the poems as possible when comparing.

null,false,yrro,null,null,null,"Is there a letting agent? They will probably charge you a fee to start your contract and another fee when you renew every 6-12 months.

You'll have to fork over 4-6 weeks rent up front as a safety deposit, which landlord/agent must keep with an accredited organization. When you move out, they will assess the property for any damage you may have caused and try to make deductions from the amount they will return to you to cover repairs. Depending on how scummy they are, they may do this fairly, or they may try to charge you for every little thing including what is clearly regular wear and tear.

Your best defence against scummy landlords/agents is to take photos of everything when you move in--the flat itself and the furniture--and get the letting agent/landlord to sign &amp; date them. If the agent/landlord claims to have photos of their own, ask to take a copy of them and compare them to your own. These photos are your best tool for getting your full deposit back.

You'll have to pay council tax--the agent/landlord _should_ know which band the property is in, and from that you can find out how much it will be on the council's web site. Council tax is usually paid in 10 instalments, so you pay a bit more for 10 months and then have 2 months off paying it. I believe you have the right to request to be billed evenly over 12 months if that suits you better.

As for other bills, you'll have electricity (which may be high if you have electric hobs/cooker/showers/heaters) and probably gas. Hard to say how much they'll be up front. You can shop around for an electricity/gas provider--follow the links to comparison sites from moneysavingexpert.com.

You'll have no choice of water provider. Your flat may have a water meter, or you may be charged a fixed rate based on the fact that it's a 2 bedroom flat. You have the right to request that the water company fit a water meter. They will then have to inspect the property, and install one if possible.

It looks like it cost about $5000 to make. Not enough budget for decent girls either.

null,false,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,null,"Norway consistently runs a large surplus. Luxembourg, Switzerland and Germany aim for approximate balance. South Korea also aims for balance.

Balance is not strictly necessary for a country, because they can grow the debt year-on-year, if they increase taxes year on year (by virtue of a growing economy), and this can be sustained indefinitely. So, most economists suggest that continuously running a deficit and growing the debt is sensible, provided that it is not excessive.

Exactly where the point between sensible and excessive is, isn't terribly well defined. 

At the moment, the UK is running a 5-6% deficit each year, but economic growth is around 2-3%, so obviously this is not sustainable in the long term. What is not so clear, is for how long this is sustainable - at the moment, the UK can borrow money at rock-bottom interest rates, so at least for the short-term it is sustainable.

The problem with running a deficit and maintaining a huge debt, is that if investors, pension funds, etc. suddenly decide that the economy is not sustainable, then they will stop lending more money - and at that point things implode. This can happen very quickly, as happened to Greece recently, or happened in the UK in 1976 when the government needed an international bailout because the government was running a huge deficit, and investors lost confidence and refused to lend any more.",null,0,null,1432161552,null,0,false,0,crfqhkg,null,t3_36o2lq,null,t1_crfqhkg,null,t1_crfpcf3,null,null,null,1433177572,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

Surveys are bullshit. You can make a survey say anything you want with the right setup. For example....

* You can screw around with the sample and survey a biased group of people. 

* You can prime people with leading questions. You'd be surprised to learn that a question like ""The Asian population of the UK has increased by 1000% since 1971. If it increases at this rate till 2041, 1 in 2 people in the UK will be Asian. Is this a good thing?"" can SOMEHOW make people answer a question like the above differently. 

* You can ask vague and easy to misinterpret questions. Or just confuse people. Classic example is flipping the scales - for some questions, 1 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree. For other questions... You flip it.

ive always been honest in this sub.  i got into attending football games with the galaxy because thats what is here.  I support my home team.  So that said, when i started looking into Gerrard's history, dedication, hell..  his legend (i dont think thats too forward do say after what ive seen).  my worries were totally different than most fans.

ive had at least 6 actual fans in front of me ask ""is he as good as beckham?"" which made me want to die inside for just hearing the question.

My worries are that our supporters arent up for the job in front of them.  I've tried to explain the expectation and the responses i get are generally ""he'll like us or he can f off"" (im at work).

now im excited for Stevie when it comes to the club itself.  Bruce Arena is one hell of a coach.  Chris Klien is an organization president that appreciates what Stevie brings to the table (why hes getting a house in malibu, a condo at LA Live, the pay hes getting, several personal assistants for him and his family, as well as the marketting).  After seeing what Stevie has had to put up with since FSG took over LFC I think he deserves this kind of treatment.  That has me very excited for him.  He deserves this kind of treatment from his club.  He's Stevie effing Gerrard.

I'll do my best as a supporter.  I cant do what needs to be done alone.  But I'll try anyway.

Still, it's kind of gutting seeing the other fans at the stadium im at every week take it all for granted before he even shows up.

I am not sure there is even a single example myself. Also, a Christian popular culture is probably also to blame as well as a few angsty individuals.

Paedophilia, on the other hand, is a well-documented harmful sexual fetish not entirely unrelated to the well-known sexual fetish of ""schoolgirls"" or ""cute teens"" or ""twinks"" or any other sexual interest from men about young boys/females.

Not in Northern Ireland, where this cake shop is located.

&gt; What if a white bloke went into a black power cake shop (this area has a lot of extreme cake shops) and asked for a cake that said 'white people are ok'? Would you defend the business owners right to decide who he does and doesn't serve?

Refusing someone service on the basis of sex, race, religion etc. is, of course, discriminatory, but I don't think your hypothetical example is as clear cut as you think. *I* wouldn't be comfortable writing ""white people are ok"" on a cake.

Gas/electric average about £70/month. Avoid houses with a prepay/card meter and landlords who aren't happy with you changing supplier (you're legally allowed to change, but it probably gives you a good indicator of the sort of landlord you will have).

Telephone is £10/month and internet is another £10 or so on top. There's good deals to be had for new subscribers so you can get it for a lot less (or a lot more if you have specific requirements).

Council tax depends on area ... £130/month or so ... you can find out exactly how much online before you agree to rent the property.

Water is £15/month but again depends on area.

TV licence is another £10.

So, you're looking at an extra £200-£250 for bills each month. Most lettings agents want a deposit ... 1.5 months rent on average. Make sure it'll go into one of the government protected schemes (legally it has to) and not into the landlords' pocket.

The lettings agent will want a bundle of cash for letting you the property ... £75 inventory fee, £75 key fee, £75 contract fee, £75 reference fee. I did the process a couple of months ago and the fees were about £600 for the two of us. Fuck Taylors Estate Agents.

The biggest rookie mistake is not having an 'inventory' when you move in. The landlord should produce a document detailing the exact state of the property ... if he doesn't then do it yourself. Take pictures, detail every mark or blemish. Get people to sign it to say it is a correct representation of the property.

The day you move in will be exciting ... you'll grab a few beers and have a few laughs with your new flatmate.

null,false,The_Disco_Spider_,null,null,null,"&gt; sterling has shown that he is probably better sitting behind a striker than on the wing.

&gt; not only that, he is far superior on the left wing but for most of his games this season on the wing sterling has been shoved on the right. go look at th statistics when compared left vs right

Whilst I agree Raheem did excel in the no.10 position he's only played in it for half a season. He should be able to fall back to playing on the wings no problem considering that's the position he's been brought up in.

&gt;when he has played uptop as the CF, he may not have been finishing all his chances but like i said he is the only one (besides maybe sturridge or llalana) that seemingly gets himself into actual goal scoring positions. if he had a better left foot he would have probably an extra 5 to 10 goals

I agree that Sterling has deputised in the ST position very well, it's no coincidence our best run of form came around that same time this was happening. Although the if are a bit pointless, if Lallana and Sturridge had been fit all season they'd have scored more too.

&gt;okay? you want him to sign a contract? congrats? you want consistant football?

Don't really understand the snarkyness here, you literally asked me ""what exactly do you want from this kid"" and I answered. I told you exactly what I wanted whilst making a point that I'm not expecting the world from this kid.

&gt;im sorry ifits childish and offputting. those are two of /r/liverpoolfc's best qualities. dunno wtf u expect here mate.

Well I've never had a conversation here before that's devolved into anything like ""basically saying i'll do it cuz im better than it. and then gerrard will probably lose the ball anyway so doesnt matter its a shit fuck of a season""

&gt;a wall of text? it was a fuckin paragraph. fuck are you on about.

The whole comment, 5 paragraphs. It was long enough that on my phone it took up the whole screen, although that also made me think it was longer than it was.

&gt;alexis sanchez lol. i doubt alexis sanchez has ever played in a system like rodgers fuckin systems that expect players to cover huge amounts of space

Hmm, like the wide forward in a 4-3-3? Suppose Sanchez probably has never played there before.

&gt;and then we are all upset at sterling because he cant cover the whole entire wing and get forward and create AND finish his chances? 

We're upset because given Sterling's physical attributes and footballing skill he should be doing at least one of these things consistently, but he rarely does.

&gt;and now you want him to be like alexis sanchez (maybe a top 20 player in the world)?

My exact words when mentioning Alexis Sanchez were ""*I'm not saying they're on the same level, or it's what Raheem should be able to do.*""

It might have changed since i last read it, but Farage never actually resigned. He never sent a letter in resignation. The top brass of UKIP never got a letter to refuse his resignation.

Farage was going against his own party constitution as it should have meant a leadership election.

&gt;It has been alleged that Nigel Farage never formally resigned from Ukip as part of what party sources have told the Spectator was a stitch up to avoid a leadership contest.

&gt;It is claimed that the Ukip leader never wrote a letter to the party’s chairman tendering his resignation. He told the media on Friday that he would write to the party resigning. When it met on Monday, it is said the National Executive Committee had still not received a letter. A source tells me that when someone asked where the letter was, they were told ‘it is being typed out as we speak’. The source says the letter never appeared.

http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/05/exclusive-nigel-farage-never-resigned-from-ukip-in-stitch-up/

This isn't alarmism, it's a basic scientific fact. Our *existing reserves* are already many times greater than the reserves we can afford to burn to have a decent chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change. It is completely insane to start tapping into additional reserves. It's irrelevant if it's cleaner than coal because the choice isn't between shale gas and coal - we can't afford to continue burning either on a large scale. You also have to remember that all of this fracking industry isn't free - the government will be pumping a huge amount of money into it in terms of incentives for the private corporations responsible for the fracking. That's a ridiculous waste of public resources given that we can't afford to frack in the first place, and all of that money could be going towards genuinely sustainable forms of energy.

If you're going to live in a foreign country (whether you are born there or not, you are still foreign mostly due to name, culture and traditions) you need to: 

1. Follow the rules 
2. Integrate
3. Be grateful for being welcomed in their country and maybe obtaining British or whatever nationality. 
4. Stay loyal to your new country.
5. Work on your own life (education, work and etc.), make sure you and your family are upright and moral members of the society.
6. Uphold your religious duties - if you're religious. N/A for Atheists.
7. Hold on to your culture and traditions. At the end of the day, that's what makes you who you are. 
8. If you encounter any racism or discrimination, deal with it lawfully.
9. If you don't like it in whatever country you are in then you should get out of it as soon as possible.

We're not the only club that fucks up in the transfer market.

The difference is that when they spend £40m on a player and they flop, the club can take the financial hit in their stride. We can't.

Traditional pubs with older customers would be most likely to employ you with no experience behind the bar. However, they may not be the nicest environments to work in.


Hospitality generally, Edinburgh is awash with restaurants, cafes and bars that serve food. From my experience it would be easier to start off waiting tables as places will be more likely to fill these positions with people with no experience. If you write a good CV and show your transferable skills from customer service you should find something quite easily.


The plus of doing it this way is that you'll end up working in a nicer venue. If you work in a bar that serves food, if you show interest you may have the opportunity to train behind the bar giving you more options in the future.


The best way to apply for these jobs is to walk in and speak to the duty manager. Be personable and show confidence. It's half the battle. Also, bear in mind when you go in. Don't go lunchtime on a Friday, think Monday Tuesday morning between 9-11am. They'll have less customers and more time.

Under new labour something like a playground fight between primary school children would result in several ""detections"" (read: recorded violent crimes) for each child involved for physical actions, the parents of those involved for verbal threats against other parents, spitting at someone was classified as a violent crime and other bizarre things were recorded by police officers to meet ever increasing targets set at a national level. No action was ever taken for these bizarre crimes, for the record, but they still counted as ""detections"" for the officer who had the fortune to come across them, allowing him or her to hit their targets for the week.

The conservatives largely scrapped these bizarre targets, but ignored the growing afflictions of the populace, especially regarding mental health but as well as in other areas such as road traffic collisions, responding to suspected crimes where the suspect had fled and so on. May infamously said that the police force's job was to ""cut crime, nothing more"" which led to a large amount of public ridicule, notably from ""Inspector Gadget"" who quite rightly pointed out that police presence was required on any scene involving any violent crime involving a weapon, especially stabbings, where police officers would have to reach the scene and assess it before paramedics were allowed to respond, but again on the (largely ignored by this government) area of mental health, massive police presence would be required to talk down a ""jumper"" or otherwise suicidal individual. This also applies to road traffic collisions.

These police actions were no longer part of the detection scheme under the conservatives, as they weren't crimes per se, but they still chewed up massive amounts of police resources.

Now the police are at breaking point, crime is down because threatening to jump off a bridge is no longer allowed to be classed as a detected crime by the police, but it still requires a police presence. See also, RTCs, responding to suspected stabbings before a paramedic team is allowed on site, attending an area where a crime has been reported but the suspect has fled and so on ad infinitum.

**tl;dr some crimes are no longer crimes, police officers are still expected to respond to them**

Edit: for the record, from my other posts it may seem that I'm anti-copper, I'm not, I just think they're hamstrung by increasingly ridiculous government dictats, from the left's desire to make farting in public a crime to the right's desire to make everything except treason a non-crime. The police have no autonomy left, I feel sorry for the poor bastards, morale has bottomed out, mental health issues in the force are on the rise, the idea of a police officer enjoying his or her work is dead, the feeling of making a difference has long since departed. At the end of it all, it's us, the public who will be left worse off when we split the police in to civil and military authorities, when every officer is a solicitor rather than a person.",null,0,null,1432167932,null,0,1432169061,0,crftz40,null,t3_36oo38,null,t1_crftz40,null,t1_crfsqhn,null,null,null,1433179215,null,33,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,33,null

It's not about FIFA you mug, it's about the system Liverpool play! 

We have been most dangerous going forward playing with high pressure, with speedy forwards pressing the back line constantly. Thats why Sterling with Coutinho/Lallana behind him has been preferred to Lambert and Balotelli. Clearly moving away from the style we played last year was detrimental to the team, that's why Rodgers went back to a version of it.

The difference is that they brought in a few world class ones to at least mask it up. 

Yes they made a mistake last season by bringing in Balotelli, but they wanted Remy but for some reason the club decided against signing him. The failed medical was just an excuse for something else.

There are plenty of comments supporting the 'muslims are taking over our country' sentiment here. I don't see how you think differing opinions aren't tolerated here. UK politics tends to be dominated by right wing views as much as this sub tends to the left.

&gt;These kids have warped views because schools have far more Muslims than the country does, proportionally.

I don't think that explains this. There have been plenty of surveys that show the fear of immigrants is highest in areas with least immigrants, and I imagine Islamophobia follows the same pattern. At least personally, I went to a school in London with no majority ethnic/religious group and Muslims probably being the largest religious minority and there was almost zero islamophobia. It's only since living outside of London that I've encountered it.

I don't think Rodgers has as great a relationship as he used to with FSG, so I doubt he'll get full power. Which leads me to think they're strongly considering giving him the sack as well. For example, committee is fired/revamped along with Rodgers, Klopp comes in and controls signings, then a new committee/Director of Football is installed for the next window? 

I always felt FSG would run us like an american sports team. The GM would run the football operations, or in football's case, a DoF. Then they would liase with the CEO/Chairman on manager hirings, coaches, scouts etc. But once a manager is appointed they work closely with the DoF on most of those issues. What's essential is that the DoF and a philosophy is in place BEFORE the manager. Look how Swansea have did it with their style and appointments of Sousa, Martinez, Rodgers.

Now I understand you only have half a day, and will therefore likely only stay in the dockyard.  The ones worth visiting in the dockyard are HMS Warrior, HMS Victory, The Mary Rose museum and Action Stations!  Entrance to each of these is roughly £20 per adult. So the all access can save you some cash.

Action Stations is the shit, it has climbing walls and helicopter sims, and is great with kids.

Yet you assume that just cause people are Asian we can tell what others are up to. Or the fact that someone in charge of a multicultural centre would know what particular crimes people were getting up to. She's not Nancy Drew.

It's not a defensive shell. It's sanity and logic.

It's simple. How many of Harold Shipman's friends knew he was a Serial Kiler. The point is that if your friends don't even know you are a criminal then how do you expect random strangers.

It is the most watched league, TV rights are huge, etc. Naturally that's going to result in a a flow on effect which is the fact that wages are now higher. I think that explains the issue of why we pay more than other clubs.

Then there's the issue of ""well sure we pay more, but why aren't we better?"". A couple of reasons for this. Clubs like Sevilla are happy to finish 4th. They will realistically never compete with the top 3, the clubs beneath them are hardly a threat in the same way Liverpool and Southampton are to us and that gives them the chance to go all out in the Europa League. English clubs don't perform in European Competitions because they can't take it easy and only win 4-1 against Zargoza on the weekend with half their youth squad starting. Then the quality of young players is also an issue. Spain and other European countries have better youth prospects than England. Look at the national teams' success over the last 15 years. Not only that, but when a youngster is in the championship already earning 10k a week and City, Chelsea, Arsenal and all the rest are going after him, how can we pay him anything but 30-40k?

Next season will be even harder. Man u and arsenal will be stronger. City most likely won't be terrible again. We have to improve our squad more than man u or arsenal and hope no one catches up from behind. Or hope that we perform amazing and someone else performs terrible. We have less money than the current top 4 and are less attractive for players in comparison too. They will be further strengthening while we are potentially losing one of our best players before this season even ends. 

This was a crucial season where we had a chance to kick man u while they were down and solidify that we were a club that could get CL while man u were not and slowly reduce their revenue. We failed. We spent a large amount last season and we seem to have to spend a bunch this season too. 

We can't outspend man u/arsenal. The fans want established players but we can't really compete for those players. We have to somehow improve our squad more than those clubs with less money spent. We have to take risks and possibly go for broke now. Or be left trailing being the larger clubs for the next few years. 

Sorry for being so depressing but this is likely the reality. We can only hope that next season, man u/arsenal/city will flop and we can capitalise on the chance. This praying approach will not last forever and we need a better plan on how we can have a better squad than the bigger clubs, with less money spent, if we want to see the title won this decade

Keep pointing to whataboutisms and making excuses, your analogies are as flawed as your logic.

As for the strawman about holding the entire Pakistani community responsible, at no stage did I say that. The perpetrators are responsible, but a degree of culpability lies with the people who ignored their crimes; that includes members of the Pakistani community who knew (we can only speculate on their numbers, but there is clear evidence people knew), social services, police and local politicians.

AGMGTW set us up for some seriously deep emotional story telling with real consequences for the characters. We found out that River was Amy and Rory's daughter and baby river was immediately stolen away. We had these bits of what seemed to be a super interesting story; River regenerating as a little girl decades before Amy and Rory would be born, her mysterious imprisonment, the Doctor's apparent death, the use of the astronaut suit, the mysterious Silence, the Doctor's new quest to save young River from a newly introduced villain.... 


Then, we had to wait the entire summer for Let's Kill Hitler. The name sounded interesting and it seemed clear that a lot of these loose threads would have to factor into it pretty heavily. 

Instead... we got a mostly nonsensical episode with no reason to be in the setting, a terribly contrived new character of Mels was shoved in to resolve the issue of River's childhood but didn't fit with **ANYTHING** in the story before or after. Amy and Rory somehow immediately moved on after being told they could never have biological children and it was now fixed that they could never raise their daughter. The Doctor completely and utterly failed to save River and this was barely even mentioned despite being a huge part of set up at the end of AGMGTW.... 

Its not that it was a terrible episode as a singular episode it was that this was the episode that made it clear that Doctor Who had no aspirations of following through with its mysteries or emotional arcs in a satisfactory way and that it is sometimes more about hyping fans so they give viewership numbers with hints of than actually delivering on those hints.

At the least that would allow you to convert your money in larger lumps, hence perhaps saving fees. Alternatively, if these are very longterm savings (i.e. towards a pension) then keeping them in a foreign currency (or in Japanese stocks or bonds) is a hedge against sterling.

I think it's potentially clumsy to be converting your money in dribs and drabs, but I'm also concerned regarding the certainty of your plans to return to the UK. None of us can be sure what awaits us past 5 years in the future - what if you meet a local girl or guy, or are offered a job in NZ, Aus or USA?

I think this money should be in stocks &amp; bonds, developing returns (hopefully) as part of your very longterm strategy.

* Adding X, Y and Z gives us A.  
  
* If A is negative then this plan will cost us more money than we would otherwise gain and as the current government's plan is cuts in order to save money this undercuts their principle economic objective.  
* If OTOH A is positive then our economy could stand to benefit, so we should look into the detail further, challenge the premises upon which the costs are based and so on.  
  
The chief problem with all of this, of course, is that illegal immigration, being illegal, is somewhat under the radar so no-one can give a clear indication of the actual costs and/or benefits. But rather than acknowledge this and explaining that this is the best we have to go on we just get a load of bluster and moral panic which simply reinforces the opinion that it's a knee-jerk reaction to a perceived problem that's been blown out of proportion.

null,false,premature_eulogy,swans2002,,null,"Lots of replies here from the USA - I feel like I should offer a rather different story. I'm from Finland. Why would a Finn support a relatively small Welsh club?

Basically, my childhood club was [Tampere United](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampere_United). This was mainly thanks to my father, who lived in the city (it's also where I was born) and knew some of the founders. The club went down in 2011 due to the owners being suspected of money laundering and match fixing. Its supporters' trust resurrected the club in the form of [TamU-K](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TamU-K) (short for Tampere Unitedin Kannattajat, literally Supporters of Tampere United). The club plays in the fifth division of Finnish football (for what it's worth, Finnish football is not known for its high quality at any level), but since I no longer live in the city of Tampere, it's hard to follow the matches which are amateur-level at this point. Thankfully the club livestreams some of their matches, so I get a chance to watch them at least sometimes.

But as my first real football club died, I thought I might as well get more into foreign football leagues. I had a look at the Premier League teams, and Swansea City caught my eye for reasons that seem extremely odd in hindsight:

* A Welsh club in the English league is interesting and unique. I've always been fond of things that stand out, possibly because Finland is very odd too.

* The team seemed to have a lot of potential. 

* Dat crest

* The history of the club is a true fairytale and I find it quite relatable - except that my club did not survive its downfall the way Swansea did.

* I did not want to support a top-tier club, as I feel like it leads to a scenario where anything but a win is a disappointment. I'd rather be glad to have a draw after a very solid performance against some rich clubs.

And the rest is history. God, this club is amazing.",null,0,null,1432192461,null,0,1432192692,0,crg4p2x,null,t3_36nmum,null,t1_crg4p2x,null,t3_36nmum,null,null,null,1433184406,null,3,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,3,null

Most tech industries seem to be in large town/small cities at the moment. I know obviously IT is a job that's required everywhere but still.

Milton Keynes. Cambridge and Reading are all heavily tech orientated. Most of the big beasts are in Reading area (IBM, Oracle etc) Cambridge has lots of start ups and I've been hearing talk about the south Wales area too.

However if you want to live in a proper city, london, Birmingham, Glasgow manchester, etc then you'll still be able to find work. Or slightly smaller ones like Leeds, bristol, brighton, Newcastle or Edinburgh. All will have firms in need of IT professionals

I don't know enough about the IT profession to know what particular skills are required where.

Usually full time positions are offered on a salaried basis. Rough ball park of say 30k will get you enough to live comfortably in any of those places except possibly London. But wages are higher in London to compensate. Don't think for a minute you will be better off though. London will suck money out of you faster than a nasty divorce.

The government takes tax and national insurance (income tax 2) out of your wage. There are lots of sites out there like [the salary calculator](http://thesalarycalculator.co.uk/) that can tell you roughly what your take home is. There will be pension too but that's not a great deal.

Thank you! **THIS** is the sort of information I was looking for! After reading this I think I should read up on and look at Reading area

&gt;Rough ball park of say 30k will get you enough to live comfortably in any of those places except possibly London

Ah great, so would a minimum of 50k be required to live in London? Is there a big difference in the cost of living? I understand that there are always more opportunities in the capital but I wonder if living there would leave me with any savings and if there are comparable cities I should look at which are cheaper to live in.

&gt; London will suck money out of you faster than a nasty divorce.

Eeeep....

&gt;There are lots of sites out there like the salary calculator[1] that can tell you roughly what your take home is.

Thanks! That calculator is telling me that I should expect around 31% tax rate which is only slightly more than what I am taxed at in Australia

&gt; There will be pension too but that's not a great deal.

So I've read up on how the pension works over there but I was wondering if a quoted salary includes compulsory pension?

In Australia it's simple:

* If you're paid $1000 as your base salary you employer must chip in a further 9.5% (so $95 in this scenario)
* The money in super is taxed at 15% ($70.75 is left)

If you are an employer and you unknowingly hire somebody who is not supposed to be in the UK, you can receive very large fines.  These are enforced (although of course there are probably many cases where they get away with it).

It's not just that if the employer doesn't check, or turns a blind eye they will be fined - they will be fined under strict liability.  That is to say, even if the employer checked and was fooled by fake documents.  There have been cases where employers have been heavily fined, because they have hired people with what appeared to be British passports - but it later turned out (after police/immigration raids) that the passports were extremely good forgeries.

Over and above this, requiring employers to check the immigration status of employees opens up many problems for the employer.  Of course, the employer will ask for everyone's documents, but if they don't employ (or put extra scrutiny on) somebody who appears to have the right documents but in someway appears potentially suspicious to them - they will likely be accused of racism - and that too exposes them to fines.

One thing I've never understood is why the government policy is that each drug needs to be categorised individually, and then banned. Many other countries have rules where if something is chemically derivative from a banned substance, it's automatically illegal.

As an example, Methylphenidate (Ritalin) has been a controlled substance in the UK since 1971, but 5 closely related chemicals are only on a temporary banning order that came into force [in March](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/apr/09/government-advised-ban-substance-adhd-drug-ritalin-ethylphenidate).

Over here I typically work extra hours during peak periods (especially on nights where I need to do a deployment outside of business hours) and less hours during slow periods

Also we enjoy a quick walk to the coffee shop in the morning here and catchup on the weekend or w/e during the walk to and from.

The tube and rail network are very very extensive and cover pretty much everywhere. You will have a prepaid oyster card which you just swipe in and out of public transport and it automatically calculates the cost.

Accommodation wise the closer you are to a tube station the more expensive it will be.

Busses the cheapest option as they have a flat rate fare. Not sure what it is as I don't travel by bus much.

You can get travel cards which reduce the cost of commuting but I only ever visit London so I don't know about them. A Londoner will be able to tell you or look on the transport for London website. (Tfl for short)

If you just use the underground your spend is capped at £6.40 I think. After you've spent that much it stops charging you for the day if you're using an oyster. Which you will be.

null,false,kopking08,null,null,null,"Judging a manager on what he did with no money and with money is quite different. Also the expectations. At Liverpool you can sign someone for roughly the same amount of your transfer budget (say 7 whatever for Alberto is more 1 million for Reading) and have it considered a massive flop versus something most Reading fans wouldn't bat an eyelash at.

I don't disagree with most people who would say that Rodgers (or THE Committee) has been dodgy on transfers since his time at Liverpool. If not just the players bought, but the positions prioritized (last summer I felt a DM was a signing we needed the most and that turned out to be true - we were at our best this season when Lucas was able to come back and play as a pure DM). 

That said, if anyone wants to go down the line of transfers made by the last handful of Liverpool managers, you'll find the VAST majority of signings were absolutely dreadful. Like, not just so-so players or even players who might come good, but complete and utter flops.

In Rodgers time I'd argue that only Balotelli could be considered a complete flop so far. Borini, someone in that range, was able to attract a transfer fee (although he blocked it) larger than what he was signed for. Aspas sounds like he'll be bought for the price he was bought for. Lovren I think can still become a staple in our back 4, he just needs to be working with a proper DM and wingbacks that are a bit more intelligent and not caught up field as often as Moreno was at the start of the season (he's improved in that regard). Markovic would have probably received more game time this season if we had a stronger striker to feed. Lambert cost nothing. Sahko is class. Allen is, on this sub at least, a fan favorite and despite my criticism of him, probably worth his price tag if only for how long he can be a staple in the match day squad (if not 11). Mignolet is now our player of the season, although we'll need to eventually upgrade him if we want to be a perennial title contender. 

Obviously Coutinho and Sturridge have come good.

But you also need to look to Brendan's record on bringing through young talent. No one realizes how a manager that can pull players up through the ranks is just as important as a manager who can sign players. 

In Rodgers time we've brought so many academy prospects through that could legitimately make it. Try and find an academy player who's come through to really effect the first team at Chelsea, City, or even Arsenal. Wenger gets so much credit, but he has mostly plucks players that already ripened at lower clubs and at 18 make it to Arsenal ready to make strides forward. 

Point being, Rodgers has made or bought players who could arguably be apart of our first 11 for years to come in: Sterling, Ibe, Henderson (he made Hendo, no way around it), Can, Flannagan (Flanno has hit injuries but, even though he was never going to be world class, he could have easily been the stable RB/LB in the vein of a Carragher/Finnan type), Moreno (hasn't set the world alight but there's few out there who could improve on him), Markovic (He will come good), Coutinho, Sturridge, Allen, etc.

The problem is that supporters of one group are forced to be supporters of the other when it comes time to vote.

&gt;The business didn't discriminate against a customer based on their lifestyle

Well, that's actually very open to interpretation:

&gt;Earlier on Friday, Karen McArthur admitted that she had initially agreed to an order for the cake because she did not want to embarrass the customer who asked for it or start a confrontation in the shop. She said she then consulted an elder in her branch of the Presbyterian church about the order. 

&gt;She added: “In my heart I knew that I would not be able to fulfil the order.” 

From an earlier article. She admitted that she took the order, but knew that it wouldn't be fulfilled yet said nothing at the time. Avoiding embarrassment? Sorry, that's just weak.

Nobody comes out of this smelling of roses. The business could have, or should have, just declined to write the slogan. But refusal to make the cake outright because of the owners' conscience and religous beliefs takes this matter to a new level. It's not a matter of ""taste"", as you put it.

&gt;The business didn't discriminate against a customer based on their lifestyle

The court decided otherwise.

You talk about freedom of conscience and expression. Do you not think that Gareth Lee's freedom of expression is also valuable? As far as I'm concerned Lee's freedom of conscience and expression  has been fully upheld. Why is this a problem for you? (Insert ""having cake and eat it"" joke here)

If you're using a letting agent there will be fees. They can range from £50 if you're lucky to £250+ if you're not. Most often they're 'per person' fees too. They're daylight robbery and damn near unjustifiable, but if you want the property you'll need to pay them. 

Then you have council tax. Usually that'll be ~£100 or so per month on a 2 bed flat. That's on a per property basis, not per person. 

Then you have electricity, gas, water, phone and broadband. 

If the flat isn't too shit and old, and has central heating then you're looking at prices of about (per month, for the whole property):

Gas = £30 

Electricity = £30 

Water = £10 - £35 depending on if it's metered or unmetered. 

Phone/Broadband = £35 for a connection you'd want to use

TV license (if you watch live TV only) = ~£12


Then every 6 or 12 months depending on your contract you can expect your letting agent (if you use one) to charge you £25-80 to renew your contract. 

Again, daylight robbery. 

So when looking around flats, ask the letting agents the following:

1) How much is rent per month?

2) How much is the deposit?

3) How much are the fees, and are they per person?

4) How much are contract renewal fees?

&gt; Which areas should I look to work in where there is an abundance of I.T firms and a low cost of living?

In general, areas with a high concentration of I.T. firms are areas with high cost of living. However, realistically you can make decent coin working in I.T., so don't worry about it too much. As a rough rule of thumb, cities get cheaper the further north you go; [this map](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23234033) gives a pretty good indication of how expensive different places are to live. Off the top of my head, London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Reading, Milton Keynes, Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle would all be good places to find an I.T. role. Of these, Glasgow and Newcastle will have the lowest cost of living, and Reading, Milton Keynes, and London will have the highest.

&gt; Would any of you have ballpark estimates of the amount of pay I should be asking for in which regions?

I wouldn't really consider different regions to have different estimates of pay. All you should really need to consider is London or not London. Assuming this will be your first professional job in the field, you should be expecting £22-29k outside of London, and about £27-35k to work in London. This is based on salaries I was quoted when job-hunting last year, your results may vary.

&gt;The recruiter mentioned that certain roles will offer less money but instead give benefits such as car allowance etc. but are these benefits typically worth it?

No, unless the benefit is absolutely crucial to you. Any decent company will offer you benefits on top of your salary, not instead of your salary. A good pension should come as standard, but other answers have covered that pretty well.

&gt;what are some employment/recruitment/salary ""gotcha's"" I should look out for?

I genuinely can't think of any. As long as you're quoted an annual salary (not a daily rate, these are for contractors), then you should be fine.

null,false,the_hunchback,null,null,null,"&gt;Britons are more likely to enter, and then escape, poverty than most other Europeans, according to research by the Office for National Statistics.
The research makes clear that the overall UK poverty rate is slightly below the EU average.

&gt;Almost a third of the British population, more than 19m people, dipped below the poverty line for at least one year at some point between 2010 and 2013.
The figure was higher than the 25 per cent average across the EU as a whole and was only exceeded by Greece and Latvia.
&gt;But the UK also has one of the lowest levels of “persistent poverty” across the EU, in a sign that the chances of getting out of poverty are relatively high.
&gt;“These studies reveal that although some people are stuck in poverty, the majority of ‘the poor’ consist of a constantly changing group of different individuals,” the ONS said.
&gt;“Although this means that poverty persists only for a relatively small minority, with the burden of poverty being shared among a larger section of the population, evidence suggests that those who have already been in poverty are more likely to experience poverty again in the future than those who have never been in poverty.”
&gt;Jonathan Cribb, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank, said the UK’s relatively low rate of unemployment was likely to be an important factor in keeping down persistent poverty.
UK and EU average persistent and overall poverty rates
&gt;“A relatively better employment performance will be an important factor in having relatively low levels of persistent poverty.”
&gt;The flexibility of the labour market was likely to be a factor in the high rates of people entering and leaving poverty, he said.
&gt;“People move between jobs and have a short spell of unemployment, giving them no earned income for a short period of time.”
&gt;The ONS said its findings showed that more people had experienced poverty than the headline poverty indicators would suggest.
&gt;The overall relative income poverty rate stood at 15.9 per cent in 2013. This was slightly below the EU average although it was 13th highest out of the 28 member states.

&gt;Third of Londoners unable to afford basics

&gt;Study shows 43% of those with children are unable to achieve decent standard of living

&gt;The national statistics office said a brief period in poverty was less detrimental than prolonged penury, as people could use short-term strategies such as making use of savings or loans to avoid social exclusion. Persistent poverty was particularly damaging for children, it said.
&gt;Poverty is defined as living in a household with disposable income below 60 per cent of the national median, while persistent poverty is defined as being poor in the current year and at least two of the three preceding years.
&gt;Only the Czech Republic, Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland, Slovakia and Slovenia recorded better results on persistent poverty than the UK.
&gt;In 2013, 7.8 per cent of people in the UK were in persistent income poverty, equivalent to approximately 4.6m people.
&gt;Pensioners and those living in single-parent households were more likely than average to fall below the poverty line, the ONS said.

Yet, instead of working to improve the conditions and image of the career, the government is actively trying to make it worse, by doing things like this, and by trying to reduce the pay that GP trainees receive during their training.  


When I teach medical students, hardly any of them say they want to be a GP.  It used to be that way, but not any more.  They all want to work in hospitals as physicians, surgeons, diagnostic specialists, etc, because they see how much every single government messes with GPs, and see how unhappy most of the GPs they meet are.  In the next five years we are going to see a lot of early retirements of existing senior GPs who are in the position to say ""I don't want to see patients at the weekend, sod this, I'm going to retire"".  Many will decide to become a locum, where nobody can force you to work days you don't want to work.  Many will move to another country like Canada, Australia or New Zealand, where agencies exist which will find you a job, arrange a house, car, and all of your posessions to be shipped across with a minimum of inconvenience, and when you work there it's with significantly better pay and conditions.  


What I expect to see is a crisis in GP recruitment, and there will have to be a reassessment of employment conditions in order to solve it.  If you were a medical student about to qualify this August, would you set your sights on a career in GP at the moment?

The thing is that when you take a single issue on its own there are of course solutions, but the combined picture is one where there are many flaws.

What I'm telling you is that this literature *persistently* fails to engage with any of the criticism from people who actually deal with economics on a day-to-day basis (not always, but often). Whether these economists are right or wrong, they are the people you need to convince because they are the people who make decisions about how to allocate money - the mere fact they have criticisms should warrant a serious and considered response to them. I'm not picking on you - because a lot of people do it - but dismissing a question about supply and demand in a system with no price controls as 'a patronising retelling of the capitalist narrative' makes it seem as though you don't understand what function prices serve in the current market, which makes me seriously doubt your credibility when it comes to telling me that another economic system is superior.

So quick questions - what role do mainstream economist believe prices play in the current system (with respect to supply and demand)? What do economists think explains pricing in the labour market? I'm not looking for an answer like 'Oppress the poor' even if you think that's what prices do in practice - I want a nice, short, 101-level description of what economists like me think prices do in a simple market.

As for changing banks, IIRC TSB offer 4% or 5% interest on their main current account (up to £2,500 or £5,000, it's hard to keep up).

Other popular alternatives are Santander 123 (3% up to £20,000 &amp; a credit card with good cashback), Nationwide (5% up to £2,500), and various others.

&gt;Definition
&gt;Relative income poverty is measured here by the poverty rate and the poverty gap. The poverty rate is the ratio of the number of people whose income falls below the poverty line and the total population; the poverty line is here taken as half the median household income. However, two countries with the same poverty rates may differ in terms of the relative income-level of the poor. To measure this dimension, the poverty gap, i.e. the percentage by which the mean income of the poor falls below the poverty line, is also presented.

&gt;Income is defined as household disposable income in a particular year. It consists of earnings, self-employment and capital income and public cash transfers; income taxes and social security contributions paid by households are deducted. The income of the household is attributed to each of its members, with an adjustment to reflect differences in needs for households of different sizes (i.e. the needs of a household composed of four people are assumed to be twice as large as those of a person living alone).

Assume 0% inflation in everything  for one year. If those above the *relative* poverty line were to gain significantly, then the *relative poverty line* would actually move up meaning that more people were in poverty! Those below the line haven't got poorer, it's just that median has moved. People who were above the line, can now be classified as below it simply by the fact that those better off (and they could only be slightly) have got better off (again it could only be slightly).

This is the problem of using **relative** vs. absolute poverty. There are those who seek to use this confusion for their own political ends.

Yes there are problems needing to be tackled but by conflagration, those in absolute poverty with those just below relative poverty line, does a great disservice to the former.",null,0,null,1432204609,null,0,false,0,crg7frd,null,t3_36qha7,null,t1_crg7frd,null,t3_36qha7,null,null,null,1433185698,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

Yep that's right. So a 5% contribution from me, would be an 8% contribution from the employer. And can be done via salary sacrifice to reduce cost on NIC/income tax.

It is a great deal, I think I just need to better understand what happens when I move out of the UK in terms of my pension, and how I will go about receiving it if I'm no longer a resident here.

&gt;As for changing banks, IIRC TSB offer 4% or 5% interest on their main current account (up to £2,500 or £5,000, it's hard to keep up).

This is correct, they offer 5% up to £2,000, but I need to go in to a branch this weekend and ask them about it in person. When I try and open it online it requires me to open an entirely different account rather than link it to my current bank account I have with them.

&gt;As for property savings, look into the Help to Buy ISA, which receives tax relief from the government in addition to any interest. This will open in the Autumn and will require you to have made no Cash ISA contributions in the current year.

Whatever the source of the quote, I think their point was that people who view their British identity as intrinsically involving Scotland have the problem that many people in Scotland don't feel the same way.

That leads to the kind of ""destroying my country"" perception that you frequently see here on or /r/ukpolitics, where person A feels ""my country"" is the UK while person B feels ""my country"" is Scotland.

Person A feels that Scotland is intrinsically as much a part of the UK as Yorkshire is, person B feels that the UK is something that Scotland currently participates in (just as the UK does the EU) but there's nothing that requires that state of affairs to last forever.

&gt; “I don’t think there was ever anyone at Liverpool using the word Moneyball, but plenty of other people were using it. I think the reality is there were two phases to what’s happened since the change of ownership. In the first phase, like any major transaction of that type, we talked about the knowledge of soccer, and that takes time. So we probably spent a year with the owners taking a leap of faith to a certain degree of other people telling them what they should be doing. Within that year we then get to a situation where the dust has settled, and people start to see what is and isn’t working.

&gt; “I think the fundamental shift particularly around player acquisitions and disposals was that we took the view that it needs to be more of a science. Your biggest expenditure line can’t be the whim of any individual. What we believe, and we continue to follow, is you need many people involved in the process. That doesn’t mean somebody else is picking the team for Brendan [Rodgers, the manager]. But Brendan needs to set out with his team of people which positions we want to fill and what the key targets would be for that.

&gt; “He has a team of people that go out and do an inordinate amount of analysis work to establish who are the best players in that position. It’s a combination of things. **Despite what people think and read, it’s not a whole bunch of guys sitting behind a computer working out who we should buy. It’s a combination of old-school scouting and watching players — and that’s Brendan, his assistants, our scouts — with statistical analysis of players across Europe and the rest of the world. By bringing those two processes together, you get a much more educated view of who you should and shouldn’t be buying. And perhaps as fundamentally, how much you should be paying and the structure to those contracts.**”

Unless you envisage an authoritarian version of socialism, that would clearly be a possibility.  Some socialists would argue that, because the capitalist organisation of production is inherently oppressive and authoritarian, it should be legislated against on that basis.  Contracts for slavery are currently void, for example.  Personally, I'd prefer to configure the seas in which socialist organisations swim in a way less disadvantageous to them so as to make such a decision patently illogical.  Under the present system, reversion back to capitalism would likely occur because of how tilted the economic system is against cooperative enterprises (access to capital, the crushing power available to larger, globalised businesses, etc.).  If capitalist businesses had to compete on a level playing field with socialist ones, they wouldn't do anywhere near so well, leaving aside the question of whether competition or cooperation produces the best outcomes (and modern game theory generally suggests the latter).",null,0,null,1432206056,null,0,false,0,crg7sku,null,t3_365ath,null,t1_crg7sku,null,t1_crg63wb,null,null,null,1433185865,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I understand that all these clubs are in the elite, but you don't get too many world class managers working at shit clubs.

Also you're acting like you've never heard a player say something along the lines of ""I've always wanted to work under _____"" 

Liverpool, at the moment, offer nothing to good players. Having a manager who is unknown to the rest of Europe makes things even worse. If we had someone like Klopp, I imagine players would have more confidence that we will rise again in the near future. Klopp did it at Dortmund, why not Liverpool as well? Rodgers has achieved nothing so far in his young career. Yeah, we finished second, but after this season's performance and with the players we are losing it's going to look like a one off thing.

Obviously, there are bigger variables that will affect a player's decision (like money), but this conversation is about manager reputations which I think helps in a small way. Which is better than nothing (which is the case with BR).

Lets talk about how stupid it is!

&gt;You’ll regret not having a Human Rights Act when a left-wing government returns.

Because, as we all know, left wing governments don't respect human rights. That's why the last time we had a left wing government, they introduced the Human Rights Act. The flipside of this, of course, is that right wing governments *always* respect human rights, which is why the second this government was elected, they started talking about repealing human rights legislation!

Huh. Does that paragraph read a bit strangely to you? Could it be that no ideology has a monopoly on human rights and that the very idea that one ideology does have a monopoly on what is supposedly a universal concept is completely incompatible with the notion itself?

I fully recognise that left wing governments are just as likely to violate human rights as right wing governments. I like to think that if the situation were reversed and Labour were trying to repeal Human Rights legislation introduced by the Tories, I would have the intellectual honesty not to pretend that the main problem with this was that the Tories were likely to be re-elected one day.

&gt;British judges are surely more reliable guardians of liberty than the jurists in Strasbourg.

Why?

&gt;The fact that the Conservatives have said in their manifesto that they’d like to repeal **Labour’s Human Rights Act** doesn’t mean the present government will try to disapply the European Convention [*my epmhasis*].

How does this square with the headline? It takes some balls to remind us that it was a left wing government that passed the HRA while at the same time claiming that the HRA is necessary to protect us from left wing governments.

&gt;Nor is anyone suggesting that the European Court should be completely disregarded. Rather, if the judges in Strasbourg rule that a particular British law is incompatible with the Convention, that would be treated as advisory rather than binding under the new proposal. Whether to amend or repeal the law in question would be a matter for Parliament.

Firstly, some people very much are 'suggesting that the European Court should be completely disregarded'. Maybe they're not on the Conservative front bench, but they're definitely out there. Secondly, what Young is describing here is identical to the current scenario: Parliament remains the highest authority on what laws should be passed and all ECHR judgments are indeed advisory. I can't even tell what Young's trying to defend at the moment. He sounds like he's trying to defend this British Bill of Rights but in fact he's using an argument that defends the HRA.

&gt;Like many conservatives, I think it’s absurd when a non-British convicted murderer, on his release from prison, cannot be deported by the Home Office because Strasbourg has ruled that sending him back to his country of origin would violate his right to a family life.

Woo! Strawman! Because no left wing people think that's absurd? It's telling that Young doesn't provide a source for this foreign murderer story. I expect that's because there isn't one.

But is it really so absurd to expect someone to be convicted of a crime, do jail time, then stop being punished? It seems to me that there's a fairly important legal principle embedded in there somewhere.

&gt;I’m sure Michael Gove, the Justice Secretary, will do his best to secure a measure of cross-party support for the Bill.

Yes, because Michael Gove is well-known for his tendency to seek broad consensus for his reforms. That's why he was censured by every single teaching union during his time as Education Secretary and removed from the role because he had become so divisive it was costing the party votes (I suspect these weren't only the votes of teachers).

&gt;Take Protocol 1, Article 2, for instance, which talks about the right of parents to educate children in accordance with their own religious beliefs. At present, that clause gives some protection to faith schools and a Labour government that sought to abolish them could be challenged in Strasbourg.

Is there any indication at all that Labour might do this?

&gt;Alternatively, a future Labour government might simply decide to repeal the Conservative’s Bill of Rights and disregard the Convention altogether, something that would give it a much free-er hand when it came to enacting hard left legislation.

*Gasp!* You mean like what the Tories are doing now?! Let me go and find some pearls to clutch!

&gt;In that scenario, there’d be nothing to prevent a despotic Labour government riding roughshod over the whole panoply of human rights, including the right to free speech.

Again, it's the party that introduced the HRA we have to worry about not the one that wants to repeal it. Come on. Lets try that sentence again, with one slight edit:

&gt;In that scenario, there’d be nothing to prevent a despotic ~~Labour~~ government riding roughshod over the whole panoply of human rights, including the right to free speech.

See how easy it is to make your arguments make sense, Toby?

&gt;For me, a bigger worry is that a country that is currently signed up to the Convention, such as Russia, would cite the British government’s repeal of the Human Rights Act as an excuse to remove itself from the jurisdiction of the European Court.

Why are Toby's biggest worries all about something else or somewhere else? My biggest worry about the Tories repealing human rights legislation is that *they're fucking repealing human rights legislation*. According to Toby, they're only doing this because of their fundamental respect for human rights, and the only reason we should be worried is that Labour and Russia don't have the same respect for human rights. This may be the stupidest thing I've ever read.

&gt;There’s another risk, too, which is that repealing the Human Rights Act could precipitate a constitutional crisis. As things stand, it is embedded in devolution legislation as well as the Good Friday Agreement and Nicola Sturgeon has already condemned the Conservative proposals as ‘appalling’. This looks like exactly the sort of thing that would provide her with an excuse to start agitating for a second referendum, although she’ll probably manufacture an excuse whatever the government does.

Finally, an argument that makes sense. Of course, it's viewed through the Toby Young Insane-o-scope, so apparently it's Nicola Sturgeon's fault that the government breaking the law might piss of Scotland. Let's try another slight edit:

&gt;This looks like exactly the sort of thing that would provide her with ~~an excuse~~ *a completely valid reason* to start agitating for a second referendum.

Much better.

&gt;The present arrangement, whereby the will of Parliament can be thwarted by Strasbourg, is far from perfect. 

And now we get to the straightforward lie. As I mentioned earlier, Young actually already described the current situation while absurdly pretending that he wasn't. Here it is again, this time with my trademark sarcastic edits:

&gt;If the judges in Strasbourg rule that a particular British law is incompatible with the Convention, that ~~would be~~ *is* treated as advisory rather than binding ~~under the new proposal~~.

It's quite generous of Young to make sure we have no reason to give him the benefit of the doubt by ending his article with an outright lie. Maybe we could have vaguely nodded through his imprecations agaisnt Labour and his argument that a famously divisive non-lawyer might be the right person to write divisive, complex human rights legislation. Maybe he even could have written a different article, that was still partisan, but wherein he pointed out to Tory-HRA-haters that the HRA protects them, too -- at points it seems like this might be what he meant.

But no! He makes it very, very clear that he has not a single fucking clue what he is talking about and absolutely no intention of formulating remotely sensible arguments by simply writing total bollocks in the final paragraph.

The opposite of this also applies, sometimes a road has a speed limit on it, and it wouldnt be significantly more dangerous to be travelling 10, or 20 MPH over the legal speed limit. 

I know of plenty of dual carriageways where there are 40 or 50 MPH limits, and the road could well be a 70MPH just like any other DC.

Its also worth noting that the 70MPH speed limit wasnt set because it is some kind of sacred speed. 75MPH isnt automatically unsafe. Neither is 80MPH.

So let's look at the facts.

Only[ 6.8%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18623096) of the UK's land is classified as urban. Once you take into account green areas like parks, the amount of land actually ""built on"" is 2.27%. The idea of population growth changing Britain's landscape in any significant way (into an ""urban jungle"") is not based in reality. Even with double our current population, Britain would still be overwhelmingly rural in land use. 

The UK's population grew by around [400,000](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pop-estimate/population-estimates-for-uk--england-and-wales--scotland-and-northern-ireland/2013/sty-population-changes.html) people in 2013, of which around half was due to migration. If we assume that rate stays steady, how crowded will Britain get? It certainly sounds like a lot of people.

At that rate of population growth, it will take the UK 44 years to reach a population of 82,120,931 in 2059, at which point the UK will have the same population density as present-day Japan, at 337.1/km^2. 

That puts things into perspective. People in Japan enjoy a high quality of life, and the country is full of huge swathes of rural land and areas natural beauty in addition to large cities. That level of population density is hardly the end of the world. Many would in fact consider it desirable. More people, bigger economy, more global influence.

Assuming the same area of land use per person, urban land use would increase from 6.8% to 8.7% with a population of 82,120,931. Still not anything close to an urban jungle. And with likely greater use of high-rise buildings, the land use per person would likely go down, so the percentage would probably be lower (as it is in Japan).

Of course the distribution of those people in the UK will be uneven, most likely centred around London, Birmingham and Manchester. But this does little to displace the comparison with Japan, since Japan also has very uneven population distribution. Compare the northern island of Japan, Hokkaido, and Scotland:

Scottish population: 5,327,700

Scottish land area: 78,387 km2

Hokkaido population: 5,507,456

Hokkaido land area: 83,453 km2

Japan is just as full of large, empty spaces as the UK is. 

But what about the infrastructure point? Surely the UK's infrastructure can't keep up? This is simply not the case. 

Examples of people having to wait to use services etc. are not historically unusual. It's got very little to do with migration or population growth, and everything to do with budgets. As migrants contribute to budgets via taxation as well as use services, they do not contribute to budgetary strain. EU migrants are a net benefit to the treasury: EU immigrants made a [net contribution of £20bn](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1114/051114-economic-impact-EU-immigration) to UK public finances between 2000 and 2011.

But what about the speed of change? Maybe if immigration is fast enough, it doesn't matter that they more than pay their way, simply because it takes time to build stuff?

This does not stand up to historical analysis. The UK's population growth of 400,000 a year is historically unremarkable, amounting to a 0.6% annual growth. In 1971 the UK had a population of 55,928,000, and grew to 64,511,000 today, a growth of 15% in 44 years. If population growth remains at the current rate and we grow to 82,120,931 over the next 44 years, that will be a growth of 27%. It's not hugely faster, and when you consider other historical periods it becomes even less remarkable: the population grew from 38 million in 1901 to 46 million in 1931, or 32% in 30 years.

Britain's infrastructure will be no more or less strained by the population than it has been historically. And in fact, economic performance is the real determining factor of infrastructure burden, not population growth.

People generally overestimate how long it takes to build things, and how expensive they are. Take as an example Norfolk on Norwich University Hospital, which serves the entire city of Norwich and a large amount of the surrounding area. It took 3.5 years to build at cost £229 million. Building can obviously keep up, and we have the money: compare the extra £20bn of tax revenues from migrants over a 10 year period to the £229 million to build a hospital. The UK could have built 87 new hospitals between 2001 and 2011 from the extra tax revenues from migrants alone.

The real issue at the moment is housing, but that's a political issue. Everyone knows the solution, which is building more houses. It doesn't have to be a problem, it's simply political forces are keeping it a problem.",null,0,null,1432206958,null,0,false,0,crg816p,null,t3_36qhad,null,t1_crg816p,null,t3_36qhad,null,null,null,1433185978,null,74,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,74,null

A tit for tat war, no matter how brutal and heinous, is not the same as a war of aggression designed to bring about a caliphate. In this particular example it would appear according to your own links that this was an aggression started by an Islamist group, who then comprehensively got their arses handed to them, and were forced to retreat north. Where they STILL continue to persecute Christians where they can. Hardly similar to a state defending its existence against an external force like ISIS. Poor effort.

Rape has always been used as a weapon of war, by soldiers of all religions. And that is a disgusting fact of human nature. But funnily enough Rotherham was not at war when 1400 young girls were being raped by Islamic gangs. So as an example its pretty piss poor.

Well this is closer to the mark in that at least it relates to peacetime offending, but it still doesn't really apply. The reason why Islam has been singled out at Rotherham isn't just that a large number of sexual offenses occurred, as here, it was because it was very clearly being perpetrated by one homogeneous ethnic and religious grouping of men, against another largely homogeneous group of victims. It was sexual violence on racial and religious lines, Asian (almost exclusively Pakistani Muslim) on white crime. 
It tied into, to use your own theme, the Muslim cultural belief that ""All white women are whores"".

Thing is, its not just a ""narrative"", it exists, its a pervasive reality. And if you don't believe that it exists my advice is to learn Arabic, or Turkish, or Urdu, and go spend some time in a Muslim country. Its astonishing what Muslim men will say about white women when they don't realize that she speaks the language.

null,false,mrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrmmm,null,null,null,"&gt; The business didn't discriminate against a customer based on their lifestyle. That's something that was already clearly illegal, rightly or wrongly. They discriminated against an order.

Where do you draw the line?  If I sell personalized birthday cakes, should I be able to refuse to make a ""Happy Birthday Mohammed"" cake on the basis that most people called Mohammed are Muslims?  If I sell custom wedding cakes, should I be able to refuse to make ones with same-sex toppers, or interracial toppers?  Sometimes the details of an order are closely related to the customer's protected characteristic(s), as in this case.

&gt; Just because they make custom cakes, it doesn't mean there's some duty for them to fulfil whatever a customer can imagine.

Nobody is suggesting that there is.  They do have a duty to follow equality law, though.  They could probably even get around this ruling by introducing a neutral policy such as ""no messages about marriage"" or ""no political messages"".

&gt; Imagine custom chair makers refusing to make a three legged chair. There's no mental gymnastics in what I'm saying, though it's a different way of getting it in perspective, because the principle is no different.

How is that in any way analogous?

You state so many personal views as if they are facts, but to list a few problems:

- Reducing tax specifically makes you richer and a reduction of public spending has limited effect on the cost of living. Surveys by the ONS show the British Public to be the happiest with public services in a decade -  http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/bsa-survey-2014. I am not sure why you have linked these two, especially when the public services were so inefficient most of the savings have been ""efficiency"" anyway (although the next 3 years they won't be unfortunately)

- Increased public spending resulting in increased debt repayments would ultimately lead to reduced public services anyway, so even if you are correct it doesn't benefit those you purport to represent. There is nothing progressive about spending so much on debt

- Food banks are a controversial topic and definitely something that needs looking at. However just because people take free stuff doesnt mean they need it

- You are right that the conservatives have a more laissez-faire approach to the economy than Labour, however this does not mean they 'ignore the social consequences of inequality,' let alone want to drive it like you suggest

- Thatcher did indeed set in place the de-regulation of the city that some what contributed to the 2008 crisis. However the deregulation was furthered under New Labour to a point way beyond what Thatcher ever took it to. It is convenient you forgot to mention the 12 years of Labour rule and deregulation up to the crash in your anti-Tory rant. Don't see how something both parties partook in can be blamed on the Tories

- The conservatives want to help the poor as much as Labour just with different approaches. Labours is to throw money at them with benefits whilst demonising success. Tories instead want to emulate the success by bringing the poor up and not punishing them for working like Labour did who overtaxed them alongside creating an incredibly generous benefits system that deterred work

- Stiglitz is an incredible economist but does not provide any reason why Labour are preferable to the Tories. You have stated (through personal belief) that Tories love inequality then linked to an economist who says it is bad (which the Tories agree with too anyway?). Not sure what this proves, no one here is stating they want inequality to rise apart from yourself in regards to the Tories

- Your class warfare on the Tories is astonishing. Ed Milliband is a career politician like Cameron and studied PPE at Oxford too before going straight into the Civil Service. So did Harriett Harman (she even went to same primary school as Osbourne). Oh wait, Ed Balls ALSO studied PPE at Oxford (how could you not realise this?). Regarding their economic competence - Ed Balls over saw disastrous economic policy that saw the highest budget deficit of any OECD country in the run up to 2008 worsening the crisis. The fact you ignore this simply because he studied economics is hilarious. Regarding Ed Milliband - loads of people study economics and even lecture it (Karl Marx to take an extreme) and it gives no indication of their ability to run a country economically. Heck I studied it, does that make me an economist?

Meanwhile George Osbourne has precided over a booming economy that has created more jobs than all of Europe combined and is receiving world wide praise from economists (including Krugman) and large bodies such as the IMF. The fact you discount all this because he ""studied History"" is beyond me. He is way more qualified with years of experience.

Your post was incredibly civil and you have written it with an air of authority but which exhumes the same points per the link I posted. To sum up your post:

- Tories hate the poor and anyone who votes them does too
- Tories and their voters want inequality to run rampant so they can profit
- Tories are all old posh boys unlike my mates at Labour who went to exactly the same university and studied exactly the same courses
- Heres a link to some of the few economists who agree with me (I have conveniently forgot to include any, even more respected ones, who disagree)
- Its all Thatchers fault despite being in government 3 decades before the crash. In fact it is so much her fault that the Labour government of the 12 years up to the crash have no blame at all

The judge actually compared it to a straight person asking for a ""support straight marriage"" cake, which the bakery would apparently have been OK with.  The test is a bit more complex than that, though.  You don't necessarily have to deny service to people because they have (or you think they have) a particular protected characteristic, you just need to treat them less favourably.  There is also ""indirect"" discrimination, which covers facially neutral rules that disproportionately harm particular groups of people (for example, banning people wearing head coverings from your shop would cause problems for various faith groups).  And then there are lots of exceptions allowing particular kinds of organizations to engage in particular forms of discrimination.
