You *can* deny, but unfortunately you cannot convince. The Tories failings are self-evident. 
You cannot make the blanket statement that they are ""dramatically improving the economy"" when they are just flat out arguably not.

But fair cop guv, you can think what you want. This is Reddit so I am not remotely interested in getting into a debate on the issue. Vote for the tories in the election as is your democratic right. I won't, though I did give Cameron the benefit of the doubt before, and I'm more than happy to counter the absurd Thatcher-hate with some reality. 

My opinion isn't borne from some knee-jerk Tory hate but simply from assessing their years of current government. 
They legalized gay marriage, great. That's about the only good thing I've seen come from Cameron's cabinet. From my perspective (and the perspective of many others) in almost every other way they've fallen short.

Yes, it is a fact that somewhere in various enclaves in the UK there will be houses that are affordable. Of course that is true. However, people want (need?) to live near where the jobs are, and particularly for young professionals these are predominantly in the major urban (expensive!) areas.

It's not difficult to understand. In 1980 it was perfectly possible for a young professional to buy a house in major urban areas like London (!), for 4 times their entry level salary. This is next to impossible now.

There's a broad section of society that is very pro-immigration, pro-multiculturalism but they don't have many solutions to unemployment within the immigrant communities. Employers generally are reluctant to hire non-Swedes so you see a lot of very overqualified taxi drivers, hairdressers, etc. A close friend of mine has been in Sweden for two years, her husband is a very experienced carpenter but he has to work in an Italian restaurant. Note: he's the only Italian in the restaurant. The chef is Swedish.

Many Swedes are up in arms about the Charlie Hebdo thing but many people have stood in front of mosques and synagogues to prevent vandalism and arson attacks. These guys are extremely sympathetic to all and sundry.

On the other side you have Jimmy Åkesson's Sweden Democrats, which are the UKIP equivalent. In the recent elections they got something like 13% of the seats, so there is obviously a large anti-immigration contingent. You only need to look at internet commentary boards to see the same ""damn multiculti islamicists"" froth that is prevalent in the UK now as well. There is a definite feeling that the conservatives (small c) and far-right are growing in popularity.

Given the treatment I have received over the last few years I feel sorry for the next wave of Syrians that are going to come to Sweden. Opening the gates to refugees seems a very humanitarian thing to do, and the rest of the world has rightly applauded the decision. My worry is that once they are here the state will simply ignore them. Go to any town now, *any* town, and you will see people sat outside the local supermarket or off licence (Systembolaget) asking for spare change. There is an equivalent to the Big Issue here but so rarely do I see people buying it that I doubt it makes a difference.

In short, the Swedes would like to appear progressive and liberal to the rest of the world, but underneath it all there is still a cynicism and selfishness that shows up a rather nastier truth: we are not welcome here.",null,0,null,1425908401,null,0,false,0,cp937zc,null,t3_2ybkvg,null,t1_cp937zc,null,t1_cp925a4,null,null,null,1427660115,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

The pupil:staff ratio is probably going to be lower in larger schools. 1 or 2 (partly) open homophobes in my school would only have represented about 1-3% of the total staff. The portion of the population with negative views to homosexuality is substantially higher than that, so it would only take a fraction of the staff harbouring homophobic views to speak out for their to be a large number affected. 

On top of that, you go on about the climate being non-conducive to homophobia, but it's arguably also non-conducive to [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B_LNdLtWoAAVej2.jpg) type of behaviour, yet that man was employed at the school for a lengthy period of time.

I work in the building industry. The prediction is that as long as land supply is constrained (which makes it expensive to build houses) then there's no reason why house prices should fall. 

Everyone needs a place to live... as such, demand is highly inelastic. What is more likely, to my mind, than a house price crash, is that as housing ownership consolidates into the hands of primarily the already-rich, rent will continue to increase. People will increasingly be faced with a choice of either pay more ££ for rent, or be homeless. We are nowhere near the limit yet at which people are prepared to pay no more for rent, as expensive as it already may be. Be prepared for a world where paying 30%-40% of your monthly income on accomodation is seen as quite reasonable.

Any reduction in house prices is only going to be minor and temporary.

The first issue I see here is that if John is the primary employer, then John needs to be the one sponsoring your father's visa. 

Second issue re. what type of visa your father needs, it depends on what sort of work he does. [Here is some useful information to help you work it out.](http://www.workpermit.com/uk/uk.htm)

Essentially there are different tiers of visa, depending on what type of migrant your father is. If your father is a Entrepreneur, Investor, Graduate Entrepreneur or of 'Exceptional Talent' then he is tier 1. 

Tier 2 sounds most likely for your father. Tier 2 includes ""workers who have an offer of skilled work and a certificate of sponsorship from a UK employer with a valid Tier 2 sponsorship licence."" HOWEVER, please note that at this current time in the U.K. this might be quite difficult to get. If John was willing to sponsor your father it might be difficult (maybe someone can help me out on this part), but essentially because of EU laws employers who want to hire non-EU citizens must first prove that the position cannot be filled by a current EEA citizen. This is additionally more difficult to get as since 2011 a cap has been set to 20,700 tier  2 visas per year.

I assume your mother and yourself would also be covered under a spouse visa. If you're a student you'll need a tier 4 visa to study in the UK. Also, I'm not entirely sure on this matter but if you and your mother moved over here I'm not entirely sure you'd have a right to work-someone more experienced and knowledgeable here will need to answer that part, I'm genuinely interested to know if he could.

 * first direct has a 6% saver you can open alongside which could be worth considering

 * the first £250 of the overdraft is interest and fee free, so you can move that somewhere that accumulates interest as well for 6 months. every little helps right?

 * the account is opened online but the switching portion has to be done on the phone.




halifax:

 * £125 bonus if you switch

 * £5/mo if you have two direct debits coming out each month and £750 going in

 * the switch is online so you don't need to dick about with the phone

In Ireland their solution to the property crisis has been to introduce an arbitrary deposit threshold.

It has just led to people paying the mortgages of buy to let landlords who could afford the deposit rules.

At the end of the day, your deposit is irrelevant to repayments (other than being instrumental in determining how much you pay back).

Indeed. I live in Aberdeen. Known by many as 'the oil capital of Europe' but to me as simply a Foward Operating Base of foreign oil industry.

By all rights the industry in good years earns quite a lot of money (as the higher costs of living, house prices, etc attest to) but very little of that money seems to land here along with the extracted black gold.

By all rights Aberdeen should be a wealthy city, and on paper it 'looks good' but off of the business park sites, and top tier housing it's pretty much as thread-bare as other cities.
Our local health provision is actually some of the worst in Scotland, our council is pretty negligent. I can't say how much of that is just bad luck for us or the fact that it's a small city council operating with heavy influence from the oil sector, but it runs in a fashion which any self respecting city further south would find appalling. 

Essentially the money that is made in or near Aberdeen leaves with the companies/workers who are mostly from elsewhere.
The article I think is spot on. They have no ties to Aberdeen beyond making money, no loyalties to the city, no civic pride or a concept of using their wealth to improve the city in the long run. 
It's not their home.

Can't blame them, it's the job of Aberdonians to look out for Aberdeen, not some foreign company or workers just making use of an opportunity to earn wealth.
Problem is Aberdeen has no real home-grown oil industry. Most locally owned and run companies are merely serving the oil industry, making their quick bucks off of it, with little planning for the future. I suspect many home-grown wealthy will up and leave along with the oil sector itself once things dry up. There's a distinct short-termist culture here.

It reminds me of how the current British economy and government appears. On certain bits of paper there's a veneer of wealth and prosperity but look just a little further beneath and you can see a country that is operating almost two distinct economies. The big-money financial sector which largely operates independent of the country as a whole, with money flowing in and out having never benefited the large majority of the country, and the actual economic activity of the public. 

Personally I think Germany was right to concentrate on home-grown business', emphasising long-term if not quick and absurd profit, and this is borne out by Germany's current economic dominance.

People can accuse Germans of protectionism and nepotism all they want, but there is a business culture in that country which measurably benefits it.",null,0,null,1425909461,null,0,false,0,cp93o5s,null,t3_2yfcq8,null,t1_cp93o5s,null,t1_cp92lzu,null,null,null,1427660324,null,51,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,51,null

By 1979 that was down to 17.62% of GDP. ***By the time she left office, that decline had continued - albeit at a slightly slower pace, down to 15.18%.*** Now it is much lower, according to the ONS - down to 9.68% in 2010.

In the smallish village just outside Birmingham I used to live in, every couple of years a group of gypsies would break into the playing fields (they put bigger and bigger barriers up over time to try and stop this) and camp out there for a month or so.

Over the time they would be there, anything on front lawns would be stolen, bikes nicked, non of the local kids could use the playing fields and play area because the traveller kids would threaten any other kids who went near, they emptied their chemical toilets onto the tennis courts (that the local club could barely afford to maintain anyway), dog walkers couldn't walk their dogs without being threatened, all the local club football games had to be cancelled because they were living on the football pitch and then there was all the rubbish and stuff left behind afterwards. This happened 5-6 times in the time I lived there.

Not to mention the fact my grandparents ended up falling for one of their dodgy building scams, and trying to take my granddad to the cash machine and harassing them. Thankfully my granddad had wisened up, and they finally left them alone when my dad threatened to arrest them. 

I haven't had much of experience of Roma's besides the beggars here in London and Rome and Berlin, but in terms of Irish Travellers it's been nothing but negative.

Our website is still on its way, but if you want to keep up with everything that we're organising in the meantime, you can find us on facebook (facebook.com/thehitpointuk) and on Twitter (@TheHitPointUK), or if you have an idea for an event, or fancy a chat, then feel free to pop us an email at hello@thehitpoint.co.uk

If, by contrast, people refuse to buy tickets with an extortionate mark-up, write to acts and venues explaining why they refused to purchase a ticket and support companies trying to offer tickets at a reasonable price, the price will very soon fall to the marginal cost of production (which will be low, but non-zero). This is a really good outcome.

If people can't be bothered to bouycott predatory companies because they want gig tickets more than they want a well-functioning market then it clearly isn't a priority for most people and I feel they deserve the market they get.

**Product claims:** *""Age defying toner is specially designed to gently cleanse your skin while beginning to fight signs of ageing. Helps reduce the appearance of fine lines, improves surface skin dullness &amp; helps to noticeably smooth skin texture. Helps to maintain skin suppleness. Helps promote natural renewal of the skin's surface to reveal younger looking skin Removes remaining traces of make up and impurities from the skin. Hydrates and softens skin.""*

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV.
I bought this because I wanted to try using salicylic acid for my SD.

**Your opinion:** I recently found out that my skin is prone to SD flareups and salicylic acid is repeatedly suggested to help treat flareups and maintain SD-free skin. I have never used SA before and I figured my skin would like it as it does tretinoin, azelaic acid and AHA.

I chose this one because the ingredients list looks good and has no alcohol. I couldn't find the SA concentration or the pH, but another option was Clinique Mild Clarifying Lotion (no alcohol too) at higher price point and reviews saying it's tacky.

The first time I tried this, some my sebaceous filament plugs on my nose looked a bit inflamed and turned to red. It doesn't look like clogging from products that clog my skin. I've heard of purging from actives like tretinoin, AHA and BHA, but I doubt the SA and/or pH in this product is strong enough to cause that. Other ingredients are less likely to cause breakout on me, so I suspect my skin doesn't like SA.
I persisted for 2 weeks but the little red bumps wouldn't go away.

I stopped using it and the little red bumps disappeared. When I tried this product again, they came back.

Other than that, the toner feels comfortable. Well, too comfortable for having niacinamide AND salicylic acid. It's light, not tacky and not drying. Perhaps other people would have better luck.

**Price of product:** €30 for 50ml

**Where did you purchase:** Smart Supermarket (Malta) - I bough this during grocery shopping. I will repurchase in Sparkle Image where it's sold for €20, instead

**Product claims:** *""Olay Regenerist Night Renewal Elixir helps resurface your skin while you sleep, revealing smoother, tauter-feeling skin night after night. That’s because the fast absorbing hydra-glycolic formula provides gentle exfoliation and hydration.*

*The Results: - Hydrated, smoother-looking skin - Resurfaced skin that appears smoother and tauter.""*

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV.

**Your opinion:** I always thought that Retin-A alone would suffice to do all the exfoliation, but I recently learned that it doesn't do exfoliation like AHA is supposed to, so I want to incorporate AHA back in.

I feel slight tingling upon application for the first few times but I no longer experience it. The gel is very lightweight and pretty hydrating for my skin, even used alone. I always wake up with plump, bright, hydrated skin when I use it at night. It also helped to smooth away the bumps I got from the Olay Age Defying Toner. I haven't used it long enough to see if it helps with fading hyperpigmentation.

It doesn't aggravate my SD or clog my skin. I will keep using and repurchasing.

Carroll wasn't your unselfish big man content to play second striker the way Heskey was - he worked best leading the line, with the entire team built around him and making the most of his physicality (see Newcastle before and West Ham since). 

Suarez was so much more than your small man poacher - in fact, given his wayward finishing in his first 1.5 seasons in England, being a poacher is arguably what he was worst at. While capable of attacking direct passes into space, he also preferred a style of play more based around passes to his feet.

Both strikers wanted to lead the line, and both demanded completely opposite types of service. It's no surprise that each combined better with one of Kuyt or Bellamy than they did as a duo.

Also, I wouldn't say Adam was bought *for* or *because of* Carroll, but more as part of a strategy that incorporated both - Damien Comolli had decided that teams that successfully cross the ball often will perform better, hence bringing in Adam, Downing and Henderson, all players with good crossing stats and chance creation and set piece delivery - and having Carroll there to get on the end of them.

However, I strongly disagree with your conclusion. That cabinet jobs were unsuitable for pregnant women and that the risks of stress is equal to that of smoking.

For a start we can't possibly know how stressful or not someone might find that job and workload, only a person who is subject to that workload could tell you weather or not they found it stressful. If someone have worked hard enough as MP to be chosen to be on the front bench they are clearly good at their job. Men and women are doing the job right now and look to be able to coup quite well. Being pregnant does not necessarily make one less able to adapt and coup with stress or put you at greater risk of stress.

Smoking is the leading cause of death and you gave no evidence, none that implied that stress caused anything like as severe damage as the damage caused by smoking. 

On top of that, you chose to instead of engaging in good nurtured debate to be rude, condescending, lower the tone of discussion and stifle debate.

Glasgow is a gorgeous victorian city, at the university you'll be living in the West End, undoubtedly the nicest part of the city. The nightlife far outclasses Edinburgh and St. Andrews, during the day we've got plenty of museums etc., and you're also about 30 minutes away from the Highlands for some incredible scenery. Glasgow is the largest city in Scotland, and the city centre is supposedly the best for shopping outside of London if you like that sort of thing. We're pretty well served by restraunts too. There's clubs &amp; societies for pretty much anything you can be in to, although honestly most decent unis will have this.

I've visited St. Andrews a few times and honestly I'd advise against it. It's a lovely quaint little seaside town with an incredible golfing heritage but beyond that the public transport is abysmal (no train station, at all) and there's not a huge amount in the way of nightlife (some decent pubs, but their union feels like an airport and there's one club in the town). Nice for a visit, and I'd defintely recommend you go and stay a while, but not living there for four years. That said it's full of Americans so they seem to like it.

Edinburgh is a decent city, and a close second to Glasgow. It is more expensive, and a bit smaller. The museums are better, but you're further from the highlands and the nightlife isn't quite as good.

In terms of reputation the scottish unis are all relatively equal, depending on your specific course.

But look at how technology has changed the world in the last 50 years.. the last 100 years.

During World War 2 we faced very real bombing and invasion threats that could be defended against by a solid air, naval and ground force. 

Nowadays aircraft and strategic nuclear weapons mean that any serious attack will move far too fast for our ground troops to make much difference. Anti-naval defences? Well it’s not like we have those as densely packed as we did in WW2 times. 

Also consider the cost of modern equipment versus WW2… A single Supermarine Spitfire cost around £9000 to £13,000. A Eurofighter Typhoon (including development and production costs) is £125million.

Now fair enough there’s inflation but the cost of war *has* increased and advanced way beyond what it used to be. 

Memories may be short but the game has changed – so has the world. The next war, if and when it happens, won’t be like the last.

The NHS and the Schools budget will be ring fenced in the next Parliament according to the Tories, but that's because there are so many vested interests in those budgets. The NHS is the 4th largest employer in the *world* and by far the largest in the UK, while teachers and their assistants often have a large stake in marginal constituencies. Not to mention they both have very large and well funded trade unions to fight the Government, the army has none of these things.

I can however and always have been able to absolutely see where you are coming from but at the same time you fail to understand regional differences in the use of language. 

&gt;On the other hand, there's no evidence that an accident blackspot has originated from racial terminology. Black is a very widely used word in our language.

The word blackspot is a word used in purely negative situation, one where the area is particularly troublesome or of some concern. Not a great way for the word 'black' to be constantly associated with.

In your own words

&gt;It's the sort of abuse of the word ""blackspot"" by people such as you that reinforces the social construct that a social group is inferior.

I just don't see why you think using the word Gay to describe something is much different than using the word 'retard' or 'blackspot' that can easily offend other social groups. If it is perceived to be offensive surely it's use should be stopped?

Basically to sum it all up, Reddit as always is full of hypocrites who are happy to say something and go along with it however hilarious the irony is if it supports their argument. The fact you're trying to further suggest that use of retard is alright because it just 'exaggerates' the situation is laughable. Along with Reddit forgetting that not everyone lives in the same area as yourself.

Started it a long time ago at mod request to help avoid image-related spam; it's a pretty dead subreddit where the top posts are like 8 upvotes, and that's not very appealing to post to.

I note that there's no opposition in these guidelines to image posts - maybe can there just be an [IMG] tag or something that people can opt out of viewing?

I'd like to be able either to run a subreddit where there are requests for images and good submissions from lots of Spurs fans or to collapse it back into /r/coys because it just hasn't worked without any /r/coys backing at all.

It's been known from the moment the transfer went through that Torres's transfer was contingent upon Newcastle's price for Carroll. Liverpool valued Torres at 15m more than what Carroll cost and Chelsea agreed to pay whatever Newcastle wanted.

If Newcastle valued Carroll at 20m then Chelsea would have paid 35m for Torres. If Newcastle wanted 40m for Carroll then 55m is what Chelsea would have paid for Torres. 

With that knowledge I think its completely unfair to look at the Carroll transfer as a stand alone incident. 

Newcastle clearly came out the best but we did sell a completely out of form striker for profit for an extremely promising and in form young talent. I think it was really good business at the time.

null,false,duckalors,null,null,null,"&gt; One symptom of a bubble is everyone thinking prices couldn't possibly fall and rationalizing that

well lets kick off with that one - its a bit rich to declare 'prices *will* fall, we are in a bubble' - and claim that challenging that is some kind of evidence for a bubble. it's not. 

argument against is simple - unless interest rates rise (and there are few predictions from anywhere of a significant rise in the foreseeable future) then demand is still much higher than supply, and that is not changing in the foreseeable future. We could easily see rises in the next few years undone by a fall later but overall increase in that period (as happened in the last few years). 

plus it is not necessarily legitimate say that we are in a bubble, if it takes an extra-ordinary event like very high interest rates to 'correct' or change the prices. it may be a semantic argument but i would say it can't be called a bubble if the affordability of houses (the amount of money it costs to fund a purchase rather than the actual price) is not that far away from normal levels. Mortgage repayments are cheap, and have been for over a decade. 

fwiw i would be pretty happy with a drop in prices so long as it is not accompanied by a recession - because i plan on buying a much bigger house in 3-5 years - most of my wealth is not tied up in property already. but i just can't see it happening since supply is not shifting and very high interest rates is not the norm.

If the processing fee was more like £50 on a £50 ticket, *then* I think that scenario would be plausible.

Whether or not competition can sort out the market depends whether you think 'live music' is a good you consume or whether you absolutely *have* to see The Smiths live whenever they play. I gave an analogy elsewhere that the market for 'chocolate ice cream' would probably not be functional if I would never accept vanilla ice cream as a substitute at any price, and nor will the market for live music be functional if people will pay any price to see an act perform and (for example) listening to their album at home, or going to see some live music down the pub, or going to consume a different form of media (cinema, for example) does not function as an adequate substitute. In that case, of course you're going to get scalped, but I don't see why the government should step in to stop you being charged the full price for your preferences (in the same way I don't think the government should step in if you gripe that the steak is more expensive than the salad when you eat out). 

As much as I appreciate that live music is a good many people enjoy immensely and it would be lovely if we could all enjoy it for less money, I just don't see the case for government intervention when the market is clearly functioning exactly as intended and shows routinely sell out even with the mark-up on tickets.

&gt;Moseley security analysts were placed on high alert today after it came to light that the bulletheads of Kings Heath could have a bomb in a matter of weeks. It’s official guys; we’re on defcon 2!

A leaked report from the highest echelons of the emergency joint committee of Moseley Society, Moseley Traders Society, Moseley CDT and Jibbering Records states, “… due to the discovery of… atomic… material… being readily available… the only conclusion that we can draw is that those dumb twats up the road want to nuke our park.”

The Moseley Wardens have been stationed on twenty-four hour watch from classroom C5 of Queensbridge School to watch of signs of an imminent missile attack. Herr Oberfuhrer Kim Monaghan of the Moseley Wardens said, “We’ve figured that if there is a launch, we’ll be able to give the good people of Moseley an eight second warning before impact. This should be enough time to say, something along the lines of “Oh Fuck!” at least. It’s a worthwhile, but thankless task.”

P.C. Borg of The First Woodbridge Road Truncheon was seen issuing anti-nuclear umbrellas whilst muttering, “Shiny, shiny, shiny…”

A spokesbullethead for Kings Heath is quoted as saying, “… the whole thing is absolutely preposterous. We think the idea of us nuking Moseley Park and Pool is utterly bizarre. We’ve got two perfectly decent parks of our own and whilst we may not have an icehouse and some rare ducks, we’ve got the T.V. Garden from T.V.’s Gardener’s World. Beat that one hippies!”

The whole misunderstanding is thought to have arisen when some indie kids where overheard talking in Nima’s whilst purchasing a Hershey’s “Cookies and Cream” bar. It’s has been suggested that the whole incident was caused by much excitement and mirth at the sudden abundance of the Ned’s Atomic Dustbin back catalogue in Cash Converters.

That doesn't mean to say that anyone can do anything they like in their place of worship though. Just as Christians don't go partying and throwing up in St Paul's Cathedral, no one should be doing so on Stone Henge.

a)	People comment on what they don’t understand or what stands out as different to them. You might see people turn and stare at a drag queen, someone wearing a Niqab, a furry in a wolf onesie, a bloke in a balaclava in the height of summer who isn’t on a construction site… *anything that stands out*. Yes people might stare but I’d imagine a percentile of those are interested in the spectacle. 

(That doesn’t excuse the name calling and insults which surely do fall under the category of homophobia or at least prejudice / stupidity of some people. 

b)	In schools I wonder if this is a problem – how many kids dress in drag or more flamboyantly? Kids will bully each other just for dressing a bit differently *anyway* (look at how groups like goths are also treated – just for being in a different ‘group’). So I do wonder how much of that is down to a real dislike of homosexuals and how much of it is due to basic childish bullying for simply being different. 

(Again, this doesn’t excuse it or claim it doesn’t happen – it’s more a look at why it might happen). 

Let me be clear that I absolutely believe anti-homosexual behaviour takes place and can be quite brutal… 

…But in the context of the article I can easily see how young people would hear *any* insult against themselves or even any criticism of themselves and turn it (either wilfully or instinctively) into an attack on their sexuality, as that is most likely the most vulnerable spot upon their person. 

The study doesn’t give enough detail to know for sure… was each child called a ‘faggot’ at the hands of teachers, or were they singled out for misbehaving, called and idiot and interpreted it as a homophobic attack? 

I don’t mean to down-play anti-gay mentality as though it doesn’t happen, but I’d rather not *easily* admit there’s a rampant rash of homophobic teachers in our schools as a knee jerk reaction either. 

TLDR: Need more data to know for sure if there’s a real issue towards homosexuals in education, or if it’s a sensationalist / shallow study that doesn’t give us all we need to know.

&gt; Whilst this study also found that hi-visibility vests and jackets made no difference to the space left by overtaking drivers, it did not try to look at whether these devices made cyclists more visible at intersections or at night ... that there is surprisingly little evidence that high-visibility clothing for cyclists and motorcyclists offers any safety benefits in daytime

This article seems inconclusive since it's not looking at overall safety but rather at driver behaviour to cyclists. Equally it appears to be looking solely at daytime events (at least it makes no distinction between daytime and nighttime event) so I'd argue it's not really pertinent to cycling at 3am.

### Nottingham

&gt; Cases were adult commuter and utility cyclists who were involved in a crash resulting from a collision or attempted evasion of a collision with another road user.

Does this mean they were looking solely at cases where the driver swerved to avoid a collision and hit a cyclist because of that?

&gt; The odds ratio was not significantly affected by adjustment for ... the use of bike-mounted lights or reflectors

I could be misreading it but this seems to suggest that bike lights and reflectors made no difference either.

&gt; This is not consistent with the large body of evidence suggesting that conspicuity aids increase the distances from which wearers can be detected and recognised by drivers in a variety of settings.

Obviously there's no evidence here that this correlates with increased safety but being seen from further can't be a bad thing.

This study does seem to suggest that high-vis jackets provide no increase in safety but it also suggests the same for bike lights and reflectors so I don't really understand your statement of

&gt; Lights I totally agree with, even if it weren't a legal requirement. High-vis clothing, on the other hand, doesn't necessarily do anyone any good on the roads.

Being a cabinet member is a stressful job, I don't see how this can be disputed?! Every aspect of your life is out for public scrutiny on top of the fact that high pressure debates (stressful) and fuck ups well out of your control (stressful) are common there really can not be a way to do it without stress. I'm not saying that woman are less capable than men at this, however it is a stressful job. I would also argue that maternity leave should begin when the pregnancy is discovered until a significant period after the birth as this is what has been shown to be healthiest for the child. The mother should not be able to take decisions that effect a child (potentially for the rest of their lives). 

I'm sorry for loosing my temper but when I raise a legitimate point stressful job (of which MP is about the top) endanger the child and you respond with ""what about men in the same situation?"" it shows either complete ignorance, stupidity or malice. 

It also makes me question why I bother devoting my life to tackling disease when we can't take a fact without it falling into men vs women. If a man had the child growing inside of him then I would expect him to be held to same level of accountability, be that from smoking, drinking, drug taking, bad nutrition or stress, if a person can not be responsible during pregnancy they should face the law just as if they caused the harm to the baby once it was born.

null,false,el_matt,null,null,null,"Yeah you're right about Ian Walker's study not being directly relevant here but it stuck in my mind as something to be aware of and I thought I'd mention it as someone else in the same broad field of research.

In answer to your question about this phrase:

&gt;utility cyclists who were involved in a crash resulting from a collision or attempted evasion of a collision with another road user.

I would suggest the key words are ""collision...with another road user"", in other words the crash event considered in the report was a result of interaction with someone else, and not simply (for example) skidding and falling off the bike.

&gt;this seems to suggest that bike lights and reflectors made no difference either.

You are right that the thesis does seem to suggest that, which is interesting. With that taken into consideration, the main reason for requiring lighting on bicycles at night time for me is consistency. I have no problem with people riding a black bicycle, at night, wearing black clothing, **provided** that they wear the required lights and reflectors. When I drive, I drive a black car with forward- and rear-facing lights and reflectors so in a sense, I'm following exactly the same set of rules on a bicycle as on a car. It might not be borne out entirely by those studies but that's my point of view and I don't think it's entirely irrational. I, too both drive and cycle (about 6 miles' cycling a day during the week in city conditions and about 40 miles a week driving in mixed conditions) and so I agree it is vital that drivers see cyclists in plenty of time. What I disagree with, however, is making that the sole responsibility of the cyclist. From my point of view the same rules which would prescribe a high-vis jacket would require me to paint my car bright green.

On the other hand, there is [evidence from overseas](http://road.cc/content/news/139527-high-vis-works-says-danish-study) that high visibility clothing *can* have a positive impact, but then again we are working in a different paradigm to Denmark and so adjustments need to be made there too.",null,0,null,1425920849,null,0,false,0,cp99vil,null,t3_2yfdhk,null,t1_cp99vil,null,t1_cp99ajt,null,null,null,1427663292,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

I'm afraid to say I don't really care about your opinions on fracking or bankers bonuses. 

What I do care about is catching the little cunt who's forced your window while you're asleep, picked up your laptop (which you haven't backed up) and phone. He's then grabbed the keys to your van which was parked outside and which you were going to use to go to your anti fracking demonstration the next day with your mates. He's taken your van and gone off and committed some more burglaries with it. He's also left the window open and now a fox has got in too and shit all over your front room. 

But as it happens Billy Burglar is well known to the police and was stopped only 20 mins before hand skulking around a place he had no reason to be in. His description was recorded and filed on the Intel system. He's wearing a black scarf, an LA Kings bobble hat, a mckenzie jacket and some distinctive Nike air max trainers.            
Thing is, you've got cctv in your house, maybe it's at eye level, maybe it's not because you're concerned about gchq the nsa. It has recorded a figure burgling your house. Trouble is his face is covered with a scarf. But the cctv clearly shows he's wearing an LA Kings bobble hat, a mckenzie jacket and some distinctive Nike air max trainers. It sounds like someone we know. 

Also he's walked across your kitchen floor and left a footprint, invisible to the naked eye, but not to CSI. It matches the shoes seen in the cctv and recorded on the Intel report. The police suspect Billy Burglar is the culprit and go over his house to nick him. They then carry out a section 32 search of his flat and find the trainers that match the footprint found in the kitchen, along with your laptop, phone and the keys to your van which is found a few streets away.

I would argue that stress is not an objective thing. What one person find stressful others might find well within their tolerance. 
and when we talk about stress how do we measure it? Because as i'm sure you're aware stress can range all the way between annoyance to traumatic stress. Was the kind of damage you link to a result of mild to moderate stress or severe and traumatic?

Where do we hold the bar on what jobs are too stressful for pregnant women?

The only way we would know how stressful someone might find it would be to ask them if they found a situation stressful and trust their judgement.

Know why?

Because in free floating currencies, the *issuer* sets the own rate, not the user. The gov't, acting through the Bank of England, sets interest rates on debt, not 'the market'. Today, the BoE only really targets short term rates, but nonetheless, when the gov't borrows sterling on a short term basis that's the rate it gets. 0%.

Japan's the same. The US is the same. Free floating fiat = interest rates set by the issuer, and owners of the currency can't do much about it, as much as they'd like to.

That link shows GDP per person adjusting for inflation is down. Surely GDP per person adjusted for inflation is the more important measure and it is still not above pre-crisis levels according to the stats you posted. 

Average wages are up?? From what period to what period? Your link is not clear, it seems to be from April 2013 - April 2014 which clearly does not tell the whole picture. Most people argue we have had the longest period of wage stagnation and its just getting a bit better now because of low oil prices. 

Talking about the personal tax allowance in isolation is not very useful. Need to also talk about wage stagnation, VAT rises, cuts to social welfare and benefits and cuts to top rate of tax.

Why are you comparing us to the Euro Zone with places like Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain dragging Euro Zone statistics done? Why not compare us to the USA, Germany and France? We have not done well compared to those countries.

So, I was thinking about anarchists and direct action (I'm writing a book with an anarchist character in it, so I've been spending a lot of time staring into space and thinking about the Spanish Civil War, and hardly any time writing, which is what I call 'writing').

If the aim is to change laws through direct action (as is the case with workfare), doesn't that constitute a level of engagement with the legal system in the same way that voting or writing to your representative does? It's still based on the same basic premise, which is that a) there are representatives of the people (MPs, in this case) and b) these representatives can be made to listen to those they represent.

So, purely in terms of the argument (which I realise you don't necessarily personally espouse) that voting or writing to MPs constitutes an engagement with, and, therefore an endoresment of, representative democracy, does direct action not *also* constitute an endorsement of the same?

null,false,Dzerzhinsky,,Socialist,null,"You might be interested in the EU's [opinion polling site](http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/index_en.htm).  It's a really fantastic resource for these kinds of questions.

The EU has actually been solidifying its support in the UK recently, with the latest [Yougov poll](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/a6wy2gtckh/YG-Archives-Pol-Trackers-Europe-Referendum-230215.pdf) putting 45% in favour of remaining a member compared to 35% against -- which from a brief skim might be the largest 'In' lead for many years.

This has been mirrored by an increase in the UK's 'trust' of the EU, which despite still being low has gone from 16% to 26% in the space of only the last year.  But this hasn't really been a case of convicing those who distrust/dislike the EU; rather it has been a case of convicing those who used to put themselves down as 'don't know' on polls.

I'm speculating here, but I'd say this is primarily just down to the increased exposure and debate around the issue since the EU elections last May.  Before then the only time you'd hear the subject mentioned was by UKIP or other critics, while since then the pro-EU forces have made more of an effort to put their point accross.  That combined with the threat of an impending In/Out referendum has made more people choose a side.

So, what about those who don't like the EU?

Well, you'll hear a fair bit about the democratic and economic arguments on the internet.  Since significant pluralities think the UK's economy and unemployment would be worse off outside of the EU, I don't think we can look to that as a primary cause.  Even Farage (leader of UKIP) once [dismissed](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10555158/Id-rather-be-poorer-with-fewer-migrants-Farage-says.html) it as unimportant when reports were coming out saying EU immigration was good for the economy.

And that brings us to the main point.  Immigration.  This is the real reason opposition to the EU is so high in England (I live in Scotland where neither immigration nor the EU are important issues).  Turn on a UKIP interview, or watch a debate on the EU, and it'll be completely dominated by the question of immigration.  Sometimes this will be linked back to economics (""immigrants steal our jobs and drive down wages"") or democracy (""our government has no power over who comes into the country""), but the underlying point is always the same: stop/drastically reduce immigration.

This is reflected in [this polling data](http://i.imgur.com/G0gc0dG.jpg), which puts immigration as the most important issue facing Brits today -- an opinion shared only in Germany and Malta.

I'm not sure about trust, but Yougov polling certainly indicates that opposition to EU membership would drop by 14% and support would rise by 12% if the UK government managed to renegotiate the UK's position in the EU to ""protect British interests"".  And the main interest that is talked about in the context of these negotiations is restriction of immigration.

So it seems the main way to increase trust/support for the EU amongst those who currently oppose it is to reduce concern about immigration.

null,false,elementz_m,null,null,null,"I've been stopped by the police three times when walking late at night, and followed by a police officer once.

1. The following. I was 14/15, and enjoyed skateboarding. It was around 3.30am and I decided to skate to my friend's house, roughly four miles away. A police officer saw me near my house, then I spotted him in four different places along my journey. I just carried on, he saw I was no harm and went on his merry way.

2. Suspicious activity. 19 years old, just finished a shift in a bar, about 5am by the time I was nearing my house. A police officer pulled up, and asked who I was, what I was doing, why I was doing it. He explained there had been a burglary reported in the area. I showed him the contents of my rucksack, told him where I worked, and where I was going, and tootled off home.

3. An inadvisable walk. 1am. Thirty miles from home. Not drunk, but coming down with something and trying to get to bed before getting up at 6. Not enough money in the bank account to pay for a taxi. No coat. Rather cold. Unlit road. Police car stopped me after about 2 miles, and offered me a lift to the next town (a further 10 miles, from there all the roads would be lit, and I would only be 18 miles from home). The policeman said he'd rather give me a lift a few miles than scrape me off the road after I'd been run over. I gladly accepted, made it a further 8 miles, to the edge of my bus route, before hopping into a pub's beer garden to bed down for an hour. First bus back home the next day and I was grand. I'd actually told the officer I had friends who would pick me up after he'd given me a lift, which was a blatant lie, but I was just too embarrassed to admit how spectacularly I'd failed at getting home.

4. Rowdy teenagers. I was walking home from my local pub, and passed a few teenagers who were trying not to look shifty and failing spectacularly. I was making my way down the drive when a police officer pulled up and jogged down to collar me. Turned out, he didn't see how old I was in the dark, and didn't think to ask if I had a set of keys for the house I was outside. Eventually, I pulled out my drivers licence to show him my address, and then he asked me to confirm my postcode, which I did, and then he asked me to confirm the house number, which I did, and I pointed out to him that the big brass numbers on the door also give something of a clue. To be honest, I think I was probably being something of an arsehole, and it would have been a quicker encounter had I been sober.

In all my years of walking late at night, those are my only interactions with the police, and they were all fine. I definitely wasn't searched without good reason, and the police officers were always friendly if I was. Expect to be moved on if you're hanging around outside a bank for hours, but there are people up and about at all times in any city, and there's nothing too odd about going for a night walk. If a policeman approaches you, it's most likely because you're one of the only people he's sharing the city with for the time being, and he's getting back to good old community policing, making sure everyone's happy and healthy.",null,0,null,1425926647,null,0,false,0,cp9dd06,null,t3_2yfdhk,null,t1_cp9dd06,null,t3_2yfdhk,null,null,null,1427664988,null,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5,null

[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_police_forces_of_the_United_Kingdom#Table)

Now couple that with having an incredibly high density population, with more languages than most countries have, tourists, politicians, gangs, high-wealth residents, poverty-line residents, several premier league football teams, hundreds of sports grounds, licensed premises, protest groups, and more which all take up resources.

Add into that most people who want to make a protest head to London to close roads, mob Parliament, etc. Now consider all the embassies, Royal households, political sites, historical sites, transport sites, and god knows what else they need to cover. 

The Met also have national lead for many things like terrorism which adds to work loads.

Pretend 0.1% of officers do something ""bad"" on a shift. This could be a minor thing like incorrectly making a decision on a legal matter to forgetting to tick a box on a form so a suspect isn't dealt with properly. This is about 7 officers in most forces and these mistakes will sometimes get reported and sometimes overlooked. 

Imagine the same situation in the met, still 0.1% of officers, you now have 33 officers making those same mistakes. That's nearly 5 times as many, with no extra levels of incompetence or changes to circumstances. There is a much higher chance of something serious happening. Now given the demographics the Met covers it's easy to see how one of those mistakes could be in a high profile area. 

Basically the Met is huge, it probably isn't much worse than other forces but has responsibility for so much and is so much bigger mistakes and incidents are increased.

I agree with you that there's near zero chance of the EU renegotiating free movement (at least beyond some small cosmetic changes).  It's a fundamental aspect of what the EU is.

Indeed, one of my concerns is that if the Tories form the government after May and hold their 2017 referendum, the announcement that they've completely failed to renegotiate free movement could give a significant boost to the 'Out' camp by demonstrating UK weakness.  But it's also possible it'd have no effect since people who are inclined to think that way already support withdrawal.  Time will tell.

It's got to the stage where I don't sit forward excitedly every time Sturridge or Sterling get the ball anymore, because I just assume they're going to take 12 touches too many and lose a chance to shoot. Sturridge I can cut some slack because he's probably still not fresh yet, but Sterling just seems to dither with the ball and it frustrates the hell out of me at the moment. He needs to learn to be more clinical. We know he can shoot. Surely he knows that too, but sometimes he just tries to dribble through 5 defenders instead of using teammates or just having a crack. Same with Sturridge but not to such a great extent.

I still believe Markovic will turn into something great though, he's just a bit inconsistent at the moment. He was amazing around December/January, but he's lost it *slightly* since then.

No, but there are buses directly to Edinburgh and Glasgow, and a bus every 10 minutes to Leuchars, the nearest train station, which is 12 minutes away and on the East Coast Main Line. You might spend that long travelling to a railway station in a major city.

&gt; and there's not a huge amount in the way of nightlife (some decent pubs, but their union feels like an airport and there's one club in the town). 

Depends what you want really. Multistory nightclubs, don't come to a town of 16,000 people. If you want a couple of nice ""craft"" pubs (STABCO, Aikmans), a couple of nicer cocktail bars (Josper, Hotel du Vin) and are willing to make up the deficit with one trashy nightclub and house parties (which are an integral part of the experience here precisely due to the relative lack of nightlife in the town), then St Andrews is perfectly suited for nightlife.

I'm not able to give links to detailed studies and statistics as I've not read them in depth recently - I am mainly relying that when they are trotted out on shows such as the Daily Politics, Newsnight and Question Time they aren't shot down by the impartial hosts and therefore I assume them to be true. Then I've added some basic googling / wikipedia and my own thoughts to that.

Yes the argument is indeed how Universities should be funded but you MUST hold this in the larger picture of the current state of the UK economy, the fact we're running at a budget deficit and that we sort of need to fix that unless we want to do a Greece/Spain.

---

As the need for an increase in university funding over the years occurred it was proposed that this could be done through the introduction of the tuition fees. (Tories commissioned the report into funding that then recommended it. Labour implemented this and then raised fees again while in government). 

The latest rise was then obviously from the Tories/LibDems and based on more reports. The main points being an increase in fees would bring about an increase funding for universities, savings in government spending as they wouldn't be subsidising universities so much and as universities could have bigger differences in the tuition fee levels they set there would be more choices for students on where to go (Go somewhere with max fees or far lower fees).

Now in practice that last point is pretty bullshit as most places charged the top rate immediately or two thirds of it. Since our economy has also gone down the toilet it's pretty much meant university funding has stayed the same but proportionally more of that funding is now, or will be, coming from students paying tuition fees. (A decent number of students are projected to never pay off their fees before the time they are expire and are written off so the government will still be funding it via that). Studies DO show that more people from low income backgrounds are attending university now and admissions are increasing. The main problem isn't the tuition fees (since you don't pay them up front) but the cost of living increase in recent years. Students from low income backgrounds are actually mostly okay (relatively speaking) due to the various grants and bursaries available to them, the worst affected are those on the cusp of the means tested benefit (Lower Middle Class). So students whose families are judged to JUST be rich enough to support them and are therefore not entitled to anything more that the basic Maintenance Loan.

So, university funding hasn't really been increased by that much overall, but proportionally more of it is now being paid by people who go to university which, in my opinion, is fair. The money this saves then helps the country reduce the deficit.

It's why I'm wary of Labour's plan to reduce the fees to 6,000 a year. I can't remember the exact details of the way they're funding it, I think it's some tax on pensions/savings or whatever. It's not how they're funding it that irks me but rather that they're finding money and spending it immediately when we're still Billions over budget. For what it's worth I'd respect them more if they just went with the tax and kept fees the same so as to actually reduce the deficit.

So it all comes down to what you believe in really. A right to free education for all, even at the highest levels. Or the arguments that we need to find other ways to fund universities (fees) and that going to university DOES give you an advantage in life and you should pay for this in some way. I mean, take two people looking for jobs. Both exactly the same age and experience, but one has a university degree. Obviously the job prospects are in favour of the person with the degree but without tuition fees they would both be having the same PROPORTION of their taxes spent on funding universities which have directly benefited the person who has been far more than the person who has not. (Aside - Yes I do believe universities are a public good and the research that they do benefits the entire population even if you haven't gone to university  so they do deserve government funding but that doesn't entitle Twatty MyCuntFace to get an undergraduate degree for £0 then go into a graduate scheme for some Investment Bank).

I think exceptions could and should be made with tuition fees (Nurses/Teachers etc being exempt) but people who go to university solely to get an undergraduate degree to advance their life prospects SHOULD pay for it. 99% of undergrads are NOT going to contribute to the future of humanity via their dissertation, it'll be those who really want to stay on and do postgrad study that achieve that and it's why postgrads should be funded and undergrads should not).

Then you've got to look at what the tuition fee actually is in it's current form. It will NEVER appear on your credit history, you don't have to pay a penny back until you've graduated and are earning at least around the average national wage and even then you only pay back a percentage of what you earn above that. The interest rate is better than for any other loan you could get at any bank and if you don't pay it off after so many years the entire thing is written off. There is \*literally\* (I did just say that) no other loan or form of ""debt"" like it. This is not some 1000% APR loan from Wonga that's going to end up bankrupting you, I really struggle to get to grips with the people who say university graduates are ""saddled"" with debt or have it ""hanging"" over them, it's pretty insulting to those people who are in real debt. We are far from the American system.

In a perfect world where money grew on trees it would be easy to have higher education free for all - the right thing to do! ..and I'd also like to be a few inches taller and have won the lottery... BUT we do not live in that world. We live in one where the country is in deficit and debt and I feel those people who get the chance to go to university (of which I am one) and advance their life prospects SHOULD pay for the advantage in life this gives them and tuition fees do that in a pretty fair way that does not hold back or stop people from a lower income background as it is, for all intents and purposes, free at point of entry.

I don't think people would really care that much as long as Costa isn't missing chances. Often times, I personally find it detrimental when Hazard will brilliantly drill past everybody until he gets to the penalty area and goes for the safe pass back instead of trying to take on that last defender to get off the shot. I think it would result in more goals for us if Hazard was a tiny bit more aggressive around the box.

Obviously stats can't be the only metric to judge a player and I don't mean for them to be misleading. I was just trying to see if Hazard shoots as much but doesn't convert or if he's not taking many shots. It looks like the latter because he's averaging more than 1 shot less than any of these wingers besides Ribery.

Those are all great questions which was the point of this post to see what are people's thoughts on the matter. Personally, I think it'd only help if he was a bit more aggressive when it comes to getting past the last 1 or 2 defenders and it either creates a chance for himself or a trailing player like Costa.

The strength isn't adapted at places like Starbucks as the amount in a teabag tends to be similar wherever you go. To make your tea have more caffeine in it, you can let it brew for longer although different types of tea have different temperatures that they brew best at and different lengths of time for optimal brewing. Some types of tea are pretty strong, so might have comparable amounts of caffeine to a cup of coffee, others not so much. Popular teas are just a regular breakfast tea, assam and earl grey. I like one called Kashmiri Black which actually seems quite strong although the flavour is still delicate. 

In the North of England, every other sentence is 'shall I make a brew?'. When I go up to visit family I spend so much time in the toilet weeing. With the amount they drink, they must be off their tits on a constant caffeine high, but because it's drip fed you don't really feel that jittery feeling you get with coffee.

I think it is pretty naive to assume that things here will work exactly the way they do in Singapore, although I appreciate it's not always going to be easy to know what to check.  Still, it's worth being extra careful with big ticket purchases till you know the ropes.

Also this only explains you being caught out by Orange the first time.  If you bought another phone from Vodafone you should've been aware that this was at least a possibility and checked the deal beforehand.

As noted if you have the cash (or can borrow it) you can buy a handset outright which will generally be unlocked.  Also some third-party vendors like Carphone Warehouse sell mainly unlocked phones even if you buy them under contract.

Finally you may find that there are unofficial dealers who may be able to unlock your phone for less, although this is a somewhat grey area so once again caveat emptor definitely applies.

With the Mexican market that Hernandez can give Southampton access too it is already a good business decision plus the quality of football at the club is likely to be maintained.

I only gave sulk as one of the options.  He didn't perform and never really gained a strong foothold in the team and was promptly sent back.  He did sulk when he got back to city though when he refused to train.

&gt;At Arsenal, how does 16 goals in a season suggest laziness? With six in the Champions League.
Arsenal fans will tell you all day about how sulky Ade gets to cover over the fact that they lose tons of players to bigger clubs. Rather than admit this, they paint their former players as ""being unwanted anyway"".

Spotty performances, PR issues, hints at personality issues, and the fans were starting to turn against him as well.

http://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/14/arsenal-arsene-wenger-emmanuel-adebayor

&gt;Adebayor has gone off the boil twice. Once at City, and at Spurs. Both times it happened after the managers that had signed him were sacked. It is not that he sulks or is lazy, but as many players he needs a system that fits him.

No player is bigger than the club. You could argue that other players have gone off the boil as well during a similar time period, but they have accepted the terms of our system and have worked their way back into favor, the team, and earned back the endearment of most of the fans, Ade hasn't. Our current system is based upon high-energy, tempo, fitness, and teamwork.  If Ade doesn't want to play in this manner, or thinks that he can adjust the system to fit him, he can continue to sit on the sidelines.

I just feel these changes are moving in the wrong direction. We both agree ideally we want free education for all. I kinda get the feeling the tories don't.

It has minimum initial investment £500 and min top up of £100.

They have loads of funds in different areas.

&gt;Matt Smith's portrayal of the Doctor was met with critical acclaim. Martin Anderson of Shadowlocked claimed him to be the best Doctor since ""Tom Baker practically redefined the character in the 1970s"". Smith's performance in ""Flesh and Stone"" was acclaimed by fans and critics. In his review for The Daily Telegraph, Gavin Fuller noted that ""Matt Smith's 'quick-paced delivery' is 'a major facet' of the success of the current series."" In his review of ""The Big Bang"", Fuller once again praised Smith's acting. ""Matt Smith was superb in his scenes where the Doctor sacrifices himself in the Pandorica to rescue the multiverse"". Kyle Anderson of Nerdist wrote ""I don’t know about you all, but the Eleventh Doctor was MY Doctor."" Dan Martin of The Guardian also claimed Smith as ""my ultimate Doctor.""

And matter of fact, the whole acting cast has been constantly improving through time. We now have Peter Capaldi, who is the best NuWho Doctor acting-wise. We have Michelle Gomez, who knocked it out of the park as Missy. We have guest stars like Nick Frost and Frank Skinner, and we have Jenna Coleman who's the best acting companion. Do you know what the best part is? Acting is objective. You can say ""I don't like Missy"", but you can't say ""Michelle Gomez can't act"", because it's not an opinion.

Which leads to the second point: you're handing a bad case of sampling bias. The fact that your friends agree on something doesn't imply the rest of the world does. In fact, statistics say the opposite: Doctor Who is growing worldwide. This season was the most watched in the U.S.A., whereas just five years ago people outside of UK barely knew the show.

I bought this phone from Orange, and I have only made a switch once (Orange to Vodafone). I either paid or argued my way out of the first NUC only to find out that it's not a one time thing.

My personal opinion is that it's borderline criminal for Vodafone to impose this NUC as
1) I did not buy the phone from them
2) I already paid it/demanded it from Orange the first time.

What now gives Vodafone the right to charge 19.99? Is the customer expected to pay for this *in perpetum* if he wants the choice to switch providers?

Our midfielders really aren't sitting deep when we attack, one of them is almost always bombing on.  It's usually Henderson but when Can partners him he gets forward too.  Allen is just not naturally suited to attacking so he sits more.  When Lucas was in there he was getting forward a lot more than I think anyone expected him to as well, he really should've notched a couple of goals but his finishing is also woeful.

Our shape when we attack with this formation when we play Sturridge up front is actually really similar to what we were doing in the 4-4-2 diamond last season, except rather than dropping a midfielder back in between the CBs, we just have a third CB already there.  Our fullbacks still push up, 2 midfielders are encouraged forward, and we have 3 major attacking players.

You've already demonstrated that you're derogatory towards gay people. So if you want to talk about cherry picking, why is it ok to use degrading comments towards gay people? Or otherwise perhaps you are equally abusive to all minorities, who knows.

You can't simply ban every word that happens to contain ""black"" for fear of people being offended. Let's ban ""menstruation"" while we're at it because it's not nice for men to be associated with it. There's no logic.

The fact is that homophobic language like your own is totally endemic in schools. Children are growing up associating being gay with being an awful burden of hatred. And it's language like yours which ultimately reinforces that belief and drives the high level of mental health issues in lgbt people.

null,false,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,null,"&gt;All worry that planning restrictions will inevitably soften over time. And that there are safety issues: Stickle Tarn is a Category B reservoir, due for its 10-year inspection. Any new buyer will have to question whether that multi-million liability is worth taking on. Will they feel the same obligation to maintain these areas as the LDNPA?

&gt;Will the wild swimmers who love Stickle Tarn be in danger? And what about the neighbouring villages, if the dam should crack – spilling millions of gallons of glacial water, as happened in 1927 at nearby Kepplecove Tarn.

&gt;Even were such liabilities resolvable, you have to ask: why now? At first, the park authority suggested it wanted to sell the land so it could build more visitor sites. Now it’s blaming cash flow.

&gt;Coalition spokesman Lord de Mauley assured Parliament last week that the sale was not due to Government cuts, but the park authority says it has lost £1.56million of Government funding over the past five years and it has run out of options.

That TSB account looks brilliant - it's the lack of required direct debits and the £500/month deposit that is so good. I think I will stick £2000 in there and just leave it.

That means I can be done with the Santander account pretty quickly, or even just close it and put all the remaining £6000 in the Club Lloyds account for the ease of it.

One further question if you do not mind. If I have a standing order from Lloyds to TSB for £500 on the 1st of each month, will it go through immediately?

I think he'd be fine with the physicality of the Premier League. I'm not on the ""St. Leo never dives"" train, but he certainly dives much less frequently than most forwards. There might be an initial period of adjustment, but he'd adapt.

The Amnesty bookshop on Gloucester Rd may be the most famous. It's got a very high stock turnover so if you don't find something of interest one week you might get lucky the next. It also regularly has £1 sales to clear out stock. I've found it pretty good for history and for classics, and its fiction section is substantial and seems reasonably diverse. Sci-fi &amp; fantasy section is a bit small (possibly they sell quickly?), particularly compared to the neighbouring crime section.

The second hand bookshop a bit further up Glos Rd I haven't been in for quite some time but always seemed like it had a good collection.

Oxfam on Park Street doesn't seem so good for fiction, but seems to get a fair number of donations from students, so there are textbooks and more academic factual books.

There's a shop on Colston Street that I've never been into but always has an interesting display of both fiction and factual books in the window.

The shop in St Nick's market seems better for fiction than factual, with a pretty good range of pulpy sci-fi and some good and unusual stuff buried away in the piles.

Finally, the stalls on the Sunday harbourside market are definitely worth a look for a good selection of fiction.

null,false,FezojT,null,null,null,"I believe /u/74159637895123 was referring to the fact that the argument that Scotland should be in the UK is nationalist in the same sense that the argument that Scotland should be independent is. It just depends what side of the coin you're looking at. You can't dismiss somebody's argument on the basis of nationalism and then invoke nationalist sentiment in your own argument. 

I don't live in Scotland, but I gather that the people who were voting yes to independence primarily were looking to create a more progressive country with a government that had greater democratic accountability to the people in Scotland. Essentially the interests of a lot of Scots and the interests of a lot of English people are so fundamentally different that they warrant separate government. A large minority felt that some of those conflicting interests couldn't really be resolved while Scotland was appended to a more right-leaning population who continually elected governments who they felt weren't serving their needs, and so backed the yes campaign to ensure more left-leaning/representative government, less hawkish foreign policy, greater inward investment etc. There were bigots who were likely voting yes out of mere tribalism, but it's naive to pretend there weren't also tribalists voting no, and I certainly doubt that these people made up a significant majority of either camp.

Brown perceives Labour's shunning by the Scottish electorate as an issue of nationalism, which for the most part isn't true. People are shunning Labour because they are increasingly moving right of what most Scots want to vote for, and don't seem to offer any progressive alternative to the other two main centrist parties in the UK. Moreover, Labour look set to keep up the trend of setting policies that will either maintain the status quo or worsen it with regards to London's preferential treatment over the rest of the country; something that I myself, as somebody who splits their time between Cumbria and Warwickshire, can empathise with.

That's my take on it. Perhaps an actual Scottish person can come and fill in the gaps or tell me I'm wrong. From what I gather there is a country-wide growing problem with Westminster-style politics. In Scotland, the popular backlash has seen a surge in support for the SNP. In England, it's UKIP that has capitalised on voter disillusionment. I guess both are pushing their own brand of nationalism, but the fundamental issue is that Westminster isn't seen to be working, not that people want to wave flags around.",null,0,null,1425944150,null,0,false,0,cp9ofne,null,t3_2yh2qu,null,t1_cp9ofne,null,t1_cp9mie0,null,null,null,1427670226,null,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15,null

Lol, your argument is invalid. But in all seriousness, I wonder if every team needs a bad guy in the lineup (not saying it has to be this one, just in general). And for all of Suarez's flaws, he's a hard worker whose teammates seem to like him. Even further, at his best he doesn't just do great things himself. He makes the players around him better. Remember that on top of all the goals, he also led the Premier League in assists last season.

Now I'm not saying we should go get him (and I don't think he'd be interested). I'm just saying his skill set is a good fit for the system we have.

null,false,noggin-scratcher,null,null,null,"&gt; As a basic rate payer, every £100 you sacrifice from your takehome pay means £120 that actually goes into the pension. As a higher rate payer, it will be £140 that goes in.

Close but not quite - take for example the calculation at basic rate; the way you've stated it would suggest that from a pre-tax sum of £120 you paid £20 tax to get net pay of £100 (which has then been returned back to £120 by tax relief), which is only a (20/120) = 16% rate of tax.

It's the other way around - for every £80 you pay, you actually get £100 (the pre-tax amount). Or equivalently, for £100 paid you get *£125* into the pension. 

Then as a higher-rate payer, the same thing again; for every £60 you pay you actually get £100, or equivalently for every £100 paid you get £166.

***

Plus, entirely separately from the tax relief, there's the potential for contributions made by your employer that wouldn't otherwise have been in your pay at all.

It's also not **certain** that tax relief makes a pension advantageous over an ISA. It's probable, but not certain, because you get taxed on income taken out of your pension (aside from the allowed tax-free lump sum) whereas you don't get taxed on the money you've put into in an ISA wrapper. 

If you were to pay the same tax at the time of paying in as you are at the time of paying out then it works out exactly equivalent - you can either pay taxed funds into an ISA then have them tax-free thereafter, or pay tax-relieved funds into a pension then have them taxed later.

Like the fact there's to be a public consultation first:
&gt; The trust has launched a public consultation to determine public reaction to the plan, after which it will lodge a formal application with Natural England and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the government agencies that license such releases. 

Said consultation appears to be here: http://www.lynxuk.org/survey.html

The animals would be GPS-tagged:
&gt; If the plan is given the green light, four to six Eurasian lynx wearing GPS tracking collars would be released later this year at each of the sites, all of which are rich in deer and tree cover. 

It also had a comment article by one of its columnists, which made observations like
&gt;  It’s surely no coincidence that generations raised on exotic fauna are now flirting with the batty notion of “rewilding”, reintroducing animals like bears and wolves to places where they vanished long ago. Lynxes are the latest fad. The Lynx UK Trust is keen to see what it calls “magical animals” (and others call “70lb of teeth, claws and hunger”) roam wild in Scotland, Cumbria and Norfolk.

&gt; The rewilders talk nicely about biodiversity and ecosystems, but what gives the game away is how they always seem to want to reintroduce big, dramatic beasties. Where’s the campaign to bring back the blue stag beetle or the brine shrimp, both absent from our shores since the 19th century? Rewilding isn’t about restoring the glory of nature.

I think Ramires will start ahead of Oscar and Fabregas would move further up the pitch. Ramires has been playing well lately. Jose will most likely use his energy and defensive abilities to our advantage. In a match like this Ramires runs might be very crucial. Hopefully, he won't do anything stupid that would warrant a red card. This is the line-up i am expecting to see from Jose.

null,false,joethepro36,null,null,null,"I have absolutely no confidence that the Labour party will tackle the deficit at all. They aren't prepared to take the hard choices of taking down the debt but they're quite happy to criticise at their leisure.

Try looking at the budget and finding areas to cut from it. It's hard to justify cutting the largest areas because they are health and welfare. I could only find the foreign aid budget and EU contributions being worth cutting, everything else just wasn't justifiable in my eyes.

People on the left often like to say ""cut defence"" and yet we *currently* have not one single fixed wing aircraft carrier in service. We're down to our flagship of the Royal Navy being an amphibious assault ship. We have no practical power projection and extremely limited ability to even defend our allies.

Like it or not, the NHS is one of the biggest parts of the budget and as such should not be immune to cuts. Every party seems to be compelled to protect it at all costs while the demands placed upon it rise year after year. Welfare in the form of pensions, incapacity benefit and housing benefit that takes enormous amounts of public money is to be honest unable to be cut also. All of these things should be cut in equal measure to tackle our budget deficit. You cannot spend what you do not have, such is reality and not opinion. 

My point is that cutting the budget to tackle a budget deficit is extremely difficult. We cannot just spend our way into debt more and more for all time. The argument is always that increased spending will stimulate the economy and bring back tax returns, this does not hold true if you never reign in spending. During the apparent economic boom of the 2000's until 2008, Labour spent ever increasing money on public services without being able to pay for them. I do not trust Labour's views on the budget or the deficit as a result and I urge you all to give a sceptical mind to Labour's claims about them.

Dalek Emperor: Supreme Ruler of the Daleks, he takes the role of the head general and military leader, which ultimately puts him at the top of all Dalek operations since that's pretty much all they're for.

Dalek Parliament: They manage the internal day-to-day affairs of the Dalek Empire. They manage the breeding of new Daleks, the movement of workers between sites and the movement of goods and resources to go to where they're needed. Each Dalek represents a region of the Empire and knows intimately what their sector produces and what it needs to encourage more optimal running of things. One expert for each field is better than a hundred jack-of-all-trades. It isn't so much petitioning the leader as it is working together to make a stronger system.

Davros (and later the Cult of Skaro): These lead the scientific research of the Daleks. These often operate outside of the Emperor's control to allow for more freedom of research but are ultimately beholden to advance the military and technological supremacy of the Daleks.

Id nearly say he's the only ""big name"" that would leave us but you never know who else could go. I'm fairly certain Garbutt will go unless it's true that Oviedo could be off to Sociedad to Moyes as well as Pienaar possibly going there too. Other than that I wouldn't really see anyone else leave. Depending on how Atsu and Lennon finish the season we could be buying both as I belive we have an option to purchase on both and we'd need them desperately as McGeady would be the only senior winger left at the club.

 I think unless Browning will be used much more often another centre back will have to be brought in and most definitely a backup right back too as I can't see Martinez promoting Jonjoe Kenny from the U21s. 

Id like us to also bring in a backup keeper like that Nyland lad (I think that's his name not 100%) but not at the expense of Joel but instead Howard. While Id like Howard to leave I can't see it happening unless Joel is made permanent #1 and he'll leave in January before MLS start again. 

Realistically the only ins I would say we've a chance for are Cleverley, Henen, Lennon and perhaps Atsu depending on the price but other than that I can't see us bringing in any huge signings and really that wouldn't be near good enough because it's not actually improving the squad it's literally doing what we did this year in buying our loans from the previous year and bringing in a young squad player. 

As for the outs I wouldn't be apposed to Pienaar or Mirallas going as long as we got a good price and suitable replacements I wouldn't ljke Oviedo to go but if it meant keeping Garbutt Id take it as he seems a better prospect. Maybe if Pienaar leaves and Martinez (or whoever may be in charge at the time lets be honest) it may open up the left wing spot for Oviedo to become a naturalised winger rather than left back. Id like Tim Howard to go but it's not gonna happen and if Distin decided to retire at the end of the season I wouldn't complain as it would clear up wages.",null,0,null,1425950974,null,0,false,0,cp9sfn5,null,t3_2yhzbm,null,t1_cp9sfn5,null,t3_2yhzbm,null,null,null,1427672164,null,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1,null

Also: you have had incorrect ""exclusive"" information before. We already talked about this. MLS players sign with the league not a team. This is why Lletget's agent said he hadn't signed with the league. MLS doesn't work like other leagues. You don't sign with a team, the league allocates you to a team based on allocation bids once the player has signed to the league. Lletget's agent knows this. The person writing the article should have known this. Not knowing it makes the entire article inaccurate. (Edit, for clarity: IF Lletget had signed with LA while under contract with West Ham, it would mean that LA and West Ham bypassed the MLS transfer system and would likely mean sanctions for both teams. If he is cut from the team, he could theoretically sign with LA, but if a deal was brokered while he was under contract with West Ham, it spells bad news for all sides.)

null,false,TheMania,null,null,null,"&gt; In other words, your solution is to print more sterling

The fact that the gov't *can* print means they're always the safest to lend sterling to means they can never be forced to print *or* default. They can always borrow more.

&gt;suffice it to say if you can find a single source to suggest the UK government can borrow unlimited amounts of sterling

I was really hoping you'd work it through yourself. That UK gov't debt is sold at [the risk-free rate](http://www.ffandp.com/wealth-planning/news-and-insights/insights/?newsitem_id=34), and that the BoE sets for [short-term risk-free rate](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/Documents/money/publications/redbook.pdf) (Part 1 II.4). Therefore when the gov't borrows, it simply pays as much as the BoE wants it to, and no more.

Anyway, just see any of the literature on [modern monetary theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory).  This article may help - [""Please note: there is no sovereign debt risk in Japan!""](http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=13320). As the UK gov't is a free floating currency issuer whose entire debt is denominated in the currency it issues, it's in the exact same boat.

Note: the author there does advocate doing away with bonds, but we may as well. There's very little difference between a currency issuer spending pound denominated bonds into existence to fund its deficit vs a currency issuer spending pound denominated notes into existence to fund its deficit. Both increase the NFA of the non-gov't by the same amount. [Mosler](http://moslereconomics.com/wp-content/powerpoints/7DIF.pdf) argues that if we need the operational fig leaf where the gov't prints bonds instead of printing notes to keep people happy, we simply reduce the term structure to 28 days down from 10yrs to minimize speculation, ultimately a subsidy to the financial sector. I'm inclined to agree.

&gt;First you said investors had a choice, then you said the Base rate is equivalent to the rate on gilts 

I said investors have **no** safer investment choice with their sterling than loaning them to the gov't that issues them. I'm right on that - google ""Risk-free rate sterling"", and see what literally defines it (UK gov't debt).

&gt;you said the Base rate is equivalent to the rate on gilts 

I said the BoE sets the **short-term** base rate. You then compared it to long-term gilts. That was your folly, not mine.

&gt;now you're effectively saying there is an unlimited supply of currency available at the Base rate

You think the BoE can't maintain a base rate of its choosing? Also, note, borrowing doesn't ""use up"" money. When the gov't spends more than it taxes, more gilts enter circulation, but *the same amount of sterling is still there*. Whyever would you suggest that it's somehow been ""depleted"" then?

&gt;so maybe it's you who needs to flesh this out a bit more

I'd still like you to describe to me what the UK gov't being denied sterling by markets would look like. Can banks still borrow sterling, just not the gov't that issues it? Can households? Can you imagine a world where your mortgage rate is lower than that of the gov't's newly issued debt?
