Sorry, can you explain how the amount of pedestrians killed shows that it's car design that's responsible for the decrease? 

I agree that car design is a major factor, but I don't agree that pedestrian deaths prove this. Falling fatalities across Europe generally does prove it though.

Pure speculation but I think we've probably got about 14m (max) left to spend (which is pretty incredible given what we've spent so far), mainly thanks to Downing's sale. I'm guessing we're holding back about 6m for a winger and using the other 8m along with player swaps in the hope of getting Austin or just cash on it's own for Hernandez. Either way, i think this explains why we haven't gone all in with cash for Austin and are being linked with free agents and loan deals otherwise.

In other words, I'm guessing Austin is number one target and always has been but we can't really afford to spend more than 8m (roughly) on a striker right now. It's interesting, I don't think there's ever been a player with more potential clubs linked to him and clubs that want him without actually showing interest, if you know what I mean. Personally I think it's paramount we sign him if he goes for anything less than 15m, purely for the reason that we can't let a team around us have such a lethal striker.

The most powerful broadcaster in the land can't gently poke fun at the glorious leader.  The police can arrest whoever they like on whatever charges they like and no-one calls them out in it.  The population clearly hate the rule, but are so impotent that they need a magic man in a mask to help them see the light.

Whereas today we find that actually everyone can - and does - shout about everything that they want as much as they like.  We have more means of expression and voice than anyone has in history so far.  Nobody in the public eye gets away without being mocked and ridiculed.  We have some of the most exacting FoI legislation in the world, and every piece of data is teased out, spun this way and that, shouted about and broadcast to the world.

That's to say nothing about where all our data goes - not to the government, who have to fight to get their hands on our lives (which is very much how it should be) - but to the corporations and enterprises to whom we readily offload our entire lives, all our habits and thoughts, everything we are to the point where they're at the forefront of modern technology because no-one has ever had to deal with this much stuff before.  And there's no system in place to hold *them* in check, even though, in terms of their knowledge of our daily lives, they are far more advanced than our governments ever will be.

I hate these comments that we need to be listening to messages like those in V for Vendetta, or 1984 which often comes up similarly.  Sure, our governments need to be held in check, but, by and large, we're doing a good job of that.  (At least in the UK - I can't speak for other countries.)  No, the bigger issue facing modern society is us - how we treat each other when we're sitting behind faceless screens; how we so readily open up our lives on the internet without really knowing when to set the limits on our privacy; how we lock ourselves into our own little echochambers so willingly, without any proper form of dissenting thought.

Mirallas for 8 mil is solid business, to me.  If he had a season like he did two years ago, the price would be double.

I don't know much on Lanzini, but if he provides quality minutes, I will never turn down depth. Especially for the season we may have to go through. Europa could be rough, and we're going to need all the help we can get. 

Diarra got a shit situation finally figured out. I'm happy the club haven't given up on him, because he's really quite talented.  Until Song gets fixed up and actually secured his move, Diarra makes a great addition to an already good line of defensive midfielders.

If your joke looks bad out of context, you might have to explain yourself. That's all. 

&gt;If people didn't make such a big deal out of it, his superiors wouldn't have cared. It's a contrived political issue

Well, maybe. I'm still convinced the traditional media would have picked it up sooner or later;  all the furore achieved was to bring it to light earlier. 

&gt;  Let's not forget that right afterwards he went on to praise women in science. He was *balanced*, and *fair*, he was not trying to push some kind of agenda; but with the reaction, you'd think he was. 

Saying something unacceptable and following it up with the anodyne is not fair and it is not balanced;  it is unacceptable regardless. 

&gt;With the reaction, you'd think he'd gone on a rant about how women are all terrible and useless at science, or worse: actually hit a woman. That's what it takes to lose a job, in my eyes. Look at what it took to get Jeremy Clarkson fired.

Clarkson is a comedian. No one's implying that his opinions were those of the BBC.


&gt;This isn't okay though. This lines up exactly with the article I linked in the last comment. *""the regime compels its subjects not only to obey but to believe.""*

Hardly;  it's journalism. A senior academic supporting women in the lab is dog bites man stuff. 

&gt;Not really. For a lot of people, their job *is* their livelihood. It is tough. When you go for someone's bottom line based on their political views... that is overstepping.

Be careful what you wish for. If institutions are made unable to fire people for expressing incompatible views, the perverse result will be ideology checks as a condition of employment. While there must be some protection for freedom of conscience, that holds less for views expressed publicly and less again for persons in the public eye. 

And it certainly doesn't apply for Hunt; he's certainly not going to be left destitute by losing a few mostly unpaid positions. 

&gt;Here is what Tim has said about his lost vocation:

&gt;&amp;gt;“I am finished,” he says. “I had hoped to do a lot more to help promote science in this country and in Europe, but I cannot see how that can happen. I have become toxic. I have been hung to dry by academic institutes who have not even bothered to ask me for my side of affairs.”

&gt;I read this and I just think: this is a travesty. Not only has he lost something, but the world has. All because he dared criticise women; even in jest.

I'd call it a tragedy, and one ultimately of his own making. He chose to become a public figure, and he failed at it; call it hubris.


&gt;You seem to assume they care about the distinction. As I said earlier, the only reason it's a PR problem is because fanatics blow it up into being one. It is a contrived, non-issue, that only stands out due to the ridiculous social climate we find ourselves in.

The flexibility going forward there is what makes them so attractive to me as prospective buys.

Whilst I'm incredibly happy with Kane's progression and he will obviously start the season as first choice striker; there is so certainty that he will capture the same form as he did last season. That's not to say he will do poorly, rather, last season was so incredible that it will be very, very tough to match it. We should remember, the guy is very young. It might not be the best situation to expect him to play every single game in the league. He's still developing, and there's certainly a lot to be learnt; and Hernandez certainly wouldn't be a bad player to learn from, and possibly take over as first choice should Kane struggle for any reason. 

I would actually love to see him starting quite a few games for us. I read somewhere that he has the fourth highest goals per minute ratio of any striker in the Premier Legaue era (I think it's around a goal every 118 minutes, which is frankly absurd). Surely a relatively big club would be foolish to not give him regular minutes and see if he can maintain that form. Last year in La Liga he was also up there, and I think he finished in the top five of goals per minute also. 

I doubt he'll come to us, especially if we really are interested in Berahino. But you've got to think he would be a good acquisition. He's a proven PL striker, with experience at two massive clubs, one of which have possibly the worst fans in world football. He's proven to a be a perfect super sub. He's just hitting the prime years. He'd also be a relatively good option if we wanted to mix things up and play two strikers - him as a poacher, with Kane playing as a CF (where everyone expected him to play originally).

What I take from this is that we are at our *maximum capacity* for players in Mourinho's mind (other than a defender), and to bring in a new player would mean selling a current one in order to not disrupt this.

Although he is in a way saying we are set for the season with our current squad, he's not ruling out any further transfers if the right deal comes along. Also, these statements are hugely important to both our players and other teams - if Mourinho was to come out saying our team is unbalanced and we are desperate for extra depth to catch up to our competitors, not only would we see asking prices rise but our current squad would most likely feel disheartened that they are not good enough. Don't forget guys, Mourinho plays mind games ;)

I know this is all obvious, but the text outside of the quotes seems to be saying more than the quotes themselves.

Only if it's taken out of context. Which is happening... why, exactly?

Not only that, but this is a ridiculous situation. We're only allowed to say things that sound good in all contexts now? You must see how this damages freedom of expression. And I know, he's in a special position, so he should have to behave himself, but *these are the people who are speaking*. *These are the people with voices*. Not for long, say the feminists.

&gt;Saying something unacceptable and following it up with the anodyne is not fair and it is not balanced; it is unacceptable regardless.

Right, but it's only unacceptable by the ridiculous standards that have been built up by slacktivists or other ignorant people who think political correctness does more good than harm.

And again, it was a joke; not serious.

&gt;Clarkson is a comedian. No one's implying that his opinions were those of the BBC.

Why not? Is there some intrinsic quality to comedy? That maybe... it is a separation from reality? An abstraction? Not to be taken seriously? *I don't know what I'm talking about.*

&gt;If institutions are made unable to fire people for expressing incompatible views, the perverse result will be ideology checks as a condition of employment. While there must be some protection for freedom of conscience, that holds less for views expressed publicly and less again for persons in the public eye.

God damn it. It never ends, does it?

That said, I'm not sure hiring based on ideological values is something that would work in our capitalism.

&gt;And it certainly doesn't apply for Hunt; he's certainly not going to be left destitute by losing a few mostly unpaid positions.

Of course not, but was this in the minds of the outrage mob? Do you think they'd care if it was his living?

&gt;I'd call it a tragedy, and one ultimately of his own making. He chose to become a public figure, and he failed at it; call it hubris.

No, I won't call it hubris. I will call what you're doing victim-blaming.

If a girl walks down a dark, lonely alley at night, and gets raped... she chose to do that; knowing that the streets are dangerous. What hubris she has, for choosing to go out there, knowing what would happen.

Are you saying the social justice choir can't help themselves? That they are sick, and become subject to their most basic desires, without any thought of consequence or harm? And that we are to skirt around it; avoiding and ignoring the issue where possible?

&gt;I can't agree; this would have been picked up quickly by the traditional media anyway. We have a vibrant press, and it is as merciless as the social media sphere.

&amp;nbsp;

Jeremy's restaurant used to be open 5 days a week. Lately, however, it had been struggling to cope with the volume of customers, who were all very unhappy about waiting for tables. Jeremy thought long and hard about what he could do to save his beloved restaurant. More staff? Madness. Bigger restaurant? Folly.  
Days passed before an idea struck him. His eureka moment; a lightbulb so bright that it briefly illuminated the darkest recesses of his soul, powered by the kind of endless energy one can only obtain through the combination of a PPE degree and nepotism. Yes, Restaurant de Hunt would open for two extra days. However- and here comes the masterstroke- he would just get the chef to come in. He'd probably just spend his Saturday trying to remember what his kids look like anyway, the lazy fucker.  
The ending to this story is not a happy one I'm afraid, folks. The customers still waited for hours in the week. At weekends, everyone just sat at empty tables looking bemused and hungry. Ultimately, the chef decided that he hated this new life and moved to Australia, where it was sunny and gloriously absent of that prick Jeremy Hunt.

null,false,Josan27,null,null,null,"Here's a story about a bright young chap from Surrey, by the name of Jeremy Hunt.

Jeremy's restaurant used to be open 5 days a week. Lately, however, it had been struggling to cope with the volume of customers, who were all very unhappy about waiting for tables. Jeremy thought long and hard about what he could do to save his beloved restaurant. More staff? Madness. Bigger restaurant? Folly.  
Days passed before an idea struck him. His eureka moment; a lightbulb so bright that it briefly illuminated the darkest recesses of his soul, powered by the kind of endless energy one can only obtain through the combination of a PPE degree and nepotism. Yes, Restaurant de Hunt would open for two extra days. However- and here comes the masterstroke- he would just get the chef to come in. He'd probably just spend his Saturday trying to remember what his kids look like anyway, the lazy fucker.  
The ending to this story is not a happy one I'm afraid, folks. The customers still waited for hours in the week. At weekends, everyone just sat at empty tables looking bemused and hungry. Ultimately, the chef decided that he hated this new life and moved to Australia, where it was sunny and gloriously absent of that prick Jeremy Hunt.

I'm completely fine with us selling Kone. I think he's awful and overpaid(he makes slightly more than Mirallas) and we just need to off shelve him before this transfer window is over.
The author of the paper seems to forget that our starting wingers include Mirallas as an option. He laments having to play cleverly and osman out wide, but we have two excellent options at winger. I definitely agree that we need to buy a solid backup, but it's not like the world is ending because Cleverly wasn't a good winger.

Because than you'd be leaving ISIS's leadership &amp; most important infrastructure intact, allowing them to continuously raise &amp; support more forces to send into Iraq. 

I don't agree with Vietnam, but you'd have to be a fool not to realize how important the Ho Chi Minh trail was to the Viet Cong, and how destabilizing it was to South Vietnam. Same with the Taliban on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan. 

I mean, I don't think anybody wants to occupy &amp; actually go in for the long-haul, but at least keeping ISIS constantly disorganized &amp; fighting on all sides, while supporting our local allies on the ground, is doing *something*.

If we do nothing, than nothing will change. At least with ISIS constantly under threat our allies have a chance to do something, because as fucked up as it is, chaos is the best means for them to gain strength &amp; influence....if it doesn't backfire....which it surely could....but like I said nobody wants to *(or, in some cases, can't afford too)* invade and occupy for twenty years *(without pussying out after just ten years)* so as to have a better chance at avoiding that so meh, if somebody has a better solution other than letting ISIS solidify into a new North Korea or, at the very least, a new Saudi Arabia, just one we have little influence &amp; control over anymore, which can &amp; will constantly threaten it's neighbors, a number of whom we're allied, or at best, committed too, than I'm all ears.

Dividing £660 over 12 months would be a cost of £55 per month, but you'll save £11 in income tax (@20%) and £6.60 in NI (@12%) so a net result of costing you £37.40 per month.

For comparison, paying from your net pay into a SIPP, if you took the same £37.40 you'd get tax relief for income tax paid and have £46.75 going into your pension. So taking the salary sacrifice route gives you a 33% boost.

Consider it carefully - if you can afford to do it, then the return you get from NI savings is really very nice. Although, that said, the actual total *amount* of difference (in terms of numbers of pounds rather than percentages) may not be that huge. So if you expect to be on a higher salary later, you may be able to make up the difference then while feeling less deprived of funds.

You should be able to transfer out your contributions (and whatever growth they've achieved) when you leave, but ask now to be sure, and check whether there are fees associated with that transfer.

Above all else I think it's far more productive to have a left back play left wing than to have central midfielders or right sided wingers play left wing.
I said the same for the England team for years when they constantly tried to play a right sided player on the left.
For the sake of balance and link up play a mediocre left sided player is always going to be better than playing a great right sided player out of position, look how well pienaar links up with Baines and tbh... Pienaar is just about as mediocre-good as a premier league player comes.

I'd go with one of two options.

1) Play two left backs, Baines and Garbutt, put whichever you in whichever role you think would be best and allow their relationship to deliver.

2) Play Geri and Mirallas on the wings and allow them to switch sides, geri is more likely to go wide and head for the line and mirallas is more likely to cut inside, if you allow them to switch this could cause confusion, errors and space for the likes of Rom and Ross to take advantage of.",null,0,null,1437361469,null,0,false,0,ct9b0cz,null,t3_3dw282,null,t1_ct9b0cz,null,t3_3dw282,null,null,null,1438012519,null,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1,null

In order to fully appreciate the situation, we need a little bit of backstory.

I had been backpacking around and found myself in Edinburgh and almost immediately fell in love with the city and the people.  I checked into the High Street Hostel and got down to doing what a 22yr old guy on his own traveling does.  Meet folks and party.  The Hostel was the right place to do both.   I quickly found a great crew of folks that were long term residents of the Hostel.

Due to an insane Australian girl, I ended up leaving the Hostel and moved into a flat with two Scottish friends that were students.  They both happened to be ladies as well.  

Found odd jobs here and there (as this was the early 90's and if you knew where to go, you could find under the table work) and ended up working at Pierre Victoire Grassmarket.  Had a Canadian friend with a two year visa that had to go back to Canada so he sent me his stuff and BAM, I was 'official'.

Through this time, I got into the club scene pretty heavily.  Originally being from Detroit, DJs that were unknown to us in the US were superstars when they came to Europe.  The scene in Detroit was still really underground.  So I got into some house at the Millionaire's Club and found Pure night at the Venue (Friday nights).  I ended up meeting a ton of people and making some fantastic friends while partying like a rock star.

We were clubbing several times a week, going to Glasgow once in a while and I even hit London with some of them a couple of times.  It was a glorious time.  The club scene was really just getting started and the vibe and crowds blew my mind.  

But it was also a different time (from what I heard from my friends in the months after I got back and especially now I believe).  With clubbing, and all the peripherals that enhance the clubbing experience (if you know what I mean), things were a bit crazy.  OK, I am underplaying a bit, things were insane.  Now, the lease ended with my student friends so I ended up crashing at a buddy's flat for a couple of weeks.  Now, the situation in this flat was that it was on the top floor of an office building and their lease was not being renewed, so they were only in the flat for a couple of weeks themselves.  A brilliant idea came into my head to have a free party at this massive flat.  It was perfect.  No residential neighbors to complain about the noise and the flat was really massive.  Two floors, 4 bedrooms, massive front room (with a bedroom right across the hall, that is key) and huge kitchen.

With the help of some friends, I ended hooking up with some guys that had a traveling sound system called Desert Storm.  We are talking 7ft massive speaker stacks, a full sound board and decks.  Very minimal lights though, we wanted things dark.  The flat was perfect for it.  We set everything up Thursday night in the bedroom across from the front room and ran cables to the speakers.  This system kicked it, it was really impressive.  So we went out Friday and passed out a few flyers for a kind of test run on that Friday night.  We got probably 200 people to the flat.  We realized right away we needed to soundproof the front room as the windows were rattling.  So we took all the mattresses from the bedrooms (everyone had basically moved out at this point) and stuffed them into the window frames.  The party went over really well, the guys that had the sound system were also DJs and I knew a few around Edinburgh so the music was awesome as well.  We did have a couple of visits from the police, but they were just checking things out, there was no noise complaints (since this was not a residential area basically).  That said, we took steps to deter them by moving some large pieces of furniture by the door so they could not see what was going on and not open the door fully.  

So with out test run over, we prepared for that Saturday night.  I even got bacon and rolls for breakfast in the morning.  We are talking 150 bacon rolls.    I got several calls and visits from some of the top DJ talent in Edinburgh at the time asking to spin that night.  Even Mr EGG (EgeBamYasi) showed up with what he called his 'band in a box' and did a live set.  Now, I am not a promoter, I was just a punter that loved the scene and had the luck to get all these things together in one place.  The party on Saturday was out of hand.  Not in a bad way, but every room in the flat was packed, the floor in the front room was actually moving.  In hindsight, we are lucky it didn't collapse.  The party was a rousing success.  Really.  It went above any of our expectations and lasted till around 9am Sunday morning.  It would have gone longer, but we were worried about the sound on Sunday morning.  The Police did come 5 times that night, but every time they came, we turned down the music and they left.  They never came into the flat and we were always courteous to them.  

I could have made so much money charging for admission or taking a cut of the sales of party favors, but I wasn't in it for the money, I just wanted to throw a good party.  It was really an amazing thing and was the top point in my life up to that time.  But this party was not the party where I found myself being politely asked to leave the city/country.  It was because of this party that had very unique circumstances I thought that all parties would go this smoothly and successfully, no such luck in this case.

A few months later, I had moved to a flat on Melville Terrace (been living there since after we all left the party flat).  A great flat with great people.  Alan (the wise one and the oldest), Malcolm (a good friend that got me a room in the flat) and Ben.  There was another room as well, but people did come in and out of that one.  Anyway, my birthday was coming up and since the last party I had thrown was such a huge success, I figured I would throw another one.  But the situation was very different than the last time.  I actually lived in the flat we were going to have the party in and it was in a residential building.  Me, in my ultimate wisdom, went forward anyway.  I got a set of decks (a friend's), a sound system(another friend's), smoke machine and lights and made flyers up.  It was called the 'F*ck the Clubs' party.  

As it turned out, my Sister was visiting me.  She had never been out of the US before so this whole thing was freaking her out a bit.   I woke up that morning and had some breakfast which consisted of a line of speed, half an e and a spliff.  Some of the equipment had issues so I had to scamper around and get replacements.  But in the end, everything was set.  The people though did not 'Fuck the Clubs' as they figured that my party would go late (due to my last one as well as my lifestyle at that time).  So the party really didn't get cranking until around 3am.  The police also were so not fucking around this time.  They did come 4 times.  On the 5th time, it wasn't just one or two, it was 5 cops.  I opened the door and they immediately broke the chain and came barreling in.
Since this was a 'club' party, there were a ton of party favors flying around if you know what I mean.  I was always a big fan of weed as opposed to hash so people had given me several bags of it as birthday presents. It was my birthday after all and my lifestyle at that time was very different than it is now (you cannot continue in that lifestyle and stay alive I learned later).  So let's just say I was completely off my head.

 In addition to that, I had a multitude of other substances around my room, but luckily most of it was hidden.  The police busted in and they immediately started taking names.  I gave my name and when they asked for ID, I did not produce it as I was in the country illegally.  As it turned out, they had 3 cops surround me throwing questions while 2 searched my room in the flat.  This was the best case scenario as my roommates had a ton of gear so the police focusing on me was the best thing for the flat in general.  The police found the weed, and my expired passport.  Luckily nothing else.  I was arrested and taken to lockup to await an appointment with immigration. Again luck was on my side as I didn't have anything else on my person as I emptied my pockets at the jail.

My sister totally freaked out thinking I was going to prison.  I stayed in jail for around 36 hours until my appointment with the Immigration official.  Since I was not seriously seeing anyone and I knew that my name wasn't on any employment forms anywhere, I ended up spinning a yarn about living off a trust fund.  Total bullocks of course, I was completely independent as my family in the States were not well off in the least.  The Immigration official was a very polite Englishman, so he politely told me that I could not stay in the country and that he would give me 2 weeks to leave voluntarily.  He said I could appeal, but since I didn't have a serious girlfriend (found out later that several of my friends said that they would have married me to keep me in country, but it was too late at that point) and no 'roots' that I didn't have grounds to do so.

I was released and the next day the official came by the flat to have a look around.

I did leave Edinburgh and the UK at the end of that two weeks.  Those were a crazy two weeks though.  But that is another story for another time.  I have many stories of my time in Edinburgh (this isn't even the craziest), I think that time travelling was the most intense life I have ever experienced.

I came back to the USA, honestly, so lost.  I had such a close group of friends in Edinburgh and had intended on going back as soon as I could.  But since I was in the Detroit area, there were other parties to go to, other things to do and more people to meet.  It took me a little while to get into the scene, but I did and have some insane stories about that as well.

It's actually going to be really interesting to see what happens after IS.

Or captions of the total cost of our transfers and then cups won, when United, Spurs and until recently Arsenal have spent more or the same as us and haven't won anything either.

Maybe history will show that was the right choice (it's worth noting, as per your examples, that history is kicking the shit out of Kissinger and Nixon for secretly and illegally laying waste to Cambodia and Laos (all of which did nothing to advance America's position in the conflict) and Bush and Blair aren't exactly having an easy ride on having taken to l ultimately ineffective cross border potshots at Pakistan either.

- Make sure you are taking advantage of putting money into a tax free ISA if you don't have one already the current allowance is £15,240.

- Eventually try to ensure you have 1-3 months worth of wages saved up just in case you fall ill, lose your job, need to drop a lot of money on something etc.

- Ensure you're putting money into a pension fund now. They say you should ""*take the age you start your pension and halve it. Put this % of your pre-tax salary aside each year until you retire.*"" See [point 6](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/discount-pensions) on this list. For you that would be 13% which is a lot. I put 4-5% in mine and my employer puts in 4-5% too which they are now legally obliged to do I believe.

Some things I can highly recommend for your credit rating/score is the following:

1) Sign up to [Noddle](https://www.noddle.co.uk/), it's free and damn useful. Their home page has all the points you need to know. It also shows you how to improve your credit rating (e.g. make sure you are registered to vote at your current address aka Electoral Roll). I started at a rating of 3/5 and am currently at [4](http://i.imgur.com/6MZvaTo.png)/5. Was at 5/5 (the best) for a while but applied for a lot of stuff so it dropped down.

2) Get a 0% purchases credit card with the lowest limit you can (mine was £1500 starting out). Not to spend but to show you can be trusted with loaned money. Buy something cheap with it you know you can pay back and pay the money back straight away. This looks good to the banks. Cancel it before the 0% deal expires.

To answer your question, yes I watched every PL game last year. I'm not trying to knock Willian in any way. Even if we did sign another attack midfielder I would start Willian ahead of them in any big game. But take the match against QPR last season. We had only one shot on target. In a game like that the defensive work rate that Willian gives us is not as important compared to offensive production. We need a player who can give us that attacking spark off the bench when we are matched up against teams that are going to park the bus.

What other talk radio station does what Radio 4 does? LBC doesn't broadcast nationwide.

Maybe if the BBC were removed, another commercial broadcaster would step in to fill the gap, but I'm not convinced.

You refuse that treatment then, if it saves my life, my wife's, kids etc, then I'll happily take it, and your share.

&gt;Next is the argument that I eat meat, so how can I object to this? Yes I eat meat and yes I know the poor animals died. I have no excuse for this, but I do become more and more convinced each day that I should become a vegetarian. Would this change people's minds abut performing cruel tests on animals though? Probably not.

Whether or not the author eats meat is a personal choice, unfortunately choice isn't a luxury we have when it comes to animal testing, I'm sure the author would happily take the beagels spot though? 

&gt;I think the reason this bothers me most. My parents have a pet dog, a beagle in fact.

I am a primary teacher who has studied travelling communities. Any pupil that I have ever had that has identified as a traveller has also been ""pupil premium"". These children are considered to be from deprived backgrounds and hence have certain entitlements in school.

im not sure I can answer your question for you, but Irish travellers don't speak Romany in general, not even as broken slang. This leads me to believe that there is nothing Rom about them, and merely assumed the gypsy style of living some generations ago. 

A lot of it is down to genetics, and it is possible it seems to tell if someone is descended from Roma. I had to go to Harley Street Eye Clinic to have a ptosis examined and he knew I what I was by some kind of mark in my eye. I couldn't believe it. We also will generally have darker skin and dark hair due to originating in the Middle East, so having fair skin/hair/eyes also makes it seem less likely it's a racial thing with the Irish, at least where Roma are concerned.

The Tories' plans will remove this, making students go home more or less as soon as their studies are finished, which makes getting work and a working visa many times more difficult (as applying for a visa from outside the UK is more expensive and more difficult, employers need to prove that a non-EU worker is the only option for them, you have to completely end your life here, leave and then come back and restart it which is at best inconvenient and at worst impossible).

Given that some small aspects of liberalism have been adopted by parties all along the political spectrum, do you believe it will be harder for the Liberal Democrats to continue to clearly define ourselves the party of Liberalism and its values?

Finally, would a more radical approach serve to deal with this problem, if it is indeed a problem? For instance campaigning on a platform of drug decriminalisation or legalisation, or on a platform of far reaching decentralisation and possible federalisation of the UK, for example.

Also old Queen Liz’s dad was pro-fascist, that is a fact, and it’s not a secret. Doesn’t surprise me he egged the kids (aged around 7 at the time) on to do it given Hitler’s quirkiness,

In my experience, there's not much overlap between the properties of interest to owner-occupiers, and those sought by landlords:

Ex-council houses, flats over shops or in tower blocks, houses in shitty areas, properties with unusual construction... owner occupiers just don't aspire to live in these places, or simply cannot get mortgages for them. The competition for those properties is muted, so the prices are lower.

'Quite repellent'. Overdoing the offence meter aren't we?

I didn't suggest they lie. They would have to carry out the policies they promised in any manifesto. 

Unless you mean it's not what the party represents but that is also untrue. Everyone in New Labour was in fact Labour. There is a diverse range of views in the party and one faction of it is the centrist. You can look at the [Progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_\(organisation\)) organisation to see that this is an active and vocal part of the party. Their candidate in 2010 was David Miliband. This time it's Kendell but probably Yvette Cooper since the former is unlikely to get anywhere.

So I am far from suggesting they lie. I am suggesting they embrace the moderate wing of their party and remember that the last time they did this they won an election and as a result were able to introduce more Labour policies than any Government since Atlee led them in 1945.

null,false,Sir_Bantersaurus,null,null,null,"&gt; You're talking as if the electorate is like some sort of static mass, rather than people that can be convinced. What labour needs to do is actively campaign and educate the public now. So that it can convince the electorate that the left is a viable option, rather than adjusting its policies to suit a right wing electorate which has been subject to Tory propaganda.

I don't see what the left can do this time that they couldn't do for the last 70 years. The evidence shows the United Kingdom as a whole is a liberal but economically moderate country. Most people aren't like Reddit. They don't spend a lot of time debating political ideological or left vs right. They probably will not be receptive to arguments of sweeping ideological change. They want to know the economy will be well managed and that they'll have a job, healthcare and a decent school. 

I don't think Corbyn will have the economic credibility amongst middle England and a lot will be worried about their jobs and their tax bill. 

&gt; I highly doubt labour will win the next election regardless, however, I think they will have a far greater chance with Corbyn.

I predict now that if they elect Corbyn and lose it will be because 1) the tory media 2) he wasn't left wing enough. Never do the left ever accept failure is because people are rejecting their ideas.

Here you go:  “The number of properties coming to market is running at a weekly run-rate 10.6% below the same period in 2014. The biggest drop-off in fresh supply is in the typical first-time buyer sector with two bedrooms or fewer. The shortage of suitable property for sale highlights the need for an urgent and marked increase in the overall housing stock to help keep pace with the growth in household formation.”

Rightmove said there is a growing battle between first-time buyers and buy-to-let investors over the dwindling supply of two-bed flats and homes. Trevor Binch of Coventry estate agents Merrick Binch said: “We’re finding that any properties on the market with us at under £150,000 – so your typical two-beds or some three bed terraced – are selling immediately. There are a lot of investors snapping up these types of properties, and this, coupled with the fact that a lot of sellers aren’t coming to market, is making the supply shortage worse. While there are some new developments being built in Coventry, there just isn’t enough to satisfy the demand, especially at the lower end of the market.”

As far as I know there was interest from West Ham from the start. It was rejected because Coe et al made a decision that the bid would not include a football legacy for the stadium. Either because they thought the IOC would prefer an athletics only stadium post-Olympics or because they themselves didn't like the idea. That short-sightedness is the reason why the stadium is so expensive to convert. Nothing to do with a lack of interest from us.

Either of these moves would harm their programming, as the BBC has a guaranteed source of income they take programming risks with series and shows that other networks would reject as being too risky to take at the beginning. Yes, they make a crapload from things like Dr Who, but ITV make a lot from soaps like Emmerdale Farm or Coronation Street and they don't take the programming risks the BBC do.

So we'd be worse off in my opinion if either of these things happened. Personally I favour /u/How2999's idea of a tax - if it comes as part of your NI or Salary tax then it would likely only be a pound or two per person per year which would fund one of the greatest broadcasters of the world.

And politicians just love bad statistics, and journalists these days are too fucking ignorant to call them out.

If the ""weekend effect"" was related to staffing levels at the weekend, you'd expect deaths to peak at weekends, but they don't; the day of the week when most people die in NHS hospitals is Wednesday - as far from the weekend as it's possible to get. In other countries, they also observe a weekend effect, but they're actually done the research to try to work out what causes it, rather than merely using it as an election slogan.

We're behind Arsenal by a little and quite a lot behind Chelsea, City and United. We're spending quite a lot more than Spurs. We dwarf the remaining teams in the prem, the only teams we're not outspending 2:1 is Newcastle and QPR, and its close. Sadly, I dont know if the similar numbers are posted for other leagues. I do however imagine that the top CL clubs pay more than us, but we're still spending more than almost anyone else. 

Another thing to mention when it comes to Uniteds(and Real Madrids) spending in both wages and fees, is that they rake in the cash. United has a revenue of 100 million euros more than City, 130ish more than Chelsea, 160ish more than Arsenal and 200+ million more than us. Let me put it this way. Newcastle is closer to us in revenue, than we are to United. Newcastle...Its insane, and a perfect sign of why getting top 4 and actually playing in the CL, is not just about the money and pull of players. Success builds more success. Also, it will probably be huge for our revenue to expand Anfield, probably not as good as a brand new stadium, but having more tickets available will be a good investment.

""The cohort of patients admitted during the weekend will include those patients who would otherwise, had they been less ill, have had their admission postponed until a week-day.""

""An example of [a condition requiring prompt treatment] is fracture of neck of femur, for which is known that delay in treatment is associated with poorer outcomes.

Ours was finished and we were the second company in. 2 weeks later I pull up at 6am to see 4 caravans parked in our car park. They could have parked anywhere really, but chose the car park of the building with a sign up and obviously being used.

I go around back, open up and lock it. Ring up the company owner who was very displeased, even more so when I told him about our ‘visitors‘. 

I was told to assess the situation, so I did. I left at 7pm the night before and by 6am, less than 12 hours, they'd taken over and messed up the car park.

I am asked (ordered) to sort it. I go outside and the basics are that they are staying there...unless I make it worthwhile for them to move on. 5 grand, he says.

I relay this piece of menacing blackmail (which is what I'll always see it has) to my boss. After a few hours of talking to the police (sorry, can't do anything for you), negotiating etc I get it down to £1k if they leave that very day.

A manager comes down from the other depot with it in £5 notes (to make it seem bigger, I'm told) and I am given the task of tempting them out of the car park, whilst being threatened physical harm by them if I'm ‘tricking‘ them out of ‘their‘ site.

I manage to get them out whilst an employee parks a big forklift truck across the car park entrance. I give them the rest of the cash and they fuck off.

I survey the area and it looked like they'd been there for weeks. Rubbish, broken bikes and toys strewn about (it was also winter time, no light to play), bags of human shit. Had to be human because I neither saw nor heard any animals.

Within less than 24 hours they'd messed up the place, stopped a work days production...and got paid a grand for it.

It took another day to clean up, so nearly 2 days of production was lost.

Everton wouldn't agree to selling their starlet, just so he can be loaned back to them and get developed even more where he would become even better, especially seeing as they have him locked down in contract til 2019. And Stones himself wouldn't gain anything from this transfer as well, he would essentially be locking himself down to a contract with another team without even playing for them for an entire year and still after that year not knowing if he will ever be a starter.

He is indefinitely more talented than Lambert and Borini, probably even Ings too. Obviously he hasn't played well, although he improved with the rest of the squad after our horrible start. Remember Hendo? Hendo was shit when we got him. Hendo is older than Balotelli. 

Also, I think he has been exemplary off the pitch during his Liverpool stay. Theres not a single indication that he is disturbing the squad morale, actually I think its quite the opposite. That penno thing? I doubt that mattered to Hendo. The twitter thing? Ridiculous to punish the most racially abused player for racism when he tries to make a statement about not being racist and prejudice. 

One can argue about him nor working hard enough on the pitch etc. Thats the committees fault, and they just did it again with Benteke. And it doesn't matter. Its nice when you have Luis Suarez who is a monster defensively, you dont need it. And frankly, if Balotelli or Benteke scores goals, nobody on here will talk about them not working hard enough defensively.

Lastly and most importantly, anything regarding Balotelli leaving now, will be horrible business for Liverpool. His price literally cannot go any lower. We'll sell him for not even 25 % of what we payed and we'll have to continue paying 80% of his wages without having him. Would you take maybe 5m and 15-25k a week less wages to get rid of Balotelli? He is not a problem in the squad. We rolled the dice when signing him, lets not back out before the dice lands, because its looking like a loss. 

If Sampdoria offers 15+ mil and we can get Balotelli of our wage bill with a one time fee of 1-2 mil, sure lets get him off, but thats never gonna happen. 

If he becomes a problem, off with him to the reserves and give him away at the transfer window. Lets not speculate about something we know nothing about.

Only now is the media saying what the Lib Dems did in government, and people are starting to realise how much more dangerous the Conservatives are with a majority. With this, and Tim Farron's leadership, do you think that the Lib Dems may be able to regain, for example, 20 seats by 2020?

This is due to change in 2016 when a regulator will either be set up specifically for crypto currency or the FCA will take on this role.

Regulation is almost certainly guaranteed after the proposals announced at a previous budget.  Tax guidelines however are less certain.  There are several schools of thought and arguments on CGT and mining.  

The first is that as this is unregulated and 'unseen' at this stage by the Government, then any gains would not have to be declared.
The second is, even if they were to be declared, the actual gain would have to be calculated taking into account the time/electricity/equipment etc used and offset against the gain.
Another thought is, as CGT is not payable on something with a lifespan of 50 years or less (and it is impossible to know if BTC will still be around in 50 years) then that is some form of get out clause.  I think this is a weak argument though and not one to be relied on.

My personal opinion is that CGT does apply.  This is on the basis that if someone were using a metal detector and found gold, they would be liable for GCT.  Strange analogy but the closest I could think of.

You wouldn't need do that though, you can cook up a huge batch of beans then freeze them down in batches.

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"So in order:

* Ireland: 1.088 per million people
* UK: 1.7 deaths per million people
* Netherlands: 11.9 deaths per million people

That's of limited use since we don't have a proportionate number of cyclists. ""Deaths per miles travelled"" would probably be a more useful statistic, but it does show that the idea of the Netherlands being a cyclist's paradise is somewhat more nuanced than are often led to believe.

I think there is a case to be made for better driver education, and also for better cycling infrastructure. A cycle lane 30cm wide that cuts up onto a pavement and is then obstructed by a signpost is not worth laying out in the first place ""look at us, cycle friendly"" claims the council. ""No, a cheap green-washing exercise"" say everyone else.  New road layouts need cycle lanes designed in from the outset, and no less convenient than the road route itself. Ideally, entirely separating the cycles from motor traffic.

Equally however, cyclists need educating. Do not fucking filter down the left hand side of an HGV at traffic lights. Anyone who has observed an HGV *knows* the rear wheels take a tighter circle than the front. There's a ""dual carriageway"" roundabout near me - two lanes on and off. It's a bit small for the purpose though, and so even as a driver, if I am in Lane 2 and an HGV is on the outside in Lane 1, I will hang back and let him go, because I know he'll pinch my lane when he makes his turn. That's as a car driver - the infinitely more vulnerable cyclist needs to make similar allowances when cycling in the vicinity of HGVs.

Like the OP, I used to live - and cycle - in Southampton. Getting down to the docks in the morning, I used to cycle straight down Above Bar Street/the High Street. Illegal? Technically yes, but at 8am, the drivers in the heavy traffic rarely respected the narrow cycle lanes (and headed to the docks inherently meant you were playing with lots of HGVs). By contrast the retail areas were dead - staff might get into the majority of shops and banks by 9, for a 9.30 opening. At 8am, you can whizz through without seeing a soul. It was the pragmatic and sensible option for the cyclist who valued their life.

This is no different to maritime rules - ostensibly power gives way to sail, because powered vessels are more controllable.

But yacht still damn well gives way to super-tankers - because they're more manoeuvrable than a powered vessel *with a stopping distance measured in miles*.

That's not to say that HGV drivers shouldn't be diligent in checking their blind spots, but you wouldn't go and stand right behind a car that has its reversing lights on, because that would be idiotic, and you wouldn't sail in front of a super-tanker smugly proclaiming ""No - you stop, power gives way to sail!"", because with the best will in the world they can't - simple as.

Similarly, don't cycle into the blind spots or pinch-zones on HGVs, because (shock horror!) you might get blind-sided or pinched.",null,0,null,1437386486,null,0,1437387529,0,ct9jkto,null,t3_3dvgxt,null,t1_ct9jkto,null,t1_ct953p8,null,null,null,1438019357,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

All anecdotal, but I used to work in a call centre (which was fucking horrific), they paid minimum wage and had very strict working conditions. Everything was monitored, from toilet breaks to lunchtimes - you had to be exactly 30 minutes from logging out to logging back in and taking a call. Call times, call notes, everything was overbearingly monitored. With the best will in the world, they just didn't pay people enough who were either good enough (it was tech desk) or willing to put up with that, as soon as people could leave they did immediately. So they would have a new influx every few weeks who were trained for two weeks (paid) then who were pretty terrible for at least the first month until they learnt the ropes. They may have had less than 10 minutes in the toilet each day but they couldn't sort out a customer's broadband connection! The cycle then repeated, many dropped out after a week, or even just after training. 

Then compare to another job where they had a round of redundancies including a twat of a manager also obsessed with stats and targets.

Better awareness for ALL road users is always good, but your post comes across as unnecessary and accusing. I mean, look at your title, ""... and is doing its best to sweep it under the carpet"" makes it sound like UK drivers are naughty children running over cyclists willy nilly, when in fact I bet the majority of people take road safety and collisions very seriously. Which is why the national statistics show *decreasing* collision figures.

I agree on the point that we need better cyclist infrastructure, but it's equally frustrating when I see SOME cyclists continuing to cycle on the road when there's a perfectly good bike path on the pavement, or not stopping at red lights. A lot of drivers see this and suffer from confirmation bias, every time they see it happen it reinforces their notion that *all* cyclists do that.

If Siddique was merely a devoted Muslim believer in his personal life, and his professional life was unrelated to that (say, he was a personal fitness trainer, or advising the government on business policy), I very much doubt his personal religious beliefs would get, or warrant, a mention (and rightly so).

But he has held two ""professional Muslim"" roles. If a priest, vicar, bishop, Spiritual Peer ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_Spiritual ) etc. was being charged with a serious offence, I would expect their religious beliefs to warrant a mention too.

So it's not the fact that Islam plays a major role in his life, but that it plays a major role in his *professional* life that warrants the mention.

The main issue is that if you are married, you have to obtain your spouse's permission to obtain a Gender Recognition Certificate (which alters your legal gender and grants various legal protections).  That made sense when a GRC meant automatic divorce, but now it has no real impact on your spouse.  Since coming out as trans quite often leads to relationship breakdown, the worry is that some people might decide to hold their spouse's legal gender to ransom during the divorce process.  The government was really determined to keep the ""spousal veto"" in place but didn't really offer any justification.

&gt; Not much wrong with that.

Homophobia motivated by religion is no less harmful than the other kind, so why is it any more deserving of respect?

Argh.  Nobody's saying that.  Cameron isn't asking Muslims to apologize for extremism -- I'm sure he already knows that many many Muslims have openly denounced Isis.

What he's asking is for British muslims to make more of an effort to get their own house in order.  Is that *really* so unreasonable?

null,false,gamas,null,null,null,"&gt; Sincere question: don't they already have that right anyway?

It is argued that the ""spousal veto"", which states that if one partner applies for a gender recognition certification, the spouse must give permission for the marriage to continue. This is considered discriminatory as it effectively creates a barrier for those seeking gender recognition by effectively having to seek permission to change gender.

The government's justification for this ""this is necessary as it would be unfair to the spouses of transgender people for their marital status to be to be changed to a same sex marriage without their specific consent."" (even though same sex and different sex marriage are supposed to be the same in the eyes of the law but whatever...).

Of course, some would argue this shouldn't be a problem - you need to have transitioned for 2 years before you can apply for a gender recognition certificate, so if the spouse wasn't okay with it, that issue would have been sorted by then... However, the argument is that it is about the principle - the statement that the spouse has more say over the status of the marriage than the transgender person.

On an aside, trans folk (quite rightly) take issue with the legal requirement to disclose their gender history to potential spouses else it is considered ""sex by deception"". Whilst obviously relationships are built on trust, the trans community believe that it should ultimately be up to the person to decide how much of their history they would like to disclose with the people they are sleeping with, and that this is similar to racial purity laws in Nazi Germany (which required a spouse to disclose their full family history in order to get married).

tl;dr The remaining issues are essentially about recognising that a transgender person is a person with self-autonomy and that their spouse shouldn't have more say over their relationship than they do.",null,0,null,1437388611,null,0,false,0,ct9k31q,null,t3_3dx5rr,null,t1_ct9k31q,null,t1_ct9hy43,null,null,null,1438019657,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

By October 2018 and onwards the minimum employee contribution will be 4%, minimum employer contribution will be 3% with grossing up of contributions by the tax man adding another 1% for a total of 8% of qualifying earnings. Qualifying earning is income between £5,772 and £41,865.

So someone on £24,000 would get total contributions of £1,458.24 per year which is only actually 6.1% of their gross income. The current legal minimums are even less than this but will move upwards over the next few years. Some employers obviously choose to be more generous.

Given the rule of thumb one might want to make extra contributions to make up the percentage. However as with all rules of thumb its always worth trying to take a deeper look at the figures (e.g. when do you want to retire, how much to you to spend in retirement, what is the salary progression in your chosen career etc).",null,0,null,1437388694,null,0,false,0,ct9k3ts,null,t3_3dwj5s,null,t1_ct9k3ts,null,t1_ct9dre8,null,null,null,1438019669,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

So, if Doctors can't opt out of weekends, what's being changed here? Is it that major operations and such will be carried out at the weekends or what? I'm struggling to understand this, if doctors already work weekends then what would the complaint about a 7 day NHS be, and if not, well, it's something that seems kind of logical that that would change.

And yeah, I dig the statistic, makes perfect sense. If all the operations you do are on emergency heart surgery and not on knee operations and removing old Aunt Gretta's mystery back growth then you're more likely be shortly reincarnated in the form of someone else's liver.

If you're talking about the same staffing levels though, and the same level of patients, how does this spread the jam more thinly, rather than just more evenly?

null,false,the_ultravixens,null,null,null,"&gt;  What you've outlined is an engineering issue. Not a straightforward one but entirely tractable. 

Nuclear fusion and getting a man on Mars are also ""engineering issues"".  Fact is modern electrical grids currently can't support much more than about 50% of their total instantaneous demand from variable renewables, for reasons of stability (the Irish grid is instructive here, as they're basically an island grid).  Germany and Denmark are interconnected out the bazoo, which helps them, but their wind output is highly correlated which means that their near neighbours can't build too much extra wind, or else their interconnectors would become useless.  Again, the system level here is what's important, not the individual nation state level.  As for us exporting, we'd need to build something like 40GW of interconnectors to be as interconnected as Denmark is, proportionally, which is *not* happening due to the expense, and fact that suhc interconnection probably wouldn't be profitable.

Anyway, if you go and look at [hourly output](http://www.pfbach.dk/) for wind in the UK and denmark, then over 2014 I calculate a correlation coefficient of 0.48.  That's a high correlation, which means that when we have too much wind and want to export, they probably do too.  Furthermore, if you look at wind output aggregated over Europe then it's still incredibly variable.  The 'wind always blows somewhere' argument is very simplistic, and doesn't fit with operational reality.

I'm not 'giving up' on renewables in the slightest.  I'm just saying that there are very real difficulties around large-scale grid integration of variable sources, and that realisitcally our expectations should be set much lower than they currently are.",null,0,null,1437388780,null,0,false,0,ct9k4ja,null,t3_3dmsad,null,t1_ct9k4ja,null,t1_ct7jre1,null,null,null,1438019692,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

secondly, i think one should worry about corporations paying their fair share of taxes, before working themselves into a tizzy, over the relative drop in the ocean, gypsy/travellers may or may not be paying. there maybe reason to legitimately dislike those cultures, and it's understandable if they are disrupting your life in some way for you to feel negatively about them, but their level of tax contributions seems an insignificant one to me. big picture, they really don't have any significant impact on a national scale and i believe their way of life is dying out by itself.

They say to call 111 before you go to A&amp;E but since my local surgery is closed at weekends, A&amp;E is literally the only walk-in medical facility local to us. The GP used to have locums in at the weekend for minor ailments, everything up to minor stitches/steri-strips, etc.

They complained bitterly about how much it costed to bring in locums, to which my response would be - each partner works 1 weekend each month. Doesn't seem unreasonable for £100k/yr. I get £25k for a 40 hour week - will quite happily do 1 weekend/month for another £75K!

null,false,cbfw86,,Corbyn for Leader of the Opposition,null,"&gt; It is argued that the ""spousal veto"", which states that if one partner applies for a gender recognition certification, the spouse must give permission for the marriage to continue.

Surely that

a) protects the spouse of the transgender person, and   
b) speeds up the divorce process.

If a man turns around and says that they've secretly always been a woman, why should the wife be forced to remain in the marriage to someone they might well feel they no longer know (and may never have really known, thus rendering the entire marriage a lie)? Additionally, why should the wife have to go through conventional divorce proceedings which are laborious and difficult enough as it is?

In essence, the spouse already has a say in whether the marriage is allowed to continue. Why nullify the quick-win option?

&gt;This is considered discriminatory as it effectively creates a barrier for those seeking gender recognition by effectively having to seek permission to change gender.

I don't see how that's the case. If a man gets a sex change and it's likely that the spouse will trigger a divorce, then it's pretty obvious from the get-go that he's going to have to choose whether he wants to end his marriage anyway.

&gt;On an aside, trans folk (quite rightly) take issue with the legal requirement to disclose their gender history to potential spouses else it is considered ""sex by deception"".

Here I disagree. People should have the right to know the sexual history of a potential spouse.

This right here is where I get tired of the LGBT-plus lobby. Other people have rights as well, as well as their own emotional, mental, and spiritual health. You can't dupe someone into having sex with you and then have them find out years later that you were born a guy.

That's exactly my point.

The distinctions are so unclear. I personally believe ISIS are more immoral than the US troops or British troops or the IRA as I see the forced spread of ISLAM as an unjust cause but I see fighting to get an imposing and often violent foreign army out of a country is closer to being a just cause. You can't say one group of people are terrorists for bombing, but when people question the fact that your side bomb as well it is swept away because it was the 'right cause', when everyone's perception of the right cause differs. That's why I never use the word terrorist. ISIS are a bunch of people who I have no sympathy for their cause and hatred of their actions, but I won't call them a terrorist until there is an international consensus on what a terrorist is, and it is applied universally to all causes and nations based on actions and not ideologies.

Last point. From personal experience and from talking to CTC lawyers that doesnt happen. Car insurers fight tooth and nail not to pay out. The rider has to prove the insurer's client was at fault (kind of a reverse presumed liability in reality) as I did when I was hit.

The initial consulation will mostly consist of irrelevant questions about smoking habits (they probably get a payment for ""patient surveys""), and the doctor will probably have no understanding of the patient's condition on first visit, and very little on subsequent ones unless they could be bothered to google it.

I'm sure there are competent and caring GPs but outside of social occasions I have yet to encounter one. Their receptionists are generally worse.

Okay, my snarkiness aside, this article is so facile as to be unreal. Every leader offers 'hope', the idea that things can change for the better. That's the very essence of being leader of a party. Neil Kinnock offered 'hope' in 1992. Where did that get him? The SDP/Liberal Alliance offered the 'hope' that they could break the mold of two-party politics and overtake one or both of the two main parties. Did that work?

'Hope' doesn't mean anything in politics. It certainly doesn't pay the bills. Giving me a list of things that, duh, Guardian readers support, and that the general public might also support, according to someone (Zoe Williams, in this case) gets us nowhere. It is a well-established fact that parties can offer things the public 'supports' and still lose elections. In 2005, the Tories' whole platform was made up of things the public 'supported' and the Conservatives still lost. In 2010, we put forward lots of policies the public 'supported' and we still lost. Anyone who is claiming to write serious political commentary while simply ignoring this is indulging in wishful thinking, not 'hope'.

Personally, I think that the current motorcycle restriction be reverted to its previous format. Keep A2/A, but have a time-limited period on A2; not a retest like we have now. 

I don't see why I need to take a test again just to ride a larger machine, when the machine I take my full A test on is likely to be very very similar to my currently restricted one. Under test conditions, I struggle to understand the difference between the A2 and A test. The format is the same - you won't be taking a bigger bike faster or accelerating quicker, the bikes are and feel (more or less) the same if you've ridden a larger A2 bike - it doesn't demonstrate anything other than you are still safe and competent on the road, two years after having passed A2. If you have a restricted 600 or similar four cylinder bike, then taking the full A on an unrestricted version is likely not going to be a whole world of difference. Of course if you take your A on a litre bike having only owned a Ninja 250, then you will have a pleasant surprise but I don't know of any schools that offer R1s for the full A...

But what if you're not still safe? You don't loose your A2 license - you're still free to go having failed the full A test and can still cause havoc on the road - so that's a bit silly really. You're not gaining another license - you already have that - you're just gaining another endorsement and ultimately, that's what I think it boils down to. You've got your license, you've proven your metal, so why do you need to go through the rigmarole of doing it again?

It wasn't actually a nerve issue in my spine. One of my iliac/psoas/piriformis muscle(s) started letting go, just ripping off the bones in my pelvis and pulling the others off with it.

Which was painful but that letting go also caused pinching of nerves in my pelvic area and causing even more pain. Every now and again a perfect storm of swelling and body positioning would happen and that's when I'd get the electric shocks go up the back.

Unfortunately, even though I told the doctors about it, they never looked at that area of my body. They focused more on the spine, and so everything had fixed itself (badly) by the time they finally listened to me and started looking at the pelvis area.

From what I can read the statement that Hunt made involved two things, one is that all doctors should be made to work on weekends, the other is that he seems to be backing it up with stats saying people are more likely to die if admitted on weekends.  Now people and doctors are livid about it.  I can't understand about what exactly.  If doctors are already working weekends why is making it policy that they should working weekends such an issue?  I can only think of a few possible explanations, one could be that they are all working weekends and they are upset that it seems like government either doesn't know about it or want to create a perception that they don't.  I could understand that but it doesn't square with my experience of family members with serious illnesses over the past few years and who were admitted on weekends.  Weekends were certainly worse, diagnoses and treatment and feedback from the doctor was almost always having to wait until Monday.  In one case a significant mistake was made over a weekend and only picked up on Monday when a doctor was involved.  To me the statistics of more deaths over a weekend sounds about right.  Perhaps most doctors do work on the weekends in many areas, but not in all areas?  Perhaps emergency workload on the weekend is so much higher that doctors don't get involved as much with anything else? Perhaps it's down to services like pathology that's not operating on the weekends?  Perhaps it's because many doctors are working 'over the phone' so don't have access to all the details until they are back in hospital?  It doesn't make sense and I don't see the rants from doctors themselves giving any clues either.",null,0,null,1437390591,null,0,false,0,ct9kl66,null,t3_3dvr9x,null,t1_ct9kl66,null,t3_3dvr9x,null,null,null,1438020070,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

How does this work though? I mean, it's not like this is going to increase the NHS workload by 40%, it's not adding extra patients, it's just treating people for more things on more days.

I do get what you're saying, and it does seem like we need more clinical staff for the NHS then we currently have.

&gt;Also, from the GP practices that have opened up weekend appointments - people apparently are more likely to not attend their appointments on weekends.

Which makes sense when I think about it, although I still think GP's should most definitely be open on the weekends, as it must be very tough for 9-5 people to attend regular doctors appointments, and certainly I would put off going to the GP for minor but real stuff if I had to take time off work to go.

A clinical psychologist (NHS) I once discussed this particular issue with was quite enthusiastic about the idea of charging people for *not* showing up to appointments without cancelling, since he said up to one quarter of all appointments in his department/hospital (can't remember which) were missed without good reason. This actually strikes me as being a very good idea, since you're not charging people for access to care, you're not charging people for being too ill or whatever to attend even, you're just charging people if the clinician is left sitting there twiddling his/her thumbs because you can't be bothered to ring up and say ""I won't be there"".",null,0,null,1437390998,null,0,false,0,ct9kp16,null,t3_3dvr9x,null,t1_ct9kp16,null,t1_ct9kj0t,null,null,null,1438020159,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Also don't think I missed your condescension; what are we doing with those sections of society? I've already suggested that cyclists should be tested on some rudimentary knowledge of traffic law before they're allowed to cycle on public roads. At the moment, with the lack of a licence, cyclists who are penalised only incur the fine, not the points as they don't have a licence. So there is no real way to stop them from continuing to cycle unacceptably.

First of all - so nobody's confused - that's my phrasing, not Cameron's.  But, is it 'blaming ordinary muslims' to say that?  I don't think so and that's certainly not what I would want to see happen.  

However, I think there's a reasonable expectation that if people voluntarily join a particular group, *of any kind*, and that group starts causing significant problems for others, then that group's members have some responsibility to clean up.  And, honestly, I don't find it good enough for the individual members to complain that 'it's not me' who did the bad things.  

I guess if I had to write a rule, it would go something like this:

&gt;To the extent that people support a group and see themselves as members of a collective, these people have a responsibility to make sure that their group is not causing harm.

Claimed over £1 million in EU farming subsidies or welfare while preaching about the corrosive power of welfare. 

Refused to access EU funds to help pay for food at foodbanks.

Has cost the taxpayer over £300 *million* and still counting, for his disastrous and unworkable universal credit, refuses to accept advice that it is impossible and keeps claiming it is coming (it's not)wasting more money on development.

Claimed £100 for some wet wipes

Claimed £39 for a breakfast.

Had his parliamentary credit card cancelled for payment irregularities.

Claimed the best way to end child poverty was through work. Rewrites definition of child poverty when commissioners of the UK tell him child poverty is increasing.

Brought in the much despised workfare scheme which forces people to work for JSA or less than minimum wage in jobs that would otherwise be filled by fully paid employees.

Retroactively changed the law when he lost a court case against a teenage student that was forced to volunteer at pound land when she already had volunteer work at a museum. 

Brought in sanctions of 3 weeks, 3 months and 3 years which has contributed massively to foodbank usage and malnutrition. Without foodbanks crime would be spiralling and people dying of starvation. 

Thinks of joblessness as a mental condition that needs to be modified by harsh practices at job centres. (Doesn't matter what your taxes have paid for.)

Wow, I'm looking forward to his leadership. He says something, the entire PLP ignore him, he shrugs and says 'Hey, that's cool, guys, I'm against the concept of ~~party unity~~ the Whip!' Immediately, Labour win a landslide under someone who refuses to actually win a majority of his own PLP, never mind the Commons.

Ed did not maintain the status quo. The whole point of his candidacy was 'I won't maintain the status quo'. Let's just get that one out of the way, first, yeah? He explicitly repudiated much of the Blair years.

Stop saying 'optimism' and 'hope'. I cannot just shrug my shoulders and go, 'Hey, this guy's intent on destroying the party, as far as I'm concerned, but let's be optimistic!' I'm hopeful that Yvette Cooper can win the leadership, and thence the election by offering something the public can actually agree with. There's my hope.

This is routine work.  Not emergency.  If you start asking doctors to work on Sat and Sun for non emergency work, then you will need to give them time off during the week, nobody is forced to work 7 days a week without a break.  

Traditionally people in this country get saturday and sunday off, so why change it so doctors work saturday and sunday but not wednesday and friday?

worst case scenario, you call the three companies and explain the situation, see if the guy is registered with them.

If you do want to do something adventurous you could take up [skydiving](http://ukskydiving.com/) It's expensive initially then costs come down once you have a licence, it's a pretty good sport if you don't mind hanging out at drop zones on your weekend and once a month is enough to keep yourself current.

* You pretty much have to contact each of the three schemes to find out which holds your deposit. If it was held by one of them you negotiate through the scheme itself.

* If it wasn't held in a scheme as required you have to take them to court. Finding the details of the owner of the property should be made easier by the [Land Registry](https://www.gov.uk/get-information-about-property-and-land/search-the-register) and/or the tenancy agreement (TDP details are usually kept with the AST but it sounds like they aren't in this case).

Either way: document everything that has happened so far. Write down who you spoke to, when you spoke to them and provide records where possible. Luckily communication so far has been by email which is helpful. If you speak to someone either record it or make contemporaneous records. Do this going forwards.

If they didn't protect the deposit and they dick around (which it sounds like they might be doing) the courts can order the landlord to pay up to three times the deposit (£2,100). Actually collecting any of this money is another matter.

Edit:
&gt; * If you don’t know who your landlord is, write to the person or company you pay rent to. Your landlord can be fined if they don’t give you this information within 21 days.
&gt; * Contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if your landlord lives outside the UK and you pay £100 or more a week in rent directly to them.

Nobody needs to wait 2 days over the weekend for hospital care - either you need to be in hospital so you go to A&amp;E or be admitted directly, or you don't and you can wait to see your GP or phone your hospital consultants secretary and get an urgent appointment, most of them will phone you back if they think they can help over the phone.

Yes you could get treatment without taking time off work,  so doing day-case surgery on a weekend could be a good idea, except most operations would normally include a period of time off work anyway afterwards, so its pretty small numbers of people actually will benefit from this.

If you pay any attention to the media and what people say, other than saying we are not ""economically credible"" they say we are excessively authoritarian. What message does it send to the public when we say ""hey we know the 300,000 members and supporters voted this guy by democratic majority, but screw this, those members and supporters are morons"". 

The ""bigot"" moment in the 2010 campaign was so huge, not because the majority of people agreed with the woman's views, but because it highlighted to the people that Labour are a party whose elected representatives think of their electorate with nothing more than utter discontent. Same when we chose to go to war in Iraq despite the majority of the population being against it.

For a decade, Labour has been seen as the party that has absolutely no respect for the people who vote for it, and that is why people have moved away from them. And here we are, members are voting for the leader they want in the Labour party, and MPs are talking about overruling that choice - great to see we understand our electorate! The PLP need to realise they represent their voters, if the majority of those voters want Corbyn, then they should adapt to that, not stamp their feet and say ""no fuck you, you're all morons who don't Labour to be electable"".

If Labour didn't want the possibility of a left-wing candidate being a leader, why bother holding a leadership election in the first place. Ed Miliband should have just appointed the next Labour leader when he stood down if this leadership contest wasn't about picking the person who best represents the members.

HMRC often alter the soft rules around what CT applies to as a means of compensating for the headline rate reduction.

There are countless people out there who simply do not believe that biological sex is a feeling or a choice, and those people in particular would struggle to come to terms with why they were lied to. I would imagine most people would. People should have a right to know if the sex partner has had a sex change in the past. The emotional and mental fallout of ""sex by deception"" should not be taken lightly, nor should it be trumped by the right ('right') of trans people to deny their own past.

(Yeah, I watch *The Good Wife*. It's a great show. Alan Cummings is in it)

She is, in other words, insisting on the principle of charity while not herself holding to it.

The other problem with this is that she's ignoring the fact that we are having a *leadership* debate, not a debate about politics. If we were debating the merits of, e.g., unilateral nuclear disarmament *in and of itself*, then saying, 'The public don't like it' would be irrelevant.

But that's not what we're debating: We're debating who should lead the party, and if we think one particular leader will be bad at leading the party, and we agree on some definitions of bad (among which would probably be '*In my opinion*, X is unelectable'), there's no reason we can't use them in the debate.

Furthermore, as I've pointed out before, the likelihood that the election of either Kendall or Corbyn might well cause large numbers of people, including, perhaps, members of the PLP, to leave the party, is a valid part of the discussion.

You keep using the term 'respectful' but James is clearly biting his tongue here and if he could he would give a middle finger to everyone in the crowd. Simply because if can claim ""his people"" in reference to an event that happened before his time then every english person in England can claim offence at his refusal to acknowledge the sacrifice of their grandparents during two world wars. 

As the guy at the top of this comment chain said about his wages.

Personally I don't think atheists can be reasonably held responsible for atrocities they did not commit and rightly reject, but you say yourself that it's ""(not ) good enough for the individual members to complain that 'it's not me' who did the bad things.""",null,1,null,1437393233,null,0,false,0,ct9lcxx,null,t3_3dxgak,null,t1_ct9lcxx,null,t1_ct9l40q,null,null,null,1438020694,null,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3,null

null,false,Help-desk-slave,null,null,null,"&gt; What specifically do average Muslims need to do?

There seems to be worrying number of British Muslims leaving this country to join ISIS. A group of people responsible for numerous atrocities and human rights abuses. Some of the people who are leaving are children or young teens.
 
These people (especially the younger one) aren't waking up one morning and deciding to leave and join a terror group. They'll have been groomed and influenced over a number of weeks/months/years even into believing that it's a good opportunity.

This influence clearly isn't coming from outside the British Muslim population. There are no British Atheists, or Christians, or Sikhs preaching for Muslims to go join the Jihad in Syria. It's not John Smith down the pub who's telling them it's a good idea to die for Allah.

No, the influence is coming from within their own communities. Whether it's at home, at the local Mosque, their radical friends at work, or whatever. Islamic extremism isn't a global problem with Islam, it's a problem *within* Islam. There's a small percentage of Muslims in the community that are propagating this dangerous world view.

When people say ""the good Muslims need to do something about this"", we're not saying they should apologies for the actions of a few bad apples. We're saying that Muslim community leaders need to try and tackle this issue of extremism within their own ranks. Spiritual leaders need to be actively speaking out against it at their services. People in the community need to report extremism to the authorities when they encounter it. Parents need to educate their children about the dangers of meeting people who hold such views, in the same way you'd educate your children against meeting strangers online.

Nobody is blaming the good Muslims, who represent the majority of Islam's followers. We just acknowledge that if we're to tackle the issue of Islamic extremism, the solution needs to come from within.

Doctors can, do, and will make mistakes but that doesn't mean they aren't qualified to give medical advice or that they don't know what they are talking about. However this show had people time and time again disparaging Doctors and Nurses for assuming they know better. The presenter said that 'ultimately their diagnosis/advice is just an opinion'. A guy who phoned up and said that these 'white-collar' professionals are arrogant and who are they to tell patients that they're overweight or that they should exercise , apparently it's because they just love to judge people. 

The famous 'so-called experts' was trotted out by pretty much every caller too. The presenter joked and laughed about the authority these people get because of the word 'Doctor' (might have been professor). 

No one seemed to call in and suggest the reason why they feel qualified to give medical advice and do so it's because 1) they are qualified 2) it's their job. 7 years of medical school and more. 7 years of medical training vs the callers' knowledge of fuck-all.

The guy is 20 years old.

He's coming off a crazy world cup and transfer that would affect any teenager. Then after signing for Liverpool gets sent back to Lille were he gets a lot of pressure and expectation heaped on him to be the main man after the world cup. 

A few bad performance because he's young and still learning and the manager comes out and says his head isn't there he's already at Liverpool and the fans slate him. Which is bound to move his head to Liverpool more and reek havoc on his game and development.

AFAIK all the schemes have some kind of search facility which will allow you to search by tenant name and address.

If the deposit wasn't protected when it should've been then potentially you could sue for compensation over and above the amount of the deposit (I think; a tenant or ex-tenant certainly can and I assume  this right is also available to the estate of a deceased tenant).

I think what has happened here is Mr Hunt has gone and made a statement bashing the professionals who actually run the health service, as in provide the services that he oversees, and it has been taken very personally.


If he truly wants 7 day working, including covering elective/non emergency stuff, then that is great.  But actually it seems more of a move to try and turn public support against Consultants so he can mess with their contracts and have the public support him.

Also if the NHS is to become 7 days a week, then it will mean needing more of every grade of doctor.  I work 60 hours a week at the moment, which is more than the 48 hour week limit, but balanced by times when I don't cover emergency work and it goes  to 40 hours a week.

If the general wards and clinics were to be fully staffed then that would mean even on a 'non rota' job, I would be working 56 hours a week.    Now obviously that wouldn't be the case, it would need to be a post thats filled by 2 doctors working to cover the whole 7 days;  but there is the problem;  that means training more doctors.  Can't just hire them out of a pool of unemployed,  theres 7000 of us that qualify each year and 7000 jobs for us to go into.  If you do the maths and figure you need an extra 2000 doctors to cover this 7 day plan, then you gotta get 2000 more places at medical schools.  Oh, and wait 5 years for the new ones to train.

Repeat that, but with 15-20 years to train a new consultant from scratch to work these extra days.

That is the crux of it,  I object to being asked to work more than I already am.  Not because I don't care about my job, but I also have a life to lead, just like my patients.  

  If this change is forced on us like Hunt is threatening, then senior doctors will quite possibly exercise their option of simply retiring.  Younger doctors like me also have an option which I have heard a lot over the last few days,  just emigrate to a country where we feel more wanted.   Might seem a bit extreme, but thats a mark of how much he has riled up the profession

That might seem immature, 'i don't like it so i'm leaving', but it is 40 years of my life I am thinking about.

No. Since I was clearly talking about ""deaths"" not death rate, or subsequent death rate among admissions, admissions are irrelevant. More people die in hospitals on Wednesday than on Saturday or Sunday. I'm talking *volume* not rate. Its arguable that that peak could be explained by more people being in hospital on a Wednesday than other days, but the death *rate* is also higher on a Wednesday.

From the study linked elsewhere...

&gt;Conclusions Admission at the weekend is associated with increased
risk of subsequent death within 30 days of admission. The likelihood of death actually occurring is less on a weekend day than on a mid-week day

null,false,Anandya,null,null,null,"Here are the ACTUAL conclusions for those who are reading... 

1. Patients admitted on a Sunday were more likely to die over the next thirty days than a similar cohort of admissions on Wednesday- the ratio was 1.16 and the result significant, suggesting a true result of increased deaths by 16%

2. 94% of these ‘admissions’ were emergencies 

3. 34% of deaths occurred within three days of admission

4. You are actually less likely to die if you are IN hospital on the weekend – the Sunday to Wednesday ratio here is 0.92, or 8% LESS likely. As the authors also conclude, this likely reflects the fact that high-risk, non-urgent procedures are performed during the week.

When doctors don't work there is an initial drop in mortality. However eventually it will spike. The reason is surgeries. A lot of surgery is not ViTAL and is mainly for quality of life. Let's take a fractured arm. You don't NEED surgery as much as people think they do. However in the UK we play it safe. Why? Because we think this would cause more distress for the patient [NSFW guy with a non-union fracture of humerus creating a false joint https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQfNKXr3A8] Kids. This is why you see a doctor. Now here is the thing. Do you take the small risk of death vs the large risk of looking like this or not? 

However the people who TEND to come in on the weekend are generally emergencies. Your heart attacks, your asthma attacks. If people fall ill during the week they tend to come in if they don't get better too. So your pneumonias and the like. 

5. For elective (non-emergency) admissions, the ratio was 1.62 for Sunday to Wednesday, suggesting a 62% increased chance of death. This, as the authors conclude, is likely biased by the fact that high-risk elective patients are brought in early in general for exactly this reason, therefore this is unlikely to be significant.

6. Of 10 conditions specifically looked at, only 7 were found to show the same increased risk: sepsis, acute renal failure, cancer of the bronchus or lung, myocardial infarction, acute  stroke, and congestive heart failure.
The authors also conclude: “7-day access to ALL ASPECTS of care” could improve such figures, but further ‘economic evaluation’ is required to ensure efficiency with ‘scant resources’ 

What Mr. Hunt would like us to believe is 7-Day access to ALL aspects of care would improve this. Fuck no. There is no damn point in bringing in dermatologists on the weekend. No one's ever died from a critical dermatological condition (burns are treated by different fields such as surgical) that I can think of. No one's ever died of acne despite what teenagers will insist. 

The problem is we have shortages in critical care. The main reason is that it has unsocial working hours and the same pay as social working hours. So you eventually just give up? How many of your children's milestones must you miss. How many relationships. Hell? I am dating another doctor and even with her tolerance for bullshit hours I still manage to fuck up a lot because of the hours. It's sacrifice. No one ever mentions how many of your kids events you miss. My mother was a surgeon. To put it into perspective? I hold 3 degrees. My parents never came for one because they couldn't take time off. When I played sports, my parents never dropped me. And with a modern NHS we doctors WANT a better work life balance cause frankly I don't want to die alone aged 60 while my patients live longer and have happier lives. We want some of that happiness too. 

However we do have critical care. To claim that there is none and that doctors are greedy and don't do any work is trying to drive a wedge between doctors and nurses. We work weekends. In fact the current problem is that doctors are often breaching European Working Directives to WORK those weekends. And they aren't working for ""time and a half"". Hospitals tend to have doctors for critical care 24 hours a day 7 days a week. In most Casualties there are multiple consultants. Same for ICUs and other critical care. 

What we do need is more critical care. More A&amp;E doctors are a given considering how short of staff they are. More GPs too. More Ortho/Trauma to deal with the increased weekend loads. So a increase in both community  support and acute fields. 

Have we seen this? No. What we have seen is newbie doctors taking on more debts. 80 Grand Worth of Debt. GPs have been pushed to do things they didn't want because it's a waste of time in the form of the Health and Social Care Act and instead of funding and supporting emergency admissions A&amp;Es have been closed and the speciality chronically under recruited for years while the existing doctors were stretched thinner and thinner. Unless we flood the A&amp;E service with doctors from abroad who are already trained I don't think the A&amp;E crisis can be solved in my lifetime. After all. All those consultants are retiring and fuck if I am going to work in A&amp;E for the current pay and treatment... 

But we are demonising consultants. The apex of being a doctor. We are seeing a blame game where doctors take the blame. I read the Daily Express article. It was enlightening to be blamed for the crisis because doctors CAN get a 75,000 quid bonus. Never mind the fact that before that doctors would take in more guaranteed income and that in order to get that bonus you literally have to work above and beyond your 9 to 5. And they work weekends. So do I think that attacking doctors who work weekends is going to save that 6000 lives? The system needs to improve weekend GP care and better transfer of patients from care and staffing in acute medicine and vital services like Paramedics (who are really REALLY short thanks to cuts).  

To put this into perspective? I quote from a post that's making the rounds on facebook... 

""Let's put things in to context. An Assistant Manager in Pret-a-Manger has a salary of £29,500 and a Manager £40,800. In other roles their starting hourly rate is £7.70/hr everywhere except inside London where they pay £7.90/hr. On the current pay system a doctor has to work for a minimum of 9 years after graduating from their 5 year degree course before they have a basic salary higher than a Manager who works in Pret. How much student debt did people working in these roles accrue?""

""On Monday night I did something Jeremy Hunt has openly chastised. I worked another night shift as a locum in another hospital. Why did I do this? Because I, 34 years old, did not want to have to borrow money, yet again, from my elderly parents. It's embarrassing but you see I studied medicine as a second degree. I am Scottish but studied in England and therefore was liable for all my tuition fees and did not receive the NHS bursary, unlike my European colleagues. Sadly, during those four years, the student loans did not even cover my rent. I accumulated £20,000 professional studies loan and £7000 of credit card debt. Over £1000/month of my salary is used for debt repayment and I still have 26 more months to pay before I am only left with my student loan repayment. Living in London, my rent is £926/month. How much of my salary do you think I actually get to enjoy? Do you think I will ever be able to afford to buy a one bedroom flat in London? I don't think it's unreasonable to want to own the flat I live in, neither do you apparently but yet you seem hell bent on making it impossible for me.""

""Do I have to remind you that in order to get a place to study medicine I had to excel academically? I had to be better than all those other applicants who wanted to study medicine. I studied medicine at the University of Cambridge. In many other professions that would have been my ticket to earning mega bucks. As people frequently and correctly point out medicine is a vocation. I truly love my job and my career but I think you have lost sight of the bigger picture. It's all very good claiming you want a world class health service but if you continue to act irresponsibly and vilify doctors by suggesting we don't provide a 7 day a week service you will destroy the NHS.

My basic salary is less than £50,000 after working for almost 4 years since graduation. I studied for 4 years on an accelerated medicine degree while a newly qualified TFL Tube driver earns £49,673. Can you put your hand on your heart and tell me you think this is fair? ""Making work pay"" is your party's current slogan. Can you explain to me exactly how all my hard work is being rewarded? My reward isn't financial is it?. If you pay peanuts you get monkeys. If you want a world class health service you need to ensure that medicine remains an attractive career and a competitive degree course. The more you continue to vilify doctors and bully us financially the more unattractive you make it. It doesn't take a genius to realise that results in a lower calibre of applicant and a lower calibre of doctor in the long run. Being blunt, to make it through medical school requires an immense capacity for knowledge, problem solving, resilience and good old fashioned intelligence with an enviable work ethic. You and your party have behaved disrespectfully towards my profession and the NHS as a whole. It disgusts me.""

""You need to get real, not doctors. You can't even pay doctors and nurses and all the allied health professionals an adequate salary for their scheduled hours and you certainly don't pay us for all the extra hours that we do outside of what we are supposed to. You do realise that Trusts across England actively discourage us from reporting the actual hours we work because they can't afford for us to breach the European Working Time Directive or actually pay us for the extra hours.""

That's the anger a lot of doctors have towards Jeremy Hunt. Jeremy Hunt's drive at the moment is to demonise doctors so when the inevitable Work to Rule (the NHS runs on doctors working for free BTW) hits, the problem will be blamed on greedy doctors.

The only people who are at fault for the fact that this hasn't been a real debate, are those who haven't made an actual effort to argue for why their preferred candidate is better than Corbyn.

It's not Corbyn, the people who nominated him, or any of his campaign's fault that Liz, Yvette and Andy haven't risen to the challenge by providing a narrative that inspires the majority of members to vote for them. (And let's face it, none of them are going to win Labour the 2020 election, as everyone keeps saying, none of the candidates inspire the confidence and support from the public and Labour is doomed to collapse in its current state. That includes Corbyn - except at least with Corbyn Labour would try something radically different before collapsing.)

But no according to you and the PLP, the problem is that members are allowed to vote for any candidate they want. If that is what the Labour Party believe why not just go all the way: ban anyone who isn't an elected MP from voting for the next Labour leader and tell the members to just shut up, accept what they are given, pay their membership fee, and vote for Labour. I mean that's basically what you and those 47 MPs are basically pushing for...

I'm all for legitimate criticism on Corbyn's ability to run the party, but simply saying ""the members are wrong and we will overrule them"" won't cut it if they want to keep the funding and support of the 200,000 or so members who may vote for him.",null,0,null,1437394755,null,0,1437395234,0,ct9luzk,null,t3_3dv0wx,null,t1_ct9luzk,null,t1_ct9ljnt,null,null,null,1438021128,null,1,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

Personally, when I bought my flat 12 months ago, I'd never lived on my own before. The first six months of living here were actually a bit pish. There were certain benefits, it's true - like, for instance, nothing ever changed from how I left it, there were never any lights left on by mistake, I could sleep wherever I wanted without anyone thinking I was weird, it didn't matter what state the place was in because it was only going to be me in it anyway, and etc, but most of those advantages ended up just being to my detriment. I became lazy, my flat became messy, and all in all, things became pretty fucking boring. Having nobody around meant I had no impetus to keep things to a standard.

So, I decided to take on a lodger. I had a friend of a friend come round, we shared a beer and discussed terms, shook on it, and a month later he was in. Since then, things have been an order of magnitude better. I'm much happier, the flat feels much more lively, and I've actually got a reason to keep the place in decent condition and to continuously improve things. He's happy too, and certainly seems to be having a much better time of it here than he was in his last place.

Bringing it back to the OP's question about finances, putting it into comparison, the girl next door to us pays £780 per month for her rent plus property-related bills. My lodger pays a flat rate of £280, all included. On any income, I don't think it's hard to argue against that sort of saving, even if it is at the expense of living with someone who occasionally falls asleep in the exceedingly cosy little space under his desk.

~~Anyway, my question. What is your opinion on [this photo?](http://i.imgur.com/lcIWXfs.jpg)~~ 

On a more serious note, much has been made in the media recently of Jeremy Corbyn's bid for the Labour leadership and his left-wing politics and views. Many of my friends have expressed to me that him winning would make Labour unelectable. There have also been similar (yet nowhere near as drastic) concerns about Tim Farron. So, my question. Given the current opinions of the electorate, do you think Tim (and the wider party) will compromise on his/our liberal values to make the party more electable?

So I ordered a monitor from eBay at £90. Buyer paid postage. When I received the monitor is wasn't working i.e it was not as described so he asked that I send it back and that I also honour the eBay returns policy and pay postage, he would then issue me a refund. So I packaged it and send it, however when he received it he claimed he could not refund me because the monitor is more damaged than when he sent it. I requested compensation from Parcel Force Worldwide and they have denied it due to the fact that it's a monitor. So my question is would I be eligible and more to the point should I request a charge back from PayPal and would I win? I am happy enough to be banned from PayPal because I only used for eBay and I cannot see myself using eBay in the near future after this. 

Thanks!

Others have said they tend to try and fob people off - I can't help feeling that is because a lot of problems *aren't* serious and will in fact clear up in a couple of weeks. It is when they don't that they know to take further action. If anything, I feel chucking medication and treatments at people at the slightest hint of a problem would be the easy option for them. I have been twice for a throat infection and a rash, both times they did clear up without medication. I can see why people are upset if their problem doesn't however.

And I personally think it *was* reasonable for people to bring these questions up about the flag. Even when 99.9% of flag owners have never, and will never, commit a racist hate crime.

But perhaps you disagree.

Part of the confusion lies in the fact that it's not necessarily about the relative risks and benefits of photon and proton therapy. These are insignificant compared to the radiobiological risk of not completing a treatment course. The Southampton staff knew this and involved Police because of this not because they didn't want the child to receive different treatment elsewhere.

One of the effects of radiotherapy is repopulation of cancer cells. This ccurs when previously hypoxic tumour tissue receives a healthy blood supply following death of oxygenated tumour cells. This accelerates tumour growth and therefore requires repeated exposures to control. Any delays in treatment must be compensated before the end of treatment to stop this. If not, the extent of healthy tissue sparing can drop beyond the a point which makes treatment achievable.

Proton therapy is funded by the NHS in some paediatric cases, and the parents would have had the choice to seek proton therapy before treatment. The way they reacted could have dramatically endangered his life, maybe the new clinic were able to accommodate the change.

However  I have been shadowing GPs and one of the trainees, I quote, found 'working in hospital jobs significantly easier than working as a GP"". Its not an easy job,  they are the gatekeepers to the NHS and so it can be very difficult keeping on top of the workload. Yeah an 8-6 working week sounds decent but often they will be working past that time, trying to get paperwork and various other jobs done. The European working time directive rules in place only allow doctors to work 48 hours a week so it will be hard to stick to that unless they recruit a significantly larger number of GPs (which will be very hard to do).  I think as with everything once you reach the top then you become better at managing everything but until then you will be just as swamped with work just as any other doctor really. Also regarding pay, the ones earning the top amount are a small number  - partners and GPs in managerial roles. Standard salaried GPs earn less. Also, i should probably mention that they've had a pay freeze which hasn't really helped recruitment very much.

I'm wholly on board with your complaint about ""finger pointing"" but don't think you realise that the narrative you started is exactly that: you have started the blame game and your focus on cyclists vs. pedestrians distracts from the genuine problem (and form finding the solution) to people being killed or seriously injured by motorists.",null,0,null,1437395692,null,0,false,0,ct9m7dr,null,t3_3dlwia,null,t1_ct9m7dr,null,t1_ct9ia9k,null,null,null,1440471598,null,2,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,2,null

Outside of the league this season he did score 6 goals in 9 goals which is amazing but inside the actual league he only scored 7 in 33 with 4 of them from set pieces. I don't know how you can say he's improving when he went from scoring 22 goals and 15 assists in 13/14 to 13 goals and 13 assists in 14/15 (that's also with more games).

Benteke has actually always struggled with injuries and consistency problems, in 13/14 he didn't score a single goal from September 14th until January, ending the season with 10 goals in 26 games. Sure he was playing for a bad team in Villa but he wasn't playing to a high standard individually whatsoever.  

I screwed up my English with the Clyne quote but what's wrong with what I meant? Southampton only conceded 1 more goal than Chelsea this season.. and 15 less than we did. That defense made  Bertrand look like one of the best defenders in the Prem, he has never looked that good before.

Yes, Milner's quality as a CM earned him a move to City **5 seasons ago**, they rarely used him there even though they had issues with CMs the season just gone for a reason, he just isn't very good there. How exactly is he proven as a CM if the last time he received a chunk of game time there was in 09/10 for Aston Villa?  

There was similar optimism last summer also, hardly anyone was ragging on our signings... most people thought Moreno was going to be one of the best left backs in the Prem and that Markovic was going to be Sterling 2.0 ...

You can't easily ""make more"" doctors, training takes far too long and the talent pool isn't endless. You can try to persuade foreign doctors to immigrate, but that is likely ""politically impossible"" on any scale.

The governments ""solution"" to this? Make the remaining doctors work more. I'm still not 100% clear how much extra pay is involved or not, but honestly that is not a big issue compared to the working hours and the way the government are approaching it.

You highlighted that weekend care isn't as good as weekday; my understanding is that it is due to the lack of more senior doctors working weekends. As doctors get more senior, and older, they are more likely to want time for family. They are more likely to get worn out by excessive working hours. They can pick up employment in private healthcare or abroad easily, or for that matter they can ""retire"" from the NHS and go work for a pharma company or another field entirely. They are people in demand and can *not* be easily replaced, so pissing them off by trying to impose new working conditions and belittling them in public is *very* stupid idea.

It is definitely harder without more clinical information but it is indeed possible that the man was very unwell and pneumonia, for want of a better phrase, was the final straw. 

As an example Pneumonia can be the cause of death for stroke patients, HIV, drug overdose, COPD, IPF, heart failure, dementia, Alzheimer's , Parkinson's, motor neurone disease. 

The fact he died from pnumonia, as in the above conditions may demonstrate potential ill health in other areas that mean he should not have been working, a man so clearly fraile would not have survived going back into the community to work. 
I haven't explained this fully to avoid a medical lecture but this could very well highlight the dangers of getting non me fuck staff assessing people for fitness to work when they have no clue.

As a new member of the Lib Dems and Liberal Youth as of April, I am curious to to hear your thoughts on the direction Tim will take the party. I joined the party along with tens of thousands of others recently because It became apparent, among other issues, that Liberty and Freedom in all their forms were under attack from nearly all sides of the political battlefield. Surely this is evidence that the issues that are tackled and the principles of the party are strong and meaningful and that it was simply a case of failed communication that caused the poor performance in the GE?

I joined because I liked the direction the party was taking, I am apprehensive of a new leader claiming to take us in a new one. Are these fears completely unfounded and should I worry?

first things to consider are safety buffer in cash (around 3 to 4 salaries) somewhere on an account, easily accessible.
next are insurances. since you dont have a family yet that would be disability insurance for work.

then, get rid of all loans asap if possible. if you can pay them back prematurely, do so..


next, since you are young your primary focus should be investing in yourself if possible to increase salary. Degrees, certificates, studies etc... if this is all explored you can think about investing.. when investing you should then think about what is next in your life.. travel? house? car? etc... in case you plan on buying property within the next 7 years or so it would not be wise to allocate your money to open markets with risky attidude...if markets go bad, you could have less money than you have now when you need the money.. so if you want to buy something within 7 years you should only invest in low risk options, money markets (savings account), cash ISA etc. 


if you dont expect any financial expenditures soon (within 7 years or so) then here in the UK the stocks and shares ISA is an excellent vehicle to use.. just read up about what you want to do, active or passive investing, which markets or geographies, value or growth, small cap, large cap etc. there are alot of things to chose from and it depends on your own attitude (risk appetite), assesments of the markets and its conditions etc..

Everytime I go to Friday prayer, there are sermons and discussions to to reach out to vulnerable youngsters.

The things is that anyone who is being radicalized generally sticks with their own groups. They use the internet to communicate, since both the community is very quick to report and the police is very quick to shut down any dodgy madressas.

For those of us in small towns, it's in-hours GP, or a 20 mile drive to A&amp;E and then a 2-hour wait to be seen for something which - 20 years ago - took a locum half an hour to sort in your local practice.

In all seriousness, if you live where I do and don't have a car or are unable to drive, then acute treatment is basically unavailable short of calling an ambulance, which is *utterly stupid* if you've got something that literally just needs a couple of stitches.

There are 3 GP surgeries in my town, but if I need two stitches I need to travel 20 miles to the far side of the nearest city to get to an A&amp;E department. And if I'm alone/can't drive, my only options are to get on the bus (which won't be running at night, or the weekends - rural bus services for you), or call an ambulance and live with the £40 taxi fare to get home.

It's utterly ludicrous that not one of the 3 GP surgeries can offer some sort of walk-in out of hours service, and represents a really serious degradation in access to treatment considering that they were able to do this 20 years ago, but now apparently it's too difficult or expensive or something. I mean, I get that GPs are apparently very busy, but if the 3 surgeries pooled their 15 or so Doctors, that's one weekend every 3 months. To provide a local, walkable service rather than wondering how you're supposed to get 20 miles to a hospital via no fewer than 3 buses.

We do have a dental access centre, but for any non-dental matters that need immediate attention but are not life-threatening/999 severity, all provision is based on the assumption someone can drive you no less than 20 miles to an A&amp;E, which simply isn't a reasonable assumption.",null,0,null,1437396501,null,0,1437397937,0,ct9mid8,null,t3_3dqa4f,null,t1_ct9mid8,null,t1_ct9m6eq,null,null,null,1440471584,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

People say books, but it's basically the same thing (except you don't have to keep flicking back and forth for the answers).

It's not complicated; if you have some common sense, you realise that the laws and code make a lot of sense. It's designed to keep you safe, alert and informed on the road. If you do around 3 - 4 weeks of intense study (including the hazard perception test) then you should be okay.

You don't have to get driving lessons to sit your test - they don't ask if you have, although you do need to bring your own car - having an instructor helps with this. However, an instructor can tell you what the examiners look out for. They're notorious for failing you for simple things such as not looking at the mirror enough.

It seems like you're taking the driving tests quite lightly - and to be fair to ensure you pass the first time around, take it a bit seriously. Not saying it's the be-all and end-all, but if you understand that you can be failed for the smallest of infringements, then you'll understand that you need to tighten up and really learn it properly.

&gt; What should I look out for?

Read any contract you're given - thoroughly. If you're not given one, then ask why.

&gt; Does the job pay OK?

Purely depends on the hours you put into it. You do have to pay the company for use of their car - which can be around £200 per week (depends on car and location).

&gt; Do these companies really offer enough work?

Nope. They simply give you a student, and you have to arrange it with the student when they do the hours/work etc. Sometimes if you're lucky (during the summer for example) you get around 5 or 6 new students, and that translates to 5 or 6 extra hours per week.

&gt; How did you pay for the training?

Cash.

&gt; Anything else I should know?

That's not why I implied, that's what you *inferred*, I didn't say anything even close to that.

&gt; if a job is a stop gap then there should be no reason to need to pay a living wage in it, as people won't be living off it, they will be using it for some extra cash.

Extra cash on top of what? How are they supposed to eat, or pay for shelter? Where is this magical extra pot of money these people have that they're apparently topping up with extra jobs?

&gt; Encouraging people to stay in shitty jobs by overpaying them rather than encouraging to aspire to better things, more productive things, that add greater value to the economy and to wasting their own value is a good thing.

You use the word overpaying, the word you should be using is paying, as in paying enough not to starve or be homeless. I don't know if you've ever tried to live on the bare minimum, but it's pretty fucking motivating to get out of it.

Can will not get alot of chance to play in midfield.

Markovic will make his way into the regular starting XI as a part of the consistent, available rotating squad which is being created.

Sturridge will be fit for at least half the season and score 15-20 goals.

Coutinho will score 10+ PL goals

Benteke will score 10+ goals, Ings will score 5-10 (only because he won't start every game)

Firmino will impress, link up very well with Coutinho and Lallana, and our midfield will score 30+ goals. That includes Lallana, Henderson, Can, Milner, Firmino, and Coutinho

Lucas will score his second premiere league goal.

Mignolet well be runner up for the golden glove.

Liverpool's longest unbeaten run will be about 10 games.

Liverpool will finish 3rd in the league. United will win the league. Arsenal will get second. City will drop to 7th, Chelsea will drop to 5th, Spurs will finish 4th.

Jordon Ibe, Coutinho, Can, Henderson, Mignolet, and Ings will be our shining players.

scum get relegated, we win the league, Benteke scores 50 goals, Coutinho wins life, Lucas scores a PL hattrick

null,false,epicmindwarp,null,null,null,"ISA is not an ""investment"" per-se (assuming cash and not stocks and shares ISA). Think of it as a tax-efficient bank account. Everyone should have one.

Anything you earn on it is tax-free. This year you have £15,240 of **deposits** in which you are allowed to make into the account, and any interest you earn will be tax free. Although the interest rates are hideously low (around 0.5%), it's still better than an account that has no interest.

An ISA has no requisites, i.e. no minimum funding, no direct debits etc. So you can just go and open one with whomever offers the best rates. However, if you put money in, and you take it back out, and put the same amount back in, your allowance still goes down. It's not net deposits, it's total deposits.

E.g. 

- Allowance = 15k
- Pay in 1k
- Allowance = 14k
- Withdraw 1k
- Pay in 1k
- Allowance = 13k

Make sense? Don't treat it like a normal account.

There are other **current accounts** that offer higher rates of interest, but there are caveats i.e. 

- Santander 123, must have between 2 - 20k, max 3% interest, 2 direct debits
- TSB, max 2k ,5% interest, pay in £500 per month

And, if it's with an approved high-street bank, you'll get FSCS protection of up to £85,000 should the bank go insolvent (the chances of which happening are virtually impossible) - for both current accounts and ISAs.

If you're pro-risk, then you can invest in a Stocks &amp; Shares ISA - which shares the £15,240 limit. This means that your shares are wrapped in the ISA, and are free of Capital Gains Tax upon disposal, and any dividends received are tax-free aswell.

Facts are if you start paying so highly for menial jobs what is the point in spending £50K getting a degree, to work and commute 60 hours a week for a rather negligible difference in pay, far easier to just put your 40 hours in and go home not even having to think about the job again. If you work/commute for 60 hours a week, with £2K a year commute costs (which isn't much), someone on £15K a year doing 37.5 hours a week with no commute cost and a 15 minute commute ends up on the same money per hour as someone on £28972 after tax and for every extra thousand in commute costs they have to be making £1470 extra to make it back, for £3K a year commute costs that is over £30K a year. This is all assuming they didn't get a degree to get this professional job, at which point they are paying another 9% of their money above £21K meaning the amount to break even per hour is even higher and there are plenty of people who put in 60 hour weeks including their commute. 

There will still be shit jobs out there by definition that people don't want to do, but people shouldn't be sticking around in shit jobs because it pays too well to be bothered to leave, unless it is a high skilled shit job that has been priced that way due to market forces. 

Then again what this will most likely mean is large retailers just start 0 hour temping more 16-22 year olds never putting them on a decent contract so if they do stick around for 2-7 years they have either moved up the ladder to be worth that pay or they just cut their hours in favour of a cheaper labour monkey.

I think that if someone was angry every time they learned someone earned more than them then they would live life in an angry stupor.

But yes, perhaps people are angry at the amount MPs earn. Perhaps they do believe it is too high. Perhaps they want to see an MP pay cut.

Personally I am not particularly bothered, but it shows somewhat simplistic reasoning to imagine that it's pure jealously that is driving people upset by the amount MPs earn. 

I agree that transparency is the right way forward, but it's really no surprise to me that this is the reaction.

I have to say, I don't mind resources being spent for maximum impact, and I appreciate that cities have more people, and therefore higher demand than smaller towns, but yeah, there still needs some provision - even if that means the cities get dedicated Minor Injuries Units and Walk-In Centres, whilst rural towns have their GPs club together and work 1 weekend per quarter for minor injuries.

But obviously the NHS needs to contract that in and provide the resource for it. I know one of the local surgeries has had a new doctor in, and I don't think they had a long spell with a vacancy or struggled to attract someone, so recruitment doesn't seem to be an insurmountable problem.

We're surrounded by big cities, so it's not an overly remote place, I think more likely it's just slipped through the cracks. But if you're stuck with a minor but acute injury, driving 20 miles to A&amp;E is overkill, and if you don't have car access, then you might even be having to think about making a totally inappropriate 999 call.

&gt; •Budget and expenses: I am quite frugal with my money (a blessing and a burden). I live at home and don't pay rent, but I do contribute to bills and other things occasionally though it's not compulsory. Otherwise, socialising, commuting (to work and stuff), food, etc

Excellent. Keep every penny safe. You have no rent and that's a blessing. I still live with my parents (23), but I technically own the house, so they live with me ;)

&gt; •Short term debts: Except for my student loan, I don't think I have any really.

Don't worry about paying the student loan off. After 20 years, get's written off anyway. However, if you find yourself with substantial amount of money in the future (twice what you owe to SFC), then pay it off!

&gt; •Pension: Both my previous company and current company have matched 5%, so thats groovy

Excellent! I don't have any pension provision just yet (don't ask), but it's great you've started.

&gt; •Goal: I just don't want my money sitting gathering dust anymore. I want to do the best that I can do maximise what I have as the tiny interest I get in my savings account is silly

- You've dropped 20k into Santander - excellent. Use it to pay bills. My fibre broadband &amp; mobile phone contracts are paid from the interest payments AND I have money left over.
- Open a TSB Current Plus Account (but leave a few months between Santander account and this account opening). 5% interest on upto 2k. Use this as a back-up fund should times get really tough. Don't touch it, just let it build up.
- To get a property in London, you're looking at around 20% deposit. So around 60k you'll need for a decent one bedroom property to be even considered for a mortgage!

null,false,NoozeHound,null,null,null,"Our town has a static Traveller site, which over the years has made it something of a magnet for mobile travellers, e.g. the Irish gypsy community.

I really cannot think of any interaction or event that has ever been positive with regard to these people.

Next to their camp there was a Calor Gas storage facility. This has now been abandoned as it was turned over so many times.

Quite near is a petrol station that is regularly plagued by either the children trying to steal from the shop or young adult males intimidating customers. There has also been trouble over the years for people using the cash point. The police are frequently seen going to the site.

My then girlfriend and her daughter were at a small park. Some gypsy women were there with their children. The children pushed my then girlfriends daughter from the apparatus. When her Mother tried to approach the women with the children they berated her, swore at her and told her that her fortune was that her husband was going to die.

Opposite the petrol station is a park that has restricted access to prevent caravans getting in, There is a council run play scheme there. The gypsy children rarely attend but often taunt and abuse the children even with council staff present.

Pubs across town have to close if there is a gypsy funeral, as it is known any that open their doors will be mobbed and trashed as a result.

Ramparts have had to be put up on any common land as the travellers have previously moved onto the site, been evicted and left the immense detritus with the huge cost of cleaning these areas left to the council to pick up.

It's funny how the gypsy council never seem to turn up and pay for the clean-up operations needed to turn the invaded spaces back into a public space that is safe for human race, but have the money for top barristers.

A company I worked at had a large rear car park. One weekend a traveller group had moved onto the site. There were rumours that they had demanded twenty-five grand to clear out. The company would not pay it and went the legal route as fast as possible. As others have said the police did not get involved.

The mess they left when they were finally evicted cost nearly a hundred thousand pounds to clear up.

Prior to leaving the site one of the group took a shit on the bonnet of one of the workers cars parked in the adjoining car park.

Still more money had to be spent on entry/exit raising bars to secure the site from a repeated invasion.

I was on a job in Cambridgeshire. We were doing a managed printer migration. The job had to be put back on the morning of the expected delivery. A traveller camp had recently set up camp in vacant location near the offices of the printer company. Over the weekend all of the companies vans had had their catalytic converters stolen, immobilizing the fleet and preventing the delivery.

Another time I was working in Harlow. They had travellers turn up quite recently and the locals were telling me of all the trouble they had caused since arriving.

Finally, my dementia-suffering 83 year old Father-in-law was just going out of the door to go to the shops when he was approached by a man about the drive.

We lived with him at this time. When we came home from work he told us the (perfectly serviceable) drive was going to be relaid and handed me a leaflet.

I asked him if he had planned to have the drive relaid and he said he hadn't. I called the number on the leaflet and told them we were cancelling the work and the job was cancelled. An Irish accent argued that I could not do that.

About an hour a flame haired man with an Irish accent was standing on my doorstep telling me I didn't have right to cancel. Despite me telling him that my Father-in-law was ill, vulnerable and had dementia he refused to back down and went away rather angry.

As a precaution I called the non-emergency police number and passed on the story. The call taker told me he had seen the name of the company on a program on Channel 4 the previous evening, they were apparently renowned for this sort of thing.

Any media jobs are going to be VERY competitive, my best advice would be to start off in local or community radio stations on a voluntary basis. You'll gain some much needed experience whilst hopefully being able to spot some opportunities to progress onto paid work.

If you can get on the BBC scheme you mentioned, that would be a huge bonus. As I mentioned though, that might be difficult due to high demand.

I found out about [this course](http://mikeowenmedia.co.uk/2011/06/introduction-to-radio/) when I went to the job centre (we are going back nearly 10 years here...) and it was really great for laying a foundation of knowledge.  Not sure where you are located but this course was based at the Aston Villa ground in Birmingham.

PSG is still an excellent team, but that was a mental breakdown from the players. They got way too confident after the red and felt like they didn't have to try. But still, don't forget that we didn't lose a single CL game last season.

&gt; Falcao amazingly isnt even at the same standard as an ageing Drogba

Not true. Their production from last season is surprisingly similar, and Falcao has a pretty good chance of being better this season (due to form, coaching, play style, etc).

&gt; Begovic is unlikely to come off the bench and make the same saves as Cech

And we won't ask him to do that. Maybe in some early cup games, but we're not going to put him in for big games like we could with Cech. We have a world class keeper who will play most of the time.

Nintendo is not a direct-to-the-public-retailer, its a wholesaler, and save for its UK online store does not have its tax base in the UK, nor does it have an entity which does.

Reducing Corporation tax is the least helpful mechanism of supporting UK trading businesses as exists, as demonstrated by the government - when they want to provide subsidy to an industry they almost always do it through VAT - for example the print media receives £1.2 billion a year in zero rated VAT, similarly oil exploration to the tune of £400 million a year.

OP says he has £30k in savings.

&gt;then, get rid of all loans asap if possible. if you can pay them back prematurely, do so..

OP says the only loan he has is a Student Loan which isn't always best to pay back early.

&gt;next, since you are young your primary focus should be investing in yourself if possible to increase salary. Degrees, certificates, studies etc...

OP already has a degree and sufficient academic education to place themselves in one of the big four (tech) in London.

OP wants to move out in the next two years and is open to ownership.

null,false,Psyc5,null,null,null,"&gt; That's not why I implied, that's what you inferred, I didn't say anything even close to that.

No it is what you implied, as you implied that you should be able to live off every job that exists, therefore they need a living wage, you shouldn't, there are plenty of jobs out there that are and should be stop gap jobs that don't pay enough to live off, so people don't waste their own ability settling for marginality because it pays enough, if everyone was paid £100K a year to work at Tesco what is the point in becoming a doctor, or an engineer, in fact what even is the point in working full time? Just work 2 days a week for your £40K and sit around watching TV for the other 5, this just creates massive inefficiency in the economy. It is far better to make these menial workers to go on a training course and become plumbers, or office workers, or whatever relatively skilled trade that they are perfectly capable of doing given the inclination to do it, one of those inclinations being market forces paying these roles a living wage. Of course this means that training courses, paid training courses, should be available to make this possible and economically favourable for the person.  

&gt; Extra cash on top of what? How are they supposed to eat, or pay for shelter? Where is this magical extra pot of money these people have that they're apparently topping up with extra jobs?

Get a better job like everyone else did, plenty of people live off the minimum wage now, it isn't a great life style, but they aren't starving on the streets, having some discomfort because you get paid so little in your terrible job is inspiration to not have such a terrible job. I really isn't hard to get training to get a job that pays £7-9 an hour right now, if you actually have the inclination to do so, over paying people to do menial jobs just removes one of the incentives to do so.

&gt; You use the word overpaying, the word you should be using is paying, as in paying enough not to starve or be homeless. I don't know if you've ever tried to live on the bare minimum, but it's pretty fucking motivating to get out of it.

No it is over paying, a monkey could do these jobs, they shouldn't pay well so people aspire to their potential getting paid training to do something economically efficient. The irony being is as soon as you start over paying people for monkey work the sooner large companies invest in automated systems to replace and remove those jobs from the market as it will be economically viable to do so. Advanced automated systems cost a lot of money, if you make humans cost more, it makes the automated systems costs oh so marginally different, all while being more efficient than humans in the first place. 

&gt; You seem to be under the delusion that 7.85 or 9.15 is a shitload of money, and that anyone on that can just sit back and rake it in. No, it's the bare minimum need to survive without becoming a massive drain on society through benefits and other government assistance (which are now also being slashed so your double fucked).

Well proof that isn't true is people living off the minimum wage in the south of England, all with 30% cost of living increases over people in the north of England, so either the minimum wage is 30% more than you need to pay in the cheaper areas of the north, or everyone on the minimum wage in the south is starving of the streets, which they aren't, it is no great life style and I would suggest that £7.85 really is the minimum living wage for a decent standard of living in the south. But facts of it are the minimum wage is barely sustainable in the south, it is sustainable with a poor standard of living, but £6.50 is easily a living wage in the north already, as it is the equivalent of someone living off £5 a hour or less in the south, which people manage, not well, but they do it. So why are we artificially inflating the minimum wage in areas of the country where the currently minimum wage is already a living wage? Treating a country with vastly different costs of living, rent can literally go up by 100% between places in the north and the south, in the same manner is just ridiculous, if you want a living wage work it out by actual cost of living of an area, because that is exactly what happens when you get to a true market equilibrium, costs change depending on the cost of living, you won't get the same pay rate in Leeds as you do in Brighton.

Fuck med students who expect the government to pay out for medical training worth hundreds of thousands of pounds who then fuck off to another country to rake in the $$$ as soon as possible.

If you join the RAF as a pilot (with training costs running also into the hundreds of thousands) you are expected to complete a minimum term of service in order for the RAF to reap back the costs. It is not acceptable to have the RAF teach you to fly then fuck off and work for BA as soon as training is complete. 

I see no reason medical training in this country should be any different. The tax payer funds a doctor's training, so the taxpayer expects a return on this investment in the form of the doctor serving in the NHS. 

I feel that government-funded medical training in this country should come with a compulsory, say 5 years working in the NHS. If med students don't want to do this work, they should be required to pay back the cost of training, otherwise there is no return on the taxpayers' investment.

The way I see it, attending extraordinarily subsidised med school in the UK then fucking off to the US or wherever to reap the $$$ is simply scamming the NHS out of a free medical education, as well as taking the place of someone who actually wants to serve in the NHS.

Both offer similar physical attributes.

Now, Lennon is nearing the end of his prime physically (pace always being his top quality) while Townsend is just starting to enter his playing peak (I think he could continue to improve his crossing and eye for goal). Thus, Lennon is surplus with no more potential to unearth or refine with. He is a good player still in the league, but I think any time he gets would be time that Townsend could have to invest in his future development (not mentioning Lamela at all in this discussion since people mostly point to Townsend as the reason that Lennon is on the way out).",null,0,null,1437401848,null,0,false,0,ct9oyfh,null,t3_3dy3fr,null,t1_ct9oyfh,null,t1_ct9ouqs,null,null,null,1438023590,null,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5,null

null,false,sometimesihelp,null,null,null,"3% AER is the advertised rate but you are paid after tax so would only receive ~2.4% per year. The interest is paid monthly which after taking into account the fee would be about £37.46 p/m on £20,000.

The rules are being changed next year so that the first £1,000 of interest is tax free so, assuming the rates are kept the same, you would get ~£47.33 p/m on savings £20,000. 

This makes Cash ISA's somewhat less appealing going forwards as you would require £33,333+ (assuming 3% on multiple Santander 123 Current Accounts, some current accounts pay more but usually on much lower balances) in cash savings before being taxed on the interest anyway. The disadvantage of not using your ISA allowance is that you lose it but given your current income and savings you probably won't be maxing it for a few years anyway.

Edit: Also regarding nomenclature &amp; risk: ISA's are basically tax wrappers for money which means the money inside an ISA gets treated differently from a tax perspective (i.e. they are tax free). 

* A Cash ISA is similar to a wrapped Savings Account and is virtually risk free but with low returns.
* A S&amp;S ISA is a wrapped broker account for buying funds, ETF's &amp; shares. They are risky but with the potential for higher returns.

Because of this, they consider the Islamic *ummah* to be under attack and therefore it is permissible to wage a holy war.  It's a lot more complex than 'killing in the name of Islam'.  The justification isn't 'some scholars think that it's okay to kill non-Muslims', the justification is 'the Islamic nation is under attack for these reasons and therefore we're waging a defensive jihad'.

On my first Mod 2 attempt the guy who went with me and my instructor to the test centre was atrocious, really, really bad. No regard for the highway code or other riders on the way to the test centre.  Instructor was convinced he wouldn't pass, to our surprise he did while I failed.  When I asked him how he passed back at the school he simply said he rode the way the examiner wanted him to, the way he needed to pass.  As soon as he got back on his own bike he was off down the road riding like a maniac.  That makes me really angry.

I failed my first Mod 2 because another driver didn't have indicators on at a roundabout, so I waited to see what direction he/she was taking and the examiner said it was undue hesitation.

I don't know what the solution is but sometimes I think long assessment based testing would work better.  Prove you can ride safely, overcome any repeated mistakes over the course of a few weeks/months, show that you can learn etc.

For example, the cheese grater is that shape so that it does not effect the view of st Paul's from fleet street.
Another factor is that there are pretty much no big square footprints, due to the very old street layout which has not changed since London grew organically. This is one of the reason London has some of the most interesting architecture in the world.

Can I have a go on this crystal ball everyone against Corbyn seems to have access to?

&gt; That's why I'm voting for Kendall - but with Corbyn that's particularly easy to do.

It's what they will do for any candidate that doesn't follow the Tory line on everything, and any candidate that does isn't worth voting for. Liz Kendall is the latter.

&gt; The Tories saying he's their favourite candidate is negative coverage, by the way.

They of course have their own biases, at the moment they find the idea of him winning a general election inconceivable and the whole thing a bit of a laugh, that's just their arrogance. I'd love to see him win the leadership, provide a compelling alternative to the Tory narrative and go on to win the GE, and see Tory laughter turn to tears. I think that's at least as likely as a moderate/Tory lite candidate winning by largely going along with what the Tories are saying (and further disenfranchising anyone on the left in the process), and it would more worthwhile to actually have two opposing parties rather than two very similar ones that offer no real choice.",null,0,null,1437402434,null,0,false,0,ct9p9vs,null,t3_3dx5h5,null,t1_ct9p9vs,null,t1_ct9m4pn,null,null,null,1440471440,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

Men are routinely judged and examined on body image exactly as much as women in professional settings overall and in politics in particular.  

Every male politician is at one point or another attacked on this vector (lookup any male politician name with an attack ad search word like 'caricature') - I really have no idea where anyone would even get the idea that 'body image' is somehow excepted in politics for anyone. 

Even a cursory following of political process in any democratic country in this world would prove such assumption false within one election cycle.

Some of the reasons are as follows.
1. Its the least racist place I have ever known in the world - bar some media stoked right wing views, its almost non existent here (tho not gone entirely of course, such is life)
2. The amount of free shit to do in London is unreal...you could go out every weekend, spend the whole day and night out at different places, seeing interesting things and meeting interesting people and not pay entrance once.
3. The people...come from all walks of life and cultures and there is genuine integration, people in London are on the most part, non judgmental, friendly and accepting of others
4. Cool shit comes to London.

To give a small example....quite a few years ago now, I was working in Hammersmith, I went into the pub after work with some colleagues, and there in the pub, standing some 7' tall, in red traditional robes was a masi warrior (their official visit was even on London news a few days earlier as a fluff piece)

&gt;But this is also where Tottenham's decision to take euros became risky. The club will presumably receive a large payment on September 1st, the two year anniversary of Bale's transfer. Let's say Levy doesn't have any agreement in place with Real that mitigates the growing disparity between the euro and the pound; Tottenham could be out millions. Bale signed a 6-year contract with Madrid. Tottenham probably received a large lump sum with when it first sold Bale, but let's assume September's payment is exactly one sixth of Bale's fee: 15,666,666 euros, or about 13,250,000 pounds in 2013 currency. At today's exchange rate, those same euros are worth just 10,963,377 pounds, a loss of more than 2,250,000 pounds.

&gt;How might Tottenham have protected itself? Well, it depends on what the clubs negotiated. Sometimes clubs stipulate that after a certain amount of fluctuation, the buying club guarantees a certain value. In other words, Real might have to pay more.

There had been a few others before it, but after ""Blink"", I wondered if they had just figured it out, and was anxious to watch the next one. 

Next one was terrible. 

Here's what I wish someone would have told me early on. It sounds obvious, but most of it is the writer. Davies deserves the credit for bringing the show back, but Steven Moffat episodes really stand out. He was behind the series Sherlock - those were great, right? 

Starting with season 5, with the 11th doctor, Moffat takes over as the head writer. The show (to my eye) is completely different. It's more moody and story-driven than fun and whimsical. 

Anyway, so, get excited when you see Steven Moffat in the opening credits, and welcome!

That said, GPs seem to be hit and miss. My boss had a bad skin rash diagnosed as Norwegian Scabies. Turned out he had an allergy to tulips, but had never actually been in close enough contact with them before to get a response.

His GP had presumably looked at his file and seen no *known* allergies but to go from ""bad rash"" to ""Norwegian Scabies"" is the sort of jump usually made by hypochondriacs self-diagnosing on WebMD, sp that seemed pretty poor.

I also know someone who went in for a review of their contraceptive prescription and was seen by a locum who then marked a diagnosis of depression on their record. That caused all sorts of shit when they were trying to get security cleared for a job. I mean, you're a locum - you've never seen this patient before, and you're making psychiatric diagnoses because they seem a bit under the weather? Funnily enough, people tend to be a bit glum when they're ill (which she was - it was a scheduled consult for her prescription but she happened to be under the weather that week).

This is an easy claim to make but much more difficult to prove.

In reality, every atheist state led by atheists and practicing state atheism has descended into the worst brutality imaginable almost immediately. Virtually every other facet of those states has varied; geography, politics, econonomics, culture, with the only common factor being atheism. It's very difficult to look at that record and claim that the ideology of atheism was not responsible.

This is quite easy to demonstrate day to day; a quick look at r/atheism or any mainstream atheist forum like ""The Brights"" will reveal shocking intolerance and abuse directed at believers, uncontested and without any corresponding peaceful voices. If you want to see real us vs them thinking, you need look no further.

In fact if you like you can accept a challenge I've been running for over ten years without success: if the above groups are not representative of atheists, then where are the atheist forums which are not dominated by ridicule, abuse and hate directed at believers? They should be in the majority yet to date I have not found a single one.

They weren't all empty vessels waiting to be filled with the first idea that came long. It's because they were already primed to buy it: Debt and the deficit *were* high; welfare and immigration spending were pissing people off; people felt that public sector workers were inefficient and overpaid, and some areas of the public sector that had received a lot of money were still underperforming on some measures.

The accuracy or otherwise of these sentiments is irrelevant: The point is that people were willing to buy austerity because it fit perfectly into so many aspects of public feeling that had been developing from long before the crash: Welfare's too high? We'll cut it. Public sector workers are overpaid? We'll freeze their pay. And so on.

If your message is, as Corbyn's has been so far: 'No. We don't want austerity', then you lose, because you're not tapping into anything apart from anti-austerity feeling. This is borne out by the post-election polling and focus groups run by the TUC and others: People *knew* we'd protect spending on health and education, they *knew* we'd look after the low paid, they, in essence, didn't think we'd be 'austerity-lite'. They just didn't think we could actually run the economy, or deal with immigration or welfare spending.

If you start now, you could be £45k in debt by the time you finish, which is approximately 1/3 of the cost of actually training you.  Beyond that, the value of a new junior doctor is likely to be far in excess of what's left, when you consider people's diseases being treated or prevented from worsening , getting back to work, etc.  Currently you have to do one year to get your GMC registration, and two years to become eligible for specialist training.  So there is in effect a minimum term.  The real issue is surely why people are leaving in the first place, though.   

You may want to read up on how there is already 7-day provision of most service in the NHS, though.  

I would be very uneasy forcing people to stay here, it would be very authoritarian.  However, we've elected a deeply authoritarian government so I wouldn't be surprised if this was enacted eventually, when conditions are depressed to the extent that the medical brain drain becomes a significant issue.  At that point we will need to examine what we have allowed to happen in this country.  The medical profession will have been squeezed of all intrinsic value, as is everything else in this neoliberal era.  

Regarding your ""public service"" comment, I agree.  I am an NHS doctor and I'm very proud of my job and position.  I enjoy going to work every day, because I know that what I do creates real value for society, rather than profit for shareholders I will never meet.  However, people need to realise that doctors, as highly trained professionals with skills in demand all over the world, can just work somewhere where there are better working arrangements.  We are people too, after all, with families and our own lives to live outside of work.  If the government makes the role not worth doing in this country then it can be done elsewhere.

To incorporate or not should be a decision based on more than just saving tax, a tax system is broken when earnings are taxed as investment income. Gordon Brown started the nonsense of wholesale incorporation and it's had a much longer run than many of us expected, some form of NI like hike was inevitable.

I agree high taxing of businesses is not a good thing, this change does not do that, companies are better off, with lower corporation tax rates and an increased employers allowance (also available to unincorporated employers), there are also many other incentives to invest and employ, the tax legislation is replete with them and well of clients are still getting EU grants thrown at them. This change deals with the remuneration strategies of business owners as individuals, and as individuals they can damn well pay up like their employees do and those business owners do who did not incorporate.

I get that people will take this personally, but as a tax guy I see it as correcting a nonsense, if you want lower taxes for business owners then lobby for both incorporated and unincorporated please and then there can be a proper debate.

First, for work. While there do exist jobs in my particular specialism elsewhere, there aren't as many of them. Here, if I have a falling out with an employer I can walk into my choice of other jobs within a few days if I want. Elsewhere I'd have to look harder to find something, and would have less choice.

Second, because big cities are just plain better places to live. There are more things to do, more choices in pretty much every activity and product. And as one of the two major hubs in the national transport network it's a lot easier to get to other places when you want to. It's possible, of course, that my tastes and circumstances might change over time (although I've lived here for almost 20 years now so that's not very likely) and I might change my mind.

And I don't think it's over-priced. There are plenty of people here who earn a lot less than the average wage. There are even people here who don't earn anything at all - they're jobless, retired, disabled, whatever. Don't be fooled by the stupid stories about sky-rocketing rents that in actual fact only apply to a few small areas.

I'll have a further look into the 7-day provision, though as you're NHS staff I'm happy to take your word on it if you say a 7-day NHS is already happening in practice.

You're right though, there is a serious need to tackle the root cause of doctors leaving- the shitty management, crap hours, etc. 

I think this is an issue that needs to be tackled on both ends- the NHS needs extra funding to drastically improve doctors (and nurses/midwifes/support staff) working conditions. However, it should be made clear to prospective med students that a UK med schools are blisteringly expensive, and a term of service in the NHS is both expected and required as a condition of near-as-damn-it free medical education.

How would you give the party a more distinct identity beyond 'liberalism' which is unlikely to persuade a voter? How would you give the party economic credibility beyond stating that the lid dems are centrist?

stv is much better than fptp, but it is not completely proportional either. Are you happy with just stv or would you like to see a completely proportional voting system?

It's often said that the party is 'proud of our record in the coalition', but obviously people do not feel this way. Would you say it's worth trying to convince people of this or should the party move on from it? 

In some metropolitan areas, a large amount of immigration has brought in a number of issues. How would you solve these?

null,false,leedsimpson,null,null,null,"&gt;Most cyclists drive

80% of cyclists hold a driver's licence. There's nothing in that article to suggest those are substantive licences, and most people I know got a provisional at 17 to use as proof of ID, even if they didn't ever pass the test. It's also pretty poor to assume that because you have passed the test in a car, that is equally applicable to a pedal cycle. Why do we have motorcycle tests and multiple vehicle categories?
The only reliable figure that relates to what you have said is that 1 in 5 drivers cycle at least once a month - so, 20% of drivers may have an idea of what it is like to cycle.

What would you have the police do for cyclists? All we can do is encourage safe use of the road. We already investigate all personal injury accidents that are reported to us. We already ticket/summons for the majority of traffic offences (something we are ridiculed for by drivers and cyclists regularly - it's probably one of the most unpopular policing functions after stop and search).

&gt; Once again... I never said cyling collisions are solely caused by motorists.

No, you entered upon a rant which didn't really indicate stimulating discussion. Now you're mad because other people have different opinions to yours, in a discussion in the comments. Sorry if this didn't turn out to be the circle-jerk you were hoping for.

&gt;There are also laws on Furious Driving (1885)

As I recall there was a 2009 case where this charge was brought where a cyclist was racing down the pavement and caused the death of an elderly person. I can't find another one involving a cyclist. In any case, the issue is not a legislative one, I am aware the offences are there and in extreme circumstances they can be jailed. But where is the legislative capacity to ban someone from cycling? There isn't one, and so, if the offence isn't one deemed to be worthy of a custodial term, they can pay the fine and get right back on the cycle.

&gt;Jason Howard getting a £2300 fine for ""dangerous cycling""

He hit a 17 year old girl on a footpath and she later died. During the court case it came about that he apparently shouted ""move because I'm not stopping"" before crashing into her without slowing. He is a fine example of a man that should, at the very least, have received a ban on cycling for a significant period, but couldn't be given one as there was no legislative capacity to do so. If a motor vehicle driver was involved in a similar incident he would expect to receive a driving ban and most probably a custodial term.

So no, I don't think cyclists are regulated enough. I think licensing them and even having them hold insurance would go a long way to reducing cycle related RTCs. I also think that with that in place, you would be able to campaign for greater cycle awareness with the support of more motorists (like the success of the think campaign in relation to motorcyclists.

This entitled attitude as well - ""well, what are the POLICE doing about it?"" Well, I've explained what we do, but crime/danger prevention starts with the public. If defensive driving techniques were employed more by everybody, cyclists and motorists included, then the accident rate will continue to fall.

Full disclosure by the way: I hold a full driver's licence, don't own a car, don't drive at work and cycle to and from work every day. Some irony then that the regulation I'm suggesting would put me out of pocket, and I count myself a safe cyclist.

null,false,glashgkullthethird,irish,Ireland,null,"The problem with 'jihad' is that there are so many interpretations of what 'jihad' actually is.  Islamic scholars will tell you that there are two kinds of jihad - lesser and greater, the lesser being the outwards jihad and the greater being the internal jihad.  Jihad, after all, means 'struggle', whether it's without or within.  In the Islamic context, a jihad is a struggle in the name of Islam or a struggle to connect to God.  How a lesser jihad is justified is complex.  Some scholars, even Salafist and Wahhabist scholars, would tell you that the armed jihad as al-Qaeda, Boko Haram and Daesh is waging isn't really a jihad at all since their struggle is not a struggle in the name of Islamic teachings and practices since fundamentally what they're doing is not Islamic in the slightest.  The claim that this militant jihadism is 'by extension' related to Islamic practices and Islamic teachings, especially the concept of the lesser jihad, is faulty.

What the Quran does teach is that if the ummah is under threat from external aggressors then armed action is permissible.  If the aggressor seeks peace, then the Islamic nation must accept this kind of peace.  The examples I gave are only a few of the reasons why they believe their war is justified.  Another reason is a Salafist interpretation of the Shia sect.  The Salafists believe that being a Shia is to be a heretic and that their teachings pose a threat to the correct Sunni, and by extension Salafist, interpretation of Islam.  If you listen to interviews from Jabhat al-Nusra, whose ideology is similar to Daesh's, you will hear of a 'Safavid threat' from Iran.  The Safavids were a dynasty of Shia Iranian rulers who conquered a Sunni country and, over a few hundred years and a few dynasties later, created a Shia state.  When Sunni Islamist groups fight Iranian Shias, it is in the belief that they are defending the Sunni community from an external enemy, namely the not-really-Muslim Shias.  This is not the concept of 'jihad'.

With the Yazidis, well, I think we can just call it a day and say that what they're doing there is not Islamic since the religion calls for all religions to be tolerated.

In regards to the mass murderer point: if you think that Stalin's war against the Nazis was only a way to prop up his own regime and that he should have given up and have had the Russian and Slavic peoples enslaved, then you may be correct with the number.  Many of the deaths attributed to Stalin were casualties of the war against the Nazis.  It's debatable whether the Holodomor was caused by intentional Soviet policy or whether a variety of factors played into the number of deaths.  The others in the gulags were often kulaks, who had exploited other peasants; the bourgeoisie, who had exploited the workers; or aristocrats, who had exploited everyone.  There are much better criticisms of the Stalinist regime than pointing to the number killed.  With Mao, most of the deaths that happened in China occurred during the Great Leap Forward and they died due to a famine.  True, the famine was bad, but if you consider the trends of famines in China, then having a famine occur when it did is not surprising.  In other parts of China, the system seemed to work well.  China has been described as a 'land of famine'.  These deaths were not caused by Mao's totalitarian obsession (though some deaths attributed to him were caused by this) but rather out of natural occurences and an agricultural problem exacerbated by the fact that no one was willing to criticise his policies.  Much like the Stalinist regime, one should criticise Maoist China in other ways.  I could come back and tell you that 19 million people die every year due to famine, mostly in countries that are exploited by Western nations.  Without context, however, that's a really bad statistic to use, and it's exactly the same with the 'death toll' of Communism.",null,0,null,1437405135,null,0,false,0,ct9qu4l,null,t3_3dxgak,null,t1_ct9qu4l,null,t1_ct9pjja,null,null,null,1440471337,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

* ""Demand that internet service providers do more to remove extremist material and identify those responsible for it"" is an absolute bullshit measure that simply isn't going to work.

Otherwise, cracking down on attempts to radicalise communities, encouraging integration, investigating the causes of radicalism, and engaging with the Muslim community without demonising them are exactly the steps that we need to be doing.

PSG difference of opinion, I, like many pundits (not a great source as they are just as clueless as I am) thought Chelsea were nothing short of appalling.   

Drogba's dressing room presence and different style to Remy and Costa was more helpful than whatever Falcao could have offered last season. Next year is different but it looks like a downgrade currently.  

My point stands on Cech, he's a top four goalie, Begovic is a great goalie and an even better 2nd choice, but he's still not Cech. So is an unavoidable downgrade. 

How can you not know what im talking about. Every fan has a different view and different way they want their team to play. I know we must play defensively at times but forgetting the results, United, Arsenal, City and PSG all played better, controlled the game more and looked more likely to win.

Facts are you could easily live off £14K in Sheffield, you can live off the current minimum wage, as it is the equivalent £15.5K down south, that is just accounting for rent price differences, add in other costs an it is going to be more like £16K in the south, suddenly your apparent living wage is already in place in the north, or as is actually the case the south is just getting massively low balled and isn't on a living wage at all. 

So either your £16-17K figure is absolute BS, as in the south that is the equivalent of minimum wage in Sheffield, or you are proposing massively over inflating the minimum wage in Northern England, you can't have it both ways.

If you're really not comfortable with that, go back to your GP (insist on a same-day appt) and explain what has been going on, how things have gotten harder. They should then arrange either an urgent psychiatry appointment (1-2 weeks) or arrange for a same-day assessment if they feel its needed.

Atheism is not an ideology!.. it's the absence of those ideologies that are religion.
 
In the absence of religion, other motivations come to the fore. Greed and pursuit of resources cause problems, as much as idolatry; or personification of Good; or projection of personal responsibility. There are many evils in the world, religion is just one of them.

Atheists are a mixed bag and some are overzealous, perhaps feeling betrayed by having suffered religion. Those who frequent /r/atheism are likely the most extreme representation and rough edge; the majority of reasonable atheists, just want to get on with everything that is not religion.

To be clear, since you are likely confused, religion is that which is unique to religion, not that which is shared with normal human interest.. morality, sense of community etc are humanist and not religion. Religion is those evils that are idolatry; personification of Good; and projection of personal responsibility.

&gt; where are the atheist forums which are not dominated by ridicule, abuse and hate directed at believers?

Believers tend to be provocative and find their own trouble: they frequently cannot understand that people can get by well enough without the need for fairy tales. If you waltz into an atheist forum and clown around, among those who likely just want to get away from nonsense, they you will draw fire.

Being agnostic is perhaps easier to understand.. if two worlds are the same, with or without God, then any God is irrelevant. If you want respect, either believe in all the Gods or none.

Here is the statement he has released:

I wanted to update you on my position ahead of today’s vote on the welfare reform and work bill. 

The party has come to a position over the last week and we now have a Reasoned Amendment which sets out our opposition to the bill.

As you know, I was very clear last weekend that we could not simply abstain on this bill and that we needed to set out where we have agreement with reforms, but more importantly, where we strongly disagree.  For example, I have said that, as leader, I will oppose the two-child policy. 

I also strongly oppose the changes in this bill that will increase child poverty whilst at the same time abolishing the child poverty reduction target.  I will always defend our record as a Labour government of supporting low-paid people in work, and into work, through our tax credits. 

For these reasons, I have led calls for the party to change its position. 

Our reasoned amendment sets out clearly our opposition to many aspects of the bill. In truth, it could be stronger but it declines to give the bill a second reading and, therefore, voting for it tonight is the right thing to do. 

The Tories want to use this period to brand us in the way they did in 2010. We must not allow that to happen.  

Collective responsibility is important and it is what I would expect as leader of our party. It is why I will be voting for our reasoned amendment and, if it is defeated, abstaining on the bill. 

But I can reassure you that this is only the beginning of a major fight with the Tories. I am determined that we will fight this regressive bill line by line, word by word in committee.  If the government do not make the major changes during committee stage, then, as leader, **I will oppose this bill at third reading.**

It does not include or associate with any of the fallen from the nationalist/Irish side of the conflict, and you think that they do because it also remembers seven soldiers who died fighting the Nationalist side of the conflict? What? The English view it exclusively as a remembrance of the fallen dead of the World Wars and James McLean views it as something different, so the English people should not force their view of it on him.  


&gt; look at this from the english fan's point of view

The problem is you don't respect James McLean's point of view and what the symbol means to him is paramount on whether or not he should wear the Poppy. 



In a more extreme sense this logic would still hold true. In Hinduism a swastika was a sacred symbol long before Hilter adopted it, but if a Jewish person was asked to don the Swastika while experiencing Hindu culture it would be perfectly fine for him to politely refuse *because of what the symbol represents to him*. The Hindu's could look at him quizzically saying ""no no this is just a symbol of auspiciousness to us"" it wouldn't matter, the Jewish person would not wish to wear a Swasitka because of it's links to the Nazi party.

After that I was intrigued, then I saw the Peter Cushing movies on some cable channel, and I became instantly obsessed with the Daleks. My mum found some classic Dalek toys in a catalogue, and I played with them nonstop. 
At the time, I felt like the only eight year old in the world who knew what Doctor Who was, as my constant suggestion to ""play Doctor Who"" in the playground mainly just confused the other kids... My cries of ""Exterminate!"" fell on deaf ears.


Then, 2005, an advert is on TV. Christopher Eccleston is talking to the camera (I'm ten years old, and mistake him for Nicholas Cage...) I write it off as an advert for an action movie and go to leave the room. Then, I hear my dad say ""Oh, I've heard about this"". I stop, and turn to watch the rest of the advert, and...I SEE A DALEK! I'm so excited! A little while later, Rose airs, and I'm sat down eagerly watching.

When you start labelling one side (or both sides) terrorists it serves to completely de-legitimatise them, and allows people to de-humanise them as well. 


If you don't believe me look at how people on the other side of the conflict talk about the IRA, INLA, UVF, UDA etc, while their own side would (by and large) consider them at the least people who did their duty to stand up for what's right and the most, honourable heroes of the community.

null,false,Psyc5,null,null,null,"&gt;  The government should not be partially subsiding an inefficient firms profits by topping up via benefits the wages for a low productivity job.

Why does the government have to subsidies anything? They don't. 

Not to mention that the government taking money off rich people and giving it to poor people is one way of level the playing field in society, primarily that is always going to be subsiding poor people. 

The other problem with your argument is that is just wrong, plenty of college students do part time jobs for extra cash, they aren't living off them, plenty of stay at home parents do a job a couple of days a week for some extra cash, they aren't living off it, they are living off their partners wage. 

These jobs have no need to pay a living wage. The other rather entertaining thing about your premise is the solution isn't to pay people more, it is to automate the the jobs and completely remove the job from the pool, which is all well and good until there literally aren't enough jobs to go around, not everyone is smart enough to code the systems or work as techs for them. 

&gt; Think of the living wage as a way for the goverment to force companies to invest in productivity boosting measures, benefting the economy in the long run.

That is a perfectly reasonable perspective, until you take into account boosting productivity means removing the job from the pool completely, and these people inherently aren't trained to do anything else, or they would be and be getting paid more, and unskilled jobs will get less and less available as automation increases, especially if you are creating market inefficiencies by over paying them. 

Wait until driverless vehicles turn up, then they'll all br screwed and be wishing they could go back to the low minimum wage just to be hired in a job which is now taken by the more efficient automated vehicles. The economy isn't suddenly going to sprout 20% more essentially unskilled jobs when driving no longer becomes a necessary skill, but the less you pay them the less incentive there is to do that, especially if what you are paying them is way above the true market equilibrium point.

Pretentious much? We beat Liverpool and Spurs on our way to that title, so it means something. You are likely in the minority, and I will continue to call winning two trophies a double.

&gt; thought Chelsea were nothing short of appalling

Maybe I was misunderstood above. We were definitely appalling. However, I attribute that to an overconfidence, rather than a designed play style. Mourinho was obviously upset with what was going on in that game.

&gt; Drogba's dressing room presence and different style to Remy and Costa was more helpful than whatever Falcao could have offered last season. Next year is different but it looks like a downgrade currently.

We lose a locker room presence, and that's a big deal, but in my opinion Falcao will be a better player on the field for us than Drogba was. Difference of opinion here, I guess.

&gt; but he's still not Cech

Obviously he's not on Cech's level and is a downgrade. But it likely won't affect anything, as we still have a world class keeper who will play nearly every game.

&gt; but forgetting the results... looked more likely to win

Forgetting the results? Isn't that what we play for? I enjoy actually winning more than looking like we're going to win.

Stones has absolutely no guarantees of what his position within the team would be like after the year loan, especially with Zouma and Cahill looking to go nowhere.

It does appear as if you're being sincere, but this isn't the way to choose a club. A club chooses you. If your ""choice"" can be swayed by folks online then I don't think you can consider yourself a supporter. More an advocate.

I'll be more than happy to answer your questions, but not with the aim of converting you into a Palace supporter. 

If you want to choose between Palace, Millwall, Fulham and Chelsea then I'd sugget going to a game, or at least watching a game in a fan pub when you get to London.

Get a feel for the clubs and what they stand for. You'll soon discover who you support and you won't need folks trying to convince you.

You're not alone misunderstanding this but it is not difficult.

There's a famous analogy called [Russell's teapot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot).. which you're likely not familiar with.. but do consider it.

What you are asking above is equivalent to ""where are all the forums that do not believe in Russell's teapot?"".

The groups which are peaceful and tolerant of believers, do not identify as atheist, in the same way as they do not identify as not believing in Russell's teapot.. and all the other curiousities they don't believe.

Religion is a perverse indulgence of consistency to the point of absurdity and atheists and agnostics don't indulge it.. they don't need to identify with religion as being 'non-religious', which is the fallacy that religious people have in their perception of atheism. An obvious point to note is that religion never cared for logic.. it's too bound up with consistency.. us versus everything that's different.

It's not for atheists to be tolerant of believers.. it's for believers to avoid imposing their stupidity on others. Golden Rule applies.. even to religious nuts.. those who do not acknowledge the Golden Rule then can be considered extremist.. but that problem is not limited to religious peoples and can equally be found in foreign policy and the arrogance of politicians.

Almost as much is pensions. So let's means test them and remove the triple lock.

I'll answer some of your questions though:
&gt; My choices are: Crystal Palace, Millwall, Fulham and Chelsea.  

First off, don't be daft. If you don't *have* to support Millwall by birth or threat of torture then it doesn't need to be an option so you can sack that one off right away.

&gt; I want to join a community, yknow?

Not really, are you looking for a local or a football team?

&gt; Anyway, how are tickets prices?

High and climbing, lower than Chelsea.

&gt; Atmosphere of the stadium? 

Best in the league.

&gt; Fan acceptance of transplants such as myself?

Unless you're being a knob people won't care. You always get one or two bellends who need everyone to know they are the more loyal/bigger/best fans though, but they won't see the difference between you and a lifelong supporter that just can't make every single game anyway.

&gt; How hard is it to get to Selhurst on a matchday from, say, Vauxhall or Clapham?

Either would be fine, I come from the other direction into norwood j so someone else can probably be more help but would guess you're best off getting train to thornton heath (then walking to the ground). Will take less than an hour depending on trains.

&gt; What's the general reputation of Palace fans

No idea, not sure I care, we aren't particularly maligned (unless you ask our main rivals of course) for any reason and are generally known as having the loudest, most impassioned support in the league, so positive overall I expect.

&gt; Since Pardew has come aboard, am I too late to join the bandwagon, so to speak?

Fazio I think still offers something to the back line, Cb is also notoriously harder to adapt to. 

It seems mental to view 2 signings as a suggestion 'they' can't pick good players, especially when we have signed Paul Mitchell since then.

The amount of easy wins that we're missing is ridiculous.

Just off the top of my head:

 - A two child policy, if followed, would mean we will always require immigration as it's below the replenishment rate. Especially when you consider that poor families tend to have more kids, so those that aren't impacted are likely to have 2 or less kids anyway.

 - Thanks for buying into Miliband Economics George! I'm sooo glad you've changed your mind from three months ago!

 - Missed another deficit reduction target George? What happened since before the election? How many is that you've missed now? Why should we believe this one?

 - Where's the growth George? GDP per capita is flatlining, suggesting that any growth is from immigration and population growth. Is that the ""long term economic plan"" you keep talking about?

I'm sure given a degree in politics and a bit of time I could think of more/refine them further. 

The public doesn't agree with all the benefit cuts. They only want to hit the unemployed and the wealthy pensioners, they don't want to see the sick, elderly or families hit. This government is failing on all the metrics it's provided for itself. They've missed more deficit targets than I can count, they're on track to miss their export target. Productivity is stagnant and a nice easy to understand illustration of this is hand car washes, a crystal clear example of what happens in a low wage economy.

What do we get? Nothing.

By institutional, primarily I meant in law. As I say, obviously there are still sexists out there but there is nothing within our institutions that disadvantages women - quite the opposite actually.

Are they really that underrepresented now? Most EU nations have had a female head of government at some point over the last 30 years, and many countries do currently.

The UK doesn't currently have a female head of government, but then our most loved (or loathed) ex-prime minister is of course female. The current secretary of state is female. If May beats out Johnson/Osborne to the role, the next prime minister will be female. Labour have a woman at the helm currently and may elect a woman as their next leader also. As it is 29% of MPs are female now too, cross-parliament. The Scottish leader is a female.

&gt;i ignored your question because it's fucking stupid - of course being an attractive woman has it's benefits. what advantages are you referring to though, men in positions of authority will find you attractive..? that's a bit of a conflicted ""benefit""

Glad to see you acknowledge it finally!

But you don't give women nearly enough credit. Women are naturally much better manipulators than men anyway, and attractive women particularly can make men do all sorts for them, right from getting jobs despite more qualified candidates being available, getting their car fixed, DIY done - basically any traditionally male job/role - through to small things such as never needing to spend a penny on drinks in a club. Men will fall over themselves to help an attractive women at any given any opportunity.

These are the advantages that the article author misses, though of course she could never admit it as it somewhat tarnishes the feminist narrative.

As I mentioned before, women have institutional advantages too. Family law is heavily skewed towards women. Sentencing for crimes heavily favors women. It's not all sunshine and rainbows for women generally nor attractive women specifically - I accept that - but to ignore the benefits women have in society completely is what fuels men's rights groups, and the growing backlash against modern feminism.",null,0,null,1437408976,null,0,false,0,ct9t9nh,null,t3_3dxvpd,null,t1_ct9t9nh,null,t1_ct9qnqb,null,null,null,1438026865,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Can we stop posting articles that are nothing but conjecture and future predictions and perhaps start putting forward an alternative vision?

These constant attacks on Corbyn are at best ineffectual and at worst counter-productive. Rather than whinge the membership aren't voting your way, perhaps try and work out why.

The argument that we need to be more centre ground is not won, it's conjecture and conjecture that flies in the face of opinion polling. There's a reason we lost 5 million voters under Blair and it wasn't being too left wing. There's a reason that two thirds of voters feel there's no difference between the two main parties so what's the point, and it's not because we need to be closer to the Tories.

I'm not saying the opposite viewpoint is right and this is wrong, I'm saying it's all conjecture and unprovable. I could point to stats showing our support growing before Blair and dropping throughout his term until it rebounded when he left. It's not cut and dried.

What *all* leaders need to do is provide a vision for the future and a vision with hope. The reason Corbyn is doing well isn't because we're all hard left nutters, it's because he's not as bland and pointless as the others. Where's the optimism in Kendall's vision (what is Kendall's vision?)? Cooper comes the closest with vague statements about a high tech economy, but that's about it.

I turned 15 last week and have considered joining the Liberal Democrats ever since the General Election. I'm outraged by illiberal and unfair Tory proposals like scrapping the HRA, needlessly making £12bn cuts to welfare and reintroducing the Snooper's Charter.

My first question is similar to JackWilfred's first question: what opportunities would joining the Lib Dems give me, as a young person? I don't mean career-wise (Tim Farron's made it quite clear in his campaign that no Lib Dem does or should join the party for a career), but moreover, how would I be able to help the party?

Secondly, I'd also like to ask whether there are many young people in the party, and how young do they tend to be?

Finally, whilst we've heard some of the issues that Tim will prioritise in the next few years, which issues would you advise him to take up in the next five years as the ""Hong Kong Passports"" of this parliament, which will really allow the Lib Dems to re-engage with the electorate?
