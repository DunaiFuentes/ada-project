There's communicating, and communicating effectively to a wide and public audience.  Failing to be able to communicate effectively is unprofessional, especially for someone looking to hold some form of political power.  It wouldn't be accepted when applying for a job, why should it be accepted when seeking election?

Especially when being able to communicate effectively is essential to making claims and arguments and putting across points on very complex topics surrounding running the country.

Some have said that illiteracy doesn't not mean lack of intelligence.  I'd agree in some regards, however it does point to lack of basic education and further, a lack of a higher education. Now higher education obviously isn't a requirement to run for election (though it would be nice I think to have educated individuals that have studied and worked in the areas of Government that they are being elected to) but a basic education, that is understood and practised definitely should be.

How can we expect politicians to boost the standard of education for example, if they can't demonstrate the skills themselves? I'm not even necessarily annoyed at the basic grammatical errors, but it's the blatant spelling mistakes that would have easily been solved with a little extra effort such as proof reading that are the most annoying. And the fact people will take this and repeat it verbatim without checking the errors themselves.  It doesn't promote good practise and therefore doesn't promote a good man to do a job. It does the opposite. That's the problem, and that's the joke of it.

Asking capitalism to take care of your planet is like asking Jimmy Saville to look after your kids.

Capitalism is primarily focused on growth. It's actually quite good at growing. And it's good at working around restrictions on growth (which is what we need). Despite having talked for decades about ""restricting greenhouse gas emissions"" and ""social markets"" etc, under capitalism greenhouse gas emissions are still going up every year, as is inequality, as is deforestation. 

In order to prevent global warming, oil resources need to be left in the ground. There is simply no mechanism to do that under capitalism. They are too profitable (witness how our politicians talk about being green, but then rub their hands as new oil is discovered, and pass laws to make it's extraction easier).

I've taken to wearing Biore Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50 PA++++ every day that the UV index gets above a 2.

I also have Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch SPF 45 which I tend to carry around in my bag to top up if I find myself outside for longer than 2 hours, or if I'm going for a run as it's sweatproof. I'm looking for a different sunscreen for this purpose though as the Neutrogena doesn't have any markings to indicate the level of UVA protection, and I find it too greasy. I've ordered a couple of waterproof ones with PA++++ after the amazing suggestions I got in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/32oow2/help_sweatproof_sunscreen_for_running_outdoors/) in /r/asianbeauty.

I picked up a pair of sunglasses with good UV protection, which I'm wearing pretty much any time I'm outdoors from now until winter. I'm looking into big hats as well, though I'm a little reluctant as I can't find any that suit me aesthetically.

As someone with Fitzpatrick type 1 skin I'm used to sun avoidance because I can pick up a light sun burn from as little as 20 minutes walking through the park on a bright day. I rarely go out between 12 and 2pm, and even outside of those hours I'll seek the shade and cover up as much skin as possible.

It's only in the last couple of years that I've really gotten into skincare and now that I'm avoiding the sun for anti-ageing purposes as well as sunburn, I was so happy to discover that sunscreen doesn't have to be greasy, thick, smelly, white goop!

He's looked a little off the pace as you can imagine and lacking slightly in mobility - his left knee was heavily strapped for both matches. He had a few chances against Fulham and Leicester that if he had've been abit quicker off the mark he would've gotten to before the keeper, but like with all great strikers the ball seems to just fall to him in the box so hopefully with a bit more match fitness he'll start to finish off some of those opportunities. I think the U21s have 7 matches remaining, including one today against Spurs at WHL, so obviously the main aim will be for him to get his sharpness and confidence back ahead of pre-season (hopefully with the first team!!) so that he can show what he's all about next season - I think that will be the final year of his contract so he's going to have to put in an unbelievable year to stay here beyond that.

As for Sergi, he has 18 goals this season which makes him the 2nd top goalscorer in the academy behind Sinclair on 22. All but one of those goals have come with the U18s though, and when he's made that step up to the U21s he's struggled to impose himself on the game. The system they are using doesn't really help him either - in the last game against Leicester they mirrored the first team by playing with 3 at the back and Canos and Wilson as wing-backs but that really doesn't suit either of them at all.

Lowering the fees only changes how soon wealthy graduates get to stop paying graduate tax, which is actually a regressive policy, yet Labour are pushing for tax cuts to well-off 40 year old graduates.

Jokes aside: neoliberalism or ""laissez-faire"" liberalism is the complete removal of governmental responsibility from every day life (""small state"") which advocates among other things privatisation of services and large spending cuts (austerity). Both of these things are known to increase inequality and an upward redistribution of wealth due to the tendency of such governments to prefer keeping large amounts of business with the same corporations.

Capitalism is not the problem, the application of it is.

Capitalism's opposite - Communism - has been repeatedly shown to leave power vacuums and/or concentrate too much power in the hands of too few people. What alternative do you have then? Anarcho-liberalism? Which has the same problems since human beings naturally tend to seek dominance over others and you end up back in one of the previous systems eventually.

Is that actually likely? 

a), how busy are they at the moment?
b), do you ever see them out of action?

It's just a plug socket, which makes me think it'd require a total power cut before they went out of action, and power cuts at a workplace tend to be pretty catastrophic in the 21st century (ie, you'd have no work to do). So it's not exactly a common situation IMO.

The advertised range is 130 miles, so the general consensus in this thread is:  
IF the real-world range is less (say, 80),  
and IF it's a very cold day (say, reduces that to 60),  
and IF the 1st and 2nd charging ports at work are unavailable all day when it happens to be very very cold,  
and IF on that day you can't talk to anyone at work (""could you move your car please?"" etc,  

then you might have a problem. But that's an awful lot of coincidences for a single day, and you could always plug it in somewhere else near work in such an exceptionally catastrophic situation.

He was trying to set the narrative in the press a couple months ago, saying all the right things, loving his time at City, wanting to stay, needing playing time etc. Then you had someone from his camp briefing the press that it wasn't anything to do with money it was the length of the contract etc.

It's so fucking transparent.

He's played us for fools, we're going to lose a £15m-£20m asset for absolutely nothing due to his calculated self-interest and lack of loyalty.

He could've signed a contract two years ago, a year ago, and left with our well wishes this summer.

Make no mistake, this has been a very calculated move on his part. He has previous for it as well.

Depends on your definition of failing. It is clear that reducing government spending would have an immediate negative effect on GDP. This is because it takes time for mis-allocated resources to become used more efficiently. The medicine takes time to work.

It's like a drug addiction. When an addict stops taking drugs they go through withdrawal. It's only later the benefits are felt. If the addict takes more drugs the 'good' effects are felt straight away.

It is the same with all busts. Resources are allocated badly, generally due to a credit bubble. When the credit is withdrawn there is a recession as the economy corrects.

All I'm saying is that it's impossible to immediately create an idealistic system in which the people and the planet are healthy and happy, although it is a noble goal for the distant future.

First, we need to focus on how we can reform the capitalist economy in a way that best serves our interests. That should involve heavy government intervention in order to restrict the type of cowboy capitalism which has been in place since the 1970s and led to increased inequality and greenhouse emissions.

All are Conservative policies that have helped the economy.

Blackett definitely is not at Rojo and Smalling's level.

However, at the Leicester game, the whole team was in the early stages of learning how to play under LVG. If you look at how we played against WBA and Leicester specifically, you'll notice that our players seemed lost on the field. Kind of like bus boys that just got hired and are not too sure what they're really doing. And second, what happened to United at Leicester earlier in the season is an anomaly, which was fueled by dubious referee decisions. 

Obviously, there's no arguing that Blackett will be the weak link and Mourinho will try to exploit it somehow. I won't be surprised if he fucks up and you end up scoring due to him. But to say that Leicester wrecked him is very misinformed.

All that discussion is disregarding the fact that McNair is most likely going to start instead of Blackett, and McNair has been nothing but quality when he has played.

#Explanations, caveats and answers to common questions. 
**The level of unemployment is not calculated from the number of people on out-of-work benefits** so sanctions or the actions of job centres will not affect it. These figures are based on a survey called the Labour Force Survey which samples around 40-45 thousand people every quarter. There are unemployed who are not entitled to out-of-work benefits  (e.g. those with a large household income due to a spouse, those with large savings, or those on sanctions) and there are people who claim JSA but are not unemployed (e.g. those who work less than a certain number of hours or fraudsters), so the two are not the same. The number of people claiming out-of-work benefits is reported separately as the Claimant Count. 

Zero-hour contracts are not regularly measured, however there is some regular measure of “underemployment”  by measuring those who are in part-time work but wish to be in full-time work. People self-select whether they are full time or part time. Equally those on temporary contracts who wish to be permanent are counted.

The rate of unemployment is an economic measure of spare labour in the workforce not a political measure of how well a government is doing at making sure everyone is happy with their job situation. As such, those on workfare, government training programmes or unpaid internships are not counted as unemployed; they do not currently have spare labour to add to the economy. However those on “Government supported training &amp; employment programmes” are reported separately so you may recast the figures should you wish. 

The definition of unemployment requires someone to be actively seeking work in the last four weeks and able to start work in the next two weeks. Those who are out of work and say they want a job but don’t meet this definition are reported separately under Inactive. Note that the Inactive category is only for 16-64 year olds.

The figures are calculated by the independent Office of National Statistics based on internationally agreed conventions. The government cannot interfere with the calculation of the figures or set the way in which they are calculated. However knowing how the numbers are calculated does mean governments can set policy accordingly and create targets which may not be in the best interest of the public. 

The numbers are seasonally adjusted, so there should be no effect from things such as Christmas jobs.

Given that the numbers are based on a survey, the figures can never be perfectly accurate and there is a margin of error, e.g. the 95% confidence interval for the unemployment rates is ± 0.2%. The numbers should be seen as approximate and are best understood in terms of the trends they show over time.",null,0,null,1429286005,null,0,false,0,cqfki62,null,t3_32wmaf,null,t1_cqfki62,null,t3_32wmaf,null,null,null,1432446341,null,33,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,33,null

&gt; **Only about a third of the 1,000 employers questioned had a contractual provision or formal policy outlining their approach to arranging and cancelling work for zero-hours workers.**

So only a third of employers have any policy in place regarding cancellation, and 40% had shifts cancelled at the last minute.

This is a horrible way to run a company. It leaves shitty managers a huge amount of leeway to penalise staff when they don't want to do overtime, and by the sounds of it it is affecting a lot of people.

According to other recent news articles, almost 700,000 people in UK have zero-hours contract as their main job. So that's potentially 280,000 people who have had shifts cancelled with no warning.

Why shouldn't we improve this simply because the rest are happy with the current situation? How can anyone argue that because the majority like the contracts, that the rest of the people should just put up with it?

Polling shows about a third of people in the UK wish to renew the 4 nuclear submarines while another third wish to not renew the system but replace it with a scaled down, cheaper one. About a fifth of the UK wish to completely scrap nuclear weapons. So clearly more people are for taking steps away from the 4 subs than in favour of keeping them.

There is obviously huge differences between political parties, but that's for the UK overall.

Source: https://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/07/15/trident-keep-scrap-or-downgrade/

(It also goes on to show that more people are for renewing the 4 subs compared to completely scrapping them, but this is rather pointless as it doesn't take into account there is more than 2 options.)

We should seriously look in to another system. A cheaper, scaled down one. We do not need these submarines at their huge current expense. Let us look into further option for scaling down our nuclear deterrent as much as logically possible before we decide whether to go for an all or nothing option.

If he were to start talking up an SNP coalition now, it would free up too many Scottish voters wavering in support to go ahead and vote SNP. The few Scottish Labour MPs who are returned to Westminster would feel betrayed and abandoned by Ed, which really wouldn't be good for the party.

I do think Nicola had a tough role to play at the debates last night, both emphasising to Scottish voters that they are her primary interest, but also trying to moderate the independence stance for English voters wavering in their support from Labour that she would love to work with Ed to change politics for the better for the whole country. I thought she did a decent job of that, and she had to - she knows that her only shot in power is being hitched to Labour. And likewise, Ed knows that barring some divine intervention, Labour won't be able to form a majority on their own. So they both have to play this stupid coy game of pretending to be at arms' length to shore up their own supporters geographically.

As a Labour supporter, I'd personally be more than happy (in fact, I'd prefer) a coalition with the SNP. Hell, I wouldn't even mind letting the PC or Green MPs (if any) inside the tent as well, even though they probably wouldn't be needed to form a majority.

That said, while I do agree that porn may have an impact on attitudes toward sex, I feel that scapegoating it as she hints towards doing in the video is a dangerous trend which is becoming increasingly apparent these days.

Yes porn may present an unrealistic view of sex, but is it actually to blame for the real life behaviour she alludes to, such as the choking without consent?

If this behaviour is as widespread as alleged, does that not stem from a deeper moral and behavioural problem with the individuals themselves?

Ultimately if we applied the same rational to violence in the street and placed the blame on videogames, the overwhelming consensus would be along the lines that kids should be able to disconnect the game from reality and should know better.

The analogy isn't perfect of course and aligns with what she said about sex education being lacking, and it is; but ultimately I think that there is a lot more at play here than just porn.

5 years later he finally gets it seen to, and he's got a very seriously strong case of gout that requires regular steroid injections and a constant supply of pain medications.

The doctor even told him that had he caught it early enough it may have been preventable with a change in diet. He's 42. He's likely to live to see 65 at least, but he'll be popping pills for the rest of his life, and visiting hospitals more times a year than anyone ever should.

I agree that bluntly shouting racist at someone because they say they'll vote UKIP is an ignorant thing to do. But, [UKIP's support is strongest in places where there is minimal immigration.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/11539388/Mapped-where-is-Ukips-support-strongest-Where-there-are-no-immigrants.html) Its not even strong in places next to those with immigration. UKIP are supported mostly in regions nowhere close to large-scale immigration.

I would also like to see a UKIP voter explain why they aren't bothered by the many scandals UKIP have had. E.g. gay marriage causing floods, Farage saying he'd prefer to privatise the NHS or scrap laws on colour discrimination. A rare scandal caused by a politician, fair enough, its one individual. But UKIP's aren't. Its frequent. And it senior people - elected councillors, MEPs or their leader himself.

&gt; People who vote UKIP have a legitimate reason to vote UKIP, because a lot of what the party stands for represents their views.

On the EU as one example, why are they so desperate to quit beyond immigration? UKIP say its because our laws are made in Brussels (over 75% apparently).

But that's not what you said. You said the UK was growing more slowly than other developed economies. Now that I proved you wrong with your own data you are conceding that we are growing but it's only because we fell so far. But if that is indeed the case that is not the coalitions fault as it happened before they came to power. So what exactly are you arguing?

Also the fact that ""we're still so far from where we were, unlike France and Germany"" is also untrue. You only gave numbers up to 2013. According to more up to date numbers from the IMF we now have a greater GDP per capita than France and will overtake Germany in the next few months given current trends. 

&gt;And the G7 is not the ""developed world"", it is a very small subset of the developed world. Being second of 7 is nice, but when you consider that 3 of them are hamstrung by being in a completely unworkable currency union and one of them is going through a fairly remarkable demographic transition which no other country has gone through before, it's far from impressive. Stick Australia, New Zealand or Korea in there for comparison.

You appear to have only looked at one of the links. According to the other one I provided we were the fastest growing in the OECD as well, that is the top 34 countries including Aus, NZ and SK.

[£3.5K @ 4% in Lloyds, £2k @ 5% in TSB, £3K @3% in Santander] = £330 gross annual interest. 

So there *could* be a case for opening a 1-2-3 account (and then continuing to save any additional cash back into Lloyds as first priority, then Santander if you get Lloyds back to the maximum). 

That said, Santander's £2/month fee would risk eating almost all of the gain unless you pay enough in electric/water/phone/internet/council tax bills for the cashback to make up the difference. And it could be a lot of faff for not much benefit if you later need to take it back out.

Alternate plan would be to find an easy-access cash ISA to put it in - less hassle, and less risk of accidentally negating the potential benefit, but probably only ~1.5% interest.

Got this far before I thought to go check a list of high-interest current accounts - there's also Nationwide, offering 5% for the first year on balances up to £2500, although that requires £1000/month deposited (not sure of the rules as to whether you could just pay money back and forward between accounts until it totals £1000 in deposits... but I suspect you probably can just set up a circle of standing orders)",null,0,null,1429288483,null,0,false,0,cqfm2q4,null,t3_32xmi3,null,t1_cqfm2q4,null,t3_32xmi3,null,null,null,1432447153,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

Met Torres and his family two times.. in a span of 1 year.. and he remembered me the second time.. talked for a good 5-10 minutes, was really great! Funniest thing was after our conversation he realized his family (was with him when we started the convo) left.. and he was like oh dear .. I gotta go and he sprinted haha. Luiz.. well I was in the elevator.. and then I just see a huge afro man enter I was like yeah oh well.. and then after probably 10-15 seconds I realized it's Luiz LOL... Willian I was with him.. started singing the Willian song he was laughing.. not a lot of people knew who he was then and when they realized they all rushed to him...and Willian was signing my shirt.. and then when everyone came.. he entered the elevator.. my shirt was dropped and unsigned.... he stopped everyone.. picked up the shirt.. signed... the elevator closing and he throws it back and winks at me, haha that was GOLD!
Mata.. well I thanked him for everything he did at Chelsea.. here is the video if anyone is interested:

What about fliers/announcements and the reading age they write them for? The language we use to ensure society understands directives? 

Now, look at the spelling/grammar/sentence construction used here from both a psycholinguistic and sociological viewpoint. First we have the language ability of the writer, then we have writing for purpose. Innate/learned abilities, and then deliberate, targeted language usage. Perhaps, just perhaps, the writer represents a section of society because he/she is one of them. Or they're being clever and deliberately targeting that section of society? Although Farange is stating the media is blurring their message, I think, and we've seen plenty of evidence of this, those who work within his party, or for them, are believing the blurred media messages.

Most of the development was private in the UK if you look at the Victorian railroads and so on - even the colonisation was private with the East India Company (although that did become a viceroyalty) but the South African Company stayed private under Rhodes etc.

I'm not talking about specific industries, but a country's trade and industrial policies, such as infant industry protection and export subsidies.

While many people hold the view that Western countries were using the type of free-market liberal economic policies which make up the Washington Consensus, development theorists such Ha-Joon Chang claim that's the ‘the orthodox view of capitalism’s history’, which is incorrect (check out his book *Kicking Away The Ladder* for more).

&gt;Central planning hasn't worked out so well (see: USSR).

[But it has in Malaysia, Botswana, Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, Indonesia, China and Thailand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_state) ([see this article by Adrian Leftwich](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7660.1994.tb00519.x/abstract)). [Here's an interesting TED talk on the China model](http://www.ted.com/talks/eric_x_li_a_tale_of_two_political_systems?language=en), which has been incredibly effective at economic development, whilst completely going against the Washington Consensus.

&gt;Democracies involves in free trade are the least likely to go to war as it damages prosperity for all. It is the way to a fairer, more peaceful world.

That's debatable, perhaps in some countries.

People here think Cameron is exceptionally right wing, but he is not in relative terms. Compared to Abbott in Australia, Key in New Zealand, the Republicans (and even most Democrats) in the States or Harper in Canada and the Conservatives here historically, Cameron is the most progressive and liberal. He has attempted to modernise the party, introduced same sex marriage, and generally speaking isn't as Tory as most of the right of the country. Add into this the fact that large numbers of his activists are really pissed off at him as they haven't been 'paid' with a repeal of the hunting ban, a vote on the EU, or increased defence spending. He doesn't like talking about immigration, he has failed to do what he said he would do on the subject and he is as out of touch on the subject as anyone else. The party isn't offering the sort of tax breaks and popular privatisation that they used to, and Cameron himself represents the archetypal elite of the country rather than the common man.

The result are millions of people who are traditionally right wing who feel alienated by the Tory party. People who don't like Gay Marriage, want their taxes to be cut, and all of the other archetypal tory things, but they don't think the Tory party represents them.

There isn't another professional, non-racist party that bothers to appeal to them. Labour sometimes tries and fails, but the rest can't even have a conversation with them without coming across as arrogant wankers lecturing them rather than convincing them.

Take last night, all of the parties bar UKIP were on the 'tax and spend, immigration good' left wing consensus and never bothered to even attempt to convince anyone who didn't already accept that view that they were wrong. Instead you have people expressing emotions and anacdotes in place of analysis and argument.

Then there is a fault with foreign policy as well as military expenditure. Aggressive military action is abhorrent and the culture of invading for the 'good cause' needs to be changed. Reducing military capability is a step in the direction towards being a more peaceful and respectable country. 

&gt; Having a force that outweighs Argentina doesn't exclude having a bigger one, having a larger force could reduce the length of the conflict, or could be a big enough threat to prevent one all together, or at least postpone it.

Argentina is rank 47th in military expenditure. UK is ranked 5th. I think that is enough. In numbers, that translates to Argentina spending £4.3bn/yr on defense, while we spend £51.5bn. We comfortably beat them in terms of available aircraft, sea vessals, ground vehicles, and available manpower.

The last time around, the Falklands War lasted a mere ten weeks - since then UK military spending has skyrocketed to the point that it is likely any invasion by Argentina would be decimated within a month, with a massive lose of life and dignity for Argentina as well as the ever-present risk of massive crippling international sanctions that comes with being on the bad side of a US ally.

A lot of politics has become mud-slinging, we see it often and in a way I don't think most of our mainland europeans would ever accept. 

My main concern about the rise of UKIP and other right-wing movements is just how poor the opposition to them is in it's standards and approach. Kneejerk reactions don't add anything to any debate and the left, which I consider myself a member of, needs to consider a little more soul searching especially when it comes to finding out just why it's lost working-class support to movements like this. The old political saying ""The right looks for converts, the Left looks for traitors."" has never been more true, and in suggesting that I could be labelled a traitor. 

There's another more worrying part to simply crying ""racist"" to any dissent, aside from discouraging dissent and cheapening the sorry experience folk suffer from racism, and that lies in the future. Should a smart fascist movement arise it'll not be stopped by insult, and with no stronger arguments it may not be stopped at all.

To be honest, I dislike that argument very much, because it assumes that people are voting UKIP out of ignorance. It implies that people would have a more welcoming view of immigrants, if they only interacted with more of them for long enough. When in fact they may very well be voting UKIP out of fear that their area might change for the worse, if large-scale immigration started to effect them. Now you may say that those fears are irrational, but are they really? If you look at Switzerlands referendum, where support for the curb of immigration was highest in the areas with the lowest number of resident foreigners, your argument was put forward as well.

The very idea that you legitimately think Russia would attack us is beyond retarded, I hope you know.

* There's been such a surge for the SNP that in many seats they've all of a sudden gone from no hope to first place. It was always the case that the SNP did poorly in General Elections and were not a credible choice for a tactical vote. That's all changed dramatically.
* Support for the Labour in Scotland is still very high. However with FPTP that support doesn't matter unless they have 1 more vote than the SNP in a constituency
* The Labour have lagged badly behind in what needs to be done in Scotland. They needed to separate from Blairite labour and while being supportive, be distinct. They show some signs that it might happen but it's 10 years too late.

I mean you could say the same for the Tories (in the last 30 years) and the south east of England. It seems like the SNP's strategy is to get more of the pot for Scotland at the expense of other places and that an independent scotland would've had austerity in the short and medium term, I'm not sure if this is a reason to split up.

null,false,newosis,null,null,null,"Hi,
Small business owner here who also successfully gained funding :)

OK, so there are a few places you could look for investment. As someone has already mentioned the Princes Trust could be a good place to start. They are more focussed on young people from I remember, but you could well be in their catchment.

My top tip would be to look for what grants are available. There are a massive amounts of Government grants available to small businesses and I would look there first. Here's a handy tool for you:

https://www.gov.uk/business-finance-support-finder

Next thing to do is to contact your local council, there are also grants and schemes (such as free business advise or mentoring) available at a local level.

Once you have exhausted these options I would start looking to local business people for help. I am in London where there is a strong investment community, I have no idea about where you live but if there are successful businesses there will be people looking to invest. This would be my next port of call.

Next plan would be to then look at some of the new P2P funding schemes that are available. Things like Funding Circle. These can be a good option but they do carry risk. If your business fails you may still have personal liability for the debt.

Finally once you've exhausted every other available (and sensible!) option, would I look to the bank. You're not likely to get any money off them without something to put up against it.

Final note, I would not take investment off family and friends. I turned down some offers from family as all new business are a risk and the only people you should allow to invest are those who can afford to lose it. Investment in a new business is a punt, it's never a sure thing.


I'm sure lots of other people will have some great ideas I have missed as well, this is just what I've investigated :)

There were millions of people watching who either see globalisation as a threat to their way of life, immigrant children distracting the teacher from their kids, the social housing ladder going up, their A/E waitiing times increasing or see their fatally ill grandmothers medication being stopped because it isn't value for money. They have lived through fifteen years of New Labour and the Coalition and don't believe a word the politicians say. Why the hell should they believe Natalie Bennett or Leanne Wood when they talk about an academic study they havent seen or read? Those are politicians who primarily want to get elected and appeal to their left wing bases, they don't give a crap about the people in the leafy shires and they are just like the Lib Dems, opportunistic liars. 

Thats how my parents, brother, and their friend circles all respond.

They aren't racists. They are scared. And rather than telling them that they are right to be scared, that they are safe, and that they will be cared for, the left just tells them they are morons to be scared and that the alternative is even more scary. They feel attacked just for saying how they feel, and they are frequently mocked and derided for it on the tv, media, everything else (other than the Mail, obviously, which is telling them the truth, unlike the BBC propaganda). 

People who want to vote UKIP are people. They can be racists. They can be dicks. They can be sexist. But they can also be nice, charitiable, kind, considerate, and generous. What they need is for people to engage with them properly, not to judge them, and not to make them feel like they are inferior or bad for talking about the issue that matters to them.

But that would be difficult, and they live in the Tory areas, so no-one bothers. They just get left to fester for twenty years driving the Tories even more right wing and Labour desperately more populist.

Then what are the effects of immigration that cause support for UKIP? UKIP say immigrants have taken British jobs. That's obviously not true in areas with no immigrants. UKIP say immigrants drive down labour costs. If its legal, that's hard to see in areas without immigration. If its illegal (i.e. immigrants being paid below minimum wage), then the solution is punishing the employer that breaks the law, not kicking out the immigrant.

The Swiss example is interesting. A comparison might be London, where the majority are being priced out by wealthy foreigners. Yet UKIP aren't combatting this.

The Outdoor Cinema has been in the pipeline for a few months now and the initial Facebook events had been planned to be launched in a few weeks. Over the weekend we’d seen a similar event launch so we felt it was important to get our events out as soon as possible so as not get left behind as the busy summer months kick in.

Launching the Facebook &amp; social media channels was for us to gauge interest in the concept so we could scale and plan each event accordingly. Each event that happens as part of The Outdoor Cinema is going to be bespoke to each location – why we ask people to choose their favourite films when signing up.

**Can you tell us why at the time of publishing the blog post, the Facebook pages and the website was not represented by any company? Meaning, there was no company registered?**

As previously mentioned we hadn’t planned to launch this week, We registered the company at the start of the week but due to a administrative error on our part this was delayed (I have sent you proof of this.) A small error, but very badly timed for us…

Initially the events were planned to be run on private owned licence venues or via Temporary Event Notices. Discussions have been going on this week with certain councils and now looking at larger venues in order to meet the expected demand.

**Do you have any venues confirmed for the events, as of right now?**

We do have events pencilled for a run of dates but we are revisiting each site on an individual basis to evaluate their capacity and suitability in response to the increasing demand for each location.

**I’ve received e-mails claiming that you’re connected with other events on Facebook, such as the Wipeout Events and even events pages for Radio 1 big weekends setup in different cities. Can you confirm if you, your team or any of the companies you are involved with are running any other events currently on Facebook?**

I can categorically state that none of these events have anything to do with us or any of the team.

I’d also like to state we are nothing to do with Moonlight Cinema, The Open Air Cinema and any other events that have subsequently popped up.",null,0,null,1429294822,null,0,false,0,cqfq4ql,null,t3_32wdcj,null,t1_cqfq4ql,null,t1_cqfpzmq,null,null,null,1432449168,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

The main concern I'd have with you is that as a person with disabilities, you have a shitload of rights afforded to you by the [Disability Discrimination Act](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/13/section/13), which could potentially put your needs and costs vastly above only the general maintenance stuff I'd need to fund for fully able tenant. You offer no info about your disability, but it could be one that might make me liable to pay out tens of thousands to service you as a tenant, and, obviously, that's something I'd want very much to avoid. 

This puts you in a difficult position. 

I can't really offer any advice from your side of the coin, but what you might want to do is to reconsider how you approach telling people about your disability. The first change I'd make is to stop presenting yourself as a 'disabled person'. Flip it around - you're a person first and foremost, and while your disability may define your needs, it does not define you, and the sort of prejudice you experience can be diminished by making that distinction. Secondly, how are you presenting your disability? Do you even need to present it at all? If it isn't something that would affect my obligations to you, it isn't something you need to mention. If your disability does affect my obligations to you, how much work and expense would catering to your needs be? If it's trivial, I'm sure you could come to an arrangement. 

If you do have a more severe disability that would require significant investment on a private landlord's part, you're perhaps best getting into social housing. Google for your local council, and see what they can offer you.

Then you need to slowly sell the most lucrative contracts off to private companies to further exacerbate the problem with the government controlled social side.

I'd say we're fairly well through stage 2 and some early adopters have already started on phase 3. The final phase will likely come about in about 20 years or so.

I looked it up, and it appears that there are some charities which give free bus tickets to refugees, since they're unable to work whilst their asylum claim is assessed. 

Not only did I get downvoted for stating this, I got attacked by a rabid kipper (who's shadowbanned) asking ""Do you have any facts or are just making excuses?"" and all sorts of ranting shit too crazy to respond to.

The *facts* appear to be that free bus tickets are given to refugees by charities (the [Refugee Survival Trust](http://www.rst.org.uk/what-we-do/bus-pass-fund-pilot-project)
and the [Refugee Council](http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/services/2869_assist_asylum_seeker_support_initiative)), but many kippers are the kind of people who are unsatisfied by facts, and who ignore them if those challenge their preconceived worldview.

In fact that's why I requested /r/UKIP, because I gave up trying to have adult discussions with kippers.

I wish I could say this guy wanted the government to prohibit charities from providing assistance to refugees - I mean, I wouldn't think that sensible, but it would at least be grounded in reality. In this case he ignored the links I'd provided as evidence, and just went off on a load of unrelated shit.

I have bags of sympathy for the original guy who asked the question, by the way - the guy who can't afford for his kids to ride the bus. Both him and his wife work, he said.

It's worth mentioning that if you think racial prejudice is unfair and a problem, you're probably not the kind of person I was directing this at.

null,false,jrushton2,null,null,null,"&gt;  E.g. gay marriage causing floods, Farage saying he'd prefer to privatise the NHS or scrap laws on colour discrimination.

None of these are scandals. I'd love to know why the left have such a huge fear of moving to a private health insurance system. If it wasn't for the constant propaganda from Labour and left wing press in this country we could actually have some major reform of the NHS. Maybe in another decade when people truly realise what a bureaucratic nightmare our healthcare system is. But not so long as the left continue to scaremonger about muh privatization. I must admit I was disappointed with the manifesto launch when UKIP caved in to popular pressure and promised no major reform of the healthcare system. It seems no party is willing to offer an alternative; they are all content with the status quo because of the above reason.

As for the gay marriage causing floods, that's really irrelevant. We can list countless examples of councillors from the other parties who  have acted in a far worse manner, the problem of course is the press don't bother reporting on it (e.g. Jon Larson, the Lib Dem councillor found guilty of a bombing campaign). These nutjobs aren't representative of the party, and as the party has established itself more in the last 5 years candidates are being properly vetted. 

Lastly, I agree with Farage on removing laws relating to discrimination in employment practises. The state should not dictate who individuals conduct their business with. This is a moral principle, because I'm sure you're now going to argue from a legality POV that they have an obligation to serve everyone, which is missing the point.

* Labour held the first two governments in Holyrood, running a coalition with the Lib Dems.
* The SNP have been in power at Holyrood since 2007. Once as a minority administration then winning a majority in 2011.
* Those two administrations went a long way to making them be seen as competent politicians rather than a single-issue party.
* They could probably have expected to see that success start to filter through to General Elections, just not so dramatically.
* Anti-Westminster feeling has grown significantly post-referendum; the Conservatives unveiling EVEL the day of the result managed to make Labour (Scottish or otherwise) look inept and the SNP look prescient.
* Salmond really isn't in charge any more. He's been sent south to troll the media.
* Both Scottish Labour and the Scottish Conservatives have had senior figures (former First Minister for Labour, runner-up to Ruth Davidson for Conservatives) float the idea of splitting from the UK party.
* Johann Lamont was probably forced out by Jim Murphy, however her parting shot was along the same lines (""Labour must recognise that the Scottish party has to be autonomous and not just a branch office of a party based in London"").
* Whatever you might think of Len McCluskey, pretty much every prediction he's made about Jim Murphy being ""[a political death sentence](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/mccluskey-jim-murphy-a-death-sentence-for-labour-1-3604463)"" has come to pass.
* Labour MPs who lose their seat this time round will need to decide if they hang around doing nothing for five years, or try and usurp existing Labour MSPs in the next Holyrood election in 2016. For all the dysfunction there's been to date, there's a lot of potential for in-fighting still to come.
* The SNP care much less about this election than they do the next few decades. Labour were the ""default vote"" in large parts of Scotland for decades, and Sturgeon's goal is to put the SNP into that position - not to force another referendum.
* If there's one thing the SNP have done right, and pretty much every other party in Scotland has done wrong, it's to play the long game.

edit:

* It's difficult to understate just how angry some Labour supporters felt about seeing Labour and the Conservatives working together during the referendum. Watching the Scottish Conservatives give Alistair Darling a standing ovation was not how they expected things to work.

Remember too, that the SNP's policies are decided upon by the membership. Clearly in the '70s that membership was considerably more right wing if they dismissed the '79 group?

As for the tories in Scotland I think they're pretty much irrelevant to what's happening, although they have their own story going on. I think they're a much better opposition than the labour, I like Ruth Davidson at FMQs. 

I also like the idea of a socially liberal, faintly right of centre party that will do practical policy rather than ideological choir preaching. The LibDems are of course the closest to that but I welcome the Scottish tories splitting from the English side of things and becoming a proper Scottish party and distancing themselves from the divisive identity politics and vilification of the poor that the Westminster party does.

The tory vote in Scotland is pretty much unchanged by what's going on and all that's really going to happen is they may lose to the SNP a bit more, or they may even take a seat or two if the SNP erode the labour enough for them to steal it.

If Labour lose a seat to the SNP it's bad, but it's only half as bad as losing one to the Tories in England -- such would create a swing of 2 seats instead of 1.

To outflank the SNP to the left they'd have to put forward some significant policies, which they think would cost them English marginals.  Especially since a significant number of English voters already think Scotland has it too good and would hate to see more concessions.  We can see UKIP trying to capitalise on this anti-Scottish sentiment recently.

There are 59 seats in Scotland and 533 in England.  At this stage the Scottish seats are probably considered lost causes, but even a couple of months ago when they could've challenged it probably wasn't deemed worthwhile to destroy your strategy for hundreds of English seats in the hopes of winning 20-30 in Scotland.  Scotland has a minimal electoral impact in most elections.

Finally, Labour doesn't understand what's happening in Scotland *at all*.  They genuinely seem to think a wave of fanatical nationalism has blinded half the country.

Yes, I think in the context of this GE they're not really significant. Personally I would say Davidson is on a par with Sturgeon - she's smart and articulate and while you may not agree with everything she says you do believe she's put some thought into it. She asks solid questions at FMQs and she impressed me at the debates.

&gt; I also like the idea of a socially liberal, faintly right of centre party that will do practical policy rather than ideological choir preaching. The LibDems are of course the closest to that

If you say so… ;)

&gt; but I welcome the Scottish tories splitting from the English side of things and becoming a proper Scottish party and distancing themselves from the divisive identity politics and vilification of the poor that the Westminster party does.

I think this is probably what will happen. The ""small-c conservative"" strand of conservatism is very much alive and well in Scotland, the ""financial success above all else"" brand that's emerged Thatcher onwards is their real problem up here.

null,false,heyhelloheyhey,canada,Canada,null,"I'm Canadian and an immigrant myself from South Asia. I love Canada's multiculturalism and love how talking ill of immigration is a taboo topic in Canadian politics (unlike it is anywhere else I've investigated). I do have concerns from what I have heard that some of UKIP's members and definitely some of UKIP's supporters are racists and bigoted BUT I don't think Nigel Farage nor UKIP's actual policy is racist -- in fact I think their policies make a lot of sense.

This might be surprising to hear but even in immigrant loving Canada, the idea of uncontrolled immigration is something that would not be tolerated. Like if there was a North American Union (oh god that sounds awful) and immigrants from the US and Mexico were coming into Canada without any account or any ability to say no, I would consider that a real problem. I want Canada to have a compassionate refugee policy and very open immigration policy but I want the Canadian government to be the one making the decision on whether a person can enter Canada.

Another aspect that is troubling about immigration to the UK is the fact many immigrant workers seemed to be abused by employers in an attempt to drive down wages. Our current conservative government has attempted the same turn. Instead of the usual system whereby almost all immigrants come in as automatic permanent residents with full rights and who have to either go through a points system to prove their economic worthiness or be sponsored by family already here, the government began to allow in a majority of newcomers as unskilled Temporary Foreign Workers (TFW) who were dependent on their employers to stay in Canada. The system was HIGHLY abused. Employers preferred the TFWs because they could be coerced into low wages and reliability etc. Our public broadcaster eventually exposed the abuse in a series of investigations which showed how the system hurt both resident workers by keeping wages down and TFWs by keeping them as second class people. The government is now curtailing (though not abolishing) the entire program but is doing the worst thing possible to the TFWs already here by trying to deport the hundreds of thousands of people who have been living here for close to 10 years. This move unfortunately seems to have general support among the population too despite the huge human toll because of the negative impacts of the TFW program and dark mark it has left in many people's views of immigration to the country.

So the point of that rant is, the current EU free movement system the UK has, feeds these issues --- the fact that migration cannot be controlled, and the fact that migration can be of a lot unskilled people who don't have the same rights as resident workers (especially if they are undocumented). UKIP's plans address both these points (from what I can tell) and will likely (if handled correctly) result in a more immigrant friendly nation.

EDIT: Let me add that some of UKIP's policies regarding immigration are bad. Particularly the ones that would prevent immigrants from having the full rights of other residents (not talking about citizenship rights here) like access to universal healthcare etc. The best way to build a united society is to treat everyone the same once they are here.",null,0,null,1429299912,null,0,1429300446,0,cqftbch,null,t3_32xfo3,null,t1_cqftbch,null,t3_32xfo3,null,null,null,1432450668,null,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10,null

Ramps aren't exactly cheap - a quick google around seems to bring up costs of around [£1560](http://www.wheelchair-ramps.co.uk/modular.html) for a semi-permanent model, which excludes any costs associated with installation. 

How much things actually cost is almost a moot point, though. What the OP's suffering from isn't landlords and agents taking into consideration the expenses and the benefits of taking on a disabled tenant and deciding that the B:C isn't up to snuff, it appears to be a kneejerk discriminatory reaction, based on fear.

Examples include:

* A costed plan to cut the deficit and generate a government surplus through getting a grip on responsible spending. This means living within our means - We cut the lies and inconsequential feel-good rhetoric regarding borrowing / spending, so as to ensure the country does not fall to its knees like it did in 2008 and once again cripple the lives of many working class citizens.

* A commitment to increase defense spending in order to honour our 2% GDP N.A.T.O. requirement. To avoid this issue is to take our vital alliance with the U.S.A. for granted - A manipulative and naive thing to do in the face of rising militarism from Russia and China. It is also worth recalling ""Peace in our time"" - Should one not be familiar with the context in which this was said, one should have no say over whether or not it is appropriate to cut military spending.

* A willingness to see electoral reform, a route simply not possible under a Labour / Conservative government for whom the current system is so vital for power. The fact is that while FPTP has its merits, it is simply too crushingly unfair in many cases. Take today. U.K.I.P. currently has over twice-to-three times the national voting share of the S.N.P, and yet the S.N.P. are set to win almost 40x the seats. We must therefore strike a better balance between earning power through constituency support, and earning power through national support. 

* A willingness to stop the completely unfair scrutiny that non-European immigrants face compared to their European counterparts. People should be allowed to live in this country based on merit, not based on where they were born. Our current immigration model is arguably therefore, quite racist against non-Europeans.

* A rethinking of the Barnett formula. This is an outdated funding system denounced at this point by even Barnett himself, and yet we keep it...Why? One can only presume there are those in power who would see the rest of the U.K. see unfair treatment in their bid for continued time in office. It is a corrupt mentality that serves only to benefit the political class, and not our United Kingdom as a whole.

* A free and fair referendum on whether or not the U.K. should continue with political integration in to the E.U. Our transition in to the union thus far has been undemocratic and the peoples of this nation deserve a say, once and for all, to settle the issue - Are we in, or are we out? Personally I will be very pleased whatever the outcome, even if it means staying in the E.U. All I want to see is not necessarilly a split from the European Union, but a democratic decision by the people - Not the government - On whether or not the continued passing of powers from London to Brussells is in our interest. If it is, I will gladly support that consensus, proud that our peoples have finally made an indisputably democratic decision for the future direction of this country.

* A willingness to re-engage with the gargantuan Anglo market that is the Commonwealth. Why have we turned our backs on the biggest legacy the U.K. has ever left in her history? Common language, culture, political and economic systems means that a drive to pursue re-integration (Particularly in the economic sense) could lead to the U.K. building new jobs, trade opportunities, and global alliances - All of which are important in what is a dramatically shifting geopolitical and economic global landscape.

* Support for grammar schools. To denounce this branch of education is to cloud your vision in the name of political correctness, and see the social divide between the rich and the poor grow ever larger. How do you expect standardised public schools to ever compete with private schools? Grammar schools bridge the gap and lead to better social mobility, regardless of the short term emotional impact it will have on little Timmy should he not qualify in the entrace exam. 

* A support for the continuation of trade with Europe, regardless of the U.K's answer to the European question. Choosing to leave political union with the European Union will have no effect on our ability to trade with them. In fact, should the U.K. leave, it will actually see a range of new trade opportunities with the world open up due to the lifting of E.U. restrictions.

In the 90's trolling wasn't newsworthy because hardly anyone used the internet - [this chart](http://i.imgur.com/yGLazjM.jpg) says 20% by 2000.

Off the left edge of that chart's scale is that internet usage arose from near zero in 1995, whereas today the internet is totally ubiquitous.

When I was a kid no-one had mobile phones, and practically everyone allowed their landline number  to be listed in the local directory. 

Back then everyone knew that you could be arrested if you persistently made nuisance phonecalls. 

Today if you go on twitter and make death threats then idiots on Reddit will defend your right to ""free speech"". No, Gaz, it's not ""free speech"", it's abuse and harassment, just like it's always been, and you could be arrested for it in the 70's and 80's if you were a persistent ""telephone troll"" back then, too.

As I was composing this I realised that back in the 70's and 80's celebrities were probably amongst the few people who allowed their phone numbers to go unlisted in the phone book. Social media has better blocking functions, but nevertheless I can't help thinking that celebs may stop using Twitter as they do now, once the honeymoon period is over.

Generally with events organising the costs are high and the profit margins are very narrow, you have to be a *really* big player to be making any serious money. For everyone else it's just about breaking even at the end of the night. 

I have various record labels and music promotions outfits I've freelanced for on my CV and people assume they must be these really slick, formidable organisations, when in reality you can get a heck of a lot done with one laptop and a bit of creativity.  

There's one such outfit I helped set up with a few friends and we went from putting on gigs in the local pub because our friends in bands wanted somewhere to play, to being reviewed in national newspapers, to having fairly big acts from abroad contact us wanting to be involved and festivals wanting to talent scout for new acts. 

People write to us as if we're Virgin or EMI or Glastonbury festival, but we're not. We all have day jobs and we do everything - from the poster art to the sound checks - ourselves.

I'm an academic working as a postdoctoral researcher. It's an absolutely brutal sector to be involved in and there are people of non-British origin absolutely everywhere. My career is in jeopardy partly because migrants are able to enter my job market just as easily as I can. The type of jobs I can get at the moment typically last a couple of years until I have to find another or try to find funding for my research myself, which is highly competitive. Trying to get a permanent position is many times more difficult.

Further to that, I am wanting to settle down near the rest of my immediate family and begin my own family. Migrant workers from elsewhere arn't constricted by that, they can go anywhere where they can find a job.. they're not particularly fussed if they take an academic post in my area or if it's somewhere else, as long as it's in their area of interest and with good people. So to me, it's a very real threat to my job that EU citizens from all over the place can take any job I apply for near to where I want to live, even though they don't really care for the place.

Now, if you look at it that way, I should be a perfect candidate to vote for less immigration, and I'm not. Why?

That's because I understand that my sector relies on talented people making innovations and progress in order to be successful. Having a pool of people who can easily join us in this country to undertake research (and be involved in educating our students) is a huge advantage and it makes the UK stronger as a result. It also drives, through competition, people who want to be involved in research to do better and try harder.. although that can be to the detriment of your social/family life.

So despite me being potentially worse off and possibly having to leave the field of work I love, I still think that remaining in the EU and allowing immigration is the right thing because the benefits outweight my personal interests.

Now I'm sure some UKIP supporters are racist, but I don't think all of them are.

null,false,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,null,"&gt; What policies would you like?

Personally, scrapping the House of Lords and establishing a written constitution. For many others it would be about economics; rejecting austerity or the need to stick to essentially Conservative economic policies in order to appear ""fiscally responsible"".

However I think that's kind of missing the larger picture. The problem with Scottish Labour is not a lack of policies (Jim Murphy has been coming up with about ten new ones every week for months), it's that those policies simply don't resonate with people in Scotland.

So what would? I don't know, but I suspect ones that were more specifically about Scotland.

We have a chronic problem with alcohol abuse (it costs Scotland £3.5bn a year - the same as England and Wales, who have ten times the population), there's a clear desire for further devolution, there's not yet been a coherent argument for how to recover from the effects of deindustrialisation (a problem that's not unique to Scotland, of course), etc.

The kind of mutterings that are going on at present are things like Labour councillors [registering their own trademark](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/scottish-politics/activists-apply-to-trademark-scottish-labour-party-in-hope-of-break-with-.120139169) for the party name, [Labour MPs speculating](http://ericjoyce.co.uk/2015/03/a-real-scottish-labour-party/) that ""if the SNP secures over 40 seats and labour well under 20, then the unionist game is probably a bogey"", or blog posts [like this](http://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/labours-love-lost-the-problems-for-the-scottish-labour-party/).

If there had been an independent Labour Scotland party, and if it had thrown its hat into the independence ring or even for devo-max, then I think we'd be looking at an entirely different situation today.

As it stands, people have simply left Labour - continuing on the same path won't bring them back.

&gt;At the moment I just get the same feeling from Nichola Sturgeon as I did with April 2010's Nick Clegg. They even have similar first names.

Did you know that David Cameron also spells ""Craned Ma Void""? What kind of feeling does that give you?

The main difference for Sturgeon is that, in Scotland, she's been part of the government since 2007. Her support in Scotland is drawn far more from that than a pre-election Clegg-mania (not to deny that she's had a significant boost in profile since Salmond stepped down, but even during the referendum she was far more the public face of the SNP).

&gt; With the exception of the last one, I could see all those policies in a conservative or Tony Blair 2005 manifesto. Tax breaks, council tax freezes, apprenticeships and a giveaway to boot. What makes the SNP different?

They're in favour of increased immigration, removal of nuclear weapons, a less splenetic relationship with the EU, a very ambitious target for renewables (partly for the energy, partly for the engineering), and any number of other things.

Like all parties, there's considerable overlap with whoever's been successful recently - but I think it'd be a mistake to assume they're essentially ""New Labour done right"".

&gt; At the moment Tony Blair has won the most Scottish seats for Labour in history.

I think ""history"" is probably the relevant word there.

You work in digital marketing, surely you should know that deleting things just sparks a Streisand Effect of drawing in even more bad publicity.

You should have let the tweets stand, and continue to take any hits on the chin from references to them. That's part of the penance for being so wrong about this.

I can't help but feel that you very quickly jumped to conclusions too, particularly on the part of not getting an immediate explanation from them on twitter. They are not necessarily obligated to respond quickly, especially as it was after office hours (6.30pm or so) when you first messaged them, and not to someone who so clearly regarded them as a scam.

With regards to the company address from the whois lookup, that was also very poor, rushed research. It took me all of 30 seconds to streetview the address, see the KSL company at that house number and google their website. Turns out they are an accountant and business advisor, which makes it very clear why so many companies have their address there. It's very common practice.

I'm glad you've taken responsibility for your mistakes, but there should be more of a mea culpa by leaving up those mistakes for everyone to see.

There's also a rather large and very cynical part of me that connects your digital marketing job with publicising this outdoor cinema. I really hope that's not the case, but I wouldn't be surprised if it is.

[This seems to be a fun article on both HSV types.](http://www.herpes.com/hsv1-2.html) I'll quote a couple of paragraphs which might set your mind at rest a little:

&gt;A third factor influencing the frequency of HSV -1 and 2 outbreaks is whether the virus is established in its site of preference. While HSV can infect both genital and oral areas, both types cause milder infections when they are away from ""home"" territory. Outside their site of preference, both type 1 and 2 lose most of their punch.
&gt;For example, most people infected with HSV-1 in the genital area have few, if any, outbreaks after the initial episode, far fewer than is typical with either oral HSV-1 or genital HSV-2. While experts estimate that some 30% of genital herpes infections in the United States may be caused by HSV-1, only 2- 5% of recurring genital outbreaks are caused by HSV-1. Research conducted by Lawrence Corey, MD, and colleagues at the University of Washington in Seattle shows that genital HSV-2 recurs 10 times more often than genital HSV-1.

The other two factors are the state of your immune system (if your immune system is good, you'll have fewer outbreaks) and the length of time you've had it (outbreaks usually drop off over time).
I picked up oral HSV1 when I was 20 and have had very few outbreaks over the following 22 years, usually when I'm fighting off another infection at the same time.

For a direct answer, from experience, offering no facts or figures, the attitude to HSV1 in particular is that it really is NBD at all, to the point where you can have ""the talk"" with a potential partner and the response will be less than a shrug and ""meh"".

I've had the debate with a few young Americans on Reddit before and I can totally reassure you that, despite what they'll tell you, it's not a death sentence, it's not a reason to become an asexual hermit, it's just....well...nothing.

Treatment is only really necessary if you have a breakout and it's widely available in both oral and topical applications. There's various drugs which all end in ~clovir. You can pop into any pharmacy or sexual health clinic and get much more specific and professional advice with no shame or stigma at all.

We knew nothing of the events and we were chuffed that we'd won the semi and that we'd booked our place to Wembley courtesy of a Pat Nevin goal. 

All the joy we had soon disappeared when we got back to the coach and and heard radio reports of approx 15 deaths at the Liverpool/Forest semi, you need to remember this was pre mobile phones and we had no way of knowing if our Liverpool supporting mates were ok. 

We had to collect some of our coach party from the local police station as they'd been arrested before the game for high jinx (shoving a rolled up Everton flag up a police horses arse, if I recall correctly!!) The police station was mobbed with Everton fans outside trying to get their mates out too (Being a football fan in the 80's, meant being subject to real heavy handed policing, and people got arrested for silly thing like swearing or looking at a copper in the wrong way) All the Everton fans were worried about their mates, by this time the radio was reporting about 30 deaths. I remember my Dad demanding to see a senior policeman, and remonstrating with him, insisting he release the horse flag fellas, whilst  my dad was arguing with the copper telling him that we just want to get home and see if our mates are ok, a big fellow blue behind us leaned over and said ""I've now seen 6 of you fuckers go through that security door and I know the fucking code to get in, if you don't get all of our fucking mates out of there now, we're fucking coming in to get them"" The coppers face went white and he got the Sergeant. About 5 mins later all the Everton fans who'd been nicked had been released and we headed back up the M6, on the journey back home the death toll just kept rising and rising with every news bulletin. 

We got back to our local pub and met up with our Liverpool mates who'd been at Hillsborough, luckily non had been killed but two had been hospitalised. Football didn't seem important anymore, the outrage on Merseyside when the press started slating the Liverpool fans was palpable.

He was bought to play in Rodgers' possession/death by footy style of play. His position in that system was on one of the wings as a sort of Kuyt replacement. Great workrate, great movement and a decent finisher. Look at his Roma highlights, the kid was (maybe still is) talented. Then he got injured. During that time Rodgers abandoned the strict style of possession and chose a more direct approach to suit Coutinho, Sturridge and Suarez. The direct approach relied massively on pace, accurate passing and ball control. All attributes that Borini doesn't offer at the level we required. 

After coming back from injury it was clear that Borini couldn't get past either Sturridge or Suarez. He's not as quick as Studge and not as bat shit crazy as Suarez so his place in the team was non existant. The wings were also occupied by Coutinho, Sterling, Downing and occasionally Hendo. 

Last season he got loaned out with the intention of selling him after the season and it seemingly worked out perfectly. Sunderland was willing to pay big money for a player surplus to requirements and LFC was happy to sell. Fabio however, wanted to stay.

Whilst spending profligately isn't a great idea, the intense focus on the deficit doesn't seem to mirror the concerns of *actual economists*... but it seems to be an easy thing to paint a target on to score some political points for ""making tough decisions"", which just so happen to also further certain ideological goals when it comes to shrinking the welfare budget and the role of the state in public services.",null,0,null,1429308523,null,0,1429308892,0,cqfxtaz,null,t3_32yukv,null,t1_cqfxtaz,null,t3_32yukv,null,null,null,1432452798,null,38,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,38,null

Hmm... where can we lay our hands on 1.1 billion quid? Well, there are these printing presses over here... Long-term this isn't sustainable - the ""free"" money makes its way back into the economy, devaluing the pound and causing inflation, and the people we lent the money to remember and want more money next time - but short-term, say when recovering from a truly unprecedented crash in the world economy, it's fine.



&gt;This, by the way, is why any comparison to Greece or any other Eurozone nation is entirely pointless. Greece don't have a printing press, the Germans have it, and they're not going to fuck up their own economy to help out the Greeks, European Ideal or not. It's also why debt-to-GDP is completely and totally pointless as any kind of indicator when comparing us to the Eurozone. We can use our printing press to grow our economy, through investment in infrastructure, R&amp;D, and all that sort of fun stuff. We don't need to shrink the debt side if we grow the GDP side.



&gt;The next important difference between sovereign debt and household debt is cost - bond yields (the equivalent of an interest rate - basically we auction off bits of paper that are effectively IOUs saying ""We'll pay whoever owns this bit of paper x million pounds on y date, and the difference between that face value and the amount they sell for at auction is basically the interest rate we pay) are spectacularly lower for sovereign debt. Indeed, in times of great financial calamity - like, say, the last 5 years - investors are so desperate for a safe harbour for their money that they are willing to pay more than the face value of the bond for the lack of risk. Just to reiterate, in bold because this is really fucking important, when things are really fucked, we actually pay a negative interest rate. People will give us a million quid now for 990,000 quid later.



&gt;So. National debt - at this point - not an actual issue. However the Tories never let a crisis go to waste. They implant the idea that we have to pay off our national credit card (obviously bloated by evil Labour spending money on mansions for pedophile gypsies, not in a desperate attempt to rescue a financial system that is the darling of the neoliberals from imploding from the inevitable stupidity and unreality at its heart). This idea takes hold and the Tories give a really obvious solution to it - cut government spending! This is an obvious, common-sense, man-on-the-street solution and so is, of course, completely and totally the wrong thing to do. It completely ignores where almost all government spending goes, which is of course straight into the economy - in particular mostly to the poorest members of society, who instantly spend it (the feckless bastards) in local shops, who spend it with local suppliers, who spend it with local wholesalers, generating jobs and tax revenue all the way down the line. Much better to let the rich keep it where they can do good things like it like dumping it into the housing bubble or squirrel it away in the Virgin Islands.


&gt;The net effect of massive spending cuts then is to shrink the economy, shrinking tax revenues, meaning... you're going to love this... we have to borrow more money when we cut spending. It's a lie so spectacularly big that literally nobody ever dares call them out on it. The government's solution to a problem which doesn't actually exist actually exacerbates the problem. MORE CUTS FOR THE CUTS GOD! So why are they doing this? The same two reasons they do everything, and the two central planks of all Tory (of all colour) policy:

&gt;1: More money for us

&gt;2: Fuck you



&gt;Spending cuts have only one real effect - concentrating money into the hands who already have it. This isn't a matter of opinion, it's simple fact. When pressed on this Tories will either say that well actually the people at the top deserve that money or really it's going to help the economy in the long term by getting the nasty inefficient government out of the way of the strivers, but see points one and two and work out which story better fits the observable facts.



&gt;So, what could we as a society actually have done in '08? Good question. The one thing nobody knows is what would have happened if we'd just let it all crash. not even the most lunatic anarchocapitalist says that it would have worked out well - if nothing else pretty much every piece of money and property in the world would have ended up being the subject of three dozen different court cases in as many different jurisdictions trying to work out who actually owns it. What's certain of course is that the poorest would be the most fucked because that's the inevitable conclusion of everything that happens in this world. At best - at best - the whole world would have ended up like Russia in the nineties, with people giving up everything they own for just enough food to live, to the tiny amount of people who actually had ready cash.


&gt;Given that, if we accept that the system needed to be rescued, we could have just done what we always did before - borrow money, inflate ourselves out of the crisis, try to do what we can to cushion the blow as much as possible, and for fucks sake regulate the banking system properly to stop it happening again. So, of course, what we're doing is the exact, polar opposite. We're fucking over the very poorest, saddling ourselves with more debt at worse rates (because the money markets aren't stupid and know that austerity is hurting our ability to repay and so cranking our rates up) and of course rejecting any calls to regulate anything ever.



&gt;When it happens again - and it will happen again - unless something big happens, the next crash will probably take the whole lot down because we've pissed away all our chances to fix it.",null,0,null,1429310658,null,0,false,0,cqfyt6w,null,t3_32yukv,null,t1_cqfyt6w,null,t3_32yukv,null,null,null,1432453268,null,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18,null

They're not racists, because they're not out burning crosses whilst wearing white hoods. But they're very concerned about Romanian crime gangs. And they blame political correctness for Jim Davidson and Bernard Manning not being on the telly any more. And the word nigger's not so bad, because it's just from the Latin, and Latin's a proper British language. There's no need to get so upset about it.

They're not racists, because they've got nothing against people being black or foreign, but don't want them being all black and foreign in a way that might threaten proper British values. Those leftie politically correct councils are giving them money for special classes you know? And they go straight to the top of the housing lists, because the council is too scared of being called racist to do anything else. It's not racist to point that out.

They're not racist, but they're not keen on Moslems, but that's different. And you're not even allowed to call them Moslems, as that's apparently not politically correct these days. And the blacks mostly agree and don't like the Moslems too, so you can see that means they're not racist as they agree with the blacks. 

They're not racist, but they think that that the country lost the war to keep Britain British when all the Sikhs started racing around on motorbikes in their turbans.

&gt; I just want somewhere to live which is a reasonable request.

To be honest, the disability discrimination laws exist just for people like you and me. By creating that law, the government are extending their hand to you. It's up to you to hold that hand.

The law was designed for a situation like this. Don't feel bad taking advantage of that if you're in really bad situation.

&gt;Some advice for you, if you think you will be in my position later on, start looking now. Really. You will get very little assistance from anyone, at all.

Thanks for the advice.

&gt;Mourinho said: “Next season, Ruben will not be a kid in the development process. He will be a first-team player, absolutely ready to play and compete. And we will do the same with two or three players. The older ones will go on loan to play in the Championship, the Premier League, even abroad. It's a process.

What I said is that abuse and harassment has always been illegal, and it remains so irrespective of the medium.

It was illegal in the days of analogue telephones, and it remains so on Twitter.

Assuming I accept your claim that sending someone a lot of tweets isn't harassment because of the block button (which ignores how prolific twitter trolls are at creating new accounts), that doesn't mean that criminal harassment and abuse doesn't happen on Twitter.

Nor does it mean that abuse and harassment magically becomes ""impossible"" on social media, just because you think the internet is somehow different and it should be exempted from all law or reason.

Until a few years ago I was determined in the conviction that we should be able to say whatever we like on the internet, and that this new form of communication represented liberty and the opportunity to rid ourselves from the idiotic constraints of conformity and the easily-offended.

If you'll forgive me for saying so, such attitudes now seem immature to me, now I realise that abuse and harassment are real things, and that protection against them is well established in British law.

Okay so there's a few things.

* Zanza is a UKIP supporter, whereas I am not (you seem to think I am?).

* What does the fact that moderators have the power to ban have to do with anything? Nobody threatened you with a ban.

* /r/BritishPolitics is not a democracy anyway.

&gt;You could look at it as a group of people protesting and speaking out against the government, so the police come in with water cannons to defend the government

Water cannons is an exaggeration for reminding you about the rules on personal attacks. You're also comparing subreddit moderation to running a state, when they're totally different things.

&gt;when in actuality the government could quite easily defend itself by countering the objectives of the protestors through open discussion and negotiation.

You didn't really provide much for me to respond to. You post came across as aggressive for a few reasons:

&gt;Are you trying to be smart? 

&gt;Although looking at your post history, there doesn't seem like much of a point to even discuss it with you.

That's not a constructive way to debate, so I just left it. I didn't think the point you were making was really worth refuting anyway. Zanza saw the post and decided to step in, as the moderators often do. Nobody has given any warnings or threatened anybody with bans. No water cannons used here.

On top of that, the UKIP list is generated by political scientists estimating where people are going to vote strongest to weakest for UKIP in 300 areas. UKIP aren't aiming for 300 seats. This isn't the UKIP list, or an area where real polling suggests strong UKIP support... A light pink on that map, is just the end of the arbitrary 300 figure, and most of the dark purple areas are won with a majority in the thousands or tens of thousands for Lib/Lab/Con. It's not a list of the way people *have* voted, it's a list of where two political scientists theorise UKIP will get the highest # of votes in May.

In the short (really short) term immigration is unambiguously bad. They take jobs, push down wages and use services. If you only had a year to live and didn't care what happened next, you'd want your country to have an extremely restrictive immigration policy.

They start to pay for themselves fairly quickly. After a short while, the demand they inject outweighs their labour input - they create more jobs than they use. Then they are able to take risks and start new buissinesses. After a few years, their tax contributions outweigh the services rendered. It takes over a decade for the housing market to recover, potentially several decades.

So what's important to you? Having a job right now? What about having a slightly better job in 5 years? Do you want to buy a house? Are you highly dependent on public services?

'Regionalist' parties such as the SNP don't tend to blame everything on other people, they just tend to say that things would be better if they had even more control over affairs because they could have a better-managed form of politics. During the referendum the SNP weren't saying that the UK was an evil institution that was forcing them to change their way of life, instead they talked about an independent Scotland working in very close cooperation with the rUK. 

UKIP rhetoric towards the EU, immigration, etc, doesn't really present any solutions that aren't brute-force, overly simplistic misunderstandings of the situation. That's why some people say they are a dangerous influence in British politics, and they get the word ""racist"" thrown at them a lot as it's not inconceivable that they are willing to treat people differently due to their national and racial origin, and indeed have a fear of non-British cultures.

null,false,King_of_Avalon,eu,Croatian,null,"Just briefly, here's a quick breakdown of what the categories are:

**Tier 1**

This is primarily for investors and people of world-class talent. For the most part, you have to be either super rich or one of the most internationally distinguished people in your field to qualify. This is so rare that it doesn't apply to the majority of people.

**Tier 2**

This is your standard skilled migrant work visa. They're extremely difficult to get. In addition to needing to have funds to support yourself, a good level of English and a good educational background, you also need a job offer. But not just any job offer. The employer needs to pay around £1000 to sign up to the Register of Sponsors. This is very time-consuming and involves an audit of the company's HR system and accounts, and I think even includes credit checks of their HR personnel. Then, if they make it onto the register, they pay about £300 to try and get a Certificate of Sponsorship. In order to do this, they have to fulfil the Residential Labour Market test. This typically means that the job in question must have been advertised in a Jobcentre for at least 30 days, so that they can show by way of CVs and interview notes that no other UK or EU citizen was more qualified for the job. In addition, there's a minimum earnings requirement. I don't know what it is at the moment off the top of my head, but it's usually in the vicinity of £20,000 for a single person. There's also a cap on the number of CoS given out each year, so it's not open-ended, and you have to renew it at least once before you qualify for permanent residency (which is after 5 years). 

Right now, this route is so difficult that non-EU/EEA migration has plummeted. Head over to /r/IWantOut and look at some of the [somewhere]-&gt;UK threads. Most of the advice tends to be 'fuck it, go somewhere else in Europe'. The hoops a company must jump through to sponsor a worker are so onerous now that it's just not financially worth it unless you're a senior employee transferring within the same company from an overseas office to the UK. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, it's just the reality. Non-EEA skilled migration to the UK right now is locked down pretty fucking tight.

**Tier 3**

Ostensibly an unskilled work visa. It only exists theoretically on paper since it has never been opened since the Points-Based System properly launched back in 2008.

**Tier 4**

This is the regular student visa category. It only covers education at college and university level. You still need to show proof of funds to cover tuition fees and living expenses and all of that good stuff, plus get a Certificate of Sponsorship from your educational institution. The universities are generally pretty solid, but there's been a concerted crackdown recently on the 'bogus colleges' that sell English language courses as a backdoor to entry to the UK, and rightly so. In fact, they've been pushing so hard that now several universities have actually lost their sponsorship licences due to poor record-keeping. I think London Met was the first and most notable a few years ago, which means that for a time, they couldn't sponsor any student from outside the EU. But the reason they've been cracking down is because a Tier 4 visa does allow you to work - 20 hours a week during term and I believe an unlimited amount of hours outside of term, although that may have been restricted to just 40 hours a week now. It's a nice way for uni students to save up a bit of cash over the summer to piss away later on.

**Tier 5**

This is mainly the Youth Mobility Scheme visa, i.e. working holiday. Whenever you see young Australians in London working in pubs, they're probably on a Tier 5 visa. It's good for 2 years and cannot be extended. There's a few other niche categories in here that apply to very few people.

So those are the points-based visas. Like /u/pityh00r said, each one attracts different point amounts for various attributes like English skills, work experience, where you received your diploma, etc. The other half of this are the non-EEA, non-points based visas. These are mainly: tourist/business visas for people from countries that require them, spouse visas and family reunification, refugees and asylum seekers, some Commonwealth ancestry visas and a few others. There are obviously still eligibility requirements, including *extremely* onerous requirements for the spousal visas now that are destroying families and causing multinational families across the world to curse Theresa May's name every night. But these visas don't have a 'points system' in the sense that the others do, because the points-based visas are primarily economic visas, and the non-points-based visas are mainly family and ancestry visas.

That's a really simplified version and there's a few other things in there that make it hideously more confusing (right of abode, ministry, sportsperson and entertainer visas) but I won't go into that because those also only apply to a few people.

null,false,Psyc5,null,null,null,"&gt; This is wrong, I don't think People who vote UKIP are. This is not something I will call UKIP voters, because I try to put myself in their shoes. Why do they think the way they do?

The problem is it isn't wrong, even your statements of why its wrong show it isn't wrong. 

&gt; The influx of immigrants in the last few years has resulted in dramatic changes in more rural and less diverse areas in just a few years compared to decades in a places like London.

&gt; Change is difficult for anyone and I propose it is change that people fear not the people coming from abroad who are causing the change.

I don't disagree, does anyone? But to just blame immigration for all the woes of the world, not the country, while going through a recession is just ignorant to the reality of the current world, and when that ignorance is based against a different race or group of races (i.e. immigrants) it is known as racism. The global recession caused the majority of these problems, but you can't scape go an technically complex system that people who are wooed by ""It was the immigrants"" will understand, there is a reason Ed Miliband who taught economics at Harvard didn't bring it up when Nigel Farrage obtusely said to all the other candidates they don't understand demand and supply, because it isn't going to get him votes (apparently, it makes me respect him more), but that is really a statement on the intelligence of the average voter of, at least the labour party, if not all voters. 

The reason why Nigel Farrage has the following he does is because part of what he says are true, immigrants are a strain on the NHS, an under funded NHS where there are plans for the conservatives to cut more, you want to know who the real strain on the NHS are, old people, but they vote, so you can't blame them for not dying and living with debilitating illnesses, and morally it would be wrong too.  But that is the actual cause of the strain, an ageing population (plus cuts and a recession), we need immigration to pull the average age in this country down so we can sustain them, and the average British person isn't putting in the hours to do it, the average birth rate in the UK is 1.85, it takes two too tango, anything less than 2 means that there isn't as many young people as old, unless you allow immigrants, who also have high birth rates.

Then you have jobs, are these immigrants taking jobs, they sure are, often low skilled jobs that British people didn't want to do, and often high skilled ones where enough British people weren't sufficiently available, Plumbers, Carpenters, Electricians, all skilled trades that get paid exorbitant rates even with all the immigrants apparently taking their jobs, without those immigrants a Plumbers would be getting paid £100K a year because of basic supply and demand economics. 

Then he makes points like health tourism, should this be allowed, no of course not, is it a national crisis collapsing the system, No, not in the slightest, it is a non-issue to a general election, it is a piece of parliamentary legislation for the back pages of newspapers at best. Then you have thinks like his brown field site idea, largely this has been where the houses have been built already, I am not sure what exactly his plan changed, other than the fancy name. Then there is his policy for scrapping of tuition fees for in need degrees, I actually agree with this, the original purpose (or at least flaunted purpose) of tuition fees was to make a capitalist market, this clearly hasn't worked, it is obvious that Cambridge Uni is better than Kent Uni, yet the fees are the same, all lowering them would achieve is admitting your University, who technically is supposed to provide equal education to all others, isn't as good, so they are all the maximum. 

On defence spending it is all swings and roundabouts really, energy, he actually suggest reviving the coal industry...that is how unformed they are as a political party, it is pretty much send the immigrants home so we can go back to the 60's, no immigrants back then. 

Then you have Europe, he makes some fair points about loss of power to Europe, but Europe and it relatively left wing stance is far better than what the UKIP and Conservatives would get up to left on their own, welcome to the capitalist wet dream police state, America already exists, if you want to live there go ahead, but they don't like immigrants as much as Nigel Farrage so you might not be welcome. Facts are if you are truly right wing authoritarian you are never going to like Europe as an idea, that is the valid point, personally I think a more valid point is the authoritarian right wing isn't actually looking out for average working Briton, and especially not a diverse, multicultural, progressive, and globally economically prosperous Britain.

This was patently false, as Anne very personally knew. 
She spent years investigating what really happened, interviewing countless eye-witnesses, both fans and emergency workers present that day. She appealed the ruling, first domestically and then in the European courts, to no avail. 

And yet, for her Kevin, she never gave up. After 23 years of tireless work, she got to see the ""Truth"" come out as part of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report in 2012. She passed away a few days after the 24th anniversary of the Hillsborough tragedy, her work very much still in progress.

If you ask me, SF should be positioning themselves as the liberal party for young people fed up with old style politics, there was a lot of opportunity to do that that O Muilleoir missed.

Forde was absolutely terrible I thought, it's no surprise no one takes Alliance seriously. They're also older-style than they admit, e.g. a number of MLAs voted against gay marriage if I remember rightly, that's not going to attract any of the liberal non-voters. Forde should've been belting on about the DUP being regressive and old-style and would prop up a racist UKIP-Cons coalition. His only possible seat is East Belfast so he should've been doing everything to attract votes there, including mentioning the pact as much as possible. He could also mention how voting for the DUP makes NI look backwards and causes instability, damaging the economy.

SF should be trying to portray the UUP as the same as the DUP and the rest of the time portray the SDLP as weak-willed and the Alliance as not committed to moving NI forward. They should also be arguing the best deal for NI is in a UI and that NI doesn't matter in Westminster so it doesn't matter they don't take their seats.

SDLP should've been going for practical stuff as well, say they're the only left-wing, nationalist party that can make a difference at Westminster by taking their seats.

And the UUP should just claim the DUP are off the wall and they're the only reasonable unionist voice.
