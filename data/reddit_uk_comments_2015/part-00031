But we cannot be complacent in the presence of those that would distort and threaten the basic principles of democracy by neglecting to highlight their faults.
Just as people express the faults of Labour and the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats andUKIP and even the BNP and Britain First, we cannot allow an exception to this. To remain silent on one party is to open the possibility of being silent in our criticism of all.
Criticism is the first and foremost defence against self serving and unqualified politicians. If we elect to remain silent about ~~UKIP~~ the Greens because of the sheer volume of their fuckups then we are working against the system that will keep fuckups like them out of power. Hopefully.
If ~~UKIP~~ the Greens fucks up every day of the week then it's the duty of the people to be aware of each and every one of those fuckups no matter how big or small. These assholes want to run the fucking country, they deserve the closest possible scrutiny and zero tolerance for mistakes. This is how we treat everyone else, this is how we must treat them.

Compare with a graph of [car ownership in the UK](https://makewealthhistory.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/car-ownership.jpg).  At the end of WW2, the vast majority of people did not have a car.  By the mid-late 60s, most people had a car and the carless were a minority.

Accordingly, the 60s/70s are the period where major road building occurs.  Compare for example the UK motorway network in [1958](http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/chronology/1958.shtml) with that of [1978](http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/chronology/1978.shtml).  At the same, the railways are being famously slashed by the [Beeching cuts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeching_cuts).

This puts far more cars on the roads, and worse, trucks/freight, so innumerable towns that were once ""on the main road"" and benefitted from it (think coaching inns, etc) decided they really didn't want to be on a main road anymore.   So you see a proliferation of bypasses at this time too.

So on the simplest level I think you see this theme cropping up a lot in cultural produce simply because it was a common thing happening at the time the creators were growing up / creating.

If you want to speculate about deeper levels I suppose you could say there's something in there about motorways and traffic representing the modern industrial world, and the people building bypasses around their towns represent the British, or at least 'little Englander', aversion to progress / idealisation of the rural, and so on.

Sturridge is clearly our star striker and should play when fit, aside from being rested.

Lambert gets sub appearances and cup games as he's older, and a more of a plan B.

Origi gets sub appearances and cup games as he's young and new to English football.

Borini/Balotelli have until the end of the season to prove they can be what's essentially our number 2 striker. Second fiddle to Sturridge, sometimes playing with him but being main man when he's injured.

It just so happens that the first team have Mason to do it better, and Kane and Eriksen who do very well despite the tight conditions.

A striker will not solve this, as he would face the exact same problem as our players all are: incredibly stacked boxes we allow to organize perfectly with how slow we are to move forward and pick out men running into space.

As for Page 3, why on earth feminists are choosing to focus more attention on it than FGM is anyone's guess. 


This is what the Women and Equalities minister said:


“We need to ensure that media representation of women reflects the great achievements that women make to business, to families and to society. I’d like to see us providing positive role models for young girls instead of suggesting that women’s contribution is in how they look.” 


I think that's a bit of an insult to women really. Do people really think girls grow up thinking 'I want to be a vet' or 'I want to be a fashion designer', only to look at page 3 and decide they want to get their breasts out? If that's the case, how come there aren't hundreds of thousands of women who apply for a Page 3 job? I mean seriously, there's probably going to be a few hundred people read this topic: how many of you have ever known anyone to say they want to be a Page 3 model?


Fortunately, the Sun did it as a publicity stunt, but it just goes to show how these so called 'liberals' are more intent on covering things up (in this case, literally) than leaving things be.


That's the odd thing about society, especially in the UK. People are more open about things now. Gay people coming out is becoming more common. More people are being open and honest about their sexuality and what they are into, I mean hell, there was a facesitting protest outside of parliament last year!

It was painful to watch from the Northam because it's where all their attacking threat was, and not enough of ours!  

Long's injury looked bad, he ran and took the tackle then went down, hand straight to rib, and just didn't move at all. Really sad because the only time we'd looked dangerous in the second half was when he came on, and we lost it a bit after he left too.  

We wasted far too many good shooting opportunities with poor shots, and also too many chances or possible chances with putting too many passes or wasteful risky passes. Tadic looked off most of the game, occasionally would take a player on and you thought something would come of it, but it would come to nothing and you'd be disappointed.

Moffat has explicitly said that the doctor doesn't call himself the #th doctor, that he only knows how many lives he has until he's out.

Matt Smith, during 'the lodger', calls himself the 11th iteration but that's intended to go along with the fact that he's hiding Hurt's iteration.

So, in the long line of doctors, Capaldi is the 13th iteration, but because a regeneration was spent so that David Tennant could keep his face, he's still kinda the same Doctor, so we call Capaldi 12.

This is my first post on Reddit. Actually my first post on a ""social networking"" site. I work in IT pretty much because I rarely have to deal with people. I have no other social media accounts and I am very nervous about posting this. But let's move on to what is really important.

I learned of West Ham from the movie Green Street Hooligans (please don't hate me) and immediately I needed to learn everything I could about the team that was the bond for the characters. I researched and learned the songs that the supporters would sing and the reason (what I could) that they sung them. I was very interested in learning all I could about the premise of the team and movie. With that being said, football for me was a sport that my beloved Pittsburgh Steelers played. Then it happened...

NBC Sports declared that they would broadcast every Premier League game in the United States. I thought I would check it out and would watch games when I could. And I watched when I could. I watched until the international break and caught a game or two after but pretty much just checked websites to make sure West Ham were safe from relegation (not a nice feeling until this year).

Then a coworker showed me funny pictures from the World Cup after Brazil was beaten by Germany. I asked where he found these pics and he showed me Reddit. He explained Reddit to me and said there's pretty much a subreddit for anything. I looked for a sub for the hammers and found this one. I've been a lurker ever since. Until today. 

I love my Steelers, Flyers, and Phillies, but I've not missed a Hammers game all season. I'm hooked. My true passion is West Ham. I love the way the leagues work and the idea of cups during the season. West Ham and the Premier League have ruined North American sports for me. I am a hammer through and through. I live to watch them and when they don't play I'm here. 

I apologize for the long story (and Green Street Hooligans) but this post made me step out of my shell and reach out to my fellow Hammers. COYI!!!

Shipping to the UK using Regular Mail is really swift. I've ordered from Jolse (their eBay store), RoseRose (their main &amp; eBay store) and Etude House Global and none of my packages have been longer than two weeks (including weekends), the only problem is that the tracking number only works in Korea. Once it boards the plane to France you don't know when it arrives, Royal Mail do not give a toss about your package. On average my packages spend three-four working days in Korea, then three in Europe before it gets to me. 

I'd stick to Standard delivery as Parcelforce *will* charge you £13.50 on top as a handling fee. Plus anecdotally people have mentioned their packages were held up in customs more and inspected fully. So if your package is undervalued, you might get hit with fines/fees for the true cost. 

Also! Read reviews before you order! /r/AsianBeauty has [a list of BeautyBloggers](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/bloggers) so you can search by skin type or interest (skincare/makeup). 

Hope this helps a little!

First of all you are bad, let's not get this twisted, you are not decent, you are not good, you are bad, I know this because you are literally a 3k player and that's all you play, no real scrims, no real tournaments you just play pubs and yet you're still 3k. That would indicate to me and the rest of the world above 80 IQ that you are bad if it's the only dota you play.

Secondly, the first screenshot you provided is of you playing Troll Warlord against Undying? If I have to point out why this is stupid I don't think you should even be allowed on the internet, then you've picked Viper vs QoP almost 5 months ago. Yeah. Ok....Good matchup balance, especially in September. Thirdly, this guy is literally on the SEA ladder are you that stupid that you think beating someone with 500 ping is an achievment?

The second screenshot you send me is of you playing Puck 1v1 against some 6.8k guy, seems legitimate I guess but if you've posted the first two screenshots as ""Proof"" I have pretty good reason to suspect there's something up, it's in a private lobby from last year so I can't see the replay or even the scoreboard for myself. 

On further inspection though, your screenshot looks really really off...

Right so, [this is how your name should look](http://i.imgur.com/cHydxlD.png) and [this is how your's looks](http://i.imgur.com/Zb12VLw.png). I dunno, It's only a cursory glance but it looks like you've just photoshopped together a game, I could be wrong and I apologise if I am but it looks so dodgy.

Anyway, with respect to that game you're 13 CS behind at 8 minutes with a 2 kill advantage and you have 15 GPM more than him after TWO kills. Something seems fishy to me about that :)

So after all that, what we've really discovered that whilst you might not be a liar explicitly, you've omitted some pretty key details about your history and achievements, which is effectively lying, this, I dub you as a liar once again as for all intents and purposes you *are* one.

Well, it concerns me a lot. He is the coach for Liverpool FC, not the coach for ""the players BR likes this month"". And no, maybe he is best buds with Balotelli in the locker room (I doubt it, but I'll humor you), calling out someone in public for their shortfalls isn't the way to lead. That is management 101. 

Since you seem really eager to start listing some shit, I guess Ill respond in kind. 
1) Don't care what his true feelings are. Calling out a player for a deficiency to the media is just going to stoke the fire. BR knows that. The media already make up shit as it is. Giving them more fuel is just sabotaging Balotelli and making sure there is *that* much more criticism of him every day. 
2) Media management is *part* *of* man management. How would you feel if your boss stood up at a company meeting and said, ""MarioMagnifico"" sucks at his job so Im not giving him a raise. Then he went to you and looked all confused about why you were butt-hurt and said, ""Whaa? That wasn't about *our* relationship. That was just how I manage my relationship with the company!"". Yea, bet you wouldnt feel the same. 

Well it clearly isn't the way to ""light a fire"" because BR has been criticizing Mario all season and it hasn't helped. Saying he didn't want him and pointing out all his flaws. 


What is stupid is people acting like these comments don't have repercussions on a players attitude and performance. We gave Mourinho a ton of shit when he made a jab about Eto'o and how he was past his prime. This is the exact same thing.

Yes, why is that though - and are these people correct anyway?

If history has taught us anything, it's that when shit hits the fan things often go downhill very quickly - that certainly extends to periods of relative stability. 
The world is almost certainly going to become considerably more unstable in the coming century unless we pull our collective finger out (and I can't realistically see why nuclear deterrents would get in the way of that.) thanks to resource shortages, it's absolutely crazy to suggest we should get rid of our nuclear deterrent because we 'don't need it' right now. 

Isn't that part of the point though? We have the deterrent because global politics aren't as predictable as we might like and the threat of MAD tends would (you'd hope...) get aggressors to think twice about an attack.

Now, I'm not specifically suggesting no-one seriously considers a war with an aggressive, totalitarian superpower as a direct result of our nuclear deterrent. But on the other hand, I wouldn't be totally amazed it that were the case.

By their very nature, nuclear deterrents might seem like a waste of money on the surface because they don't seem to do very much. But again, that's the point. The fact they don't do very much could potentially be testament to the importance of a deterrent. It's hard to quantify how useful something is when by it's very design it's not supposed to be used for one of it's main purposes - being launched. 

&gt;skirmishes and threats at the margins of Europe aside.


Yes, them skirmishes that have on average left 30 people dead every single day for the past 10 months? 
It almost certainly wasn't intended, but the way that paragraph comes across to me is absolutely abhorrent. The Russian military presence and the wider Crimean crisis aren't some sort of bloody stick fight, it's leaving a wake of absolute devastation. 
Ukraine might be on the other side of Europe, might even be the fringe of Europe. But it's still Europe. And It's absolutely horrible to disregard a conflict that is happening in Europe in such a way.

Kept it to pass on to his descendants.

&gt;- What did the Doctor do with it after Clara gave it to him?

No idea.

Rupert. He would've passed it down to Orson, presumably.

&gt;And my theories:

&gt;- Since time travel runs in Orson's family, maybe he is part Time Lord.

What's your reasoning for this? Time Lords aren't the only people capable of time travel.

&gt; - Could Clara be secretly pregnant with Danny Pink's child at the end of series 8? This would explain why he doesn't kill her when she removes his emotions when he's a cyberman. His instincts are telling him to protect his lineage, which allows him to overpower the cyberman part of him, just like Craig does at the end of Series 6. This child could be the grandfather of Orson Pink. (I say grandfather instead of grandmother, b/c Orson still bears the last name of Pink.)

It was rumoured, although it should have been evident after how much time had passed since we last saw Danny fully human.

Salah was woeful, Drogba was meh, Remi looked quite promising but didn't really do much. The defense looked shaky from the start, Zouma had a good game, but I still can't understand why the fuck he was up front in the last 20 minutes or so. That's how they scored, we had a back 3, with one player horrendously out of form, one great RB, and a youngster who hasn't had much, if any, game time.

I'm really annoyed at the performance, not because we lost, but because we never looked like we truly wanted to win. Nobody was making runs, nobody looked like they really knew what they were doing.

Second half was fucking ridiculous, why Salah wasn't subbed off at the break is beyond me. He gave the ball away so much. All that needed to happen was Salah/Drogba off, Hazard/Cesc on. If that would've happened at half time then things would've been much different. But instead Mourinho decided to wait until it was too late to change it. giving 100% for the last ten minutes doesn't make up for giving 20% the whole game.

Whats even worse is that this was the problem at Liverpool too. That was only a draw (somehow), but the same problems are present. Not holding the ball, or knowing what to do with it, and lapsing in concentration when defending.

And on top of that, the atmosphere at the Bridge was dire. A lack of passion all round really.

His aggressiveness and constant willingness to jump into tackles is something we could use in our defensive mids, but as a CB and captain you must be more composed than that.

Previously, we point to his other CB pairings and say that they need to perform better.  But perhaps its not easy playing alongside someone like Kompany who is very quick to take risks at the back.

At 70 minutes, when it's becoming increasingly obvious that we're not going to get through them on the deck because they're putting 10 men behind the ball at all times, Rodgers ***has*** to bring on Lambert. We don't need to press at that point because we're dominating the game and we need a presence in the box. Lambert was brought in for his domestic experience and the fact he's a fucking great header of the ball, leaving him on the bench in my opinion was a really poor move from Rodgers.

As for Sterling, he needs to sharpen up. I know he's only 20 and I'm aware that he's far from the total package today, but I think I counted 4 misplaced passes in the first 10 minutes from him today. His decision making was not only taking too long, but more often than not was poor today. He needs to get his shot or cross off a little bit earlier rather than letting the defence get set and ready to read the play. Suarez was so hard to stop because he didn't need or take time to think, he just did. Early shots, early turns, early passes, before defenders could even adapt their position or have a plan in mind. When Sterling gets into the 18 yard box, every time he's taking a second or two to think about whether he's taking a shot, laying it off, attempting a take-on or recycling the play and it's a second or two too long especially when you're up against a lower league team, willing to put all hands on deck and shut up shop.

It's mostly because the American version of English is so watered down that they can't make connections when they learn languages like German, Swedish,French, etc. The way we form sentences is different from America but similar to other languages, which is why your average Brit could speak Spanish better than the average non-Latin-American.

Also, this is just dumbing down the children. It's killing the language and taking away from them what makes them different. Imagine if the French decided to just scrap the Standard French spelling in favour of Haitian Creole or African French just because they spell it exactly as it sounds. It'll start looking as if you're texting.

It's not only about the language itself.. Subject such as science, maths and even literature use Latin based words which explains the English versions' roots  thus making things like remembering definitions easier. My mate's kid started struggling just because the teacher wouldn't accept the world spelling of a word. We might as well scrap the Parliament and the measurement system and Americanise everything.

From fans, I get it - if Rodgers keeps on telling people he's lazy, people will think he's lazy.

null,false,HawkUK,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,null,"&gt;Britain’s sovereign credit rating would be better protected under a Labour government than the Tories, a leading ratings agency has signalled.
**Standard &amp; Poor’s said the biggest threat to the UK’s rating was not the state of the public finances but the risk of leaving the European Union**. Labour has pledged to remain in Europe, but the Tories are promising a referendum in 2017 if they win the election.

&gt;Asked whether Labour’s spending plans, which allow up to £28 billion more borrowing a year than the Tories, would jeopardise the UK rating, Moritz Kraemer, chief sovereign ratings officer at Standard &amp; Poor’s, told The Times: “Whether it’s faster or slower, we have no strong opinion – so long as the general direction of travel is sustainable.”
He added: “In the UK, we are more concerned about the European Union referendum.”

&gt;Both Labour and the Conservatives have pledged to cut the budget deficit over the next Parliament, but Labour is planning to allow as much as £28 billion more borrowing every year from 2016. The Tories have claimed the extra borrowing demonstrates that Labour is not fiscally disciplined.

&gt;S&amp;P is the only major ratings agency not to have stripped the UK of its gold-plated AAA rating, and Labour’s soft deficit reduction policy is unlikely to change its position.
In June, when S&amp;P took the AAA credit rating off “negative watch” and placed it back on “stable”, it warned of just two major risks. The first was “if we believed net general government debt was going to reach 100 per cent of GDP”.

&gt;The second was “a material weakening of the governance and institutional environment, and policy implementation capacity, for example as a reaction to polarizing political conflict over the UK’s role in Europe”.
Labour’s plans are not expected to push the national debt anywhere near 100 per cent of GDP.

&gt;S&amp;P expects the national debt to peak at 85 per cent in 2015. Labour has pledged to match the government’s day-to-day spending plans that year and has committed to getting debt falling as a share of GDP “as soon as possible” in the next Parliament, depending on the state of the economy.

&gt;The second risk is more of a threat if the Conservatives win the election, Mr Kraemer indicated, as it is the only party committed to a referendum on remaining in the EU.
In June, S&amp;P said: “The sovereign credit rating on the UK is based on our assumption of continued EU membership. We believe that if the UK were to leave the EU — for example following a referendum the Conservative Party has promised — this would weaken the UK’s economic prospects, and be a negative factor for the rating.”

&gt;Mr Kraemer added yesterday: “Being a member of the EU bestows the UK with multiple benefits. It is a very attractive place for investors, and not just in the financial sphere.

&gt;“If it splits with the EU, it’s not clear what benefits will remain. You cannot be sure what the relationship would look like. The remaining members would want to make sure [agreeing bi-lateral deals] was a tough process. They would not want to send any message that would encourage other members to contemplate leaving the EU.”

I use it in console mode a lot, plugged into the TV and have already cracked into the cloud-based games nvidia offer on their service called GRID.

I'm having a great time with it and once I've got streaming up and running with it, I'm sure I'll like cracking into my Steam library on the sofa too.

I don't know anything about the N1, so I can't really comment in terms of comparison, but I feel like nvidia have done a good job at making a ""gamers"" tablet.

I received the nvidia controller with it too, apparently it came free with the tablet itself. It's a good little controller, the volume buttons on it are quite flaky though.

So I'm afraid I can't really say how it stacks against other tablets. I'm told the build quality is questionable, but I've found it to be really nice myself and obviously I didn't have to spend the money on it directly, so can't say whether it is good value. I plan to get a bluetooth keyboard and mouse for it, so I can extend the amount of PC games I can stream with it, not just ones that will work well with a controller. We also have quite an android based house too, with kit like chromecasts in each TV. So the tablet has worked nicely as a media hub of sorts.

Thats not the same as running the channels. Running in channels involves peeling off the defender to either pick the ball up in the channels to run at the defender, or let the midfielders get forward and create space in the middle. Both of which he's either abnormally shit at (for a professional striker), or he's lazy. 

&gt; Slow on the Rotation that's because he's Balotelli he's not Suarez

Fucking hell, Borini's miles better on the rotation then Balo is, and Borini's still pretty shit. I don't want him to be Suarez, nor does he have to be. For a striker its easy as hell to press, and more about work rate then quality as a striker is very rarely trying to win the ball back, instead their just trying to make the defender accelerate their ball movement. Balo's inability to do so says lots about his work ethic. Lambert's not good enough on the rotation because he's 33 and slow. Balotelli's 23 and quick. Theres no excuses. 

And he may be better dropping deep, but thats not where Rodgers wants him, thats not where he should be in our system, and he slows down our transition offense by being there. Not to mention, if he's the world class striker thats been advertised, then you'd expect him to atleast be somewhat decent at leading the line - especially considering he has all the physical tools necessary to do so.

null,false,MarioMagnifico,null,null,null,"That's a nice analogy but it ignores the crux of my point. I'm saying that how the manager operates in the media is a small aspect of many that comprise man management and so you just don't have the information available to make a statement as bold as OP did. I brought up the points about this *specific* incident (or those very similar) in order to address the doubt that comes with assessing a manager's true thoughts, opinions and intentions, and their effect, from what he says to journalists. There is so much going on that you don't know about, and so much evidence that he actually is a good man manager in the results he has achieved with certain players, that it is ridiculous to make a leap to these conclusions. 

I'm not going to sit here and say Brendan has been perfect in this department, but I will say that there is enough uncertainty and evidence to the contrary to suggest that he isn't a poor man manager. In my opinion, he is a very good man manager with the players that really need to be managed properly and ultimately the players that are good enough or suited to the side. Like you say, he's the coach of LFC and so ultimately if he doesn't rate a player then it doesn't really matter what he says about them in the media (for the most part) became they don't figure into his plans regardless. Another point is that Brendan is likely speaking, in this case and others, with an eye to politics and his own self interest.

Don't over cleanse your face, it does not need washing three times a day and that can damage the barrier function (keeps water in, bacteria and irritants out). Skin is not supposed to feel tight, that suggests it is overcleansed, stripped and dehydrated. Overcleansing can cause the skin to pump out more sebum in a desperate attempt to protect itself from the onslaught.

Baby wipes are formulated for removing poop and bacteria from baby's backsides not greasy make up and sunscreen from delicate facial skin. Switch to a well formulated gentle make up remover/ cleansing oil.

Use a moisturising sunscreen if not a proper moisturiser. Acne is not as simple as sebum or oily products clogging pores, some very lightweight ingredients are clogging, some heavy ones are actually beneficial. For sunscreen choose one based on zinc oxide which is antimicrobial.

Niacinamide is one of the best actives for acne, hyperpigmentation and for moderating sebum production, but it won't be effective if you use harsh cleansers or exfoliants trying to 'tighten' pores. Green tea extract and sodium ascorbyl phosphate are also useful in acne treatment and prevention.

Fear ... stress is horrendous for skin and for general health. Research suggests targeted diet modification and physical activity (at least 10,000 steps each day) can be very helpful. Fortunately many of the same foods that are mood/ stress friendly are also skin friendly.

Ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle. If you do that look to go more anti inflammatory, lower glycaemic index - at this time of year consider your intake of vitamin D (oily fish).

Do check out our ingredients Wiki and the mega review threads linked to in the sidebar (the one on retinoids can be found via the search function).

The problem that people have in this thread is he's basically an endangered/protected species - any criticism is quickly shot down with a million downvotes and people defend him to the death. 

He can't play in the single striker role in the system that LFC plays, and that's that. We deploy a full press, starting from usually the moment the ball reaches the Left or Right back, other teams will do half press and start at half way or something. If we have one player who jogs around like a fucking Sunday walk it ruins the entire thing. 

I have nothing against Balotelli personally, and no reason to hate him, but is he right for Liverpool? He shows zero care on the pitch, zero effort toward the overall team plan and that's enough for me to say no thanks but good luck.

To my mind, it's not demeaning for a paper to print pictures of women with their tits out. It's what the Sun is known for: no-one is buying the Sun and ending up shocked at its content. It's like complaining that the Angling Times only publishes pictures of really nice carp. That's the point of it, and equating its editorial obligations to those of a 'real' newspaper - just because it's printed on the same medium - is a nonsense.

What *is* demeaning is that there are comparatively few other outlets in society where women can be defined by their other qualities. You know what the solution to this is? Creating such outlets.

Let's say in a sensible army of c80,000 there would be something like 100 colonels - 80  for front line regiments and 20 for other operations (medical, intelligence, logistics etc).

Plus ten generals for division strength upwards (10,000 men) and twenty brigadiers (assuming not every general is going to be heading a division I've left two generals and four brigadiers spare because other ops and also probably a lot of ceremonial stuff to do.

If every of the 500 colonels draws pay regularly that's £41 million in pay (around £80,000 a colonel). Plus 200 generals/brigadiers is £20 million (around £100,000 per general/brigadier, i'm averaging of course). That's a total of £61 million! 

Reducing that down to sensible numbers like those I suggested would mean reducing the expenditure on colonels from £41 million to £8 million, and the expenditure on generals from  £20 million to £8 million. That's a new total of £16 million, much more reasonable.

While I would agree with that initial premise, I don't really think it is the same as being transgender. If a person has changed gender, then aren't they classified as that gender, in the same way that some qualifies as being disabled once they have lost an actual limb. 

I understand there is ambiguity with a person who identifies as another gender, but hasn't undergone any operations or treatments to actually change gender. Truth be told, I'm not really sure how to deal with that, and I don't know anyone in that situation to discuss it with.

I do agree that the cis qualifier is unnecessary though. Disabled people don't ask ""normal"" non-disabled people to use new qualifiers as  a result of their disabilities.

Sure, his passes don't connect all the time and it's not like he's banging home goals constantly, but when he's out there, the match seems to open up. It's in especially marked contrast to Dembele, who goes out there and is so slow, deliberate, ponderous, and cautious that the game grinds to a halt. 

Mason's never going to be a world-beater, but he's an essential ingredient to our success at the moment. In an ideal situation, he'd be our second option behind someone who does what he does but better.

&gt; PA600 The Green Party believes that the hereditary principle should have no place in government. Therefore the Green Party advocates that:

&gt; 1. No person shall acquire the right to any office of government by inheritance.
&gt; 2. An hereditary peerage shall confer no right to sit in Parliament (see PA455).
&gt; 3. The monarchy shall cease to be an office of government. The legislative, executive and judicial roles of the monarch shall cease.
Peers and members of the royal family shall have the same civil rights and fiscal obligations as other citizens.
&gt; 4. A settlement of property held by the current royal family shall be made, to divide it between that required for the private life of current members of the family and that to be public property.

&gt; PA601 There shall be a complete separation of church and state. Society shall not interfere with the individual's freedom of belief, but it may by law regulate conduct arising out of that belief. In a multicultural society, a privileged position for the Church of England is inappropriate.

&gt; PA602 The Church of England shall be disestablished. It shall become self-governing, and the government shall cease to have any powers and responsibilities peculiar to that church.

Plus there's the fact that winning the domestic cup bring absolutely no money in and wins us zero international prestige.

null,false,dannyEFF,null,null,null,"I am working on this issue (I wrote the EFF action on it; I co-founded ORG). Here's my thoughts:

1. Yes, this isn't a government-proposed set of amendments. In theory that means the government will oppose them, but sometimes that is far more in theory than in practice. This set of amendments is a slighty tidied-up version of the original government proposal, and I think one reasonable thought is that whoever is trying to tidy up the Comms Data Bill to try and make sure it has a better chance next time it is presented to Parliament had some hand in this.

2. Conjecture here: best guess is that this is a trial balloon. In the period after a terrorist attack, you have a lot more leeway to push proposals like this through parliament (examples: US PATRIOT in US, DRIP in UK). How much leeway is unknown. Proposing this now might have shown that the atmosphere in Parliament is in favor of Comms Data Bill whereas previously it was not.

3. This is true, but in order to vote against it, they need to know it is being rammed past them. Hence the action. You *can* get away with this kind of thing if nobody notices (or cares).

4. If it gets to the ping pong stage, we've already lost, because if it got that far, it means that the Labour and Conservative whips have essentially allowed it to pass through the Lords.

I think Yaverland's analysis is essentially correct, except for the fact that this is surveillance legislation, promoted by strong groups within the government, in the crazy liminal period just after a terrorist attack and within weeks of a major election. 

Things can get very strange in that environment: people try to ram through otherwise controversial legislation, and politicians and parties who would otherwise complain over process quietly walk back from any commitment that might make them look weak or could be exploited.

We're led to believe that women are so frequently objectified in a sexist and misogynistic way by men, but talking as a gay man, I know this to be absolutely ridiculous. If any of these feminists had the experience of being a man getting hit on by another man, they would know that this is actually not in any way a gender or sexism issue.

In fact, I'd say a lot of the flirting that happens in the gay community is far, *far* more degrading than the things that we see critiqued by the feminist narrative. It has nothing to do with sexism or misogyny. Men are just men.

Men have sex drives. Some women are more than happy making a living from helping to fulfil them, and that's ok.

You decried him as bloodthirsty when he started no war, you decried him as racist at a time when being British meant pretty much being incredibly racist, and you decry him as stubborn as if Britishness has ever been anything but. So before you backpedal and talk about not caring if someone admires him, maybe you should look at the situation around his actions.

You talk, specifically, about him, quote ""starve millions because he was bigoted"" and in that I assume you're referring to the India famine of 1943. Which, honestly, is pretty tricksy of you. Firstly because Greek people are about as white as Indian people are, and secondly because Churchill could barely ensure his own people were fed through no fault of his own, and he was still intent on handing food out where it was needed. Considering that British India, like Britain, was already at war and the events surrounding the famile are one part awful luck to one part mother nature deciding to shit on the people of India, honestly the idea doesn't surprise me. 

&gt;when did I ever make out that I expected a flawless hero?

When you decided that Churchill's personal opinions overshadowed his actions as a soldier of the British Army, a leading politician and eventually the personification of British refusal to surrender. 

Not to mention, if you studied the history of Churchill then you'll also know that it was Churchill's continued and secretive meetings with Stalin that pretty much drove Hitler to invade Russia out of fear of Russia turning on him. Do you really think the Allies could have withstood the combined might of the Axis had Russia not soaked up so much punishment and came out with a bloody, hole-ridden grin?

Further to that, look up the Ministry for Ungentlemanly Warfare sometime. Yes it exists, or used to exist...actually I hope it still exists.

The simple fact is this, if Churchill is to be judged then I feel his actions outweigh his opinions. Churchill's personal opinion of Indians wouldn't have changed the fact that a famine happened, and considering that the Japanese invasion of Burma made more domestic transportation of food problematic at best, I don't see how you could expect foreign transportation of food to be accomplished with any great ease.

Don't you know a war was on, to adjust the old saying.

&gt;and why does Jesus have to come into this?

Because Jesus said bad things too, Rognvaldr, but nobody holds those bad things against him because he's generally agreed to have been an alright bloke with some decent ideas about how we should treat one another.

I don't disagree with you there. Were it not for fucking simplified English my dissertation could have been done the night before instead of over three days.

&gt;Most books won't be written in simplified English. A song of ice and fire comes to mind. Harry Potter was an easy read but ASOIAF is like the unabridged version. Reading the Shakespeare books and use of World/British English helped me be able to read such a book without wondering what certain words meant despite the book being written by an American.

I've resisted the GOT series in both print and tv because of an ex so I'm somewhat of a heathen. What exactly do you mean by that, has Martin gone full Tolkein?

I sort of get the sentiment somehow though. Harry Potter was piss easy to read. LOTR, far less so. As much as I loved and re-read the Hobbit, LOTR was boring and hard as fuck to read between the ages of 11 and 15.

&gt;I've resisted the GOT series in both print and tv because of an ex so I'm somewhat of a heathen. What exactly do you mean by that, has Martin gone full Tolkein?

I won't say he's gone full Tolkien but you'd think it's written by an Englishman if it weren't for the lack of Us and extra Ls (got the American version as a gift set). It's very good and well written. He uses old English a lot so for those who are used to simplified English, you'd have to read it about 3 or 4 times until it clicks. It's really immersive, so if you're an average reader, you'd have to read it a second time just to pick up on the little things you might've missed but it's not boring. It's like reading a new story because you've acquired new knowledge. I do sympathise but don't let your ex ruin a good book and TV SHOWS show.

I can honestly not see any stress or responsibility in her life. She cuts a ribbon at a hospital, with evident ill grace and grumpiness. She asks people what they do. She waves. She goes to the races. She plays with corgis. She goes on expensive foreign trips. She sits in a big house in the middle of London, surrounded by servants and toadies.

Free trade as in tariff free trade as performed between the UK and the EU. Yes there is regulation in all markets but a tariff essentially takes away what is often a slim profit margin for small businesses and then effectively restricts the flow of goods and services.

Full reserve banking would result in capital flight from the UK and the banking sector's mortgage rates going up significantly. In addition banks would probably issue very few loans until they reach a full reserve.

A zero or negative growth economy would mean we'd either stay at the same level of wealth or our wealth would decrease year after year. This would mean that the poor would get poorer each year, not as a consequence of capitalism but as mandated policy from the government.

Inheritance tax made to gifts is just another way of taking the hard won proceeds of work away from those who deserve and it giving it to the state which often does not deserve to take other's wealth.

Won't name where. New instructor, and was being observed by some official. He was persistently being corrected by official in car park section. On things like how to use the centre stand, braking with the emergency stop, Oh and was very argumentative about positioning. E.g. I originally learnt each lane split into five (avoiding centre due to oil and crap collected), now they teach three and to stay in the middle. 

On the road, after repeatedly losing us, radio cutting out, and being accused of things that didnt happen. He did apologise when the observer corrected him. 

It took 12 hours, and the observer ended up shouting at the instructor in a side office for half hour'ish. But finally given certificate and away I went.

Done with CBT in Telford/Shrewsbury. Five lessons (three different instructors) and they booked my mod1 and mod2 for the same day. That's the only issue I had worth the place. Yes I was an idiot my first lesson with them1. , I got dropped, due to a busy island, and fairly aggressively filtered to catch up. But after being suitably chastised it wasn't an issue. 
Lively guys, bikes were generally pretty good condition, only had one dodgy bike (iffy front tyre, so turning left leant over so far then, felt like there was a sudden drop/change in lean, scared the crap out of me). 

Test.
Taken in Shrewsbury. Examiner was a nice enough guy. Mod1 had zero faults. I was told a nice bit of info that the min speed was at 4k revs in second (if I remember correctly), once you learnt the engine sound at that speed it was east enough to get there. 
Mod2 I nearly failed twice. The first time was for overtaking a lorry at 70, on a dual carriageway, with a temporary 50mph speed limit. I got a little confused when the temporary speed restriction ended. The other was worse in that didn't move over for an oncoming lorry across a fairly narrow bridge.

Firstly. Thirty two? You're not even at the 'good' age yet! You are, however, getting closer. 35 is where it's at. Oscar Wilde said so, so it must be true. You have three years and one day until you finally reach a good age. Don't despair! Things can't sort themselves out for you on their own. You need to make them, and how can you do that while you're still so young?

You have an obligation to them to not kill yourself with alcohol. If for noone else, do it for me, please, just take it easy. I promise you, alcohol abuse is not a nice way to see a loved one die. Rum in small quantities is rather pleasant. Three bottles of it is poison.

Hundreds of people have said it in the match threads that go in here, Henderson yelled at him, Lucas yelled at him, it's a given. I don't need Brendan Rodgers to come out and tell me that someone can't press, I can see it myself.

As I said, I can only go with my own eyes and I haven't seen laziness. As /u/nnth correctly (in my view) said, his decision-making might be an issue but I don't think it is a work rate problem. Particularly early on, I have focused on him practically all match, just to see what kind of player he is and how he behaves off the ball and he was by no means the prima donna people make him out to be. 

I know he has a certain history, but I just haven't seen that at LFC. Maybe I'm blind or maybe I have different expectations, but I still maintain his problems are down to him being used in the wrong way and his decision-making, *not* work rate. 

&gt; The problem that people have in this thread is he's basically an endangered/protected species - any criticism is quickly shot down with a million downvotes and people defend him to the death.

Okay, could we stop this 'Aww, I always get downvotes for criticising Balotelli' or 'Aww, I always get downvotes for praising Balotelli' nonsense? The trend on this sub is as it always have been: if you make an interesting point and back it up with solid arguments, you will get upvotes. Your comment currently has more upvotes than mine, so let's stop playing the martyr card when it comes to Balotelli, all right? At any rate, it sort of 'meta-chat' only distracts from the football conversation. 

&gt; He can't play in the single striker role in the system that LFC plays, and that's that.

I fully agree with this. I still maintain he *can* play in the LFC system (see Spurs) but not in the single striker role he's been playing since Sturridge's injury. 

&gt; If we have one player who jogs around like a fucking Sunday walk it ruins the entire thing. 

Again, I haven't seen this. 

&gt; He shows zero care on the pitch, zero effort toward the overall team plan and that's enough for me to say no thanks but good luck.

And this is just plain wrong. Watch the QPR match. If that's zero effort in your eyes than our entire team is just a bunch of slackers.

null,false,buried_treasure,null,null,null,"Competition for entry-level web development jobs is extremely fierce. To be honest most employers will be less concerned with whether or not you've got relevant academic qualifications, and more concerned with your skills and experience.

So what you really need is a portfolio. Put together some sites -- preferably real ones, not mock-ups. Find some small local charities or community groups that need a web presence and offer to create them a site for free. Yes it'll cost you -- a lot of time, and a modest amount of cash for hosting. But the payoff comes when you're in a job interview and almost any employer is going to prefer the politics graduate who's already built a couple of decent websites over the computer science graduate who spent two terms studying compiler theory.

And don't forget the ""soft skills"". Although it's near impossible when you're a one-man team to follow current industry best-practice concepts such as agile working, code reviews, and so on, being able to demonstrate a good knowledge and understanding of that side of the industry will put you head and shoulders above 90% of new entrants to the field.

My final advice: stick with the politics degree. It's not a bad degree to have and without any kind of degree you'll find the world of employment much harder to get into. If as you say you're enjoying the course then you ought to be able to come out of Uni with, say, a 2.1, without it being a total chore. And in your spare time concentrate entirely on the web development stuff that interests you. And build that portfolio of real-world working sites!

And we should've been shown before the Tottenham/Leicester games (based on the deciding factors above) as we beat Southampton, a team unbeaten in 8 games and third in the league, compared to Leicester beating Tottenham, who aren't having a particularly impressive run at the moment. The Palace game also had two extra goals.

&gt; How are they getting doctors to work on slave wages then?

By ""slave wages"" you mean wages that are reasonable when they don't have to chase the ridiculous inflation rates of consumerist societies, and they do so because Cubans don't seem to value always trying but never succeeding to attain something meaningful by purchasing it. Lets be clear here: your contention from the very first moment has been that Cuba is wasting money by saving African lives. I don't think any doctor would agree with you. 

Since then you've slid from something about Venezuelan politics to stating that Cuba should be spending *even more*. All of this weaseling around, because Cuba thought working for the benefit of the lesser off (and all of us, really) is worthwhile.

But yes - that's a set-up I would very much like to see but I don't think we will at this point. The new 3-4-2-1 system seems to be working very well, so I'm not sure Rodgers will be willing to jeopardise that by changing the formation again. Nor do I think he should do.

If we're going two up front where one forward is Sturridge, I'd rather see Balotelli come on as a sub than Lambert or Borini.

My career's fine now but I still regret not having made the push to find internships, even if it meant living away summers and racking up a touch more debt. Just to get that leg-up in my early jobs. Later on, having seem a few interns come through my workplace, I think they definitely get valuable experience. And those that did well, the companies concerned were generally keen to recruit after they graduated.

Now internships don't seem to be the be-all and end-all in the UK in most industries, but finance is its own world, fairly high-prestige and lots of money, with a reputation for intellectual and class snobbery. My suspicion is that if you don't have the right contacts or that Oxbridge degree, an internship is a good way to start getting those contacts and make yourself stand out.

All those immigration statistics you see about immigrants benefiting the country? Those are averages, the middle classes and the upper class benefit from migration, it boosts their income but hurts those in the bottom 10%. For every hundred migrants, the working class loses 27 jobs.

Plenty of people switch disciplines after the first year and Universities seem ready to accommodate it. The only issue is depending on where you're looking to find yourself employed it might be tough to find a job. It seems like it's quite a competitive market at the moment; Of the people on my course, the only ones who walked into a job were those who had not only come top of the class but put the extra effort in, built up their portfolio and beefed up in skills.

No matter what, a BSc from a university won't adequately prepare you for a career in modern web development, so you're going to have to put the work in yourself!

What employers are looking for at the moment is definitely not qualifications, rather they're looking for people with demonstrable skill in their field. If you truly have a passion for webdev, I'd recommend a course in at least the same discipline, and to start some of your own projects in the meantime.

For instance, Spycatcher revealed that MI5 did know in the 1950s that the Soviet Union was sending actual cash to the UK Communist Party, but rather than show the proof which they had, to discredit the party (it would have been very effective circa 1956 or 1968) they'd rather surreptitiously brief right-wing journos to keep them happy, while not destroying the party proper. Gotta have an official enemy, after all, and a few journalists grateful for insider titbits is also a handy thing to have.

So the Brittan story might well have been true, and it might be the same accusations as the current ones. MI5 sits on the stories because they have politicians they can blackmail, and when they saw how the press was covering the Brittan/Heseltine spat, they decided to leak enough of it to bring down Brittan a bit for whatever reasons, without losing him as a blackmailable asset. Or maybe an MI5 insider decided that he wanted to bring down Brittan entirely because of what he knew, but couldn't get the press to bite, because the allegations were extreme enough that no journalist would touch them with a bargepole, at least not without some rock solid proof.

One top 4 finish doesn't help us keep players, it doesn't bring better players, finishing in the top 4 a few years in a row might do those things but being in the champions league for 6 months before falling back into the europa isn't anything special. Liverpool got top 4 and thought they would get a better quality of player, did they? No they ended up with more of the same. Arsenal who consistently get champions league managed to get one of the best players in the league. 


You said that you would willingly trade winning any trophy in order to get **TWO** top 4 finishes, why?. It gives you more money yeah fair enough but what difference does more money make when you can't get the better players? More prestigious? We still won't be as prestigious as the other clubs who consistently get top 4. It may change with the new stadium but until then scraping the odd top 4 spot is fruitless. 


TL;DR-The much greater shot at glory isn't real. Finishing there twice won't make us title challengers because we still wouldn't be able to get the quality of players necessary, finishing there 5 or 6 times might but we can't do that yet, so why would you swap actually winning a trophy (the entire point of football...) for two top 4 finishes?",null,0,null,1422185945,null,0,false,0,co06cb6,null,t3_2tiwhy,null,t1_co06cb6,null,t1_cnzu50q,null,null,null,1424402215,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

It's worth clarifying that the healthcare itself will be no better in private practice than in NHS. In many cases the same consultants who do private work are also employed in NHS hospitals. It also works the other way round -- many routine, minor operations on the NHS are ""outsourced"" to private hospitals, so the staff and medical equipment will be identical.

So what private health insurance buys you in the UK is two main benefits:

* Access to specialists and consultants ""on demand"", as opposed to NHS specialist treatment which requires a GP referral and (for non life-threatening conditions) a possible long-ish wait.

Those sources are a bit clickbaity/sensational but they're right.

They're already going after Luxembourg for being dodgy about tax.

Ireland allows something called a [double Irish arrangement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement). 
 
My view is that some places in the world allow massive amounts of tax to be avoided in other countries if they get a small amount in return.

In other words Ireland and Luxembourg are happy to get pennies while the corporations avoid pounds.

It's worth pointing out that the UK crown dependencies also have loopholes and are tax havens, [flags of convenience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_convenience) etc and that we have our own tax dodge agreement where where charge non-domiciled people a flat amount of tax.

You could consider trying the Paula's Choice BHA for body instead of the one for face. I think Wayne Goss does this, and with the 20% off the UK site has this month it's not so bad price-wise. My understanding is the face liquid is stronger (not in bha percentage terms, obv,) and more moisturising than the face gel. The body BHA is at a ph that means it is 'stronger', so it might not work but could be worth a try.

I wonder if it might be worth holding off the retinol for a while, as some people react to it and you're not in your thirties yet, especially as you're planning to introduce a lot of new products. My understanding is if you use retinol, you need to use sunblock everyday, and I think PC advise this too if you're using BHA.

If you haven't already done so, you could email PC and they'll recommend products for you, so you'll know if they think eg the hydralight or skin recovery is best. They're happy to answer questions.

If you want to wear spf and want to avoid white cast you can use spf with synthetic (aka chemical) spf (you prob know this, sorry). I break out with these and they irritate my eyes but they work for lots of people. I'm using a mineral one that will unfortunately be too oily for you I think ( http://www.albabotanica.com/sun/mineral-sun-protection/fragrance-free-mineral-broad-spectrum-spf-30.html). Some people mix a TINY bit of foundation or tinted moisturiser in with sunblock to avoid a white cast, but you have to be careful not to add too much or you'll detract from the spf.

I wouldn't bother with eyecream.

I've skimmed comments below and seen there's discussion of sulphates. For what it's worth, I've read that many sulphates are fine for skin (eg that's what PC say - no idea if they're right, though), eg sodium laureth sulphate, and I use them myself. I may be wrong and apologies if my skim reading meant I misread other people's posts.

However, this seems not to be the case with mass surveillance, and data retention laws. Probably because that law was originally a European law pimped by the UK (the European Court of Human Rights struck down that particular legislation). This is why we have been seeing a rush of emergency legislation on snooping and data retention recently, which no doubt will eventually be heard at the UK Supreme Court.

However, the government have put a date of expiry on these new laws, probably as a means to re-introduce the same laws under different names to thwart legal challenges, or any potential future ruling by the UK Supreme Court.

A sort of, 'Oh we don't need to look at that particular law, judge - it has already expired.'

null,false,Growlbot_,lfc87,,null,"When there was so much criticism over the defence a few weeks ago, I don't think anyone expected Rodgers to go to a back three and it be successful. He deserves a lot of credit for that. It was at a time, that if things had got worse, it could have put Rodgers in an awkward position going forward. It actually unlocked the door to us overloading the midfield and being able to find positions for our overabundance of playmakers.

It could also have been a placebo to some extent because suddenly our back line looks much more comfortable and confident. Three central defenders are better than two for the feeling of security and pushing the wingbacks further up the pitch allows us to turn defence into attack easier and make communication between the central defenders simpler. Sakho still worries me when he is pressured because I think he takes too many risks trying to play when he should take an easier option to clear. I think we also still struggle to manage a physical team who want to match us like Wimbledon.

Mignolet is benefitting from the tactical change. My opinion is that he is a better keeper than people here give him credit for. His confidence is an issue but when has he had a settled and useful defence to play behind? I think Rodgers partly removed him in order to take him out of the spotlight and playing Jones was a message to get Mignolet switched on again. We certainly need more competition in that area, Cech would be a steal if we could get him, though I still think Mignolet isn't done here like a lot of others do.",null,0,null,1422187002,null,0,1422187360,0,co06jbw,null,t3_2tltdd,null,t1_co06jbw,null,t3_2tltdd,null,null,null,1424402124,null,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7,null

The only problem with him is that his age means his body can only do so much. Lambert understands how to press. Sturridge understands how to press. Suarez was one of the best pressers of the ball that I've ever seen. Balotelli simply doesn't know how to press.

I think people here are getting a little confused in what pressing actually does. Pressing isn't to make tackles or interceptions, it's to close down a player and force him to pass to somewhere when there isn't any other option. Positioning yourself between the CB on the right side means you have to pass to the left or risk an interception. It's more to do with making play predictable more than anything.

What is encouraging for me is :

- Migs has come out and claimed more crosses..  Every other game I hear his 'keeper'  calls and he has come out and claimed and punched lot more. 

- the communication seems to have improved. 

- positioning has also improved for him.  As an example.. Remember the  Costa chance?  Fabrigas let the ball run and Costa was in but Migs was in much better position and could clear the ball away from the edge of penalty area. The migs of old would have stayed in goal and it would have been 1 v 1. 


So overall its a lot of improvement from him..  Having said that..  He is still not as good at distribution as you would want a keeper to be..  He  is not exposed in this department because again Lucas provides a easy pass to him as DM.

In all honesty the sub is generally left/centrist leaning, but thats pretty much because the vast majority of our members are effectively exiled from ukpolitics as the vocal frothy UKIP contingent make it extremely difficult to attempt to contribute in good faith. In short, like saviouroftheweek found, its simply not worth the effort to post there.

We do not intentionally filter out right wing supporters, we simply dont tolerate any prejudicial posting which rather filters out most of the current UKpolitics crowd. People from all parts of the political spectrum are welcome so long as they can avoid dipping into particularly racially motivated arguments. Personally, I think it rather speaks volumes about the current crop of UKIP supporters that only a couple of them can manage to post without going into those dark areas - and one of those guys on /r/britishpolitics is wavering towards labour.

The only failure to engage has been from the Muslim community to the British public. The British aren't locking them in ghettos and keeping them away from integration, they are *choosing* to segregate themselves from society. It's a bit rich to blame the government for any failures there.

It is not on the British people or the government to pander to Muslims needs. All religions are equal, this ideal held up by law. Any anti-islamic sentiment that breaches the law will be dealt with appropriately as much of it has been. A running theme of demanding special concessions for a specific religion. 

There are many moderate Muslims who have integrated without issue. The people she talks of so very away from society and the apparent victims of Islamophobia are generally speaking the ones who are most extreme. No one bats an eye if you're Muslim and look fairly normal. If you see a man on the street of middle eastern appearance wearing a suit, you would think nothing of it  if he was a Muslim.

British society's issues  with Muslims are minor. Many of us see women clad in burkas in the street. We walk on by, never judging. I am anti-migration and still respect people's religious beliefs. This idea of a rising tide of Islamophobia is absurd. It is not the Muslim people that people in Britain take issue with, it's ISIS and the attacks by it and its supporters in Europe. It's important to note that any roots in anti-muslim sentiment are from the bloodletting of innocents. Based out of fear of murder, not off xenophobia.

**Greens contemplate life beyond the fringe**


Janan Ganesh


*The party’s hippie gap year cannot last for ever*

They detect an upside to economic growth of zero. They see scant need for armed forces. They would decriminalise membership of al-Qaeda. If you attended a hundred bohemian dinner parties, scribbled down every cockamamie idea you overheard and collated them into an anthology, it would not be a million miles from the Green party’s policy programme. There is no more eccentric group with parliamentary representation in Britain.


And eccentricity is the generous interpretation. Parties of the right that romanticise life before modernity, and voice reservations about population growth that verge on the Malthusian, arouse our suspicion. With their left-liberal pedigree, the Greens get away with a reputation as well-meaning but vapid: hippies on a gap year that never ends.


Yet how they flourish. Roughly a tenth of the electorate tell pollsters they will vote Green at the general election in May, which would constitute a tenfold improvement on the party’s last score. At 45,000, it now has more members than the Liberal Democrats, a party of government, and the UK Independence party, which, until recently, faced no competition as the most successful outsider in politics.


If anything, its political feats are more impressive than Ukip’s. It does well in urban and rural areas alike. Its MP, Caroline Lucas, was returned at a general election, not the special circumstances of a by-election. It runs a local council, in Brighton. And it has done all this without a superstar leader like Nigel Farage. It makes do with Natalie Bennett, an Australian-born former journalist whose profile is much lower and whose gifts do not include that of the gab. Its only advantage over Ukip is experience: the Greens did well a generation ago, scoring two million votes in the European Parliament elections of 1989, before Ukip was even founded.


Like Ukip, the party grows via publicity, however adverse. Its recent failure to be classified a “major” party by Ofcom, the media regulator, could have been humiliating. Instead, it drew sympathy and thousands of new followers. Like Ukip, its appeal lies not in what it is but what it is not. It is not of the political establishment, and that is enough for the most ornery voters in an anti-politics country.


And just as Ukip lures rightwingers from the Conservatives, the Green party is like acid working away at the Labour base. Its indirect effect on the election could be decisive, as could its sway over the future of the British left. Strategically, the worst result for Labour in May would be a loss coupled with a large Green vote. This would allow the Labour left to blame defeat on inadequate ideological purity. “Re-uniting the progressive family”, or some such code, would be used to justify core-vote politics under a strident new leader. As if Labour had been doing anything else under Ed Miliband .


If the left is splitting, it is not without the active collusion of the Tories. David Cameron, prime minister, mentions the Greens whenever he can and argues for their presence in any pre-election television debates. His chancellor, George Osborne, challenges Labour to say whether it goes along with some of his cuts to public spending. If the answer is no, Labour looks feckless; if it is yes, voters who hate austerity toy with voting Green. Either way, the Tories profit.


Again, the symmetry with Ukip is uncanny. Mr Cameron will spend the campaign warning Conservatives that support for Mr Farage would only help to make Mr Miliband prime minister. Mr Miliband will portray every Green vote as a backhanded gift to the Tories. Both main parties appear to have given up on taking votes directly from each other. All the churn in British politics now takes place at the fringes, where minority parties compete for the roughly one-third of the electorate who wish to register disaffection with the mainstream. Many new Greens are themselves former Lib Dems alienated by that party’s collaboration with the Tories. They are not just protest voters. They are protest voters protesting against another protest party for not protesting enough.


Nor does Labour’s Green problem ease if Mr Miliband ends up in government. The party is officially committed to fiscal austerity for the next five years, but it is not psychologically prepared. There is a risk of trauma, disillusion and fragmentation, as a tribe united by a belief in the goodness of public spending sets about reducing it. Trade unions, public sector workers, charities, campaign groups, Fabian cognoscenti — the ecosystem that adds up to the Labour movement will start to fray. The Green party needs only stand still to attract these heartbroken Labourites. An absolute breakdown of the right, over Europe and other matters, has been in train for years. The left may yet beat them to it.


There is a consoling thought for both main parties. As insurgents grow, they encounter dilemmas of their own. New members bring new thoughts, some of which conflict with party doctrine. You do not have to strain to see the gap between Douglas Carswell, the MP who joined Ukip from the Tories last year, and his more conservative colleagues. He is an optimist who sees a world growing richer and healthier through markets and technology. The average Ukipper takes a much bleaker view. The Greens will have to get used to similar fissures as they multiply in number.


Then there is the prospect of power. If the election throws up a parliament in which neither Labour nor the Tories add up to a governing majority with the Lib Dems, the fringe parties may be asked to make up the numbers. Assent, and they are immediately tainted by the contentious decisions that governments must make. Refuse, and they forgo a chance to wield national power that may never come around again.


The main parties are entitled to a smirk at this. They are unpopular because they hold or have held office. They have to make real judgments on tax, spending and foreign policy, each of which offends someone somewhere. Their tormentors in the smaller parties are rampant precisely because they do not have this burden. Nothing defeats fringe politics like the reality of power.

No. Every doctor tells themselves this. There are not limitless opportunities in the private sector. The Private sector would not increase its need for doctors because pay was going down in the public sector. It would become far more selective and competitive.

This may be the problem. It was only cheap if you can afford it.

Think of your outgoings in terms of how much of your annual salary goes on them. you earn £370/wk after tax. you pay £3900 per year on car loans.

Thats over 10 weeks pay - from new years day through to spring equinox going just on the car before you start paying for rent, food, fluids, heat, all the things without which you will die of hunger and cold.

There's a qualitative differenece to you between the man who has this car and the image and experience of driving it, and the man who turns up places in say a 2005 VW Golf TDi. Will you give up 10 weeks pay to  protect that image?

Or is the car part of the problem?

However, nuclear weapons are only useful insofar as they are a deterrent; the moment they are used in an offensive capability, they begin to undermine the position of the state which they are tasked to protect in several ways: firstly, economically. I mentioned it previously, but as all states now operate on a global scale it makes anything remotely offensive anathema to the markets. Russia would lose far more money that it has done from sanctions already, and there would be a revolt. Secondly, environmentally. If Russia seeks to exert itself on a global level through nuclear weapons it would ultimately reap the unfortunate downsides of using them, that is to say, extreme radiation poisoning for everyone (plus nuclear winter - or, at the very least, global cooling)! Lastly, politically. Russia would be forever ostracised on the world stage - providing there is a world stage to stand on - and virtually nobody would trade with them. Except, maybe, North Korea.

I know Putin is perceived as being mad, but he could not have got where he is (and done what he's done) without being intelligent and calculating - as such, he will not use nuclear weapons in an offensive capacity. This is why it's my belief that a single country doesn't need to own or operate nuclear weapons if it's part of a larger bloc which does, because the threat of annihilation is constantly there, regardless of who owns them.

Of course, my view changes entirely when we talk about the UK inside a federal Europe, but it's a natural extension of my belief that a single constituent of NATO doesn't need nuclear weapons, merely that *someone* operates them.",null,0,null,1422191264,null,0,false,0,co07dyy,null,t3_2tlpsl,null,t1_co07dyy,null,t1_co06zoy,null,null,null,1424401679,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

They can and do panic and go into limp mode for relatively minor or common issues, such as aborted regeneration - this is particularly so if the filter is heavily loaded with soot. They may also not be quite aggressive enough at regeneration as may be needed, leading to clogging even under relatively normal conditions.

Another potential problem is incorrect maintenance. Diesel produces soot when it burns, but the soot is, for practical purposes, pure carbon, so can burn without leaving any ash. Engine oil does not burn cleanly and can leave ash. If the engine burns oil, due to the wear-and-tear, inadequate maintenance, etc. then the ash from oil burning can get into the filter and clog it - and because it is ash, and won't burn, the filter is finished. DPF equipped cars require a very low ash oil, which are significantly more expensive than conventional oils and not all people, especially DIY and backstreet mechanics, are aware of the importance of this.

As it is, I expect petrol particulate filters to be required before too long. The Euro 6 phase 2 (2017) emissions regulations for petrol will place strict limits on particulates. Hopefully, these will be more reliable.

It will last 50 years. Bear in mind that 50 years ago we still had the USSR, the Berlin wall. Islamic extremism didn't exist. It was a VERY different political landscape. Who knows what will happen in the next 50. The USA will be less dominant for sure. Maybe they won't be special friends with the UK any more. Maybe the EU collapses. Maybe NATO disbands. 

That's why it's hard to rely on others for our protection. If some country (ok, let's be honest - it would be Russia) really did start a war with the UK, could we REALLY count on the US, France and others to back us up and potentially lose millions of their citizens? I don't think so.

The technology exists and can't be uninvented. While nukes are undoubtedly terrible things, we can't stop people making them. So even if we got of ours, we can't stop other countries from having them or new countries from getting them. Iran have nuclear ambitions. North Korea have already tested 2-3.

History shows that giving up your nuclear weapons is a bad idea. Ukraine gave up a stockpile, and now look what happens to them. Russia grab a piece of their land and the rest of the world does bugger all.

History shows that HAVING nuclear weapons makes you fucking powerful. Russia is a shitty country, poor, backwards and largely incapable. If a similarly powered country like Italy started a war, we would slap them back down into place before breakfast. That's because Italy have no nukes. But we are all scared to fuck with Russia because they have nukes. That's why bad countries like NK and Iran want nukes. When they have them, they HAVE to be taken seriously and we can't ignore them any more. 

I'm not even going to make arguments about jobs, economics etc because they are so small in comparison to the real issues. The only thing I'll say is the money isn't taken into a field and burned.

A short version is that /r/britishpolitics is a splinter of /r/ukpolitics set up last year because of the lack of action on the part of the ukpolitics moderators to combat a rising tide of poorly informed, prejudiced and vitriolic posting. 

Nowadays, the difference is simply night and day - you can actually discuss anything that isnt UKIP or UKIP related, or post a critical view of UKIP, on /r/britishpolitics without getting dogpiled en masse.

---

&gt;Coined in 2001 by researcher [Marc Prensky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Prensky),  the term __digital native__ is used to describe people born after 1980, when social digital technologies such as Usenet and bulletin board systems came online. Digital natives are characterized as having access to networked digital technologies and the skills to use those technologies. Major parts of their lives and daily activities are mediated by digital technologies: social interaction, friendships, civic activities, and hobbies. A digital native has never known any other way of life   [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

It absolutely makes you more secure. Criminals, especially violent and/or armed criminals, don't want to get shot so they tend not to target places where they are more likely to get shot and tend to target places they are less likely to get shot. The USA, as you cited, is ironically the perfect example of this.

&gt; I also think that by that same logic all it takes is one lunatic and you have a full-scale war on your hands. 

That's why such efforts are put into the IAEA preventing the expansion of the nuclear weapons club and things like the Iraq War happened. No one wants Iran to develop nukes, for example.

&gt; as a nation, signatories to the NNPT one of whose goals is ""to further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament""[1] . You don't further disarmament by staying armed. 

Actually, you do. Nuclear disarmament can and has occurred in stages (principally between Russia and the USA) where less secure weapons are deweaponised and either not replaced or replaced with more secure weapons. But until rogue states such as North Korea are declared nuclear weapon free the safeguards of nuclear weapons remain needed.

&gt; And then there's the cost[2] of the thing. Savings of £83bn over the next 50 years aren't to be sniffed at.

That isn't a potential saving, it's the least expensive option to secure British interests. I'd suggest looking at the costs for alternatives [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/212745/20130716_Trident_Alternatives_Study.pdf) (and although it is mentioned in the report I'll say it again here that alternatives do not provide like for like capability).",null,0,null,1422194789,null,0,false,0,co0892o,null,t3_2tlpsl,null,t1_co0892o,null,t1_co05xry,null,null,null,1424401277,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

As two people with extensive experience of the NHS are you going to tell me with a straight face all doctors are the best that society has to offer. I know a range of doctors from the excellent to the awful - like every profession. I see very little to suggest that money buys excellence. The main problems faced by the public is lack of clinical time. It doesn't matter how clever a doctor is if you're getting 5 minutes of their time. This is lop sided.

Hmm... I don't think that's true. A nuclear weapon is good for two things; massive wide-area blast damage (airburst) or precisely targeted asset destruction (ground burst or [lay-down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laydown_delivery)). The Afghanistan conflict was counter-insurgency with no targets that would benefit from anything larger than a [thermobaric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermobaric_weapon) weapon, and even then those would be a tiny handful of cave systems. The enemy in Afganistan was, and remains, intermingled with the civilian population ruling out any counter-city warfare.

Secondly to the above, there is also an unbroken taboo against the use of nuclear weapons of any sort. This is largely because if one uses them then one implicitly grants permission for them to be used against oneself.

As Optio pointed out, we started out as a splinter from /r/ukpolitics as (in our view) the moderation pollicy had led to the place gradually becoming borderline intolerable for various reasons. 

The fundamental difference between the two subreddits is the moderation policy- /r/ukpolitics is, for better or worse, run with a ""hands off"" stance. 

/r/BritishPolitics' mods take a much more active role in the community, and enforce strict conduct guidelines- they're all visible in the subreddit's sidebar, but stripped down to the essentials? Polite, cordial conduct, an absolute *actually enforced* ban on racism/homophobia, and active mod intervention in the community to maintain a healthy atmosphere. 

We're intending to keep to this state of affairs as long as practical- it's worked reasonably well so far. We vet every comment that goes into the subreddit at least twice a day, and try to take an active role in developing a genuine community around the place. It's taken six months of work, but it's finally become a genuinely distinct community of its own, with a regular userbase entirely independent of /r/ukpolitics. 

We run regular IRC events coinciding with political events- Question Time, by-elections, debates, and occasionally PMQs, all run with the same ethos as the subreddit- active mod intervention in the community to maintain its status as a pleasant, *welcoming* place to spend time. 

The heavy moderation's a conscious decision- we've no intention of sharing any characteristics with the other place beyond the subject matter. Quality contributors are encouraged, whatever their position on the spectrum- and arguments are defused before they get to the point of flame wars. 

I feel like we've created something substantially more accessible and welcoming than /r/ukpolitics, with a generally higher standard of community and debate. Given the widespread discontent with /r/ukpolitics' moderation policy, we've grown quite considerably- I do think it warrants consideration as a community in its own right, rather than just an offshoot.

Basically, it's a great place to spend time, and we'd love a bit more exposure. Appreciate you taking the time to think about it!

Its almost like someone defending their right to call black people ""n*****s"" just because you don't want to recognise them as people and then at the same time saying they are equal, whilst making every effort to make them feel unequal.

That whole ""feeling the same way"" thing is strange... No one is asking you to feel the same way as them, just to treat them as people and I can tell you now, deliberately miss-gendering a TG person makes them feel less than a person. You don't need to feel the same way as another person to be able to empathise with them.

The argument that it is PC gone mad that you hint at in your original post and that I saw others echoing just shows how uninformed on the subject you are since if you think its PC gone mad to have to recognise these people by how they want to be recognised then it clearly shows your true feelings on the issue. Which is to say you don't believe them to be equal at all.

Maybe you don't know the insane rate of suicide and violence TG people face in society, it is ""opinions"" like these that help cause that.

null,false,Five_Two_Zero,null,null,null,"&gt; I paid £200-300 a month with no parental support and a student loan of £1500~ a year. That was the most I could get even with two low-income parents. One year they gave me an extra £500 hardship loan. I never had any trouble, I just lived cheaply and ate cheaply and spent 4 years being poor. I'm not really seeing what the issue is, then?

Because it's nowhere near realistic when you're talking someone who can only work part-time at most.

That loan rate would only pay for 6 or 7 months rent tops, even if there were no additional expenses. That means you have to get work to afford the next 5-6 months rent, food, clothes, bills etc. But you are also a student and cannot work full-time. That means you are left doing work as a bartender or McDonalds employee. Know how much they pay? Minimum wage. And that's if you're lucky enough to be able to get a job.

Now lets say minimum wage was about £5 when you went to uni. To cover the remaining rent you need to have worked 40-60 hours a month during those months. That's *just* rent. Food for a month is about another 15 hours a month on top of that, and bills can turn out to be just shy of an extra £100, so that's another 20 hours a month. That works out to 75-95 hours a month for those months, or just shy of 19-24 hours a week. Not that bad so far, right?

The problem is you a) need time to go to university and b) need time to study, which will seriously eat into your time available to work. Even if you saved up money for those subsequent 5-6 months, you're still going to be working flat-out for your job while working flat-out for your degree.

Mignolet biggest weakness is crosses and passing. He is a really good shotstopper. But the way we are playing we need someone who is good in those departments.

Car - is by far the easiest, take A703 to Peebles then follow signs to Glentress.

Train - Not open yet, but the borders rail link will take you to Tweed Bank from their you could take a cycle route to Glentress but would be a 10-15mile ride i reckon. I think the line should be open later this year but i'm not totally sure?

Bus - No public busses as far as i know. But i've heard rumours of companies that organise busses down that way but i'm not totally sure!

I hope he leaves ASAP. Absolutely sick of people talking about Balotelli, I have no idea why BR just doesn't leave it at that, why is he 'honest' about Balotelli but not about any other player?

If the team plays shit, he still says they were wonderful. Balotelli isn't even playing and he gets criticized regularly. There's no sense in dragging the player through mud, sell him or shut the fuck up already.

I knew it would be tough for him here, but at a certain point you have to accept that BR just doesn't like him. People can talk about pressing all they want, but when he was playing games he was doing that! He might not have made the right run or decision, but he was actually pressing which is what he is getting criticized for here.

Grammar schools I would argue help the poor, given that intelligent poor people like myself would receive a better quality education. I actually think the opposite in that the removal of grammar schools removes a rung from the ladder that gets you out of poverty.

But you really answered yourself already:

Not helped in the slightest by the local councils, they know that any HMO licensed property in a student area is pretty much guaranteed never to pay council tax, so they make it as awkward as possible for new ones to be created. This means that despite huge demand for student property in an area, it's very difficult for supply to increase in accordance, keeping prices artificially high.

In Glasgow, for example, there is currently an 11 month period between applying for a license and one being granted, during which time it cannot legally be let to students. Unless you can afford to have a property sitting empty for a year, if not more, it's impossible to create new HMOs. All this does is a) all but stop the creation of new HMOs, keeping rent artificially high for students and b) ensure that any HMOs which *are* created go to the exceptionally wealthy who can afford to pay 11+ months of mortgage repayments with no income.",null,0,null,1422199985,null,0,false,0,co09y8r,null,t3_2tlvcm,null,t1_co09y8r,null,t1_co07ktv,null,null,null,1424400428,null,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

null,false,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,null,"That's... a tough question, as I generally avoid talking about hypotheticals. Aspas seems as good as gone, regardless of what happens, so it's a matter of what to do with the other two. 

The way I see it, with Liverpool, you are signing attributes in a body, as opposed to a striker with a name. It is becoming apparent that with Rodgers, you need someone who can fit the style of play, as he is simply unwilling/unable to change tactics based on the available squad. Borini has the mentality, but not the technical ability required for a CL level. Balotelli... is a luxury jewel to play when everything else clicks, not an essential cog in the machine. He's the chrome hood ornament on your Jaguar, not the engine. So yes, Aspas and Borini I would offload, but what then? What about Balotelli? With that, one needs to look at the larger picture and include Sturridge in the equation as well.

Sturridge is great, but he poses a massive dilemma: you either manage your transfer window with him in mind as your first-choice forward or you manage it with him discounted, knowing that there is a noteworthy chance of him missing a part of the season through injury. In other words, you either buy a forward to play alongside him or instead of him. 

With Balotelli, we have seen what happens if you rely on Sturridge being there for the whole season. But if you sign a striker to alternate with Sturridge and Sturridge remains fit, what do you do? You could move Sturridge to the wing, but then consistently playing on the wing is the reason he left Chelsea. So you are risking an unhappy Sturridge and poor squad atmosphere. Or you bench your new 'world class' signing, which you can do as Man City but not as Liverpool. 

You'd almost expect Sturridge to get injured, but what is the point of having a striker who breaks down constantly? Your Jaguar then becomes an Alfa Romeo. I had a neighbour with an Alfa Romeo once. The thing spent 200 days of the year at a mechanic's and the other 165 in a garage, as the chap was too afraid to take it for a ride. 

Of course, you could sign someone who can do both: play alongside him *or* instead of him. But then you're looking at a very versatile forward and, at a 'world class' level, these don't come around very often. And if they do, do we have enough draw as a club to attract this sort of player? I just don't think it is realistic for us to expect the club to sign someone like that - if it happens, great, but I wouldn't count on it as part of the equation. 

So, if you ask me, in the grand scheme of things, the problem isn't Balotelli or Borini, the problem we chiefly need to concern ourselves with is Sturridge. It's the Agger situation: world class centre back, but he can't prevent many goals from a hospital bed. So I'd say we should be signing someone less injury prone to replace Sturridge with. Keep them both for a season, so the first striker settles in, and after that Sturridge either adapts to the new situation at the club or we sell him at a very hefty profit (or we learn the new chap isn't as good as we thought and offload him instead). 

Now, as to your two suggestions (Benzema and Lacazette). Benzema I see playing occasionally but, whilst a proven goalscorer, I think he would suffer from the same problem others accuse Balotelli of: lack of defensive work. I am by no means a Benzema expert (I watch Liverpool, as that is just about what I have time for), but he strikes me as someone who would need to adapt to our style of play and I'm not sure the massive financial investment would be worth the risk. 

As for Lacazette... I have seen him play maybe once or twice, so I'm not in a position to comment at all. He seems to be having a good season at Lyon, but I really do wish we would stop signing players based on one good season... 

My... that was a lot of words, sorry!

I don't expect you to read the judgements from each of the justices (I had to and it is a punishment I would wish on no other human being), however if you are interested and decide to try and read it I find the opinions of Bingham, Steyn and Nicholls most helpful. 

Small digest: 'Jackson' argued that the Hunting Ban Act of 2004 was illegitimate because the Parliament Act of 1949 had been used to force it through the House Of Lords. Bingham sums it up nicely in his first paragraph:

"" They challenge the legal validity of the Hunting Act 2004 which, on its face, makes it an offence to hunt a wild mammal with a dog save in limited circumstances. The appellants acknowledge that the legislative procedure adopted to enact the Hunting Act was in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Parliament Act 1949. But they contend that the 1949 Act was itself invalid: it did not, as they correctly say, receive the consent of the House of Lords; and the Parliament Act 1911 did not, they submit, permit an Act such as the 1949 Act to be enacted without the consent of the House of Lords. Thus, although the Hunting Act gives rise to the present issue between the appellants and the Attorney General, the real question turns on the validity of the 1949 Act and that in turn depends on the true effect of the 1911 Act. ""

Point being that newer legislation, the courts will assume, overrides older legislation where there is a conflict. In cases involving international laws its rare that it is a conflict between our laws and international laws. Rather it is usually more to do with the actions of the Executive versus international law. Parliament doesn't normally pass laws which clearly conflict with international laws the UK is signed up to (though I believe there are some notable exceptions).",null,0,null,1422202699,null,0,false,0,co0b23f,null,t3_2tj00u,null,t1_co0b23f,null,t1_co04aa6,null,null,null,1424399912,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

/r/BritishPolitics is a place that outright bans racism and associated bigotry- it's one of the primary motivations behind its foundation, even. 

/r/ukipparty both shares moderators with and endorses what is, for all intents and purposes, a White Power subreddit in their sidebar- /r/European - *instead of* /r/Europe. 

/r/European, for the unaware, exists because the /r/Europe moderation team pulled their act together and started clamping down on racists *hard* over the past year and a half or so. Denied their usual haunt, they bounced away and set up a vicious little circlejerk of their own under the aegis of ""free speech"". 

In isolation, a ""free speech"" subreddit isn't necessarily a bad thing. But in this case, where it's both run by outright white supremacists and largely populated by the same, with a sprinkling of fascists and neoreactionaries to spice up the cocktail, we take issue with it. 

/r/ukipparty essentially have an endorsement of White Supremacist website in their sidebar. We absolutely refuse to have anything at all to do with that kind of thing.

I take people around the halls of residence too though, and some of the financial pain is definitely self inflicted. When I applied, I did the sums before I went to university, worked out I could only afford the cheapest halls and therefore went for their. Most of the girls I meet doing accomodation tours balk at the idea of sharing a bathroom in halls, which puts the cost up by £1k before they even start. Then people are absolutely determined to get on the accomodation with the nice view of the lake, or one as close to campus as is possible, and the price goes up again.

It's similar in private rented accomodation too. There are some shitholes around, but I've found it very easy to find somewhere nice that's cheaper than average every year, just by being prepared to walk a bit further. My weekly rent is about £15 a week less than a lot of my friends, for what amounts to about a 3 minute longer walk.

I'd say having public execution as a legal consequence to what I said makes it pretty big on scale. As in, legislated for the entire country kind of scale.

The government increased welfare, pay and raised educational standards due to discontent in the Arab world.

People being complacent to the abuses that face them is not justification for the abuses in the first place.

Kaboul was the wrong choice for captain, but far more worryingly our most valuable assets and players who could get us up to the champions league is they regained their previous form have by and large been left on the scrapheap. Its all well and good that he has got Benteleb and Mason playing well, but the rest of our central midfield seem pale imitations of their past selves. As for strikers, yes, he has done wonders with Harry Kane. Far better than I thought he would be this summer. But has he got the best out of Soldado and Adebayor? Has he even gotten close? When an inexperianced Harry Redknapp tribute act like Tim got Adebayor scoring then a 'good' manager should be able to.

I know it is unfair to blame the manager for the failure of a player as it can be the players fault, but when you have players worth tens of millions of pounds being paid hundreds of thousands a week then the managers role can and should be questioned. I'm not saying that Van Gaal would have gotten the best out of Paulinho, Dembele, Capoue, Stambouli, Kaboul, Adebayor and Soldado, but he might have done?

Bristol is hellish expensive (according to my friend at university there) compared to where I am (Manchester). From my own experience, Manchester would be pretty good; the prices are reasonable and the public transport in some parts is good. It's got lots of young people due to the universities and good shopping, plus the football etc. attracts people. The BBC has also put more money into the area in recent years by moving a lot of stuff up there, and seem to be making their Salford hub a priority (according to what I've seen from their careers link on their website), so there's jobs there.
Probably controversial but Leeds isn't too bad (I'm biased though as I'm from there). It's recently had some redevelopment with the Trinity shopping centre right in the middle, and it's right on the East Coast main line with trains down to London twice an hour. And if you want scenic it's about half an hour on the train over to York which is the most beautiful city in England in my opinion, and full of museums and old architecture; plus Betty's tea rooms are just amazing. York is more expensive to live in though, hence why Leeds being so close means you can live where it's cheaper and catch a train over when you want a day out.
Other than that I can't really comment on many other places. Liverpool doesn't seem that bad. All you have to remember in general is that the North West has less of the older historic sites than the South or North East (according to my English Heritage maps anyway), and the South of England is more expensive than the North.

well... why did i have to spend 3 years complaining of enormous pain before anyone bothered to take me seriously?

i don't completely trust the NHS. my guess is sertraline is an expensive drug to produce and for every person spending £8 per month to take a course of 28 pills, drug companies make it, and charge the pharmacy a fortune for it, and then the government helps the pharmacy and bla bla... end of the day, someone is paying a high price for me to be able to get hold of sertraline at an affordable price, and one day whoever that person is, might turn around and day... sod the NHS and their patients, i want more money. then 1 day i go to get my pills and i can't because the pharmacy says ""we can't get hold of this anymore because the company refuses to make it"" or something like that.

it's the same problem i have with my infliximab infusions every 8 week for crohns disease. it costs £4000 per infusion to the NHS, but i pay nothing. one day, someone in charge is going to look for a very specific and meaningless reason to take me off it because David Cameron wants to save money, at the cost of fucking up my life even further. he doesnt care, im not his problem. why should he give me this treatment? he can just take it all away in a split second if he wanted.

thats what worries me.

also, how long does sertraline take to become fully effective? on some other posts i have made on reddit, telling people how much better im feeling, everyone seems to say it's just a placebo effect. i.e. the sertaline isnt actually working yet, but my brain thinks it is.

even as i type out this negatively put message to you, im not stressed or depressed, my mind is fine and im listening to music, im totally cool... am i really on a plaebo? this is my 4th day on the sert. the 1st day i took it, after 1 hour my heart was racing and i was filled with this enormous amount of energy. the fatigue in my legs was gone, i could finally run, walk, whatever. i was at my job like a zombie, not daydreaming or thinking about anything except the task on hand, with full efficiency. i was out of there delivering parcels 30 mins earlier than i normally was.

i ended up delivering 155 parcels that day and also had to return to the depot to get more in the middle of traffic and sure, i didn't finish working until 19:30pm but i plowed through the whole day and by the time i got home it felt like i was at work for 5 mins. the time flew by because i spent the whole day 100% focused, not thinking about anything except tasks, what to do next and so on.

i would never be like this off sertraline. i would spend the whole day moaning to myself, suicidal thoughts, depressing thoughts, angry, bitching to myself in the car all the time, bad mood, taking breaks. i didn't take a single break that 1st day on sertraline.

This is the flaw in the argument against /u/joepo32 because yes we can speculate what might have happened. We cannot guarantee what would happen but we can certainly speculate.

Your argument is no different to saying that we lost against Bradford yesterday because of Hazard being on the pitch. What? You disagree? Well you can't just speculate what would have happened if Hazard wasn't playing.

Let me show you how you can speculate about these things.

Imagine a scenario where City are 0-0 against United. It is the final minute of injury time and Lampard is waiting to be substituted on. Aguero is brought down in the box and it is a penalty, Lampard comes on. For his only touch of the game, Lampard slots that penalty home and City win the game 1-0.

Now tell me, is it possible to speculate what would have happened if someone else came on instead of Lampard? Is it really so difficult for people to guess that perhaps someone else could have taken that penalty and scored?

Well the exact same ability to speculate can be done to guess whether another person could have been in position and scored some of Lampard's other goals. Perhaps someone else might have even performed better.

I understand the argument that we cannot be sure someone else would have been better, but those people using this argument seem to have no problem with assuming that someone else would have been worse.

Okay, The government has put out a stat saying this number of people is likely to be falsely claiming benefits.. Where did they get that info?

I am sorry but if that stat was true it would be at 0%. If the government knew who was claiming benefits illegally then it would be sorting that out right?

Well clearly not. The gov is putting out stats saying ""Hey everyone it's fine your taxes aren't going to people falsely claiming it""

When infact I think its just all smoke to get people to shut up. The government has no way of knowing how many people falsely claim benefits so I am choosing to ignore what they say regarding that because it is 100% inaccurate data.

Find me accurate data and then maybe i'll reconsider my thoughts.
