null,false,SisterfromVegas,null,null,null,"Look [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/index) for r/London complete guide to finding a place to live. 

All the area's you've mentioned are extremely popular and demand is high. If your heart is set on living in hipster central (or any one specific part of London) then you need to be super proactive. You need to have website search alerts set up, check websites everyday and the second you see somewhere that looks good you phone up and get a viewing that night. Same with flat shares, same with everything. 

There is so much competition in London for the decent places (and half decent places) that if you're not on the ball you're screwed. The only reason I managed to get my last place was because I was the first to see it. I put down a deposit at the viewing and anyone who'd been booked to see it after me was out of luck. 

So make sure you know what you want. What's your price range? (remember you've got bills to pay as well). Are you sharing? How many people do you want to share with? Do you want housemates who get wasted and party every weekend or are you more a wine and movie kind of gal? What is essential for you? Is mold in the bedroom a deal breaker? Are you willing to sacrifice bedroom size for a place with a garden? How safe do you want to feel walking home at night?  

Don't be too fussy, but also know what you're looking for. And lastly, think about why you want to live in those areas. Is it the 'cool' factor? I mean, it's fine if you want to embrace that but don't dismiss other areas just because they don't have pop up art shows and raves in bookshops and the like.

null,false,agentdcf,flair8,,null,"The size of the spot indicates the likelihood of scoring from that shot, given a set of other factors. I don't recall all of them, but the big two are crosses v. through-balls and headers v. strikes. Shots taken from crosses (that is, when the ball is crossed and the player takes a shot) are substantially less likely to score than a shot taken from a through-ball, and strikes are (if I recall) more likely to score than headers. 

So when you combine the locations and types of shots, you get an ""expected goals"" figure (xG). Obviously, there's a lot of luck involved since a great save or a poorly taken shot can completely change the outcome whatever overall likelihood. Plus, this doesn't count missed shots, only shots on target (Soldado's ""incredible"" miss the other night wouldn't count then). 

But, when you look at things over the course of a season it does have decent predictive power and it can give you an indication of whether you really ""deserved"" to win or not. What this particular map shows quite well, I think, is that Sunderland's game plan basically worked: they wanted to sit deep and deny us quality chances while hitting on the break.

It's definitely forgiven, indeed tacitly endorsed, for such a relationship to exist if it's only physical, but trying to build a long term relationship within such a context is territory fraught with many pitfalls and we all know it.  What could he see in this young man?  What are they meant to talk about on a daily basis?

Yes. As I said right at the start, imagine being a member of the 'out-group"", somebody who isn't a member of the Church of England. It may sound a little clichéd, but Britain is a religiously diverse society and our monarchy should reflect that. She is the representative of *all* Britons, but by being so overtly linked to the CofE, it prevents her from being truly neutral figurehead for our nation.

Imagine if the Queen openly supported the Labour Party. That's great if you're also a Labour supporter, but for everyone else, you might get a little annoyed that the Queen is taking sides.

null,false,Obamanator91,cnty-scotland,Greeny Type,null,"&gt; Another problem with wind is that failing turbines can have a knock on effect on the frequency of the array's output which could potentially cause instabilities across the grid if it varies too far from 50Hz. You only have one turbine to worry about with a gas or nuclear plant.

You don't quite understand grid frequency control I think. The 'dispersed' nature of the turbines is much much better for not causing grid frequency instability. If you lose a single wind turbine that will not affect system frequency at all, it is tiny. However if you lose a large turbine, this will affect system frequency as it is a much larger percentage of the total system generation.  

The problems with wind turbines is that they are converted through power electronics, Therefore they do not supply any inertia to the system. This means that when there is a fault on the system a cascade frequency drop is much more likely as frequency drops will happen much more quickly. This is because a large heavy machine spinning around takes time to slow down, providing a kind of 'brake' on the frequency drop. Wind turbines (in general) don't provide this. 

They can also often have very slight, but repeated, changes of output from varying wind gusts, this, along with their power converter coupling can cause harmonics on the system. But thats another problem entirely.

Banning encryption isn't banning snapchat and twitter, but it sure as hell does make those things difficult to legally use.

The same reason why nobody's framing it as 'Cameron wants to do away with the ATM' or 'UK government wants to take the UK off the internet altogether'. While all of those things will be direct ramifications of banning encryption, the only thing being considered for banning is encryption. To suggest otherwise would be misleading.

Apart from that, there are a few technical errors you should consider fixing:

1. AES is not the same type of thing as PGP. The former is an encryption algorithm and the latter a piece of software (or alternatively, an encrypted message format) that uses a variety of encryption algorithms. A more appropriate abstract comparison may have been between symmetric and asymmetric encryption, which I think was what you were getting at anyway with your examples.

2. SSH does not use SSL. Both protocols have the similar aim of setting up an encrypted data connection between two hosts, but they are separate. They do use the same type of underlying cryptography to achieve that end, but in different ways. (You may have meant SSH as in the software, but that uses the SSH protocol, not SSL.)

3. You claim that ""creating strong encryption software is trivially easy"". On the contrary, it is very difficult to create real-world cryptosystems that are resistant to attack. Or to put it another way, it's easy to unintentionally misuse cryptographic primitives in such a way that they are rendered insecure. [This page](http://cybersecurity.ieee.org/center-for-secure-design/use-cryptography-correctly.html) gives a decent summary of some of the more common pitfalls in this regard. There are many, many examples of such broken systems.

null,false,MrFuckingRandom,null,null,null,"I'm all for equality, when equal work is done. However, the reality is that men's sports are, in some cases (though not all) harder. 

For instance, men in tennis play up to 5 sets rather than the 3 women may play. If the male competition winner played 5 sets in every match and the female winner played 3 in every match, then the male winner has done significantly more work in terms of time, and at a faster pace. Someone else could do the maths, but those 2 sets per match would add up to several more matches played per tournament than the female counterpart. Where's the equality in that?

In some other sports (eg: darts, as another person said), the difference in work done is significantly less so there is an argument for equal remuneration. However, athletes are generally not paid for the work they do as a general standard. They are paid for their marketability and crowd attraction. For whatever reason, the male events tend to attract bigger crowds so the males are rewarded for the crowd drawn with bigger fees. However, this isn't necessarily a gender issue - at least not directly - as it affects 'inferior' male athletes in the same way. As an example, there are plenty of harder-working football players than Lionel Messi, but he is better paid than the majority of the footballing world - men and women alike - because he draws crowds which earn his sponsors money.

Calling this a gender issue doesn't really work when there is no equality within genders to begin with. Instead, you have to look for a factor which plays its part irrespective of gender and that is the athletes ability to generate cash for the organisation paying them. 

The real question is why the male athletes tend to generate more cash than the female athletes, but that can only be explained by us, the spectators who pay for them.",null,0,null,1421548575,null,0,false,0,cnsgmjt,null,t3_2sqwmb,null,t1_cnsgmjt,null,t3_2sqwmb,null,null,null,1424817117,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

Downside? You can't fill your cup all the way to the top, there's a max-line about halfway down, so you can't blend very much at once, maybe a tin's worth of contents.

null,false,TheColinous,cnty-scotland,Scotland,null,"The criticism about us Greens as being anti-science because of nuclear is odd, because the rethoric itself is decidedly anti-scientific. 

First, it fails to take a view of the whole supply chain for nuclear fuel, from extracting uranium to storing the waste products. Extraction is an extremely filthy form of mining which requires quite a lot of worker protection because otherwise they suffer things like Radon poisoning. Since uranium production tends to be done in third world countries, one can assume that such worker production in the main does not happen. And I, for one, doesn't want to require third world workers to basically poison themselves to that I can run my gadgets. Secondly, transport to and from the nuclear reactors require a lot more than just loading the shit into a lorry. Third, waste products have to be dealt with, and that's not easy. So, on the whole, the supply chain for nuclear is marred with precautions and excess and cost and dangers.

Additionally, the nuclear power always trotted out is water cooled fission reactors, the worst kind of reactor, because they require massive subsidies from the state in order to be profitable. The reactor types must install massive safety measures in order to not be ticking time-bombs that, if things go horribly wrong, will mean catastrophic poisoning of whole regions making those regions uninhabitable for centuries if not millennia. The way to prevent that is to front-load the reactor so much that the power generated will be the most expensive form unless there are subsidies from the state for each kW/h produced.

And furthermore, nobody is talking about alternative forms of nuclear power like Thorium reactors or pebble bed modular reactors because there are no technical blueprints and such for them. They require extensive bits of testing and research yet, and won't be availible. So, the only technical solution on the table are the water cooled reactors. Claiming that 'we should support nuclear because thorium' is, at this stage, much like claiming 'we should support nuclear because of fusion'.

Admittedly, alternative forms of nuclear are probably not high on the agenda for Greens and like most they won't even think about those types of solutions. It will be a more knee-jerk reaction to water cooled reactors than that. But hey, the alternative types do not exist yet except as possibilities for further research.",null,0,null,1421549314,null,0,false,0,cnsgyku,null,t3_2sq757,null,t1_cnsgyku,null,t1_cns8la6,null,null,null,1424816960,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

You're right, it is a bit of a mess - I tried cutting it down a few times but I always ended up adding more content than I was removing. After spending most of my evenings this week on it though I can't really justify spending any more time on it. Writing is not one of my strongest skills but I thought it was good enough for people to get a good grasp of the situation.

&gt; AES is not the same type of thing as PGP.

Yeah it reads a bit funny for those familiar with the terms, they're not directly comparable but I didn't want to get sidetracked explaining the difference between an algorithm/standard and a software implementation (or the difference between PGP and OpenPGP). I just wanted to make sure the terms were broadly introduced.

&gt; SSH does not use SSL.

Thanks, I've tidied this section up a bit.

&gt; You claim that ""creating strong encryption software is trivially easy"". On the contrary, it is very difficult to create real-world cryptosystems that are resistant to attack.

Sorry yes that was a bit disingenuous. I've clarified that I meant putting something together from libraries rather from scratch. Obviously designing new cryptographic primitives is incredibly difficult, and likewise building cryptographic applications for production use is very hard - however using existing libraries like cryptojs to build educational value projects is not.

1) His interviews and general media handling is dreadful.  Not only is it painful to listen to and occasionally ridiculous (e.g. 'if you spend £100M you should be winning the league') but it has a negative effect on acquisition targets as well (Salah, as an example).

2) He's awful at handling players he doesn't rate.  His treatment of Downing, Agger, Sakho, Reina, Balotelli (who I don't rate either, admittedly, but still think is getting far too much shit from BR in public) and others has been abysmal.

3) He has no plan whatsoever to integrate young players into the side.  So far it's been ship them on loan somewhere, let them rot in the reserves, or simply buy more players on top of them for no particular reason rather than simply giving them a chance.

4) Every season we start badly.  Why?  Because he keep trying to go back to that nonsense 'control possession' crap in his 300 page playbook that has now been proven not to work 3 times in a row.  Why he hasn't figured out yet that passing it around between the center backs is never going to work is well beyond me and I have no faith that if he were still in charge next season he wouldn't try to do it again with the same near-disastrous results.  Added to which it's just awful to watch.

5) Transfers.  Awful nearly all around bar a couple.  Not 100% his fault many would say due to the 'committee' structure, which is why I would do away with that notion as well as it's clearly flawed.

Who?

In the summer, if I were FSG, I would do my absolute best to try and get Cryuff in as DoF.  We tried before and he didn't want the job, but I think maybe with Van Gaal at United he might be just about tempted enough to come out of semi-retirement to help smash him.

For manager, that would be up to the DoF as the two need to be able to have a good relationship.  De Boer would certainly be the top of the list I would think.

If Cryuff can't be convinced to take it, I would go for Monchi who has done a remarkable job at Sevilla (assuming he isn't already at Barca by then).  Same thing, he gets to pick the manager he could work with.

So, that's why and who for me.  ",null,0,null,1421556978,null,0,false,0,cnsk7ss,null,t3_2sqv4v,null,t1_cnsk7ss,null,t1_cnsigj2,null,null,null,1424815404,null,-3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-3,null

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"Put it this way, Jose Mourinho and the board has solved the three missing links that were in our lineup for a good 3-4 seasons - Matic, Fabregas and Diego Costa. We now have a **strong holding mid** (since Makelele) to win the ball in midfield, a *volante* (**playmaker**) to pull the strings, and a **top striker** to score the goals. 



To complement the above core three, Mourinho has assembled three ""roaming"" small-sized attacking Mids/Wingers who have a scary link up play understanding among them (and they also contribute to the score sheet). 




At the back, we have the twin pillars of Stamford Bridge breaking down opposition play and bring height into set plays. Behind them is a 22 year old keeper who has won the La Liga, played in a Champions League final and won La Liga GK of the year. And then there's the two wing backs of Chelsea that links defense and attack. Finally, the bench - with a good mix of Chelsea legends and promising young talent.



In summary, this is **Mourinho engineering** - efficient, fluid, creative and defensively strong.

IMO this argument is one that makes sense in the days before computers, but not really so much today.

During his lifetime, Jimmy Savile was interviewed 3 or 4 times about allegations made against him, but because the accusations predated the computerised national database (or most of them did), the latter cops who interviewed him knew nothing of the previous accusations.

The previous allegations about Savile, and the interviews with him, were recorded on paper, filed in filing cabinets in Yorkshire, and the Surrey cops who subsequently interviewed him were unaware of them. 

Any complaint made today will be stored on computer and will be revealed immediately, if a corroborating complaint is made. 

I understand why victims might be reluctant to come forward, particularly in the past, but that's the victim's own choice. If a victim decides to come forward, or not to, then its their decision, and it's not for the plod to go out canvassing about individual suspects.

And for the record, why wouldn't they operate in this way? When a seemingly innocuous statement can be manipulated and used against you by the ruthless, self-serving animal that is football media, then the incentive is surely to summon your best Michael Owen visage (or whatever you please) and rattle off meaningless football cliches. So yes, it's irrelevant beyond what the fans think of it. 

You second point is ridiculous. There is clearly some political agenda with his decisions with man management which can at times be a fault, but he has given ample evidence that he is capable of getting the most out of players who he believes in. Hendo, Sterling, Sturridge, Suarez, Flanno (to name a few) have all excelled under his management. You won't give him credit for these, I imagine? Your opinion, again, seems to be influenced by what you've seen in the media. And again, it's so painfully misguided. 99% of his man management will go on behind the scenes and with this imperfect information you have to look at the results. 

And finally, your last point. Well, I just disagree. He's sending young players on ""random loans"", you think? Are we really going to debate the benefits of sending a player on loan to get experience? Rodgers has been always given youth a chance, and sure at times he's had to, but to suggest he hasn't given them a chance is ridiculous. Look at Sterling. Look at Flanno. That isn't ""no idea"". Out of curiosity, what would you do differently?

For me personally, I'm not at all that worried about his lack of goals (since I have followed all our matches and he got unlucky many times). One major argument I would propose is that he, along with all our strike-force, are very unselfish and are willing to do it for the team (one-twos, coordinated passes, tiki taka, lay ups). **And** Willian is a work-horse the way he tracks back, runs forward, take part in attacks, win balls in midfield. 




I will be worried if our forwards aren't scoring goals but Willian is an important part of [Mourinho engineering](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/2ssx4t/ive_been_out_of_epl_for_a_while_but_chelsea_seems/cnsn684).",null,0,null,1421566996,null,0,false,0,cnsnl98,null,t3_2stavg,null,t1_cnsnl98,null,t3_2stavg,null,null,null,1424813797,null,7,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,7,null

It was an entirely different style of play in my mind- sit deep, maintain possession, don't counterattack quickly, don't press v pushing bodies forward, less concern about losing possession, counter quickly, and press in packs when possession is lost to regain the ball.

A) sticks his foot in it (the £100M comment being a good example of a stupid comment)

B) says something stupid about on of our players (all of the talk about Balotelli being a good example of that)

C) says something stupid which causes a potential target to have concerns about joining (Salah and Valdes being two I can think of)

If he wants to use generic footballisms and talk about teamwork, synergy, or whatever then fine, but the three above are not that at all.

The ones you've mentioned have all done well under BR.  Why would I not acknowledge what is clearly true?  That does not mean he handles everyone well at all though as he clearly doesn't, which is what my point is.  The 'media' point is about the dumbest thing I can think of and I don't know why people on here say things like that.  I'm not English and the amount of times I've seen Liverpool mentioned on CNN is pretty well 0.

He does not give youth a chance.  Sterling got his due to injury and Flanagan got his chance  initially under Kenny.  What do I think he should do differently?  Loads.

1). Work closely with a limited number of clubs on a loan system, something more similar to what Chelsea does with Vitesse.

2).  Don't send players on loans and then buy similar aged players in the same positions.  Examples- bring in Alberto, send Suso on loan.  Bring in Mamquillo, send Wisdom on loan.  What is the point of that?

3). If we send a player on loan, we need to ensure they still have regular contact with the club.  Chelsea, as an example, pays ex-players to check in weekly with loanees in person, usually for dinner or whatever, and act as a liaison between club and player.  It's a simple idea, but a great one.

4). If a young player does actually get a chance with the first team and they play well, play them again.  Rossiter scored and had a good game, hasn't been on the pitch since.  Last season Teixeira played well, hasn't played since.  Give them a 2nd chance as well, not just a single 15 minute cameo.

5). If we're well ahead in a game, throw some kids on.  Last season we won a lot of games by 2 plus goals but still had a sub or two to make.  Perfect time to give the older kids chances and I have no idea why we didn't take advantage of it.

If you didn't, everyday life was similar to that on the UK mainland, although the general standard of living was a little lower and you had to accept there was going to be the occasional military roadblock or checkpoint.

If you lived in a sectarian-riven estate (and they nearly all tended to be on quite grim estates) then things were very different: you'd expect to be regularly stopped and searched at gunpoint by the army or RUC, especially if you were young and male. There would also have been a constant back-of-the-mind paranoia that at any moment men with guns could come into the neighbourhood to try to kill someone. I imagine in that respect it would have been like living in a gang-ridden part of a large US city.

In either case, however, you'd have likely only mixed with people from the same side of the sectarian divide. There were almost no mixed (i.e. Catholic &amp; Protestant) schools back then, and so society was polarised even amongst the majority who wanted nothing to do with the violence.

&gt; However, if it's a choice between abandoning a system similar to Trident and moving to a different delivery method then I'd choose disarmament as a system similar to Trident is the only one worth having because of the second strike capability; the very aspect that makes it a deterrent. Anything else would be a waste of money. 

&gt; The only valid argument I recognise for complete disarmament is saving money but I think the benefits outweigh the costs. 
&gt; There is no evidence that a UK disarmament would make the world a safer place as people tend to claim. It wouldn't convince other nations, rouge states or groups that have nuclear weapons to also abandon them, nor would it dissuade other countries from seeking them. 

&gt; Likewise the UK is a fully functioning, stable democracy that has no extremist tendencies. It is a permanent member of the UNSC and a recognised nuclear weapons state.

In fact they are so terrible, they are unworkable (or impractical) because of the ramifications - banking, commerce, communication will be radically changed and could cause major economic problems, making this unworkable (but not impossible to do in the first place).

Anyone that realises this will find it ludicrous (or you know, terrifying that it's even being contemplated).

oddly enough, i'm fine with that... as long as it doesn't become the norm (how could it, far too expensive) and is overseen by a judicial process. if the agencies have enough evidence to convince a judge that you are a threat (and the legal system isn't a mockery like the parallel courts established in the US...) then fine.

sadly it feels as though that boat has already sailed. the talk of criminalising the use of encryption is chilling. the RIPA powers alone make me wonder if it's safe to travel to the UK with encrypted data (which i must have due to employment requirements...) if some busybody immigration desk worker decided to make my life difficult (on a whim. it happens!) i'd be faced with a choice between giving up keys or potentially spending two years in prison, having broken no laws, except the one that laughs in the face of privacy.

anyway, there isn't going to be an effort to ban the use of encryption in the corporate world. the legal / liability issues it would turn the UK / US banking sectors into international pariahs. it feels far more likely that they'll eventually propose a multitiered system where the use of strong / non-compromised encryption is limited to organisations to whom the governments are beholden (financial institutions, insurers, etc) or can control (government agencies, arms dealers, critical infrastructure providers, ISPs, etc) with either money or license to operate agreements. 

the big internet companies (amazon, google, facebook, apple) will be forced to sign up codes of conduct that allow the agencies to mine their data... and it'll all be done with very quiet threats.

nothing overt will be done to stop the non-mainstream, open source, encryption tools, but it will be stated that the development or use of such tools will be taken as a signal that this is a ""person of interest"". it'll never actually stop development / use, but the climate of fear, the use of infiltration to compromise software, will take it's toll over time. this will lead to an erosion of trust, neutralising the (perceived) threat.

I can't help you with the other questions but I assume your solicitor/conveyancer can, especially as there are even more legal pitfalls with an auction property than a regular one.

In Balotelli's career he has always played best as part of a front two and almost always performed poorly as a lone striker.

Anyone who wants to learn how to do that can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G8dPAdmyss)

My feeling is that talking about ""right to privacy"" just isn't going to make any difference, because it will be countered with ""well, if you've got nothing to hide then you've got nothing to fear.""

What might make a difference is talking about how this will damage British businesses' ability to protect themselves against corporate espionage by foreign companies.  This would lead either to the British companies being out-competed and therefore having to shut down, or to them leaving Britain for a country which is more business friendly - in either case this proposed law can cause economic damage.

Obviously we don't know the details of the law yet - but given that the government already has the powers to demand decryption keys there are two main forms it could take.  One is making encryption illegal.  The other would be prohibiting the use of encryption which does not contain a backdoor allowing the government (including the security services) to decrypt it.  Unfortunately a backdoor allowing the government to decrypt traffic could very plausibly be compromised by other state or corporate agencies which would mean that anything encrypted using this method may as well be in plain text.",null,0,null,1421580185,null,0,false,0,cnsqbdg,null,t3_2ss0m6,null,t1_cnsqbdg,null,t1_cnsjxoi,null,null,null,1424812479,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

One thing though-doesn't a show have to end to become public domain or am I mistaken? I mean, long-running dramas that are still going (Eastenders, Top Gear, Game of Thrones, whatever) aren't public domain (although obviously none of them have been running *that* long of course) but I always thought that a thing had to be finished and done for a certain length of time to be public domain.

No it couldn't. It's far more expensive than 2 boilers.

&gt;After he got quotes of between £4,500 and £5,000 fromSWALEC and British Gas, he worked out that by the time he had added in the cost of finance, total repayments would have been closer to £11,000 – and that was without paying for any future service plans or repairs. “There was no upfront payment. Instead, I’m now paying £37 a month for the next 12 years, which sounds like a lot but I know that that’s all I will ever have to pay as the whole heating system is covered against future repairs. I think it will cost £7,000 in total.

This does not seem to be true. Even if it was £4,500 (which I don't believe is true because the boiler is less than £1,000) then the labour costs don't add up.

He says £37 a month for 12 years at £7,000? That doesn't add up either. That only comes to £444 per year, and £5,328 in total.

Herbicide resistance is a problem with all crops, not specifically GM.

Contamination of non-GM crops (and wild and weedy relatives) is very, very overblown. There has not been a creation of a 'superweed'. But you are right, hybridisation, and introgression of GM does occur. However, several new methods of producing GM crops, specifically designed to remove any chance of hybridisation now exist: a herbicide susceptibility, which acts as an inbuilt weakness, meaning that any plant that takes up the GM material can be very easily killed off, and the future of GM lies in chloroplast transformation, where DNA in the chloroplast is transformed rather than in the nucleus. Chloroplast DNA is inherited maternally, it is not produced in making pollen, so you get a GM plant that produces non GM pollen. 

The truth of the matter is that unless we want to face huge threats to our food security within the next 100 years we need to adopt GM. The faster we do, and the more infrastructure that is put into place to develop and distribute GM crops now the better.

Not iOS, but I've done mobile dev... Things move quickly in Mobile development. Keeping up can be hard.

iOS/Obj-C is useful to have, but the trend seems to be that it's moving away somewhat from native development at the moment and into more HTML5 based technologies. If you look at job listings for iOS at the moment you'll often see 'experience in HTML5' etc in the 'desirable' list at least (one example: http://www.nijobs.com/Mobile-App-iOS-Technical-Design-Job-1081929.aspx)

So you write your app as a single page HTML5 app, and package it via Cordova/Phonegap into something deployable on both iOS and Android (And Windows Phone, Blackberry if you so desire)

There are quite a few frameworks popping up around this. JQuery Mobile (with Backbone.js) would be your best bet. Sencha Touch seems popular. I know of at least one development house in Belfast using the 'Parse' framework.

I hate to suggest things I haven't done myself, but in the absence of industry experience I'd consider getting a Github account, and firing up a range of demo apps to show what you're capable of.  iOS native, some HTML5. The more boring and enterprise-y the better. Survey apps that capture a GPS location and/or photo, sent it back to a server. App that updates in real time based on some online data source. App that lets a user query an online database, pull down information, and send back an update to that information. That sort of thing. Don't have to be production grade, but coded nice and cleanly.

I went one better and looked at the underlying source material that was submitted as written evidence, ""The Future of The British Bomb"".

I was particularly tickled by the following paragraph from Page 14:

""Russia is not regarded as a current threat or likely to become a future threat. The old enemy is now included on the fringes of NATO through Partnership for Peace. The Royal Navy has assisted in dealing with the disaster on the Kursk and the rescue of trapped submariners in the Russian Pacific fleet. Concern about an invasion of Western Europe no longer dominates British conventional military planning. Yet in the nuclear field it appears that policy makers are reluctant to abandon the past. There is a need to move beyond the cautious views expressed by Michael Quinlan and Malcolm Rifkind in the early 1990s. The timid approach to change can itself be dangerous""

That's more than sufficient to demonstrate that we live in a changing world and we can no more predict the geopolitical situation ten years from now than those ten years ago could predict it today.

But I think we should use the flexibility of the formation to counter them. Three center backs is usually seen as very defensive backline. We, however, aren't even close to being defensive team - there's nice balance to our gameplan. So, as a small tactical move, we could have wingbacks more reserved (only one is in advanced position at the same time, if even that) in their attacks and it would flood the midfield and congest their attacking third. they are well capable of passing through congested defences, but if we give their midfielders no room to pass (high pressing) we might be able to muffle their attacks. 

On counter attacks we could have Sterling and Coutinho support the attacker(currently Borini, I guess) and occasionally get our quick wingbacks to join the attack.

Using any formation well against Chelsea is tricky but I think that one has the ability to counter them.

1. Should the police identify culprits
2. Should people be allowed to gossip about people getting arrested or charged

Currently, for (1) we say no until they've been charged. For you to be charged, the CPS has to be confident that you're guilty and the evidence meets the criteria that on the balance of probabilities you'll probably be found guilty in court. Then it goes into the court records, and that's all public information anyway.

For (2) we say that we have a free press, so unless it's a special case, you're allowed to talk about it. The biggest currently protected set of special cases is youth offenders, where there is an obvious reason - they're under 18 and impressionable, they should be given greater opportunity to reform.

I'm open-minded about giving some people anonymity if they need it - but to my mind there is no justification that those arrested or charged with rape need it. The deck is already stacked in their favour. If I'm arrested for assault, or theft, or murder, and that's published, most people will assume it's true. If I'm arrested for rape, and that's published, far more people will believe it's false.

What's more interesting about this schism is we've studied it, it's been published, journalists cover it - yet when it comes to it actually happening people's pre-judgements revert again to ""I know Jack, he couldn't have done that. She must have just regretted it after drinking too much.""

You can recreate nandos sooooo easily it's a shame to pay for it.

Dessert:
dip balloon into melted chocolate, cool n pop to create edible bowl then fill with ice cream or whatever else and decorate.  Really cheap but still impressive end product plus it can be prepared ahead of shedule so you just take it out of freezer. You could even personalise it with her name or something else to mark your 1st/2nd date and have 1 inedible piece to have as a keepsake.  

Any of the typical places in bel for a date can be pretty pricey if you're out often, then again if your dating someone that insists on upmarket restaurants and not having to pay you should bail. My dates were always 50/50 or alternating if we were out paying and I had some good long term relationships from that. You don't want to just be someones meal ticket when they're in the mood and there are girls out there that do it.


If you happen to hit up a club or something one cheap romantic thing to invest in is keeping the wristbands for a keepsake. Come the 1year anniversary you can surprise her with the memento of your first night out maybe even along with a photo of the night.

Section 2. [**Paradox of the heap**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox#Paradox_of_the_heap) of article  [**Sorites paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites%20paradox): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The word ""sorites"" derives from the Greek word for heap. The paradox is so named because of its original characterization, attributed to [Eubulides of Miletus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eubulides).  The paradox goes as follows: consider a [heap](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/heap) of sand from which [grains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain) are individually removed. One might construct the argument, using [premises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premise), as follows: 

&gt;&gt;*1000000 grains of sand is a heap of sand* (Premise 1)

&gt;&gt;*A heap of sand minus one grain is still a heap.* (Premise 2)

7/7 bombers said they were doing it due to UK foreign Policies    
Woolwich killers were ranting about Muslims being killed aboard

3 major terrorist attacks, all with confessions, all say foreign policy. Adam Deen is being dishonest here. The foreign Policy helps recruit people into violent extremism with the bullshit idea that there is this so called war between the muslim world and west, when in fact the war on terror is a cover for greater access to the world oil supply in the region. People forget Afghanistan sits on a large amount of lithium deposits.

Which Afghanistan? The soviet invaded one? the one that the US armed and supported the Mujahideen to fight the dirty godless commies or the Afghanistan that hide Al Qaeda and is ruled by the dominate faction of the Mujahideen known as the taliban?

null,false,Mildcorma,null,null,null,"We NEEDED to get depth!  That's exactly what we needed, not a star player, not two or three players, but a second squad to see us through the huge fixture list compared to last season.  Rodgers has spent a good amount of money on players we needed.  Good money for good players, but in today's market that price is about £15-£20m per player on average, and we picked up everyone we wanted really.  This sub was STOKED with the new signings as they all fit in, apart from the late addition of Baotelli, but that's another story.  He got what we needed.

The second part to this is that we are doing alright, much like the start of his first season in fact.  When Rodgers started out, what we saw was a number of good ideas trying to take form, but not really doing so until the January window, where we went almost undefeated iirc.  We then came into the next season as a team wholly and completely, and continued the form we had enjoyed beforehand.  This season we have a new squad pretty much, so it just takes time for the team to get used to each other.  That's all it is, and that's where we are now.

It's not the fenway way to pay megabucks and get in one of the 4-5 managers around that can come into a team and win immediately, providing they have the transfer budget to match.  It's the fenway way to allow time for development from the ground up, even if it takes 5-6 seasons.

I can't stand it when people are so critical of a man who came into this side unproven, then came second.  He masterminded the development of Suarez from a good striker, but hardly outstanding, into this absolute man beast who was arguably the third best player in the world.  Henderson, the midfielder who was shit, has bloomed under rodgers into an england player, and someone who we need to start each game due to his workrate.  Flanadanadingdong couldn't get a loan at a league one team, and now he's sought after.  Sturridge was a second rate striker at Chelsea who couldn't make it happen, and now he's one of the best in the PL, scoring 21 last season.  Sterling has gone from a good talent to a world class player who will be with one of the bigger teams in the next few seasons.  This guy, Brendan, this one man, has done incredible things that proven PL managers couldn't get close to beforehand.  He's given Fenway a 5 year plan and come good in two, and you want to take shots at him for having an average season?

People these days seem to want everything, now.  If Man U had listened to their fans after fergie fucked it up for a few seasons, they'd still be nothing.  Time makes a massive difference.  We don't NEED to win everything, now.  We can become so much better than the teams above us, but we won't do it if people get pissed off at the smallest things.",null,0,null,1421590726,null,0,false,0,cnssj47,null,t3_2sry1d,null,t1_cnssj47,null,t1_cnsrtz1,null,null,null,1424811447,null,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4,null

null,false,eldudovic,lfc55,,null,"I think you are wrong. In my opinion the possession based football is caused by not having the right players. We passed it around the back because there was noone to pass it to in midfield. Everyone was utterly static. Balotelli never made space for other players through making runs which naturally caused the midfield to cram up. Just passing about at the back can't have been the plan, because it would never lead to anything at all. We played like last season against Tottenham. At that point we had a mobile strikers who knew how to draw the opposition out of position. 

That's why Borini or Sterling has been great up top. They both run all the fucking time which makes it harder to mark our midfielders. It naturally creates bigger gaps between defense, midfield and forwards. These gaps are needed for Rodgers' passing triangles to work. 

I don't think Brendan wanted us to play shit football at the start of the season. I do however think he's a bit too fucking stubborn. Trying to fit square pegs in round holes. Mostly speaking about Gerrard and Balotelli. I said earlier this season that Sterling or Borini would be better fits, not because they're better strikers, but because they fit the way our team plays more. This whole sub has known that Gerrard isn't fit to play a defensive midfield role. If Brendan wasn't so stubborn we might've seen results earlier. I don't think he told the players ""Just create more space so that it's easier to pass"" however. We still play the same, only more effective.

-The museums are pretty great. The Ashmolean (History), Natural History Museum and the Pitt Rivers (Anthropology) are all pretty spectacular.

-We have two pretty good theatres here (New Theatre and The Oxford Playhouse) - it's worth catching a show if you can!

-Go around the historic pubs (eg: The Turf, where Clinton 'did not inhale,'  the Bear (one of the oldest and smallest pubs in the country) or the Eagle and Child (Tolkein used to write his books here). Or visit the Trout if you are an Inspector Morse fan.

I mean, we have pretty good bunch of young players, it would be beneficial to start moulding the team towards a certain style or a formation. Do we have a main formation? Some managers like old school 4-4-2, some like 4-3-2-1. Rodgers seems to be pretty flexible. He has a philosophy which is not changing, only the team is changing. 

WhoScored keeps track of formations teams play. Last season when I looked up the different formations managers played, I noticed that most use mainly one formation, occasionally something different. However, Rodgers was almost the only one who used 4-5 different formations. Not even just temporary fixes, every formation was used a good chunk of the season. **Mourinho, to total contrast, has used only one formation this season**. I like that Rodgers is so flexible, but is it all that beneficial?

So, my point - should we take this 3-4-2-1 (or 3-6-1, however you want to call it) and run with it? I think a consistent formation would help the team to find its legs quicker.

However, I think your reply demonstrates why this kind of argument is so fraught.  A layman like myself could reasonably conclude from your reply that the sensible course of action was to wait until these new methods were developed and fully tested.  Surely food production is more complex than just biology and genetics and requires input from multiple disciplines.

First, even a fairly small increase in spoiled ballots tends to get noticed - and it's not just candidates to fill in the gaps that can solve the discontent in that situation but existing ones that realise it's *those* votes they need to beat the other guy. For a single seat somewhere it might be hard because they can't exactly go against party policy.

But consider how close a run polls often are, and how little a push you actually need to win against the other side. At the moment most campaigning is done for that middle ground, the people who might vote Tory or Labour and it's just a matter of which way those swing voters will go this time around that can decide the whole election.

That is a huge problem, because it means the masses of disillusioned people are not only not voting, but generally they're not even being targeted by either main party.

This also leads to both parties finding a middle ground and basically coming aligned the same way - somewhere in the middle, so we have 2 centre parties. The same thing can be seen in the US - while the parties differ, there's no a huge range of views like you get in a lot of Europe, especially where coalitions are regularly formed from a huge range of parties.

But when there's more voters with a wider spectrum of views, and the ones who are far left or right who don't even bother voting cos they know a centre party and the status quo will stay - if these parties realise there's a mass of people willing to go out and vote *at all* and could be voting for them but aren't, they will are likely to either a) diverge, or b) both slide towards a truer representation of the will of the people in general. Which most data seems to suggest is left.

Not what you say is unfortunately majorly true - with FPTP it's a real issue to fixing this problem because this whole ""solution"" works much easier with PR, as each vote matters a lot more and as well as a person being more likely to feel their vote has value in the first place, it is more likely to actually help the party and politics they support in a very real way.

But with FPTP not voting is still far worse than spoiling a ballot, and it can still create the changes you want to see - it just takes more people and more effort, unfortunately. A disproportionate amount, even, which is why FPTP is such bs in the first place of course.

But hey, we're not getting PR or even AV any time soon by the looks of it - we had our chance at making the elected representatives more representative of our views and we blew it. Not a chance we get more than every few decades, so everyone needs to decide what they want to do that can actually make a difference under the current system instead of whining about FPTP, because that won't get you anywhere, while the alternative at least has a chance.",null,0,null,1421594180,null,0,false,0,cnstl7v,null,t3_2sq9c8,null,t1_cnstl7v,null,t1_cns34xw,null,null,null,1424810883,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

This has nothing to do with Homeopathy. The issue that most green party supporters either fail to realise or choose not to talk about its their animal testing policies.

The reason its anti-NHS/Academia/Pharmaceutical is due to the fact that multiple research methods require animal testing. If they ban it (which they state in their manifesto) this research cant take place.

* For academia it essentially means that people wont fund research in the UK because they get better results and can do more tests in countries outside of the UK. Less money into uni's = less money into the education

* For the Pharmaceutical industry, they cant use animal products and as such most basic reagents of tests cant be carried out. As a result its far cheaper and better to produce the pharmaceuticals outside of the UK. This leads to a reduction in jobs due to loss of research and production and in turn reduces the GDP of the UK

* For the NHS - again like academia many tests require animals or animal based reagents and as such pathology departments will be limited in what they can test for.

null,false,Alwaysfair,null,null,null,"I don’t like to make predictions. But here are two. First, if Labour win the next election they will not, contrary to last week’s claims by the Conservatives, increase planned public spending in 2015-16 by anything like £20 billion. Second, if the Conservatives win the election they will neither, despite what the opposition would have us believe, destroy the NHS nor return the welfare state to some Dickensian, or at least 1930s, level of provision.    

These hyperbolic claims are of course just part of normal pre-election rhetoric. At one level they are nonsense. But the competing claims do tell us something. This time around the stated fiscal positions of Labour and Conservatives are really very different. More different than at any election since at least 1992, and arguably since 1983.    

Suppose we look at what each party has said about their own aspirations, rather than at what they have said about each other. If we take their statements at face value then by 2020 an Ed Miliband led government would be borrowing and spending a lot more than a David Cameron led government. Conversely a Cameron led government would have implemented much more severe spending cuts than would one led by Miliband.    

Labour have said they want to achieve balance or surplus on the current budget. That is they would be happy to keep borrowing to pay for investment spending. At current levels of investment spending that would allow them to borrow around £25 billion a year. To achieve that they would need to find spending cuts, or tax increases, of around £7 billion after 2015-16. Perhaps not easy after so many years of austerity – and don’t forget both parties are signed up to a tough spending round in 2015-16 itself – but cuts of this magnitude over the rest of the parliament would be modest relative to what has been delivered thus far.    

The Conservative plans are rather different. They want to achieve a surplus on the overall budget and so would not be happy to borrow to invest. That means they would need to find spending cuts of around £33 billion after 2015-16. Lest there be any doubt, there is a big difference between £7 billion of cuts and £33 billion of cuts.    

In fact the difference between the parties may even greater than that. If you take the plans set out in the Autumn Statement at face value spending cuts of more than £50 billion could be required after 2015-16. It was this apparent ambition that led the Office for Budget Responsibility to warn that spending on public services could fall to its lowest level since the 1930s.    

One thing all the parties seem to agree on though is that spending on health, schools and pensions should be protected. But these are the biggest bits of spending. If these protections are continued the scale of Labour/Conservative differences can be seen particularly starkly. Under Autumn Statement plans Conservatives could be cutting unprotected budgets by 26% after 2015-16, or an extraordinary 41% over the whole period from 2010. Even just to meet their more modest fiscal target these budgets would need to be cut by more than 15% after 2015-16. Labour would need to implement cuts of just 3%.    

All of this of course points to another big difference. If Labour is spending more – and if it doesn’t raise taxes – it will be borrowing more and perhaps more importantly presiding over a greater burden of debt. The effect of this might be relatively modest in the short term, but borrowing as much as their rule would allow beyond 2020 would mean national debt around £170 billion higher (in today’s terms) by the end of the 2020s than would be achieved through a balanced budget. So even if Labour do keep spending cuts to a minimum over the next parliament, further tax increases or spending cuts might prove necessary down the line in order to reduce risks with the long term state of the public finances further. The problem is that another recession will strike one day. Going in to a new recession with debt still high – and it’s higher now than at any time since the late 1960s could leave less room for manoeuvre. The sort of additional borrowing that we were able to support as we made our way through the recent period might not be as easily financed.    

So the choices are pretty stark. The Conservatives offer some more dramatic spending cuts, which may not prove easy to deliver. Under their plans we are not even half way through the cuts. Labour offer an easier (but not easy) time for public services, but probably more risk with the public finances. One thing they do have in common is an unwillingness to discuss the third leg of the fiscal stool – taxes. But don’t let it be said that the two main parties offer no choice at this election. These are real, meaty political choices.",null,0,null,1421594404,null,0,false,0,cnstnyb,null,t3_2su2d4,null,t1_cnstnyb,null,t3_2su2d4,null,null,null,1424810848,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"As I alluded to above, my view is that landlords need to be taxed more to stop this behavior. It probably **will** push prices up in the mid-long term, but that might not be a bad thing... tenants would be paying for a very different sort of package and could vote for the best landlords with their wallets as is the case in other countries. They'd be paying more but for a property that was more ""theirs"" in the sense they could modify it (within reason), do what they want with it (i.e. have children, pets or whatever) with longer and more secure tenancies.

It strikes me that right now tenants get the worst of both deals; they are forced to live a life their landlord can dictate (and ""landlords"" as a social class can dictate to them)... and the same time they are paying down that landlords mortgage.... another way to look at it is like this; For the last 10 years I've rented. I've never missed one-months payment. The approximately £400-500 a month I've been paying every month now amounts to £48,000 i've paid in rent over a decade. That could have been £48K I'd paid off my own mortgage... but I couldn't, because on paper my creditworthiness is less than the landlords. So effectively the only difference between the landlord and I at the start of the arrangement was that they were able to come up with a modest deposit or, as was often the case with 105% mortgages - simply have the inherent creditworthiness at a time of cheap credit.

I see this happening in two ways;

* Either a straight up increase to the capital gains tax landlords pay (and infact at the moment it seems from data available that many landlords simply aren't declaring their rental properties for capital gains and are effectively committing tax fraud). The alternative would be a more fundamental change to the way rental property is taxed... with some new tax that effectively takes the place of a capital gains tax.

* Income tax; most landlords at the moment aim to pay their mortgage with their tenants and then make a profit on top called a ""yield"". A good yield is considered to be about 2-10% per month. I suspect income tax avoidance on second properties is rife, but more so I wonder if the rate could be increased or again simply transferred into some new rental-property tax.",null,0,null,1421594634,null,0,1421594874,0,cnstquk,null,t3_2sqzfi,null,t1_cnstquk,null,t1_cnstckt,null,null,null,1424810810,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The truth about getting angry is that it doesn't remove pent up aggression but actually increases it.
So all this ""lets make you angry hour TV"" shit is doing - aside from being a massive distraction - is making people more and more angry.

I personally hold the producers of these shows responsible for this increased alienation and, as a consequence, believe next weeks show should have the segment *""Should we bring back torture for the producers of media that seeks to capitalise on increased anger and alienation?""*
The question is deliberately phrased as to build in an assumption - that TV producers need to be punished for some crimes - we will not allow this assumption to be challenged in the debate slot and whenever anyone tries to challenge said assumption we will treat them like they are less than a rodent for trying to ask *the right questions* instead of *the big questions*.

For example - *Do people on benefits suck society dry?* assumes that any change in the benefit system has the potential to actually improve the average persons life in any way shape or form. Makes people very angry though.

* The TV-debates actually do Miliband a favour... his awkward clumsiness is downplayed in a debating environment where he is more comfortable (after all like all Private school/Oxbridge types he's been debating since he was old enough to talk and will have been tutored at school, university and at work in how to do it effectively). The debates could come off more like PMQs with both Cameron and Miliband laying some broadsides on each other. If the electorate suddenly decide he isn't so personally objectionable we could see a huge surge in Labour support.

* UKIP eat heavily into the Tories across the country. Although labour get hurt too it isn't as bad as expected. Also, the Greens do well (as now expected) in some areas, but this mostly comes at the expense of the LDs and fails to gain them any seats or bargaining power. 

Labour are then able to cross the finish line with a small majority. The flip side;

* The NHS crisis deepens and the economy continues to improve.

* George Osborne uses the March 18th budget as a conservative pre-election giveaway to middle-England. For example, increasing the threshold for the 40% tax rate to above £50,000 pa, scrapping some green taxes and a few curve-balls (like they did at the last budget with pensions) with a promise to do more if elected. Labour are forced to come out against this which hurts their metropolitan-elite vote.

* Miliband makes a series of personal blunders or perhaps a closely-related scandal drops which he handles badly. These would both play into Tory hands and paint Miliband as an incompetent and clumsy man, not suitable to lead the country. 

* The UKIP vote shrinks closer to the election and is more evenly distributed than had been anticipated, taking relatively equal shares from both the Tories and labor. 

-----

I continue to predict that one party will probably secure either a small majority or we'll be seeing another election further down the line. A LD:Lab or LD:Tory supply and demand government is also a possibility. I highly doubt we'll see the SNP in any coalition or S&amp;D arrangement at Westminster...

---

&gt;The __Twenty-seventh Amendment__ of the [Constitution of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ireland) provided that children born on the island of Ireland to parents who were both non-nationals would no longer have a constitutional right to citizenship of the [Republic of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland).  It was effected by the __Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Act, 2004__, which was approved by [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum) on 11 June 2004 and signed into law on 24 June of the same year.  It partially reversed changes made to the Constitution by the [Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteenth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland) which was passed as part of the [Good Friday Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement).

I was so sure you would try to bring up that analogy that I was tempted to rebutt it in advance in my original comment. I gave you the benefit of the doubt and you let me down.

You cannot compare the two because right now vehicles are essential for our way of life. We need to be able to get from a to b, our entire economy relies on it. Electric vehicles are, right now, not a suitable substitute (although we're getting there) and mass transport fails when you actually need to transport something.

Vehicles benefit everyone, they allow doctors to get to work to treat us, they allow food to get to stores to keep us alive. We *cannot* ban them.

On the other hand, you lighting up next to me benefits no one but yourself. They are not comparible.

Eventually vehicles emitting toxic fumes will be banned, once the alternatives are good enough. We already have limits placed on emissions and mandatory air quality levels for cities with fines for missing them.

What They (with a capital 'T') really want is to go back to the pre-Snowdon days when everyone thought they were secure, but actually They could read everything via flawed implementations of protocols and snooping on Google's data-centres.

If all communication were out in the open, then surprisingly ""the terrorists"" would stop using electronic communication entirely; as would the other groups who've fallen foul of the NSA over the years (see the case for commercial espionage against Airbus as an example).  And that wouldn't do anyone any good because it would be even more difficult to monitor the really dangerous people.

Cameron's posturing is a smoke-screen.  But I do expect new legislation on the topic, but it will be amazingly vague in the modern tradition of ""make everything illegal, then selectively prosecute"".  It won't say encryption is illegal, it won't even mandate key escrow, instead it'll stack up criminal penalties against anyone who supplies, possesses or facilitates the use of tools that hamper police investigations.

So for example a bank will be off-the-hook, as will most websites using HTTPS, because the police if they approach those organisations will be given the data instantly anyway.

Oh the hook will be everyone else.  The law could be used to strong-arm Apple to take down Snapchat/WhatsApp.  It could be used against ISPs to block services that can't be backdoored.

See the current laws concerning 'hacking tools' as an example of this: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/48/section/37  The anti-encryption laws will follow this model, it won't be illegal to use encryption, it'll be illegal to use it for the purposes of evading or compromising police or security services.

My degree (Including masters, which is essentially mandatory to get a job in my specific field) was around 10,000 hours and I won't be fully qualified until I have done around another 8000+ hours. Add onto that that it has some of the highest entry requirements and the highest dropout rate of any field, higher than medicine and law, which have protected titles.

Additionally there is evidence to suggest that the growing culture of not recognising the importance of engineers is leading to fees for engineers being reduced, which is leading to engineering becoming a less attractive career. Many engineers move abroad, including many if the best and brightest, particularly in electronic Eng, where that get snapped up by google, Facebook, Microsoft et al. Honestly, moving is something I'm likely to do once I'm fully qualified because my fiancee is an Aussie, so a move would be fairly easy. Even I took a pay cut down to almost a graduate level when I moved, it would potentially be a net increase because engineers are paid so much better there.

null,false,nozpz,null,null,null,"I currently use Club Lloyds, TSB and the Nationwide FlexDirect (5% up to £2500 for 12 months, £1000/mo req) for my savings. As long as you read the conditions carefully, you get your interest as promised. Be especially wary of TSB's ""electronic correspondence"" requirement and other things.

The £1500/month threshold can be met with just £1 deposited and withdrawn 1500 times if you want, so it is easy to get around (it does not actually have to be a salary).

I opened two TSB accounts when you were allowed to do that, so I just have a £500 standing order for each TSB account into the Nationwide and back again, and then my salary handles the Club Lloyds one. If I ever max out Club Lloyds then I'll open a Santander one.

Additionally look into the switching bonus offers right now: Clydesdale Bank give you £150, First Direct Gives you £100, Halifax gives you £100, co-operative gives you £100. Some need some direct debits to switch over as well. I started off with a dummy bank account that I opened purely to be switched to Co-operative, then I just keep switching whenever I get the bonus. You usually need a minimum deposit within the first month, but again it can be the same money transferred multiple times.

Now as to whether that should be extended to smoking in pubs, well as I mentioned in another post this is a nuance of interventionist health policy. Some rules get put in place ""for our own good"" like a ban on leaded petrol. Smoking ban was deemed to be similar.

null,false,TeaDependant,null,null,null,"I'm a little late to the thread, but if you're interested in how banks work interest out then this is how it's done. It's usually calculated on the assumption of a 366 days in a year for ease of calculation, so the percentage is across those 366 days. Just to give you an example of how this is calculated we'll look at 3k sat in the account at 3% during Jan:

£3,000.00 * 1.03 = £3,090.00

Annual interest is therefore £90.

Work this out daily, so £90/366 = £0.24590164

Then apply this to the billing period. In Jan there's 31 days, so

£0.24590164 x 31 = £7.62 Gross.

Then take away the tax, currently 20% which leaves you just short of £6.10 

This, of course, depends on billing periods, actual funds in the account, and compound interest when looking at more than one billing period. 

Source: I work in the financial sector, this is how my training has always insisted it be calculated. 

Please note anyone with outstanding CC borrowing, loans, and so forth, I would look into minimising those before looking to something like the Santander123 account to see if you can save by reducing outgoings rather than increasing income. Unless, of course, you're just gaming their system to reap the rewards.

Also be aware of their overdraft useage costs, if you have an agreed overdraft facility there's a charge on the account of £1/day. That may sound great, but in reality even £1k at 19.9% is only costing you 55 pence a day. It's an account that has the potential to earn you money if you make sure it's kept in credit and run efficiently, but you should use it as a bonus and not become reliant on skipping the usual shopping-around of utilities, debt reduction and using CCs for rewards and cashback.

Also, you bring out the Spurs game. We weren't even that good there. It was a scrappy game from us in the first half, very sloppy in possession. Spurs were incredibly bad, couldn't take advantage of our bad plays. Luckily we killed the game off with a very soft penalty and a goal from Moreno. I wouldn't have banked on us getting all 3 from there at half time. That penalty helped us. It was a lucky big win, nothing like the benchmark performance last year.

&gt; Recently we've been playing without Sturridge or Suarez and yet it turns out the team is still quite capable of scoring. I really don't see that it had anything to do with new players at all, it was simply instructions given by Rodgers to the team.

Had you moved to Scotland 'in a heartbeat' on independence you'd have been amazed at all the traffic going in the opposite direction.

The SNP lied.  They lied about the currency and they lied about the advice they'd received from Europe.  Independence would have meant cuts.  Far worse than anything Osborne or Thatcher ever did.  A currency union without close political union was never on the table - that's the whole lesson the Eurozone has learned.  That means Scotland would have had to peg to pound like countries peg to the dollar, only to do that in a stable fashion to compensate for not having BoE controls requires running not a deficit but a surplus.

The next Scottish government, the first independent one, regardless of who it was or who was calling the shots, would have had to cut services to the bone to keep the competitive tax cuts Salmond had had to promise.

Yes, that's *exactly* what they're saying. Because by its very nature, encrypted traffic is opaque. Therefore, they can't ban only encrypted chat traffic. They have to ban *all* encrypted traffic. The best they can hope to do is pressure the makers of the major chat applications to give them a backdoor.

They're both globally used applications and losing out on revenue from UK users will be an annoyance rather than a dealbreaker.

It's unlikely to change in the United Kingdom so your best bet is to move. Australia would surely be a wise choice although the cost of living is high out there, so the good salaries are simply relative. A friend of mine (mechanic) earns $100k AUD/year but says he hasn't saved much at all.    

I got my BEng in 2011, but didn't secure work immediately so have had to go to menial jobs (from 2014), working with people who can't read or write in English. The funniest thing is I actually earned more from 2012-2013 than most of my fellow graduates who secured work immediately in Engineering. Some of those are now turning away from it due to low salaries and not being in a job that allows them to fulfill their potential. They see the senior guys only earning £40k after a lifetime of work and realise that it's not a great trade-off at all.    

I earned about £58,000 gross before tax during those two years, some of the guys who went straight into work only earned around £40,000 by comparison. In 2014 my salary dropped to £22,000 a year but I only worked 182 days (4 on 4 off).

-Aguero shouldn't have started, he's clearly not up to his usual self and would've been better to bring him on late rather than force him on.

-Milner was poor, with us missing nasri and Yaya, we were left with no creativity unless the ball was at silva's feet. This game was much more suited for Jovetic, which is why when he came in I think we turned on the jets. 

-Navas was shit, predictable, and useless. Constant deflected crosses with no end result. 

- our set pieces need some serious fucking work. 16(?) corners and our best result was a header from kompany not even on target. 

- fernandinho should've stayed on over Fernando, he adds more going up the pitch.

Kompany - worst game i have ever seen him play. should have been sent off, he deserves a game rating less than his number. had a couple of good moments in last second defending, but that does not make up for this. 3

Demi - also poor, kept passing to Arsenal, did better than kompany but that is not saying much. 4

Fernands - Not terrible on D, not terrible on O. but you can see how much we miss yaya now. 5s for the both.

Milner - didn't have any impact on the game, very disappointed by him today. he was shut down by the great D and then called off. ill be kind, 5

navas - great pace, terrible crosses. i dont want to knw how many crosses he had, they were almost all (except 1) shit. played very 1 dimensional, refused to cut inside, or even acknowledge that AGUERO ISNT AN AERIEL THREAT. 4

Silva - Similar to zabby, did well with what he was given, but just got outmuscled. i feel that in these games (physical) he needs to stay on the wings so he can cut in, but that works best when nasri is there also. 7

Kun - no help at all. similar to milner i had to remind myself he was even on the field. He needs a strike partner for now, until he gets back into form at the least. 6

* Using a signing certificate from one of the well-known CAs, produce fake certificates for any web site that the user is going to. The web browser will negotiate a secure connection to the browser.
* Set up a second secure session from the proxy to the web server.
* Block any content you can't decrypt.

As a user, you would be able to detect this quite easily with things like certificate pinning. That doesn't matter, since they are not trying to conceal their interception. They will be quite happy to block any traffic  that they can't read.

Whether it's any use for burglaries probably depends on how many expensive portable items you have - think laptops, tablets, games consoles, cameras, smaller TVs, etc - and jewelery. Assume most of that gets taken; look at the premium and excess and decide for yourself if it's worth it.

Remember that insurance doesn't necessarily replace new for old, but also remember that it can provide some other useful cover, like legal expenses, and bike theft.

If you're a single person in a flat, possibly it's not worth it.

Either way, I would always go with a bigger insurer who you've at least heard of before you looked at the price comparison sites - and check the coverage to see that it has everything you need.

Is it though that's the question.  The reason you can't take a 50cc moped on the motorway (or a restricted 125cc) is that it can't go fast enough to obtain motorway speeds.  

People on L plates can't go on a motorway either as they don't have the experience or confidence to deal with driving at speed in heavy traffic.

&gt; cars can't go fast enough.

But we do issue points when that's the case. 

Ooops.  I think I broke your argument in to all these tiny pieces.  Puttering along a motorway at 40mph should be considered Dangerous Driving, because it is to every other user of it.  Considering it's the old who seem more happy to plant a car at 40mph regardless of speed limit, road conditions or whatever either it's yearly testing to make sure they're skills are still up to the level required OR we just keep banging out the penalty points until they loose their license that way.

3) Why is it unlikely that Farage would speak to underage people about smoking and drinking? I believe that he was responding to a question from the audience. Gay sex orgies were not the subject of his talk.

I'm more than ok not going back to that. We need an out and out winger and Navas showed last year he's good at it and creates a shit load of goals if we actually have someone to get on the end of crosses. 

Today arsenal packed the box full of defenders. What's he supposed to do? Hit a cross in the air to Aguero or Silva? Go back into the middle which is packed? Or just try and thread a miracle ball through all those bodies. 

He did the latter because he had no other options and yeah most of them hit defenders. Pellegrini should have changed things ups or subbed him because it was clear Wenger had planned for it.  

If we sell him, it'll be to get another proper winger. Maybe a more creative one, but it won't be to facilitate Milner and Nasri starting next to Silva.

With Chelsea and, for the moment, Manchester City are out of reach above, and Swansea and those below them slipping and struggling in the middle, from Saints at third down to Liverpool at 8th, there's six clubs fighting for Europe and the top end of the Premiership prize money. Check out this league of six after 22 games: 

Southampton         42 
Manchester United  40
Arsenal                  39
Tottenham             37
West Ham              36
Liverpool                35

Looking at this league over the next 5 games, I've looked for matches between these teams (when they can take points away from each other) and those above and below. I've scored inter league matches as a difficulty of one, those above as 1.5 and those below at 0, in the interests of ranking the league members next five matches by difficulty/likelihood of losing points. I'll put a [pic up of my calculations](http://imgur.com/s6Lizgw).

Man U and Arsenal have a nice draw, then Saints, and the bottom three have a nasty run over the next month or so. West Ham have it the worst.... 

Can anyone else see this mini league emerging for the next phase of the season?

It's laughable that at 6,000 capacity they couldn't force the home fans up a bit and accommodate those left out. At the end of the day those outside were justifiably upset and that could have been prevented.
