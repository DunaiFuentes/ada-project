Yes, but make sure you are prepared. A letter delivered in person and then a meeting based on the contents is much better than going there and ranting at them. (Not suggesting that you would of course)

&gt;Also the reimbursement that I have been offered so far has been either in the form of a deduction on my next months rent, or a cash in hand payment - are either of these acceptable and are they my only options?

I don't know that there are any limitations on how you are reimbursed, it depends what you are willing to accept and feel you can justify if you need to in future. Personally I would push to be paid by cheque or bank transfer, cash is iffy sometimes and you have a better paper trail with cheque/transfer. 

If you don't know yet whether you'll be paying next month's rent, then cash is better than nothing. I personally wouldn't ever accept a deduction from something I don't know if I'll be paying at all. 

Not that it really matters if you end up taking legal action - the deduction will be treated as a refund, and if it is decided that you were not liable to pay rent for the period, you should be able to get the amount of the deduction paid to you.

null,false,AnalyticContinuation,null,null,null,"Well - yes - ""making book"" is the art of trying to get the odds so that you come out on top no matter what the outcome.

But it is interesting that you link to ""Betfair"" because of course they pioneered a different model where the customers can take either side of the bet. So everyone can play at 'making book' and Betfair just take a commission on top.

However your advice is sound. When betting assume that you are going to lose in the long run, unless you have the statistics skills necessary to be able to compute your expected return and you can back up your conclusions.

On a similar mathematical note, the truly **addictive** bets have high ""variance"" (in stats terms) and a small built-in negative expectation. The human mind gets very excited by the high variance and doesn't see the small negative trend which slowly takes all their money.

If this jargon makes no sense to you here is the equivalent using casino odds: you bet on red and it pays 2 if you win, 0 if you lose. The odds are nearly 50%, but slightly worse because you don't win if green 0 comes up. But the variance (getting 0 or 2) hides the very slight bias against you and **you will win almost 50% of the time** (which will feel great.) So you bet and feel good even as your stash slowly depletes.

Now it is always a good idea to try to reduce the variance in the outcome when gambling (or even when investing!) so consider this bet instead: you bet on red **and** black each spin. This will almost always cost 2 and pay out 2, because one colour will win and one will lose (and both lose only when green comes up.) The variance is the smallest you can get at the roulette table, so in some sense it is the ""best"" bet to make. But you might argue ""with this bet I usually come out even and occasionally I lose. How is that better? I never win."" The answer is that you are losing at *exactly* the same average (mean) rate as previously. But now you have smoothed out the variation completely.

There are a number of exciting prospects in the squad though, and if you want to watch a team mature, I like to think this Spurs group is on the rise.  Of our current ""Best XI""  Only Lloris, Vertonghen, and Fazio are regular starters over the age of 25.  Poch and his team have a history playing/promoting youth, so with a team this young, there is reason to be optimistic.  In fact, other than goalkeeper, we have a first team player 25 or under in every position (replace Vert and Fazio with Dier and Chiriches).

Ultimately, we're at a crossroads.  We've got some of the old regime that needs to move on and we need the next crop of youngsters to develop.  This winter and summer transfer period is important IMHO to see how the board reacts going forward.  If we sign someone like Carlos Bacca (rumored today) then I'm not sure what I'll think, but if we shift some dead weight and pick up some younger talent (Ings), then we may be buying in completely to this youth revitalization.

Elon Musk (Blessed Be His Name) won't be able to overcome these problems for decades either, no matter how much venture capital and fawning media hype he attracts. 

Geography is not nearly as much of a factor as you're trying to make out. Japan is very much an oddball in these terms, and even so, there is easily enough available space for them to get at least a significant fraction of their energy needs from solar. You'll recall that I said that the world's energy needs could be met with solar covering a grand total of 2% of the world's deserts. Not Earth's surface area. Not its land surface area. Its deserts. There is no *requirement* to make the substantial investment in space solar when the same money could pay for a vastly larger coverage of area on the ground. Germany can already supply about 50% of its electricity via renewables on a good day, and looks likely to go entirely renewable in the foreseeable future. Energy costs more per kWh there, but not unreasonably so, and if the cost of solar keeps dropping at anywhere near its current rate, Germany will probably even make a saving in the long run. All with ground-based power; no space-borne white elephants at all. Nearly all developed nations, and quite a lot of developing ones, could do the same easily enough - especially if everyone agreed to get the hell on with it. The reason they don't do that? Economics and politics. More the latter, if anything. 

You really ought to take the threat of climate change to civilisation (and its accumulated knowledge base) quite seriously. Those notoriously hysterical longhairs at the US Department of Defense do. Essentially every scientist in the most relevant fields does. Get with the program. There's no excuse any more. 

Look, I'm as much a fan of space exploration and cool technology as you are. Possibly more, if anything. Space travel is going to be an indispensible part of humanity's future, if we as a civilisation survive long enough. But space solar isn't going to be worth pursuing for a long time yet, and the effort and resources required to roll it out on any significant scale would be far better spent on building sustainable infrastructure down here.

The season we qualified for the CL Huddlestone played the most games (along with Palacios) of the entire squad (40+). He was also #1 in league games played (Defoe and Crocuh had more games in total, but a good chunk of theirs were substitutions). 

It is just difficult to imagine someone that watched that season would 
claim Huddlestone wasn't good enough at the top-level (he never seemed the same post his injury though).

Bentley had some decent games in that season, but he only played 15 games (A substantial amount of which were subs too).

Darrent Bent also moved to Sunderland the season we made it to the CL. I don't even think he played a single game that season.

Furthermore, Modric was injured for a good chunk of that season. That is the sole reason Niko came in. Even Ledley King managed to rack up as many games as Modric.

I don't mind engaging with you on integration but I'm not going to get into debunking conspiracy theories as I might as well try to convince a religious zealot that God doesn't exist for all the goods the evidence will do.

&gt; They have to speak English, they can't wear what they like, they don't want to act like us, they are all illegal immigrants and women-haters and taking over parts of Britain. The far right is gaining popularity solely because the gutter press has done its job.

Okay, I'll debunk just this little bit as you've posted it specifically. Many Muslims can and have integrated successfully. They work alongside non-Muslims, have non-Muslim friends and contribute towards inter-communal relations. These people are very different from those who do not associate with non-Muslims, do not make efforts to integrate into wider society and are hostile to those outside of their in-group (frequently hostile to other Muslims too). 

This latter group may indeed be targeted in the gutter press but pretending that they do not exist and that all Muslims are the former group ignores the problem of this latter group and too many people are aware of this latter group for the politically correct narrative to be effective in disguising the truth.",null,0,null,1421098161,null,0,false,0,cnmv2yz,null,t3_2s6f8a,null,t1_cnmv2yz,null,t1_cnmu44u,null,null,null,1424914025,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Parents both went to University in Swansea, Dad (English but never had a club ((he watched Spurs, Southampton and Plymouth as a kid) as moved around a lot with pilot grandfather) watched the Swans from Division 4 in the mid 70s, saw them rocket up the league and come crashing down. Mam's sport was badminton but she loves her rugby and football so has also been an avid Swans fan since then. Growing up I remember watching Soccer Saturday, remember the Swans letting last minute goals in against the great and good of the football league.


I always supported the Swans as the family team, always wanted them to do well but living in South East England and never going to watch football (i was always either playing it or playing other sport) but my boyhood team was Liverpool (as a lad this was due to my adoration for Michael Owen).


I will always wish Liverpool well, but when I got older and the Swans got better I really did buy into it from a distance with my parents. I remember how exciting that last day was against Hull, how much relief mam and dad felt. And then on from there with the Martinez days, that was truly a great few seasons. 


I remember us bossing that league, with the likes of Leeds (remember their points deduction too!) and Nottingham Forest beneath us. To be topping such giants was amazing, and then that first season in the Championship. I remember us all being convinced that we would not be able to cut it in the Championship and then all of a sudden we just did (beating Forest 3-1 I remember). 


I remember how disappointing it was losing Martinez (something I would have to learn to accept again and again the more I watched the Swans) and then how gutting it was on the last day to not be able to beat fucking Doncaster (poor poor Lee). 


And then moving here in 2010 for uni too, I remember thinking how incredible following a team live was. I'd played football all my life, I'd watched it on tele all my life, but I'd only ever seen one MK Dons game and one Man United game (friend had a free ticket YOLO), so it really was a profoundly new experience for me. My first game was QPR at home, it finished 0-0 of course with David Cotterill missing a pen. I didn't get to see any further games as a fresher until Sheffield United at the end of the season, this can be put down to some babe who kindly let me put my penis in her. When this highly romantic episode was put to bed I found love again in the Swans. 

That night against Nottingham Forest... I will never forget. What. A. Game. That Pratley goal, Britt's goal, the drama, Earnshaw... And then of course Wembley. Watching that game with my Dad was something I will never forget.

From then on, I've learnt how fantastic away days with mates can be, how much joy there is in travelling hundreds of miles to watch your team. I've learnt to meet triumph and disaster and treat those two impostors just the same. I've seen pitiful defeats at West Ham, at Stoke, at Cardiff... and I've seen us win at Anfield, The Emirates and Old Trafford.

Why do you generalize and misrepresent the other side? It's a really poor, fallacious argument (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man). All I have said on the matter is that i prefer him to the aforementioned players. This, in your eyes, makes me a ""fanboy""? If so, that is just plain ridiculous. 

I don't see how he fits into our style and I think the ""no risk"" narrative that many were spinning when we signed him has been proved completely false. However, I do not see how anyone could argue Borini or Lambert are better players than Balotelli. Just look at their respective experience and accolades; this isn't a great argument for comparing top players but the fact Balotelli has played at the top level in different leagues and on the international stage and enjoyed relative success in doing so certainly gives an indication of the quality gap. Or look at their respective values in the transfer market for another clue. Again, this is not foolproof since obviously we see clubs overpaying in a distorted market but it does provide some indication of how the players are valued by other *professional*, informed 'footballing people', especially if you account for potentially distortionary effects - which, by the way, are likely to have *decreased*, not increased, Balotelli's market value since his reputation has managers wary of his potential impact on team chemistry and the owner of his impact on club PR; if Balotelli was assigned a market value just based on his perceived footballing ability within the game then it would surely be higher. I make these imperfect but simultaneously relevant and poignant arguments because they are factual and objective. My opinion on the matter is derived from what I've seen from the players and I truly can't see how you've come to the conclusion you have but acknowledge that we will get nowhere if I make my argument from this subjective angle.  

I'm curious now, have you honestly watched Balotelli before this season? Before a season where he has been made the scapegoat despite the obvious shortcomings of the team during that period and in which he has been badly so poorly utilized by Rodgers. To hold the view that you do, I seriously doubt that you have. This, of course, is conjecture but what *isn't* based on conjecture is the feeling that you come across as very  naive and petulant with your ""stop it"", your ""seriously sick of this now"", and your total misrepresentation of both myself and the counter argument.

&gt;

&gt;A __straw man__ is a common type of [argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_argument) and is an [informal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy) based on the misrepresentation of an opponent's argument.  To be successful, a straw man argument requires that the audience be ignorant or uninformed of the original argument.

&gt;The so-called typical ""attacking a straw man"" argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition by covertly replacing it with a different proposition (i.e., ""stand up a straw man"") and then to refute or defeat that false argument (""knock down a straw man"") instead of the original proposition.  

&gt;This technique has been used throughout history in [polemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polemic) debate, particularly in arguments about highly charged emotional issues where a fiery, entertaining ""battle"" and the defeat of an ""enemy"" may be more valued than [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking) or understanding both sides of the issue.

2008-09 was a disastrous season when we had 2 points in November. We fired Ramos, got Redknapp (for good and for bad). But, why would I claim that was the best season since Gazza played here?

But this is what I am talking about. You got strong opinions but little evidence. 

If you can't remember what season we made it to the CL or won the League Cup, you probably shouldn't be so bombastic about who performed well or not a season 10 years ago.

You literally argued that Woodgate was one of two dominant players in the campaign we qualified for the CL. But he played one full game that season. Similarly, you claim Modric dominated the midfield that season, while it was Kranjcar that shone as the replacement of Modric. In particular in the home game against City. 

Then you also claim Modric was dominant in the League Cup win, even though he was still living in Croatia at the time...

So how can I not assume that your opinions are rooted in somewhat loose evidence? If your grasp on the two most important seasons in the last decade is this loose, why should I take your opinion about the 2005-06 season any more seriously?

EDIT: I looked up ""KinGate"" as I can't really trust your claims to fact anymore...in the LC winning season they only played 27 games combined between the two of them out of 53 games in total (Woodgate 17 and King 10). 

EDIT II: Combined they played four games in the LC.

Over the last few years the Government promised new milk markets in Russia and China. Many farmers took loans to improve the farms ready to provide for these markets. Then they collapsed. Russia banned EU dairy imports and the Chinese market hasn't developed like it was expected too as the Chinese developed a home industry rather then relying on imports.

Edit: just realized you've said they have signed, sorry. I'm not 100% on this but there may be a very short period (ie 24 - 72 hours) where they can nullify the contract. I would strongly advise they contact the property ombudsman and find out what they can do. 

Edit 2: I've seen elsewhere you've said they've threatened to void the contract if they don't pay by today (that is HIGHLY unorthodox given their move in date of feb 2). Maybe just letting them void the contract would be the best option? They don't have real grounds, so your friends wouldn't be liable to pay the fee.

Chicago is the closest professional/semi-professional club, but still 2 hours by car.  Swansea has sponsored the youth club that I played for since the Championship days.  (I think there was a post about it in the subreddit during the summer when Garry and some players stopped by at the North Shore camp). A director from the academy is actually here right now.  It's a little odd to be supporting a club from 4000 miles away, but Swansea is popular in the community and has become our adopted local team in a way.

Agreed. I've worked in pubs for a few years and it's amazing how many people I would see become addicted to fruit machines and completely forget about their losses with every jackpot.

I've seen people spunk £100 into a £25 machine and walk away happy when they finally ""won the jackpot"".

My one saving grace in all the time I gambled on fruit machines was my patience. I used to watch people fill them up all day and could usually tell when they were ready for paying out. But I always quit when I was ahead, and stopped playing altogether when I stopped working in pubs around the same time the jackpots started going up, and the machines started requiring more going in to get even small wins.

**What's the Welsh view on American fans?**

No problem with them, as long as they aren't pandered to. I'm a firm believer that anyone who starts supporting the Swans should fit into the culture of the club, rather than try to force it round to their idea of what the club should be. It's hard to explain this point properly or cite major examples of it in action... but it would include the stuff you see at some of the bigger clubs where you see fans from abroad dump on their stadium supporters for voicing discontent, for example American Arsenal fans telling London Arsenal fans they're an embarrassment to the club for wanting Wenger out (I don't agree Wenger deserves criticism but it's not my club to pass judgement).

I see it a lot like visiting somewhere on holiday basically - just because I'm there and from somewhere else, doesn't mean I can start flouting local laws and upsetting everyone by jaywalking, getting drunk and disorderly in public or complaining that the locals are boring.

Basically, if you support the Swans because you wan't to be one of us then you're entirely welcome in my eyes and pretty much anyone else's. Just don't tell me I should be grateful for the price of a ticket when compared to the NFL or that you think singing about Cardiff is petty and childish! Those of you who respect us as a regional club are more than welcome and you can even bring your own flag if you want.

**How do you feel about the potential of American ownership?**

I know some people want 'investment', but get the fuck out with that shit if you ask me. We aren't sustainably going to go any higher than we are now and we've got to where we are through our excellent model. I don't want some career sports businessman to get up to his bullshit and spit out out when he's done. I take pride in the fact we look out for ourselves.

Incorrect. Counterexample: Team1 and Team2 equal odds of winning statistically from historic data. 10 million is bet on Team1 and only 1 million on Team2, resulting in a large loss for the betting company if Team1 wins. This risk for loss has to be factored into odds in order to maintain profit margins.

I'd agree with that, a lot of the time you see odds that are awful based on current form but people still bet on it because they just look at the name and think 'they're good, let's bet on them'. Typically it is when a smaller team is playing a big team, even if the big team is doing poorly at the moment their odds will be widely in their favour because bookies know the majority of the public won't look at form and so will bet on them anyway because they are a big name. A good example is England in the world cup where you might get us at 12/1 to win the world cup whereas if you placed a bet in Spain it might be 20/1 because English bookies know a lot of patriotic people are going to bet against the logical outcome and so have to compensate for that.

During the match, it looked like the same thing was happening all over again. That was until Wayne Bridge scored that beauty. And i lost it. It was madness. Our fans at the stadiums were by far better than Arsenal. All throughout the match, it was Chelsea fans who were singing and that lifted our players. I barely slept that night and the next morning my throat was sore because of all the screaming and yelling. At that night, i saw some Chelsea fans crying after the match. Just imagine seeing fans going crazy for a quarter final match. It was a big deal knocking Arsenal out of the UCL. That loss also ended their unbeaten run. For me getting knocked out in the Semi-finals wasn't even that painful. We came so close to booking our tickets to the finals and we would have met young Jose. But, the match against Arsenal was extra significant to me because most of my family members are  Arsenal supporters. Losing to Arsenal would have been really painful.

I don't know a lot about Macs from an ownership perspective but your typical business PC will have a 3 year on-site warranty. I don't want to sound overly negative, but if you have been in business for a while (perhaps almost 3 years?) and haven't yet made enough over living expenses to cover a new machine, then you really have to consider carefully if this is really a business, or a hobby that produces some income. It's one thing to have a growth phase before making money, but if you're already outliving your computer before doing so then that's a concern.

This matters, because if it's really a business then it *may* make sense to buy a new machine on credit - if you have a realistic expectation of it making you money. But if it's a hobby that isn't actually paying for itself, then I'd suggest you probably shouldn't borrow to fund it.

A couple of other thoughts:

I won't tell you to get something other than a Mac because Macs are expensive (though, frankly, they are), because graphics people prefer Macs and for all I know there are excellent reasons for that (plus you probably have some expensive software you want to transfer over to a new machine), but does it need to be a laptop? Could you get a desktop Mac (pre-owned?) for the actual illustration work and use a generic cheap/near-free laptop for everything else? (Preferably a desktop with a case you can open and replace bits in, if Apple still make those.) Don't think about what's beautiful and perfect for the job, think what will get the job done.

Why not calculate a rent level and pay your parents back once you get a job. Sometimes you need to take the help you're handed. 

Personally I had no faith that the government would find me a job. That's just not how I think. If I wanted a job I needed to go out and get one myself. The state wasn't going to do jack shit. And I was well capable of doing so.

Most economists are starting to question the current narrative along with the bond markets.  You only have to look at bond yields to notice a massive trend which is prices going lower and lower.  Normally lower borrowing rates means lower returns in the future, low growth and investors want you to borrow.  Given how bond yields have been getting lower over the last couple of years we only just bounced back in terms of GDP not even on trend compared to past recessions. 

Economists are starting to question the whole idea behind austerity study was disproven after it was found to have a maths error in it.  IMF did a paper or two proving that austerity has reduced growth rates, couple other think tanks followed up.  Been one or two papers on house booms causing massive recessions. 

From what I know about economics the current thinking is based on the idea that supply side reform is enough and that demand is not a problem.  Gov spending has forced away demand from private companies with taxing companies being a bad thing. 
Lets say I don't agree with the current thinking and most economists are starting to disagree.  Given how this has been the longest period of decline we had in over 600 years.

My advice - just use the credit card for this one purchase and never again. These credit cards are profitable because they take advantage of poor fools we see the money as theirs, and up screwing their futures. Don't be misled.

Maybe Jovetic is a good foil for a Dzeko or Bony, rather than someone else who has the kind of movement that Aguero has.

We seem to play very well against the top sides and pick up some great results like being the first side to beat Eastleigh at their ground this year. It's just a shame that we really struggle against the lower sides for some reason so that's quite frustrating but being 15 points clear of the relegation zone is brilliant so I can't complain!

Damian Reeves is our stand-out player. 3rd top scorer in the league with 13 goals is excellent for a side in 15th, what a legend.

Best Result: Beating Bristol Rovers at home was fun as they're the newly relegated side and a pretty huge club for this level, but the winner all day long goes to our derby match against Macclesfield Town winning 1-0 in the 90th minute after not playing them for almost 15 years. That was just excellent.

I would love to finish top 10 but that is a very ambitious target so I'll be very happy with safety by March and a big trophy run.

It took around an hour they pretty much break down ur situation bit by bit, it's all fairly easy. Then once they have a good idea about ur finances you get out through to a finance advisor who looks at what you can afford to pay per month. Once they do that they offer you a debt management plan, basically by working  out your budget they can then speak to the companies you do have debt with and arrange a payment plan with them which stops the interest and you pay X amount and they share X between the companies you are in debt with. People will say it's not the best thing to do however it's better than defaulting or staying in debt and as each debt gets paid X amount will still be spread around your other debts, and if you were to receive a lump sum of money you can obviously pay towards the debt. 

To be fair even without going down the route I am going in it's good to talk to a professional and break down where your money is going as I found I spend way to much on shit. My actual debt is £2600 if you include my credit card and after looking at my finances it was worked out £240 a month at this current time is what I could afford to pay but still live which is important. I would 100% give them s ring and just pretty much accept your debt situation and get it sorted. People will say get a loan or get a credit card and consolidate your debt but then you are still in debt at least this way your debt is reducing and because your in a debt management plan until it finishes you can't take out any loans etc.. 


The next stages for me is to fill out the paper work of all my credit accounts so all the pay day loans and credit card and overdraft and then they will do the rest and agree a deal with the creditors. 

I'm no expert but if you need any more info give me a shout!

Holtby played on an extremely poor Fulham side last year and was nearly their best player numbers wise even though he was only there 4 months.

Not trying to be a stickler, but really.... Westermann, Jansen, Beister, Adler, Lasogga ... We're talking German internationals on several levels, some with senior caps. Behrami, Holtby, Deikmeyer, Van Der Vaart. They have a strong roster but have performed poorly. That sounds a bit like us at times, I.e. Siggy. The way people are putting it here, it's like he is the reason they're struggling because his numbers are down. Lasogga has been highly regarded coming through the ranks in recent seasons, and this year just isn't producing. Lewis is never going to be a goal getter, and VDV is playing poorly, so where are his assists going to come from? Lasogga has 2 goals in 16 games on 47 shots.... Lewis went from supplying Soldado to someone playing just the same... And we expect him to have 10 assists by now, but assists don't get tallied if people don't bag the goals.... Sorry for the rant. Everyone says Lewis doesn't have the quality, yet is one of the few players who actually has CL experience, and played extremely well in that competition. 

Hamburg forwards 
Lasogga 2 in 16
Rudnevs 1 in  12
All others 0 goals. 

There's your proof for lack of goals. 

VDV is their leading scorer with 3 GOALS!!! 

They've scored 8 goals in 18 games!!!! This is a systematic failure at the club, not players. That's why they fired their coach one month into the season! Now they need to adapt and improve.

I didn't mean to say that I'm right and you're wrong or anything like that. I was just pointing out how it's equally as easy to use sites like iPlayer or Netflix outside the restricted regions (obviously Netflix not everyone can use as its a paid service, I was more speaking to iPlayer, or those redditors that do have an account with Netflix. But everyone's free to use BBC iPlayer, even without commercials. 

Both YouTube and iPlayer are easy to use (you can find the show/episode you'd like with a simple Google search) and all you need is an extension like Zenmate or Chrome and you're done. Many people have these already, so there are no additional steps. And even on YouTube often BBC shows like Top Gear or QI are sometimes region-restricted, requiring the need for those extensions anyway. 

I'm simply writing all this because I've found that so many redditors think that it's a real task to watch unrestricted videos, that you need moderate computer knowledge and that its just easier to watch on YT; some people even think you need a subscription, or that you need to pay for BBC iPlayer.  So I feel the need to point out that it's equally as simple, you do definitely get higher quality (which matters for viewers using large screens/good sound systems to watch; it's definitely noticeable), it's completely commercial free (and we know YT isn't always), and episodes uploaded *immediately* after airing. Plus, I like the idea that if anything I could be supporting my favorite show, rather than watching outside of the BBC's control (they might never know how many people watch their show of everyone watches from some guy's YT account. 

And again, if you disagree, that's fine, but I hope that reading this might educate at least one other redditor as to all the amazing programs you can get through iPlayer.

The difference in playing time and their relative production is marginal, and certainly not enough to say Lambert is clearly better than Balotelli, especially over such a small sample size. Both have scored so few that one goal, which could be down to a shot either took recently that went in through keeper error rather than being saved (De Gea save, for instance), and I could use the exact same argument you just did *for* Balotelli being the better player. With the margins we're dealing with and the sample size we're looking at, it is just plain stupidity to try and claim such a strong conclusion.  

Either way, there is more to the game than goals and assists. Balotelli creates chances for others and himself at a higher rate, holds the ball up better, is more mobile (yes, I mean that), and ultimately can impose himself on a game. I'm yet to see Lambert impose himself in the way Balotelli has after coming off the bench recently.

So lets see how this would pan out.

One in three of us will get cancer, so lets say one of you gets cancer. Your not on the ultra delux private health plan that pays for everything, because thats £800.00 a month each. No your on the one that is about the same as what you currently pay into the nhs - lets say £350.00 a month each, this is a fairly reasonable package. it only covers you for the first  £100,000 of reach ailment, but you get free GP appointments, free A&amp;E visits and contraceptive pills free.

(Note that all these rates are at [NHS rates of 2006.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast/4898158.stm) they would be more now and -EVEN MORE- if set by a private company.)

But now one of you needs chemo, chemo is £40,000.00 per treatment plan.
They also put you on this new cancer killing drug £25,000.00

That's great, the cancer is shrinking, this private hospital stuff is the nuts, you got seen and treated right away... But its not over, to prevent its return you need an operation. Let be conservative again and say £35000.00 to remove whats left and for follow up appointments. Your also on a whole host of pills just to mitigate your treatment and boost your natural immune system, what with you being blasted by chemo and all:  £8000.00 (over budget not covered).

You've gone over your private health care plan, but don't worry, mum and dad can remortgage the house. That's an extra £150000.00 to play with.

You wait a couple of months to see how the cancer responds. Those scans set you back £7,000.00 each, you have them once a month (£21,000.00 - over budget, not covered)

Its not looking brilliant, they want to put you through two rounds of chemo and see how it responds £80,000.00 (over budget not covered).

Plus pills for both rounds £16,000.00(over budget not covered).

Remarkably its responded brilliantly. They want to put you through one more round of chemo  (£48,000 [inc pills]) see how you respond and then operate on you (£35,000). They're optimistic you could survive this.

But you don't have any money.

Sadly, you die, let say you were the breadwinner for your house. You now have a brand new mortgage to pay. You were all under the same health plan, so your premiums are triple. Then there's the funeral, mortuary costs and hospital over night fees that your private health company stopped paying when you hit the £100,000.00 mark, so your in debt by £10,000...

There's a reason why the NHS is highly guarded national treasure. The trouble is when tories come to power their privatisation eyes melt over the prospects of money their mates could make if they privatize it. 

Remember, its not the NHS thats failing. its the government who when elected said the NHS would be ringfenced because that's what everyone wanted to hear. Now after their right wing newspapers have had a bashing and funding has been 'frozen' for years, the NHS is beginning to crumble.

It's what happens when you don't invest, and that would happen **Regardless** of whether it was private.

On the flip side to that it would be of benefit against teams that like to sit back against us, ie villa, chelsea, united etc. To play with a singular striker and ride the game out waiting for counter attacks.   
We have a good balance of different styles of players, that are all very versatile. For me there is no one way or the other answer here. I can see Brendan switching it up a lot in the coming months too try and break down opponents. The trick is too see who flourishes the best in which system and i also believe this is another reason why we have witnessed so many different formations under Rodgers and that this trend won't stop, it will just be less erratic when were back at full strength.

Assuming from the 'pond' remark you're North American, the accent *will* be noticed but will likely get curiosity rather than scorn, so don't worry there - most people would probably take the conversation from there to asking how you ended up where you are.

Yes but they exploit workers and consumers in the process. They make shitty things not built to last - by design. Imagine you had a TV that could last a lifetime, with easy replaceable parts if anything failed, it would be good for the environment but not Capitalism. If we ran out of things to need the economy would collapse.

His 'gait' vs uncomfortable under pressure is a perfect example. There's a reason that so many neutrals think he's uncomfortable on the ball. 

He has lost the ball numerous times this season and last when under a bit of pressure, and they have lead to goals and big chances. Notably when he conceded a corner earlier this season after getting his legs tangled (opposition scored from the corner). It really was routine defending. 

His misplaced header in the villa game: under very slight pressure, he heads the ball into the centre of the pitch without even looking where he's heading it, and downing runs onto it and scores. Someone argued with me, think it may have been you haha, ""yea but that's where gerrard should have been. Not Sakho's fault"". Yeah, but you still have to look where you're passing the bloody ball. Another example of the 'Sakho apologists' on this sub. 

He's also had a handful of really silly passes and flicks that have put the team under pressure this season, particularly against Swansea! Gets away with bad passing, but then does it again straight after Swansea scored, from the kick off, and Bony nearly equalised! If skrtle did that you'd be calling him a ""liability"" again, like you have many, many, many times! 

 When it comes to positioning, as it's fresh in my mind, Sunderland almost got an equaliser on Saturday after his indecisiveness. Time and space on the edge of our area, and he starts to close the guy down but gets in a tizzy and goes back and just stands and watches. He's done this, along with some iffy marking numerous times. 

I like Sakho, but it's just the circle jerk, and people that exempt him from any mistakes in this sub that is irritating. That's why I say that we don't have a stand out defender, as the whole back line are making a lot of individual errors.

&gt;Yes but they exploit workers 

Despite what you believe, workers are actually almost always paid the full value of their labour. How do you think the value of labour is defined?

&gt;and consumers in the process.

Apparently making stuff I want is ""Exploitation""?

&gt;They make shitty things not built to last - by design. Imagine you had a TV that could last a lifetime, with easy replaceable parts if anything failed, it would be good for the environment but not Capitalism.

Planned obsolescence is not a secret plot to make shitty items for profits. There are multiple reasons for planned obsolescence.

Also, TVs are a bad example. A properly maintained TV can last a lifetime just fine and they do have easily replaceable parts (such as back lights on LCD monitors). The failure point of them is usually something that cannot be improved because of the laws of physics.

1. Making shit last longer becomes more expensive as you increase the lifespan

2. Most items people will only use temporarily. For instance, most people are not going to wear the same clothes they wore as a baby 80 years later. Therefore, there's no reason to make them last 80 years.

3. The item will be improved by the next version so quickly that there's little reason to give the current version a ridiculously long lifespan. 

4. Idiots don't maintain their shit. Pretty much anything can work forever if maintained properly.

5. Physical limits on durability.

Guess what countries were and still are notorious for the awful quality  and terrible lifespan of their goods? Communist ones (or, if you like the no true communist argument, they were at least non-capitalist countries)

This is the golden age for the elimination of poverty. In an incredibly short period of time, we have lifted billions from the suffering of a poor, unhealthy life. This has only occured because of, not in spite of, capitalism.

Pre-capitalism, poverty rates were close to 99%.

&gt;Capitalism does. Look at all the resources we are consuming.

Look at all the industrial disasters and mass inefficiencies non-capitalist countries such as the USSR have. It's the system that created the environmental hell Norilsk. I already explained that capitalism doesn't need to consume resources to bring about economic growth.

null,false,KCCJack,lfc12,,null,"&gt;There's a reason that so many neutrals think he's uncomfortable on the ball. 

Neutrals don't watch him every week, on highlights he will look uncomfortable on the ball but he isn't.

&gt;He has lost the ball numerous times this season and last when under a bit of pressure, and they have lead to goals and big chances. Notably when he conceded a corner earlier this season after getting his legs tangled (opposition scored from the corner). It really was routine defending. 

We play one of the highest defensive lines in the league so all of our CBs are constantly under pressure on the ball, Skrtel in the back 3 that were currently using drops deeper so he has more time to think than the RCB and LCB. Defenders mistakes which lead to a corner aren't a negative thing, if you make a mistake as a defender you want the ball out of play first and foremost, our inability to defend corners is another problem though.

&gt;His misplaced header in the villa game: under very slight pressure, he heads the ball into the centre of the pitch without even looking where he's heading it, and downing runs onto it and scores. Someone argued with me, think it may have been you haha, ""yea but that's where gerrard should have been. Not Sakho's fault"". Yeah, but you still have to look where you're passing the bloody ball. Another example of the 'Sakho apologists' on this sub. 

He does need to improve his heading, and that Villa goal is a typical goal you concede when chasing a lead- midfield pushed up, defenders pushed up and spread out with huge gaps. Those mistakes happen when everyone on your team is desperate for a goal and you leave no protection for the defence.

&gt;He's also had a handful of really silly passes and flicks that have put the team under pressure this season, particularly against Swansea! Gets away with bad passing, but then does it again straight after Swansea scored, from the kick off, and Bony nearly equalised! If skrtle did that you'd be calling him a ""liability"" again, like you have many, many, many times! 

He has to play out from the back under this system and his passing has been very good, when teams press us we have no choice but to make risky passes sometimes

&gt; When it comes to positioning, as it's fresh in my mind, Sunderland almost got an equaliser on Saturday after his indecisiveness. Time and space on the edge of our area, and he starts to close the guy down but gets in a tizzy and goes back and just stands and watches. He's done this, along with some iffy marking numerous times. 

I haven't noticed that so I can't really comment on it tbh

&gt;I like Sakho, but it's just the circle jerk, and people that exempt him from any mistakes in this sub that is irritating. That's why I say that we don't have a stand out defender, as the whole back line are making a lot of individual errors. 

Trust me I hate how circlejerky this sub gets, and Sakho has his faults but I genuinely believe he is our stand out defender, and we're quitely making less mistakes as a unit, hopefully it sticks haha",null,0,null,1421112325,null,0,false,0,cnn30ok,null,t3_2s7yeb,null,t1_cnn30ok,null,t1_cnn2l3b,null,null,null,1424909988,null,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

null,false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"&gt;If you sell via an app store or retailer, the contract is between the retailer and the consumer, so your VAT threshold isn't relevant. This means that VAT is applied to all purchases in the UK too.

&gt;What this means in actual figures is that if I sell an app for 79p to a UK customer (the new tier 1 price on the App Store), Apple take their 30% cut, they take another 20% to pay the VAT and I'm left with 46p (about 58.2%). Prior to the change I got 70% of all income. Big difference.

&gt;I believe we should only be liable for VAT once we reach the thresholds in each relevant country.

Under these rules if you sell through iTunes or Amazon you are not the ultimate vendor and you are **not** paying any VAT.  iTunes/Amazon is paying VAT on sales they make and they changed the nature of the contract between themselves and you as a supplier to them.  Their cut of a £1 sale drops to 80p after VAT and they're paying you your share from that.

I can fully appreciate that it's galling, but it's no different to what would happen if iTunes or Amazon lowered their consumer price by 20% and your cut of the sale value remained the same.

What you need to maintain the old position is an arrangement where the online vendor acts as a matchmaker, linking you to me; with your making the supply directly to me.  They could then invoice you for their cut.  Perhaps someone will see this as an opportunity to set up an app store equivalent of Etsy.

The problem is that the retailers such as iTunes and Amazon have no incentive to change anything.  It's better for the online retailer to just lower what they pay you.  They have all the leverage and they know it.

&gt; They also, the debriefing suggested, have too many bases, spend insufficient time living among the people, are not in Afghanistan long enough to learn about the people or the place, and are generally deficient in trained intelligence-gatherers. They are ""cautious about the enemy and overestimate their strength"", are too secretive about sharing information, have insufficient cash to dole out, and are disrupted by their system of R&amp;R (rest and recreation). Finally - insult of insults - the British were told: ""Your standards of personal hygiene and field discipline aren't good enough and you have too many non-battle injuries.""

By the way, you might want to check out [Independent Liverpool](http://independent-liverpool.co.uk/profiles/), which is an association of independently owned shops, restaurants, bars and cafes (and the Hope Street Hotel). It should also give you an idea of what places are 'proper' local, although obviously not every local business is included. [You can get discount cards for £10 each](http://independent-liverpool.co.uk/membership), and that usually gives you at least 10% off drinks, bills or hotel rooms, so it might be worth considering getting hold of a couple if there's enough places that look worth visiting, and they're valid for a whole year.

It's been a while since that comment I linked to, so here's a bit of follow up on places I've been to or heard about, from the Independent Liverpool list:

Pubs &amp; Bars

* **Maya** - Very weird bar, with a couple of cell-like booths and neon crosses, serving drinks in jam jars and other weird containers. A little bit expensive for Liverpool, but a solid choice.

* **Bar Bodega** - A little bit cheaper, with a nice interior, but quite small, cramped and loud. Not really suitable for large groups.

* **Saltdog Slims** - I've heard good things - if you like hotdogs and beer, you can't go wrong. If you don't like hot dogs or beer, you're onto a loser!

* **Studio 2** - I've only ever managed to stumble in on a weekday evening just before closing time, but it's a really nice venue, and 2 cocktails for £10 with Independent Liverpool cards. It's also a former music studio with some famous tracks recorded there, but it's not shoved in your face.

* **Aloha** - Not my cup of tea at all. It's so cheesy, with its 'Hawaiian' decor, and bad music. It's down to taste, but I wouldn't.

* **Cafe Tabac** - If you can get a table booked, you're sorted for the evening. They do decent food, including tapas, and have a well stocked bar. There's sometimes a DJ from half 9ish, so it's not too formal.

* **Heebie Jeebies** - It's usually quite busy, but for good reason - the music is more to my personal taste (with plenty of popular rock &amp; roll tunes on some nights), and it's a fairly cheap too.

Restaurants

* **The Egg** - Not actually been there myself yet, but I have friends who LOVE it, and it is arguably the best selection of vegetarian food in Liverpool: pretty cheap and casual too.

* **London Carriage Works** - Almost obscenely posh - must be seen to be believed.

* **Cafe Tabac** - If you can get a table booked, you're sorted for the evening. They do decent food, including tapas, and have a well stocked bar. There's sometimes a DJ from half 9ish, so it's not too formal.

* **Nolita Cantina** - Very good burgers. They seem a little expensive until your plate arrives, and then you see the size of them!

* **Lucha Libre** - Mexican food, with loads to choose from. I'd recommend it. It's above Maya.

* **Amalia** - All the Italian food you could think of. It's down a side street, so not the easiest to find. Don't do the Calzone challenge though.

* **Tapas Tapas** - I've not been, but heard good things about it.

* **Lunya** - It's a little expensive, but some really 'artisan' food. The interior is partly in an old warehouse, which is really cool.",null,0,null,1421112682,null,0,false,0,cnn387k,null,t3_2s6vhk,null,t1_cnn387k,null,t1_cnn05xb,null,null,null,1424909891,null,1,false,Liverpool,t5_2r21z,1,null

I'm as excited as anyone to see Kane play for England but I foresee an issue:

Harry Kane has very similar strengths, weakness and playing style, to England's captain and key player; Wayne Rooney. 

Both are 'second strikers', both come deep for the ball, both want to run at defences with the ball at their feet, both seem best when paired with a more traditional 9 ahead of them.

Fitting them into the same team may prove difficult.

Or maybe Kane will be adaptable enough to force himself to play more like a 9.

I don't think we would have seen the vast response if there was no ""Je Suis Charlie"" which really gave everyone something to rally around and identify with. But also the target of the attack was important too, a lot of the international response was focussing on defending free speech and liberty, that means a lot of the language on social media and everywhere else was defiant and principled from the start rather than more focused on grief as with other terrorist attacks like the one you have mentioned. So I also don't think we would have seen the same response if the tone was more somber.


Another way of putting that these people knew they were in danger meaning in effect they died for their principles, leading to an international response in support of those principles. That type of response is different when it's people just going about their normal daily lives who die.


Overall I think it's down to social media and the principles in tandem. If (sadly probably when) there is the next terrorist attack on a city we'll probably see people spreading ""I am City"" or something similar, but we already know it won't have the same outcome, it needs the values too.

Incorrect. Surplus value is stolen from the workers in the form of profits.

You can make stuff without exploitation. 

&gt;A properly maintained TV can last a lifetime

It could, but that would be bad for business. Much more profitable to release a new one every year and convince people to buy it by telling them they'd be happier/smarter/sexier with it. 

Our whole culture is based around consumerism, there is a constant pressure on everyone to spend their money on the next thing. Advertising is very effective at employing the use of all sorts of psychological techniques to get you to part with your cash.  

&gt;This is the golden age for the elimination of poverty.

Are you serous? There is enough global wealth to eliminate poverty right now. Capitalism is a system that requires competition - there has to be winners and looser. The Bangladeshi sweat shop worker has to suffer in poverty so you can get a cheap T-shirt, and the owners of the company can make profit. 

&gt;Look at all the industrial disasters and mass inefficiencies non-capitalist countries such as the USSR have

USSR was state capitalist, same shit different owners. Besides industrial disasters and mass inefficiencies happen regularly in capitalist countries.

&gt; I already explained that capitalism doesn't need to consume resources to bring about economic growth.

It clearly does consume resources at an ever expanding rate, due to growth though. Every year a new iPhone, TV, games console, car, toothbrush, electric tin opener... comes out that is only a slight improvement on the previous model. Why? Profit. 

At our current rate of consumption we are going to need another 3 planets by 2050.

We will be living here for some years, and then move back to the UK (i'm an only child and want to be near to my mother as she gets towards old age, my wife is one of five so her parents are more adequately covered).


Houses:

- Poorly built (mostly wood, brick is rare though it does differ by region) compared to UK

- Poorly insulated compared to UK

- Lots are huge by default compared to UK

- Simple things we take for granted, such as RCD fuse boxes, are a luxury; if lightning strikes, anything not behind protection is done for

- Space efficiency in design is not a priority since it doesn't need to be


Healthcare:

- There are wait times for all the same things that there are wait times for in the UK; I was always under the impression that the US system is hyper expensive but you're seen straight away, this is wrong

- Quality of care is no better than the UK; this is something I always intrinsically thought, that this system is amazing for customer service, quality of care, etc, but it's really not

- Having insurance, while necessary in many respects, means very little; if your insurer fancies wriggling out of it on a technicality, they will do, and good luck paying the lawyer fees to get them to do their job

- The bills are frighteningly high, because the hospitals aren't regulated, so they charge whatever they fancy because they know your insurance *should* cover it; some routine bloodwork for me cost me $250 *after* insurance, I've seen others who were looking at $50,000 for a broken limb

- I'm glad I'm young and in good health that I don't need to have too many run-ins with the system, it's designed to screw you over at every given opportunity


Internet:

- You're on Reddit, you already know how terrible it is

- To be fair, where I live specifically is one of the few places that has more than two providers. We have Comcast, AT&amp;T UVerse, and two local providers. Based on price/performance, we went with Comcast and they have actually been alright. We bought our own router to save ourselves money and trouble and stream a ton of Netflix with no issue


TV:

- Way too many ads


Roads / Transport:

- The country is vast; people who have never been just don't know how vast until they do go

- The road system works but there's a lot of illogical things, like incredibly liberal use of stop signs

- Like I said above, four way stops with stop signs are way too common and incredibly annoying since you're having to stop every other block; I find my inner self shouting ""JUST USE A DAMN ROUNDABOUT""

- Turn right on red is amazing and I wish it was done in the UK (but reversed, obviously)

- Don't even bother with public transport unless you're in a big city, you're driving most everywhere


Food:

- Supermarkets are largely the same, though I'd say that their ""high end"" stores are our ""mid range"" stores; something like a Waitrose has no analogue in terms of quality over there, the best you'll get is if you're lucky enough to be near a Wegmans

- There are *a lot* of different restaurants, you'll never be stuck for places to go

- Food quality in restaurants are definitely better, menus are a lot bigger

- Portions are bigger

- Asking to get a ""to-go"" box for unfinished food won't cause the waiting staff to look at you as if you just walked into their house on Christmas day and pissed on their kids

Schools:

- Homeschooling is a thing, legal, and is popular; in some places of incredible poverty, homeschooling will actually be better than the public school, in other cases it's a shitty way to ensure your child will be flipping burgers for my child in 20 years time

- Kind of like in the UK, it's a lottery to be born in an area with a decent school; since states differ in their execution of education, if you're born in a backwards state that doesn't value education or certain topics, then you're disadvantaged compared to a more progressive state


I could go on, but that's all I can think of off the top of my head. When I was back living in the UK, before my experience with the US, I used to hate it in the UK. Complained about everything, thought every country did everything better. My experiences living in the US have shown me that, while we aren't perfect, we have things very *very* good in the UK. I do miss it, but have no resentment being here. My life is good, for all intents and purposes, and there are a lot of places that are a lot worse than here.",null,0,null,1421116022,null,0,false,0,cnn56vw,null,t3_2s5dat,null,t1_cnn56vw,null,t1_cnn1jl1,null,null,null,1424908910,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null
null,false,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,null,"We've exceeded my expectation in terms of table position, but fell well short of my expectations of playing style and development.

Chelsea result aside, we've not played any particularly good matches, and you could count the number of good halves we've played on one hand.  I really expected this season to be a bit of a wash (6th - 8th place) results-wise, but I did think by the turn of the year we'd be seeing more style, more of an attacking threat, and a better drilled unit overall.

Instead I feel like all the problems of the AVB era (slow transition from defence to attack, lack of width, lack of creative imagination, lack of a genuine goal threat up front, vulnerabilities to counter attacks) are still there, except now we're simply pressing more and have Fazio to sure up our central defence.  It's not like I feel we've made no progress, but it's certainly been underwhelming.

I've said this elsewhere on this sub, but I really feel like we don't have enough quality players to fill an entire starting line up, let alone balance the challenges of three cup competitions.  The squad's roster needs to be refreshed, and I think the sooner we can start that, the better.  We're so overly reliant on Eriksen, Chadli and Kane at the moment that they'll burn out soon (just look at Mason).

I like Poch, but it still feels like there are a lot of pieces of the puzzle missing.  Koeman this season and Martinez last season both showed that you can come of the blocks amazingly well in a mid-table club.  Not that we should expect immediate success, but it is curious to me that after a full pre-season and more than half a season, we can still play as badly as we did against Palace and Burnley.",null,0,null,1421116027,null,0,false,0,cnn570l,null,t3_2s88d9,null,t1_cnn570l,null,t3_2s88d9,null,null,null,1424908907,null,8,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,8,null

No. Surplus value isn't a thing. Marxian economics is simply wrong on this issue. Supporting the idea of surplus value is the economics equivalent of being a creationist.

&gt;Much more profitable to release a new one every year and convince people to buy it by telling them they'd be happier/smarter/sexier with it.

Why did you completely ignore my explanation of why we don't make stuff out of indestructium.

&gt;Capitalism is a system that requires competition - there has to be winners and looser.

Economics is not a zero sum game. When trade occurs, both sides win. Denying this basic economic principle is as unscientific as global warming denialism.

&gt;The Bangladeshi sweat shop worker has to suffer in poverty

The Bangladeshi sweat shop worker gets paid a higher wage each year, with more stable and healthier conditions than their former jobs as subsistence farmers. Why the fuck do you think they move to cities to take these jobs in the first place? To you, with your cushy 1st world extravagant and hypocritical lifestyle, may be too uneducated to tell the difference between subsistance farming and low-wage jobs, but the people living in the 3rd world sure as fuck know what they prefer. Why do you insist on taking what few opportunities they have away from them in the name of blind anti-capitalism?

You can't just define everything you don't like as ""capitalism"" without a rational explanation. That's not how definitions work.

He is the best threat from set pieces, especially corners with the near post run.  

Though he isn't perfect, as other have pointed out, he still is the most consistent defender.  Some may argue Sahko is better but he cannot stay healthy something Skrtel has done for a long time.  I would like to see his passing improve but every player could be better at something.  

I have no faith in any of the other non-starting defenders.  I'd like to see Wisdom play in a 3 at the back role but Coates is too slow, Illori I have no idea about and not sure any of the academy players are up for it.  

I'm not sure Kolo will be here next year so we need senior players.  Also since LFC will likely be without CL football, brining in a 'world class' defender will be extremely difficult.  

And as for the people questioning his leadership abilities, not every leader has to be a vocal, rah-rah type.  Some are quiet that do so by actions, something Skrtel does quite well.  I do see him organizing the defense on set pieces, I'm just not sure what instructions he was given by BR to do.  Also whether or not the instructions are followed is anyone's guess.

Correct, but a player coming in at 21, at a fairly big club, is **usually** thought of as having a higher ceiling. Just the way it goes.

You'd be right... except that attacking fullbacks are a major component of how we play. Of all our fullbacks, only Naughton has somewhat deep defensive positioning.

But then Carroll came back and he changed his tactics back to hoofing up the middle and we stopped winning and stopped scoring, I think if Carroll was being played like Sakho and Valencia were when we were playing that football that was actually on the ground it would have worked wonders but instead he is getting pretty average service and its just not working.

I think that we should be playing like we used to with Song playing balls into Cresswell and Jenkinson and getting crosses into the box and Carroll will score no doubt.

No (that's you crudely trying to claim false authority via the mechanism of an inference I have little or no knowledge ;) ), but I certainly wouldn't deliberately choose to ignore facts and/or history nor would I condone such a behaviour. 

Furthermore, if I were employed at taxpayer expense as a Govt Minister, I would do my very best to make sure I was qualified to do that job, by actually knowing about that which I am supposed to represent/control as a part of my Ministerial duties ...

 ... Clearly Mr Javid lacks my sense of due diligence.

It also has to cast *serious* doubt as to value of the current cabinet to the taxpayer, when at least one of them irrefutably isn't qualified for their post.

Doesn't the Minister of Culture's demonstrated ignorance about culture/cultural matters indicate quite clearly to that he is not suited to that post (a square peg forced into a round hole as it were), or ring any alarm bells for you?

Personally [I would suggest that a chancellor with a taste for the finest Columbian flake](http://tompride.wordpress.com/2014/07/30/woman-arrested-for-posting-photo-of-george-osborne-at-prostitutes-flat/) is a major liability to a first world economy like the UK's...

Surplus value absolutely is a thing. It's the difference between the workers wage and the value of good and services they produce.

If they weren't being exploited by capitalists they would get to keep all the surplus value. They would have vastly better conditions if ran their own workplaces.

&gt;You can't just define everything you don't like as ""capitalism"" without a rational explanation.

I thought state capitalism was a well defined term here's googles definition that you can find in two seconds if you bothered looking:

*State capitalism is usually described as an economic system in which commercial (i.e. for-profit) economic activity is undertaken by the state, with management and organization of the means of production in a capitalist manner, including the system of capital accumulation, wage labor, and centralized management.*

**Capitalism requires growth** our planet has social and ecological limits.

Advertising plays a massive role in making us want things as well as the consumer culture engineered by Capitalist media. For more on this I recommend the documentary The Century of Self.

They are incredible inaccurate. They are the equivalent of a 200 year old chinese whispers game. The marriage story in question is based on the reports by various companions of the prophet Muhammad, as recorded by others from later generations. In these reported sayings, there are discrepancies/contradictions regarding what her age was at the time of marriage, ranging from [9 to 20 years old.](http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_151_200/ayesha_age_the_myth_of__a_prover.htm)



Most historians theorise that she was engaged/betrothed at the age of nine, but did not consummate until after her puberty.

Source: Reza Aslan - No god but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam

Also the Quran itself says marriage before puberty/physical maturity is forbidden [4:6, 24:31, 24:58-59]

Also the morals and societal norms of a 6th Century Society of desert nomads cannot be compared to modern ethics and social morals. Even if she was in her early teens, it would have been perfectly normal and conventional.

Also finally, Aisha was the Muhammad's last wife, every wife he had before her were all middle-aged and not virgins. So why would he suddenly take a child bride out of the blue?

Firstly, dont believe anything the press says. Most of it is just used to generate views. Only consider something if it has quotes. 

Secondly, We are a very tightly run ship, which is a good thing. Levy (our chairman) has taken our middle table club to one of the top 6 in the League with arguably the best academy in england (probably just behind Southampton but fuck them they dont have harry kane). In order to propel ourselves to the next level, top 4+, we have to use a lot of capital to improve the infrastructure of the club. We cannot outspend our means and get hit with FFP. Instead, we have to use every means possible to have the club generate its own money. 

Now in response to the 35 million. Theres no way we will spend that much on one player. Spurs have always had a maverick player that fills the cracks. Its time we built a solid team that work their socks off for the club. Also we have a MASSIVE squad and some ridiculous wages. We cant really afford to take someone else's superstar wages of 80+/wk. 

We have about 1/3 to 1/2 of the wage bill that clubs above us have. We cant sign the big boys as easily as you think. Anyways, kinda went all over the shop, but i hope it helped.

This is a lazy, narrow-minded, and frankly xenophobic statement. You ever think it could be because people are getting warnings for standing up and making noise? Strict stewarding has long been a complaint among supporters. Someone mentioned the Shed End, and that area is very audible but it's the area where away fans are housed. That's another factor. 

The supporters that often put themselves on a pedestal are matchday-goers. These are the ones fortunate enough to have been born close to the club they support. The general belief is that these are proper fans and proper fans sing. But the season ticket allocation is 30,000, so 72% of the total capacity. Adding in away fans that leaves ~11% of tickets to the public. Are you trying to say it's these 11% is the reason the atmosphere is not great? But I get it, it's easier to pass the buck. 

Our away support is almost always excellent, so it shows there are fans that want to vocally support the team (in addition to travel). If they were ever to introduce singing sections like they're looking into or safe standing (we can only hope) I feel like it would drastically increase the atmosphere.

The Doctor claimed to be delirious after his sexist remark to Amy and the holographic Amelia is was a pretty bad voice interface. When this episode aired in 2011, we Terrans had better voice interfaces like Apple's Siri and IBM's Watson. The holographic Amelia doesn't say it was the poison of the Judas Tree that disabled regeneration, merely that regeneration was disabled. It's possible that Time Lord biology disables regeneration after twelve regenerations. We know that this can be re-enabled by high-ranking Time Lords, but not by a single Time Lord (The council offered to give the Master another regeneration in ""The Five Doctors"", but Borusa was unable to give himself another one as Lord President). 

A couple episodes later, we're told that Chen-7 can kill a Time Lord, and that the Doctor won't regenerate. It's weird that suddenly all these things can kill Time Lords permanently pop up so late in the Doctor's regeneration cycle. It's almost like the count is off by one or two.

It's also possible the Doctor thought the meta-crisis regeneration didn't count toward his limit and only found out when his face began to visibly age over the course of six hundred years instead of changing to a new one.",null,0,null,1421130494,null,0,false,0,cnnclh8,null,t3_2s8fpj,null,t1_cnnclh8,null,t3_2s8fpj,null,null,null,1424905418,null,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9,null

2) With Sterling, Markovic, Lallana and Coutinho fighting to start, the 3 in front of our defensive mids have loads of talent. We just need to gel completely to dominate the middle. 
3)With Sturridge return all of us are hoping for a miraculous comeback. However this wont be the case, he will need time to get fully match fit. All we can hope for is that he puts in a great shift week in and week out without sustaining another injury.

Finally, I received grants to cover my fieldwork from a foundation in the UK that offers money to students in my field and took out some federal student loan money. I patched funding together because, in my department, full funding packages were not available for international students and for a number of reasons, I chose to study in the UK. I also supplemented my scholarship funds by working part-time (at the time I got my student visa, international students could work 20 hrs a week outside of term time and 40 hrs a week during breaks). I worked on campus at a very quiet front desk where I could also work on my thesis. I also did highly paid contract research work. Do the schools you are applying to have graduate finance offices?

I patched funding together because, in my department, full funding packages were not available for international students and for a number of reasons, I chose to study in the UK. I also supplemented my scholarship funds by working part-time (at the time I got my student visa, international students could work 20 hrs a week outside of term time and 40 hrs a week during breaks).

To be honest, other than the Muslim community there are very few black people in Swansea. You do see a few at games but not many, but maybe that's just representative of our population. 

With Muslims, all the lads I knew in school supported teams like Manchester United and that hasn't changed since. Again, you'll see a few but in this case not an amount representative to the population. While this might be in part to them not feeling confident about being welcomed, there are two other factors at play here. The first is that their fathers aren't Swans fans so they don't get introduced to it like most of us were, and the second is that as most Muslims don't drink they don't get introduced to it as young adults as part of a 'day out' in the pubs and then to the game like a lot of other people are. Essentially they'd have to just turn up to their first game off their own backs and not many people do that, Muslim or otherwise.

It's hardly a white only area though - we get a lot of Koreans studying at the local uni who come to games without trouble, and they turn up in groups and with South Korean flags. They've been coming since Ki arrived and nobody is bothered by it.

There are probably still some racists in the stands but they know anything overt and aggressive won't be tolerated by stadium staff or likely other fans any more.

&gt; **She was examined by a doctor and various samples were taken. As a result of an examination of the samples, at that stage, notwithstanding the direct evidence that she had had a good deal to drink the evening before, no alcohol was detected**. That may have been the consequence of its elimination over the course of time. Expert evidence sought to reconstruct the amount of alcohol she had consumed at an earlier stage. The doctor found no injuries to the complainant. The tests also revealed traces of cocaine and cannabis. The evidence was consistent with cocaine and cannabis having been ingested some days earlier.

&gt; When he arrived at the room it was immediately apparent to him that McDonald and the complainant were engaged in enthusiastic consensual sex. When she was asked if the applicant could join in, the complainant clearly replied ""Yes"". McDonald stopped. The complainant asked the applicant to perform oral sex on her. He did so and then they had sexual intercourse. Throughout all the activities with him she was enthusiastic, wide awake and she consented to everything that happened.

&gt; **The expert called by the defence calculated that the complainant's likely blood-alcohol level at about 4am would have approximated to something like 2½ times the legal driving limit. He gave evidence that she would have suffered from slurred speech and unsteadiness of gait, but he would not have expected any memory loss**. It was an essential part of his expert evidence that there were significant doubts about the claim made by the complainant that she had suffered a memory loss. In effect, it was suggested that her assertion was false.

&gt; Today, the jury was played two video interviews the woman gave to police in which **she described drinking four doubles of vodka and lemonade at a busy Rhyl nightspot, and a shot of sambuca**.

&gt; “**I felt tipsy but not out of control**,” she told police.

&gt; “**I usually drink more than that.** I haven’t blacked out before, not being able to remember anything.”

I absolutely believe you can risk your own health and life for whatever reason you want, but you can rarely fully accept the risk when you have no choice if you want to take home a pay cheque. It's different to taking on the risks of a more dangerous job, but you'd still reasonably expect your employer to properly maintain equipment etc even if your job requires you to dangle from a rope hundreds of meters in the air.

Given that only an insane person could possibly believe this I wonder how people come to the conclusion that sky high unemployment is suddenly due to a handful of Poles. Maybe they aren't racist but are simply a bit thick? Who knows?

What I do know is that banning immigration won't do anything to help these people. Therefore there is pretty much no reason to bother trying to understand their concerns because they are based upon a fallacy. They won't bother dealing with the facts so confrontation is inevitable. The goal then is to ensure that these people are a minority so their opinions never get traction.

Overall I agree with your argument about freedom, but there's a difference between measurable, tangent activities and intangible, immeasurable voicing of ideas and dissent.

To use your examples - guns are a tool of death - they can be used positively for hunting (which we allow) or for violence against other people. It is therefore very easy to control ownership, it is non-discriminatory and it is very clear when the law has been broken - possession of a gun without a license. It requires no interpretation unlike possession of a drawing of a gun, or possession of an opinion about guns, or distributing material about guns.

How about driving? Cars are a physical tool of transportation. Again, the law applies to everyone in a non-discriminatory manner. Driving is legal, but speed is a tangible and measurable. The law is against breaking the speed limit - there is no interpretation required... you can't say that your car was convincing you to go faster, you can't say that possession of a copy of Torque made you a speeder or being a fan of Top Gear and being influenced by the teachings of Jeremy Clarkson.

The dangerous thing about monitoring ""extremists"" and laws against offensiveness and hate is that these are intangible things, formed of ideas and sentiments, not based on actions or measurable products. People making bad or tasteless jokes are being prosecuted subjectively - and on the discriminatory basis that it caused a certain level of offence. How can you define what is offensive, as you would a speed limit of 70? You really can't - some people find Jeremy Clarkson offensive but does that mean he should be arrested for hate-speech? He has massive influence and no doubt some of his ""followers"" do break the speed limit - is Top Gear responsible for that?

I do not trust the government to monitor people on such an intangible and subjective terms as ""extremism"". I have no doubt that if every reddit post in /r/uk was to be put through a government filter that more than half of redditors would be considered some kind of extremist individual in need of monitoring due to their hate-speech, intolerance, offensiveness or political ideology. Let's face it, the only thing saving redditors from being reported by the likes of the media is because they rely on it so much for padding their own news content.",null,0,null,1421141901,null,0,false,0,cnnfmsx,null,t3_2s8re6,null,t1_cnnfmsx,null,t1_cnne2ng,null,null,null,1424903874,null,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17,null

People complain that h&amp;s is just common sense and it is - but with the knowledge to apply it (if you don't know a risk exists you can't apply common sense to avoid it, some are obvious, some really are not, I doubt most people know the risks of most uncommon chemicals off the top of their head, which is why someone looks it up). It's also applying it in the right place, generally thinking about it in advance and taking measures then, not hoping everyone will every time they use /do it. In this situation it should be pretty obvious that you could get trapped because you can't see inside, they also had multiple near misses with people almost getting trapped but managing to jump out before the doors closed, so they must have known it was a problem. 

It's pretty much common sense that maybe you need some way to check before turning it on, or disable the machine while someone in inside (even just a sign to put over the controls), yes there are expensive engineering controls that would be a lot better but they could have done something at virtually no cost if they had taken an hour to think about it -  this thinking about it is the risk assessment (that they didn't do).

null,false,turkeywelder,null,null,null,"Yes, sorry - I was on mobile so had no patience for typing then! Here's the (very) basics, I'd recommend reading Monevator's blog posts on passive investing as they're really good for outlining things, plus they're free.

The fund is the actual thing you're buying units of.  In broad terms there's two types of funds: Index and Managed.  Managed funds pay a fund manager to pick and choose the investment, Index funds just throw the money into whatever  investments the fund is made up of, electronically.  This is why index trackers are cheaper, they've not got to pay a dedicated manager (or team of managers). 

Index trackers usually come in two flavours; Accumulation units or Income units (http://monevator.com/income-units-versus-accumulation-units-difference/).  The fund itself determines how much risk you're taking on, where your investment is (UK, USA, Global?) and what you're actually buying.  Fund charges generally cover the costs of investing into the fund and managing your money in it.  This is where your gains can be made over the long term, so lower fund costs give you more return and allow you to invest more as the income/accumulation compounds.

Examples of Funds (sticking with index funds here, and bear in mind there are THOUSANDS, so do your research and make sure it's what you want to invest in):

*  Vanguard FTSE All Share Index
* There's a big list here: http://www.hl.co.uk/funds/index-tracker-funds 

Loads of research data available from Morningstar (http://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/)( and Trustnet on funds (http://www.trustnet.com/).  Note that past performance isn't any indication of future performance and you can lose money.

The platform is basically just like a bank account, they give you access to buy the fund, allow you to manage regular investments, manage your NISA (if you invest in one) and usually give you web access to your account, allow you to withdraw your funds, track their value etc.

Examples of platforms:

 * Hargreaves Lansdown
 * Charles Stanley Direct
 * iWeb
 * Clubfinance
 * everything else on http://www.comparefundplatforms.com/ 

Bear in mind some platforms only give you access to the funds they deal with, HL deal with loads, but for index trackers, you'll usually find most platforms deal with the big ones (Vanguard, HSBC, SWIP). Compare costs for actually buying the fund, any annual charges, and any platform fees too.  HL are quite expensive, but have excellent customer service and a good site.  

You can move between platforms, but some charge you to leave or move your investments, so bear that in mind too.  

I'd really recommend reading Tim Hale's ""Smarter Investing"" as he covers all of the terms, risks and costs, how to build a portfolio, how to balance and asses risk and gives some great advice on why to choose index investing over a managed fund.  It's £25 well spent, as HL will charge you £24 a year to hold most funds....

None of this is financial advice, I'm a random internet stranger, don't buy anything you don't understand yourself :)

Hope this helps, ask more questions and we'll try and help out.

null,false,Froolow,null,null,null,"I wrote part of my dissertation on Dasatinib, so if the other drugs are anything like that one then the likelihood is that there is some weak evidence the drug does better than the best possible alternative in clinical trials, but that that might mean increasing progression-free survival rather than overall survival or some other proxy endpoint measure (i.e. the drugs can add a few months onto the end of a life which is already terminal, but are unlikely to put the cancer into complete remission any better than our current best treatment). The reason the evidence is weak is not because drugs companies are behaving badly and not testing it properly, but because so few people have a particular cancer which is also resistent to all other known treatments that it is very difficult to conduct a well-populated clinical trial in reasonable timeframes.

The problem is that for this small increase in overall survival the NHS has to pay an absolutely enormous amount. Aflibercept is a bit of an odd case because it is competing with wAMD drugs as well as bowel cancer drugs and costs only £6000 for a year of treatment, but if I remember correctly Cetuximab costs about £30,000 / year (which is about average for a rare cancer drug) and there are some rare cancer drugs (not on this list) that cost £250,000 - £300,000 per year (Teduglutide, for example). So it costs about £100,000 for Dasatanib to add the equivalent of one extra healthy life-year, whereas it costs about £20 for the equivalent life-year when considering a more common drug like Warfarin for a more common condition like Atrial Fibrillation.

This means that you are buying a small amount of additional health for a large amount of additional money. This money has to come from elsewhere in the NHS, where it could be used to buy more health for the same amount of money. The NHS has a cut-off of about £20,000 / £30,000 per additional healthy life-year where they calculate that above this threshold it is not worth purchasing the health because the spending it displaces would almost certianly have been put to better use. To an economist, therefore, this is a no-brainer; the cancer drugs fund should have been shut down years ago because it is buying extra life at a cost of £100,000 per year and giving up extra life at a cost of £20 a year as a result. However I know plenty of oncologists who don't care about that; they argue that the 'Rule of Rescue' means that if there is a drug which could add life-years to a patient then it is an ethical obligation to give it even if that means increasing taxes next year to top up the cancer drugs fund. You can take them through all the economic reasoning I outline above and they will still argue that ethics trumps economics.

So if Dasatanib is a good proxy for the others we're not talking about £100m spent on junk, but we are talking about preventing people getting drugs the best evidence says could help them in exchange for getting more help to different people. Overall I think it is an ethical rather than clinical problem.

In August of 2014, Rotherham was the centre of a child sexual exploitation scandal involving 1400 children. Now, if the perpetrators were white British males, the people who reported them would have been hailed as heroes. There would have been mass outrage, with the media calling for the perpetrators to be locked up and the keys thrown away. But this was not the case. The abusers were “predominantly of Pakistani heritage” and that was a problem. We like to think that everyone is equal in this country, but certain people, usually left wingers, tend to be fine with overlooking certain things when it involves ethnic minorities.

I think you've massively missed the point about Rotherham and you only have to look as far as the scandals involving the 70s and 80s tv personalities and MPs to see why.  The same thing happened there, so the 'if the perpetrators were where white British males' has already been done.  It took 20 or 30 years of campaigning and numerous deleted reports to see why this wasn't the case.

&gt; [From Wikipedia]: One Home Office researcher, attempting to raise concerns with senior police officers in 2002 over the level of abuse, was told not to do so again, and was subsequently suspended and sidelined.

As you will have discovered if you had read the source of this, the Home Office Researcher was firstly a contractor (so 'subsequently suspended and sidelined' is disingenuous at best) and secondly wasn't told 'not to do so again' but was asked to go on a course so that she could raise it in the appropriate manner.

&gt; Lefties are so eager to guilt people out that it had effectively prevented some of those who suspected something horrid was going on from doing the right thing.

Actually I think most 'lefties' or even 'Righties' would have much preferred it if the police had done their job in the first place.  What I would prefer is that when someone puts 2 and 2 together to get 4 and realises that this is a problem, we are in a situation where we can deal with it.  What I don't want is for situations when someone puts 1 and 2 together to get 4 and starts going on about it.  Or when someone puts 7 and 10 together and deliberately gets 4 because they want to push forward their agenda (which is what the Daily Mail do constantly).

&gt; At the end of last year, UKIP representatives were set to have a debate about abortion at Oxford University. Ideally, these students who disagreed with UKIP should have been happy to debate with them, and to use their ideas to hope change the minds of those they were debating with. To DISCUSS.

Whilst I agree with the right of UKIP (and this wasn't really a UKIP issue, it was a pro/against abortion issue) to be able to talk about this if they want, I also think that a student union should have the right to decide what they want to discuss.  If UKIP want to have this debate, have it somewhere willing to have them and don't force it onto others who don't want it.  Your right to free speech doesn't mean I have to listen to you and it doesn't mean that an institution has to afford you the platform.

&gt; Then a website called spike-online decided to write a fictitious news segment about what the reaction would have been in the UK if Charlie Hebdo were to have been made here, and demonstrates all too well what the leftie so called ‘do-gooders’ would likely have done to get it shut down.

A couple of weeks later, same guy with the same story! Shows me for being judgemental and trusting a posh guy I guess.

Another time I was in a massive queue for a taxi at Bristol temple meads and a guy said he needed £3 or something to get a ticket for the last train home, saying he'd had a fight with his girlfriend who'd kicked him out of the car and driven off with all his stuff... He seemed quite desperate so I gave him £3, then he said ""actually I need £3.20 to completely cover the ticket"" so I gave him another 20p... He ran into the ticket hall as if to get his ticket. About ten minutes later he came back out and started asking more people the same thing! I think he expected me to be gone by then, but this was one long taxi queue.

Ultimately I'm just very unlikely to trust any of these stories ever again, but if someone is desperate enough for money to spend their time begging this way, I might take sympathy and give them a little bit of change anyway.

Planning permission reform and a land value tax to encourage people to actually build or sell combined with stricter quality requirements to make sure that money saved on land is reflected in quality and not just profit margins would go a long way to help solve it.

The prophet Mohamed did things that are rightly condemned by decent people. Holding him up as the example of how to live your life is a horrible thing to do that should be ridiculed.

Just because it was unpopular in England before does not mean it won't work in the future.  

Brendan played the 3-5-2 for periods last year before stumbling on the 4-4-2 diamond that worked and found no reason to change.  Every coach is a fan of those formations, they are the most popular ones that every manager plays at some point.  That is like saying you like drinks that have water in them.  

What missing personnel? Sturridge is the only first team player out, he is playing it because it works for the style of play they want.  (width from the wingbacks, pressing from forwards and playing it out of the back).  Actually the only reason it hasn't been more successful is because they are playing it without a recognized striker.  

They aren't playing the 4-4-2 diamond because it doesn't work anymore. CBs were getting exposed, Gerrard became neutralized and the midfield was getting overrun.

You have missed the point with Rotherham somewhat. The reality is not simply that ""lefties"" stopped it being investigated with being branded racist and that is the end of the story. The report goes into some detail, the main issue was the lack of resources of social services and that Police were unwilling to take reports seriously. There were concerns by staff about specifically reporting the ethnicity of the abusers, but this has become the sole focus for some at the exclusion of everything else. The fact this has been used to further an agenda is quite sad really and doesn't actually help the situation here or elsewhere.

It is useless in case there is more investment in social services who can deal with it. How is it helpful to almost triumphantly say it is purely Labour's fault?

TODAY’S FT has an interesting letter from Shaun Spiers, the director of the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), a pressure group which campaigns against development in England’s countryside. Missives from the CPRE are not normally worth paying any attention to, but this one is interesting because it explains one of the pervasive myths about the cause of Britain’s housing crisis. Planning is not the problem, says Mr Spiers—rather, it is the fault of the state for not building enough homes itself.

Here is the key paragraph:

What you do not mention is that when this country built enough houses, for 35 years after the war, the public sector built more than half of them. Private sector supply has remained fairly steady throughout the postwar period, allowing for the economic cycle, but public finance now goes to paying for housing benefit rather than building homes. This is why we now have a housing crisis. Any government that is serious about tackling it should focus on shortcomings in the UK industry and the lack of public funding, rather than fixating on planning.
To make a couple of points:

First, raising the period when the public sector built so many houses is disingenuous. You can bet a spectacular amount of money that if any government or council were to try to build a lot of new socially-rented houses in the countryside, the CPRE would be the first to protest, complaining about the loss of lovely/important pesticide-covered fields.

Second and more importantly, while the public sector did build a lot of homes in the post-war era, they did so often by demolishing pre-existing houses. Often, the idea was not to increase the density of population in an area but to decrease it: whole streets of densely-packed Victorian terraces were demolished to be replaced by modern flats surrounded by parkland. In the 1960s and 1970s house-building routinely passed 300,000 units per year but the net addition to the stock was far less (see this chart here). The exception was in the creation of new overspill towns—places like Harlow and Milton Keynes, built on pretty green fields and connected up with brand new motorways cutting through the countryside. A quick search of “CPRE new towns” or “CPRE motorways” reveals what Mr Spiers would likely think of any such proposals today.

The truth is that Britain’s housing crisis is almost entirely about the use of land, which is determined largely by planning policy. A hectare of agricultural land on the edge of Oxford may cost £6,000-£10,000. Similar land with planning permission can be worth £4 million. That huge gap is what encourages land speculation, and so creates many of the problems Mr Spiers raises about the state of the building industry. Since only a small amount of developable land is released each year by councils, developers compete entirely at the point when they are buying land, rather than at the point when they are selling the homes they build. The firms that survive are the ones with the best access to finance, rather than the firms which build the nicest houses.

If Mr Spiers must be satisfied, there is a solution to Britain’s (or better yet, London’s) housing crisis which does not involve building on green fields. But it wouldn’t be easy. Typical “brownfield” land is expensive to build on and in any case, usually in the wrong place. Whacking speculators with lots of punitive taxation may help to release a little more land, but not much. The only solution that might actually make much of a difference involves demolishing lots of existing homes and building new ones on the land freed up. Large parts of inner-London are not very densely populated: redevelopment could massively increase the number of people who can comfortably squeeze into the capital. Unlike suburban development, that would reduce the pressure on roads and public transport and make people's lives easier by allowing them to live closer to their work.

The problem with this plan is that it would require a huge interventionist state willing to force people out of their homes, concrete over their gardens and create entirely new neighbourhoods on the land freed up. To satisfy demand, it would have to do it quickly: in London, we would have to demolish perhaps 50,000 homes a year. People would be—rightly—outraged. The scope for corruption or simple stupidity would be huge. Just look at the legacy of the last time we did it in the 1950s and 1960s. While some social housing built then is extremely pleasant, far too much was in the form of grim, cheaply-built concrete blocks surrounded by wasted scrubland. Even if it was well constructed, surveys repeatedly show that—to the frustration of the new urbanist planners—what most British people still want is a house in a suburb with a garden.

Meanwhile, the green-belt land we are protecting from the bulldozers is mostly not gorgeous countryside, but scrubby lettuce fields, golf courses and pony paddocks. Its protection is an enormous subsidy to various rich people—golfers, horse-owners and farmers—at the expense of people who would like to buy new homes. To a reasonable extent, it doesn’t even protect countryside from development, but rather pushes new house-building out to places like the Chilterns, which though enormously beautiful, is not in the green-belt and so is less protected from development.

The only realistic solution is to force the release of more land for housing where it is most needed: on the edge of cities, and particularly in London's green belt. Planning policy is the primary determinant of what land is released for house-building, and so yes, planning is the problem.",null,0,null,1421144559,null,0,false,0,cnng631,null,t3_2s8efp,null,t1_cnng631,null,t1_cnnfwot,null,null,null,1424903624,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

An £800m plan to develop one the largest brownfield sites in London has run into a storm of local opposition, with campaigners branding the proposals “alien”, “clumsy” and likely to ruin a historic part of the city.
The Bishopsgate Goodsyard project in Shoreditch, east London, comprises more than 1,450 new homes, 600,000 sq ft of office space and 5½ acres of new “public realm”, including a raised park, as well as other facilities. Hammerson and Ballymore Group, the joint developers, say it will also create around 5,000 jobs.

“Our vision, which has received welcome support from the Mayor of London, will provide vital new homes and thousands of new jobs to London, as well as London’s first fully elevated publicly accessible park with city views,” a spokesperson for the developers said.
Much of the site has been derelict for more than 50 years and the proposal comes as London suffers from an acute housing shortage. But the development has faced criticism on a number of fronts, making it a significant and emblematic planning battle that has riled local campaigners.

The scale of the proposals, in particular, has been controversial. Plans for several residential blocks — two with more than 40 storeys — have been attacked as being at odds with the character of Shoreditch, which over the past few years has become one of London’s trendiest districts.

The East End Preservation Society has called them “dramatically out of scale with the surrounding area” and adds they will block out the light to two-fifths of nearby buildings.

Shoreditch’s transformation had been “allowed to happen by an organic process using cheap office space for creative start-ups and small businesses”, said Will Palin, who chairs the EEPS. “It has grown in the way a big, clumsy, homogenous development would not allow.”

Meg Hillier, MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, said she was concerned that if the development ended up dominated by big businesses and expensive homes, it would “smother” the area’s character. “Shoreditch has grown organically thanks to its creative people — in digital, fashion and the media — because there was property available for small businesses to start, grow and stay.”

She added: “If you focus on luxury flats you make it . . . a ghost city, not a tech city.” Ms Hillier said she intended to meet the developers this week.
In addition, the proposals include a 10 per cent affordable housing allocation, significantly below the 50 per cent target provision in the two boroughs the development straddles: Tower Hamlets and Hackney.

A few minutes walk from the City of London to the south and Tech City to the west, the Goodsyard is flanked by small-scale shops and low-rise residential buildings, as well as a jumble of fences and walls along its southern side.
Running through the site is the Braithwaite Viaduct, a grade-II listed structure built in 1840; the yard also encompasses several other listed structures and conservation areas, though much of the goods yard was demolished in 2003 to make way for Shoreditch High Street railway station.

The Victorian Society says the plans would cause “substantial harm to the setting of a large number of designated heritage assets” and has called for the boroughs to reject them.

However, Hammerson and Ballymore said the project would allow “local creative industries to shape the new commercial space, and the restoration of the historic Braithwaite railway arches through a unique retail offer”.
The developers added: “We remain committed to continuing to engage with all stakeholders to deliver a scheme that maximises benefits to the community and contributes to the important growth of London.”

A spokesperson for Boris Johnson, mayor of London, said: “The mayor is broadly supportive of the scheme but he has asked Hackney and Tower Hamlet councils to carry out further work on several aspects of the proposal, including looking at the amount of affordable housing offered, the amount of employment space and the scale of one of the plots that is proposed.”

Planning officers at Hackney and Tower Hamlets are due to make their recommendations in the next few weeks before the councils vote on the scheme. A person close to the process said there were “significant concerns” with the development.

Mr Palin agreed the site needed regeneration and redevelopment but called the proposals “tacky and exploitative”, adding: “There needs to be a robust engagement by the local authorities to test [the developers’] assertions . . . and not just accept that this is the only scheme that is going to make any money.”

Support for Bishopsgate Goodsyard may depend on whether you think it is closer, geographically and spiritually, to the City of London or the diverse neighbourhoods of Shoreditch, Spitalfields and Brick Lane. Over the past two centuries, the area has known good times and bleak poverty.

Bishopsgate Station was built in 1840 for passenger traffic until it was repurposed for freight 40 years later, handling goods from Britain’s eastern ports.
The Charles Booth poverty map of 1898-99 illustrates the social range in the surrounding area. To the west and southwest — on the border with the City — were middle-class, well-to-do households; to the north, east and southeast came a mix of “vicious, semi-criminal”, “poor” and “very poor”.

In 1964 a huge fire left the site mostly derelict. Much of what survived was knocked down in 2003 to make way for Shoreditch High Street station and the East London line.

Today, the site is hemmed in by four conservation areas, with a fifth to the north, and surrounded by listed structures, such as the former forecourt wall and gates to Shoreditch High Street and the Braithwaite viaduct.

The Victorian Society, a charity championing Victorian and Edwardian buildings, says the site is “surrounded by a number of east London’s most important and interesting conservation areas. The [goodsyard] complex as a whole is of enormous character, resonance and interest”.

These are a few of their oppositions to the plan of building more homes:

 
&gt;1. This is a flood plain.  Flooding is common and residents will find their homes more likely to flood as farmland is replaced with concrete. 

Most new builds made in front of the Thames barrier are designed to cope with flooding (no home on first two floors for example). This is a design problem.

&gt;2. The sewerage system cannot cope, it was created for a small community without a flooding problem. Already raw sewage flows with very heavy rain.  

So does London, but its being fixed. Rather than see this as a reason not to build, see it as a reason to improve maybe?

&gt;3. The primary school is full therefore any new residents will not find a school place. ALthough discussions have taken plance, no plan is agreed and financed to resolve this. MBC should ensure infrastructure is in place BEFORE planning consent is granted.

Somewhat legitimate point but new homes have to be built somewhere and so do schools. Maybe if there were new homes it might give the council a concrete reason to build a new one. Whats the point in building a school without knowing if it will be filled? 

&gt;4. There are insufficient secondary school places to accommodate new residents.

Last point again.

&gt;6. MBC does not recognise the necessity to demand open spaces are retained in the heart of the community suitable for an increased population. MBC prefers to pack housing developments alongside one another with tiny ""amenity spaces"", being ponds and narrow patches of flooding land they can't do anything about.

Its in the middle of the fucking countryside. How much more open space do you want?

&gt;7. MBC would conflict with government advice by allowing solar power stations on productive farmland, apparently not raising an eyebrow when applicants try to claim land is barely productive.

This links in with another dispute where they don't want a local Solar farm because it will, laugh along with me, ruin views and lead to more traffic. They love this ""productive farmland"" line but i clearly a farmer has thought it more economically productive to make electricity than grow stuff.

The even bigger hypocrysisy is that in this part of Kent you see polytunnels everywhere, great swathes of Kent covered in plastic. Any outcry? No.

Mortgages are special kinds of debt that will hound you forever so there is no way for the over priced supply to return to the market at a corrected price. In fact the banks can by law stop you from selling up when in negative equity. This leads to a strange phenomenon which works counter to how markets operate. Supply actually decreases during negative equity, forcing prices back up. This is one of the mechanisms that stops house prices from correcting.

The US has a better system. A bankrupt person can simply walk away. In this model price corrections occur more naturally. A far larger number of over priced houses are returned to the market more quickly and banks are forced to take the loss on the chin rather than trying to put it off.

Honestly there is a lot to admire about US bankruptcy laws in general. The main reason we don't adopt them is they'd allow the housing market to correct itself.",null,0,null,1421147294,null,0,false,0,cnngpbc,null,t3_2s8efp,null,t1_cnngpbc,null,t1_cnngala,null,null,null,1424903375,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

I used to live near there (grew up in Farnborough and Camberley, then lived in Reading) and it's not a particularly fun place, as one of the above posters mentions, there's not a lot going on culturally- mostly due to the proximity of London. 

What sort of things do you enjoy doing? 

I'd avoid Basingstoke itself, Woking is also pretty rubbish and perhaps achieves the feat of being marginally more depressing than Basingstoke due to it's haunted shopping centres and grubby concrete. 

Guildford is a bit nicer (it had a bangin' laser quest circa 1996) and at least has The Boiler Room venue, for the moment at least. I think some douchebag is trying to turn it into flats for other douchebags. It's also pretty expensive to live there, but that's the price you pay for living in a town with more than one Nandos. The river is quite nice when it's not flooded. 

I lived in Camberley for a good few years. It did have a good record shop, which now mostly sells Slipknot pencil cases. If you like ageing crooner Des O'Connor, you're in luck as he regularly seems to materialise at the civic centre. The pubs aren't great (Though one did have a giant connect four at one point), though the Agincourt club is a hoot if you love nu-metal songs from around the millennial cusp. Almost all of my old friends from school (I'm 33) have moved away, me included as the area didn't have much to offer us, and was expensive to live. 

Winchester has a lot of interesting history (it was the capital at one point) and some nice buildings, and you get some alright gigs at the Railway Inn. Rail links are alright too, as are most places in the region. (Though Camberley's are rubbish!)

null,false,AGamerDraws,null,null,null,"Thank you for this, it is something I keep in the back of my mind all the time, however the issue is a lot more complicated than just the raw numbers. 

If you are interested here are a few of the factors (skip this paragraph if you don't care haha): First few years the business basically did nothing, I set it up when I was 17 whilst still studying at school just so that I could self publish my own graphic novels and I really didn't know what I was doing (no business background). It wasn't until I was unable to go to uni that I decided to try this properly so I used my uni funds to purchase the first Mac, a high end scanner and all the full Adobe suite. I have since seen the business grow to a level where I would normally be able to say _""I can afford this, I will have the money by May""_ However, my biggest money making comic con has recently changed it's rules and now what I will walk out of there with is a _sort of_ unknown. I know the base amount i'll make, but I don't know if it will be around what I usually make. This has made 2015 look a lot more unstable and I can no longer guarantee that I will have that big upfront cash anymore. I have several big plans to revamp the business, I just completed an accounting course and I've started doing real budgeting for the first time in my life so I feel like I can rescue it and excel forward, however as it isn't a known figure I just can't guarantee it and need to think of back up plans.

I have very carefully considered the exact machine I need and this really is the one. I don't just work at a desk so I really do need something portable, I need something powerful, I need something that all my software will carry over to. I don't, however, need the highest spec Macbook Pro, so I am looking into the refurbished models so that I can get a 2012 to 2013 model which will have a slight discount on it.

Thank you for commenting, I am keeping this in mind and it is a realistic thing to discuss.

Did you ever hear of people who like, you know, leave home? There are no cosy communities of Jews or Muslims or Christians; these are the sad illusion of an out of touch elite.

Imams, Rabbis and Priests can preach whatever the fuck they are told to but in the end their influence is tenuous at best.

The notion that communities 'control' their members is a huge illusion.

If you become so disenfranchised that you decide to go train with some terror group, I think it's highly likely you may have done this without asking permission from your folks or your friendly local god rep.

The danger in the statement is that there is an implication that parents somehow tacitly approve the actions of those who go to join these extremist groups. Maybe again in deluded Tory minds where parents were better in the 50s (and there was no crime!) this sort of thing is real.

At no point did I say they were the only negative impact. Of course the stewards cause problems but fans who have come from overseas also contribute to the lack of atmosphere. You confirm this by staying that the atmosphere is great at away games. These are the game that only the local supporters usually get tickets to. Just to emphasise, at no point did I say that foreign supporters are worse than local supporters in any way other than the fact that many of them cannot really contribute to the atmosphere. I'm not saying foreign people are bad. I'm not saying I dislike them as people in anyway. I'm not saying they have any less of a right to see Chelsea play than someone who lives on Fulham road. They just aren't very vocal and are one of the various contributing factors to the lack of noise we sometimes have at the bridge.

Edit: Your statistics are also way off.  The Stadium's capacity is 41,837. You are suggesting that 72% are season ticket holders. That's fair enough but where does this 11% come from?  72+11=83. Are you saying that 17% of tickets are allocated to away fans? That would mean about 7100 away fans. The Shed end only has a capacity of 6,831 so this is clearly wrong. In reality we only allocate 1,500 or 3,000 away tickets for most games. The exception is the FA cup when, as we did against Watford, the entire shed is occasionally given. But the average number of away fans will be around 3000. This is about 7%. So closer to 20% are sold to the public. That is double what you said.

CLUB: Tottenham

FACTS: Has been with Spurs since he was 11

Winks (as we all know) has recently signed a professional deal with the club. The talented midfielder is highly regarded at White Hart Lane and is tipped for a big future at the north London club. He is an England under 18's regular and is pushing for the England under 21's - and is likely to make the step up sooner rather than later. Reminds me very much of a player in the Tom Carroll mold, but with a MUCH MUCH higher potential. He was featuring in our under 18 side just as he turned 16, and was earning rave reviews in the process. Rave reviews actually doesn't do him justice - if he continues to improve as quickly as he is now I would NOT be surprised to see him make the first team both for Tottenham &amp; England. In the matches I've seen him play in, he is clearly on another level to everyone around him and has been training with the first team.

Many fans who have had the opportunity to watch Winks regularly in the under21's describes him as a ''different class'. His vision, passing, reading of the game and technique are his best attributes - he reminds me of a young Paul Scholes in that respect.

from SkySports/Wyscout Tottenham have seen a host of young prospects propelled into the first-team squad this season. One of those is Harry Winks, who many think could be the next big breakthrough at White Hart Lane.

The youngster who hails from Hemel Hempstead has been linked with Spurs since before he was a teenager, first linking up with them when he was 11.

Winks has progressed well through the ranks and was playing for the Spurs Under-18 side as he turned 16. England were also quick to recognise his progress and he has been a key member of the national set-up and has shone in recent months for the Under-18s. Winks is a deep-lying midfielder - who loves to play football, which has made him a firm favourite with Spurs' coaching staff. Comfortable on the ball - his main weapon is his vision and his ability to pick a pass. He has a good engine and gets up and down the field well, but he likes to keep his shape and is not often dragged out of position. It is not surprising Winks is knocking on the first-team door at Spurs, given the sense of maturity he brings to his game.

Here's a clip of him nearly scoring a obviously intentional ridiculous FK...or not. He's got great technique and takes our Set Pieces from what I can see.

Not daft at all, we need to be able to trust people to use the powers we give them responsibly, and that is the problem. Most people probably have similar ideas about what powers the state should have, but wildly different ideas about how much the people in charge now will abuse the power they have. 

I think that most people do want the state to be able to intercept communications made by terrorists, but do not trust the people in charge not to abuse those powers. Therefore it is not the powers being suggested being argued against, but the people who would use them.

No matter what happens between now and then, I will always hold Frank in the highest possible regard. He was instrumental in elevating our club to its current level of success, you should never forget that.

&gt; The point is, it isn't the same mechanism.

Well yes I see what you're getting at - doing direct gene splicing involves a different set of actions, tools and processes than cross-breeding via the garden. The reason any of this works though is genes. And manipulation of genes is what both techniques do. This is a silly argument though. It's like arguing that a novel written on a computer is fundamentally different from one created by hand-writing. Both achieve the same thing - a novel.

&gt; This wouldn't happen naturally.

Well either human intervention is natural or it's not.
If human intervention is natural then this has happened naturally.
If human intervention is not natural then has happened unnaturally, just like cauliflowers did.

Of course you might want to say that only some human intervention is natural - maybe selective breeding via gardening is OK, but GM isn't.
Why might that be the case though? Humans - as we originally evolved - didn't do gardening. We invented/discovered it about 20,000 years ago.

They bought up dozens of streets of terraces with in some cases quite a lot of resistance in some of these houses there are families whove lived for generations or in other cases just people whove lived there decades. Many were student or low quality lets though which had been neglected by landlords and in poor condition.

So the council bought them up at market rate plus a bit (note that these were at the cheaper end of the market in one if thecheapest areas in thecountry to buy so people weren't necessarily flush with other options - another reason for resistance) eventually enacting CPOs to remove the last stubborn few. Meanwhile a while economic crash happened and when the land became available No one was interested in building there. Phase 2 and 3 were to follow but for years no one knew if they would meaning people were reluctant to invest in their homes/lets if they were just going to be bought up and knocked down.

They've knocked down some and left others standing derelict, internals gutted and abandoned. The rest of the area is suffering

So this Brownfield site is there and it needs development.  It needs new homes built on it. It's ready. Building could start quickly. I'm sure they are aching to grant planning permission.  But no one is interested.  Our house prices are too low so we can go rot. We already had low house prices. They've fallen year on year for the last 8 years. We saw no sign of last year's price bubble but is scary to think that the bubble bursting could still have a knock on effect on us.

I guess I got a bit off topic there at times TL;DR is I guess that some places have another problem I that its just not profitable enough to build there.

They aren't a single issue party (although saving the NHS is definitely their main concern), they have a coherent platform to the left of Labour (not hard after Blair). A Robin Hood tax, anti-lobbyist, anti-tax avoidance, all good stuff. A lot of their candidates seem to be retired doctors and their policies mention 'evidence based' a lot, which is nice (and believable, coming from doctors rather than politicians). Very technocratic.

I'll definitely be voting for their candidate. I'm also going to let go of my membership with the Lib Dems. I didn't know Clegg stated outright he'd prefer to enter a coalition with the Tories than Labour, I felt pretty betrayed when that happened. I should have read their manifesto before voting for them, but hey that's what I'm doing now with the NHAP!

I hope they get a good result in the elections and shake things up a little. I'm sick of the UK goosestepping towards the right.",null,0,null,1421152884,null,0,false,0,cnnhzej,null,t3_2s9xl4,null,t1_cnnhzej,null,t3_2s9xl4,null,null,null,1424902778,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

To the end of drawing attention to the fact that the individual they worship was a genocidal paedophile and it is right to question why they would hold such a person up as a paragon of virtue. Muslims can be good people or bad people but holding someone like Mohamed as the personification of righteousness can objectively only be bad.

&gt; Ridiculing someone's faith is almost the same as ridiculing them anyway.

Is it? If people believe in religion or conspiracy theories or other fairy tales why is that deserving of respect? They might otherwise be a great person but that doesn't mean that they get a pass for believing in nonsense. You argue that it isn't going to make the world a better place but the opposite is true, ignorance should be challenged and doing so makes the world a better place as more people see the objective truth.

You've got to remember that the whole field of physcology and psychotherapy is theoretical and for that reason the boundaries between pseudoscience and science are highly debatable. Which in itself is highly debatable. For example I had a degree course physcology interview with a woman who is renowned in the field of psychotherapy and the mere mention that I'd studied CBT had her spitting at me that: WE DO NOT TEACH CBT HERE!!



I mean she got seriously upset. Upset to the point where I just thought there's no way I'm studying here, that's just closed minded thinking. So even recognised psychological practices obviously have psychologists and psychotherapists  arguing among themselves. 

However the main issue with NLP is that it attracts a lot of cranks, extremists and new age types who take that theory and turn it into almost a cult pseudo-religion and for that reason alone it's never going to recognised.

The past five years has not provided an environment auspicious for making a fortune. The financial crisis pitched Britain into its worst recession and weakest recovery since the war. Living standards dropped further than at any time since the reign of Queen Victoria.

Yet for some these have been years of plenty. House prices, particularly in the southeast of England, have barrelled steadily higher: in total, Britain’s housing stock has grown in value by almost a trillion pounds. Most of this has accrued either to private sector landlords or to those lucky enough already to own a house.

It is slightly unreal when a nation’s wealth grows as a result of its citizens swapping houses for ever higher prices. But there is nothing illusory about the divisions this creates. Rents have risen remorselessly and now swallow around two-fifths of the income of private tenants. These tend to be much younger than homeowners, who in contrast have benefited from cheaper mortgages since the recession.

It is a mistake to call this faulty monetary policy. Had the Bank of England taken a different course house prices may have fallen but so too would have incomes, with ruinous effect. Nor is it easy to pin the blame on overseas buyers; while London’s shinier developments are often snapped up by the global elite, there are not enough transactions to explain a problem that runs to billions of pounds.
Instead what lies behind the UK’s chronically expensive housing is a straightforward matter of supply and demand. The biggest problem is supply. Britain’s newly built houses are the smallest in western Europe. A growing proportion are crowded with six or more people. Yet fiscal policy is far more effective in supporting house prices than building houses. Landlords can write off mortgage interest as a taxable cost, and there is nothing to pay on primary residences that soar in value. Billions of pounds of housing benefit help prop up private sector rents.

Coalition policy has been of doubtful use. The Help to Buy mortgage guarantee benefited its direct recipients but may make houses less affordable for millions of others. Allowing buy-to-let landlords to benefit from Funding for Lending, a vast credit subsidy, probably had a similar effect. Both schemes were launched at speed, while a much trumpeted guarantee for house construction stayed stuck in the pipeline.

The government showed more mettle in wrestling with the planning system, risking the wrath of environmental groups determined to defend every last scrap of green. It was right to: less than one-tenth of Britain is built on, and the planning system provides a daunting roadblock to the aspiring housebuilder. It may be a coincidence that price rises have been concentrated in government-held seats. Yet the government’s early reforming courage dissipated as the recession receded and an election drew near. A bold idea for letting local authorities auction off development land was allowed to wither on the vine.

There is much more that a determined government could do. The Treasury should put under the microscope every penny of support given to home ownership. It should be up to local authorities freely to determine property taxes. The planning system must be made to listen less to comfortable homeowners and more to those trapped in cramped accommodation.

The politics of building more houses is as tortuous as the economics is clear. But the current state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue. What Britain needs is a government brave enough to trumpet the virtue of falling house prices, and to make it happen.

No. It's just not going to happen. People see their primary allegiance to their family, not to the UK government. And this is by no means unique to Muslims.

I'm sorry you think that the Middle East issues have no bearing on what angers people into action.  When a young Jewish kid emigrates to Israel and joins the army his or her parents proudly post their photos on facebook. Send a young Arab kid to the Palestinian front line and he is a terrorist. Don't these values seem somewhat out of wack with each other? The UK has a lot of blood on its hands for the ME and has never owned up or apologised for it. Now it wants Muslims to suddenly open up and report on their own people. Sadly people have long memories when it comes to this sort of thing. It may be recent for Europe but if you've ever spent any real time in the Middle East you realise how fucked up that whole region was by British (and French) actions no more than 50 years ago.

Also, what would you define as a terrorist? Some kid who gets religion and reads the Q'uran and Hadith suddenly? Among some of my friends and family this would be considered very worthy. When do they cross the line? Would you even know before it was too late?

If you want a community to co-operate with you then what will you offer them in return? Just brushing off some of the core issues that Muslims feel strongly about and then expecting them to collaborate with you seems a little one-sided.

null,false,THREE_EDGY_FIVE_ME,cnty-expat,Expat,null,"&gt; holding someone like Mohamed as the personification of righteousness can objectively only be bad

The concept of what is ""objective good and bad"" is not quite as common as you think when the entire human race is put into perspective. That's the way things unfortunately are, and the sooner you accept that most of humanity doesn't share your concept of logic, the sooner you'll find yourself a lot less hopelessly annoyed at the world. At least, that was my experience.

Yes, I agree with the actual view you have. But ridicule is simply not a good method of persuasion. And yes, if you say to a person ""Your belief is stupid"", you're almost directly calling the person themself stupid. Put yourself in the situation; if someone aggressively and humiliatingly ridicules beliefs that you have held dear for your whole life, are you gonna respect that person and want to to actually listen to and think properly over the points they made?

The usual result is that one is simply annoyed at that person and inclined to dismiss their arguments. People are fundamentally illogical and emotional creatures, and ridicule often just hardens the reciever *against* the view being presented. 

&gt; why is that deserving of respect

You don't have to respect their belief. I'm just saying there's no point going out of your way to insult it. There's a big difference between ""not respecting something"" and ""actively making an effort to show great disrespect"".

&gt; ignorance should be challenged

Okay! Yes! I've said that myself several times now! But what I'm trying to explain is that ""discussing, critiquing, and debating viewpoints"" is not the same as going *""hey muslim, your prophet was a filthy paedo and it's terrible and stupid that you follow this faith""*.

&gt; It was indeed, and yet when we look at why it was allowed to go on for so long we begin to see the importance of defending freedom of speech.

I disagree. Clearly there's a difference between the two because they are achieved via a different set of physical actions from one another, but they achieve the same thing - a plant that didn't exist before - and they do it by manipulating genes.

That is the average pay. If you look at lower earners specifically the picture is less clear. Also worth noting that CPI excludes housing. 

The Conservatives poll ahead on the economy but if they go around telling people they are better off then they are in trouble. That is not how people feel. Besides, obvious which narrative will appeal to those on low-income (by May 2015).

As you can see a *lot* of stuff is said, more than likely most of it is shite.

&gt;but with the means to play why not go for some bigger-money targets? 

1) They're big gambles. Torres' £50m, Carroll's £35m etc. Sometimes they don't work and that's a *big* investment risk to put all your eggs into. 

2) Other clubs want them. Why go to Spurs who are chasing CL when you could go to a CL team already?

3) Wages are a killer. Spurs are in the gap between the lower teams and the elite, big money teams. [This](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/may/01/premier-league-club-accounts-debt-wages) shows this. Why go to Spurs on ~£75k/week when you can get £100k+ at other teams?

4) Players. Again tied to ""bigger"" clubs, big players attract others - if you had a chance to play with the likes of Ronaldo, Modric, Bale, James Rod., Kroos etc would you not?

5) Titles - why go to a team that's not regularly winning silverware if you're being offered one that is?

6) More than likely they're already going to be in a good position. For example Lacazette - he *will* be highly sought after this summer, he'll have the usual choice of clubs, large fee, wages etc. But why leave Lyon for Spurs? At this moment in time they're already in a CL place - they're leading Ligue 1. Why drop down from that?

Bony is a good example of this. From Swansea to Man City, his wages are now reportedly 6 figures per week, some speculate £200k/week. Why join Spurs over City? They're winning titles, in CL, have *very* good players (Silva, Nasri, Toure, Aguero etc), can pay more for his fee and wages and are currently second in the league.",null,0,null,1421154665,null,0,false,0,cnnihmk,null,t3_2s8w8x,null,t1_cnnihmk,null,t3_2s8w8x,null,null,null,1424902529,null,8,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,8,null

So very generally the way it works is that you pay full price for everything up front and can then, when it comes time to do your self assessment deduct all your expenses (such as this) from your earnings and that becomes your taxable amount. So no you don't get any money off the purchase and you will still need to pay VAT (unless you are VAT registered which you won't be).

Honestly I would very strongly advise speaking to an accountant or doing a lot of reading up on this. There is a ton of stuff that is tax deductible, from home office costs to milage. At the very least roughly work out what you expect to earn this tax year and then the tax bracket that will put you in, then start putting aside 20-45% (depending on bracket) of everything that you earn aside to pay for it.

Also keep all your receipts and a record of milage travelled and every expense you occur in the course of business. The vast majority is tax deductible. For a couple of hundred quid you can get an accountant to do your tax return and they will work it all out for you, as long as you have kept all your receipts and paperwork :)

I miss Australian supermarkets though. Having grown up in Australia, I didn't realise how multicultural the food is until I moved to England. I spent ages trying to get some decent rye bread and smoked sausage, but that stuff is pretty normal in Australia because of the huge influx of Eastern Europeans after WWII.  Similar for Asian food. It's not unusual to have a Japanese takeaway in a small country town.

England has a much wider variety of sweets and cakes and other ~~junk~~ snack food, but Australia has a better variety of meats, seafood, fruit and vegetables. IMHO.

Takeaway food in Australia offers a lot more fresh food options, and fish'n'chip shops usually also offer calamari, prawns, oysters, mussels, baby octopus, and scallops. 

Seafood is big in the both the UK and Australia, but they're different. In Australia, you don't get those crab and prawn kiosks all over the seaside towns - which I really love! I think it's something that could do well in Australia. Eating hot fish and chips, on the beach, is very much a thing to do in Australia.

No regrets moving to the UK though, it's nice to have a change.

We're getting into the realms of philosophy here but I think it is safe to say that doing harm to others who have not done harm to you is intrinsically wrong and having sex with those not able to consent is also intrinsically wrong.

&gt; Yes, I agree with the actual view you have. But ridicule is simply not a good method of persuasion.

Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. The issue isn't whether it is a good measure or not, the issue is whether we should be allowed to resort to it or not. Personally I feel that ridicule can be quite effective, particularly in so far as religion is concerned. I'd rather listen to the late Greater Hitchens espouse on religion than on politics.

&gt; if someone aggressively and humiliatingly ridicules beliefs that you have held dear for your whole life, are you gonna respect that person and want to to actually listen to and think properly over the points they made?

Personally? Yes. I believe I hold the views I do because they are objectively right and that is why I am always happy to challenge them and change them if I can find better alternatives. Now I accept your premise that religious people may be less likely to do this (by virtue of believing in a religion) but they may also want to prove they are right and so research issues in more detail to reach better conclusions if their beliefs are challenged.

&gt; There's a big difference between ""not respecting something"" and ""actively making an effort to show great disrespect"".

Absolutely, I agree. And I don't have a big problem with religion per se or even Islam in particular. That said, Islam does have specific problems associated with it and as such runs into conflict with democracy more often than other religions seem to. When that happens I reserve the right to call it out and to defend other's rights to do so as well. 

&gt; what I'm trying to explain is that ""discussing, critiquing, and debating viewpoints"" is not the same as going ""hey muslim, your prophet was a filthy paedo and it's terrible and stupid that you follow this faith"".

That is a somewhat semantic argument but even if I were to accept your premise the facts of whether Mohamed was a genocidal paedophile or not aren't really in dispute and as such it is legitimate to question his suitability as a role model whether through satire or polite discussion. Nowhere and under no circumstances should satirisation not be allowed.

&gt; And do you think caricatures of the Prophet would have solved the problem?

Who can say? Perhaps they might have caused some to look at their faith more and either turn against it or consider it differently? It may have made some difference, it may have made no difference, but again that doesn't justify being prevented from criticising Islam.

&gt; Do you think it would've helped Rotherham if we had distributed leaflets with ""Islam is stupid and Muhammad was a paedo"" on them?

Plus they both left last summer, and the summer was so shit for us fans I think anyone who left in that period (apart from Lambert) is kind of tainted with that anger and frustration.

What you do this tax year has no bearing on the amount of money you can put into an ISA in the next tax year.  You get £15k this year, and £15k next year and so on on (until the rules or the allowance change).

However if you what you're really asking is ""can I pay money into an ISA in this tax year and then move it to another ISA next year without that effecting the amount I can add to a new ISA next year?"" then the answer is yes.

You can transfer money from one ISA to another as much as you like without it counting against your annual allowance (providing you do it by completing a transfer form - never just withdraw cash and redeposit it because that does count against your annual allowance).",null,0,null,1421156363,null,0,false,0,cnnj1d8,null,t3_2s9rp1,null,t1_cnnj1d8,null,t1_cnni46a,null,null,null,1424902273,null,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

""Aww, you're just like Rumpelstiltskin"" I replied with a smile.

She gave me a weird look and a half-smile before signing for the parcel and I went on my merry way.

It was about an hour later I realised the princess trapped in the tower was Rapunzel and Rumpelstiltskin was a hideous troll.

&gt;Defining legal obligations between investors and governments is within the best interests of a country and its citizens because it attracts investment.


FDI is already a huge part of the globalised world. What is wrong with the current model? 

&gt;&amp;gt;Having an arbitrary set of rules

&gt;They are not arbitrary.

They are devised in a collective manner, with no intent to reflect national considerations. The winners will be corporations, their lobbyists and the politicians who are in their pockets. 

&gt;&amp;gt;takes away the individual sovereignty of the member countries to make their ability to make their own decisions as to what is acceptable in business.

&gt;Isds typically allows any reasoned law change to take place without requiring compensation. Unreasonable law change example; the nationalistic and borderline racist policy of imposing additional restrictions on foreign buisnesses without rational justification.

We don't even have one legal system within the UK, but you advocate a universal law for business??? 

&gt;

&gt;The number of Democracies with the right to self assembly has nearly doubled in the last 30 years, with the biggest increases from 1989- 1995.

You are looking at things from bottom up. For those of us who aspire to live in a country with a first world approach to workers' rights, it is clear that the working man had been under attack since the rise of Thatcherism. 

Corporations want to exploit the resources of any country they can, whether those resources be a downtrodden workforce or natural resources. That is why they push for this harmonisation of laws to bring us all down to the lowest common denominator. The inevitable end is that we become no better off than the Bangladeshi sweatshop workers, except that Gap and Apple will no longer need to pretend that such conditions are errant outliers, because we will all be living in those conditions - all except the captains of industry.

If you put that in an ISA at 2% (I know, that's optimistic) then you'll earn £200.

If you put the same amount in a bank account getting 2% interest then you'll get £180. Obviously the savings will increase year on year, with each £10k you put in.

Also worth noting that there's no limit to how much you can have in an ISA that's gaining interest tax free, but there is a limit to how much you put in it in a year (currently 15k)

Wait, did you just suggest that the action to remove Saddam from Kuwait is the west's first incursion in the middle east? 

The 2003 invasion was our FOURTH invasion of Iraq in just 100 years. We've dominated the region since the fall of the Ottoman Empire in WW1. Are you really this unaware of the history?

&gt; the one where the west invaded to stop Saddam killing muslims

Nonsense. He was a US ally when he was killing Muslims. They provided the satellite intel to enable it. Europe provided the chemicals and delivery systems. We knew full well what he was up to and [we backed him all the way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halabja_chemical_attack#International_sources_for_technology_and_chemical_precursors) as he was our guy. Shit, the US [installed him in the first place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein#Rise_to_power), in the 50s he was a CIA assassin! Then following [a misunderstanding with the US Ambassador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Glaspie#Meetings_with_Saddam_Hussein) he went too far by attacking another country ran by one of our other guys and fell out of favour. 

We invaded to capture the [5th largest oil reserves on the planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_reserves_in_Iraq), the exact same reason we invaded every other time. At least during [WW1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamian_campaign) and [WW2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Iraqi_War) we were honest about our intentions!

&gt; Or are they the invasions that you think piss of the islamists?

Depends which ""Islamist"" you are talking about, contrary to the impression portrayed in our news they are different groups with different goals. Al Qaeda, the ones behind the WTC attacks, wanted to remove the US troops stationed in Mecca and to stop America backing the ruthless Saudi dictatorship along with other dictatorships which historically included Saddam Hussain and the Shah of Iran. 

There are various sects in middle-eastern / persian islam, most notably the Sunnis and Shias. These are analogous to our Protestant/Catholic divisions and like ours they have their own nationalist conflicts &amp; civil wars. When we invaded Iraq in 2003 [we banned the Sunnis from serving in the government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-Ba%27athification#Sunnis), giving the Shias total authority over the Sunni areas.

I can get way better Chinese in Australia (as I'm near Chatswood - a huge Chinese area) - in the UK you either have to be in London or go to a pricey restaurant.  Chinese takeaways can't really be considered Chinese food any more than Dominos is Italian.

I was in the UK in winter so the fresh produce was more limited. In Australia you can get way more, better Asian greens, and they're finally finding their way into mainstream supermarkets (still better value and quality at Asian stores though).

Deflation is a very tricky beast it can be very bad if caused by a lack of demand which is indicative of a weak economy and this is bad for all. Although it's the worst for asset owners i.e. the wealthy. If it's caused by increasing supply due to better productivity though it can be very good for the lower classes as it generally means wages will stay the same same or rise.

Right now I am of the belief that the deflation is being caused by increased production so wages should be fine and in fact so far they have. The issues are however in the Eurozone and specifically the countries that have resisted labour market reform, primarily France and Italy so deflation has been bad there as it has been caused by a lack of demand rather than increased production.

It does when that sale actually costs you £50k before you've even started. If a person with negative equity sells their home they'll need to make back that much before they can start buying a new house. The most likely result is that person will just end up defaulting on both debts. It is entirely in their interests to resist that sale.

Also competition is irrelevant. Once they have a mortgage it isn't as if a negative equity home owner can go to another bank. They don't have a contract with that bank. Obviously the bank is going to continue trading in whatever available trade there is on the market but they will each sit on the mortgages that are in negative equity. They actually do this, it isn't a conspiracy.

Incentives to report criminal activity are known as rewards I believe. Even if these were offered I don't imagine many would grass up their family or close friends to the UK establishment.

Let's bring it back home for a  moment:-

Suppose you catch your little bro' smoking weed. Do you smoke it with him? Tell him he's stupid? Tell your folks? Tell the police?

Supposing he starts dealing; then what are your options and likely actions? Oh, he'll grow out of it. He's just doing for the attention...

Supposing he joins a badass gang and starts carrying a blade or a gun; is it now too late for you because you are afraid what he or his mates might do to you if you intervene?

Your notion that someone would casually call in the authorities just at the right moment when someone they know is about to perpetrate some horrible crime is naive at best; deluded at worst. By the time our hypothetical little brother has got his gun it is way too late. Would you then kick yourself for not having grassed him up to Big Brother. And remember we are talking about the same big brother who most sane people are railing against for the massive invasion of privacy they have been perpetrating illegally for many years; but suddenly somehow these are the good guys if you happen to be a Muslim.

As far as I understand it's the network of people known as informants who keep the intelligence services fed with information (the quality of it is always going to be an issue though). The word informant isn't exactly a pleasant one to live with. The idea that you'd be treated as a hero for handing off information to MI5 or whoever is also a tad naive.

Politicians trying to devolve responsibility to anyone but themselves are probably the biggest problem by far in much of this.

Traditionally in the UK religion has always been a personal affair mainly a christian catholic kind of place ive never felt that anyone was persecuted for being religious or whatever on the same note religion has not governed the country and religion and state has been separate that's the country i live in and that's never gunna change i hope not anyway. If people believe that the UK should be run by Christians or the church i would object and i would fight against it. 

I will fight for freedom from religious control / Rule i will also fight for someones freedom to believe in whatever the fuck they want to as long as it doesn't impose on others. 

But i'm just me i'm no expert and my all means question what i say i welcome it without questioning discussing things we cannot learn i'm up for learning.

If this same civil servant gets a job in the private sector, we get all the income tax we did before, but without having to pay their wages. And, he's supporting himself, rather than being paid for by taxes from the private sector. Its Win Win Win for the government. 

This benefits the government budget and actually allows for greater spending on core services like the NHS, policing etc.

He's got a lot of positives for him: Long term thinking, has a clear system and goal, trust in youth, fitness, ain't afraid to drop senior players, etc.

But football-wise, we've been pretty awful I think.
 and so is the Chelsea game which seems to be a brilliant one-off.

Last 2 games, loss and draw to Crystal Palace and Burnley. Before that we've had many lucky wins - Leicester, Hull, Aston Villa. We've won all of those but the results are lying, we've played badly in most, and if it wasn't for some late Eriksen magic, Lloris MOTM performance (Leicester), a dubious red card (Hull) and a deflected free kick (Villa) we would have been way off the race for 4th by now. And these are some of the worst teams in the PL!

Also some late Eriksen magic against Swansea, in a game where we were mostly outplayed, and a miracle first half against Man U where we could have very easily gone to half time at 3-0 down (if it wasn't for Hugo, and Falcao finishing like Emile Heskey).

Pochettino's intentions are very positive but the team just aren't playing well. QPR game aside, we've never outclassed or hardly even outperformed lesser teams. We've been riding our luck, but when it wasn't there - like the last Palace and Burnley games - the results were poor and deserved.

In the first half of 2014 Apple received 179 account requests for the UK. They objected to 88 of them, no data was disclosed for 102 of them. 

76 requests received non-content data, and only 1 request received content data. 

All in all, only 43% of requests received any sort of data in return. Compare that with 77% for the US.

That said:

Imagine if mob of people approached employers, and told them ""We really hope that you are not employing any convicted criminals, or prisoners out on license, especially if the crime they were convicted of is rape.  If you do employ such people, we will boycott your business, and will boycott other businesses that you trade with, give you money, or otherwise support your business through sponsorship, etc."".   Apart from being ugly, in such a case, it would be very difficult to rehabilitate prisoners and gradually reintegrate them into society.

This is exactly what is happening in the Ched Evans case. The only difference is that it is happening online, and the name of the employer and felon is known by the mob.

Everyone is ""bitter"" about this let me finally put my two cents into this bullshit.

I don't care like Jose what Frank says, does, scores, shits whatever. He is now a Manchester City player. Regardless of how he got there, he is there and that is that.

Being a Chelsea fan, I want us to win the league. Being a Manchester City player Frank wants Man City to win the league.

Its that simple, otherwise he wouldn't have played or scored against us.

Its really a sense now of rivalry. Legend or not, he is now the enemy. He is playing in direct competition with our aims and ambitions. He could have easily gone back to MLS or frankly signed for another MLS team.

He chose that team knowing he'd be back in the Premier League.

And honestly I really don't give a shit and am sick of people bringing this up. We have one of the best midfielders in the world in Fabregas, and with his history with Lamps, there was no way they were going to be in the same squad.

Now the absolute joke would be Frank to be there NEXT season, making this post of his complete horseshit too.

I'm happy with my club letting him go, and bringing him Fabregas. He can score all he wants and take it up the arse from Toure for all I care. Even if they finish top with him helping, I don't care. I support Chelsea and thats that. No remorse, no ""he should have stayed"" as Fabregas in his prime beats an old aged Lampard, even if he is scoring. Plus he wasn't so good for us last season anyway. No regrets, up the Chels. End of.
