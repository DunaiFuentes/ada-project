I notice that Scandinavian Germanic and Benelux countries have high quality of life, standard of living and wellbeing among citizens fairly consistently, and they all either have a population of a couple of million people, or are split into regions of about that size for purposes of governing and representation. This seems to be an effective level at which to run many aspects of the country: you can get economies of scale and form fairly broad strategies, but aren't beyond the reach of the average person, so regions or sections of the population are less likely to get left behind.

If something is currently in short supply, does that justify short supply in the near future? What if a certain amount of that ""short supply"" (because we are talking about currency here after all...) is instrumental in increasing future ""supply"" to a degree greater than that achieved by the savings from not using that amount of the ""short supply""?

Austerity is and has always been deeply suspect as a concept - even  the austerity placed upon the UK during WWII was worth criticizing - no matter the evidence there for enacting it, if the quality of the information is substandard, it still deserves further investigation. There were serious PR issues - the Government and Royal Family still got their imported products to dine on and use around the house.

The reason why it is suspect is it's unique political properties: it allows a strange form of easy access to public sentiment through the imposition of impoverishments which are more distracting, easier to implement than responsible action, and are positively economic as opposed to the typically left wing political tactic of generous welfare spending, extra rights or other cost-negative appeasements, yet through the medium of hidden, indirect methods or rationalisations, has a more or less equally positive effect on the populace's opinion of the party responsible for the action.",null,0,null,1433206920,null,0,false,0,crshjy1,null,t3_384oe2,null,t1_crshjy1,null,t1_crsdmsd,null,null,null,1436652986,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

They have had guys who had been coming up big for them in the past (Pedroia, Big Papi, Napoli) who were really bad in the first part of the season. Pedey and Naps have picked it up but Ortiz was just benched for a few games. Hanley started off amazingly but got hurt and hadn't hit a home run in May until just a few days ago, when he went yard in back to back games. Apparently Pedroia and him sat down on the plane or bus and figured out the reason for his slump at the plate.

Before one of the games where he was sat, Ortiz was seen looking at pictures of where his front foot was landing when he swung. So basically it wasn't Chili Davis helping them figure it out, Pedroia did it for Hanley and Ortiz figured it out himself by looking at pictures to figure out that it wasn't his shoulders that were the problem, it wad his legs. He had three hits in the next game. 

Also they've had horrible injury luck and good players underperforming. This year their pitching was so bad they fired their pitching coach Juan Nieves, and it's picked up a bit but the rotation is inconsistent. Guys will look great one game and get pulled in the second the next. Buchholz, Joe Kelly, Wade Miley and others have all been substandard and often leave the offense with holes too deep to get out of. I could go on about how much the Sox sucks forever. 


After writing that it is pretty similar to the Liverpool situation. Good players underperforming, horrible injury problems for key players, defense poor (pitching), offense poor (hitting) and a coach under fire. Very interesting.

When you take drugs that release serotonin, or otherwise raise the amount of serotonin beyond natural levels, then you risk exceeding safe levels. The consequences of this can be fatal, as serotonin toxicity can cause coma, hyperthermia (&gt;41Â°C in some cases), seizures, kidney failure, blood clots, and rhabdomyolysis, amongst other effects.

A large number of drugs and a small number of other products have the potential to cause or contribute to serotonin toxicity.

If I were in your position I would be inclined to spilt it into 3.

Â£20k goes into a long term bond/savings that you use to kick start some sort of pension, retirement savings. It might seems ages away but starting now could be the difference between cruises in the Caribbean or living off state pension and eating cold beans. 

Â£20k goes into ISA or similar savings that is geared towards a deposit for a house. Once Uni is over you can add to it once you are earning and look to putting yourself on the property ladder. You don't say where in the UK you are and who knows where you will be once you have completed your studies or what jobs you might be looking at. But this windfall will really come in handy when you are ready. 

Last Â£20k is for the here and now. DRAW UP A BUDGET. look at your incoming and out going. Look at the terms of your student loan. Consider your future earning potential. If you can, put as much as you can (e.g Â£10k) aside as a rainy day fund. try and tie it up so it is accessible but with penalties, this way you will only dip into it if you ABSOLUTELY have to. If you finish your course and are earning good money at some point, you can go back to this money and maybe then consider using it to pay off student loans as you will have other sources of income to already have/be able to build another rainy day fund. Pay off any debt that is not your student loan.

Then write a list of things you want to do that the money would help with. With what's left after paying off your, if any, debts, have fun with  maybe half of it. This doesn't happen often so even if you are being smart you can enjoy a little of it. Go on holiday. Buy car. Pay for a course in scuba diving, flying, whatever. Just think about it carefully and plan it. Try and stretch this over your degree and maybe just after as a reward for completely it. Then the other half should be there to help you through your studies, graduate job hunt etc. Even if you dot have debts that's 5k for fun, 5k for now. It's not a lot of money at all but if you are still relying on your student loans/grants it should just bridge slight gaps not plug big holes.

They were also offered help in reforming the state and their internal markets in such a way as to make this sustainable.

3. Now the government is rolling back the few reforms that the state actually managed to implement and asking for debt write-downs. Pretty much all of the eurozone now pretty much wants Greece to go. Notably, these calls are led by other countries and not Germany now - especially Spain and very open economies like Slovenia.

But from what I've been reading I think you can kind of guess the sort of players Sherwood will be after.

**Goalkeeper**
I expect one new goal keeper to come in. Guzan will be sold and I'm sure that he will find a club. He is still a very good keeper and several mid-table, low table sides could use a good keeper. Given will stay on because I don't think he can be sold, and Steer is rated by Sherwood and will continue to play a role.

**Defence**
From the looks of things, a new right and left back will certainly come in. Senderos will be off (a bit of shame) so we will see one new centre-back come in. I don't know what age Sherwood will look for. Okore and Clark will still play a vital role. I'm unsure of Baker, I've been reading that Sherwood wants to sell him, which I don't really understand why. He's a good player still young and quite solid.

**Midfield** Gardner will definitely play a part, Sherwood rates him and he has been playing well in the u-21 since he has come back from his loan spell. I don't know if Sherwood rates Sanchez, he has played a bit but he definitely favours Westwood, Delph and Cleverly. I can only really see Sherwood signing Cleverly in this department, unless we miss out than he'll try to sign someone else.

**Attack** Here is where I see the most changes. I think Benteke will be sold if a club meets his buy-out clause. Weimann will also be off and I'm unsure of Kozak. I personally think that Kozak should be given a chance but this is Sherwood, Cissokho was never given a chance either but he looks to be off. I think Sherwood will try to bring in a physical player, similar to Benteke and another poacher (Austin-type player). 

I think Sherwood would like to replace N'Zogbia since he hasn't been great, so I expect maybe a new attacking midfielder?

All in all, we could see 5-8 new players at the club. Youth will be given a chance. ",null,0,null,1433209947,null,0,false,0,crsj8tn,null,t3_385ouh,null,t1_crsj8tn,null,t3_385ouh,null,null,null,1436654135,null,4,false,avfc,t5_2s569,4,null

I agree that they might not be the most awe inspiring names, as they've mostly been used for administrative purposes, and don't expect people to be proudly rallying behind the flag of North West or South East any time soon!

Icardi - same as Aubameyang, I'd love to see him here but I don't think Inter would let him leave easily

Dybala - off to Juve

Vietto - probably off to Atleti, loads of interest in him from CL clubs anyway

Berardi - haven't seen much on him, doesn't seem like he's good enough really

Bacca - 29 next September

Martinez - 29 next October, though I feel he's more worth it than Bacca still

Higuain - has no reason to come here, he can easily go to a CL club

Bueno - not sure who you mean by this

Dost - even more stationary and more of a target man than Benteke, if Benteke won't fit here neither will Dost, plus he wouldn't leave when Wolfsburg are in CL

Ben Yedder - not good enough

Mandzukic - I'm finding it weird why he's being linked with so many clubs. He's been good for Atletico and I don't see why they'd want him to go. Also, he has CL, and he's already 29. 

Alcacer - not good enough

Son - Leverkusen have CL, no reason for Son to come here, many better clubs who can pay him better wages would be interested if he was available

Ayew - not even a striker

&gt;
&gt;The First Doctor began writing the diary whilst still on Gallifrey, but left it there when escaping with Susan. It was returned to him by his mentor K'anpo Rimpoche, shortly before his first regeneration. (PROSE: *The Three Paths*)
&gt;Following this regeneration, the Second Doctor got his diary out of his storage chest and began to read it, even while walking through the mercury swamps of Vulcan. (TV: *The Power of the Daleks*)
&gt;The Doctor later checked his diary while on Telos to read up on a previous encounter with Cybermats. (TV: *The Tomb of the Cybermen*)

Of course the players have to learn how to play when we have the ball in the final third as well so it's not all Martinez's fault.

I absolutely love it so far, but that's pretty much only because they are 16-19 years old and it is in a more relaxed college environment.

I'm thoroughly uninterested in teaching children and dealing with the heaps of associated bullshit from all fronts, plus the maths is boring as hell (I'm still a mathematician at heart). I did help teach a year 11 class GCSE further maths/FSMQ additional maths working with their school, and that was great fun, but again only because they were more mature and extremely switched on.

If I'm honest, I looked for A-level/university teaching jobs because there were no post-docs available in my research area in the UK starting in late 2014 (live with my wife who works, so needed the money to keep flowing, and can't just up and leave to another country just like that), so decided that since I enjoyed the teaching aspect of my PhD so much, I might as well give it a go if I got offered a good deal.

An easy way into Big Finish is through the **Eighth Doctor** since he has so little screen time.  Although not necessary you may want to watch the **1996 TV Movie** to get a feel for him and his mannerisms, and then you could get into his Big Finish stuff in a few ways.

1) **Main Range** (Storm Warning) - 2 hour plays in the style of classic who stories.  If you're okay with the slower pacing and more expanded stories.

2) **Eighth Doctor Adventures** (Blood of the Daleks) - 1 hour plays in the style of new who stories.  The faster pace would make this easier for people that have only seen new who.  This is after the Main Range but doesn't really reference it.

3) **Dark Eyes** (The Great War) - Successor to the Eighth Doctor Adventures.  References the EDAs so I wouldn't recommend starting with it.

Another way is to get into the **Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors** by first watching a serial or two from the classic series to get their appearance and mannerisms down.  Then jumping into Big Finish when a new companion joins the TARDIS.

These are mostly in the **Main Range** and so they're slower paced 2 hour dramas.

1) **The Eye of the Scorpion** - Introduces **Erimem** to the 5/Peri TARDIS team.

2) **The Marian Conspiracy** - Introduces **Evelyn** to the Sixth Doctor.

3) **The Harvest** - Introduces **Hex** to the 7/Ace TARDIS team.",null,0,null,1433215715,null,0,false,0,crsmcy6,null,t3_384xhn,null,t1_crsmcy6,null,t1_crsjutv,null,null,null,1436656580,null,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2,null

1. Stop. Obviously.

2. You have an obligation by law to provide certain details to anyone with reasonable grounds to ask for them (other driver, police, etc). These include: Name, address, details of owner if the driver is not, and vehicle reg. If someone is injured this also includes providing an insurance certificate. 

3. If someone is injured you must inform the police. Either way, you can still use the 101 number to report minor bumps and scrapes if needed. They probably wont attend, but its good to do so.

4. If you suspect any injury, call the police on 999. They will then notify the ambulance service. You can do this the other way around but this is the more traditional way.

5. If its a minor bump, non injury, and you have exchanged details assuming the car is road worthy you can drive off on your merry way. If it's injury/police will attend, you must remain at scene until dismissed by police.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"I think everything you said is totally correct. But let me explain my thought process. 

The ""success in Europe"" bit only applies when I see it as beneficial to Celtic/the league. I'm from the States so perceptions over here are different. It's quite common for people here to root for teams they hate if it helps their league and in turn their team. (College American Football is the best example, but it's not always true. I'll root for rivals to the extent that it helps my team. I don't want them doing better than my team, but I'd like them to be successful if it ups my teams/conferences prestige.) I obviously didn't clarify this sentiment at all so I see your skepticism. Like I said, I don't want the bad guys to have anything better than my team to brag about, but if their success makes us appear more successful (and maybe bring in more quality as a result of perception) then I'm down for it. 

The taxes part with Rangers. If I were in you shoes I'd be just as pissed. So your point there makes sense. Not arguing against that.

Again, back to the perception over here in the States, a lot of people haven't even heard of any team in Scotland other than Celtic and Rangers. Some haven't even heard of either. So being a Celtic fan here can be difficult. Seriously, there are people that just pick huge teams, sometimes multiple, sometimes even those that are RIVALS (this is rare but I know people like this; they suck). So, for me there's always this personal vendetta to brag about the Bhoys. And part of that vendetta just naturally makes me want to see the league be as strong as possible; and I can't divorce myself from the idea that it would be better without Rangers.

All in all, I see what you're saying. But to be clear, I am a true fan. I do not like Rangers. Not at all. And I love Celtic. It's just that in my circle of existence Celtic becomes relevant when the league appears at its best. At the end of the day, I don't really give a shit about other clubs unless they serve to make Celtic ""better."" Maybe the means to achieving that are wrong.

Not alone but yes, by being capable back-ups to our first XI thus preventing fatigue. Except Milner who would immediately improve our first XI.

So would Milner, who is better.

If Pochettino didn't give Stambouli game time when we desperately needed a DM at the end of this season he's not going to do it next season.

Again, Trippier would be a great addition to the squad as our second choice RB.

Everyone I know has fucking kids! It's like they are a commodity. I totally agree with the nice houses and holidays. It's no wonder so many girls would rather pop out little pound signs rather than work hard when it's a free ride in life. I also know of 2 girls who lost their children to the social services for neglect and they still got to keep their nice houses!!! One girl I know just got transferred to a new build bungalow because she complained that the house was to big for her to clean and carrying things up the stairs hurt her poor back, when in reality she just didn't like how far of a walk it was away from the town centre she even sat and gloated to me about it like it was some sort of achievement. 

I'm sorry about your mum :( I've heard nightmare stories about cancer patients in the news, one that sticks out is the guy who was told to STOP his chemo if he wanted enough money to live on. I fear something like that will happen to me to. I look okay on the outside apart from a very unbecoming limp aha. I know I'll have a face to face interview soon and as far as I've heard if your fit enough to attend then your fit enough to work... But if your not fit enough to attend they will sanction you for not attending. It's a catch 22, even having a steadfast GP won't help. The Anxiety it causes is insane, I can only imagine the amount of helplessness you mother must have felt facing those cunts and cancer! 

I just don't understand how it works. I really don't. Also don't feel bad about your thoughts, I get them too.

I wasn't with any other soccer fans so the experience was sort of lost on me. Later that night we went back to MGM to the club hakkasan and sure enough the guys were there again. In my drunk, sleep deprived state of mind I thought it was the greatest thing. I told myself technically I had partied with them all day. I mean we had just experienced the same events, at the pool and now at the club. I decided at that moment completely blitzed out of my mind, looking up at the Spurs logo on the wall above me, that I would die a Tottenham fan. The next morning I went to the marquee day club and yep you guessed it, they were there again. I ordered a Tottenham t shirt and sweatshirt off world soccer shop before I even left Vegas. Bale transferred to real about two weeks later. I've watched almost every single game they've played over the last two seasons and am proud I decided to become a yiddo with the likes of you all.

The academies that the children are in, has nothing to do with the club that a parent may play or have played for.

You do not know the opinion or thoughts of any of these players, so how can you assume you do? You do not know if they were offered a spot in the academy, so how can you asume they were? 

Is that simple enough? I've said it enough times.

You really are a cosmic level of stupid. Send me your address and the next time I sit down to smoke a joint, I'll draw it up with some crayons for you, you may have to give me a week or two as moving house and managing a business are quite time consuming.

Most of your comments are clearly ridiculous strawmen of ""benefit scroungers"", which as we know represent a tiny proportion of the welfare bill anyway. 

&gt;People moan that they can't feed their children because of the government, when in reality they should have made sure they were financially sound and had stable jobs before they had children in the first place. Yeah I'm ready for the down vote parade, but I'm sick of people who can't take responsibility for themselves blaming everyone else.

You see this is a right-wing view, and that's *ok*. People *should* take the time to think about having children and whether they can afford it. 

But the reality is that simply some people don't. The conclusion of that shouldn't be ""well, fuck them then, it's their fault"". Not only that but sometimes it's not poor decision making but just really bad luck. The children they created shouldn't be held accountable for their parent's crappy decision making/luck. 

As a bleeding heart liberal, I think it's important society tries to create opportunity for all. Social mobility helps everyone and as a society it is the ethically, and i would argue economically correct thing to make sure everyone has a chance to make something of themselves.

That's the theory at least, however in practice it can be quite different.

That store was also the only place you could get a proper tie, house badges, blazer patch and indeed the blazer itself. 

So with a monopoly on the clothing the store did what you'd expect and jacked the prices up to silly amounts (Â£60 for some nylon trousers?  But of course).

&gt;I just don't find it acceptable in a first world very rich country like ours we have anyone struggling to afford basic human rights like food/water/shelter never mind people who try to work for these things.

This I have to disagree on. The living wage isn't about food water and shelter. It's defined as a minimum comfortable standard of living. Of course it would be nice if everyone had that comfortable standard.

To those too young to remember pre-2005 elections well he governed his party well, really coming to the fore in an otherwise moribund 2001 election campaign, and got them their highest number of seats to date in 2005 - however those within his party thought they could push on and do better.

In 2010 he opposed the coalition in its final format and opposed the rise in tuition fees. It was sad to see him fall to addiction but he is still very well liked.

When it comes to actually applying its really easy, moneysavingexpert has some great comparisons of cards, so you can read that thoroughly and pick one.  Then just go to the website and fill in your details and they'll figure out if they want to give you a card.  Whatever you do just make sure you pay it off in full every month without fail, thus paying no interest.

When it comes to saving, keep a 6month+ emergency fund in an easy access savings account.  You will want to keep this relatively large as an IC you don't have the security of a salaried position.  Once that's done pay off any debts.  After that look at opening an ISA and chucking money in that until you start maxing out your yearly contributions.  I personally don't bother with cash ISAs rates are horrid right now, stocks and shared ISAs are better but more risky.  If you plan on having a house deposit any time soon, better to keep your savings in a bog standard account for stability.

Prospects for significantly above minimum wage jobs down.

Especially for my partner working admin in the ailing NHS. She's almost on the lowest band and is now doing two and a half people's jobs.

Help to buy helped me and my partner buy a house.

But we still have had to take on insane amounts of debt due to *another* 5 years of failing to tackle the housing market (blame for this shitshow fairly apportioned to all in govt. for past 20 years).

Extremely glad that my partner and I are in stable employment now. If we were in the situations we were in five years ago, now, we'd probably fare a lot worse. Which, I think, is the most important point to take away.


[Edit] Oh, and my sister's partner was on a zero hours contract, working full time most weeks, alongside fully normally contracted workers. He had to apply twice to get on an actual contract to do the same hours for the same pay but with an actual decent contract. He was ready to walk away from the job if he hadn't been successful the second time. It's quite galling to do the same job as others, but with no security. He and my sister were looking for a house, but while he was stuck on zero hours, he was actually counting *against* their income. This forced them to look for houses affordable on a single income. In the South East of England. Obviously, that's a lost cause. Lucky for them, he got on to a full contract.


[Edit Edit] Ah, yes. And we only paid Â£3k p/a for university. My sister, three years older, only paid Â£1k p/a. Some of my younger friends have had to pay Â£9k p/a. So, again, if I ran the same course, five years later, I'd be much worse off.


[Edit Edit Edit] Where I work now has a lot of foreign students performing work for the research leaders. They come largely from within the EU, but also from further afield.

I have no stats to back this point up and im not to sure if any could exist but from personal experience, working class families have kids much younger and i wouldnt be surprised if the large majority of teen pregnancies were from low income houses.

I believe that if a child is brought up in house born to a mother who was a teen and had everything go swimmingly for them thanks to the tax payer that mother will most likely see nothing wrong with her child having a kid at 16 or whatever because it worked for her.

Def: I am not surprised if Sherwood is going to bring 1 or 2 replacement. Cissokho will stay. Vlaar might get a 2 year contract. I'm hoping Micah Richards will come to Villa. 

Mid: Our midfield is fine. No need for changes. I hope cleverly stays. I'm looking forward to what Gardner and Westwood to offer. Sanchez is fine. I would like to see how he can perform in his second season.

At the same time, I'm happy that he might stay due to not scoring in the FA cup final. So he might stay with us for another season. (Very subjective). Bent will leave. I would like to see how Kozak comes in play when he's alright.

1) You will have no experience (at least for a while). So that graduate programme you see advertised on the Internet will be beyond your reach.

2) You will have no idea what you are doing. 

However:

You already work in IT. Make something you and your colleagues will find useful for your current job. Then expand on it. Then re write it (you'll want to once you know a bit more). Then make something else. Then you'll find your job has morphed into a programming job. It'll take a couple of years maybe, maybe less, but you'll have fun along the way. 

Do this with your boss's blessing. Explain that you want to get into it. Explain that it won't get in the way of your current duties. You might find they are keen to offer some training in return for loyalty. Most places are. 

This is a good plan because you won't have to give up a job that pays well to go on some YTS scheme  (showing my age now) for Â£2 an hour. You will have to learn in your own time though. But it's fun to learn at your own pace. 

Get a copy of visual studio express (it's free). Get it all  installed and working. Google some ASP.Net MVC 5 walkthroughs. Follow them. 

After a while, depending on the time you put in, you will know:

HTML
JavaScript 
ASP.Net MVC
C# (there are a few .net languages. This is the one you want)

Then you can go on the learn SQL (database stuff). 

Then you can start on the new Windows 10 universal apps with MVVM and XAML. 

It might seem daunting but it'll be worth it. 

For some context, I am 37 and have only GCSEs. I work in London and make a very good salary. 6 figures good. I'm a contractor though. Which you could be in 4 years. 

You will feel like you have no idea what you are doing a lot of the time. But this is normal. 

So consider it. It's as good as a trade and will take about as long to learn. But you can stay in your job. If you do decide to go down the trade route though, I'm sure you'll enjoy that too. Which is the important thing here. Do something you enjoy. The money should come second. Easy to say, I know, but it's true.

I agree with his point about the playoffs but I just can't let him gloss over the behavior of the Motherwell fans both legs. I shouldn't have to preface this with **if Rangers fans done it I'd condemn it as well** but it saves me making that point later. I don't think I'm being particularly unfair here.

&gt; ...it is a little disappointing Rangers have felt the need to comment on our supporters...There was significant police presence, almost double what we would normally have for a game, way more than we would normally have for a Celtic game

Let's re-cap. The Rangers skipper was assaulted by some fat bam with a flag (no injury, but thrown pennies won't cause ABH most of the time until they do either) and nothing was done; a flare was ignited in an enclosed space and thrown onto the park disrupting the game (similar scenes at Ibrox) which endangers fans and grounds staff alike; and finally the pitch was invaded at the end of the game by a sizable contingent of the local Motherwell neds who immediately ran to intimidate and antagonise the away support to the point that Police Scotland's on-foot and mounted officers had to intervene. They had ***double*** the ordinary police contingent and that *still* wasn't enough to contain those morons. Finally, you had Erwin and Mohsni (thank fuck he's gone) behaving like a pair of rockets and another two Motherwell players getting involved in the fray. Backing up a mate? Doesn't matter, we'd **all** be nicked for that in public on the spot.

This is *completely* unacceptable behavior. We wouldn't tolerate this at any other game whether that involved Hearts, Hibs, Celtic, Aberdeen et all. We wouldn't tolerate this at any other demonstration, parade or gathering. Gordon Smith was wrong in saying he doesn't want the police involved - there is one rule of law and that trumps football authorities. Considerable disciplinary action and a neutral venue is needed to stop this from happening in the future. Or is this the kind of game we'd all be happy to go to?

And you know what the kicker is, if she takes a single day off, if she gets flu, or a stomach bug, or knocked over by a car, she's up for disciplinary review and sacking because ""she's had a lot of sick off"".

null,false,RushsMustache,lfc93,,null,"History suggests that foreign transfers are what works best for us. 
Right now Liverpool need players who can win games, if we look at our players from the last ten years or so who fit that category, Suarez, Torres, Alonso, Kuyt, Garcia etc. they have all come from overseas. 

If we think about players who were brought in from English clubs with that aim, Carroll, Downing, Cole etc. more often than not, they don't work out as successfully as those from overseas. They also come with bloated transfer fees and wages.  

Transfers from within England have provided us, at best, reliable squad players, of which we have no immediate need. 

That's not to say that good business can't be done in England, I've no issues with Clyne for 15 mill. Milner is a little more concerning, wages that high for a player who will be 33 when his contract expires is worrying, but I appreciate that we need that type of player after the departure of Gerrard. 

I'm in two minds over Ings; objectively, it's a great idea to bring in a young, English player on a free, but I'm just not sure if we need him. If Origi is coming back into the squad then what is the rotation? Do we send Origi out on loan again? We seem to do the same with a lot of the young players with potential that we bring in and never really utilise them before moving them on to new clubs, but that's another topic altogether. I also see parallels between Ings and Carroll, minus the transfer fee of course, both were players who had a good championship season preceding an adequate, but less than impressive, debut premiership season and, with Ings coming as probably third or fourth choice striker, I fear that he could just as easily end up having a similarly disappointing stint with Liverpool as Carroll.

If we do get Ings and a new striker (Benteke for instance) and Origi is brought in to the squad, we absolutely must move all of Borini, Lambert and Balotelli on. If we don't move them on we could end up paying wages for 5-7 strikers with a manager who favours a 1 striker system. Four of those players won't be getting any game time and those wages could be put to better use elsewhere in the squad, or on securing better targets initially.

Ultimately I feel that we are just retreading familiar territory as far as our transfer dealings are going, and we've all seen that what we've done up to this point hasn't really been working as well as we'd hoped. Maybe we should be trying something different.",null,0,null,1433232265,null,0,false,0,crssake,null,t3_384wul,null,t1_crssake,null,t3_384wul,null,null,null,1436660946,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Wikipedia starts to back up some stuff;
Teenage pregnancy is higher in more economically deprived areas. A report in 2002 found that around half of all conceptions to under 18s was concentrated among the 30% most deprived population, with only 14% occurring among the 30% least deprived. - So thats Claim 2 covered?

Because the two groups that are disunited at the minute don't agree on what that ""part"" even is. As communities, they already feel represented on their respective national flags - the tricolour represents 'peace between green and orange' and the Union flag has the cross of St Patrick as integral as the St Andrew satire or St George's cross. Already represented in the symbol of a greater whole.

This idea doesn't work because for unionists, there's already a symbol to rally behind (the NI flag), and for nationalists NI is an arbitrary designation that doesn't inspire specific pride.

Now, as a Northern Irish nationalist with no delusions about where I'm from (or what to call it), I don't feel represented at all by the NI flag. It's the English flag with a red hand slapped on it, and the ""six counties under the crown"" thing seems a bit brash when faced with such a sizeable nationalist minority.

Managers do a lot, and how can you call a team sport an individual sport? What makes it seem individualistic? There is an offensive and defensive side to the game. A lot rides on hitting and scoring runs, but it doesn't matter how many runs you score when your defense is garbage and let's in just as many. Likewise, pitching is very important, but if your ace kills it for 7 or 8 innings and your relief or closer comes in a fucks it all up, the game is blown. Baseball is very much a team effort. Errors are killer in baseball. An error can be as bad as the Gerrard slip. They can cost you a game. 

Not all managerial decisions are easy and not all tactics are 'obvious' in baseball. A manager has to know his players just like any sport. He chooses the batting order. He chooses the starting pitcher, who comes in to relieve him and when,who closes and when. This can vary depending on your opposition just like any sport. Right handers versus left handers, et cetera. Yes, shifts on defense are important and not always 'obvious'. Manager can call steals. Tell the base coaches what situations he wants guys to earn extra bases. He can tell his batters how and where to hit the ball. He chooses the structure of the defense and who starts where, which for many teams, like the Athletics for example seems to change almost every game. Baseball managers do a lot. Just as much as football managers. Don't kid yourself. It is very clear you know nothing about baseball, so in the future I would refrain from commenting on baseball matters until you learn.

It's less about the tax advantages are more about the fact that you shouldn't be going near the stock market with money you aren't sure (or as sure as you can reasonably be) that you can tie up for multiple years.  If there's a possibility that you might need that money in less than a year, then keep it in cash.

If you're sure you want to tie that money up for the long term then you might as well go straight into the ISA and save yourself the hassle and potential extra dealing charges.

You quite simply have not had time to read and evaluate *8* sources accurately, and those are highly selected ones. You have only sought out data that confirms your hypothesis.

Reference 7 is this: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2563952/

I *think* that the young mother -&gt; increased pregnancy is with the confidence intervals, because the number of people at that follow up stage is I think just 7. That might just be their adjusted figures, which probably fit with their discussion:

&gt; Regarding conceptions, we found that girls and boys born to teenage mothers, and boys but not girls from lone parent families, were more likely to report conceptions by age 15/16. Adjustment for SES reduced these associations; we lacked sufficient conceptions to enable precise estimates of adjusted associations.

Also, there's an interesting track of data here that would be more relevant to the other claims:

&gt; Our finding that girls from a lone parent family are more likely to report sex by age 15/16 only if their parents were in employment 

[snip]

&gt; It may be that young people with employed lone parents view early sex/parenting as compatible with a career, whereas those from jobless households do not. 

Also: 

&gt; We have no easy explanation for our finding that boys from lone parent families with nonâteenage, compared with teenage, mothers were more likely to report sex by follow up 2.

These might be interesting things to try and follow.

&gt; So i found 7 saying one thing and 1 saying something slightly different

Have you ever actually done a literature review?

For the record, I expect there is a relationship here. That's why I want to try and look for large scale data I can use to try and prove myself wrong.

In light of these changes, businesses will generally need to charge and account for VAT in the EU country where customers are resident.The purpose of the VAT changes is to level the playing field for suppliers regardless of where they are established. VAT rates across the EU presently range from 3%to 27% (average is 21.54%) with many e-service suppliers currently located in Luxembourg due to its low VAT rate.",null,0,null,1433237290,null,0,false,0,crstfok,null,t3_382og4,null,t1_crstfok,null,t1_crsspxl,null,null,null,1436661831,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

You have to understand that to a vegetarian, this will look a bit ironic.

&gt;Veganism is practically a cult for some of you lot, you're like bloody Hari Krishnas trying to recruit people. (Tongue in cheek)

Well, it's a view about *what everybody should do*. Which I guess some religions are too, but not only religions. You have beliefs like that too (maybe the belief that everybody shouldn't cheat on their spouse). And if you've got a view about what everybody should do, you try to convince others of it. If you had a friend who thought it was perfectly alright to cheat on his spouse, you'd probably try to convince her that it's not OK.

Saying ""damaging to the environment"" means very little, the environment has been changing since the earth began, and it will continue to change no matter what we eat. The plastic wrapper that your vegan food comes in is likely more ""damaging to the environment"" than any animal product. The computer you are typing this on and the electricity you are using is more ""damaging to the environment"" than any animal product. Probably 90% of the things you use in daily life is more ""damaging to the environment"" than the animal products I eat. Its somewhat hypocritical of you to accuse meat eaters of ""damaging the environment"" when you are doing just as bad if not worse through other means.

&gt;Did you know for example that 30% of the earth's landmass is dedicated to raising animals for food?

You say this like its a bad thing.

In modern times, striking doesn't really do much good, it just inconveniences lots of people. The modern equivalent of a strike is social media, bad press etc. That is of far more use to the working class than a picket line.

The BA strike was useless, all it did was push passengers to other airlines, the proverbial cutting off your nose to spite your face.

Good ol' Len, is just lining his own pockets from the pockets of the working class. All he's done is make Labour lose an election, and now he is fighting against giving his members the choice to opt-in instead of opting out. Yeah he really cares about his union members.

I know Reddit isn't the place for these views what with the student union people coming out in force, so I guess this will be minus 1 zillion internet points by tomorrow.

null,false,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,null,"&gt; Saying ""damaging to the environment"" means very little, the environment has been changing since the earth began, and it will continue to change no matter what we eat. The plastic wrapper that your vegan food comes in is likely more ""damaging to the environment"" than any animal product. The computer you are typing this on and the electricity you are using is more ""damaging to the environment"" than any animal product. Probably 90% of the things you use in daily life is more ""damaging to the environment"" than the animal products I eat. Its somewhat hypocritical of you to accuse meat eaters of ""damaging the environment"" when you are doing just as bad if not worse through other means.

I'm going to repost this from lower down in the thread:

[Eating less meat essential to curb climate change, says report](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/03/eating-less-meat-curb-climate-change)

&gt; The global livestock industry produces more greenhouse gas emissions than all cars, planes, trains and ships combined, but a worldwide survey by Ipsos MORI in the report finds twice as many people think transport is the bigger contributor to global warming. 

Meat production is hugely damaging to the environment, people are massively underestimating it's impact. Someone living a vegan lifestyle will have a much smaller carbon footprint than someone who doesn't, it will likely have a larger impact than abstaining from using a computer or buying things wrapped in plastic (and you aren't abstaining on those things either, so you don't have the right to look down on anyone).

&gt; Good for you but I like meat, it gives me plenty of much needed protein and fats.

Which can be got from other sources, soy protein has pretty much everything you need.

Personally I eat eggs and diary and occasionally eat fish, but abstain from eating other meat. For me that's a simple healthy diet that has a lower environmental impact and fewer ethical concerns. But it's seems perfectly possible to live healthily on a vegan diet, the main reason I don't do it is lack of willpower (I also imagine you have to plan your diet more to make sure you get enough protein).

&gt; I'm quite happy staying where I am at the top of the food chain.

I find it weird how people are proud to be meat eaters, it's not like your a hunter gathering who killed the animal yourself, you just choose to buy something different at the supermarket.",null,0,null,1433238074,null,0,false,0,crstlu8,null,t3_386loo,null,t1_crstlu8,null,t1_crstfv9,null,null,null,1436661950,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

I'm reading through some of the comments here and people seem to quite genuinely think that some people actually pay Â£330k for speaking engagements lasting 2 hours, that's really  *not how it works*.

The company that would have been paying for the event is Eat who I would guess were probably still owned by these guys when they booked this appointment:

Now, when a different private equity firm owns them, they happen to have cancelled this event as well! Shocking.

The French EPR is a weird hybrid of previous generation French and German designs. Fundamentally, not much is different. Everything works more or less the same, it's just that the safety systems have been dosed with steroids and someone then went a bit mad with the copy and paste button. So the EPR uses 4 complete safety buildings, each with a full set of safety systems to cover most eventualities. The problem is the huge number of parts and the huge amount of concrete for 4 gigantic bunker style safety buildings as well as the main containment building. There is a second issue which is that to simplify the systems they are all electrical and because they have been beefed up UPS batteries are only designed for 2 hours. This leaves the plant utterly dependent on diesel generators. 

The main competitor design is the westinghouse (now Toshiba) Ap1000. This uses a massively simplified design which relies on ""passive""  safety - where  cooling water circulates by buoyancy and emergency water injection systems are compressed air powered like giant aerosols, rather than using electric pumps. The plant is designed with 72 hour UPS batteries which will allow enough time to get the system safe and cooled without the need for diesel generators,  with enough time to call for emergency assistance.

My political views are pretty radically left wing, probably more than the majority of the people from this sub. I don't normally present these views on this subreddit, but when I do (say, arguing for an end to nation states), my comments will often get that little red cross next to them, meaning lots of people have downvoted them. I don't think I ever go about my comments in a dickish way (and if someone did find comments I made where I acted like a dick, I'll hold my hands up and take the blame), so the only conclusion I can make is that people are downvoting because they disagree with the ideas presented. 

However, and I hope I'm not painting with too broad a brush, many on the right would argue my comments would be right at home on this subreddit, because they are radically left. This simply isn't the case.

No but you are lecturing people for not being perfect, it seems you'd only be happy if someone was living like a cave man with no electricity, transport or participation in modern life.

It is slightly more physical than other leagues, but the main difference is the fast pace of the game. Good players will be able to play in the premier league regardless of where they come from. Very few genuinely good players fail in the PL but succeed elsewhere. A player like Benteke has proven that he can handle the league,  but not that he can be consistent. He also has no real experience in European competition. He's clearly not worth Â£32 million and, while I think he is clearly talented, spending Â£20 million on him will still be a gamble. 

 I haven't seen anyone say anything negative about Milner, and Ings is being pursued off the back of a single good season, being less of a sure thing than Benteke by every measure. 

  Every signing is a gamble, and PL players, especially English ones, are ludicrously overpriced.

Again, I'm not the one lecturing people about the environment.

&gt;the western meat heavy diet is not sustainable if everyone were to adopt it.

Says who? The vegan blogs you read? Most of the world already is on a meat heavy diet.

&gt;A laptop computer uses a tiny amount of electricity in the grand scheme of things, whereas as I've just pointed out the livestock industry is is twice as damaging to the environment as all transport combined. So why do you doubt it, just because it isn't what you want to hear?

What about the production of it, the transport of all the parts, the cost of transport for the factory workers who made it? etc.

I'm pretty sure a laptop has a larger carbon footprint than you think it does.

&gt;No but you are lecturing people for not being perfect

I'm telling people to practice what they preach, seems fair.

&gt;it seems you'd only be happy if someone was living like a cave man with no electricity, transport or participation in modern life.

Actually I don't care what you do, but don't lecture me about my diet because you think you are saving the planet with yours.

&gt;People taking steps to reduce their environmental impact like cutting out meat is a good thing,

In your opinion.

Cutting out electricity use would be a ""good thing"" for the environment, but you become very defensive when that is brought up.

&gt;why do you attack them for it?

I'm not attacking anyone, I'm asking them why they are attacking my diet choice for environmental reasons while they are guilty of doing the same damage through other means.

&gt;Why does it have to be all or nothing?

Why does it have to be meat? Why not choose something else to be high and mighty about? In fact, why not just let people eat what they want and stop being high and mighty altogether.


&gt;It's more a case of you being overly defensive than anyone else acting superior.

No, its people acting superior because they think they are saving the planet with their diet.

Its funny how you argue so righteously about how veganism could save the planet, but as soon as one of your other ""environment damaging"" comforts are brought up you jump right on the defensive.

&gt; Says who? The vegan blogs you read? Most of the world already is on a meat heavy diet.

Read the article I linked to. Read the reports the article links to if you want further reading. Come back to me if you want more evidence. There is plenty of evidence that we need to eat less meat if we are to avoid climate change, you are just choosing to ignore it.

&gt; What about the production of it, the transport of all the parts, the cost of transport for the factory workers who made it? etc.
I'm pretty sure a laptop has a larger carbon footprint than you think it does.

I buy a laptop about once every 5 years, how often do you eat meat? That has transport costs as well as the carbon footprint of producing it in the first place

&gt; Cutting out electricity use would be a ""good thing"" for the environment, but you become very defensive when that is brought up.

Electricity is required for modern society to function, and for people to live a decent quality of life, meat is not. Electricity can be generated from renewable sources that do not contribute to climate change, meat production cannot, each steak you eat contributes to climate change.

&gt; I'm asking them why they are attacking my diet choice for environmental reasons while they are guilty of doing the same damage through other means.

Your attacking people for using a computer and buying things wrapped in plastic when you also do these things and eat meat on top of this. Your lifestyle is worse for the environment than theirs, do you accept this? If so, where's your evidence that eating meat doesn't have a huge negative impact on the environment compared to not doing so? I've provided you with evidence that it does.

&gt; Why does it have to be meat? Why not choose something else to be high and mighty about? 

Do you have any other suggestions? One's that don't include cutting out something optional like eating meat, but would have as big an impact?

&gt; In fact, why not just let people eat what they want and stop being high and mighty altogether.

I am letting you eat what you want. You can do whatever else you want that's bad for the environment too, it's a free country. I'm not going to pretend it's not bad for the environment though so that you can feel better about it, which seems to be what you really want.

&gt; Its funny how you argue so righteously about how veganism could save the planet, but as soon as one of your other ""environment damaging"" comforts are brought up you jump right on the defensive.

A lifetime of using a computer a few hours a day is much less damaging than a lifetime of eating meat.

The Euro complicates this enormously (foreign owned debt is obviously more likely to be recalled) but only Greece is in serious concern of default, again i'm not arguing that massive spending is needed to leave the recession, we already had enough(automatic extra) spending in 2010 to get us out. We shouldn't have cut so harshly at the bottom of a recession, we should cut instead where we're in a boom as Keynes constantly recommends.

Zimbabwe and France is in the gutter as punitive taxes don't ever work, they just make rich people who run businesses leave. The only major sectors worth punitively taxing in the UK are tax avoidance and private rent as they do nothing but ensure backwards social mobility and don't provide any jobs/goods/services.

The idea is to mitigate the effect of speculative-hoarding and reduced capital turnover with government debt in recession and reclaim the debt when said people spend and lend faster (and ideally when inflation is creeping up as cuts reduce inflation).

How about you get on with your own life and let other people get on with theirs?

&gt;I am letting you eat what you want. You can do whatever else you want that's bad for the environment too, it's a free country. I'm not going to pretend it's not bad for the environment though so that you can feel better about it, which seems to be what you really want.

Why are you here telling us a vegan diet will save the planet then? 

&gt;A lifetime of using a computer a few hours a day is much less damaging than a lifetime of eating meat. I've already cut out many of my other comforts (I would never fly for leisure for example).

The transfer committee has shown that they will be willing to sign players the manager does not want, and it's absolutely ridiculous that that is the case. Signings like Balotelli, Alberto, Aspas have barely contributed at all. Aspas shipped off right away, Alberto being sent on loan and will likely never get into our squad. What's the point? How could it possibly be a good idea to sign players that the manager does not need / want and then request that the signings are somehow fit into the side? The last 5 years has just been failed transfer window after failed transfer window. The Coutinho / Sturridge window being the only exception. I don't think the committee has made a difference, and I think it is holding us back.

I think this is a bit revisionist. There were problems with Islamic Extremism before this. It's just rather than being an army that expanded in failed states it was a case of extremists being tucked away in oppressive states. After all 9/11 was the catalyst that sparked the two middle-eastern wars and that was an act committed by Islamic extremists. 

I think you're too quick to attribute all of those events to a single cause. Obviously if you change history other things will change too but we don't know if the alternative, non-Iraq, path would have seen less of a problem with extremism. We also don't know how long the oppressive regimes in the middle east could have been sustained and kept a lid on the likes of ISIS.

Okay, so, here is your guide to getting a reasonable grade in the...

**Reading test**

*Look for words that you know already*

You're not going to be able to understand an entire passage completely the majority of the time. Usually the questions get harder as you go through the exam, so by the final few questions, you will be at the point where you won't know every word. That's okay. It doesn't mean you're going to fail. Most of the time, you can figure out the general gist of the text anyway, going by the few words that you know.  **Pick out key phrases to try and find the general meaning of the entire text, and then work from there**. That's the best thing you can do really.

*Pay attention to context*

There's one particular type of question, where people tend to do quite poorly. It's a fill in the blanks exercise, basically - they'd give you a German paragraph with some words missing, and you select from a few options which words go where. The important thing to do here is make sure you can see how the words fit. Look at the verb endings. Translate the sentence in your head, see if it makes sense. Think of certain rules - should this be gehen or fahren? That sort of thing. This particular question is the type of thing you should be double checking.

*Double check your answers*

See how well I made that segue in from the last one? This is a pretty obvious point, but it's quite important in the reading test, particularly because you don't quite get the option to do this in the listening test. You know the drill with this one really; it's just a good way to pick up extra marks, and it's the sort of thing you'd be advised to do in all exams anyway.

**Listening Test**

*Make notes*

There's five minutes at the start of the exam, right, where you're given time to read. Use this time wisely. Go through the paper and label things. If it has little diagrams, label them. Write down the german word for beach or whatever. That way you know what to listen out for later on. 
Do it the whole time, in fact, not just during those five minutes. Jot things down throughout; any keywords that stand out to you while you're listening, that sort of thing.

*Listen both times*

This is probably also an obvious one, but worth mentioning nonetheless. The tape repeats itself for a reason. If you don't get the answer the first time, pay close attention the second. If you think you got it the first time, listen the second time anyway. They try to put in dual meanings and misdirection to trip you up, and this is going to be your only chance to check for mistakes.

*Guess*

Not, like, in general. But if you ever don't have an answer, always make a reasonable guess. The majority of these questions are multiple choice, so you have a reasonable chance of picking up extra marks where you do that. Do this in the **reading test** as well, because it's just a good catch all thing. Even for the answers where they want you to write a sentence or two, try and put down something sensible.

*Beware of false friends*

I actually think the name ""false friend"" is really stupid, but it's the term that teachers tend to use, and I haven't come across the proper term. Like, ""cognate"" is a word that looks the same in both languages. ""False friend"" is a word that looks like a different word. They tend to use these a lot to try and misdirect you. It's things like describing someone as ""streng"" - it looks like ""strong"", but it actually means ""strict"".

*Vocab*

Follows on from the last one, and applies to the **reading test** as well. Spend a couple of hours today revising vocab. It's difficult to tell you what to revise, specifically, because these reading/listening tests don't follow the same modules we've done in class exactly. I'd say just go for vocab that's going to be applicable in different scenarios - verbs and common nouns I suppose. Maybe also broad topics, like the home, around town, the environment. Things like that.

*Don't Panic*

And, finally, in the immortal words of Ford Prefect, don't panic. If you get flustered, it's going to be a problem. Just focus on the words, and try to remain as calm as possible.

At the end of the day, you still have your coursework grades, which I think would average out at an A between the two of them. So long as you make a reasonable effort at this exam, I'd say you should be able to get at least a B overall.

Sorry but you really can't make such statements with any confidence when it comes to historical events. Here's why :

&gt;Would there really have been the London and Madrid attacks without an Iraq war?

Spain didn't invade Iraq. They only had 1000 troops in Iraq on police duties and they only joined the Multi National Force after the invasion was over. There were 36 other countries who also contributed forces but didn't actually invade. Why aren't these countries being targetted by bombers ?

In addition, the motive behind the Madrid bombing's has never been made clear - it could have been about Iraq or it could have been because parts of Spain were once under Muslim rule. Even the group who claim repsonsibility can't be confidently established.

The London 7/7 bombers left behind video messages. They state Iraq and Afghanistan amongst their motives but they also say the the UK's support of the USA and Israel are reasons for the bombings.

null,false,DeadOptimist,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"&gt; I haven't quite made my mind up about the human rights act yet. Without having studied the current law and thought about its ramifications in detail

Here is the thing about the HRA. It is not really about what rights it contains, it is about how easily the government can change them. Currently our HRA simply incorporates the ECHR (which we wrote anyway). Thus, if you wanted to change the legislation on these HR, you would need to:

1) change the ECHR (not going to happen)

2) remove the incorporation of the ECHR (aka, remove HRA with a BBR)

The thing about these two points is they are both big politic expenditures. You've already seen how much of a shit storm has been blown up just talking about it. The closer a government gets, the bigger the backlash.

HOWEVER! If we had a BBR, that could be changed really easily as it doesn't depend on any outside sources. a BBR could be changed through a simply majority or any other manner in which the government passes legislation. In effect, a BBR (without constitutional protection which we do not have) would allow a government to tinker behind the scenes if it wanted to change something.

It's not really a debate on what rights you want and what you do not, it is a debate on **how easily you want the government to be able to change your rights**. 

An example would be those deportation cases. The government was unable to change the law in those situations (even though it eventually found in favour of the government). Under a BBR, the government could pass an amendment etc. to get to whatever conclusion it wanted. 

In the US peoples rights are protected by a constitution which their courts can use to override government action. We do not have that protection here in the UK. The closest thing we have is the ECHR via the HRA. Even if you have faith in the current government and would be fine with them having the power to change your rights on a whim, can you be assured it will remain OK forever?

I remember wondering what that counted as, and if suddenly student loan holders will become a source of state labour: building roads and such, serving in the military, pushing paperwork around, whatever. I also remember thinking it was somewhat unlikely to affect anyone that did a degree that meant they were more employable afterwards. If you're earning 30-40k/year, then it seems unlikely that they'd complain about your work being ""unreasonable"".

So long as you're making repayments according to the repayment plan, I suspect it would be difficult to suddenly change the terms of that debt. Fairly sure that they would meet with pretty solid resistance if they announced every penny had to be repaid in full within ten years of now, for instance.

Would be interesting to see what happens if they decided to not write it off after thirty years to be honest. But once again, given the majority of people pay off the majority of their student loan during their working lifetime, so I doubt it'll be an issue.

At Â£25/week, that someone mentioned, you'll pay off around 40k over 30 years. My student loan, as a London graduate with the highest level of debt, approaches total repayment of around 50k (13-14k/year of study + interest), off the top of my head. So presuming that most students aren't London students from zero income families, the system seems pretty reasonable.

You realise that everyone pays taxes... if people aren't supported what is the point of the entire system? Defense and health. Fuck that there are homeless people for pay tax through VAT.

I know the Tory view as incentive based and I can see their reasoning and I won't give you shit for believing that way, but during a recession giving a tax break to rich whilst limiting benefits... I'm sorry but there won't be tory voter that isn't rich that will defend that.

Labour aren't perfect either, I'll gladly slap them down for raising tution fees and embracing right wing economics. Fair play if your for right wing but your idiot if you think economic growth, especially in this country with a massive trade deficit, doesn't come from consumer spending... which happens to be at the bottom of the wealth pyramid. Fucking them over and expecting growth seems a little stupid no?

Lets not even go into the fucking morals of it all. Is it morally right to cut welfare for people whilst not even going after non tax doms? I'm sorry but conservatives will agree that is fucked up. Nothing wrong with being a tory voter, but don't act like they haven't fucked the welfare system and the tax cuts you speak of go the middle class, not the worst off. Best they've got is no tax under thirteen thoasand, given by the Lib dems because of my earlier point of where economic growth comes from.

The reason you get downvoted is not so much that you have right wing ideals, it's just because alot of right wing ideals deserve to be laughed at because they don't have a economic, moral or just plain common fucking sense to stand on.

You wanna argue the right wing incentives point of view be my guest but it kinda fucks up on the start that people aren't rational.

Is there a case to be made that Blair, in collusion with other parts of the British security infrastructure, as well as overseas powers, arranged a war of aggression for reasons other than those stated (45 mins, weapons of mass destruction). Yes, I think a case could be made that someone ought to answer for it. If not Blair, that would be shown in court.

Also, for example:

a) [There is some debate about the legality of the iraq war](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/16/iraq.iraq)

b) [And in the UK, too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_the_Iraq_War#United_Kingdom)

As the legality of the war is at least debatable, so is the criminality of those prosecuting it. I believe your assertion that Blair is not by this definition a war criminal is likewise debatable. As to the final outcome, well, that's what we have courts for.

The proposal here seems to be just to scrap the entire R&amp;D side of the defence industry in the UK, but if you do that the country ends up stuck with disposable or last generation equipment like the F/A-18. Which, by the time we've trained pilots for and are capable of operating with from a catapult at sea, will be obsolete. It's a dead end to take that route, and we might as well just wait for the F-35.

Besides, whilst it's easy to bemoan the issues with the UK's defence spending, it's hard not to see the results when it goes *right* in the Type 45s (now that they're halfway to being properly outfitted) and Challenger II. It's equipment built to last a very long time and be updated as time goes on, that is spending a lot now to save more later on.

The real problem isn't over spending. It's that we've had a couple of stupid decisions from a government that has slashed budgets in a panic, and left a gap in the defence capabilities. The same short term thinking would only lead to more issues later on.

Escaping the May-trix: Snoopersâ Charter will force a mass exodus of tech firms from the UK
 JUNE 2ND, 2015 - 12:54 AM  ANDREW LEARMONTH Â 9 COMMENTS
THERESA Mayâs Snoopersâ Charter will have a massive impact on Scotlandâs tech industry and financial services, as companies warn of a âmass exodusâ from the UK should the Bill be approved.

Part of the Tory Governmentâs Investigatory Powers Bill, introduced in the Queenâs Speech, will force companies using encryption software to include âback doorsâ into the software.

If passed into law, it means that any software or hardware made in the UK must contain a way that allows data to be accessed by the Security Services.

Organisations such as MI5 and GCHQ will be able go through this âback doorâ to see information held by business and financial services using British made software. The impact, analysts warn, will be falling sales for those companies making the programmes, and for financial services who need to keep customersâ data safe, many of whom will undoubtedly relocate overseas.

Duncan Chapple, a researcher at Edinburgh University who specialises in tech security, said: âThere will certainly be organisations concerned that their business transactions will be more open to Government oversight. It seems very sensible to start thinking about moving servers to another country.â

The academic also warned that it could have a direct impact on inward investment: âNot only if youâre a British company, but also, perhaps more so, if you are the British subsidiary of a foreign business, with which an important British business competes then you will be concerned about becoming a target of commercial spying which the British state does to serve British industries.â

Over the weekend, two companies announced that they would be leaving the UK because of the law â Ind.ie and Eris Industries both claimed that the new law would drastically affect their business.

On a blog post, Preston Byrne from Eris highlighted why he thought the UK Governmentâs plan was wrong.

Bryne wrote: âThe fact is, however, that cryptography overwhelmingly protects legal businesses and ordinary people, not criminals and terrorists, from harm.

âStrong cryptography should therefore remain entirely free and legal. If this Bill is passed into law, we are likely to see a mass exodus of tech companies and financial services firms alike from the United Kingdom. We are happy to lead by example.â

Nick Lambert, from Troon-based MaidSafe, sympathised with Byrneâs decision.

Lambert said that the work being done by MaidSafe simply could not be done if the Snoopersâ Charter becomes law.

He added: âOur product is very much a security product. It has encryption automatic, within the way it works.

âYou literally couldnât install back doors, it would break our system. In terms of that being an option, thatâs not an option.

âIf they made it illegal for us to have products going out there with encryption it would cause us problems because our product can only exist with encryption and itâs not technically possible to put back doors, the way the systemâs designed. You just canât do that.

âIt would break the actual fundamental design. That would cause us issues. As to what we would do then, well who knows?â

Ed Paton-Williams, campaigner with Open Rights Group, said that they could foresee many companies moving operations overseas: âI would not be surprised if more companies come out and say [leaving the UK] is something they would consider doing. It reduces their ability to do business securely and thatâs crucial to showing that theyâre profitable because they rely on trust with their consumers and their customers.â

A spokesperson for the Scottish Financial Enterprise, which represents the financial services industry, said: âNone of our members have voiced concerns to us about this. However, privacy and data security are taken very seriously in the industry so we will monitor developments and discuss with members where appropriate.â

The Investigatory Powers Bill was first proposed as the Data Communications Bill in 2012, but was blocked by Government coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats.

Now, with nothing to hold them back, Home Secretary May and Prime Minister David Cameron have a renewed zeal to see the Bill reintroduced.

As well as the introduction of the back doors, the legislation would require internet service providers and mobile phone companies to keep records of every single userâs internet browsing activity, including social media and services such as WhatsApp. Details of email correspondence and voice calls would all be stored for 12 months.

During a speech in January, Cameron asked: âIn our country, do we want to allow a means of communication between people which we cannot read?â

The Prime Minister continued: âThe first duty of any government is to keep our country safe. The attacks [on Charlie Hebdo] in Paris demonstrated the scale of the threat that we face and the need to have robust powers through our intelligence and security agencies in order to keep our people safe.

âThe powers that I believe we need, whether on communications data, or on the content of communications, I feel very comfortable these are absolutely right for a modern, liberal democracy.â

At a conference over the weekend, internet inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee warned this would be a defining moment for the web.

He said: âThis discussion is a global one. Itâs a big one, itâs something that people are very engaged with, they think itâs very important, and theyâre right, because it is very important for democracy, and itâs very important for business.â

A Scottish Government spokesperson said: âWhile we are supportive of law enforcement agencies and security services having access to the information they require, the appropriate checks and safeguards must be in place to ensure that the requirement to keep our communities safe is balanced against the civil liberties we are all entitled to.

âWe will consider the implications of the Investigatory Powers Bill once a draft has been published by the UK Government and the review of investigatory powers by the IndependentÂ Reviewer of Counter-Terrorism legislation has been published.â",null,0,null,1433247573,null,0,false,0,crsw50y,null,t3_386vos,null,t1_crsw50y,null,t3_386vos,null,null,null,1436663766,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

a 17p (3%) increase in the rate for 18 to 20 year olds (from Â£5.13 to Â£5.30 per hour)

The National Minimum Wage rate for apprentices will increase by 57p (20%) from Â£2.73 to Â£3.30 per hour. The LPC recommended an increase of 2.6% to Â£2.80 in the apprentice rate.

&gt;The Government is also putting employers in control of the funding for apprenticeships by introducing a new digital apprenticeship voucher. Vouchers can be used to reduce or eliminate training costs with appropriate providers.

&gt;Apprenticeship vouchers will further simplify things for employers and give them the purchasing power to fund apprenticeship training.

The discounted rate, which could be up to 100% for 16 to 18 year olds, at which employers can purchase training, would be calculated and the employer would be able to pass on the voucher code to the provider that is delivering the training.

&gt;Well it is if we stop eating meat, it takes 8kg of crops to produce each kilo of beef for example, if we all turned vegetarian we could feed billions more (and we already have enough to feed everyone even with eating meat, it's just not shared equally).

Its not, the world is already overpopulated and its not just because of lack of meat. Anyway, just think of how much good that 8kg of crops are doing for the environment. 

&gt;Just to be clear though, are you actually advocating killing billions of people (indirectly, though climate change) rather than change you diet/lifestyle?

Just to be clear, are you actually trying to deny that death happens to everyone at some point?

And if you want to play this childish game, ""Are you actually advocating the death of billions of people rather than not using electricity or oil?""

Let me guess, ""that's *different*""

&gt;Why did we try and stop the Nazis?

Godwins law. Also, because they invaded Belgium whom we had a pact with that we would defend them from invasion.

&gt;Why did we abolish slavery?

Because it is wrong to own another human being as property.

&gt;Why don't we allow murder and torture?

I appreciate the address of the issues surrounding the connectivity at epic fourteen. 
The lead network admin said at the event that during the point with most players using the connections, one of the fibre to the cabinet connections had been dropped and they were running 400(?) players off 2 x 80/20 connections under contention. The worst bit about contention for this type of use is that they will contend with each other too, so home broadband or small office broadband packages will simply not suffice.

The solution put in place to load balance fttcs and use the older firewall, along with moving to at least two diverse ISPs is fair enough, though I haven't had experience in the business sector with Ethernet over fttc. If this proves ineffective again, an EFM is really your stepping stone between LES and FTTC in terms of price performance. I wish the network team a lot of luck and coffee as this is going to start hurting if the connectivity issues are anything like last time. The commercials aren't in place to support perfection but getting this sorted and spending some extra to ensure this doesn't go tits up is required - epic had a one off shit time and avoiding a repeat is important.

Personally, I'm not attending this time around after being stuck with no internet for 3 hours when we were meant to play tournament games, then being stuck with lag (local, even stupid watercooled OC rigs of the team were suffering) on the hosting pc for lan (no dedicated pcs to run Dota? No clients had the issue, only host, a real lack of contingency planning) along with a lovely consistent 14kbps for anything internet after moving hall when they couldn't fix the switch.
Apologies already accepted and I appreciate the feedback from that event's issues both lan and wan, but as it was my first epic I couldn't justify going this time in comparison to how the I series events are done.
I really hope the event goes well and the news of it all brings myself and any others with doubts back to epic. It was a great venue for a social event, just disappointing if I wanted to actually play the damn game. I've never heard of a lan with no internet and no local servers, but it's what I got for all but the last day.

I know you don't read links but [Climate change threatens one in six species with extinction, study finds](http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/04/climate-change-threatens-one-in-six-species-with-extinction-study-finds/)

&gt; Its not, the world is already overpopulated

No it isn't, where's your evidence for that statement?

&gt; Just to be clear, are you actually trying to deny that death happens to everyone at some point?

Everybody dies, not everybody gets killed. If people die as a predictable result of our actions, we are killing them.

&gt;&gt; Why did we abolish slavery?

&gt; Because it is wrong to own another human being as property.

So it's wrong to own people, but not to kill them? Are you a libertarian by any chance that seems to be their type of reasoning.

&gt; Why are you advocating for overpopulation then? Looks like you're the one wanting people to suffer here.

I'm not advocating overpopulation. The population will stabilise as people start having less children, we are already seeing this is global population trends. What we don't need to do is deliberately contribute to climate change in order to try and kill off some of the population. Climate change will cause everyone to suffer by the way, even those who survive.

&gt; I have a tough time who has a childlike view of the world. ""Lets save everyone by not eating meat"", right pal, whatever you say...

But by eating less meat and making other changes we could prevent climate change. You are the one coming across as an edgy teenager - ""let's do nothing about climate change because people die anyway, I'm too edgy to care about anyone else's suffering"".

The thing with legal highs is they are not actually sold as legal highs. Rather, they are sold for other activities with a wink and a nudge. For example, people sniffing glue - that is a legal high to an extent. 

The problem comes with these legal highs, is that they are not tested for human consumption (since they are not sold for it) and no instructions (i.e. dose) is given. Further, dangerous ingredients may be included because again, the law isn't looking at them from the point of consumption.

So what can be done? Well, you can make them illegal, but it isn't going to stop things like this being sold. A simple chemical change (they are changed relatively often to count as ""new"" products to get back onto the market), or a return to using more dangerous and conventional (glue) products.

If you fancy a spot of old England then Oxford or Cambridge (but not both - they are a bit too similar). Also old cities like Colchester or York on your way up north can be worth a visit.

Never in history has a second credit crisis occurred in moments of a previous one, recoveries are slow and people are cautious. Besides what's the difference between spending to get out of the first recession and not the second? a little bit more debt interest to service which again is absolutely trivial at this point. Spending to get out of recession has worked at every point in British history and improves wealth distribution like after WW2.

The only time austerity 'worked' was with Margaret Thatcher whose 'Boom' came at the cost of millions of poor peoples livelihoods and was primarily funded by massive discount public asset sales(*ahem* Royal Mail and Right to Buy sound familiar?) and infrastructural spending to boost the financial and housing speculation sectors(like they never caused a crash).

Since Liverpool's last league title, 26 years ago, we have had transfer failing after transfer failing and it has caused us to remain out of the winner's podium for a while. in recent memory, we have had mixed results in the foreign market, and with the proliferation of the ""homegrown"" rule, we are looking to buy the best ""homegrown"" talent. 

in very recent memory, look up how morientes, voronin, aquilani, el hadji diouf  and others have worked out, but on the flip side look at how fernando torres, daniel agger, martin skrtel, hyppia and others have worked. while we cnnot quantify what percentage of success foreign players will have, the general idea behind our current strategy is that current epl layers are used to the league, the pace of the game and won't need a bedding in period. we bought a lot of foreign players last season (i believe) with the hope that they probably wouldn't come good this year, but in a couple years time (moreno, marko, manquillo, baloteli, origi, and can) while the older players purchased (and balotelli is kind of a hybrid b/c he has had succcess in the prem before) were epl ""ready"" players. so while i think it's ok for people to be upset, it's also ok that this is their strategy. they are taking a long term approach with last season's window and the name of the game this season is to get guys who will hit the ground running, quite literally (because we're looking at a lot of guys with high work rates in milner, ings and clyne particularly). 

now mind you, rodgers isn't ""this bad"" necessarily because of the targets. you have to keep in mind we have scouts, a team of them all over the world, we have a committee...so if BR could have it his way, he'd probably want reus, lacazette, felipe luis, miranda, ricardo rodriguez, blah blah blah..but in this current climate, these are guys who will get *hopefully* get us results in the epl and get us back into the top 4. 

to your point on benteke, please also watch benteke and how he played against us in the fa cup semi final. his goal came off a half volley where he arrived in the box...he is not as one dimensional as you think, and quite frankly, way more athletic than lambo. your assesment of not being too pacey is off, and his strength is immense. no he wont get in behind like a suarez, but imagine a 4-4-1-1 where we have benteke up top and sturridge running off of him as a second striker. it gives us a completely different formation to play around with and he is very technical as well.

You said life on earth would be ""fine"". I don't consider mass extinctions to be ""fine"". Perhaps we have different definitions of ""fine"" as you also seem to think it would be ""fine"" if billions of people were to die due to climate change, because the alternative of preventing it would be too inconvenient.

&gt; How about you give me some evidence from a valid source for all the shite you have made up, then we'll talk. And no, a Guardian article is not a source.

Why don't you back up something you say with evidence for a change, where is the evidence that the world is overpopulated?

&gt; You're the only one here saying we are killing people, and if we are, then you are just as guilty as me.

You're the only one here advocating killing people, you're the only person I've seen argue that climate change is a good thing as it kills off what you see as the ""surplus"" population. No I'm not as guilty as you as I'm taking some measures to try and reduce my impact on the environment, you are actively embracing the destruction you are causing.

&gt;&gt; I'm not advocating overpopulation.

&gt; You just said you are.

I never advocated it, I just answered your question.

&gt;&gt; The population will stabilise as people start having less children

&gt; I wish I had a crystal ball to see into the future.

As countries get richer they tend to have fewer children, the global population is expected to stabilise, you don't need a crystal ball to see this you just need to look at the statistics and extrapolate a little. I can you post you a link to explain this further if you promise to actually read it?

&gt; So, will you now stop using electricity and oil? Or is that still different.

I actually need to use electricity and oil.

I opted for the crap group, because I am. Learnt quite a bit about controlling the bike on loose surfaces, which I applied a bit too often on the Elephant &amp; Castle roundabout afterwards. A couple of went back at least once to do the enduro school and rated it. Only one of them came home with a broken arm. I came home in a knee brace. Ho ho ho.

I won't vote Greens because they remind me of what the Libs used to be like, plus it's by far the most talk-shit party out there.

UKIP are the only party who I think genuinely believe in what they say, but I won't vote for them because I don't like their policies at all.

Honestly, I think Labour, Tory and UKIP parties are the 3 least likely to lie to everyone.

SNP lied through their back teeth during the referendum (I live in Scotland), it was actually comical the extent how people would use doublethink to rid their conscience of their contradictions, but their voters didn't care, they would do anything.

You are advocating overpopulation, which can lead to suffering. And you are as guilty as me, eating meat isn't the only cause of climate change. ""I only killed 50 people, you killed at least 200, that means you're worse than me"", get a grip son.

&gt;No I didn't

Yes you did, here it is, in response to my question as to whether you thought overpopulation was a good idea:

&gt;A better option than billions of people dying because we didn't do enough to tackle climate change? Yes, obviously.

Naive *and* a liar. 

&gt;As countries get richer they tend to have fewer children, the global population is expected to stabilise, you don't need a crystal ball to see this you just need to look at the statistics and extrapolate a little. I can you post you a link to explain this further if you promise to read it?

You do know most of the world consists of countries that aren't ""rich"". Also, you do know that not every country can be rich, there will always be winners and losers in the global economy. As hard as this might be for you to understand, the world isn't all nice and friendly.

&gt;I actually need to use electricity and oil.

No you don't, you just want to use it because it makes your life better. If you think I'm willingly ""killing people"" (as ridiculous as that sounds) through climate change, so are you.

&gt;It's perfectly possible for us to still live modern lifestyles and avoid climate change,

No it isn't, its going to happen regardless of what anyone does.

&gt;we need to make only very minor changes to how we live such as switching to renewable/nuclear forms of electricity production and then electric cars, and yes probably eating less meat.

And climate change will still happen anyway.

Yes it is. What other way is there of interpreting this? You are saying that the reason you believe it is not suicide is because it is not being treated as suspicious. For this to be a logical line of thought, one must believe that a suicide would normally be treated as suspicious by the police, or else it makes no sense - if suicide were not normally treated as suspicious, then the fact that the police are not treating it as such tells us nothing about whether it is suicide or not.

What are you talking about?

Edit to clarify, my positions you have disagred with:

* That Tony Blair has learned facts, skills and experience that others do not have, and that we do not have access to.

* Tony Blair is paid to talk at events like this because of his experience and knowledge. By accepting the job he is aligning himself as being interested in ending or at least reducing world hunger.

* That you should care about humanitarian projects you work on.

* That a Prime Minister should care about their causes and positions, because it really doesn't pay that well for the work involved. 

* That being Prime Minister isn't a normal job

* That being middle east Peace Envoy isn't a normal job

In my opinion, Tony Blair clearly does care about the middle east, international aid and world hunger. The problem is that he is incompetent, and blinded by his ego to the extent of his incompetence. He has justified to himself, that becoming rich from charitable work is a noble cause, and that he is doing a net good.

&gt; You are advocating overpopulation

No I am not.

&gt; Yes you did, here it is, in response to my question as to whether you thought overpopulation was a good idea

&gt; A better option than billions of people dying because we didn't do enough to tackle climate change?

I wasn't saying it was a good idea. I was answering your question. You gave me too options, overpopulation with everyone turning vegan, or billions of people dying. I don't think either are a good idea. We can have a stable population with people just eating less meat, that is what I want, that's what I am advocating. But I would rather live in a crowded world than one where we tried to kill people off, would you not?

&gt; You do know most of the world consists of countries that aren't ""rich"". Also, you do know that not every country can be rich, there will always be winners and losers in the global economy. As hard as this might be for you to understand, the world isn't all nice and friendly.

People are getting richer as a whole, and absolute poverty is down. The global economy is not a zero-sum game, I guess we can add economics to the list of subjects you don't understand alongside climate science. People can afford to eat a better diet now including eating more meat. Because of this global demand is rising. This was explained in an article I posted elsewhere in this thread, but you refused to read:

[Eating less meat essential to curb climate change, says report](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/03/eating-less-meat-curb-climate-change)

Appetite for meat is rocketing as the global population swells and becomes more able to afford meat. Meat consumption is on track to rise 75% by 2050, and dairy 65%, compared with 40% for cereals. By 2020, China alone is expected to be eating 20m tonnes more of meat and dairy a year.

&gt;  If you think I'm willingly ""killing people"" (as ridiculous as that sounds) through climate change, so are you.

I said climate change would kill billions of people, you basically said that was good as there were too many people anyway, and we shouldn't try to prevent climate change. ""Just as nature intended it."" were your exact words. It does sound ridiculous, but that's what you said.

Also I'm just going to have to repeat myself here but no I'm not as guilty as you as I'm taking some measures to try and reduce my impact on the environment, you are actively embracing the destruction you are causing.

&gt; And climate change will still happen anyway.

So its a bad idea? Ok good, glad we can agree.

&gt;We can have a stable population with people just eating less meat, that is what I want, that's what I am advocating.

Not going to happen.

&gt;People are getting richer as a whole, absolute poverty is down, people can afford to eat a proper diet now including eating more meat. Because of this global demand is rising. This was explained in an article I posted elsewhere in this thread, but you refused to read:

And long may it continue.

Again, a Guardian article is not a source, its a tabloid.

&gt;Appetite for meat is rocketing as the global population swells and becomes more able to afford meat.

Good.

It is how nature intended. Sorry to say, but humans aren't actually the centre of the universe. Climate change will happen whether you like it or not.

&gt;Also I'm just going to have to repeat myself here but no I'm not as guilty as you as I'm taking some measures to try and reduce my impact on the environment, you are actively embracing the destruction you are causing.

""I only killed 50, you killed 300, you're worse than me"" Awful logic. You're still guilty of the nonsensical ""crimes"" you just made up.

I understand they are important which is why I will say that I don't particularly think they look good in some environments but when it's proven that they will be beneficial to the community and area, they should go ahead and build them REGARDLESS.

I do photography as a side hobby. I had gone to a coast town for a few days in Wales last month. I did not know they had dozens of wind turbines out in the sea. It didn't deter me from enjoying the beautiful view (I haven't gone to a beach in 15 years), but I think my photos would have turned out a little better if it wasn't for the wind turbines. Some will say they add to the photos, some agree the photos would have looked better without them. The turbines were in the dozens (probably 20-30 of them), and they were so far into the sea that they didn't really ADD to the photo like it CAN sometimes.

It'd be selfish for me to say that they shouldn't add turbines because it affects photography as that would be silly. I'm just saying that it can indeed affect tourism because, especially in naturistic places (grass, hills, mountains, forests, sea) where there's very limited man-made objects visible, these turbines will change that.

I use this only on my arms or legs. It's quite thick and greasy but the white cast is minimal. It's extremely cheap for how much you get, and throughout summer I go through a LOT of suncreen on my arms/legs and it does just fine for that purpose. AND 5 STAR UVA AMIRITE GUISE. I wouldn't put this near my face in any universe though.

**Boots essentials kid sun lotion SPF 50**

This is basically the same as the SPF 30 one, but it has a bit more of a white cast. Not horrible though.

**Garnier Ambre Solaire SPF 50+** (the mini one is exactly the same, it's not advertised as 'kids' but the ingredients list is identical and they wear the same)

Another one for my arms and legs! I use this one on my neck and chest sometimes too. I quite like it, it does stay a bit greasy though. Overall I like it as a body suncreen, and it's a bit more cosmetically elegant than the Boots essentials ones. It has 3 star UVA which is okay, but not the best. I have used it on my face in the past when it was all I had available, and it is quite greasy but there isn't a white cast. I don't think makeup sat too well on top either. So good body suncreen, not the best face suncreen.

**Simple Kind to Skin Protecting SPF 30**

I actually really liked this as a face sunscreen, but it broke me out. Now I just use it wherever I can, usually my neck/chest area. It might be a bit greasy for some, but I have dry skin to I actually quite enjoyed the *dewy glow*. Make up sits okay on it, but it's not like super matte so you could get some creasing. It irritated my eyes a little, but not bad at all. When you first apply it, it's like OMG WHITE CAST but it rubs in easily and the pump bottle is so good! I'm bad at eyeballing 1/4 tsp but this was nice because I worked out 1 and a half pumps is about that much. It would be good for taking around for reapplying because of this. Also very affordable. Advertised as broad spectrum but there's no star rating for UVA which bugs me.

**Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF 45**

I'm pretty sure this broke me out on my face, but I reach for it daily because it's a fantastic neck/chest/back suncreen (and it's affordable). Putting suncreen on the back of my neck and upper back area sucks because my long hair gets all gross and stuck to the greasy sunscreen. BUT NOT WITH THIS ONE. Because it dries matte and non-greasy, I tie my hair up, apply it and after ~15 minutes I can let my hair down and it doesn't stick! I love this suncreen for that purpose. I did use it on my face and I think it broke me out, and for some reason it seemed to not dry down matte properly when I had it on my face? It also burned my eyes like CRAZY. Did not like it on my face at all, but I'm so glad I tried using it for other purposes! Advertised as broad spectrum but again no star rating. 

**Innisfree Eco Safety Sun Gel SPF 30 PA++**

I only just got this so I can't really fully review it. I tested it on my hand and it has no white cast and dries matte. I think this would wear nicely on the face. Due to the low UVA I probably wouldn't reach for this as much, only if I wasn't going to be out long or something and not suring summer time.

**Innisfree Eco Safety Sun Block SPF 50 PA+++**

Again, I just got this. I tested on the back of my hand and it seems to have a more satin-y finish, and has a slight white cast but it can be rubbed in easily. I do like it, though I don't know how this would wear on the face. Not the best UVA rating but it's good enough for me. It seems like a nice suncreen overall.

**Avene Eau Thermale Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50+**

I hate this with such a passion. Let me just preface with the fact I am extremely pale. The white cast is RIDICULOUS. It never rubs in, it's like trying to make 1/4 tsp of diaper rash cream (nappy rash in England) rub in or something. I do sometimes wear it in a pinch, as I know it doesn't break me out. I usually just use makeup to make myself not look white as chalk but it kind of looks odd. AND IT'S GREASY. So when I do wear makeup it all creases up and I'm shiny within an hour even after lots of powder, and I don't even have oily skin! I would not recommend this. It says it's broad spectrum but there is no UVA rating on it. Even if it had like a million star UVA rating it wouldn't save how bad it is though.

**Biore Aqua Rich Sun Gel SPF 50+ PA++++**

Now moving on from my least favourite suncreen is my favourite suncreen! Ugh I love this so much, and as far as asian suncreens go it's really affordable for a lot! I got this for ~Â£6 on eBay and it's 90ml! And it has PA++++! And it has literally no white cast! And it's not drying for me (I have dry skin)! And it sinks in like a dream! And makeup sits well on top of it! And it doesn't break me out! And I put it all around my eyes without it burning them! I could probably go on and on about how much I love this, because love it a lot. It's my daily face suncreen. 

**Coppertone UV Protect Milk SPF 50 PA++**

Not a fan of this one, it's quite oily, definitely wouldn't describe it as a milk because it's clear and looks like an oil. Makeup sits badly on top of it. It doesn't really sink in properly, and I think it breaks me out, but I don't reach for it enough to confirm this. I probably wouldn't recommend it. Plus the UVA rating is meh.

A new/suitable 25-30k seater stadium (or something close to it) in a fairly central place would be brilliant for events like a play-off final (for events that don't quite justify a 50k+ stadium). Each team would have a ticket allocation of between 10k and 15k. This would be mean smaller teams would be able to fill their allocation, creating an excellent full-house atmosphere.

In lieu of a 'new' stadium... the SFA/SPFL should make a deal with Hibs and fill in the corners at Easter Road and let the SFA/SPFL use Easter Road for smaller Scottish international games and play-off games... or maybe even for the semi-final of the league or Scottish cup.

So I could have the best of that world and to be honest, I plan to eventually, but I'd have gone mad if I'd gone to work doing menial shit for 15 years and seeing no progression - but as I say, that's just me.

Chronological order of his 5 goals this season.

In [open play vs Burnley Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFXyqvdHJH8), originally a free kick, but it's not really a set-piece.

[Vs Everton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmrwv5IhlAE) Also in open play. (2nd goal in video as it's the full highlights)

[Vs Aston Villa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOpLTi82mtQ) Goal is also from open play.

[Vs Liverpool](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2fs0dn) Only goal from a set-piece. Not a corner, but a Willian free kick. Anyway, this is the only goal that makes your point. The other 4 don't.

[Vs Burnley Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsxyl9jOD8A) From open play.

[Vs PSG Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW88JQpYjpA)
This might slightly make your point as all of the team is up from the earlier free kick really.

Anyway, the point really is you'd be an tactically ignorant plonker to not think Ivanovic is vital attacking wise. He was used incredibly high up the pitch to add strength and height in an attacking 4 that often lacks it a bit. He is vital to how quickly we can spread the ball across the pitch (see his receiving of high lofted cross field passes regularly at the start of the season to stretch defensive teams). Now the bit you're apparently or hopefully missing is that this all negatively impacts on whoever is playing in front of him. The person playing in front of him has to cover a fuck of a lot more. Willian is the only one who does this remotely well. Oscar isn't awful at it. Cuadrado and Schurrle seemed pretty awful at it.

Why anyone thinks our RM is broken is beyond me, it's performing exactly how it's designed to perform.

You don't design a car and then decide you want it to fly just by just buying wings. You basically build a whole different machine. That takes time, training and probably a much stronger AM in the vein of Bale. Or in ways of simply improving the squad depth, Sissoko for Ramires. And apparently Sissoko thinks he's been scouted by us a bit I rather hope we sign him.

Neither England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland are members of the EU, the UK is, so we should vote as the UK. 

What happens to the UK after that is a different issue, and the individual regions should make their cases in the run up to the vote. If a region felt that membership of the EU was more important than membership of the UK then I guess further referendums may follow in the event of a vote to withdraw.

But the fact lawyers are warning men against Court action proves how bias and broken the system really is. ",null,1,null,1433256057,null,0,false,0,crt05dt,null,t3_387omc,null,t1_crt05dt,null,t3_387omc,null,null,null,1436666556,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

**POINT ONE**

&gt; ""That Tony Blair has learned facts, skills and experience that others do not have, and that we do not have access to.""

&gt; I didn't disagree with that. At all. Read what I said.
 
 This is what you said: 
&gt; ""This isn't even an attempt at an argument, it's just hoping that by being mysterious I can't prove you wrong"" 

That was in response to me saying ""He knows things most of us will never know and he has seen things we will never see.""

If you agreed with me why did you refuse to answer? You refused to answer again in your next message, you just quoted me and said it was an attack then went on some bizarre rant.

""Do you disagree that he knows things that us plebs dont and never will know?""
Like seriously all that you have done is put some dumb words in my mouth and then knock them down. It is a bad way of arguing a point. Try to form another response in which you don't do this at all, or I won't bother continuing. Or don't, that's up to you

You need to calm down and actually say something before you start insulting people. That isn't how you have any kind of a discussion.

**POINT TWO**

&gt;""By accepting the job he is aligning himself as being interested in ending or at least reducing world hunger.""

&gt;I didn't disagree with that. Read my comments.

You very actually did disagree with that when you said:

&gt;""If he gave a single shit about world hunger or the middle east""
Why do you think that he has to? Lots of people don't.

and

&gt;It isn't his job to care. He is being paid to talk, not to care.

**POINT THREE**

&gt;""Working for"" vs ""working on"" is an important distinction.

Except that when you work for a project, you are working on it. When you work on a project, you are doing work for the project. If there is a difference here, it is a tiny little pedantic one and you clearly understood what I meant.

**POINT FOUR**

You claim to have no responded to these next three points as if that clears up your position in any way. Fortunately, it isn't even true anyway.

&gt; ""That a Prime Minister should care about their causes and positions, because it really doesn't pay that well for the work involved.""

&gt;I didn't even respond to that.

That was in response to you saying

&gt;His job as prime minister was to do the roles of a prime minister, not to care

Is that your position? How does that not directly refer to the point I was making?

**POINT FIVE**

&gt;""That being Prime Minister isn't a normal job""

&gt;I didn't respond to that either.

Yes you did! You said:

&gt;Tony Blair is and has always been just some guy doing a job.

But now you're saying it isn't just ""a job"".

**POINT SIX**

&gt;""That being middle east Peace Envoy isn't a normal job""

&gt;And well hey I didn't respond to that either.

But you did, the rest of your comment was talking about both being prime minister, and his work afterwards

&gt; There is absolutely no reason for you to say that he should do this for free. A charity happens to be employing him, but he is still just being employed, regardless of who he is, and he has every right to expect payment for that work.

He is not ""just being employed"". He has a duty to care about the cause.

**POINT SEVEN**

&gt;Did you actually want me to answer if I thought that Tony Blair was hired as a pro-hunger advocate? Did you really want to know if I think that a day as prime minister was just the same as any other day in the office? 

These were clearly lighthearted ways of asking you to elaborate on your points.

If you disagree that he could just talk about anything at that talk, then he wasn't being paid ""just to talk"" like you claimed.

If you disagree that being the prime minister is a normal job with normal responsibilities then how can you claim that he shouldn't be expected to care?

I don't really appreciate the anger and rudeness. You have stated nothing, other than that that he isn't doing anything wrong legally in getting paid. No shit! No-one is claiming that he broke the law in doing this talk. People are saying that it was immoral to accept Â£330,000 from a world hunger organisation, when that money could be spent helping world hunger.

&gt; If you agreed with me why did you refuse to answer?

Because it was a complete non sequitur. Yes, Blair knows lots of things that others do not know. Why does that mean that he should care?

Lol I'm pretty calm though, I was just saying that your way of making a point was dumb. That isn't an attack on you, don't play the victim.

**Two**:

&gt;""By accepting the job he is aligning himself as being interested in ending or at least reducing world hunger.""

&gt;You very actually did disagree with that when you said:

&gt;""If he gave a single shit about world hunger or the middle east"" Why do you think that he has to? Lots of people don't.... It isn't his job to care. He is being paid to talk, not to care.

I think that here you are muddling up the ideas of caring about something and having an interest in working towards it. Anybody can work towards reducing world hunger, that doesn't mean that they should care about it.

**Three**:

The difference between ""working for"" and ""working on"" is very different in terms of big political projects. Though, it is not the only point that I was making with that sentence. It was just the only one subtle enough that I felt the need to point it out.

**Four**:

I said that I didn't respond to it because you accused me of responding to it. Nothing more.

**Five**:

Again that wasn't a reply. You said I replied, I did not. When I said it the context was different, you replied and changed the context. I did not comment under the context of the discussion being whether or not prime minister is a ""normal job"". I never used or alluded to the word ""normal"".

**Six**:

&gt;He has a duty to care about the cause.

No. He does not need to care about the cause to do a great service for the cause. Many soldiers fight and die for a cause that they don't care about. The fact that they don't care about the ultimate cause does not affect their performance as soldiers (for the purpose of this analogy).

**Seven**:

He was being paid to talk *on the topic of world hunger*. He still doesn't need to care about it.

&gt;If you disagree that being the prime minister is a normal job with normal responsibilities then how can you claim that he shouldn't be expected to care?

How is the second half of that sentence at all related to the first? Why does whether or not it's a normal job dictate whether or not he should care?

&gt;You have stated nothing, other than that that he isn't doing anything wrong legally in getting paid

That means you'd have to register only 17 over 21 players. And then you would have to either officially register 8 u21 home grown players or simply forego using those places.

In practice this means the top teams heard talent, don't like letting them play elsewhere because to have a full squad with enough depth to play in all the tournaments they're entered in they need a big squad. This means they end up with lots of players like Rodwell etc. Who could play a squad role, but in practice aren't in the first team plan and aren't really going to play every week, and certainly not immediately.

So I'm not really sure what point you're making. A 43million Sterling is far more valuable to an English squad than any other foreign club, because they can also keep the 3rd striker as a reliable foreigner. Unless of course you buy Sterling and plan to only have him for a year, which I really can't imagine any club would do, no matter how terribly run.

The problem with playing time is that loans can't count to being club grown for the CL, so those aiming for CL also have greater incentive to hoard talent. Combined it's a terrible rule.

It means that he has a moral responsibility to use those unique skills to help the world. Something that he has been clearly attempting to do, but failing at due to his colossal ego. He could have done much more good, but he'd rather become rich at the same time.

In your points three, four and five you say nothing at all. I don't understand what you are trying to say here at all. I never said you replied to any of it, I was clarifying my positions, and pointing out that you hadn't addressed what I said. This seems to be because you are unable to make a clear argument.

Your other points are all talking about the same thing. That it is fine to work on projects like peace in the middle east and world hunger without caring about the causes themselves. 

First I would like to say that I think he does care about the causes. If he didn't, surely he would be doing something that got him a lot more money and power. I suspect that if you asked him, he would say that he cared about these causes, but of course he isn't here.

Am I right in thinking that you think that it is fine to work as prime minister, middle eastern peace envoy, and speaker at events such as this, but not care about the causes themselves? Could a person who does not care about the issues they are dealing with do as good of a job as someone who does? What would be stopping someone in a position like this from being incredibly corrupt if they don't care about the outcome, other than how it will make them look?

If he doesn't care, then he is flat out lying to people. He didn't get voted in because he was efficient, he got voted in because people thought he cared about the right things. He didn't get hired as middle eastern peace envoy without claiming that he was passionate about negotiating peace in the middle east. he isn't speaking at this even because he's a good public speaker, he got hired because he said he is passionate about ending world hunger, and he will talk about how he is passionate about ending world hunger. Is lying in this way morally ok in your opinion?

Finally,

&gt; I'm talking about morality.

I assumed you couldn't be talking about morals, because morally what he does is pretty morally reprehensible. Do you think that morally, he is fine accepting Â£330,000 for talking at an event talking about how we can get more money and resources into the hands of the most impoverished? Add to this that he is one of only a handful of people in the world with the skills to accomplish any real change.

Equally from the spectator side, I like to see what happened, and there's nothing particularly gory about the photo.

Will the growth clearly outweigh the fees?

I will have a read through the broker guide and try to get some more understanding of it all. It's an incredibly complicated thing to become involved in, if you've got no experience

Maybe just to add to this comment - how difficult is it to ""sell"" and close down an account once you decide to pull out?

Entropy is the measure of disorder in a thing. 

Take water, for example. As a solid, it has a regular, ordered structure, and this is what makes it have lower entropy than when it is the liquid state. 

If you think about it, there are many more ways to arrange the atoms into liquid water, than into ice (because the ice has a specific configuration), so probabilistically you're more likely to find the water in a more entropic state. It's a probabilistic argument at its core - namely you're more likely to find water in a higher entropic state than a lower one.

Reduce it to a multiple say x3 of the lowest paid individuals in the country. Due to apprenticeship abuse people get paid about Â£2.60 an hour. An MP should therefore be paid no more than Â£7.80 an hour or Â£273 a week. 

This would encourage MPs to actually stop such wage abuses and low pay indirectly as if they stop apprenticeship abuse they instantly increase their pay to Â£819 a week.

I still don't understand why the coalition government couldn't have amended the HRA to allow the same flexibility, instead of introducing entirely new legislation.

There's an assertion in the HRA that courts ""must take into account"" any judgement of the European Court, but not that the ECtHR's rulings should be followed slavishly.

I don't see why a judge in the UK couldn't go ""Well, I've considered carefully the past rulings in this area, however...""

I look at someone like Gary Cahill who had a 7m transfer fee just as an economic comparison. He was a pretty highly rated defender at Bolton and was 26 when he made the move. Logically we should be able to go after someone similar right? 

Cahill also signed a 5 year, 23 million pound contract. Transfer fee be damned, we can't afford to sign anyone of his quality on personal terms. And this was before he even played a game for Chelsea. 

Phil Jones' transfer fee (a serviceable defender) was believed to be in the 16-17m range. Out of our league again financially. Also assuming a player of his caliber would agree to personal terms with a team of our caliber currently. 

So really, no, Evans isn't great. But we can't afford anyone serviceable. And Jones/Cahill would probably get skinned alive with the Villa midfield ahead of them. 

So does sherwood take a risk on someone who has trained with the likes of Rio Ferdinand and Vidic, and played in European competition? Or does he find a cut rate CB from Portugal with no premier league experience and hope he works out?

Blair and Brown were in Government for a combined total of 13 years. That's 672 weeks they were in Government. The 50% rate of tax came into force in April 2010. The election was May 2010.

Which means in about 668/672 weeks in which Blair/Brown were in Government, the top rate of income tax was lower than it is now.

Yes, the quantity of people declaring they earn more than the threshold, and therefore pay the top rate of income tax, increased. 

How else would revenue increase?

&gt; Do you mean as a percentage of what is normally paid after inflation taking into account the larger population because that isn't true whatsoever

We're talking about a percentage. Percentages always take it into account population, or an increase in the size of the total number. That's literally what a percentage is. It's awfully brave of a chap who calls people ""idiots"" if they don't agree with them on economic policy, when they themselves don't understand a quite simple mathematical principle.

Let me help. We have a progressive tax system in the UK. This means that the 1% of top earners in the UK pay a greater proportion (i.e a greater percentage) of the total tax take (That's all the Treasury's tax revenue, when the whole population is combined) than the bottom 1% of earners, despite their being the same amount of people in each group. Right. Ok.

I am saying, since the reduction in the top rate of income tax, this proportion of the total tax rate that the top 1% of earners pay has *increased*.

The Guardian is one of the more respected media institutes for their objective reporting and that article, which was written by the assistant editor, appears to be saying that in defence of political plurality against the SNP it is okay for politicians to knowingly deceive the electorate during an election.

I'm not saying the media shouldn't be critical of the SNP but currently our media outlets have completely lost the plot regarding the issue. The only one left that has any credibility when reporting the SNP is the BBC, and that is still sometimes marginally suspect (such as when [Andrew Marr had point out that ""the SNP aren't the vietcong""](https://twitter.com/hellobuglers/status/596483183496994816) during the election night).

&gt; The news of the likely arrival of James Milner at Liverpool throws up a few questions, I think it's a very good signing a free transfer who can play in a few positions &amp; got great experience.
&gt; 
&gt; A good character which you can see from the fact he's left Man City in the Champions League for Liverpool shows that regular starts mean more to him at this time than being a squad player with more chance of picking up trophies at City. Brendan Rodgers will have spoken to him about where he sees him fitting in but he's very similar to Jordan Henderson &amp; I have no doubt one reason he's joining is to play in a more central role rather than out wide.
&gt; 
&gt; Could Milner play a holding role? Maybe but I don't think that's what suits him, his main strength is his engine which could suit him &amp; Jordan to both play alongside a holding midfielder (Can?) but his best position is tucked in from the right in a central role which is also Jordan Henderson's so it'll be interesting how those two fit into next years midfield set up.
&gt; 
&gt; Also the fact that Brendan Rodgers wouldn't confirm Jordan Henderson as this seasons captain even though he was captain in Gerrard's absence last season makes me think him &amp; Milner could be competing for the armband!

Just a quick edit to talk about Dividends. Because they are paid out of your end of year profits, they will be taxed under Corporation Tax. In essence, your are paying yourself the final profits, and they aren't taxed under PAYE because they are taxed under CT so it avoids them being taxed twice. The best way to think of them is giving me yourself profits after tax.

It's clear that one of our main problems to curse us this season was a lack of a striker (the loss of Sturridge and Suarez this season) and lack a game changing player (the loss of Sturridge and Suarez this season).

What better way to highlight this problem than to (knowingly and intentionally) field a side bereft of a striker and obviously bereft of a game changer.

Brendan needs a big signing/s this transfer window and what better way to press home this point than to lose 6-1 to Stoke.

They sent a car around the track (an empty one, which they always do after they've addressed any problems or issues, such as sequencing or timing problems), except it didn't complete the circuit, it instead stalled on a section of the track.


This has happened in the past, and is simply addressed by moving it along to complete the circuit, and the ride normally gets closed for a few days while they find out why it didn't complete the circuit.



However, on this occasion, the ride operator has failed to notice that the previous car didn't complete the circuit (either through an error of judgement, or a technical issue), and sent a second one round. This then hits the stalled one, and viola, four people hospitalised. 



And for those saying ""Why didn't it brake or something"", you should know that (as far as I'm aware), most roller-coaster cars don't actually have brakes. That's how they work. Brakes will be distributed around staging sections on the track (i.e. when it enters certain straights, or corners).

I agree with you on his shot stopping, he is great. But distribution, communication and his command of the box is poor, borderline unacceptable. A strong GK is so important for a team, he can inspire confidence in the rest of the players. When you have a GK flapping and unable to kick a ball players start to hesitate and think twice before giving it to him, leading to our defenders messing up by not wanting to pass back.

1. There's a big range of accommodation available, price largely depends on the area of the city you choose to live in. The city centre and quayside are nice but more expensive. Jesmond is the main (undergrad) student area with lots of bars and not much else, Heaton is more mixed between students and ordinary families and is cheaper. Sandyford is right next to the city centre but nothing in the area itself.   
  
2. Newcastle is a very friendly city although you might not be able to understand the local accent. Politically, it is staunchly Labour due to the mining and shipbuilding history.It has a reputation as a place to party because there are lots of bars and clubs in the city centre, as such there's lots of competition and going out is cheap. There's also lots of nice pubs and restaurants for quieter nights out.  
  
3. There's loads of clubs run through the union and sports centre, those dance clubs definitely existed when I was there. I think there is a membership fee but it's not a lot, like Â£5 for the year, but you might have to get a gym membership as well.  
  
4. Newcastle University is in the city centre at the end of the main shopping street, there's the metro tram and bus station opposite the union building. Newcastle has everything you can expect in a city although it is compact so you can walk across the city centre in 15 minutes.  
  
5. From Newcastle you've got Northumberland, North Pennines, Yorkshire Dales, and North York Moors easily accessible and excellent for hiking. There is a very active hiking and fell walking society.

If the fraud went on for a long time, prison is still a possibility.

Rodgers had all season to get us going and, either side of a decent spell in the middle, we were shocking. Painful to watch if we're being honest.

It's not just results either, it's performances. Even during our run we were hardly banging them in for fun and we got a few shaky results on the back end of that form (Swansea for example. Even the southampton game wasn't that convincing, we just had a moment of brilliance from Coutinho).

So what? Now he has another few months to get it right again? We'll see.

The reason he gets berated is because the things he says aren't realistic. When we lose and he says ""we had great character"" we didn't and he's FOS. That's why he gets shit, not because he's being optimistic. 

&gt;but yet when he opts for a realistic statement he's berated again

But it wasn't realistic. We had an extraordinary chance at 4th even after the Arsenal match. Saying what he said was sophomoric bullshit. Fergie would never have conceded that, the old bastard. 

&gt;Truth is, his realism wasn't an indictment of his ""giving up"" so much as it was him saying ""we should now focus on having a strong end of the season and winning the cup.""

Truth is? That is pure conjecture on your part.  

&gt;And yes, teams saying that realistically they can't win the league because a team is in a much better position is ABSOLUTELY similar to this situation. It's the same fucking thing, just replace ""4th place United"" with Chelsea for who needs to be caught in the race. It was United's place to lose. Did they almost lose it? Yes. That doesn't change a thing.

No, they're not the same thing. Chelsea had a big lead where as the battle for 4th was much, *much* closer. Don't be purposefully obtuse. ",null,0,null,1433266543,null,0,false,0,crt70yv,null,t3_388ckr,null,t1_crt70yv,null,t1_crt5wxn,null,null,null,1436670210,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

Wow, you still don't get it. [You even had it explained to you very politely by someone else](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/387omc/no_antifather_bias_in_uk_family_courts_research/crt23gp), and you *still don't fucking get it*.

Let me spell it out for you one last time: the potential selection bias is *in the kind of cases that come to court*. That's what a selection bias is: a bias in the selected data. You can never say for sure that there isn't one because the possibility always exists, you just have to do your best to rule it out. The better you are at this the stronger your conclusion is.

Simple example: a hypothetical football team that hires mostly black athletes. Someone comes along and studies the raw number of black applicants vs white applicants, and finds that black ones are more likely to get hired. Does this prove a bias in favour of black players? No. It could just be that the black applicants are better than the white ones, but you wouldn't know that by only looking at the applicant/hiring ratios. In fact, if you looked at the quality of the applicants it could be that you would uncover a bias *against* black footballers, even though the ones applying (the selection) are more likely to be hired. Amazing!

So to properly determine if the coach is biased we need to compare like-for-like, i.e. look at the fortunes of footballers of equal skill but different races. We might even want to look at other variables, like height or background, lest we confuse a heightist/classist for a racist. Again, the more variables we rule out the surer our conclusion. Can you think how we might transfer this knowledge to studies on family courts?

Beauty of Howdens and one reason it does so well aside from the fact it makes almost everything itself is everything is always in stock so if something does get damaged during installation or find that something has an issue, the installer can just go straight back to the local store and get a replacement in an hour or so tops.

The [Gatwick Express](http://www.gatwickexpress.com/en/tickets-and-fares/buy-online-and-save/) will take you to Victoria station which is very close to the Palace of Westminster (i.e. Houses of Parliament), Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace.

http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/ is a useful website for planning general rail travel, and https://www.tfl.gov.uk/ for travel within London. 

Trains in the UK are very easy to use, in general you should buy a ticket at the station. Around London you won't have much choice as there'll usually be automatic barriers that stop you getting to the train without a ticket. It can be a bit cheaper to buy in advance, but off-peak (i.e. not commuting time into or out-of London; ) the prices aren't bad to just buy when you need them. You don't need to validate your ticket on the platform or any other nonsense. There should be fairly clear displays and announcements about stations.

One last piece of advice; the town next to Gatwick is called Crawley. Get out of there before it destroys whatever positive impressions of Britain you might hold (unless you've a particular enthusiasm for Britain's post-war heritage of New Towns).

You can find the registered office here: https://www.gov.uk/get-information-about-a-company . 

IIRC it's free to get a default judgment, so you don't lose anything by doing it even if you end up not getting paid.

Getting a default judgment means that you win the case by default because he didn't put in an acknowledgement of service or a defence.

If the shop had stopped trading by the time of service, then to be safe you should re-serve the claim form by sending it together with a response pack to the companies registered office as per above. Then give it sixteen days from the date you post it, and if you still haven't heard back then enter default judgment.

Once you have your judgment it becomes a bit more difficult, because you'll want to enforce it. This depends on the location of the registered office somewhat, if it's an actual trading address for the company, like somewhere where they have stock, staff, etc, then you should use an HCEO like Sherforce or John Marstons. They are the people on 'meet the bailiffs' and 'the sheriffs are coming' on TV, and they are very thick-necked and persistent. 

Unfortunately people tend to use their accountants or a similar organisation as a registered office, and whilst it means you can use the address to send documents and mail to, it doesn't help you actually get your money back. There's nothing there for officers to take. You'll simply have to do some sniffing round to see if you can locate anywhere it's trading.

In short, the Lib Dems didn't deceive anyone, and neither were they actually dishonest. They made a promise based on one potential outcome of the elections, and then a different outcome emerged for which they hadn't planned, and it ended up meaning they had to change their stance on several core Lib Dem issues. It wasn't an ideal outcome, but people change their stances on things all the time. This just happened to hit a particularly sore nerve, but seizing the opportunity were both the Labour and Conservative parties who recognised an opportunity to regain seats from the Lib Dems, hence years of campaigning over this one issue.

As such, you have swallowed the political strategy of Labour and the Conservatives, hook line and sinker.

Unfortunately for Labour, they ended up focusing so strongly on destroying the Lib Dems that they forgot their main opponent was the Conservatives, who ended up as clear victors.

The idea that the Lib Dems intentionally misled people is utter tosh. At worst they should be condemned for their lack of courage.

And how much did these players cost? The dearest is Markovic at Â£20m and he was being scouted across Europe.

On the other hand you have EPL (or ex-EPL) players, most of which we've had to pay a lot for: Allen, Borini, Lambert, Lallana, Lovern. If these were the committees picks then they're very poor. Remember half of this group is the one put together by no-money-spared Man City.

null,false,Oomeegoolies,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"I've worked at a theme park, and worked on popular coasters as the operator.

I'm struggling to comprehend why the operator of this particular ride decided to send out one fully loaded before the test run had even completed.  It's not exactly rocket science to operate these coasters. I know where I worked if we'd had an issue and had to run a test, we would cease operations on the ride until the test was fully completed.

Another thing that gets me is the lack of safety precautions on The Smiler.  Not only was the second car sent out before the test was completed, there should never be an instance when a car gets stuck that the car behind it can't be stopped.

A small example to better explain what I mean;

Imagine a coaster with a single lift and a loop, it then rounds a corner and finishes after a very long straight.

Now.  In this instance the car can be stuck anywhere from the loop to the finish if it for whatever reason it does not have the speed required.  Therefore the second car should never really be out of station until the first is in, or if running on a tighter schedule, should never ever go down the drop if the other car is not in (it can be stopped on the lift easily).

It seems as though this very simple thing is severely missing on The Smiler, or it malfunctioned, OR the operator completely messed up on the job.

I'm going to assume that a park with a reputation such as Alton Towers DOES have these procedures in place if a park as shit as the one I worked at did.  Seems to me like a malfunction or operator failure, personally going with operator failure due to the aforementioned lack of regard to the test runs completion, but then again, that might just be the way they're told to operate.
