Therefore, the natural inclination is to expect greatness almost immediately but we often forget that sometimes the final form cannot be realised *now*. Which, of course, is frustrating.

Therefore, I personally try to be as patient as possible and simply look for steady improvements from season to season before they reach their final form; their prime.

One can argue that the prime for a midfielder like Henderson is, say, between 26-years-old and 30-years-old. Henderson is only 24-years-old and does not turn 25 until June.

The steady progression of Henderson should be very encouraging.

He joined the club at 21-years-old and here is the progression that I see in three short years.

* 2011-12: Shit signing. Not good enough. Not worth the wages/money. Liverpool should reach higher.
* 2012-13: Seems to work hard; Will never be a regular in the side; We should sell him while we have the chance.
* 2013-14: His work-ethic is undeniable; He is an invaluable piston in the midfield engine room; His absence may have cost us the title.
* 2014-15: If only Henderson could add assists and goals to his game; OMG-- Is Henderson finally adding assists and goals to his game?

I believe Henderson will become a complete midfielder. He will have the goals, the assists and the work ethic to be a Liverpool player for years to come and a captain.

Will he be a superstar? Maybe. But that doesn't matter to me because in addition to superstars, we also need lads like Jordan Henderson who just put their head down and work.

If you don't have a BCG scar, are under the age of 35, and are likely to come into contact with infected people socially, through travel, or through work, then you may be able to get the BCG on the NHS.

You'll need a tetanus booster, since that only protects you for around 10 years.

The HPV vaccine is pretty recent, but you're only too old for it if you're already infected. If you've had sex, you can either not bother with it or see if you can be checked.

The chicken pox vaccine is also fairly new, but you may wish to speak to your doctor about it if you haven't had chicken pox. It is available on the NHS to people especially prone to complications and to those close to them. 

Another fairly new one you might need is the one against Meningitis C. There was a big catch-up program in the late 90s, and it's now given to infants with a booster for teens. If you're under 25, then you can get a free booster as part of an NHS catch-up program aimed at protecting those who missed out at school.

There are other vaccines that may be useful depending on your lifestyle and travel habits, so you'll want to bring that up.

To your point:

The issue with Dillion and Rankin is they are pish in comparison to Scott. 

What I mean by that is this:

1) Celtic need a player who is good enough to be their captain, not a liability, and capible of european games as well as domestic.

2) He needs to lack ambition, because any player who is good enough to meet the criteria of no1 could easily leave for the PL and better wages.

3) He needs to have a personality that intigrates everyone, friendly and inclusive.

4) Determination and commanding presence on the pitch.

Brown meets all the criteria, and his only 'negative' lacking ambition which is essential in my opinion for a captain to stay the course.

The truth is we could all point out better captains off the field but none would be of Celtic required quality that would want to play in the SPFL.

Be prepared to eat slowly, a bite of bread, a bite of curry, a drink of yoghurt, another bite of bread. 

Different restaurants have different heats - the more suburban the placing, the milder all its dishes will be in general, and also the South of England, outside of London, has much, much blander food than everywhere else. 

I would recommend a Rogan Josh as it is very flavourful, and start with an onion bhaji, which is usually very mild indeed but aromatic. An onion and spinach bhaji would be even better. Saag paneer is also good - basically, spiced spinach and cheese.

One of the biggest headaches I see actually comes from two players who have flown under the radar in the wake of more outrageous player contract/performance ratios - Onuoha and Hoilett. They both signed at a time when contracts were very generous indeed, and they'll both be collecting on these for another year. In this impending future of severe cutbacks, these two will probably be collecting the equivalent salaries of 2-3 players each.

There are a couple of stupid deals which will be even more eye-watering in the brave new world - Taarabt, Caulker, Sandro and Fer. I can imagine the latter three might be saleable but the day might arrive when we let Taarabt go on a free (fuck you Levy and your 40% sell on clause) or, lamentably, loan him back to Italy while subsidising his very steep salary.

At this point I think Yun has done enough wrong as well as right to throw off any suitors. We might be facing a logjam with Robinson coming back though. I have no idea what Robinson's playing style is. Given that we'll almost certainly be lumbered with Onuoha, they I'd go out and pick up a fresh leader at the back. They need someone vocal and authoritative to compliment the other three. At this stage I don't think Dunne can stay functional for long enough. At this stage Ehmer should be making up the numbers.

Hopefully Phillips stays. I'd spend the entirety of the Summer training sessions converting Traoré into a left-winger. I'd keep Henry for the middle, but I have my doubts about him being the charismatic leader to bark at people from the midfield. Not sure what you'd do about Barton. No-one will offer him wages close to anything like he's getting right now. He's just had a house built in Richmond, has a lot of media activities and is doing his degree. He'd probably be down for hanging around locally, so there might be a deal to be had. It largely depends on who the manager will be though - with Barton you'll always be on the lookout for a personality clash. Doughty and maybe Manning can make up the numbers. It would be nice to have Faurlin back for another season but I don't think the club is in a position to be rolling out pity contracts any more, so it would have to be for a Faurlin who can contribute.

Third season on the trot that we'll be in urgent need of extra firepower!

I think as a Championship club we'll lose leverage on attracting players from abroad. Depending on who comes in, we might be leaning on old relationships for a lot of loans.

null,false,HolySheesh,null,null,null,"1) Don't try and not be who you are, just maybe tone down some of your ways. I'll be honest, 99% of us couldn't give less of a shit if you're from the U.S. or if you're from the Central African Republic. Treat people how you'd like to be treated and you'll fit in OK. Don't think that people will be more interested than normal in you, just play it cool. Also don't try hard to fit in with us, don't feel like you have to drink tea if you don't like it or if you go to the pub don't feel pressured to drink pints if that's not you. I think I'd respect somebody a lot more if they were just open with what they were comfortable doing and what they aren't comfortable with.

There are maybe a couple of topics you'd do well do avoid. The topic of gun ownership confuses us here because it's so bizare for us, maybe don't push about it. Also I don't know your opinion on the U.S. healthcare system but don't try and talk shit about the NHS. We're allowed to complain about it but if anyone else talks shit we get awfully defensive.

2) I used to live in Houston myself and have since moved back, I'm not female but I can offer some tips. In the summer it won't be cold that often, just maybe grey skies and the occasional rain. The temperature itself may remain at a minimum of 12 degrees Celsius. You would be comfortable in jeans at all times (day and night). Just be sensible. See how the weather is looking, it might be shorts weather. 

However years of pessism about British weather does a lot to make sure you're never caught out. Whilst the day might start bright and clear and you go out to have a good time it can change and fucking piss it down within seconds so always remember to have something like an umbrella or a cagoul on you. The weather is equally temperamental the other way so the day might start off shit but then change so be prepared for that.

3) Pubs are fine. Sometimes they're historal and ""Hobbity"" (btw NEVER describe a pub like that to an actual person) or some times they're recently built and so less so. Just be sensible. Don't intrude on anyone, don't be too loud. I doubt very much you'll be taken to parts of town where shit goes down in pubs and when you're visiting the football season is over so you'll not get any trouble there. In fact, the cricket might be showing on the pub TV so the atmosphere might be quiet. The main thing you need to do is mirror how others are acting. If the pub is quiet and relaxed, also be that way. It's basic shit that you'd also do at home, don't forget about it just because you're in our neck of the woods.

To get a bartenders attention just stand at the bar, and respect who's in front of you. Don't click your hands or get snappy with them, most bartenders know who's in order and will do it. If you're waiting a lot time then maybe lean forward a bit and try and make eye contact to indicate you need to be served. It's not rude to buy rounds for strangers but I don't know why you would. If you mean you're with a group of your BFs friends then no, that's not weird but it's not expected. A couple group of randomers would be weird to buy a round for. You don't need to tip a bartender every time you get a drink but maybe if you're in a pub for a couple of hours and collectively have drunk a bit it would be nice for you to put maybe £2/3/4 tip in the jar most bars have. You can ask for ice to be put in your window, some bars have utensils for you to use. Cocktails depend on where you go. The pubs you have described as ""Hobbity"" might not, but new design pubs/bars will probably.

Additional notes; ""I've got folks to impress.""-Don't try too hard, there's nothing less cool than a try-hard.

""It's cute that you're loud as fuck""-Um, no? Be respectful. Don't be louder than everyone else, that's not cute that's just fucking annoying. I'll be honest, the tourists who I normally find annoying are Americans because they're loud, so I'd probably respect you/like you more if you just speak at the same volume as everyone else. Never be deliberately loud (common sense).

""Nobody minds that you break into applause for basically anything you find appealing""-Never heard of anyone doing this but whatever I guess it's just one of those annoying Americanisms. Chill with it maybe, some (like cunts like me) might find it annoying.

""You call it a bathroom and that's wrong but so adorable""-Yeah never say things like that, it sounds so patronising coming from an American and it's just plain annoying and kinda wrong (remember you're speaking ENGLISH in ENGLAND so we're kinda good at it by now).

I don't see why we should have foreign people immortalised in our capital city. Do we have a lack of our own important people? No. So why do we put up statues of Gandhi and why does Lincoln have one? What have they done that has benefited the UK in anyway? There is other ways of being friendly to India other than erecting a statue of a foreigner with questionable morals. Statues of Britons with questionable morals is one thing, but foreigners? No. Just makes us look weak. 
I highly doubt India would put up a statue of Churchill in their capital city, so why do we have one of Gandhi. 

There is tons of good things about the UK, it is probably the most important nation in world history. Largest Empire, tons of important inventions and the USA is a direct side effect of our Empire. So we've given the world 2 super powers, the British Empire and the United States.The Maxim gun is nothing to be ashamed of, it would have been invented by someone else anyway.   

Quote from a news source that is totally true
""A statue of Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi was unveiled on Saturday in London's prestigious Parliament Square, a space packed mostly with monuments to men who served the British Empire that Gandhi helped destroy.""

Conditioning can do heaps for persistent muscle injuries (the kind Lamela had for a lot of last season, for example), but not much for structural injuries.  Once you've wrecked your knee once or twice, you're basically just playing and hoping.

Gaurdiola's tiki-taka brand of football (Credit to Tito as much as Pep) demands in such a way that every footballer has to be a ball playing footballer when the need arrives regardless of their positions (even the goalkeeper). Gaurdiola figured out that the best way to implement this style is by launching attacks from the back.

That's not uncommon but what he wanted to do was take the deep-lying midfielders and covert them into CB's or look for ball playing CB's in the market. After some time and a lot of money what he got was Macherano.. many players were bought with the same intention Chygrinsky (CB) being one of those who failed spectacularly.

We never got to see his plan implemented in true fashion but it became evident that he was not trying something stupid.. Emre Can is just the kind of player he wanted but to be able to play like that in a 4 man defense is always tough because your flanks will always be left with a lot of room to be filled and for someone to stay back as the fulcrum/base of the move becomes complicated because 4-man defense cannot spread itself like a 3-man defense.

I always thought that deep down Gaurdiola wanted to use a 3-man defense if he could but maybe it wasn't to be, I maybe wrong though. Either way he did very well.. of which there is no doubt.

I don't mind saying this again, credit to Tito as much as to Pep.",null,0,null,1426423100,null,0,false,0,cpfip04,null,t3_2z27ug,null,t1_cpfip04,null,t1_cpff2ne,null,null,null,1427772561,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

Firstly, I don't think Islam needs reforming. It needs ditching, just like Christianity, because there is no god. The right of persons to practise it, however, needs protecting, as does my right to call it cod.

Secondly, the problem of Jihadis beheading Christians, or whatever, is not inherent to Islam. To say so is to indulge in group blame. It is the individuals who carry out these acts who are responsible, no matter what their religion. Subtly different is this from saying their religion has nothing to do with it, because though it may do, they remain solely responsible, but I'd ditch the dumb religion anyway. If you're going to blame the religion, you will end up blaming Christianity for the Lords Resistance Army.

Thirdly, I do agree that it is absurd to take these crimes as evidence of the West's wrong-doing, and wrong to deny muslim agency, but the US and Britain must accept full responsibility for their crimes, independently of any response from muslims.",null,0,null,1426424972,null,0,false,0,cpfj5yx,null,t3_2z42z2,null,t1_cpfj5yx,null,t1_cpfij12,null,null,null,1427772780,null,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23,null

Parts to get it roadworthy and comfortable £250 (later spent 160 on new downpipes and I've spent countless hours fixing the bike with free access to a well-equipped tool-box)

MOT £30, Tax £60ish

Insurance £180

Helmet £40, one-piece leathers £50 boots and gloves £70

Maintenance (brake cleaner and lube): £10

Fuel: I do 3000 miles/year costing me £450ish/year

Total costs for first year: about two grand if I would have paid for the bike.

As far as passing is going there is no movement off the ball its very hard for him and all we are doing is passing it from the left wing to the right wing. in the last 3/4 minutes or so there was more movement more runs after players passed the ball. Oscar just went missing in that first half and Southampton have dominated us in the air they are just trying to play it over our centre backs for someone to run onto it. We definitely aren't controlling the pace of the game thats one problem, but we just cant win the ball back when we dont have it. He is getting pressed quickly and because there is no movement off the ball he cant pass it or is being forced into making bad passes. We just keep on playing the ball very wide and thats happened since after the goal, Willian was looking great in the first 5 minutes at going into the box and trying to ask questions that has just gone and we've resorted to the usual pass it to ivanovic or azpi and then go back when nothing comes of it. thats letting southampton get organised and the lack of movement centrally is meaning that cesc cant do anything but pass it from side to side. Oscar needs to get more involved.

Nobody is grabbing the game as Sounnes just said. Nobody is trying to ask questions they are just all standing still waiting for the ball to be played to their feet and they will do fuck all with it because nobody is thinking about the next move after they get the ball. they just want it to their feet and end up passing it back.Matic was bad for most of the first half that doesnt help",null,0,null,1426429147,null,0,1426429495,0,cpfkhlx,null,t3_2z4h4u,null,t1_cpfkhlx,null,t3_2z4h4u,null,null,null,1427773397,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

First time this season I've been truly disappointed with Willian.
Terry and Cahill can't win a header.
Oscar again too quiet.
We can't get the ball to hazard when he's isolated, limiting his damage.
Costa always seems to be 1v2 at the back and we can't find his feet.

Wow that was very negative, didn't mean to sound it, honestly.

First of all, it was a war for oil, not a war against Islam. In fact, by today's middle-eastern standards Saddam was a fairly secular leader. 

Second of all, the majority of Muslims in Britain are from Pakistani/Bangladeshi backgrounds. They have nothing in common with the people of Iraq aside from religion - they don't share an ethnicity, a language, a culture. All they have in common is Islam. And it seems to me that getting angry because a Muslim country - that is completely unrelated to you - has been invaded by the west is only valid if you gave a fuck about the country in the first place. Which clearly wasn't the case for the majority of British muslims. When Saddam was in power, happily commiting genocide against innocent Muslims (see: the Kurds) and generally slaughtering anyone who stood against him, British Muslims didn't care less. There were no protests, no petitions, no attempts to prevent genocide. The celebrated Ummah that so values Muslim lives did nothing - just as it did nothing when tyrants across the rest of middle east tortured and killed millions more innocent Muslims and just as it does nothing today when Pakistan continues to work hand in hand with terrorists to murder thousands of innocent Muslims (50,000+ Pakistanis killed in terror attacks since 2001). 

Basically, the Muslim community in Britain is very, very choosy about the outrages it condemns. An invasion of Iraq is cause for radicalisation, but decades and decades of inter-Muslim strife, genocide, corruption and blatant human rights abuses are, apparently, not noteworthy.

Or there may be unintended consequences, like people branding you a bigot. That entirely depends on whether you want to be thought of as a bigot or not. For me personally, I would be rather embarrassed if people thought I was a bigot.

&gt;or what? Sounds like the usual thought police type threat. I'll say what I want.

Well I have been employed by the thought police for a number of years now and was directed to your comment by head office.

&gt;It was ignorant and stupid, but in no way Islamophobic.

It was ignorant, stupid *and* Islamophobic. 

&gt;He didn't mention Islam, he didn't say ""That muslim who I like to call Abu Hamza"" he just called him the name of some terrorist twat

Oh cool, yeah, let's just throw all context aside. It's the same argument used by Godfrey Bloom to defend his use of the phrase ""Bongo Bongo land"". That tactic didn't work for Bloom, and it doesn't work for Coburn or anybody who feels the need to defend his bigotry.

&gt;If someone called me Abu Hamza I wouldn't give a toss

Probably (and I'm guessing here, correct me if I'm wrong) because you're not a Muslim, or middle eastern, so there would be absolutely no connotation involved when comparing you to Abu Hamza. 

&gt;if someone called me Timothy McVeigh because I'm white I wouldn't say it was racist.

Well you're entitled to say what you like, that doesn't change the fact that if somebody draws that comparison simply because you are white then it is a slur on the grounds of race.

The white is the salt build up and the rust is from water drying on the disc. If you zoom in you can see the discolouration of the disc, I don't class that as needing any attention. But the salt needs to be removed asap. Also bird shit eats paint so get that off with water asap too.

At christmas we had a 2 week trip planned to the UK so we could see my family. A few weeks before that we found out we were expecting our first baby and we were so happy we'd get to tell my family in person.

Unfortunately, when we arrived, he was denied entry. They believed he would out stay his welcome because of me (I live in the US with him)... 

After waiting in baggage for over an hour for him, a woman came to find me, asked me a bunch of questions, and told me he's probably on a flight back to the US tonight.

I sat and waited for about another hour until they brought him out, I cried (hormones and scared), then they went through our luggage. They found all of my anti nausea medicine and questioned me, so I told them I'm pregnant.

Then they had me wait out in the terminal (or go home, or whatever, my choice) until they decided what to do with him. 5 hours later after hearing nothing, they tell me he's denied entry but as I'm pregnant he can have temporary stay. 

Anyway. Being pregnant and alone in an airport for 5 hours not knowing what's happening with no one coming to tell you *anything* is scary. I can't imagine what she went through.

Whilst it is true that parents have a duty to be vigilant and keep an eye on their kids it isn't always fair to blame parents.

Picture the scene: your son is tends to be a bit rebellious: skips school, tends to hang around with the wrong crowd, doesn't really spend all that much time at home and you don't really know what to do about him.

All of a sudden he's made these new friends, he goes to the mosque without being forced! He's no longer out with his friends all hours of the night and instead chooses to spend all his time in his room. He perhaps keeps a beard and prays frequently. In short he's become the kind of kid every parent would dream of having: keeps his head down and stays out of trouble... or so they think.

On the internet he's learning extremist Islamic ideology, his views of the world are slowly being replaced by intolerance and hatred, his parents won't realise this until it's too late. He thinks he's finally doing something right, his parents are pleased with him and he's doing something he believes in but in reality he's being brainwashed.

It is so easy to get in to the wrong crowd, where Muslim kids might get involved with extreme interpretations of Islam, British kids might get involved with drugs/alcohol/violence/anti-social behaviour or whatever else.

Now a professional has valued it less and you are unable to afford the higher price even if you wanted to because the bank will only lend on the surveyors price.

Anyways, just because the aim of the GAA is related to creating a national Irish identity, doesn't mean that aim would be served by turning away unionists. Quite the reverse.

I don't think he offers enough, but you have to remember he isn't naturally a right winger, so there's that definite element to consider. Furthermore, you have to remember he really doesn't do a lot worse than Oscar in terms of offensive output lately; both seem to offer literally nothing.

2) It's a problem. We've scored 4 goals from outside the box in the Premier League all season; that's how dire it is. Teams can play with everyone behind the ball, packed deep into the box, knowing full well the odds of a shot from outside the box are almost non-existent. The issue is also compounded by a lack of goalscorers; look through the lineup that starts most games, barring Costa, there isn't a single player there capable of scoring regularly.

3) His inability to produce in the second half of the season is real. I hoped it'd be an issue Mourinho could ameliorate, though there's absolutely no indication of that so far. 

Our performance struggles are exacerbated by the fact that Oscar struggles with the same identical issue, and if I'm honest, I don't think we can continue keeping Oscar and Fabregas next season because this is more likely that not going to happen again; carrying 2 players that should be the focal points of your attack for half a season simply isn't feasible.

4) He needs a pre-season, honestly. Not every player settles into the Premier League instantly; it's far too early to pass judgement given his scarce involvement.

Staying in college is usually only possible when you're a student at that college, so you'll have to look for private accommodation.
Generally, an apartment of your own will be very expensive and possibly out of the price range of the typical student. I would guess you will have to spend at least 700£ a month to find something that's at least somewhat acceptable.

I would suggest looking at spareroom.co.uk and dailyinfo.co.uk to get a feel for the prices of shared flats/houses.

From my experience most places that are let through letting agencies are shitholes, besides the fees you will have to pay on top. On Cowley road you have lots of bars, pubs, fast food, restaurants and supermarkets and plenty of students live there. Headington is a bit more ""secluded"" with generally fewer things to do.
South Oxford, where I live, isn't too bad if you're willing to cycle and quite affordable.
Jericho is the ""nice"" part of town, pretty close to the centre, too, but quite expensive.


Regarding the transition/looking for a place: When a friend of mine moved to Oxford he lived a few weeks in the [NOOC](http://www.nooc.org.uk/), which apparently was quite a nice place to stay while looking for a more permanent home. As they are typically booked out quite quickly I'd recommend to keep an eye on their website. When I moved here I stayed in a hostel for a few days while looking, which is not exactly something I'd recommend, especially as the time around September/October is high-season with lots of students looking for similar types of flats.

As far as non-rent living expenses go: I have found the UK in general to be slightly more expensive than Germany (especially considering Berlin is insanely cheap), which is probably quite a bit worse now (1GBP was 1.25 when I first came to Oxford).",null,0,null,1426434683,null,0,false,0,cpfmtwx,null,t3_2z4kx6,null,t1_cpfmtwx,null,t3_2z4kx6,null,null,null,1427774560,null,3,false,oxford,t5_2rc7b,3,null

""sorry. i'm in a bad mood. 

I find the way people around here dismiss Willian to be very very frustrating. he had a great game today and was one of our best attacking players. he isn't ""utterly useless on the ball"", he is very very good on the ball and is able to take on defenders which is a massive massive bonus. never turns it to product? he whipped in a number of great crosses today and created a number of good chances today. certainly more than any player bar Hazard. Sure a few passes were not great, but Hazard misplaced his fair share of passes and I don't see you mention him. Oscar and Fabregas were abysmal today, yet I don't see Oscar with his own section calling him out. It frustrates me that the imbeciles here just default to ""Willian is shit"" just because of his ""lack of direct attacking contribution"". People here just have so an little idea about football and how different things can really benefit the team, that the only way they can gauge how good a player's performance was is by their ""direct attacking contribution"".

I've explained why just ""taking a shot"" isn't a good idea. we're not in a sunday league, you need very good chances to beat a premier league goalkeeper, and the fact of the matter is that Chelsea just don't have many players capable of testing the keeper from range. you would be complaining just as much if not more if we had been constantly wasting possession taking stupid shots which have a very very small chance of actually going in . 

I don't understand what point you're trying to make with Fabregas here is. do you think we should drop him? change his position? or are you just pointing out his flaws - something that we already all know and doesn't really contribute to anything.

So you're ""not sold"" on Cuadrado and you think we should have kept Schuerrle? good for you. the fact of the matter is that he hasn't shown himself as of yet to be good enough to start these important games, and when the club is really struggling to win games, you don't want to be trying out players who are less likely to perform. Schuerrle did nothing for us this season and could barely get onto our bench. He would not have left if it wasn't the best option for all parties involved. 

why do you not think that remy ""fits the profile"" to be a loan striker? actually back up your claims rather than just make outlandish claims. you want us to play a 4-4-2 with no No. 10? you can have your opinion but don't get upset when people call you out for just making random claims. it would be the same if I said that we should start playing 3-1-3-2-1 because certain players do not ""fit the profile"". and because it would arbitrarily ""benefit the team"" """,null,0,null,1426435654,null,0,1426436887,0,cpfnbdi,null,t3_2z4pnb,null,t1_cpfnbdi,null,t3_2z4pnb,null,null,null,1427774786,null,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2,null

Yes, he hasn't been able to match his start of the season form, but the entire team is playing worse than before christmas. We have way less possession than we used to, and obviously Cesc thrives when we dominate possession. We've been too spoiled by the ridiculous amount of assists he got in the first half it seems, because when he has an adequate game with no assists, everybody is calling him out. Compare him to Oscar, who botched several big chances and sat at a weak 76% pass completion while playing as a ""10"", Cesc isn't even the first person in line who should be used as a scapegoat, if you feel the need to blame the draw on someone..",null,0,null,1426436234,null,0,false,0,cpfnm29,null,t3_2z4pnb,null,t1_cpfnm29,null,t3_2z4pnb,null,null,null,1427774925,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

Back when I played the sport in high school (early to mid 2000s), I got into the sport more, as a lot of my friends and teammates were and they played a lot of FIFA. Most of them liked Man U, Liverpool, or Arsenal. I wanted to be different and chose Chelsea. Me being a high school kid that was fairly new to following the sport had no idea about Chelsea being nouveau riche and the plastic fans. I followed them for a bit because I was and am a big fan of Drogba and Essien. At the start of the 2011 season, I became more of a hardcore fan of the game and wanted to start with a clean sheet. Swansea just got promoted to the Premier League and I loved their story and history from near bankruptcy to going from the 4th tier to the Premier League. They finished 11th in their first season up, played well and played everyone else tough. They have been mid table every season since promotion, been to Europa, and won a League Cup.

null,false,DRBB22,null,null,null,"Apologies, then. Let's go through it:

- Today: he was dire. Had a few chances, failed to put any in, although the header was a little difficult. His ball retention was abject, as was his passing. Poor.

- PSG on Wednesday: Hooked at half time after doing little in the first half. He got Ibra sent off, but you can't use that as justification for a good performance from him. His ball retention was poor, and there was notably a moment when we looked to have a clear counter-attack before he conceded possession because his lack of technical ability let him down in the vicinity of a defender. Poor.

- West Ham away: Played 74 minutes, and he was literally anonymous throughout. Hazard and Ramires ran the show that day, he did little. You can justify West Ham's pressure in the 2nd half as a reason for his anonymity; it didn't stop Hazard. Poor.

- League Cup Final: He played 2 minutes or so, so there's nothing to discuss.

- PSG away: Same story; barely played.

- Aston Villa away: It was a decent showing from him. His run created Hazard's opening goal. 

- City at home: He did little that day, but so did the rest of the squad. We basically had one moment all day - the goal - and he wasn't heavily involved in that. Willian won the ball back, Ivanovic played the exquisite ball to Hazard, Hazard supplied a cross, and Remy obviously scored.

- Liverpool at home, league cup: He played 90+ minutes, and really didn't do that much again. Hazard typically ran the show, Willian supplied the ball for Ivanovic's eventual game winning goal.

- Bradford at home: I didn't watch the game, obviously. But from a friend at the game, and the highlights I watched after, he wasn't particularly impressive.

- Swansea away: Superb showing from him, absolutely no doubt about it.

- Newcastle home: Great showing from him, after an abject first half by everybody.

- Watford at home: The game wasn't on TV, so I can't say.

- Spurs away (5-3): He got an assist in the 45 minutes he played, but I really wasn't impressed by him in that game either. Hazard ran the show going forward that day.


There you have it. In all the games he's played in 2015, he's been incredibly impressive twice, against Swansea and Newcastle in consecutive games. After that, he's played a lot of football and not once has he hit those impressive standards again. There wasn't a dearth of play-time after, there was lots of football for him since then. Is the fact that he's not produced an excellent performance since January coincidental?

null,false,backtowriting,null,null,null,"&gt;Firstly, I don't think Islam needs reforming. It needs ditching

It doesn't have to be one or the other.  Atheists can and *should* try to convince religious people of the case for leaving religion and the benefits of atheism.  But all of us should also be encouraging those who want to reform Islam.  To make it less dogmatic and transform it into more of a historical religion.  

&gt;the problem of Jihadis beheading Christians, or whatever, is not inherent to Islam.

To an extent, it's inherent to *all* monotheism that monotheists will seek to punish those who don't believe in the ultimate truth.  This behavior has been going on since the days of [Ahura Mazda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahura_Mazda) 2500 years ago.  It's nothing unique to Islam.

&gt; If you're going to blame the religion, you will end up blaming Christianity for the Lords Resistance Army.

But I *do* blame Christianity for Christian extremism and the only reason why most Christians in the West are no longer killing the heretics is because the West went through the Enlightenment.  

&gt;the US and Britain must accept full responsibility for their crimes, independently of any response from muslims.

null,false,mycrystalcity,null,null,null,"I just don't think that Willian provides much product, and when I watch him play, he seems to stop at the edge of the penalty box and the advantage of a quick counter is lost. I don't have evidence to back it up. I didn't list Oscar because I thought it was widely understood that he was absolutely awful today and has been for quite some time. 

My lower point about Remy wasn't suggesting 4-4-2, but rather letting Remy compete with Oscar to see how Remy would do as a #10 - just a curiosity on my part.

I see other teams just ""take a shot"" and it works out rather well. We have quality players on our side and I believe that they could create more shots for themselves than they currently do, as opposed to sidepassing on the edge of the box, which is frustrating to me and seems to be what happens quite often. Again, no hard evidence.

I shouldnt have included the part about Fabregas. I was acting foolishly and out of frustration.

Cuadrado needs time to see if he's good enough for us. I liked Schurrle a lot, and I'm probably a little butthurt about him leaving when he did a lot for us in the prior season. A case of rose tinted glasses. This point probably shouldn't have been in my post, either.

When I think ""lone striker"" I think someone big and imposing that can hold up play and take on people. Remy doesn't fit that profile to me, although he appears to be able to score quite well in his time he's had. Again, another probably useless point.

There are my reasons for posting what I posted. I shouldn't have posted it, I didn't explain well enough, and I didn't do the research I should've before posting. So, again, I'm sorry - especially for having a go at you. I was just frustrated and I have no friends that watch football, so I wanted to bitch with friends.

However, I disagree completely about Luis. How can you know for sure that he's not better? He was the best leftback in the world last year but he's been giving, what, 10 apps? I think a Luis-Dave fullback combo would be great but we haven't seen that. 

As for Cuadrado, give me a break. When players get put in a situation where they get limited minutes and no chance to prove themselves, they become selfish and detrimental because they just want a chance to play.

null,false,JunglistMassive,,GLORIOUS RED SAUCE ARMY,null,"ah, The semi mystical quasi religious Laffer Curve; which according to legend was scrawled on a napkin during a cocktail party (Laffer himself has no memory of this), which formed the backbone of Reagan's economic policy.

&gt; It's also a theory which has been widely discredited, both on a theoretical level and in practice. Because with the Laffer curve – perhaps unusually for economics – we have a historical instance of it being implemented by a direct proponent. Laffer was an associate of the Reagan administration, which had a staged cut in the marginal higher rate of personal income tax from 70% to 28%. The effect on the budget deficit was also striking. Reagan doubled it to $155 billion and tripled government debt to more than $2trillion. His successor, Bush senior, was forced to raise taxes as the deficit doubled again. ^[source](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/27/laffer-curve-tax-cuts-rich-funny)

The Laffer Curve itself, almost a religious mantra among the Right at this stage is not based in any way on science or economic analysis but pseudo-scientific waffle on the motivations of ""Entrepreneurs"". 

&gt; It is rather politicians who use the Laffer Curve to defend polices they already had. Despite its abandonment by all main economists, it is still clung to by a small group more driven by ideology than evidence.^[source](https://robertnielsen21.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/the-mythical-laffer-curve/)

[A recent IGM panel of Experts were as equally dismissive of the theory](http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2012/06/laughing-at-the-laffer-curve.html), one panelist, Austan Goolsbee of The University of Chicago's Booth School of Business is quite scathing.

&gt; As a testable hypothesis, however, the Laffer curve has not fared well. Somewhat unfairly, the public has taken the explosion of budget deficits following the rate cuts of the 1980s, and the elimination of deficits following the rate increases of the 1990s, as a refutation of the idea. More careful econometric analysis has not been any more supportive. An extensive literature in labor economics has shown that there is very little impact of changes in tax rates on labor supply for most people, particularly for prime-age working men.
&gt; This would seem to indicate that the central tenet of the Laffer curve is demonstrably false—marginal rates seem to have little impact on the amount that people work. ^[Source](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/projects/bpea/fall-1999/1999b_bpea_goolsbee.pdf)

Or the Business section of Time Magazine,

&gt; While he’s always had detractors, Laffer also had a lot of fervent fans back in the day. But his latest excursion into the public debate has drawn harsh criticism not only from liberal economists like Berkeley’s Brad DeLong  but also from stimulus-hating, anti-Keynesian economists you might expect to agree with the Laffer line. The consensus? Laffer seems to have forgotten, or ignored, some pretty basic concepts in economics. In other words, Laffer is getting laughed off the economic stage.^[Source](http://business.time.com/2012/08/09/arthur-laffers-anti-stimulus-curve-ball-is-a-foul/)

2. I would say yes, definitely. I'd say I wear black tie five or six times a year. Often for society annual dinners, and especially in may week. I just picked up a Dinner Jacket in M&amp;S January sales, add any plain black trousers, a bow tie and a dress shirt and you're in business.
3. I row for my college, and had never done so before Cambridge (in fact I started in third term of first year). Trinity's boat club is called 'First and Third' and whilst it's certainly an elite boat club (their fastest boats are much faster than ours), and will contain many people who rowed before Cambridge, there will definitely be places for novices. The earliest I've ever got up for training is 5:45am, but it does get earlier than that. Training will probably depend on how 'high' a boat you're in, so you'll have some choice in that depending on what you can manage. For instance, I row in our college's third men's boat, and we train 4 or 5 times a week; 3 on the water, 1-2 in the gym.
4. This will vary massively on your lifestyle (whether you drink/go out a lot, whether you cook your own food etc.), but I'd say £100 a week is about right, perhaps a little on the comfortable side. You could live on much less than that if you needed to.

Willian is exceptional at ball retention, he is a good passer of the ball and he can dribble exceptionally well. I won't deny that at times he chooses to hold onto the ball rather than play a risky pass, but when you're like Chelsea who are trying to attack with possession based football, is this even such a bad thing? better to try and build up an attack rather than giving the ball away and risk getting counter-attacked. 

Play Remy as a 10? what on earth about Remy makes you think he should be a number 10? it's things like this that made me disregard your opinion in the first place. We have a team filled with number 10s (Hazard, Willian, Oscar, Fabregas) yet you seem to want a pacey striker to go there... right... maybe you're curious about how he would do, but that doens't make your point a valuable one in a discussion. i'm curious as to how using Courtois or JT as a target man (Striker) would work, that doesn't mean I'm going to make a thread genuinely discussing the idea.

Sure you might see other teams do it, but which of our players are really capable of shooting from range? yeah we have quality players, but just because Diego Costa is a great striker doesn't mean that he can score from 30 yards. John Terry is a quality player, but that doesn't mean he is good at penalties. better to retain possession than risk being counter attacked pointlessly losing the ball with stupid shots. 

Yeah, Cuadrado needs time... do you want us to go into the future and see how he does. it's not like in your original post you were even defending him, only questioning why we bought him! as you said just now - he needs time. 

Aguero works very well as a loan striker, but he is none of those things. Sturridge works as a loan striker, and he is a player very much like Remy. Remy isn't a specific type of striker therefore he cannot play in a position that is arbitrarily only suited to players with your arbitrary skill-set.

that's cool, but ill-thought-out opinions don't belong in their own thread  - that's what the post-match thread is for. when you want to make your own thread with a discussion in it, don't be surprised when people find holes in what you have said - especially when you admit that you haven't properly thought it through.

null,false,Tabathock,EN,england,null,"&gt;1 - I didn't really remember he wasn't a natural RW, so thanks for pointing that out. I agree about both of their offensive outputs - my wife is the Willian hater, but Oscar is just as willing to dissappear and I do think Willian gets involved more, so I'll concede that.

He's one of the most natural wingers I've seen, and he's been brilliant all year. If you think he's ""offensive output"" (yuk) isn't good enough, I'd suggest actually watching him. Watch him draw the wing back, and create space for Ivanovic, watch his clever little crosses, and watch him act as a midfielder when Ivanovic has pushed too far up. Football teams are fluid, and workers like Willian and Oscar allow other more creative players free reign. 

&gt;2 2) It's a problem. We've scored 4 goals from outside the box in the Premier League all season; that's how dire it is. Teams can play with everyone behind the ball, packed deep into the box, knowing full well the odds of a shot from outside the box are almost non-existent. The issue is also compounded by a lack of goalscorers; look through the lineup that starts most games, barring Costa, there isn't a single player there capable of scoring regularly.

So? It's not really a problem. It's only in the last 4/5 games we look like we're struggling to break down teams. Today, we should have won were it not for brilliant keeping from Foster. I bet the same people complaining we're not taking enough long range shots are the same people who winced when David Luiz set up free kicks last season. Long range shots are crap ways of scoring goals, and considering that teams often play with 11 men behind the ball against us, they're even more difficult.

&gt; 3 - Now that I remember it, I do recall the post about his output consistently dropping in the second half. It's a pity, really. Agreed about Oscar, but who should we get, what should we do to combat it?

Worth actually watching Oscar play mate. He's complete quality, but very unflashy. He's just a proper old fashioned footballer with a mean free kick.

Pretty much any player can do that lol. All it takes is one forward pass. Oscar's job as an AM is to actually *create* chances for players around him, or at least for himself. He's usually completely anonymous in attack apart from like one good moment in attack which may or may not be a goal scoring chance. 

&gt;Our movement slows down, we can't break through parked buses and we take more wayward long shots

Actually I feel Oscar slows down our play a lot. Takes him a long time to pick out a pass or a shot.

&gt;The things Oscar does in a match are subtle and often unnoticed - a one-two flick with Hazard to start a move, constant harrying of defenders causing them to play a bad pass etc.

Sorry but I'd rather have goals + assists over all that fancy shit. You're really grasping at straws with this post.

De Bruyne was always more potent going forward. Jose's problem with him was the fact that he didn't do much else going back. But that is something he could've worked at. I really did not like the way we treated KDB during his time here. He was a much better player than anyone gave him credit for, and I said from day one that Wolfsburg will end up selling him for £50m+ in a few years.",null,0,null,1426441436,null,0,1426441649,0,cpfqc3g,null,t3_2z50c3,null,t1_cpfqc3g,null,t3_2z50c3,null,null,null,1427776233,null,7,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,7,null

null,false,Sordid_Sorbin,null,null,null,"As /u/bambinoquinn mentioned, you are being very kind to these players. Most of these players won't be here next season, let alone breaking into the first team. Let's have a look: 
 Jed Steer: As you said, won't be playing instead of Guzan anytime soon. Looks promising, but playing in the cup is all that he can hope for. 

Joe Bennett: He's not a premier league full back, simple as. He's got a decent left foot but he can't tackle, he lacks any sort of pace and he's got no presence to him at all. The championship is his level, though I haven't heard particularly great things from Brighton fans about his performances ever. He'll probably be sold. 

Ron Vlaar: Our best defender, but he will leave in the summer. Unfortunately that will be on a free so we won't get any money for him like you want. I fully expect him to go to Man U and never get another injury, because that's our kind of luck. 

Philippe Senderos: I have no idea where he's been all season. I don't know how long calf strains can keep you out for, but 5 months seems a little too long. Wouldn't be surprised if sold, but he's a decent back up if he ever gets fit again. 

Keiran Richardson: He's past it. He's got a decent left foot but he's too slow for the premier league now. I doubt he's a player that Sherwood would like to keep. I wouldn't be surprised if he goes to a Championship club, or one that as just been promoted to the Prem. 

Enda Stevens: I like him, but he is not cut out for this level. I don't think he has ever impressed for Doncaster and he remains a mystery McLeish signing. I've got nothing against the guy, but he's not good enough for us. 

Sylla: Even when he was supposedly playing well for us in his first season, I didn't like him. He's reckless, lacks composure on the ball and his positioning was poor. Sanchez is better in eery department and Sylla is a player that I wouldn't mind seeing the back of. 

Tonev: I liked Tonev. He seemed to have raw talent but boy was he frustrating to watch. I still believe that with a little smoothing around the edges he can be a good player, but after his racism charge I doubt he will ever a career in England/Scotland again. 

Joe Cole: He'll probably stay more as a mentor to the younger kids coming through more than anything, maybe with half an eye on becoming a coach. I'd like to hear who you think he can be sold to, as I doubt anyone other than a Championship club or someone form Dubai would want him. 

Chris Herd: Puts 110% in for the team, but sadly that effort doesn't equate to talent. I've never had anything against him but he isn't cut out for the Premier League. Wouldn't be surprised to see him go to Australia.

Gary Gardener: It seems like we've waiting years for GG to emerge. He'll be given his chance next season after impressing on loan. Looking forward to seeing what he can do. He seems to have gotten over his injury problems so I'm happy for the lad. Though I wouldn't rule out a possible transfer from a Championship club (poss. Forest) If the money is good, we might sell based on his past injury record. 

Darren Bent: Not a Prem striker. He's a good fox in the box but if you play him you're effectively playing with 10 men. He's lost that yard of pace and can't really contribute to attacks. He'll probably go Derby. 

Tony Moon: Like Bennett, he's not a Prem left back. I do find it interesting that you seem to have something against him and not Bennett. I think Luna is better but was often given the run around when he played due to no support in defence and often being targeted by aerial balls due to him not having any aerial threat at all. He'll probably be sold, though I want nothing but the best for him. His goal against Arsenal is one of favourites from the past year. 

Helenius: Seems a decent player but he wants nothing to do with us. After almost dying last year he wants to end his time in England and will most likely go back to Denmark.

Rooney showed that he really is class today, not with his goal (which was gifted from Bentaleb and Dier), but with his positioning, he was just as effective a target for the long ball as Fellaini.  

Walker is my favorite player so its hard to say, but today was the worst performance I’ve seen from him this season. While his defensive work was passable, he often lost possession through misplaced passes and failed dribbles.  Dier played well apart from the mistake that led to Rooney’s goal. Perhaps Fazio would have been a better choice for this game.  Bentaleb also played well, and would be my MOTM if not for Rooney’s goal.  Dembele was a good sub from Poch I think, but I’m not sure if Townsend was the right person to take off. Chadli also had a poor performance today as well.

Suffice to say there are folk with heavy intellectual investment on either side to either support the theory or subject it to pillory.

More to the point though, I think few could stack up a strong case that Ireland's reduction in corporation tax had nothing to do with its economic turnaround over the last 30 years, ditto the UK's stronger recent economic bounce compared to tax straddled continental counterparts.

Put simply - if you tax something, you get less of it.

Its why there's apparently such consensus for taxing booze, fags and polluting fuels.

null,false,StinkyKlinky,null,null,null,"Pretty solid performance vs a poor side, however the scoreline was a bit flattering. Few thoughts on some of the players:

Baines- I thought he was excellent this match. Defended well and was threatening when he attacked. Once again without an actual winger in front of him he didn't consistently get forward as often but played well.

Jags-  Back to his starter for England form. Past 3 matches he has been our best defender.

Alcaraz- Some people give him a bunch of stick but he is what he is. A decent 4th option. Was sloppier in possession today but did enough.

McCarthy- He was everywhere and easily our most important player.

Gibson - One of the worst players for us. Alright defensively but for someone who's best attribute is his passing, he was off the mark and the cause for a lot of turnovers. Barry played better last match than Gibson in this one.

Lennon - Love the workrate and he is a very good defensive winger. Still providing little in attack besides stretching the defense (whic is important). However, his crossing is poor and little threat of a goal in him.

Kone - Our worst player. Lots of poor decision making and passing from him. Stopped a lot of our attacks.

Lukaku- I still read a lot of people (some Evertonians and more from other fans) still knocking him based on his touch, price tag, yada yada yada. But his form the past few months has been night and day from earlier. Part of this is us playing quicker and more to his strength, but he has also improved his dribbling, passing and first touch. I see a lot of balls into him that he is holding onto that he wouldn't have months before. It is encouraging seeing his training paying off.

Barkley - I was worried that clearance would sap his already low confidence but I am glad he got a goal. ",null,0,null,1426443391,null,0,false,0,cpfre1b,null,t3_2z550f,null,t1_cpfre1b,null,t3_2z550f,null,null,null,1427776725,null,9,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,9,null

Tea tree oil does not cause purging since it does not affect skin turnover nor what goes on inside the pore. That would more likely be linked to irritation - did you dilute the TTO enough (5% is effective) and use a broad spectrum sunscreen?

Are you on any prescription medication? If you are not responding to all the common treatments OR scarring (not PIH) NHS policy is to refer to a hospital dermatologist. Also if you are on any retinoids you ought to have already done the worst of the purge stage.

Cystic acne tends not to respond well to topicals alone even prescription ones, if yours does there may be more going on than meets the eye: sensitivities/ allergies, diet and lifestyle choices for example. Do ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle. Oily fish is particularly important in winter.

&gt; Saving 15k is not difficult for a single person on a graduate salary if they live frugally over several years. I know because I've saved that amount several times over.

I'm going to take the unusual step of calling you out as wrong on this. Because it isn't that simple. It was, 10 years ago. Welcome to 2015, where it isn't straightforward to save that kind of money. Most young graduates are a) not actually in graduate employment. b) those that are in graduate employment are taking home comparatively less than their colleagues were several years ago. When you couple that with the rising price of both rent and bills the result is a narrowing into what people can save. I'll tell you this now as a 28 year old who earns £45,000 a year... it's very difficult to save money in the South East. You'd think people like me would be able to bring home £10K in savings comfortably a year, but it just doesn't work like that. The stupid thing is, people like me could finance quite a large monthly mortgage with room to spare if rates go up... but we can't afford to save £500+ a month whilst also paying rent, and therein lies the trouble. If living at mum and dads isn't an option, or if your job requires you to live in the South East you're up against a wall. I don't think its fair to adopt the old-man position of ""Well when I was your age we used to save £15K a year by living frugally, and we were bloody grateful by-gum!"". When 58% of under 35s go from owning to just 30% in the space of a decade, it's pretty clear something is up and I don't think you can pin it on a lack of austere thinking.

I do somewhat agree on your latter point - the solution is ultimately to build more homes to correct the price and LTV distortion in the market right now. The problem is this will push a lot of current owners into negative equity as their properties devalue, and there is no easy answer to how that is managed. It's also fair to say, if we suddenly start building 300,000 new starter homes each year, particularly these swish new high-rises - the effect could be to aggressively devalue existing stock of that sort of property (1 and 2 beds)... because the quality isn't anywhere near the standard of the newer builds.

Are you suggesting the preachers they would have been exposed to in Yemen did not use drone strikes to further their radicalisation against the West and its values?

The targeting of Jews is based around different motivations from Charlie Hebdo, which had little to do with politics or geopolitical conflicts. Islamic extremists seem to believe it is acceptable to target any Jew because of the actions of the Israeli government similar to same way that they target Brits or Americans because of their government's actions.

* Barclays: overall best app. Updated regularly, lots of services, doubles up as a card reader (for authorising online payments, you don't need that annoying plastics thing). Optimised for iPhone 6 screen soon after new phone came out - shows how on the ball they are with keeping things updated. Integrates with Barclays pingit. Call customer services from within all - bypasses security and you don't have to give any details. Logs on with just 5 digit pin - easy to check balance. Website is fine, although it used to have a bug where it didn't work with Chrome; it would endlessly load payments page and then do nothing. Took a long time to fix but seems to be gone now.

* Santander: Not bad, relatively clean design. Fewer features than Barclays, 5 months after release, still not iPhone 6 optimised - slow to update. The website is fine.

* Nationwide: decent app, decent functionality, just ugly. Recently (couple of weeks ago?) they finally had the resolution update. Has a ""check balance"" feature which allows you to see how much money is available in your account without entering any login details - useful (can be disabled if you don't want it).

* Natwest: issue where when you select payee it just shows one of them at a time, so you have to manually scroll through each payee (ie one swipe per person). No way to scroll to the bottom of the list. I stopped banking with Natwest because of this issue 4 months ago - I don't know if they've updated it since. Otherwise it's fine. Website doesn't work with Firefox.

* Halifax: total piece of shit. Ugly, buggy, and even the website sucks. Avoid!


Keep in mind these are all just my experiences. I'd recommend Barclays, but Santander and nationwide are perfectly usable. Good luck!

null,false,WAKEUPSHEEPLE_,null,null,null,"I'm not saying they're wrong, but can someone give me an actual answer as to why bread is bad for ducks? Like some sort of scientific reason?

Because a lot of the stuff in this article seems like flawed logic.

I'm going to quote all the reasons they give in the article:

&gt;bread constitutes harmful “junk food” for duck

What does that even mean? There are a lot of people who say bread is ""junk food"" for humans, is there an actual scientific reason why it's bad for them? I'd like to see it if there is, rather than the stuff in this article which is pretty flawed. 


&gt;“Bread’s not great for a duck’s health as it’s nothing like their natural diet""

That really isn't a reason... Bread is nothing like humans ""natural diet"" but it doesn't mean it's particularly bad for us. 


&gt;Ducklings fed on bread will end up malnourished and fail to learn how to forage for food, the trust warns, while birds that become accustomed to hand-outs will lose their natural fear of humans and may become aggressive. “Their loss of fear can also cause other dangers, such as a willingness to cross busy roads in order to reach picnickers and other likely sources of food,""

This is obviously not specific to bread, so I fail to see how feeding them other things will help this? It sounds like the feeding of young ducks is the problem, not the thing people are feeding them.


&gt;Uneaten, rotting bread left by overfed birds can trigger noxious odours and fuel algae that can eventually eradicate fish from the area, as well as attracting rats, mice and insects. Mouldy bread can also cause aspergillosis, a fatal lung infection that can wipe out waterfowl flocks, the charity warns.

That's fair enough, but have you ever seen bread go to waste long enough for it to go mouldy in an area with ducks? Because I haven't, the bread is gone within minutes, so I can't imagine much being left, let alone long enough to go mouldy. 


&gt;Waterways can become overcrowded with birds at popular feeding sites, leading to “excessive amounts of bird poo”, where other bird diseases such as avian botulism can thrive.

Again this is a problem with mass-feeding sites, not bread. ",null,0,null,1426447475,null,0,false,0,cpftjno,null,t3_2z4ht2,null,t1_cpftjno,null,t3_2z4ht2,null,null,null,1427777731,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

null,false,prototype45,null,null,null,"People saying cuadrado only had 10 minutes to play, thank fucking god. He was absolutely dreadful. Yeah, he's new and needs time and I wouldn't care if he was perhaps out of position a few times, or not making the right runs, or not finding the right passes, etc.. but he's fucking up simple things like short passes, corner kicks, losing possession *incredibly* cheaply, almost an advantage for the opposition. 

Against Everton he was below average, when he was brought on against tottenham late he managed to give away possession like 3 times in the space of a few minutes, some of the other games he's had some terrible touches and this game needs no explanation. 

A player at his caliber shouldn't have this much trouble adjusting, he shouldn't be messing up simple parts of the game, he's been nothing but awful so far. 

The only time he should start again this season would be if we're 2 goals up. Next season, give him a string of games to get his form back and prove his worth, but for now, keep him off. 

We need to win the rest of our games and he's far too much a liability. 

Other thoughts:

I think people here should really be talking more about Dave. His connection with the players around him are absolutely perfect, he's been solid as a rock and just a fantastic defender. I don't know what else to say, he's been so focused and on his game and I'm incredibly happy to see it. Nothing got by him today, soton's attacks all came from bran's side. 

Costa did well I thought, and Hazard was magic as usual. 

Matic was terrible, not just for the penalty but for how he played from the beginning. Courtois' wonderful save early on came from matic losing his man, he was constantly lunging around not getting anything out of it and looked far below his best. He'll be back though, I don't blame him given his recent issues and fitness, look forward to seeing the titan in the midfield back again. 

Fabregas was awful as well, but what I loved about him was that it didn't stop him from keep trying and getting involved in the game, and it worked because later in the game he played much much better and was making some decent passes and creating chances. A lot of players would just drift off and lose their confidence after having such a bad day at the office. 

All in all I was really happy with how we played in the second half, excellent response to the first half, it's just too bad we couldn't finish it off. 

Also, regarding the penalties. Should we have been given the penalty where costa was tripped over by the soton defender and for the ivanovic incident? The first one was almost exactly like the penalty that we conceded, so I think we should have been given it? Curious to hear your thoughts.

null,false,theninjanipples,null,null,null,"I would argue the first goal was more Mason and Bentaleb not getting close enough to their midfield opposition. Michael Carrick literally had a little stroll and then picked out a simple 15 yard ball to put Fellaini in. Then some blame has to go to Dier who should've been goal side, and you feel as though Walker could've covered with pace. Fellaini isn't quick, after all.

For me, Walker, Dier, Eriksen, and Mason/Bentaleb to an extent, had the worst time. I feel sorry for Walker, as the height mismatch at the start frustrated him and he struggled to get over it. Dier was poor on the Fellaini goal and Rooney's goal too. But then some blame has to go the midfield trio who did little to close down a relatively slow Manchester United midfield. Their passing was pretty woeful, especially that Bentaleb pass. Eriksen had no impact on the game really. If I didn't see the starting line-up and sat further from the TV I probably wouldn't have known he was playing. Mason was similar, though he did look slightly more interested in getting stuck in. After all, it's impossible to press successfully if your team mates aren't.

Rose was okay, Verts was okay, but should take some responsibility, he is a mature player who should lead by example. I mean, Dier is a young and inexperienced centre back, surely Vertonghen should be screaming at Dier to have left the challenge on Rooney and won the ball himself. Lloris was his usual self, little he could do really. Kane was absolutely isolated, and obviously was ineffective. He did make a few poor decisions, but it's understandable that he would be frustrated. Dembele was average, as was Townsend (who I feel was taken off to early). Lamela looked kind of bright, as did Ade. But both were brought on too late.

So I guess the question is do you bring him on now to start trying to build rapport, even if it slows our play, or do you wait till the match would better suit him and risk him not really clicking with the rest of the team. Honestly, I don't know which is a better idea at the moment.

As for the Eriksen - Dembele - Lamela attacking three, and I know this sounds a bit silly, but I actually think it depends on the size of pitch. Today I think it would have been great, Old Trafford is a wide pitch and it would have given them room to come in and play without causing congestion and still left room for our attacking fullbacks to put in crosses.

Well there is a big difference between prepared to pay them and have to pay them as there isn't many alternatives. The later being how the system is currently setup.

Shops are a little different. They actually handle, display and sell the goods on. Most of the trades made in the future's market do not.

We can see this effect recently. Which is where the markets are pushed so high and so overpriced that the prices suddenly collapse. This has happened recently with oil, and less recently with gold.

If you look into the diamond markets the same thing happens. Where we basically pay high prices to the company who limits distribution so they can charge more. In that case the company that do this are so rich anyone who attempts to startup by themselves and sell the diamonds at a lower price simply has them bought by the large companies to prevent the price falling.

After trying to be sincere with him as to why I was skeptic about the whole situation he simply said he was 'bored' and implying I was lazy and just making excuses for myself. After seeing people getting promoted in the business with my own eyes saying that this should be proof that it is legit. However me seeing people promoted doesn't mean anything to me. It doesn't give me any reassurance or better understanding myself. It was a shame that the leader (I won't give his name.) Had to end our conversation on that note of me being still in doubt and feeling as though he is trying to brain wash me. Because I genuinely liked the guy, but I went with my gut and left. I wasn't in a position where I could risk sacrificing so much knowing that it was a all a scam. 

In saying all this, I developed a lot, as a person. You will pick up useful skills working with a company like this as you work 70 hours a week communicating with people constantly. However I wouldn't stick around too long. What they do is very unethical and shadey, and I'm not going to invest months of my time to find that out all to myself and it be late to do something about it. Read the article, because it covers exactly what they do at blue branch, and another company within that office in haymarket called 'Penmex'.

I feel as though the current law as it stands works as a good criteria for identifying morally questionable predators due to their persistence in continuing to try.

This oft repeated narrative is extremely disingenuous; That Cutting taxes created the [Celtic Tiger](http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Tiger). It fails utterly in explaining that since 1956, ROI has experimented with varying levels of Low Taxes. ^[source](http://www.budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2015/Documents/EY_Historical_Dev_International_Context_Irish_%20Corporation_Tax.pdf) ROI had tried desparately to become [a corporate tax haven](http://www.tcd.ie/business/staff/fbarry/papers/Foreign%20Investment%20and%20the%20Politics%20of%20Export%20Profits%20Tax%20Relief%201956%20_FINAL%20REV%20Feb%202011_.pdf) since the days of Sean Lemass, Surely according to the Laffer Curve there would have been a surge in the Irish Economy the intervening 39 years of low tax experimentation?

Between the years 1995-2000 transformed Dramatically, we all know that. However, Corporation tax was at an all time high in 1995 at 40%. 

&gt; The Corporate Tax Rate in Ireland stands at 12.50 percent. Corporate Tax Rate in Ireland averaged 19.20 percent from 1995 until 2014, **reaching an all time high of 40 percent in 1995** and a record low of 12.50 percent in 2003. [source](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ireland/corporate-tax-rate)

Surely according to the Laffer Curve that type of growth in those conditions would be impossible. Taxes did began to get lower to the record low of 12.5, **but all of this happened after the fact**, in fact the biggest glaring omission from the ""Celtic Tiger tax cut miracle narrative"" is that the surge in the Irish economy is directly linked to the joining of the [European Single Market](http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Ireland-GNP-graph-celtic-tiger.jpg) in 1993.

In short, Cutting taxes did not Create the Celtic Tiger it is disingenuous to suggest such a simplistic narrative.

When a Christian, Jew or any other type of religious extremist commits an attack, it's reported as a crazy person on the loose.

The fact is in this country there is a war on Islam, not on religion, but on Islam exclusively. Islam is openly mocked by the government, media, &amp; public regularly.

Where as other religions like Judaism, Rabbi's go to complain to MP's about online anti-semitism (mostly trolls tweeting 'hitler did no wrong') suddenly the government wants ""internet asbos"" for people who criticise jews.

You will begin your quest for rowing excellence in Michaelmas term, where as you watch your skills slowly improve from crabby novice to slightly less crabby almost senior, so too will you witness the days growing shorter. This means later mornings for you. In Michaelmas, as a novice, you won't usually have to be at your boathouse until slightly after 7am. Due to silly new rules about how many boats a club can have out at a time, don't expect more than 3 outings on the water a week, which is very manageable. After a term of novicing, you'll return for Lent term, now a senior rower with a few races under your belt, and the opportunity to aim for a seat in the upper boats. I've seen novices who came in with no prior rowing experience make the first boats, so if you're a good size and can develop strong technique, then you've got a great shot of excelling. Or, conversely, if you're terribly small and have no aptitude for the physical aspect of the sport, become a coxswain.

Second half normal service resumed, and Chelsea hammered us a bit but we countered well when necessary so that we could relieve pressure but also provide a decent threat. I feel both halves and styles of play were benefited in this sense by Long being on instead of Pelle (sorry Pelle's, just for now). He plays well in a counter attack as we all knew, but him and Mané had great movement and caused the defence no end of troubles. Tadic looked much better from the left - something we'd all being crying out for a little while.  

One thing though - My god was I terrified when Tadic stepped up to take that penalty. Not down to form or anything, I was just worried because I don't have the same confidence in any of our players as say Lambert. Maybe Ward-Prowse should specialise in penalties as well as free kicks so that we can have another awesome penalty taker for years to come? He'd get goals that way too.

Personally, I don't care that much. In particular I think MPs' expenses have become over-politicised.

But I do think it's a sound argument to say they're not a necessity of the job.

In any other job, sending these kinds of cards could be considered marketing - they put you in a favourable light with the recipient, who thinks you're nice for sending the card. So the client is going to like you more, and give you their business (or more of it).

In the case of an MP, they're competing for their seat against a candidate from another political party, and money they spend making themselves look good shouldn't be coming from the public purse.

I've read people on here argue that welfare recipients shouldn't be able to afford to go out for a pint, and that tea bags are not a necessity. I mean that literally - I'm not making it up. So if that's the case, greetings cards are definitely a luxury.

Did you even read my post?

The whole of Islam was responsible for these attacks were they? So all Christians were responsible for Anders Brevik?


&gt;You know, the problem with comparing Islam to Judaism is this: People generally see Jews as a net benefit to mankind.

Ironically the way you're talking about Muslims is the way Hitler spoke about jews. 


&gt;Jews have made contributions out of all proportion to their population in science, technology, the arts, literature, music, philosophy, comedy and on and on. Whereas the Islamic world contributes next to nothing in any of these fields and is likely to stay that way unless Islam is reformed.

She explains how to determine which 'class' somebody is by the words they use for things, and Settee is one example:  
&gt;**Settee**  
Or you could ask your hosts what they call their furniture. If an upholstered seat for two or more people is called
a settee or a couch, they are no higher than middle-middle.  
If it is a sofa, they are upper-middle or above. There
are occasional exceptions to this rule, which is not quite as accurate a class indicator as ‘pardon’. Some younger
upper-middles, influenced by American films and television programmes, might say ‘couch’ – although they are
unlikely to say ‘settee’, except as a joke or to annoy their class-anxious parents.  
If you like, you can amuse
yourself by making predictions based on correlations with other class indicators such as those covered later in
the chapter on Home Rules. For example: if the item in question is part of a brand-new matching three-piece
suite, which also matches the curtains, its owners are likely to call it a settee.",null,0,null,1426452746,null,0,false,0,cpfwb3f,null,t3_2z4lf8,null,t1_cpfwb3f,null,t3_2z4lf8,null,null,null,1427779020,null,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22,null

What we've concluded so far is that you don't actually believe this you think it's to discriminate on the grounds of someone holding a British passport rather than an EU one. It's just the scope of the discrimination which you disagree with - you think it should be narrower. 

Regarding the UK's immigration policy, it is impacted by the EU but the UK has volunteered to be part of the EU and adopt legislation associated with this (which it also plays a role in deciding). 

The stats show EU immigration has benefited this country yet you seem to be intent on trying to fix something that isn't broken. It's not on a principled stance either (geographic lottery of one's birth) because you're more than happy to discriminate against those on the basis of them not being British or born outside of the UK.

The bar opened 2 hours before kick off and with an open bar, hors d'oeuvres being brought to the table by friendly wait staff and chefs preparing sandwiches to order, there was more than enough to get your fill before kick off. When we entered we were given 'goodie bags' which contained two drinks vouchers for half time, a raffle ticket, the match day program and a wireless music speaker with the club logo on it. The bar itself is decently sized with a large projector screen to show the lunch time kick off (the Merseyside derby that day - Jagielka's rocket) although I did notice all the tables did fill up rather quickly. The raffle was presented by former players who also did a pre-match analysis type chat and gave score predictions. 

The seats for the match were in West Upper and had a decent view of the pitch, they were also padded which was nice. My one negative point would be due to the number of people using the bar at half time, it is impossible to queue up twice to use both drinks vouchers in only 15 minutes, but it's hardly a complaint that we were given **too many** free drinks. The bar re-opened after kick off for an hour to allow you to stock up on more free alcohol before leaving, and all in all, definitely felt I'd got my moneys worth upon leaving. I also almost got ran over by Didier when he was leaving, but that was the ushers fault and probably not included in the package.

If you're talking about (and I'm not sure if you are) people who work in banks getting paid too much/more than you think they should be paid then the bank will not pay more than they have to, certainly not deliberately. They're not charities set up to help they're employees buy sports cars. The employment market is a market. The talent of the employees is the commodity. They pay some people lots because those people are better at doing what they do than others and make the bank more money as a result.

To say that financial institutions are somehow less value adding than shops doesn't make much sense to me. They don't have physical shop windows but they add value and sell things which people/companies want to buy. All you're saying here is that because you don't want to buy these things, they're less valuable in the round or bad. 

The futures market is incredibly valuable for a buyer or seller wishing to lock in price. You or I obviously have no need to use such things personally but that doesn't mean they, and the services involved in arranging them, don't have value.

I completely agree re diamonds. That market makes Fifa look clean.

Your criticisms of what you term ""the system"" are too scattergun to hold.

Similarly, re tax above, the principles are correct for genuine tax evasion but what you also shouldn't forget is that countries can make their own tax law at the drop of a hat.

The Oxford is near The Cambridge and can be off-putting for a non-local, but now that the festival has passed they're likely to be more welcoming. 

I also like The Steading outside of town near the Pentlands for a country pub feel and a good meal. 

The Captains Bar and Sandy Bells for folk music.

If you opened up building everywhere, and as I said its actually quite close to that already, there would not be a flood of houses, the idea is hilarious.

It helps with business, it can be useful for fun, and that's it.

But then I had bad experiences with the Welsh language (from being illegally put into a special needs class whilst I picked up the language whilst in a Welsh school to a extremist Welsh nationalist primary school teacher pinching and scratching me whenever I slipped into English whenever I was alone with him), and most people I know either don't speak Welsh, or can, but prefer to speak in English because it's genuinely easier.
Plus in Secondary School, there was an expectation in Second Language classes of ""oh you don't know this thing I haven't taught you and you didn't know was even a thing that's coming up later in the year in a class where there was no recommended textbook to revise from?  Why are you even taking this class idiot even though its the first bloody month of you doing this A Level, demoralise demoralise demoralise"".

I pretty much re-learned everything from scratch after I left school, because my teachers were jerks. So, to me, the Welsh language has no cultural identity status. It's just bad memories and a metaphorical screwdriver on my metaphorical toolbelt of skills.

null,false,elementz_m,null,null,null,"Sorry for the late reply. I've been to see the car, and I honestly can't recommend you buy it. As I said, I'm not a mechanic and have only a basic understanding of the magic that makes the cars go. Here is what I found:

1. The mileage is very low. This will mean that the car has done a lot of very short journeys, never enabling the engine to get up to a decent temperature. This will limit the life of certain parts, and is especially a problem for this model and year according to Honest John, because the spark plugs will rust into the engine, and it's a £2500 problem to fix.

2. Aesthetically: This car has had a *lot* of minor crashes. This is very obvious when you look at it in daylight. You see the curved line on the driver's door? That is a massive gouge which has been filled in. Damage to the front wheel arch from (presumably) the same knock. Rear driver's side door has been hit and then straightened out, and is rusted through along the bottom where the paint was taken off. Passenger side door mirror is taped on. All panels are scraped to buggery, much worse than any amount of T-Cut will solve. There may be a lot of rust in places which I didn't see. Also damage to radiator grille.

3. Mechanically: The garage have put it through an MOT, which has involved replacing quite a few parts. These include the rear shock absorber on the driver's side and all of the belts in the engine, as well as all of the tyres. I don't know why the shock absorber was replaced, and the salesman couldn't tell me. The belts will have been replaced because the car was run into the ground by the previous owner, and they would all have been worn out. Similarly for the tyres, they would have been illegal when it was brought in. I had a look at the oil cap, which has been cleaned by the garage. It was probably full of crud from the previous owner never changing the oil.

4. Practically: Everything had been smeared in grease by the garage, but there were still issues with the rear doors being stiff, and some very rusted bits in the engine which they had greased up for some unfathomable reason.

5. The previous owner: A young girl, either history or literature student, who didn't have the first clue about looking after her car. Traded it in for a Saab 9-3.

6. The test drive: They wouldn't let me test drive the car without a commitment to buying it on the day.

7. The salesman: Very pushy, which I would take to mean that they want to offload this car onto the first sucker who comes along. To push through a high turnover on their forecourt, all of the old cars are shipped off to auction if they don't sell within a few weeks. They wouldn't be willing to include any warranty with this car, although they do for their newer cars.

I'm sorry it wasn't a peach of a car, but at least you've saved the train fare up here?",null,0,null,1426454466,null,0,false,0,cpfx7o1,null,t3_2ypvxg,null,t1_cpfx7o1,null,t3_2ypvxg,null,null,null,1427779441,null,5,false,derby,t5_2s8za,5,null

They wished to move back to the UK, and he was able to secure a job (with a salary substantially above this threshold), but they were refused a settlement visa for him as a spouse, as she could not prove that she would be able to support the family herself. This meant that my sister was effectively asked to chose between living in her country of citizenship, or living with her husband. 

When I wrote to my (cons) MP, his response was ""yes, this is wrong, but I don't care""' when I wrote to the Home Office, the response was ""fuck off"".

Historically, the Welsh language has been absolutely integral to Welsh identity, because for a long time after the annexation by England, the language was almost the only defining characteristic of Welshness that remained untouched by our conquerors. At one time, Wales had its own laws, its own ecclesiastical traditions, a different form of social stratification to that found in England, as well as a far more rural (even semi-nomadic, for parts of the population) way of life. 

Gradually, that all got eroded as the Middle Ages progressed. The Catholic Church eclipsed the native Celtic Church, and Wales became included in the archbishopric of Canterbury. Society came to strongly resemble a typical feudal pyramid under the Princes. Poltical independence was brought to an end in the 13th century. The English established a series of fortified towns across the country after the conquest, introducing a more urban way of life into the country.

By the time that Welsh law was done away with by Henry VIII in the 16th century, the language and folk traditions were really all that the Welsh nation had left, and that's the way it stayed for a long time. An English speaker in Medieval Wales (even if (s)he also spoke Welsh, was born and raised in Wales etc.) was a *saes* to the rest of the community - a Saxon. 
________________

That began to change in the 18th century. It was at this time that nonconformism (various forms of protestantism that did not subscribe to the Church of England brand of Christianity) was sweeping the country, and the nonconformists found particularly fertile ground in Wales. Wales soon became a country of chapels, male voice choirs and firebrand preachers, much removed from the safe, tepid Christianity of the Church.

In the nineteenth century, Wales' legal distinctiveness began to be re-established, thanks to laws like the [Sunday Closing Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Closing_%28Wales%29_Act_1881) which applied only to Wales. The turn of the century saw the establishment of the first truly national Welsh institutions: the University of Wales in 1893; the National Museum in 1905 and the National Library in 1907. 

The twentieth and twenty-first centuries has seen a return of a degree of political autonomy - first through the Welsh Office and later through the National Assembly and Welsh Government.
_______________________

And at the same time, the language has declined. By the time it became a minority language in Wales in 1911, conceptions of what it meant to be Welsh were already moving towards a more civic identity, based around institutions and not language or lineage. 

After Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, was founded in 1925, it was long torn in two directions. One wing of the party, lead by Saunders Lewis, espoused a form of cultural and linguistic nationalism. For them, Wales was all about the language, and apocalyptic predictions of its imminent demise was what motivated them above all else. The other wing of the party espoused a more civic form of nationalism. The Wales they aspired to create was a Wales of grand institutions and popular sovereignty. The civic nationalists won, and as a consequence the language has sometimes taken a back seat to Plaid's ambitions of nation building. The party has always remained sympathetic to the language, but it has been less forceful in promoting it than it might have been; certainly less so than Cymdeithas yr Iaith, Bwrdd yr Iaith Gymraeg etc.

Plaid's internal tussle mirrors what has gone on, a little less visibly, across Wales as a whole.

_____________________

In closing, the language is and always will be important to the Welsh identity, but it isn't as central as it used to be and it certainly isn't the case that one must *speak* Welsh before (s)he can *be* Welsh. After all, if we held ourselves to the standards of the Middle Ages, there would be no nation left.

This is what I used; http://imgur.com/QzTsjk3

Left to right, water &amp; autoglym body wash in a spray gun/autoglym bodywash/ autogylm custom wheel cleaner/pagid brake cleaner/autoglym engine and machine cleaner/ ACF50/ WD40 chain wax/polaris grease/wd40 chain lube/cleaner &amp; brake cleaner. Then infront a few of the brushes.

before jet wash: http://imgur.com/Dn0hAOZ
after jet wash:http://imgur.com/hCGWlAU

As you can see the jetwash really doesn't compare to the detergents. Here's the caliper after being sprayed, brushed and rinsed only. The caliper just needs a wipe with a cloth: http://imgur.com/8u8awp3

I spray the bike with the soap and water.  http://imgur.com/mUReR9F

Then with the machine and parts cleaner, I avoid all painted plastic body work and wheels. http://imgur.com/0NZtAF1 || http://imgur.com/Qp3A53G

Then spray the wheels with custom wheel cleaner. This is a light cleaner, the autoglym wheel cleaner is a bit more intense. But I find the custom works fine. If I get grease on the rear wheel I clean it with the machine and parts cleaner on a cloth. http://imgur.com/R9TwE3y

Then I brush like mad. I have a rinse bucket for the gritty crap and a soapy bucket with a small dash of autoglym soap in. http://imgur.com/ctlENXg \\ http://imgur.com/wTPTGT2 \\ http://imgur.com/DxmQepc

I avoid any bearings or rubber seals as the bristles of the brush can push the cleaners in. You want to leave the bearing seals alone really even if they are dirty a light wipe should suffice. http://imgur.com/JkHLJlN

Then.....http://imgur.com/2ml8HsR

Now for the chain. I remove the chain guard and wa la here's what we have: http://imgur.com/WxEI24E

I get the bike on the paddock stand and rotate the rear wheel whilst spraying a good blast of chain cleaner through the chain. Then I brush it to agitate it. Once you've finished brushing give it another spin and a light spray. http://imgur.com/WxEI24E || http://imgur.com/6s5zvV5

I use the plastic brush in summer as the chain doesn't get the surface rust so much then. This brush is useless in winter.  http://imgur.com/Z8PjgKa

Now leave the chain to soak in the cleaner as the bike has been doing.

Go around the bike and attack any stubborn areas of rusty/shitty bits with the right tool so a metal brush on metal, nylon brush on painted engine parts, microfibre cloth for around forks. Any plastic and painted bodywork should be ignored upto this point along with the exhaust. You will scratch any painted parts with a heavy metal brush so look carefully at my pics, you can see where the rust has eaten the paint. This again I brush away and if I was anal id just get a black touch up to seal the paint again. Don't brush any paint you don't want to scratch but remember rust will spread like mould.  http://imgur.com/KAA4iaM \\  http://imgur.com/yCbttuu

Go back to your chain and give it a brush, you might want to use the degreaser on the brush a few times here to help get rid of the grime. Once you're done hose down the bike/chain to rinse away all the loose crap we've removed.

Then wash the bike. I use a waffle weave mit on the paint and microfibre cloths on the wheels and exhaust. I wash sections at a time and rinse my cloth often and soak the bike with loads of the soapy water.  http://imgur.com/JBYJDZx

Once finished rinse it down. http://imgur.com/7sTILWf

Then dry it. I take mine for a ride to get the water out of the chain and the rest of the bits and dry it again when i get back. http://imgur.com/wIdGg3z


Now lube/wax or oil up your chain (I like the wax but I tend to use all 3 as old habits die hard) , grease the stand where it pivots, clutch and brake lever joints, and the foot pegs. If the existing grease looks clean then leave it, if its soiled remove it.

I forgot to keep taking pics about now but I then quickly wax the tank, front and fairings. Polish the exhaust again just a quick once over with a microfibre cloth and the autosol. Then I spray the ACF50 into a cloth and rub it over pretty much everything.

Here's the chain after a short ride once finished, I see some rust on the swing arm I'll need to brush and paint next time: http://imgur.com/9l8aXs0 

Front end finished: http://imgur.com/IIiZ6wx

Sorry for the mega replies dude and everything here is just to show you my results. One of my mates uses old engine oil on his chains. Another swears by wd40 and would drink it if he could. So each to their own but hopefully this gives you a good baseline. Enjoy!

null,false,rmsb,Trinity,Trinity,null,"1) Most of the mathmos at Trinity have not been on an IMO team...although it is true that most of the people who represent the UK at the IMO (and a fair number who represented Australia or other countries) do come to Trinity. Based on my year (at least when we were in years 1-3), maybe as many as 1/4 of the trinmos went to the IMO (from several different countries), and some more were involved in various earlier stages of UKMT camps and training, but that still leaves probably 20 or so who weren't. 

No idea what step grades generally were, it probably came up in discussion in freshers' week but it's not that interesting to talk about really. 

I think that normally about half the trinmos get firsts, most of the rest get 2:1s, and a few get lower than that. This is a very rough estimate...

For all of this, it never really pays to compare yourself to everyone else - worry about how you are doing, if you must, but not about who is better than you are. There will always be some crazy super-mathmo who already knows everything (you know who you are...), but most of them turn out to be rather interesting people. It's not really a big deal what you've done in the past. It might be a conversation starter when getting to know people, but almost no one really cares that much, and there are a lot of people around.

2) Bear in mind you may want different levels of formal wear for different things. I'm female, so can't give exact numbers of ""times I've worn white tie/black tie/other suit"", but I think it's reasonably normal to own black tie and a less-formal-than-black tie suit (these may have common elements - disclaimer: really really not an expert). Society dinners etc. are often black tie preffered, Trinity's may ball is white tie or black tie, some things are black tie or suit.

3) No clue, sorry.

4) I probably spend more like £50 on typical ""buy this every week"" things, but a fair bit more than that at some times in term on meals out/lots of post rehearsal pub trips/etc. 

For some other things I've seen you ask - most people eat in hall fairly often. Trinity's kitchen facilities vary depending on where you live (some places have ovens, some places hobs but no ovens, some places just a microwave). Many people do cook for themselves occasionally, and some do much or all of the time, but going to hall is a good way to be social - it depends a bit on where you live, although in first year you will be fairly close to hall regardless. I actually cook for myself a lot now, but back when I lived closer to hall (and back in first/second year when were all starting at the same time) I did tend to meet friends for breakfast before lectures and normally for one other meal each day. Some people I know eat in hall for every meal, save when they don't like particular foods and buy something easy from sainsburys. Certainly in our first year I think most people ate in hall most of the time.

This whole thing really makes life difficult for couples where the immigrant partner has the higher earning (and higher tax paying) potential. Especially if the UK partner has children and doesn't work (we don't, but that's not the point!)

My EU immigrant husband earns several times the 'minimum' amount as a skilled professional. If he was non-EU we'd have no chance - even though he could easily earn £80,000 here, in a 'non-specialist visa' job. I just wouldn't have the earning power to bring him here. It's quite unfair.

It should be based on the **couple's** earning potential, not the British partner alone.

null,false,Cast_Me-Aside,null,null,null,"While I do think that whistleblowers are routinely treated like shit and need better protection, this story seems to conflate two separate things.

She raised concerns as a whistleblower.  These concerns were ultimately acknowledged.  She subsequently complained of being bullied, made unwell and ultimately pushed out of her job.

Certainly the second thing is a consequence of the first, but the fact that the things she blew the whistle on were accepted doesn't necessarily mean the subsequent issues were valid.

A couple of relevant documents:    
**[Hayley Dare's Witness Statement](http://www.lgcplus.com/Journals/2014/10/07/y/r/q/Hayley-Dare-Witness-Statement.pdf)**    
**[The NHS trust's CEO's Witness Statement](http://www.lgcplus.com/Journals/2014/10/07/b/a/e/Steve-Shrubb-statement.pdf)**

Dare's Witness Statement is 57 pages long, so I skimmed it somewhat:    
a. Various staff raise concerns about Andy Weir *(an executive director)* about, among other things, bullying.    
b. Dare claims she raised concerns and this resulted in, *""pervasive, systematic bullying ... (including comments about my sexuality and gender specific roles, exclusion, isolation, etc) as I had refused to 'sign up' to the 'management approach' which appeared to be to bully staff that raised their concerns and to stop the flow of concerns to the higher management.""*  HD Pg. 9.    
c. Dare decides she has a responsibility to blow the whistle *(but does not yet act)*.  HD Pg. 16.    
d. About a month later Dare is advised by her line manager that Weir has announced a decision *(at a senior management level)* which, *""would have effectively resulted in the overall loss of my job.""*  HD Pg. 17.    
e.  A few weeks later in a meeting the same line manager, *""I was told that I was ""afraid of my own shadow, why don't you just leave?"", and, ""why don't you ask your parents to financially support you?""""* he additionally asks, *""""How do your parents feel having such a miserable daughter like you.""""*  HD Pg. 18    
f. After this she asks for a meeting with Steve Shrubb, the CEO and makes what she considers to be a protected disclosure.  HD Pg. 20.    
g.  Weir is suspended while the issues are investigated.    
h.  An anonymous, threatening letter is delivered which concludes, *""we can do as we like.  You cannot beat us.""*    HD Pg. 25.    
i.  Dare claims that although Weir was arrested and initially charged with blackmail, this was eventually dropped on a lack of evidence and that the Metropolitan Police advised, *""I should record all management meetings, in case I was subjected to further incidents.""*  HD Pg. 29    
j.  At a meeting relating to Dare's employment it is proposed that she move to a role without management responsibilities.  HD Pg. 29    
k.  Dare's GP declines to give her a sick note on the basis that, *""she was unable to issue me with a sick note because in her opinion I was not sick, but had experienced a normal reaction to a diccicult situation.""*  Dare's line manager says she cannot return without an occupational health assessment and that she could be suspended pending this if the GP didn't reconsider her position.    HD Pg. 36    
l. Dare notes *(Article 91)* that she has sound recordings of all meetings after the advice from the Met.  HD Pg. 39  (This is important because it's mentioned as an issue in Shrubb's Witness Statement.)    
m. Dare and a union rep have a meeting with Shrubb in which Shrubb is complimentary about Dare and where Shrubb indicates she should be able to return to her original job or a similar one.  There is a short break, during which recording continues and where it is alleged that Shrubb says, *""She's not going back into forensics.  Our job is to sit down and go through the three options; option one ain't going to happen, is it?  I'm buggered if she thinks she's going to screw me for a load of money and I'm buggered if I'm going to spend money sticking her in another trust.""*    HD Pg. 43    
Two other quotes from that that I think are highly relevant:    
Shrubb:  *""I'll put my money on it if she goes to local services I give it three months before she fingers someone else.""*    
Moench:  *""She's so manipulative, she's so manipulative ...  She's a victim through and through.  She's got that sort of look.""*    

Shrubb's Witness Statement refers to the comments made while she was out of the room at Pg. 10.  He describes the recording of the meeting as, *""in breach of the Trust's policies and procedures."" and goes on to state that, ""I am deeply disappointed and embarrassed to find out those comments were recorded and that Hayley dare then heard them.  It was never my intention that she should hear them and it was not my intention to cause her any distress.""*

Ok, seventy pages of Witness Statements and I'm bored of reading those.

Shrubb in his Witness Statement didn't dispute the veracity of the comments.  As such, while I can't see that the Tribunal ever heard the recordings, I think this indicates that Dare's allegations are accurate.

That said, the Shrubb and Moench comments I quoted would seem to indicate that they genuinely believed she was acting the victim, rather than having been genuinely victimised.  Shrubb stated in his Witness Statement that, *""It is my belief that she did so [recorded meetings] to leverage her position to negotiate a settlement with the Trust.""*

Having spent £90k defending themselves at the Employment Tribunal this view seems to have prevailed.  The problem is that if the Employment Tribunal finds that there was no bullying and no detriment, it can't be as a consequence of the whistleblowing.  Once you get to here it's essentially a vexatious claim.

From personal experience I'd say that the whole of the public sector has a management culture which includes bullying staff and stopping the flow of concerns to higher management.  This means that arguably the treatment she suffered isn't actually as a consequence of whistleblowing.  It's just part of the culture.  That said, it would be a brave senior management team that responded with, ""I didn't bully Dare for whistleblowing, we treat **everyone** like shit!""

On top of all of that, that article states that they've put in an appeal.  This means it's not over and done yet, so Cameron should be keeping his mitts off until all appeals have been exhausted.

That is a massively complex thing to do, the OECD put out a decent framework last year, but nobody is talking about it. 

There is no argument that the Green economic platform is anti-business. While ""corporationism"" may be too pervasive, the ""solutions"" on the Greens policy site would, at best, cripple the economy and kick off a recession that makes 2008 look like a hiccup. 

I'm an accountant and (amateur) economist, and nobody with an understanding of business or macro economics had anything to do with the drafting of that section of your policy platform. Just one example: EC805 essentially ends the pensions industry in this country. Think through for a moment the consequences of that. If you can't see the calamity that would cause then I can only hope someone buys you a copy of Macroeconomics for Dummies for Christmas.

I'm sorry I used the wrong word about Vlaar, I know he is out of contract and that we won't get any money for him. I don't see him signing a new contract for us, and I don't really want him to either. On his best day he is a decent defender, but they are few and far between with all his injuries, so he's not worth it.

I don't really care where Joe Cole disappears, as long as someone takes him off our hands. He seems to be a waste of money. But you have a fair point that there won't likely be anyone that would want him.

The same thing could be said for a few of our other players. Thankfully because of a decent World Cup, Vlaar probably have his suitors, but I don't think it will be easy to off load Sylla, Cole, Richardson, Senderos and Tonev. Cole, Richardson and Senderos are all past their prime, and probably on high wages enough wages that only Premiership clubs or some of the top clubs in the Championship can afford them. Tonev as you say can be hard to off load to any English clubs, and if he wants to go back to Eastern Europe he will have to take a cut in his wages, which I'm not so sure that he will accept. Sylla is a blank sheet for most clubs, and buying him will be a huge risk.

Bennett, Stevens, Luna and Bent will probably be easier, as they seem to accept playing at a lower level, and even cut their wages, in order to play. And if Helenius wants to go back to Denmark he will probably make it known, so that Danish clubs can get him for a decent price.

People are getting fed up of that cynical brand of politics.

East Belfast has been seen as a desirable place to live by young couple and the 'young professional' class for a while now as well. This group seem more receptive to voting for alternatives (Green/Alliance/NI21RIP) based on policies, which can only help. I don't think East Belfast will be affected by the Catholic/Protestant Demographic change, but more the old -&gt; young generation change.

Not to mention, the bigotry we've seen from the DUP corner is very offputting. Almost everyone has a gay friend, relative or workmate. Who's going to vote with a clear conscience for a party who seek to give the OK to deny goods and services to those individuals or gay organisations? Who's going to vote with a clear conscience for a party which stood up for people who forced a disabled dark skinned man out of his home?

Or, if you want to be more analytical - 10 people died during the construction of the channel tunnel. If we take revenue to be  a proxy measure for benefit to society, annual revenues for eurotunnel are somewhere in the region of 1bn euro p.a. which includes le shuttle and various fees to eurostar etc. ~ 710m GBP

Lets assume that Eurotunnel was worth it in terms of loss of life and injury and that there are no more fatalaties or injuries in eurotunnel operation, and lets put an expected lifetime on Eurotunnel of, say 250 years before it shuts down (I figure it's probably quite hard to destroy the channel tunnel and lets make the comparison unfavourable for TG). That makes for a a death rate of 10/250 = 0.04 deaths per year for a benefit of of £710m/year which means benefit to society is ~ 18 billion GBP per life (gee, that's a pretty good value)

Various figures bandied about put the revenue figures for Top Gear somewhere between 50 and 150m, let's assume it's £50m. Which means that top gear is worth 50 / 18 000 = 0.0028 lives per year.

I don't know what the conversion ratio is for deaths per split lip + minor concussion (which, as far as I can tell is the maximum damage claimed). It's also where my patience with google searches runs out. But I think at this point it would be instructive to look at things like relative insurance payouts for various types of injury / death and maybe also something like NICE's Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) to see what the relative benefit is.

Anyway the cost benefit seems in my mind to approximately equal something somewhere between a cut finger and black eye per series, even with this fairly pessimistic scenario. However we have to take into account various other injuries sustained by TG staff which we already know about. I mean Richard Hammond's excursion with the jet powered car almost certainly uses up the quota for the entire lifetime of the show before we take into account various other injuries like the one Jame May had falling off a horse.

Edit: People say you can't put a price on human life but I think you both can and and should. Otherwise how do you know whether it's worth doing anything risky at all.

The two behind him need to also be scoring quite a few but that isn't really happening, we've had to rely on some insane solo efforts to score goals lately which we can't rely on for a long period of time. So we have three options.. a) Buy a new goal scoring midfielder to replace Coutinho (not happening) or b) Hope Sturridge and Sterling can consistently be in amazing form for 70%+ of the season (not happening)  c) Go with a different formation. 

Whilst Ibe and Markovic have both shown a nice bit of promise, I don't think either have it in them to score the amount of goals they should be scoring. Depay on the other hand has shown over the last 2 seasons that he can definitely score a decent amount of goals.

And he can also be played upfront incase Sturridge gets injured, he's a perfect signing for us if we want to be a top team. 

Either way we're going to be forced to buy a striker this summer are we not? we can't rely on Sturridge not getting injured surely! and I don't think there's many good ones available who can also play on the wing.

I bought my 207k 2 bed house at 30 on an income several k less than that with a 65k deposit and money to spare, almost entirely made up from my own savings. It has only barely increased in value since I bought it due to the recession. I managed to save almost 800 quid a month for most of the 8 years since I moved out after leaving uni before I bought my house. I have never had to skimp on essentials such as food, clothing, transport, heating. I paid 5% of my salary into my occupational pension for all this time (the max that the my employer co-paid).

Unless you have dependents, or are living in London where prices really are crazy, on your income you should be able to buy a house by now with your savings.

If you want advice here is mine - two words: Flat Share. If you are in the south east and your rent is say 900-1000 pcm, flat sharing with one person will save you 500pcm plus 50% of bills straight off the bat without any effort. You don't have to compromise on accommodation - for the first year I flat shared in a dump, I moved out somewhere better after about 9 months, by the time I was house-hunting I was living in a very presentable 2-bedroom flat for 850pcm. I took my flatmate with me when I moved out, and house shared until last year (There is a ~5k tax free rent-a-room allowance, so it pays to use it), so he's also paid half my mortgage for that time. Admittedly you probably will be worse off by 9k * 3 - 4 years for student loans, plus any other debts, which I did not have.

The area is booming right now (and has a much bigger Catholic population than people realise, although the sectarian headcounters ignore them because they tend not to vote SF, and might even -whisper it- consider themselves unionists), with lots of young professionals moving in, buying houses etc. People under 30 voting DUP are the minority now, so if the DUP get back in this time, it'll be their last time, hopefully.

null,false,Joe64x,null,null,null,"Well thank you for asking. And I see some people have given some excellent answers I really can't compete with.

I'm not a Welsh speaker. Never have been and never will be besides a few sentences and words that you see on signs and things (Wales is bilingually signposted).

I imagine that for many Welsh speakers it's a source of enormous pride. For me, it's something I'm proud of in the sense that it's something Wales has that no other country has, and you need those kinds of things to call yourself a country.

Does not speaking it make me less Welsh than people who do? I would say that in principle, it does not. But in practice, possibly: I'm a linguist, I speak French fluently and I'm doing a degree in Japanese; the fact I haven't made an effort to learn Welsh is probably indicative that I don't consider being Welsh to be an integral part of my identity on a fundamental level. Although it might not be popular to say here, I am probably more British than Welsh (British, not English).

On the other hand, I have friends who are extremely proud of being Welsh who speak even less than I do. My parents are of a generation where knowing Welsh in my part of the country was extremely rare, but my dad is more proud of being Welsh than I am.

I think that as a German, it's clearly difficult for you to empathise with that because for you, language has never been dissociated from culture or identity (excluding those few ethnic Germans whose countries changed hands during the 20th century). But for us, it's been usual to speak English and be Welsh for many, many years. We have a history of Welsh-English poets, Welsh-English has its own vernacular, its own accent.

Hope that helps.",null,0,null,1426462982,null,0,false,0,cpg1vcn,null,t3_2z4wyy,null,t1_cpg1vcn,null,t3_2z4wyy,null,null,null,1427781684,null,2,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,2,null
null,false,antonvowl,null,null,null,"In regards to 1. I went to trinity as a mathematician without any background in competetive mathematics (went to a state school where we didn't do those sorts of things). 

There was definitely a set of people (maybe 10-20 out of the 50) who all knew each other from IMO type things, knew the cambridge system a little bit from training camps, and also knew a lot more maths than the most of us. And obviously that was a help, they did tend to perfom better in the first and second year, and it was a little bit intimidating (if that's the right word). But to be honest, the playing field evened out. Some of those people remained very good and stayed around for graduate study, but an equal amount did pretty averagely and decided maths wasn't for them.

In terms of numbers, I think around 1/3 of cambridge mathematicians got firsts and about 1/2 of the trinitarians (but it was a while ago, it may be the former number for trinitarians).

I wouldn't worry about being ""out of your depth"", having gone through it (and also taught some of it as a graduate student), I would say that very few people I knew or taught didn't achieve at least a 2.i having put in a sensible amount of work. It's going to be a little more work than most universities, but trust me, it's not as much as a real job. 

In my opinion they do a good job with the selection process (much better than they're given credit for) and almost everyone who gets in has the potential to succeed in the system.

For 2. That's exactly what I did. Some people get by without (sometimes to the extent of going to black tie events in just a suit), and to be honest I probably should advocate for that, but I quite liked adhering to the dress code, it's a nice touch. Being at trinity means you'll probably get invited to at least 1, if not more, formal dinners in hall which are techniclly black tie dress codes (matriculation, commemoration if you're a scholar or on the TCSU, graduation dinner and a whole host of incidentals like subject dinners). I went to a may ball every year as well, and ended up performing at a few, which means another 1-3 events. Get one cheap (and get it a tad too big would be my advice, mine didn't fit me at all by my 4th year, never mind the end of my PhD).

For 3. In my opinion I'd advise against rowing, but it's very much just my opinion. Sports are a good thing, obviously do whatever you enjoy, the social side of rowing in cambridge (at least in my opinion) always seemed a little bit too cliquey and ""organised fun""-ish. University seems a good place to meet interesting people and do interesting things, and sitting around talking about erg times with a bunch of mostly STEM field students always seemed a bit of a waste to me.

Add that onto the fact that they have a solid owner in Bill McGuire, who earned a $1.1 billion severance package from UnitedHealth Group, where he earned $60 million a year.  With his money and their potential fanbase, I could see them being the most popular team in the Midwest.

There's been plenty of good places suggested already. All the museums are good but I would say the world Museum is more 'fun' and less generic than the Liverpool museum. There is of course the Tate which *may* still have on the Andy Warhol exhibition however the hypocrites that the Tate are, it's expensive to get in to the exhibition.

If you are stuck for future places to take out your long list of birds take a ganda at [Independent Liverpool](http://independent-liverpool.co.uk) it's fucking belter for little gaffs to take a fella or bird to (on a later date of course).

Anyway I'll shut me mouth, have a belter and relax. Feel free to PM for some ideas. Safe lird.

You rent the property, or you rent the money to buy the property (in the form or mortgage interest). You're paying rent either way. That isn't to say that there aren't significant advantages (and disadvantages) to buying - just that the ""throwing money away"" argument doesn't really hold.

&gt; Property prices will only skyrocket

There's absolutely no guarantee of this, particularly in London. Affordability and rental return metrics suggest that market values might be unsustainable in many parts of London as they are. Of course, many were predicting a peak ten or more years ago (based on fairly sound reasoning), and this didn't happen largely because foreign investors seem to value London property as a safe store of wealth. It's possible that similar trends will continue to drive prices up, but it's also quite possible they'll fall significantly. 

Also, remember that in general in the UK the stock market (inc dividends) has outperformed property (though not the recent London boom). People see higher returns because they leverage their house-buying with mortgage debt, so see higher returns but with higher risks (I guess you're too young to really remember all the negative equity hell a lot of people went through).

&gt; 1 bed shared ownership

I'm no expert but from what I've read there are a lot of potential pitfalls to shared ownership, so you'd want to do a lot of research to ensure it really makes sense for you. A one bed place doesn't give you the option to share with a lodger if you needed the extra income.

&gt; What are my options?

I've lived in London and around Oxford, doing software dev. I like the Oxford area, but I don't really like London. Even if you like it initially, it's easy to get fed up with the summer heat, noise, traffic, pollution, etc. The key advantage of London is that there are tons of jobs, and it's probably a good place to get your career started.

Here's what I'd do, for what it's worth: rent in London, spending as little as possible (share a place if you can stand to - it works out much cheaper). Enjoy the city but save up some money. Get your career off to a good start, and if you're good your salary should increase a fair bit over the next 5 years or so. By this point you should have the work experience to open up a wider range of job opportunities, have some money saved up, and a better idea of what you want to do next: move to somewhere with a lower cost of living/higher quality of life or perhaps stay in London and buy somewhere.

Personally I don't think London property prices can rise that much further because fundamentally you can't sell something for more than people can afford to buy it for. The very fact you (as a reasonably well-paid new graduate) are in this position is an indicator of this. As is the fact we have these government-sponsored schemes such as Shared Ownership. Even investors with money to spend will eventually be put off by the fact that people can't afford to pay enough rent to make their investments competitive. 

Of course, I could be wrong. As the saying goes, ""the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent"". You could make a killing on further price rises - but it's speculation, which is to say: gambling.",null,0,null,1426464964,null,0,false,0,cpg2whg,null,t3_2z665w,null,t1_cpg2whg,null,t3_2z665w,null,null,null,1427782165,null,18,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,18,null

The Lib Dem policies I most agree with are issues like electoral reform, European integration, raising the tax threshold etc. They seem progressive, have the most sane stance on civil liberties of any party in Westminster, are likely to wield *some* power (though in all likelihood it will be diminished) and don't have any crazy unworkable policies as far as I am aware. 

Which brings me onto the disaster party; the Greens. I was originally going to vote for these guys, but as more and more of their policy set came to light, the more I realised their main target audience are well-meaning simpletons and flower children. They have really bad stances on economics, defense, even the environment (throwing up windmills everywhere in an attempt to source our power mostly from renewable would be an environmental disaster in my opinion. I don't think they realise quite how much you need to industrialise the landscape to generate electricity for the whole country).

Look at Swansea, on a limited budget they have lost excellent managers and great players since they got promoted but because their board of directors have been good about appointing managers who share their philosophy, the team have been able to play a similar style of football throughout (and this goes right back to the Roberto Martinez days when they were still in the third tier) and this round pegs in round holes attitude has meant everybody at the club knows what they are doing and can do it well. It's surprisingly effective.   I'm pretty sure Swansea don't have an individual with the job title ""director of football"" but it's clear to see that the people above the manager have a hands on approach with how the footballing side of the club is organised. 

Compare that to us who have lurched around aimlessly for five years.  We went from O'Neill's kick and rush counter attacking style to Houllier's possession game, we then interviewed Martinez to succeed Houllier which made sense given they are from the same school of thought but ended up giving the job to Alex McLeish who couldn't be more different.  What was the thought process there? Throw shit at the wall and hope it sticks?   

We don't have the budget to rebuild the playing squad every time we get a new manager in who doesn't fancy the players who the last guy signed.   Better to have a consistent line. I'm not sure that means building on whatever Sherwood creates (but I do think he will keep us up and I definitely think sacking Lambert was the right move) but at some point in the not too distant future we should seriously look at having a system in place which doesn't require a complete overhaul every time the manager leaves.

""Oh but rtuck, we need not worry, our sponsorship and funding won't be affected because we're still within the 0.0028 margin""

The fact that you actually responded to my argument by weighing the societal benefits, i.e profit, seeing as (and tbf this is an assumption based off your indifferent rationalisations) you cannot understand the need for the distinguishment between economic advancement and personal risk (ironic because those who often make the decisions are devoid from personal risk);  rather than the personal and financial impact of having thousands of employees complaining of torture and humiliation.

He's more of an Iniesta, in that he needs one behind him and another to make up in terms of covering the ground. He's never going to run in behind, he's a creator and likes to have a lot of touches. He played that role last season and he was majestic at times. Going forward, we may have more trouble as the article talks about because Lallana doesn't make too many runs behind himself and then Sturridge is isolated

I don't think it's been a big problem yet, but as teams figure out the system and play deeper it will be. Where Rodgers has been subbing Lallana/Markovic for Balotelli when we need a goal, I think we'd be better served dropping Coutinho deeper and subbing Allen for a forward.",null,0,null,1426468346,null,0,false,0,cpg4o3t,null,t3_2z5f4e,null,t1_cpg4o3t,null,t1_cpg2hvy,null,null,null,1427782990,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

I also don't think a 1st degree would adequately capture the upturn in form and improvement in the second half of the season. I think those points are caveats that we should keep in mind (as stated), but I don't think the comparison I'm drawing is necessarily biased, or based on any kind of trick. I would even go so far as to say that, if the current trend is maintained, and if the current level of competition continues for the top 4 spot, we'll be seeing results very close to those numbers.

Taking last season as an example; I think a 2nd degree polynomial regression, given a similar point in the season, would have best reflected and predicted our incredible run at the end of the season. 

The point being made is that a) over the course of the season, our improvements in form have brought us very close to the top 4 level, and that b) our form since the turn of the year is better than Arsenal's (which can be easily corroborated by the form table) -- and that if this form had been maintained since the beginning of the season, it would be league winning form.

Man U's regression line is also a 2nd degree poly, but it's nearly a linear relationship, since the alpha variable is practically zero. I think the 2nd degree poly is adequate for reflecting upturns/downturns in form as the season progresses.

Anyways 1 out of those 3 it'd have to be, pretty sure Hazard would have to assault Jose or Roman before they'd willingly sell him. Can't believe we'd sell Cuadrado so soon after buying him and how much we spent for him. 

It then comes down to Oscar and Willian. Jose loves Willian despite his lack of end product and I think one of the selling points for Douglas Costa coming here (I mean obviously he'd want to join a club like ours) would be the fact that he's supposedly good friends with Willian.

Oscar is the wild card, it would be dumb as shit to sell him right now, seeing as he's 23 and still has so much more room to grow, and he's improved so much with us over the last couple of years. And even though I've never seen Douglas Costa play, I'm confident that Oscar is a much better player than him with a higher ceiling. But honestly, I can see the cracks starting to form, the fact that Oscar is dropped every time we play defensively, the fact that he's usually one of the first subbed off, and has been out of form for a long time.

If you want to capture our recent upturn in performance, that's fine, but Arsenal 2013/14 could have also had something similar, which isn't captured in their 1st degree line. 

Regarding the 2nd degree reflecting upturns and downturns, it will only be able to capture one segment of each, i.e., one upswing and one downswing, i.e., it can at most have one turning point. If you wanted to capture more ups and downs, you could do a spline, or a loess regression.

But from a bigger picture, I'm not sure what I think of this line of reasoning. The sequence of 40 games is obviously different for each team, I think this is not being reflected in this analysis. Granted, as you get closer and closer to match number 40, the composition of match history gets closer and closer to identical between them all, but in the earlier stages the sequence of matches can be very different.

They stumbled towards the middle of the season, then won 5 of their last games on the trot. Just goes to show, a simple model can only predict so much.

I'm not sure Excel has a spline function, and I never did learn loess regressions in my econometrics class - we primarily focused on linear, poly, and log regressions -- and mostly on calculations/analysis based on given regression equations...

Well, either way - I suppose my goal here is really just to have fun with the data and some of the trends, and to see how close those predictions are by the end of the season.
