null,false,BenJoudarLFC,null,null,null,"&gt; They were nowhere near in touching distance of the 6th place let alone the top four

That's fair. But by the same token, in our first Rodgers season we finished 7th and was nowhere near 4th. This season we were close if you're considering Southampton close. And considering we had Arsenal and UTD to play, and they played each other, we were close. And OP questioned if we had mad progress.

Hmm, I disagree with your ending statement purely because his tactical knowledge got us close to top 4 this year. There wasn't a player that transformed our season like Harry Kane or Sanchez. He came up with a formation that many were not ready for and we had a brilliant record for 2 months playing good football. 

Since he's been here, he's played 4-3-3, 4-4-2 diamond, 4-2-3-1, 3-5-2, 3-4-3. All of which has been tweaked and some of those have been successful. I don't think he's tactically inept, he does take a while to change. But what could he do at the start of the year differently with Sturridge out?

null,false,Helpopotamus,lfc87,,null,"&gt; That's fair. But by the same token, in our first Rodgers season we finished 7th and was nowhere near 4th. This season we were close if you're considering Southampton close

I've never claimed we haven't progressed under Rodgers. I know we have, but our squad has also hugely improved since he took over too. Thanks to him we have been able to aim higher and become a better team, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't hold him accountable when our new targets aren't met. 

I completely disagree with his tactical knowledge getting us near the top four, and I think it condemned us to finish outside it. At Christmas we were all but out of the race for the top four deeply rooted to mid-table. That is on him. We spent 3 months trying the same thing over and over and over and kept losing. 

You ask me what I'd do to change that? I was begging for Lucas to take Gerrard's place as every team targeted him for his defensive frailties. I wanted us to change something! It wasn't working.

To his credit, he did figure out a way to get us going again. That is exactly what I wanted and it paid dividends. We showed the quality of our squad and did what we were capable of. 

It went tits up when yet again we were figured out again. He stubbornly kept at this new tactic again despite Swansea showing they knew how to counter it. We got done by United who exploited it. Then we stuck with it again at Arsenal, and they did the exact same thing again and we got done again.

Does he change formations? Yes. Does that make him good tactically? No.

Pardew has outfoxed him twice, Harry Redknapp, Sam Allardyce, Tony Pulis, Tim Sherwood etc etc. 

These are not managers known for their tactical nous, and they have gotten the better of Rodgers this season alone. 

I just want to mention I'm really tired, so my points may not be as clear as I'd like them to be or as well explained. I've short-handed a lot of my opinions, so sorry about that.

That's an exaggeration. Right leaning parties only got slightly over 50% of the vote in England, hardly a landslide, and political leanings are hugely regional with a strong urban-rural divide. There's more variation in political opinion within England than between England and Scotland or Wales, so grouping the whole country together as 'right leaning' is unhelpful.

More dismissive sarcasm with no argument.

&gt;A statement of expertise is not an appeal to authority. It's statement of veracity. 
Nope. That's not correct. The mere existence of peer review, or what appears to be peer review, does not convey veracity upon any statement found in a work which has undergone such a process. Problems can appear in the peer review system of any academic field for a huge number of reasons. The word 'expertise' has to be viewed with great skepticism, and deployed only after academic work has been judged on a person-by-person, paper-by-paper, argument-for-argument level. Peer review is supposed to take care of that for us, but there are larger problems in some areas of study, particularly Islamic Studies.

Apart from erroneous understandings which were inherited from poor scholarship in the past, disinterest in the field, etc, there is also the enormous problem of the corruption of academic departments in the West by oil money coming in from Islamic powers in recent times. The Saudis made trillion in the past few decades, and they used it to buy up academic posts with large grants going to academics that produced favorable papers.

&gt; A historian publishes work that is peer reviewed and verified by other historians to be factually correct.

Ok.

&gt; A novelist does not do this.

Again, Naipaul is a 'novelist' when he is writing a novel. This in no way invalidates, or even casts doubt upon, his journalistic work. There may be other features to Naipaul as a writer that detract from the value of his non-fiction, but being a novelist is not one of them. There have been many novelists who have produced fine fiction and valuable journalism and cultural criticism : Dickens, Dostoyevsky, Checkov, Orwell, Vasily Grossman, and many, many others. One cannot dismiss a work of journalism, travelogue, and political and cultural commentary by a writer simply because he wrote a novel. It's a bad argument, full stop.

&gt;This is how the western University system works. I mean academics don't just publish stuff because hey, they felt like it, it's peer reviewed and checked - or there would really be no point in reading those books if they are just as valid as what ever you dribbled onto a keyboard.

Actually, this is unfortunately how a lot of academic work gets published. Just look at the field of postmodern 'critical theory'. Various sub-fields of the humanities have been poisoned by this nonsense, and some work produced under the umbrella Islamic Studies are among these.


&gt; Obviously. That means you should really keep your opinion on a comparison between Naipaul and her to yourself.

Interesting. Where did I write an opinion a comparison between Naipaul and Schimmel above? I did no such thing. I specifically wrote  I'll withhold judgement, while maintaining some skepticism due to her receiving accolades from Islamic groups. Why should I keep an opinion to myself, when I have not aired such an opinion? Could it be that you want me to be silent, because you have no argument? I'll say whatever opinions I want to, and if you don't like it, you can kiss my ass.

&gt; Not really, his work is controversial, but it's not been ""exploded"", unless you've been reading people like Daniel Pipes and Robert Spencer, who are in the minority and are really upset about his undermining of their favorite scholars. 
 Said's work has indeed been shown to be a blast of hot air. It simply isn't true to say that Orientalist scholarship was created as a tool of Western imperialism. It may have contributed to such imperialism, but that's not what its purpose was. Ibn Warraq's demolition of Said in his Defending The West is total. Warraq shows how Said systematically misrepresents the scholars whom he is supposed to be dissecting. Robert Irwin's Dangerous Knowledge does much the same, but with more a historian's eye, rather than Warraq's polemical style. His book is riddled with errors and elisions. The effect is just as devastating. I'll leave you to write a systematic takedown of those two books, together running ~739 pages with hundreds of footnotes. Let me know when you're done. I'd love to read it.


&gt;In fact Said's work is seen horrendously important for blowing the cobwebs off the fields it impacts and challenging ME scholars to come up with better narrative of what has happened. It's led to immensely important work that has re-examined the power relationship in the ME and the subsequent history of the ME. Everyone from Vali Nasr , all the way down to Wilfred Madelung owes something to him. That's a huge range of scholars over vast disciplines.

One thing that Said's defenders often leave out: Said himself was enormously disappointed by the political effect that his thesis had in the Arab world. He was a liberal and a Marxist, but instead found his arguments being repeated by the most reactionary forces in the Arab world. What shame.. :(

? This Naipaul's work? He wouldn't know a good translation from a bad one, he doesn't speak Arabic. He doesn't understand classical Persian or Urdu for that matter - which most of the court documentation of South Asian was written in. Also he doesn't speak Hindi or read it, or Sanksrit, or Tamil, or Sinhalese - as he doesn't speak any South Asian languages.

&gt; Alright which idiot on Jihadwatch made that nonsense up? 

It's not made up. It's notorious among anyone who has studied the subject. Look at the membership of MESA, for example. Ever since the 70's its membership has been supplanted by a large number Middle Easterners. That this happened at the same time that the Saudis and others came into their oil billions is no accident. The nonsense pumped out by Juan Cole, who argues, apparently with a straight face, that jihadist atrocities are caused by social and political forces, not religious belief. The fact that he was a convert to the Shia Bahai sect probably helped him get his job as a despised hireling of Islamic oil baronies.  

As for Montgomery Watt, that he was conservative Christian apologist for Islam is notorious among serious academeic historians of Islam:  Patricia Crone, Michael Cook, David Cook have all written this. Watt viewed Islam as a potential ally in the battle against Godless Communism. You see this in his books, and in the fact that his biography of Muhammad is cited by Muslim clerics.

&gt; At this stage you'll have realised you're talking to someone who know what they're talking about when it comes to the ME. Having lived, worked there and studied it.

I've realized that I'm talking with someone who urgently wants to torpedo any criticism of Islam, but doesn't actually have any good arguments, so tries to distract readers with with a bunch red herrings and hot air.

&gt; You however, are most definitely in a bubble if you think Monty Watt was jihadi stooge

As I said above, that Watt was an apologist for Islam is notorious. Warraq sums up the case here, which I'll leave you to ponder

Blaming BVB's issues on Klopp seems incredibly unfair to me. It's widely acknowledged that teams relying on high energy pressing strategies fade over time. This is where the three-year-rule really comes into play (here's an excellent article by Jonathan Wilson further describing this phenomenon). Unless a club performs excellently in the transfer market and can bring capable in players that immediately fit their system this decay is inevitable. Because BVB play this high pressing system they need players with great stamina, and excellent tactical knowledge to be able to work as a unit in their pressing, something that is very hard to find in the transfer market at a reasonable price. Each year Bayern has been handpicking their best players, especially the players he builds his system around, making it even harder for Klopp to build and sustain his successful record. Furthermore, such a high pressing style requires players to be in excellent physical shape. This requires a superb fitness coach and training staff. Dortmund just lost Oliver Bartlett, their excellent fitness coach and have clearly not been the same since as injuries have increased and older players have looked more and more tired. Eventually they were going to slip up. However, through all that Klopp performed above average in the CL (especially considering their league form at the time), made it to the DFB-Pokal Cup, won the DFL Supercup, and escaped a relegation scrap to make it to the Europa League (where we're headed as well). Yes, we've had injuries and transfer issues but BVB's system and form were unsustainable; especially in the past few years they were hurt by issues outside of Klopp's control but he's still salvaged their season.",null,0,null,1431921655,null,0,false,0,crcmj00,null,t3_36a7a1,null,t1_crcmj00,null,t1_crc7vvd,null,null,null,1433123935,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

* Sven Bender - two years left on contract, and could leave if Dortmund get poached when Klopp leaves. Much like Aubameyang.

* Timo Horn from FC Koln. Amazing young keeper, future Germany #1/#2, and is playing for a bottom-half of the table club. Alternatively, Handanovic is experienced, Inter have missed out on CL, and only has 1 year on his contract.

* Andre Ayew - Free agent from Marseille, low wage demands, huge LFC fan, can play across midfield and consistently score 10+ goals per season. Obvious the goals may not translate into 10+ EPL goals, but he could be great cover and competition for Ibe/Origi if LFC decides to sell Sterling.

* Janmaat - Pure quality RB, would easily be our starter. Works hard, loads of experience, and we're a hell of an upgrade from Newcastle.

There's a lot that I find wrong with this that I'm having trouble articulating.

&gt; for it to be a genuine deterrent each side has to believe that the other would be willing to use their weapons

In some future scenario, yes.

&gt;but each side knows the other wouldn't use their weapons because the retaliation would be so great... so it's really just business as usual.

That's completely the point - read what you're writing. Once one power has nukes, the rest need to have nukes to ensure that they're not used - so that it *is* business as usual.


On your point about Ukraine:

Firstly I think it's a special case where the defendant doesn't have a capable army - meaning that they *could* be invaded without mass warfare. 

If Ukraine had a large capable army (as other nuke nations do), Russia would had to have escalated the campaign to achieve similar results. In this situation, civilian death potential would be far larger, ground forces would be more numerous and if Ukraine was losing and told the Kremlin ""we're not going to lose, we're going to nuke Moscow"", I imagine Russia would've backed off.

While the depths of the Vanguard class submarine aren't public knowledge, it's going to be deeper than 65 meters.

Purely as an educated guess, 65m is going to be either patrol depth or launch/hover depth.  One being rather close to the other, as going too far down impedes their ability to receive orders in a timely manner, which is a large part of their job description.  It'd also impede them coming to launch depth in a timely manner, which is pretty much the other half of their job description.

The US Ohio-class, the US trident boats that are the closest equivalent to the Vanguard class, publish their test depth as ""in excess of 800ft"" - about 240m.  And published figures are usually incredibly conservative.

I would be very, very surprised if ours isn't suspiciously similar.  I'd be even more surprised if it was 65m, leaving such a fragile margin between test depth and operational depth.

Under international convention we'd have our own 200 mile exclusive fishing zone, like Iceland, Norway, New Zealand and many more.

We'd be able to significantly reduce the cost of living, not only through cheaper food (an estimated 17% reduction for the average family), but it opens up the only viable way to actually reduce energy bills too.  That's savings not only for our services, but a ubiquitous saving for domestic use and manufacturing.

But perhaps most enticing is the prospect to make good on the Singapore declaration where over 50 countries pledged to aspire for freer trade with the UK, but the UK has been unable to capitalise with free trade negotiations having to go through the commission.  There's even growing talk now of the potential to 'do a Singapore' and drop all tariffs across the board.  A true beacon of free trade in a 21st century.

If you want to be part of the common market then you absolutely do. There is no serious economic argument for leaving the common market. That would entail either our manufacturers creating products which do not meet EU/EEA standards and thus being  unsellable there. Or it would entail our manufacturers spending extra money making two products for the UK and EU (of course small British businesses would be cut out entirely as they would not be able to afford this). Or it would entail us agreeing to EU/EEA standards anyway as Norway does and we're back to square one, following the same EU trade laws but with no vote on how the rules are made.

- The group displays excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader and (whether he is alive or dead) regards his belief system, ideology, and practices as the Truth, as law.

- Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.

- The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leader(s) and members 

- The group has a polarized us-versus-them mentality, which may cause conflict with the wider society.

- The leader is not accountable to any authorities

- The group teaches or implies that its supposedly exalted ends justify whatever means it deems necessary. This may result in members' participating in behaviors or activities they would have considered reprehensible or unethical before joining the group 



Didn't really need to write this though - the frothy madness, bile and fury from Sinn Fein folk at one article suggesting their leader's poo doesn't smell of roses actually is all the supporting material to RDE's opinion piece that is required.

In regards to his nickname might be true, people from NI tend to get nicknames either by last name, get Called paddy or some sort of joking nickname about the IRA, I knew a guy and he was called Semtex, it wasn't bullying that's just how nicknames in the RN work and always have done you take it with some worth of pride, mine was a Girls name I won't say what because it actually tells you what my last name is (and I dont want to get stalked).

The part about test scores and picking a number is utter bollox, the RN take that shit seriously, no fuckin about they have no problems in failing you and if you keep failing they discharge you for being a stupid cunt.

As for Trident and budget, they money for Trident doesn't come from the defence money, its specially paid for by the treasury directly, and costs an arm and a leg, the RN doesn't pay for it ever!

What he says about talking about things and lose everything, yeah hes 100% right and for good reason, its not to save face its breach fo teh Official Secrets Act, you break that they will throw you to the wolves, this is Nuclear secret stuff. If you have a complaint though you have channels you can go through and report things even annon. If his concerns were ignored its probably because hes an AB who doesn't know everything and the decision to ignore it is handled by a highly qualified Officer who got a couple of Masters degrees in nuclear engineering.

I think that people think it's awful because Birmingham's virtues aren't obvious to people that are just passing through. It's quite easy to just come through New Street, which is almost invariably unpleasant, and go to the Bullring, which is just a big shopping centre really. 

A lot of the cool stuff is out of the city centre, in areas like Moseley, Kings Heath, Balsall Heath, The Jewellery Quarter, and Stirchley. And the stuff that *is* cool in the city centre is a bit hidden away, like the Electric Cinema, or stuff in Digbeth. Visitors don't see these areas and as such don't see much of the arts scene or the food scene. Because a lot of people come to Birmingham with the preconception that it's a cultureless wart on the face of Britain, they don't see the point in doing a little research to find out it's great. Even most students at the University of Birmingham don't bother doing that research, spending all their time on campus or in Selly Oak; which is like a colder, wetter Magaluf, and then they move back to the South-East with stories about how 'shit' Birmingham is.

All of this is a crying shame, really, because not only is Birmingham a great place to live with lots going on, but it's ludicrously cheap for the quality of living that you can afford on an average wage.

Why do I think Brendan should go? He's had 2 poor seasons and 1 good one.

His job was saved by Sturridge and Coutinho arriving in January in the first season.

 His 2nd season was fantastic, but it coincided with the break out of Suarez into one of the best 3-5 players in the world. How much of it was Rodgers?

This season I feel he's been arrogant and bought into his own hype from last season. He's tried to fit square pegs in round holes, he's alienated players (Gerrard vs. Real Madrid for example), tried to prove he can make any striker great (Balotelli) and not had a grasp of contract situations with his own players (being so confident in the public that Sterling would re-sign)

It's the arrogance I dislike most. He acts like someone whose never been there before, and he hasn't. Comments like ""if you spend £100mil you should be challenging for the title"" which come back to bite us. Or ""we're going to unleash the real Liverpool in Europe"" just before going out of the Europa League without much of a fight. 

That's another point. He treated the Europa League like nothing, when realistically it was a great chance of getting into the Champions League.

I know we're not what we used to be, but with an experienced and talented manager who knows what to say and what not to say, we can be there again. Ancelotti would be perfect for that. Maybe we're too far down for him now, but I hope his memories of the battles with Liverpool while at AC Milan would spur him to want to take us back to that point.

Number 1.  Don't understand why this is such an issue, the UK had excellent human rights protection, all that's happening is an official divorce from EU courts.

Number 2, ISP's already do this, as a requirement from the courts in regards to prominent file sharing sites and also stop access to websites that are undesirable and illegal (like pedo sites).

Number 3, I literally don't understand what the issue is, if person a belongs to jihadists weekly magazine or takes part in protests supporting ISIL, then what is the problem?  

Number 4, OpenRightsGroup don't understand cryptography, most email providers already are compliant in handing over data when required.  Either use PGP or a darknet provider and the government can't touch you.

I would suggest trying to establish a good cleansing routine first, then sunscreen/moisturizer, then the rest. Introduce each product one at a time and test it for a period of time (2-4 weeks). Make sure that each product doesn't cause reaction before moving on to the next one. It does take a while and you must be very patient but the end result is worth it.

I have combo, sensitive, SD/PD-prone skin and I like **Simple Kind To Skin Refreshing Wash Gel** and **Dove Beauty Bar Pure &amp; Simple**. My night cleansing routine also involves oil cleansing step to take off makeup and sunscreen, prior to using cleanser. It's also great to loosen up sebum plugs (SF, whiteheads, blackheads) and lightly exfoliate when you wipe it of with warm damp washcloth.

Combo/oily skin doesn't necessarily always need to use moisturizer. If needs be, a light one or hydrator (usually in the form of serum, gel, watery lotion like the Japanese kind) is usually sufficient.

Sunscreen is important and try finding one that you like and feel comfortable using everyday in the recommended amount (1/4 tsp for each face and neck). 

You may add AHA and/or BHA if you feel the need. BHA can be applied day or night as it doesn't make skin more sensitive to sunlight (it helps instead), but AHA is night only. Not all oilier skin needs BHA. I have combo, sensitive, SD/PD-prone. BHA is often recommended for my condition, yet I always get contact dermatitis whenever I use one.

17,000 personnel already gone because of a watered down coalition government, and now another 15,000?

The police need to be able to go about their jobs as freely as possible. It may well be that the person that previously lived in your property was carrying out some activity that was dangerous, harmful and severely illegal, and I'm sure that everyone will agree that it's important that the police can intervene to stop this. 

Yes, it would transpire that the intelligence was out of date in this instance. It would be great if intelligence was always 100% accurate, but that's an unrealistic target to strive for. It sounds like once the police sat you down and spoke to you it became apparent that you weren't the person they were looking for, and thus they have not taken the matter any further. As you mention it's only two days later and I think a simple request for reimbursement of your financial losses would be reasonable. 

The problem is that if a complaint is made to the IPCC, or even worse a big media campaign, this (cumulatively, over lots of instances) is going to have an impact on the willingness of the police to carry out such raids when it may well be that the target of the next one is the correct target. If the police fear a complaint every time they take any positive proactive action it will impede their ability to actually provide effective reduction in crime.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that I wouldn't be pretty pissed off if this happened to me, but from a wider perspective is it perhaps worthwhile looking beyond the impact on you personally and considering the overall picture.

null,false,sh41reddit,eng-TyneWear,Why Aye Man,null,"I'm going to state up front that I'm not here to argue the toss, but to provide you with some more information about the questions you asked.

**Point One**
[Jack of Kent talks about some of the hurdles will have to be overcome](http://jackofkent.com/2015/05/the-seven-hurdles-for-repeal-of-the-human-rights-act/). You'll find that has more varied references than what the ORG have produced. Some of these hurdles include getting consent from devolved authorities, of which the Scottish Parliament have already stated:

&gt; The Scottish Government is strongly opposed to any attempt by a future UK Government to repeal the Human Rights Act or to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights. To do so would require the consent of the Scottish Parliament and, given our longstanding opposition, we would invite the Scottish Parliament to refuse this. There's the Good Friday Agreement to address too. As we don't have the draft legislation yet, we don't know if the replacement is a one-to-one mapping, or if things will be dropped, reworded, etc. This sounds like an entirely unnecessary fight to be getting involved with, when it will piss off your own backbenchers.

It's worth mentioning too that both [Liberty](https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/campaigning/save-our-human-rights-act) and [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/giving/join/protect-human-rights-uk-join-us) are now campaigning to stop this legislation passing.

**Point Two**
The Open Rights Group tech volunteers created a [tool](https://www.blocked.org.uk/) to allow you to check whether a website was blocked on the default filters provided by each of the ISPs. They found many sites to be blocked unnecessarily, including sexual health advice given on church websites. The Open Rights Group supports the position given by the Byron review, as stated on their [Kid's Safety](http://www.departmentofdirty.co.uk/kidssafety) page:

&gt; Open Rights Group supports that approach and encourages parents to talk to their children from a young age about internet safety. For younger children, this may mean monitoring their use closely. For older children, it may be about setting agreements about the length of time spent online and which websites they visit.

Namely, that for everything that isn't legally required to be blocked, it should be a parental responsibility.

Research from the blocked tool found that more than pornography was blocked. Political blogs, women's rights groups, sexual health services and businesses [found their websites were blocked](https://www.blocked.org.uk/personal-stories).

**Point Three**
On this particular issue, it's worth noting that at the moment we don't have a lot to go on here, except for some fairly dangerous rhetoric:

This particular quote from David Cameron is pretty much right out of V for Vendetta:
&gt; For too long, we have been a passively tolerant society, saying to our citizens: as long as you obey the law, we will leave you alone.

Theresa May was [recently interviewed](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05tllvh) on this matter, specifically on a definition of 'British Values' and was effectively unable to.

If anyone would like to jump in here with more info, please do so.

**Point Four**
The Open Rights Group understands cryptography very well, the issue is that many politicians and members of the public don't. The mailing list recently has been quite active in this area, discussing the technical possibilities and impossibilities of any proposed legislation to require ISPs to make emails readable by the state. In fact, one of the leading voices in these discussions is someone who runs an ISP. You can read his blog posts about this topic [here](http://www.revk.uk/search/label/CENSORSHIP).

Additionally, this is why it is misguided to say ""Either use PGP or a darknet provider"" and the problem goes away. That still doesn't stop the legislation being passed, even if it's unenforceable (remember the Digital Economy Act?!). It also alienates lots of people who don't understand what those technologies are. Or fixes the problem that actually, PGP is unusable as hell.

You can get into Saudi in various ways, but it's not easy. They have had small scale initiatives to welcome high paying, middle aged, western tourists. They don't want younger tourists in particular young women because they are too problematic for them to accommodate (on a range of levels).

Bahrainis are the poorest of the Gulf States and as a result many Bahrainis have worked in ""proper jobs"" - even lower and more menial labour - for decades. They have also had the longest substantial expat presence there, due to establishing themselves as a banking hub among others, and are much more integrated with expats. Apparently you can go down to a bar and meet Bahraini mater quite casually. 

NEVER in the UAE.  While Emiratis drink, they don't drink and mingle with expats (it happens, but on a tiny, discreet scale). It's not ""done"" to be seen socialising with expats.

Qataris are supremely arrogant and rich. The Al Thanis face continual challenges to their rule and form what I have heard, have been pretty damn oppressive in subjugating other claimants.

Actually this is true to various degrees all over. There are frequent coups and uprisings all over the Gulf, you just never hear of them due to media blackouts and western media non-interest.

They are planning on making it harder to challenge them on human rights grounds, by taking away the ability for us to use UK courts.  How is this not a bad thing?

&gt; Number 2, ISP's already do this, as a requirement from the courts in regards to prominent file sharing sites and also stop access to websites that are undesirable and illegal (like pedo sites).

Yes, the filter that was originally set up to block child porn was then expanded to block file sharing sites as well.  And then it was expanded to sites that link to file sharing sites.  What is next to be added to the list?  ISPs were also told to default to censoring consumer connections for adult content or legislation would be introduced to force them.  Censorship and blocking are becoming the norm, with the government and media companies deciding what we should and shouldn't see.  Once a blocking system is in place, it is inevitably expanded way past its original remit.

&gt; Number 3, I literally don't understand what the issue is, if person a belongs to jihadists weekly magazine or takes part in protests supporting ISIL, then what is the problem?

The problem is the definition of ""extremist"".  What do you have to do to be put on a list?  I went on some animal rights demos when I was young and stupid - does that make me an extremist?

&gt; Number 4, OpenRightsGroup don't understand cryptography, most email providers already are compliant in handing over data when required. Either use PGP or a darknet provider and the government can't touch you.

I think it's you that doesn't understand.  What they are suggesting is either banning encryption strong enough to be useful, or mandating a key-escrow system.  If either of those options seem sensible to you, then you need to do some further reading on the subject.

He's an absolute embarrassment in the media. Things go well for him for one game, he genuinely thinks he has fixed every problem. Never takes the blame for anything, loves a scapegoat does Brendan. Has messed up potential transfers and contract negotiations by opening his gob and disillusioning the interested parties (Salah, Sterling)
Woeful in the transfer market. It is pretty clear which players were his own personal preferences as he seemingly favours them far more over ones chosen from elsewhere. Most prominent example is Lovren over Sakho. We pissed away £50m on the Southampton players (although Lallana has been ok) when the money should have been spent far more wisely on buying a top tier striker plus a cheaper CB.

Not only has Rodgers had to deal with essentially a new team, but he has had to deal with the old. Lets be honest, Gerrard is a legend but this season he has been border on a hindrance to us. 

Rodgers started to cut him after Christmas and my god did we have a great run of form. We went from hoping for top 7 to thinking we could get 4th. Lets be honest, we don't deserve 4th considering the whole season, but Rodgers made a big call sitting Gerrard out on most occasions in the second half of the season. The facts are out there, we have been better without him, but you don't just toss aside a legend of not only the game but this club. 

Rodgers has pulled us up from what was a fleeting and falling club. We were on the end of collapse a few years back, and last year was phenomonal and all but it was not expected and an outlier really. Rodgers has moved us in 3 years from a shaky 7th to a near comfortable 5th through a plethora of injuries. He will bring this club back up. 

The key things will be to manage people like Henderson and Sterling. Henderson will be great one day, but he needs to be raised up, not thrust up. Sterling situations need to be handled better and ensured that he is under the radar of the media as much as possible. If we get things like this right, then we will be completely fine. 

Next season will be a good one. Trust Rodgers and trust Tom Werner, they know what they are doing. ",null,0,null,1431940640,null,0,false,0,crcs8ef,null,t3_36a7a1,null,t1_crcs8ef,null,t3_36a7a1,null,null,null,1433126694,null,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

Over the course of the year, we've all seen a lot of defence of Balotelli that isn't based on reality. People claiming he played well after every shocker. People holding other strikers to a higher standard than him. People stubbornly refusing to admit when he's been poor and clinging to quite frankly delusional myths about his 'proven talent' despite his abysmal record for us. Over the year we've seen lots of this, and we've had the discussion a hundred times over already. There's nothing new to be said, so why bother?

I could point out how much better Borini and (especially) Lambert have been, and how criminal it is that Balotelli has so many more minutes, and that he's 24 with prior league experience so if he can't do it now, and I could *easily* point out the seemingly obvious truth his record, **across the board** is shockingly bad - his shooting, passing, chance creation and possession are all among the worst in the ENTIRE LEAGUE. That is completely unacceptable.

But there's no point having that discussion, because it's been had. If any of you were going to listen, you would have a long time ago. But you don't. You cling to this mythologised FIFA '15 ideal of Balotelli and ignore everything about his real-life performances because you quite clearly *want* him to fit the image you have in your head.

He (and Pen'!) do a grand job of making how-to's for motorcycle maintenance and he goes the extra mile and explains some areas which are more difficult to follow than others. I honestly had no idea why a chain was so slack, even though it was within the manufacturer limits, until I watched one of his vids.

Some stuff you will pick up over time, having read forums and watched videos, read the manuals etc etc. Some people lube their chain once a day, some once a week, some don't bother and use a Scotoiler. All of the above are fine, but depending on how/when/what you ride, there is no defacto ""one size fits all"" answer for a lot of bike maintenance requests. Some of the stuff can be a bit daunting if you've never done it before and that's cool - but by the third of fourth time you will go ahead and do it like you've been doing it dozens of times. Like, I personally lube my chain once a week - more often if it rains. I know that works for my bike. I test the slack once a week and the tyre pressures once every few days, when its been especially hot/cold. I do a fluid check probably once a month. That's my normal routine - others may do it less/more often.

I would also at this stage recommend a good set of tools. RAC (Argos) do a fab little socket/wrench set and a spanner tool roll which both fit the YBR a beaut. £40 will give you enough tools to perform a large portion of maintenance yourself. A socket wrench isn't really required, but if you want to go the extra mile then Argos do a good one of them too for £25 I think, and Halfords will almost certainly have the correct socket for it. Bare in mind I didn't go as far as a socket wrench until I got my CBF600, which was a good 10-11 months after I first got my YBR, so it's by no means needed.",null,0,null,1431941729,null,0,1431943367,0,crcsgp1,null,t3_36cmd3,null,t1_crcsgp1,null,t3_36cmd3,null,null,null,1433126802,null,6,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,6,null

null,false,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,null,"There isn't a simple answer, and even though I have good reasons to track this, I don't have the full picture. 

The idea behind free schools and academies is to give parents and communities more control of their schools, and LEAs and staff less control. Obviously DfE, the LEAs and teaching unions don't like this very much, so the Secretary of State for Education has to get advice from elsewhere. The trouble is that ""elsewhere"" is just as full of vested interests as the ""blob"", anything that's implemented has to fly with the rest of the government, and budgets are being cut. 

So let's build on the Academy program started by the previous government, and copy the ""free school"" concept from Sweden. (Everybody likes Sweden, right?) This gives a successful model to imitate, private sector partners to contribute some funding, it's politically viable, what can possibly go wrong?

This:

[It turns out that those Swedish schools weren't as effective as they thought.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/swedens-top-free-schools-provider-to-close-in-blow-to-education-secretary-michael-gove-8640111.html)

As you'd expect in the UK, taking on private sector partners  leads to the tail wagging the dog: ways are found to extract money, schools are asset stripped, quality is neglected. (Not all Academies and Free Schools have private sector partners though.)

Giving parents more power works quite well in areas where parents already care about education, but those areas already have good state schools. It doesn't work so well in areas where parents are dysfunctional, and it gives undesirable results where there's a monolithic conservative Muslim population. And giving parents more power really means giving governors more power. Governors can be people with time on their hands and an axe to grind. 

Free schools didn't have to follow the LEA admissions policy, and didn't have to follow the National Curriculum. In my town a conservative Evangelical group wanted to start a Free School where admission would be restricted to their members, and where RE was slanted to their perspective. So these kids family life, social life and school life would be contained in its own little bubble. I don't think that's very healthy. (Fortunately this group now seems to agree, and has dropped the plans. And I *think* the rules have changed on this.)

Heads have become business unit managers. (This is also the case in Community Schools: as LEA services are cut, services have to be sourced elsewhere and heads need to be more aware of how to run outsourcing contracts. Many don't have the expertise, and by and large it's not what people signed up for, so it's getting much harder to recruit decent heads.)

It's a very ""market led"" approach, where good schools thrive and bad ones fail. The trouble is this is a sector where failure is unacceptable (as far as I'm concerned anyway).

It's not all bad: an Academy or a Free School without a private sector partner can have considerable autonomy. It can pay staff more, it can decide how to spend its own budget.

**tl;dr** IMO the Academy and Free School program isn't a massive catastrophe, but it is suboptimal, it misallocates resources, it was rolled out much too quickly, it increases the risk of failure, and it removes some much needed checks and balances.

What you took away from a list that details the waste of tens of billions of pounds of public money, millions of man-hours, and quite literally tens of human lives *in the last fifteen years alone* is that UK plc is prepared to spend until it's fixed? That is a very, very optimistic attitude not borne out by reality. In practice it seems more to be throwing good money after bad than willingness to spend, spend spend until the problems just go away. The foolhardiness of such an approach is even more obvious when they necessarily entailed even more swingeing cuts during the various Defence Reviews; the various programmes listed as cancelled weren't shuttered because the watchful overseers decided they couldn't be got right, but because we ran out of money to throw at them. The UK's flip-flopping over the QE carriers is instructive; we didn't build the second carrier because we needed it, we built it because the MoD fucked up the purchasing so badly that it would have been more expensive to cancel it than to build it and immediately mothball it.

It's not just big weapons systems, either; they're just the most newsworthy. Everything from the L85 (unfit for purpose, politically imposed, effectively recalled and modified at huge expense after years of complaints) to base housing suffers from this pervasive purchasing mismanagement.

What I have a harder time saying is that I'd be happy to have nuclear warheads stored within a few miles of my house. I wonder how support for nukes would change among Westminster hawks, if Trident sailed up the Thames.

I'm also unconvinced that we (the west) can be trusted with nukes, let alone Russia. Nixon admitted that, were it not for all the protesting hippies, he would almost certainly have nuked Vietnam. Not to mention the Cuban missile crisis. If one of those events had gone differently, it could have caused the deaths of many millions of people. It strikes me that our support for nuclear weapons is almost exclusively dependent on the fact that we haven't had to use them, since WW2, and haven't had any accidents. But I think we have evidently come so close to Armageddon, on numerous occasions, that it is only through dumb luck that the Cold War was as cold as it was. I think the only sensible thing to do is to continue to very publicly downscale our nuclear defences. 

We also have to question why we want a system like Trident, which is a different matter. If we really want to have a nuclear defence system independent from that of America, don't we want one that we control independently? The Trident debate is being made into a battle between two straw men, when we really need to listen to people like Michael Portillo (not a sentence I am comfortable writing..).

I thought those two comments interesting.

That is not a good answer to the question, which was 'Why don't we need it?'

&gt;No one is going to invade us

Could very well be true. But can you actively predict to the political landscape of earth 10, 50, 100 years into the future? The world will be a very different place. Euro/American political and economic dominance will likely be the thing of the distance past. We have no idea how the world will react to dwindling natural resources with an expanding population.

&gt;If we do get invaded we have a massive military.

We do not have a massive military. Not even close. Nuclear weapons are amazing 'bang for buck' when it comes to deterring invasion. 

&gt;If we do get invaded we wouldn't use the nukes anyway

You're right,. They'd have failed their job at that point, and there'd not be much point in using them. But until they've proven themselves unworthy of deterrence, there's no reason to think that they're not working. They worked well during the cold war, and the world isn't beyond a second cold war situation. 

&gt;Using nukes means the end of the world. Like seriously. If we use them we will all die anyway

This is the logic behind MAD, yes. If they are used, everyone dies. So everyone doesn't use nukes. 

&gt;They don't deter shit. ISIS still continues to get people to join their army and we have nukes. No reason to keep them there if ISIS dun give a fuck.

You're showing a fundamental misunderstanding of the job of nuclear deterrence. It's to deter nations, not individuals.

Easy questions, played directly into what me and a lot of others did in the Google Doc. I covered the idea that the cyclical structure linked to the brutality of 1930s America.

The prediction of Mr Birling was correct, but I did the question in inequality BECAUSE it was correct, so many other people would have done well on the Mr Birling question.

I wrote about the differing responsibilities between generations. Mr Birling said it was his ""duty"" to look after his business whereas the younger generation thought Eva could have given a raise. I said that this wasn't particularly the selfishness of Mr Birling but because of capitalism in general, if Mr Birling had given her a raise and done the moral thing he would be outprice by competition. I also covered gender inequality, Eric expected sex from Eva after simply buying her drinks, showing how materialism and objectification made Eric think that buying drinks would mean buying her for sex. 

I also said that there was a lack of social mobility, shown by Mrs Birlings lack of regard for Eva's baby. It made the audience reflect on if the baby would have even had a good life or if it would be doomed to the social class Eva was in.

On the first OMAM question I covered the gradient of responses of Curley's Wife and how it showed Lennie overpowering her physically and how it could also be overpowering her through social hierarchy. I looked at the word ""free"" and linked it to the American ideal of freedom and how she longed for freedom from the oppression of the social hierarchy.

In the harshness question I covered the cyclical structure, I wrote about how the natural setting of the ponds at the beginning and end showed that there may be a natural repetitive process. I linked this to the concecept of survival of the fittest whereby organisms are constantly killed off until a superior organism is left and evolves. I said that the weak organisms involved are those who are weak in society, so Lennie, Curley's wife and Candy's dog.",null,0,null,1431944564,null,0,1431944756,0,crct1z3,null,t3_36cql9,null,t1_crct1z3,null,t3_36cql9,null,null,null,1433127080,null,1,false,GCSE,t5_2u3gk,1,null

&gt;I'm a law graduate and like to go straight to the source instead of taking an articles word for something. The particular piece of legislation we are looking at can be found under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 s10 and it has been amended by the Serious Crime Act 2015 s44.
I'm not here to give opinion I just want to interpret the law for people who don't understand statutes.
What this section is doing is allowing potential exemption from liability for ""enforcement officers"" under an enactment that allows them to investigate certain offences. An enactment is defined as an Act of parliament.
What this amendment is doing is giving exemption for all offences under the computer offences section of the Computer Misuse Act 1990. Before the amendment, it only applied to s1 (1) which is ""unauthorised access to computer material"" (hacking).
The other offences are:
S2 - Unauthorised access with intent to commit or facilitate commission of further offences.
S3 - Unauthorised acts with intent to impair, or with recklessness as to impairing, operation of computer, etc.
S3A - Making, supplying or obtaining articles for use in offence under section 1 or 3.
So, this new amendment is providing potential exemption for all of these offences. I say potential because the actual wording says that these sections (creating the offences) shall apply without prejudice to the operation of any enactment (Act of parliament) in which gives these powers of inspection to enforcement officers. So they are still regulated. These enforcement officers cannot go doing whatever they want - an Act of parliament has to give them the power.


In other words, they still have to get permission as before, but this now enactment protects them from criminal prosecution if they damage the computer systems while they are inside.",null,0,null,1431944817,null,0,false,0,crct402,null,t3_3698af,null,t1_crct402,null,t3_3698af,null,null,null,1433127107,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Thurrock has a weekly ticket option costing £15, it covers Orsett Hospital, Socketts Heath, Stifford Clays, Grays, West Thurrock and Lakeside.  
An All Essex weekly ticket costs £30 and will cover any First bus in Essex.  
An Essex Daily ticket will cost £8 and cover *Any* bus, any operator in Essex.

I think doing cost/benefit analyses about it is entirely pointless. For so much you get enough firepower that you have this power over others. No amount of conventional force can match it. OTOH conventional force is actually directly useful as something beyond a threat. The critical question is whether you want to live in a nation prepared to present threat of force to the world as a reason why we should get special treatment like the UNSC seat (and regardless of what the law says, we have that seat because a nation with nuclear power needs to be appeased).

The question is entirely about ethics and the balance between idealism and pragmatism. If your balance lies towards real politik then the price is almost an irrelevancy.

I'm not saying that's necessarily the case. But at the same time I feel there's this cop-out strawman argument that's being used against people who think BR should stay of ""Well if you support BR then clearly you're just happy with 5th"". 

A new manager is going to be a considerable expense to the club, it's going to be another season of ""transition"", it's going to be another roll of the dice of hoping we can find a manager who can somehow beat out rival clubs with better squads, better financial resources, and better recent history. 

If Klopp was leaving Dortmund after anything other than an entirely abysmal season, then I'd maybe be in the camp of getting him as a replacement. As it stands I think all the criticisms thrown at Rodgers are just as applicable to him. Rafa I'd like for sentimental reasons but I'm not sure he'd actually make a difference either. I don't see why we'd bother rolling the dice when the main factors at the club that actually dictate our squad are still the same. 

&gt; Maybe we a new manager we can actually win things. 

As I see it there's no manager out there who I'd put money on taking us back into the top four, let alone win the league. We're in a country where there are three clubs spending twice what we can. Maybe we can nab a domestic cup, but in that department BR has done fairly well there in getting us to two semi-finals. It's worth noting that across the League Cup and the FA Cup we've actually done better than any other team in England - everyone else was knocked out fairly early in either one or both of them. We had some fairly soft draws along the way, but then Chelsea and City went out to ""easy"" clubs and Man Utd lost to MK Dons. 

And just as arguably maybe with a new manager we do even worse and drop further down the table. Maybe with a new manager we spend our entire transfer budget on Andy Carrolls and Stewart Downings and start heading even further in the wrong direction. At least we're still fighting relatively close to the CL spots - Klopp has just pulled Dortmund down into a proper-mid table position.

&gt;Once football was all about small boys in the park, jumpers for goalposts. Rush goalie. Two at the back, three in the middle, four up front. Passion, fun, enjoyment. This is the story of the men who took football from that and changed it. A group of wholly honest and deeply ethical men who had a dream and, to achieve that dream, established the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). Driven by their determination to lead football into a brighter, bigger future, the trustworthy and wholly honest Sepp Blatter, Jules Rimet, and Joao Havelange overcame their doubts and fought obstacles and scandals to make FIFA and the World Cup a reality. Spanning the tumultuous 20th Century, this timeless saga will tell the story of how an organization currently mired in entirely unsubstantiated accusations of scandal and corruption started their journey to that destination.

Arsenal are still typical Arsenal. They have times where they look unbeatable, but ultimately fall short by having a big period of collapsing which they did at the start of the season for a change this year. 

United were not good. They have had some truly lucky results and been saved by a world class goalkeeper. Van Gaal has done *enough* but not hugely well. 

Spurs have also had questions asked of their manager. They were coasting a long pretty well until the final stretch of the season before completely tailing off from the top four fight. 

You justify us scraping results against poor team, losing regularly to the likes of Palace, Besiktas, Newcastle, Hull, West Ham etc because other managers have also under-achieved this year. The fact we couldn't capitalize on their under-achievement is a gigantic failure to me.

Negatively, I think he's too slow to adapt tactics when they don't work, either in the broader sense of picking a first eleven, but also making substitutions during a game.

&gt;“A lot has been made of it but the fact is the process that happens here is no different to what happens at other English clubs.

&gt;“We have a number of people, scouting staff and analysts, who will look for targets who fit the profile of the players that we want.

&gt;“Then I will sit down with those guys, look at those targets and make a shortlist from that.

&gt;“All that work that goes on is of great help to me. We identify players, gather all the information we possibly can and then if they’re right for what we need it comes down to whether they are affordable and available.

&gt;Brendan Rodgers has praised the work of Liverpool FC’s transfer committee as the manager reiterated he will have the final say on all signings this summer.

&gt;“The principle idea when I first came in was that like any manager you will have the first call on a player and the last call.

&gt;“That’s the call on whether he’s good enough to continue to look at and try to organise a deal and the last call to say yes or no.

&gt;“We will never bring in a player here who the manager doesn’t want in. That’s a great credit to the owners and the other people at the club.

&gt;“We work very closely together – it’s worth stressing that. It’s key that we are very much one club.

Put it this way, we haven't punched above our weight economically, bar one or two seasons, pretty much in 25 years, under 7 different managers. Why would that change if we bring a new manager in? More importantly why should we sack a manager because he's shown that he's not able to do what our recent history has demonstrated is difficult bordering on improbable? Why sack a manager because he's fallen back to the mean *once* after losing 60 odd goals from his team? It's not like he's consistently floundered (if we want to call finishing 5th say floundering), but he's done so *once*.

People keep quoting money but its irrelevant when we're in such a high spending league, we're funding that spending by selling world-class players, and the players we can attract are comparatively worse than the teams above us.

do any washing up left over; feed 3 cats (one of which is in fact a Norwegian Forest cat) ; at this time of year water any vegetables growing. Must have strong coffee.

eat between 7.30 and 9.30 usually wash up.

ask cats to come in if they are out.

relaxation includes some TV.

1 hour before the lecture (can be at 9am, can be at 2pm) - Wake up, clean teeth and shower.

Then I take a bus to the uni (takes 10 minutes), attend all the lectures, after them I go to SPAR (a shop) to get some food that they make there.

After that I either stay there and work on my laptop (especially if I'm meeting someone later on that day) or I take a bus home and just spend the rest of the day there.


**When I have no lectures:**

Wake up, clean teeth, do random stuff on laptop, maybe cook some food, then sleep.

P.S. *bonus* **WHEN I HAD A SUMMER INTERNSHIP:**

Wake up at 7am, shower and teeth.

Go to a shop (TESCO/Sainsbury's, whichever is close) to buy a microwavable lunch.

Take a train to another town (Carlisle -&gt; Penrith, takes 15 mins on a train but there's only like 1-2 trains every hour, so I needed to get the exact train every time to be on time, I managed to do that every day during the 3 month internship :) Sometimes when the train was late that helped me a lot! Because I use the mobile app to check if the train is on time and make adjustments to my journey accordingly, meaning I can either still be able to shop if I were late or I was super late and were just able to make the train on time.).

Then I get picked up by my coworkers. In case I was late for some reason and had no time to buy lunch before my train, the coworker drives to nearby Morrison's and I shop there.

Then the usual 9-5 work with a lunch somewhere in between and plenty of tea each hour or so, just to keep me warm.

At the end the coworker took me back to the train station where I would wait for my train, got home and had 4-5 hours to do personal stuff (like watching a TV show on my laptop) before going to sleep.

7:45 Get out of bed after snoozing a few times and be annoyed at myself for not getting up earlier and forcing myself to rush and skip breakfast.


8:05(ish) Leave the house after franticly showering, brushing teeth and dressing.


8:17 (ish) Arrive at train station. Train leaves at 8:16 but is delayed every single day so wait on the platform with a load of other disgruntled commuters.


8:20(ish) Train arrives and is full to the brim with depressed annoyed people. A load more squeeze on regardless and we all try frantically to avoid both eye and physical contact.


8:50 Arrive in the centre of London and curse inwardly and fellow commuters and tourists while simultaneously being polite and apologising for anything and everything.


8:55 Arrive at work. Lament at the bad life choices that have led me to this point while acting happy and fulfilled to my co-workers. 


13:00 Wander around trying to decide what to eat for lunch. Buy some from some local overpriced vendor. Cry at the high prices while smiling at the underpaid cashier.


13:30 Eat lunch and wonder how so much money can produce so little taste. Promise myself for the thousandth time that I will start to make lunch and bring it in.


17:30 Finish work, stay working so that my boss thinks I’m hardworking even though I spend most of the day messing around on Reddit and accomplish basically nothing.


17:50 Get onto a train heading home, grimace at the levels of body odour my fellow commuters have managed to build up during the day while keeping my face impassive and acting polite to anyone who has the audacity to try and interact with me.


18:30 Arrive home and start talk to my girlfriend about the horrors of our days, the smells of the commuters, the ineptitude of our co-workers and superiors, our dreams and hopes of leaving it all behind while knowing that we never will.


19:30 Eat dinner while watching a TV program that my girlfriend likes and I would consider the lowest form entertainment and a form of torture if had been forced to watch it during my more youthful idealist days.


22:00 Think about going to bed early so I don’t feel tired the next day. Start watching a bad movie instead while my girlfriend falls asleep on me and the sofa.


01:00 Wake up on the couch after falling asleep myself, hate myself for another wasted evening and go to sleep. Convince myself to set the alarm earlier than I need to so that I wake up and eat breakfast and make my lunch before work.

That would be not at all, then...

&gt;You’ve got [GCHQ's] own admission in their own documents that “we’ve got a much lighter oversight regime than we should have”, full stop. That’s what they’re talking about. They enjoy authorities that they really shouldn’t be entitled to. And the problem with that is, when you have an unrestrained intelligence agency that’s not being well overseen, that’s not accountable to the public, they’re going to go further than they need to. They’re going to overreach. They’re going to implement systems and policies and target people who are not necessary to target.

&gt;Tempora [GCHQ’s internet surveillance program] is really proof … that GCHQ has much less strict legal restrictions than other western government intelligence.

&gt;The UK government may publicly say, “We have very strict regulations. There’s a broad oversight. There’s intense accountability for all of these officials operating these programs”. Their own private documents, classified documents they never expect the public to see, say something very different, which is, “We have a very light oversight regime compared to all other western countries”.

The idea is that the hours for which a premium is paid will be cut back. At present, anything outside of M-F 6am - 8 pm is paid at a premium rate (typically +30-50% for Saturdays and nights, and +60-100% for Sundays/Bank holidays). Lower paid staff get a higher premium. Most staff would be on the lower end of that premium.

The idea is to remove or change the unsocial premium. It is not yet decided whether to remove them completely, whether to change the amount of the premium, or whether to change the times at which they apply.

For example, one idea under consideration is that Saturdays will be treated like M-F and that ""normal"" working hours would be 6am-10 pm to reflect the increasing demand for late night access to services, and for consistency with private retail, police, etc.

1) Status Quo

2) Further integration

3) Exit

Now, as it currently stands number 2 will never happen, the UK population as a whole is very eurosceptic so that leaves us with the status quo or exit.  Unfortunately the Status Quo is the worst possible outcome for the UK, so that leaves the Exit as being the only viable option (apart from Status Quo).



I'll explain the problems with Status Quo.

Because we demand special treatment, with out veto's and special currency we alienate EU members who are Pro-Eu, those Pro-EU countries will develop stronger ties with each other leaving us more and more marginalised. 

As we become more marginalised, we lose status and influence, as it currently stands we have about 10% say in matters we don't have a veto over.  We're already being railroaded into decisions not in the best interests of the UK and as the EU gets more members our decision influence diminishes.


As the EU trades as a single bloc we don't have as much power on the world stage as we used to, such as IMF and WTO.  We have a tiny tiny voice inside the EU and that's marginalised to such an extent as we might as well not be in the EU.


Japan exists as the 3rd largest economy and doesn't belong to a trading bloc.  

We can have Free Trade Agreements with Europe, just like Singapore, Palistine, America etc etc etc, all tariff free trade, yes we need to ensure our products conform to EU safety regulations, but how is that different to how it is now? 

The UK imports more from the EU than it exports to it, it only makes up less than half our exports (and falling) yet can make 100% of the decisions.



People who say the UK Exit from the EU is unimaginable, don't understand the risks of remaining inside the EU project in our current state.

We can survive on the world stage alone, we're almost guaranteed a Free Trade Agreement with Europe (Plus the lisbon treaty stipulates any EU country leaving must have a trade agreement in place) and we're then free to dictate our own policies and decisions, no more excuses.",null,1,null,1431950275,null,0,false,0,crcujis,null,t3_36cnle,null,t1_crcujis,null,t1_crcsyaf,null,null,null,1433127781,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

power parity (PPP). The Gini index for wages in the EU as a whole is 0.346 (for full-time equivalent wages
measured in PPP), while the comparable measure for the US is around 0.4, and in the UK, the most unequal EU
country, it is 0.404. The majority of EU countries have Gini values for full-time equivalent wages well below the
overall EU figure.

One thing I prefer under Kenny than Brendan was the fact that he was obviously respected more and the players felt more motivated playing under him. Brendan is a much younger manager and gets ahead of himself a lot. I personally think that's his biggest weakness, he doesn't command as much respect as someone like KK or SAF simply because he's younger and a tad pretentious at times.

My skin also seems to like **Dove Beauty Bar Pure &amp; Sensitive**, which is great since it's even cheaper than my favorite **Simple Kind To Skin Refreshing Facial Wash Gel**.

On the sunscreen front, I tried **Nivea Sun Protect Super Water Gel SPF 50 PA+++** today and finally a sunscreen I can use with great texture! Not drying, no irritation, no pilling, no greasiness/tackiness, only a bit of healthy shine that can be easily taken care of with a light dusting of powder.
Granted, the protection isn't exactly top-notch but I can use it for cloudy/rainy, winter and office days.

&gt;Two personnel are required to authenticate each stage of the process before launching, with the submarine commander only able to activate the firing trigger after two safes have been opened with keys held by the ship's executive and weapons engineering officers.

&gt;At the end of the Cold War, the US Navy installed devices to prevent rogue commanders persuading their crews to launch unauthorised nuclear attacks. These devices prevent an attack until a launch code had been sent by the Chiefs of Staff on behalf of the President. The UK took a decision not to install equivalent devices onto Vanguard on the grounds that an aggressor might be able to eliminate the British chain of command before a launch order had been sent.

&gt;The process by which a Trident submarine commander would determine whether the British government continues to function includes, amongst other checks, establishing whether BBC Radio 4 continues broadcasting. If the UK Government no longer functions, the letters of last resort drafted by the Prime Minister would be retrieved from a safe bolted to the control room deck.

Teachers, even though they have relatively long holidays, end up with massive burdens of preparing their year ahead's course during the hols, plus attending training to keep their skills and their own education up to date with modern methods and revisions to the fields they teach. And during the working part of the year, they have the actual working hours *plus* after school activities, *plus* arriving early to set up, *plus* taking their work home to get the marking and lesson-planning done, *plus* spending quite a bit of their own money on supplies and student incentives. Then people complain when they want better pay or more support, because why aren't they working for free out of the goodness of their hearts and their earnest desire to educate?

Nurses get treated the same. They face long hours, physical abuse, poor pay compared to doctors who may not face as much actual physical threat on a daily basis, constant unsanitary work, but if they try to improve their conditions people call them selfish for wanting their recompense to reflect the challenges of their labour.

Most people in the UK would agree that the NHS should remain nationalised, most also agree that Royal Mail should be nationalised (even though it now isn't). But are British Steel, Gas, Telecom and Rail valid targets for renationalisation? I'm not sure.

I lean towards nationalisation of networks (rail, telecoms inc. cable, postal network) with privatised services running on them where competition is possible. But then, structurally rail competition is impossible and the current regional set up is nonsense from a commercial point of view. Even if lines were shared it would be difficult to have true competition as there are limits in flexibility (i.e. we all want to get to work at 9am). But then you could apply the same argument to air travel. Then there is the NHS, very much not a network but very much a sensible nationalised service.

So what is a good guideline for a good/bad target for nationalisation? 

I should add, I think there is value in nationalisation as a vehicle for *improving* competition, e.g. nationalised telecoms networks allowing for multiple service companies to compete on service rather than rely on their infrastructure advantage.

By that token, every manager has failed. And at the end of the day, the average for top 4 is 70 points come the end of the year, UTD beat Hull (Which is likely) on the last day of the season they have 71 points. Regardless of the style of football played or where the results come from, that is bang on average. 

What level of football are you comparing us this season to. In terms of general play? Because if it's last season, you're very naive in thinking we could achieve the same with a completely new strike force and 6 new players.

I'm not obsessed with looking at the table and where we should be. I'm taking into consideration our team, the teams around us. Our style of football this year is woeful compared to last. However, it's compared to the teams around us. UTD us and Spurs all played poor football this year dropping the average. Difference being UTD had world class talent in each box to get them over the line. You can't pin that solely on Rodgers.

I agree we were poor in europe. A lot of our players and manager haven't played much in Europe so I can somewhat understand it, however looking at our group we should have got through. But again, I'm getting frustrated with your constant bash on Rodgers and it being down to his tactical decisions. The game vs Basel, when it mattered. We were 1 goal away from qualifying. Markovic gets sent off just after half time and I distinctly remember the majority complaining from the lack of effort from all players bar Gerrard.

This guy's a an AB, lol. The lowest rank you can be and still be allowed on board a ship from what I can tell. 

Here's some select quotes. Reeks of delusions of grandeur. 

Towards the beginning:

&gt;I am a Strategic Weapons Systems engineer who has sacrificed everything to tell the public how close it is to a nuclear catastrophe. I’ve sacrificed my freedom, time with my family and friends, a good paying career, my life savings, possibly my life itself; just to get this information out to the public, and it seems no-one wants to help me inform the public. This is more like David vs Superman than David vs Goliath, alone I have no chance, but you the people are the kryptonite.

And towards the end:

&gt;After rising from the depths I knew I had gained enough information to eliminate the biggest threat the UK faces. I also gained the knowledge that my desire to serve the people no matter what, wasn't some fantasy. I have sacrificed everything: a good career, a chance to be a millionaire by selling the information, my life savings, my freedom, quality time with family and friends, possibly my life… 

&gt;The decision to release this information was the easiest yet most painful decision of life. If I die it wasn't suicide. I'm willing to sacrifice everything, but I would never use my own hand to take my life. If I'm killed and this report is made public, there will be a high chance of a violent revolution. I'm not seeking or promoting violence.

In the afternoon have a cup of tea and pretend to work for a bit. Computer network goes down because our IT infrastructure is made out of string and sellotape. I make the most of this down time by making a cup of tea.

That being said, I think he will be sold probably to City or Chelsea.  Arsenal could bid for him, seeing as he is a pacy attacking midfielder, but I doubt they will want to pay that much for him. I would be interested to see how he develops for Chelsea if he does at all.  But as a thought experiment it would be interesting.  

I also think that there is a plan if he does go, I just don't know how good that plan is.  Winger/attacking midfielders is one of the positions that Liverpool are pretty stacked in.  Ibe, Lallana, Markovic, Origi, Borini (who I don't think will leave) all able to play across the top three depending on the formation.  Milner and Ings could also be included in that should they get them. 

One of the issues with Sterling is as a main threat he isn't quite there yet.  We see it in his lack of finishing, decision making etc.  Last season with Sturridge and Suarez he was the third person defenders worried about at least.  It gave him a lot of room to play and he blossomed in it.   Now though as a focal point he needs time to develop those skills.  

This is why I sort of think they should sell him.  I don't know if Liverpool are able to provide the support for him and I don't know if he is worth 50 million pounds or will be worth that much after next year.

null,false,strolls,null,null,null,"The teaching of computing in schools took a big leap backwards in the 90's which lasted until recently.

In the mid 70's, the only home computers were kits built by hobbyists, with about the capacity of a pocket calculator and which were often programmed by flipping switches.

By the early 80's home computers had evolved to things like the ZX81 (which was still [available as a kit](http://zx81kit.co.uk/zx81kit.html)), which has 1/1,000,000 the RAM of today's budget smartphones, but which had a keyboard. It was followed by computers like the Commodore 64 and, as part of a government computer literacy project, the [BBC Micro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro).

What was crucial about 80's home computers and their effect on the nation's computer competence is that the first thing the user saw when the computer was turned on was a basic programming prompt. These computers were designed so that you could type in simple instructions to form a program - the instructions would be executed sequentially when you typed ""run"" - and they all came with a beginners programming manual. Running software that other people wrote was the second thing you did with an 80's home computer.

(Sorry if you know this already)

The IBM PC lagged behind these computers in market penetration because IBM were invested in mainframes and didn't predict such a boom - they caught up by using off-the-shelf parts for their first personal computers (PC's) and by buying in the operating system from this Bill Gates guy.

After some reverse engineering and lawsuits, the success of today's PC rests upon the fact that other manufacturers were able to use the same off-the-shelf parts to make computers which were ""IBM PC compatible"", and also buy their operating system from this Gates guy.

IBM PCs caught on with business because they were cheap computers (although still several times the cost of a BBC Micro) made by the biggest computer company on the planet - the saying at the time was ""no-one ever got sacked for buying IBM""- and buyers could be confident of support and that software would be available for their PCs.

PC compatibles caught on for the same reasons, 'cept they were cheaper. 

So computer usage has been growing our whole lives but the difference between the 80's and the 90's is that 80's computers were more readily programable than 90's ones. When you click on the Start button of a Windows PC, there is no ready way to program it to do arbitrary tasks. That suited Bill Gates just fine, because he wanted to sell word processors and spreadsheets to businesses.

I'm not sure in what year ICT entered the curriculum, but it was a teaching of computers that focussed on using Word and entering numbers in spreadsheets, not in programming them. 

That's the difference between computer literate people in their 40's and kids leaving school today - for the former, basic computer programs are an obvious concept, whereas those leaving school today know only how to use consumer programs that other people have written.

I don't mean this comment to be all *le wrong generation*, rather that the people who set the computing curriculum in the 90's and 00's were not the kids who programmed computers in the 80's - they were older people who had not grown up with computers, and they set the curriculum that business told them to. That was about teaching teenagers office skills so that they could type letters, do accounts and enter inventory numbers, because business had embraced computers more readily than parents and (pre-internet) kids; Microsoft Word and Excel were the de facto office standards, so that's what kids were taught to use.

&gt;

&gt;A __statutory instrument__ (__SI__) is the principal form in which [delegated legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegated_legislation) is made in [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain).

&gt;Statutory instruments are governed by the [Statutory Instruments Act 1946](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_Instruments_Act_1946).  They replaced [statutory rules and orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_Rules_and_Orders), made under the Rules Publication Act 1893, in 1948.

&gt;Most delegated legislation in Great Britain is made in the form of a statutory instrument. (In [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland), delegated legislation is organised into [statutory rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_Rules_of_Northern_Ireland), rather than statutory instruments.) The advent of [devolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution) in 1999 resulted in many powers to make statutory instruments being transferred to the [Scottish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government) and [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Government) governments, and oversight to the [Scottish Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament) and [National Assembly for Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_for_Wales). Instruments made by the Scottish Government are now classed separately as [Scottish statutory instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Statutory_Instrument).

Instead we've rushed out the 'they don't suit our system' line over and over and not addressed the fact that Rodgers has not made any attempt to adjust how we set up to try get them playing to their strengths. Instead we've seen sterling shoved up top alone or one of the others when it's painfully clear IT IS NOT WORKING.

A police force is obliged to be able to respond to any degree of threat, from the most minor to serious acts of violent organised crime, widespread riots and so on.

The equipment and training for dealing with these different levels of severity are themselves different - the most serious the situation the more extreme the response. The more officers you can field the less extreme the tactics you have to use. Five officers with rubber bullets and a watercannon can take on the roles of dozens of officers with shields and batons in a riot situation.

His argument is that cuts as deep as these will require the services to lose officers - personnel are almost always the most expensive thing in an organisation. That means not having the luxury of less extreme tactics, and so the force is pressured into more severe methods of addressing serious crime.

Worse, because the police services have to be able to respond to the most severe situations, the extra funding that goes on tackling more ""minor"" crimes will be first on the chopping block too - public police patrols, training for social situations, enough officers to provide a police presence without serious kit, etc etc.

All this means that as budgets ate made tighter you'll get fewer officers on the beat, less connection to communities, a lack of attention to training and equipment design to deescalate and instead a focus on shutting crime down as quickly and efficiently as possible through a rapid response network. It means harsher responses because those responses are comparatively cheap. It means a less publicly engaged police service more likely to resort to tactics that most people would find scary or upsetting (or which are just outright dangerous).",null,0,null,1431953902,null,0,false,0,crcvr4j,null,t3_36auqp,null,t1_crcvr4j,null,t1_crcboh0,null,null,null,1433128352,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

No one would have given us much of a chance of challenging for the title with Rodgers, he did that last season all the same. So even if it looks unlikely, it's still possible. However, there is no-one out there whose going to make it a consistent reality.

I've said this numerous times, but when you're thinking Rodgers should be sacked your saying that the expectation is that he consistently finish top 4. Therefore you expect him to consistently outperform better equipped competitors regardless of the individual circumstances of a season (Rodgers losing 60 goals from the team). I would say that's unreasonable. I'm not saying stick with Rodgers if he has us 5th forever, but don't sack him because he failed to perform in a single season.

But then someone defended it as a ""global trend"". And it wasn't the Torys fault. Well that's good and well, but you need to first admit you have a problem and try to address it.

Of course, one has to draw a line somewhere, before things start turning into state capitalism or communist state-style total state ownership with complete prohibition of private venture.  Full nationalisation is an extreme throwback to Old Old Labour, and not even Attlee or Wilson pursued it IIRC!

However, resources and electorate patience limited as they are, I'd like to see things nationalised in a priority order, if and when they become feasible to do so.  The NHS, for me, would be the priority, as a vital service with ethical hang-ups over the profit motive.  Then, I'd probably go for rail—as you point out, the current system doesn't work, and no properly competitive system would work either, _and_ the rail network is still a powerful element of infrastructure.

Royal Mail would also be nice to renationalise, though I imagine it would be very difficult to do in any way other than slowly buying up shares for the government (please excuse my lack of economics grokking!).  It's a vital universal infrastructural service, and there's a healthy market for competition in areas where different service is wanted (couriers, faster delivery, etc).

For me, renationalising or setting up state competitors to everything else Thatcher and Major sold off (National Bus Company, British Gas, British Telecom, British Steel, water boards, etc.) would be a nice bonus, but by the time any government gets this far down the list I imagine there'll be very little money, time, and public interest to pursue.

I'd only spend money on a keeper if Hugo leaves, and even then, I trust Vorm to be our #1.  Walker, Fredericks, and Yedlin are good for RB.  With Wimmer coming in, I'd trust a CB rotation of Vert, Dier, Fazio, and Wimmer, with Veljkovic hopping in from time-to-time.  Rose and Davies are excellent for LB.

For our pivot pairing, I think finding the right partner for Bentelab is the most important piece of the transfer window; Schneiderlin is the obvious choice, but really anyone that does what Mason is doing now but is better at tracking defenders and shielding the back four.  Alli would be a good depth option for Benetlab's spot in midfield.  

While I would love to have a shiny new winger, honestly, I think what we have now is adequate.  Obviously I'd take an upgrade if we had one, but Lamela, Chadli, and Townsend are all good players when they're on form.  We definitely need at least one more winger, either as depth or as a replacement.

I think we already have our answer to a decent back-up for Eriksen in our youth system.  Between Pritchard, Winks, and Onomah, we have enough young talent to compete for being Eriksen's depth option.  And while getting a decent back-up to Harry Kane is essential, I feel as if we won't need to spend much money to find one from the regulation candidates.

Income inequality *in itself* is not a problem; it only becomes a problem when the rich get richer *at the expense of* the poor. But that is not what is happening. People forget that we are still recovering from the financial crisis (which no individual person can be blamed for), and so the poor will naturally suffer due to spending and tax cuts which are necessary. These tax cuts are not just the rich, but across the board. PA will rise to £12,500 by 2020 and the middle-income bracket will be loosened. The debate is not whether we should cut, but the depth: in any case, the poor will suffer. This might seem unfair, but if we don't cut then there is a massive risk that it'll just get a whole lot worse.

As for the blog post, the suggested solutions - their vagueness ignored - are all what the government has been doing since 2007 (yes, including Labour). The trick is to do it slowly so that the market can adjust comfortably without being caught off-guard. Remember that a sudden, large, nation-wide increase in the minimum wage will have massive repercussions, so time needs to be taken.

* The one who steals is sane

* He has reached puberty

* He steals equivalent to the amount (nisab) or more. The Nisab is one Dinar or ten Dirhams (i.e. 4.374 grams of gold).

The Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him &amp; give him peace) said: “There is no cutting (of hands) for stealing that is less than ten Dirhams.” (Musnad Ahmad)


A’isha (Allah be pleased with her) reports that “The hands were not cut in the time of the Messenger of Allah for stealing worthless things.” (Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah)


A’isha (Allah be pleased with her) narrates that: “The hand of a thief was not cut off during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him &amp; give peace) except for stealing something equal to a shield in value.” (Sahih al-Bukhari, 6792, &amp; Sahih Muslim, 1685)
A shield was worth one Dinar at that time, as narrated by Ibn Abbas in Sunan Abu Dawud &amp; Sunan Nasa’i

* He steals the article from a place that meets the requirements of security and safeguarding. This security is considered when the article is safeguarded by a guard or by it being locked up in a place.

* The article is in the ownership of another person.

* There is no confusion in it (as to whether he took it by way of theft or for some other reason).

* It was stolen secretly (not by force, etc…).

If any of the above conditions are not met, then the penalty of theft will not be established.

Lambert is too too long in the tooth now, doesn't have the pace to play in our system and with new players coming in will be pretty far down in the pecking order. He could do very well with a mid-table club and he'd be better off moving on.

Borini is just not good enough. He's never shown any glimpses of becoming a player good enough for a top 4 team. He should have gone last season, but to his credit, he stayed and tried to force his way into the team. It hasn't happened and hopefully now he'll realize that it never will.

Balotelli, despite being terrible this season, has proven in the past that when his head is right he can be an absolute beast. We might never see 'beast mode' at Anfield but of these three players - he's the one who could make a difference - if he plays at his top level.

I agree that there are now more top teams than there once were, hence making title challenges nearly impossible and top-four much more difficult. The main crux of this (as we seem to agree on again) is money. Our budget is absolutely dwarfed by Chelsea's, Utd's, City's, and Arsenal's.

Where I disagree however is with your next few points.

&gt; The money that those teams you mentioned earn currently will see us fall behind

This has already happened as far as I see it. There is no great rush to panic and fix things immediately on the pitch, as we fell behind significantly about five years ago, and the only way to catch up financially is to grow our stadium, and/or make massive commercial deals. Both of these are in the works, but will take years to bear fruit.

&gt;We have gone 3 years with this bullshit.

Which three years under Brendan were they? Was one his first year, where he steadied a sinking ship that had just finished 8th, and brought in exciting youngsters Coutinho and Sturridge to see us finish on an exciting high?

Or was it last year, when we finished second in the league, scored more than 100 goals and played possibly the most exciting football seen in the league for years?

This year has obviously been a disappointment, but to say we've had three years of bullshit is a hysterical exaggeration.

I believe the only way to get back into the top-four consistently without massively increasing our budget, is to develop enough Sterlings, Markovics, Emre Cans and Coutinhos that eventually one or two of them become Suarezs. Maybe we convince a few of these Suarezs to stay, and then we have a team that will perform the way we want it to.

null,false,Froolow,null,null,null,"So obviously the 'everyone who works in finance is unskilled' meme is just a lefty circlejerk, but there is actually a sound economic reason to think that senior management in the private sector are overpaid relative to their performance.

Imagine you have 10 employees on £20k / year and one manager on £40k / year. You have £10k / year to motivate your junior staff - what's the best way to do that?

One suggestion is to divide the £10k depending on contribution. Each employee will get roughly £1k, which will probably motivate them to work a bit harder, but they'll work harder to their marginal contribution (i.e. they'll work 10% harder if they get 10% more money, but not any harder than is nescessary)

Another method is that you give the whole £10k to the manager (who is now on £50k) and tell the employees that when the manager retires, the hardest working employee gets their job. Now the employee who works the hardest gets a £30k bonus, and everyone else gets nothing; it isn't enough to work a bit harder, you have to work a bit harder than the second hardest-working employee to get any reward at all. Since everybody has to work their hardest to stay in the race, you get a huge productivity boost. This is a bit like a 'dollar auction', if you've ever heard of that before - everyone is better off not playing, but once they've started they can't stop.

So the manager's salary is £40k that he or she 'deserves', plus £10k that is only there to motivate the other employees to work harder.

I just kind of thought you might be interested in the theory - it suggests that the meme that city jobs are overpaid is slightly true, but mostly false (except perhaps at *very* senior levels, at sort of board level and upwards).",null,1,null,1431957724,null,0,1431959195,0,crcxeud,null,t3_36cg0d,null,t1_crcxeud,null,t1_crcx442,null,null,null,1433129144,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

Muhammed married and had  sex with a 9 year old.

Kane situ is an interesting one. Can he be as hot as he has been this year next year? Would another top tier ST rock the boat?

I expect the board will do the ""English"" thing and chase Ings or Austin.

If we shift Dembele, Lennon and Townsend as I expect  (sorry guys - side note: I expect Paulinho to stay - you heard it here first) then we'll need one senior guy to support and nurture Pritchard and Alli who I assume will be brought in.

If Lloris goes, then expect to see a co-equal young number 1 to come in. Vorm will likely get the nod, but if too many Leicester's happen then he will be ruthlessly returned to the bench.

Sometimes... but a lot of social spending ends up in the hands of the relatively wealthy. Via unforeseen consequences. Take for example housing benefit.

This just puts a floor on rents, so a shitty flat the kind I lived in during the 90s would be what £13 a week. Add in housing benefit and suddenly its £60 a week because of the floor. Does the housing benefit make the house better in any tangible manner? Or simply distort the market.

Same with a lot of things if people didn't get that social spending would they spend it on what they spend it on? Things like nurseries which are an explosive growth area it seems (there are many around were I live which are less than 3 years old). What drives this government funding?

The benefit in kind value is reported to HMRC by your employer; it is primarily determined by list price (aka. P11D value), fuel type and CO2 emissions figure of the vehicle.

Using a company car salary sacrifice scheme should work out cheaper than a private contract hire *for an equivalent car*, especially for low emission cars, but it is still not free (even Zero-Emission Cars are taxed at 5% of the P11D value). Below is a simple illustration using some default figures (£30,000 salary &amp; £6,000 ex VAT company contract hire (£7,200 inc VAT for private contract hire)):

**Example 1: Company Car Salary Sacrifice**

* £6,000 salary sacrifice to offset cost to company of car hire. £4,600 BIK value.
* £24,000 paid to self at 600L tax code.
* **£18,488** received after tax.

**Example 2: Private Contract Hire**

* £30,000 paid to self at default 1060L tax code. 
* £23,487 received after tax.
* **£16,287** left after private contract hire.

Numbers *will* vary these are just for general illustrative purposes.

Only that sort of thinking can be correct leading to some serious intellectual stagnation. Deep arrogance that we're masters of the world and nothing is going to go wrong.

What happens is the family heads meet with the prospective MPs, discuss any under-the-table deals that need doing to gain their votes etc, then decide amongst themselves who everyone from all their families will vote for, which ends up being a lot of votes.  To avoid the chance of family members not voting for who they decided, everyone is registered for postal voting, so the family heads fill in and deliver everyone's ballots themselves in bulk.

He runs with his head down, and is quite unaware of everything around him. He also never seems to be in total control, and rarely looks composed on the ball. He is small and is often out muscled and hasn't seemed to put on any weight since joining about a year ago. His finishing is lacking any sort of composure.

In one word: pressing. 

Liverpool has a young team from the front to the back (especially after Gerrard's departure). If you want someone that embodies what the style is, look at Henderson and Allen. High work rate, hassle the opposition into misplaying a pass. In Hendo's case more than Allen, after regaining possession immediately look to release your striker who just made a run between defenders. This Countinho as well, perfect at reading between the defensive lines and releases defense splitting passes onto a running Suarez, Sterling or Sturridge.  

Fast, counter attacking, high energy. Force the opposition into a bad pass and immediately counter. That's the Brendan Rodger's system. However, one key piece that must be noted in the defensive midfielder to clean up the pieces when the other two central midfielders are out of position. Granted Rodgers only figured it out this season (and understood he had to drop Gerrard for Lucas).

In a system like this, there's no room for a passenger. Especially not a striker that refuses to make runs between the lines. This team with Sturridge versus without it is like night and day. That's why Sterling is thrown up front because he makes those runs. Whether it is with 2 up front and Coutinho in the hole, or the fluid 4-3-3 that has two wingers up front making similar runs, it is all about pressing, movement and the subsequent counter. This is why Liverpool struggles so much against parked buses that refuse to budge and stop the counter.

im sure other people can verify this as well. just go to the man u sub reddit and ask for quotes on Scholes. Gerrard has achieved 1 CL (albeit one of the most thrilling games I've ever watched) and I cant think of much outside. The truth is and people are realising it now, the carling cup and FA cup are not major trophies (at least not worthy of being credited as elite success), i dont know how many FA cups or Carling cups Gerrard has won but you measure players by the major trophies they win (Premier league and Champions league). Are you American? I wouldnt expect you to understand with all the media hype that you've probably seen of Gerrard. Ask the majority of  football fans that dont support United or Liverpool and they will tell you there is no comparison between Gerrard and Scholes.

I'm not even going to delve in to how our defence is better than both Madrid and Barca's as you only have to look at their performances in midweek. 

For the midfield's Real usually line up with Kroos, Rodriguez and Modric. None of these three offer much defensively and are easily over run by any decent midfield. Rodriguez in the number 10 role offers more than Oscar going forward with more goals and assists but can't offer anywhere near as much going back. Fàbregas and Matic as a pairing offer more in defensive and attacking output than Kroos and Modric. 

Barcelona line up with Busquet's, Rakitic and Iniesta. Iniesta is a fantastic player but doesn't offer up as much of a goal threat as he used to, and although decent in defence isn't as skilled as Oscar, Matic or Fàbregas. Busquet's is arguably the best defensive midfielder in the world (although for me it's Matic) but offers next to nothing in attack with dreadful finishing (thankfully for us in 2012) and not the best eye for an assist.  Rakitic is both solid in defence and attack without being amazing in either. 

Both Barcelona and Madrid's strength lie in their attacking trio, especially Messi and Ronaldo...",null,1,null,1431962004,null,0,false,0,crczno9,null,t3_36bea5,null,t1_crczno9,null,t1_crcy9ns,null,null,null,1433130202,null,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2,null

I'm not trying to be abtuse but your just repeating a baseless assertion. I've pointed out the flaw in your reasoning.

Super religous is relative. Muslims are the most visably  observant by far. Islam is also deeply repulsive in its teachings with little wiggle room. Christians play mental gymnastics over editing and translation. The quran is aparantly a pure transcription

*He should definitely give his English degree back, yes.*

In the past five years 84 theatres in the United Kingdom have either been closed or are no longer being used. According to The Theatre Trust of Great Britain that’s just over 6% of all the theatres they recognise and actively try to protect. But if you live in London you may not have noticed as you're living in the metaphorical bubble of theatre protection, which stretches all the way from Wembley to Dartford. Everywhere outside of those areas are fair-game apparently, and this is where the war between the arts and politics begins.

 
This battle started back in the 1980s when **Margret Thatcher** introduced cuts to the arts for the first time. Something to this day I still don’t completely understand. In 1988 a report from the Political Studies Institute came out in favour of the **arts. Showing** that in a year it had become the fastest growing economic sector in the U.K. With an annual **turn over** of £10 billion and offering up 500,000 jobs it was hard to complain. But the cuts kept coming and this time they were even more ruthless. Ten years later another report came out claiming that the **west end** grosses £1.1 billion per year alone. In 2004 the theatre industry as a whole was worth over £2.6 billion, and all theatres outside of London were making a direct contribution to the local economy. They called it ‘the knock-on effect’. The theatre **hire’s** their cast and crew locally as well as all props and stage equipment **then with the money they earn from productions goes towards the staff** who buy things from a local company who then disperse it across the constituency. Another bonus of having a theatre in your town is AVS (additional visitor spend) **this is when** a theatre attraction leads people to spend money on other services such as travel and food. It benefits London more with an average AVS of £53.77 per person, but the **non London** theatres aren’t doing too badly with £7.77 per person. In the **same study** *[which study?]* **it determined** that UK theatre (despite having over 16,000 volunteers across the country) has most of **it’s** staff working full-time jobs and guaranteeing work safety- something **people crave for** today. In **todays** world the arts industry is responsible for 0.5% of the UK’s jobs which is roughly just over **660,000 meaning** despite Government cuts the employment rate has actually risen. This is because 0.1% of Government spending is spent on culture and the arts returns the equivalent 0.4% back. **So they’re being used as a business ploy by the House of Commons.** With just 16p per ticket funded by our Government we have the least subsidised theatre industry in all of Europe but we earn the most **money, theatre** is more popular than all the Premier League, Football League and Scottish league fans combined. Hence why in 2013 London’s West-End alone contributed £95million in NAT.

This means that theatres are having to get their funding **elsewhere, most** try and get it from previous ticket sales which is why they’ve been bumping up the price. But some popular theatres in the West-End are now corporate run, which means a corporation has given the least amount of money possible to have the most influence in the theatre. The actors union Equity think this leads to a lack of risk which creates a black hole of dull plays/musicals and lower wages for actors who aren’t Benedict Cumberbatch. The reality is that only 15% of theatres are funded directly from the Government and the rest have to try and beg for money from their local councils. **This leads to theatre closures, but and possibly more importantly.** Despite the 'big 200’ theatres constantly **now producing new things**, the rest of our theatres aren’t actually producing anything new. They’re putting on a few low-budget plays a year and earning most of their money through touring companies. Which means the question isn’t why are our theatres disappearing. The question is why aren’t they doing anything?


 
Popularity isn’t the issue as in 2004 even though the **West End were contributing** **the £1.5 billion to the £2.6 billion** **non London based** theatres were contributing at least £1.1 billion. **It’s** effect on society is **huge many** setting up youth groups and having great success within them. The problem of course boils down to funding. **Many theatres weren’t expecting such severe cuts as they were relying on whatever money they did get to put on shows**. Ticket sales can only go so far and if you’re not a huge West End London **theatre corporate** funding is **few and far between**. This has led the unemployment figures in the arts to **sky rocket** in the past few years. **As even the most recent study conducted by Sheffield University in 2004 looks like a completely different generation regarding the employment of creatives in the UK**. Local people aren’t worth the risk **anymore they’re** not seen as a viable source of income. So you’ve now got theatres saving up their budget for months to hire a mildly successful celebrity to headline there. This is starting to create a disconnected society within the industry. Actors being forced to flock to London or being forced into a career change mid-way through their lives. It amazing to see even the smallest plays in the smallest theatres are being sold out and the funding for these places doesn’t go up in the slightest.

We’re experiencing a crisis in the UK theatre industry, a blatant show of inequality and nothing can be done about it. The arts have always been a secret passion to many, but now that passion must be given up. Theatres are vanishing and **84 for of them** have disappeared but the rest are just in hiding waiting to come out when it’s safe to breathe, and for the love of art let’s hope that’s soon.",null,0,null,1431962356,null,0,1431966458,0,crczuu3,null,t3_36ct3m,null,t1_crczuu3,null,t1_crcygwu,null,null,null,1433130296,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,Hhhaamuus,null,null,null,"&gt;I'm gonna have to call bullshit on this one. It's a nice contribution to the lefty circle jerk but makes no sense. Why would a business pay that salary for such an unskilled job? 

It's mainly because it used to be a skilled job before computer programs took over, and the industry still needs entry level workers to eventually progress to more senior positions. They now have far less to do than a similar position used to, but there are no other entry level positions that you can use to weed out the prospects.

A second element is how separated management are from their workers. The guy doing spreadsheet analysis 15 years ago might now be a manager setting the pay for the spreadsheet guy - he's unaware of just how easier the job is now (he knows it's easier, but not that it's piss easy for someone who grew up with a computer), and sets a salary with his mind set on what he earned back then.

A third element is simple ""prestige"" - they believe the banking industry should command a certain salary.

A fourth one is profit sharing. A company might look at the profit they generate and think that salaries need to come up in order to keep the natives from getting restless! (In other words, companies which see profits shoot up and wages stagnate, often find themselves with a whole new set of staff a year later).

I think the comment itself was an exaggeration - you don't find people with no responsibility or skill, but you definitely find people who work less than many relatively low paid jobs, for way more money. I would wager most entry level bankers have way more free time, and way less stress than a nurse for example.

You don't seem to have a clue how the international economics work, *the entire world economy shat itself*. The UK had a relatively small part of a much larger International Rescue package  (7Bn out a much larger pool of 97Bn) to ""bail"" out Ireland, In actual fact they where bailing out the banking sector. Specifically to stop a ""Bank Run"", that is that international finance would flock to Ireland and therefore out of the UK (as well as other financial institutions across the globe). Given that Ireland was the first country to announce that it would shore up the failing private banking sector (regardless of the consequences). This strategy would be followed in the next few days and months by the UK and then the US. The entire world economy was in freefall, measures where taken by states through public monies to try and stabilise the private sector. The Economy shitting itself was international in scale.

It's laughable that some idiot's have formed a narrative around a complex series of events in international finance and bludgeoned it into a simplistic little story to fit their simplistic little world view.

First he installed the 4-3-3 with the press as his go to strategy. Then he saw the rise of Suarez and built the team around him at the front despite Suarez initially having a low conversion rate the season before. Late on in the season he switch to the 4-4-2 diamond last season to incorporate the in form Studge and Suarez. Later on last season, Gerrard was reinvented as a deep lying playmaker which helped unlock some stubborn teams. 

After being found out defensively this season, he switched to Lucas there this season and kicked off our undefeated streak with a switch to 3 back. All the while showing the intelligence to use Can as a CB in place of the ailing Lovren. This all but instantly fixed the defensive woes of early season this year.

EDIT: THIS STUDY IGNORES THE EFFECTS OF TAXES. A real income of £100k is considered as £170k, while a real income of £10k is considered as around £10250. This means that countries with more progressive taxation will be inherently more unequal by this study's methods.

First, this is 2011 data, so well done to all those who are blaming the tories or the coalition.

Second this is on wage inequality, not income inequality, or we'd see the 50% youth unemployed in Spain and Greece factor in. Young people earn less than older people, so if half your young people don't earn, your wages become more equal. 

Third, brain drain from eastern Europe will help their inequality by cutting the high end of their wages down.

Positive: gives us as much width as possible, gives us an out ball, and the guy is QUICK so can beat his fullback.

Negative: his final ball. I think this will drastically improve with his confidence back, and with a full season behind him, plus additional coaching.

You might have hit on something here, though - I've only been working in the UK since July 1, 2014. But, surely, if HMRC had taken a year's worth of tax in the past 10 months, my deductions would have gone _down_ this year, as they're to be spread over 12 months...

Or are you saying that last year, I should have paid more?

Or that, when I started working two months into the tax year (last year), I should essentially have had a couple of months where I worked tax-free, then be charged tax on subsequent payments after I'd reached the 10k threshold? If that's the case, shouldn't I be owed money by HMRC?

I'm not entirely sure what I just wrote made sense. I'm very confused.

I think the Labour Party has correctly identified major problems within Britain (inequality) and the world at large (climate change) but has not provided solutions that the electorate could believe in. I think it's worth wondering what the Tories would do if they believed in fixing either of those problems and how Conservative-style policies for fixing, e.g., inequality, could be packaged as part of a platform that Labour could adopt.

So, how would we want to deal with inequality? Well, we'd attempt to constrain the market (price freezes, rent controls, a higher minimum wage); we'd redistribute through taxation; perhaps we'd even just let the trade unions do their job. And the public, to varying degrees, would hate us for it, even though it'd work.

What would the Tories do to deal with inequality? They'd encourage home ownership (help-to-buy, right-to-buy); they'd encourage share ownership; they'd -- maybe -- destroy monopolies in order to lower prices. There's absolutely no reason Labour can't do those things, and it would also, to some extent work. In fact, there's no reason we couldn't adopt a mixture of both hypothetical platforms, leaving the Tories with nowhere to go if they decided to tackle inequality while leaving us able to brush off criticism from the left that we weren't being left enough.

I wasn't suggesting it was. I simply didn't know.

&gt;And I never mentioned anything about the circumstances about Dortmund.

It doesn't matter whether you mentioned it - it's incredibly important.

A club that has easy access to the CL and only needs 1 team to fuck up to win the Bundesliga is a better prospect than us - we're seen as no-hopers who've qualified once for the CL in 5 years.
Being German also helps. They're better able to attract German or German-based talent that's of much higher quality and far better value.

But further to that, and with regards to bargains like Lewandowski and Reus, who would be the profile of players that we possibly could attract (when Dortmund signed them, not now), we've tried to sign a raft of young exciting talent but most of them have just arrived this season.

We don't know how Markovic, Can, Moreno and the rest are going to turn out. We have seen 1 success already in Coutinho and Sturridge and Sakho almost have been but for injuries, but we're not at the stage where we can properly assess how the rest will turn out because it hasn't happened yet.

And that's not to say we've done as good a job as Dortmund either. Dortmund obviously did incredible business.
But that incredible team was picked apart and they haven't managed to get themselves right again this season. And that's without mentioning that half of them seem to be perma-crocks.

It's easy to laud their transfer and scouting system, but can they continuously replicate the success they've had in building that great title-winning team?

Suarez was good but he wasn't world class when Rodgers came. He went from 17 goals to 30 under Rodgers so BR has some responsibility for developing Suarez. Sturridge was a Chelsea reject who was always played on the wing and wasted. Rodgers saw his striking potential and without injuries Sturridge would be up there with Kane, Costa and Aguero in goals scored this season.

&gt; he doesn't seem to be able to motivate players 

What makes you think that? I always look at how players press to see if they really want to work for a manager because they wouldn't do it much if they didn't care but we are a team in the league that are known for our good pressing and we got a goal on Saturday from it.

&gt; Klopp as an example, he is loved by the media and his players are always praising him

The media aren't kind to Wenger and Jose but they aren't poor motivators.

Also on Klopp players called Rodgers very tactically stubborn for using the same tactic that wasn't working for 5 games in a row...This season Dortmund were at the bottom of the league because Klopp kept using the same tactic that had been found out. According to whoscored our most common formation is the 343 (which was stopped when it got found out quickly actually) which was used 13 times. Dortmund used the 4231, 28 times so more than double.

null,false,elevenbars,null,null,null,"Trident's purpose is to act as an independent nuclear deterrent. It's the belief of most military strategists that it fails to fill two of the terms given by the name of its purpose; it's not independent and isn't an adequate deterrent.

We already have systems in place such as NATO etc., that would serve to protect our country were we to be suddenly invaded by the Russians or something - this acts as a far more suitable deterrent than the threat of second-strike capability. Obviously NATO depends on the cooperation of NATO states, the main player here is likely to be the USA - so there's an argument that if the US were to have some sort of conflict of interest in coming to save our asses, then we'd need some sort of independent capability in addition to our armed forces.

This is where Trident is seen to come into its own - the country can, without any approval or interference from other states - fire nuclear missiles on up to four targets almost anywhere in the world. 

**Except it can't**.

Trident fails to be independent, as the warheads and part of the electronics are of questionable american ownership and/or origin. There's a group of lease agreements that present a situation where, say the US decides not to come to the UK's aid as part of NATO; the US could potentially disable our ability to use Trident anyway. 

Now I'm not saying they have backdoors in Trident. I'll leave you to make up your own mind about the definite certainty that the USA would put a backdoor into a foreign nuclear weapons system.

Essentially, we are paying 5bn/yr for a completely redundant and useless weapons system. All it serves to do is make our dicks look slightly bigger for anyone who isn't looking at the full picture of our defence. Trident isn't worth it.

That's not to say that a replacement for Trident wouldn't be brilliant. An Independent Nuclear Deterrent is a great backbone for the defence of the nation. But Trident doesn't fill those boots; its just an incredible waste of money. And a replacement for Trident is pretty cost prohibitive; we're already in an age of military decline, the government isn't about to approve ~£300Bn for a new system when our armed forces have already been gutted - nor should it, as much as I personally would like to see a real replacement and a more independent defence of our nation.

go the route as stated as from this route you will just look like you are entering a normal park, but as you quickly reach the summit of the hill you will see the amazing viewpoint... its the best panoramic view of London you can see many of the landmarks from this view.

heres a few snaps of it but to be honest it doesnt really do it justice...

you really want to get there and see the sunset and then the city lit up at night.... which will be around 8pm uk time...

try and take a bottle of champagne and some glasses without her knowing in your backpack (its ok to drink alcohol in the park) and a blanket as it will be a bit cold.

the park will be busy at first depending on the weather but it will start emptying towards the night... but there will be a few tourists up there still seeing the view point so don't expect it to be completely empty.

once you have done the deed, head down to primrose hill high street (regents park road) which is about a 2 minute walk... go to one of the numerous restaurants or pubs in one of the best areas in london.

thank me later. :)

null,false,seamushoo4,lfc68,,null,"player development, as stated before, with players like suarez, sturridge, and serling. also take a look at how he changed henderson, wisdom, flanno, ibe and less notably (and probably most difficultly) stewart downing and jose enrique. those two, during BRs first stint were complete shit...he turned them back around. 

man management as well is another strength. every player who is intereviewed talks about the individual analysis that BR does on every player and how he thinks they can improve. he takes players and specializes their training for each player. that's unique and definitely a strength. 

i personally think, much to the chagrin of most of this sub's ""rodger's out contingent"", that BR is a brilliant interviewee. He handles questions brilliantly well, dodges the questions that he shouldn't answer and generally does well to deflect attention away from certain players. people will point to the balotelli media circus and how he handled that, but it must be exhausting to get asked about him 20 times per press conference. i think BR did a good job of sheltering balo and raheem this season, while also handling the gerrard PR fiasco very well. 

i believe that BR is building a rep as a good young coach, who develops young players...so i think that's a good rep to have. what he doesn't have quite yet, if he ever will, is the ability to attract stars. the work he's done with sturridge, suarez, reinventing gerrard last year, etc...players do take notice so i think his pull is increasing, but not at a top level yet. 

finally, i think he's a brilliant coach tactically. interestingly, this season, he was pretty poor in this regard. i think it was painfully obvious from the start of the season that our formations would not work with danny in there...we should have been more bold from an earlier stage and tinkered with different formations that were going to maximise the strength that (we actually) do possess in defense and midfield, while try to maximise the abilities of coutinho and raheem in particular. i think a 4-4-2 variation with balo/lambo as a target man and raheem running off of that would have worked brilliantly..or a 4-3-3- variation that had borini/sterling/coutinho interchanging could have worked...but we needed to move away from what we did at the beginning. i give great credit to the 3-4-3 formation he ended up with in the winter because that saved our season from utter humilation, but i think that shows the kind of courage he does possess. BR would rather get sacked trying something bold and different, than sacked by being boring and still not getting results. his greatest overall strength is he knows the ins and outs of his team by mid season and is able to get the most out of his team by maximising players, not formations. that's a unique quality to have in a coach.

In my experience most dentists make a kneejerk recommendation against braces due to their small but innate risk to tooth health (in that they make it more difficult to brush properly), which is their foremost concern. 

However an orthodontist will take a slightly wider view with consideration of your entire facial structure, the long term function of your jaw joint, wear patterns and tightness of tooth contacts, any mental health factors related to your facial appearance, etc. All of these things could amount to a clear clinical reason for treatment which your regular dentist may never have acknowledged, because that's not technically within his limited purview of limiting/filling caries. 

I'm currently undergoing NHS orthodontic treatment: I've had four extractions, will be getting braces fitted for about a year and upper jaw surgery to correct an open bite. All will be done completely free of charge. Feel free to PM me if you'd like to know more about my experiences with the system.

A big sticking point about the team and Martinez was that by around December, we had been ""found out"" i.e. teams knew exactly how we'd play (pass it all around) and it was easy to counter, hence the really poor fun of form heading into Kiev's two legs.

But Kiev exploited this to an amazing degree at their place -  they were down 2-1 and had nothing to lose by being wildly aggressive.  All they did that entire game was just simply run at us.  Tactically they weren't anything special - they were just constantly hitting long balls and chasing, and it was working.  We were constantly caught off guard.  They took shots from range because they knew we don't press up in the box and challenge.  It was an incredible microcosm of all of Everton's weaknesses - poor goalie positioning, passive and passionless defense, lack of sustained pace, and poor offensive synchronicity that too often resulted in turnovers.  We were never ever in control, and it was just abysmal to see it all crumble like that.

I felt like Man U was our best game - simply because it was a great example of how to use possession against a team.  Just sponge up all their pace into the final third, then stymie them.  And from time to time, counter like a beast and even score a goal off of it.  Roberto's been all about holding onto the ball but I think when teams win possession that much but can't do anything with it, they get more desperate and out of sync as the game goes on.

If Arsenal meet the release clause and we still turn them down, then they can't do shit about it. It's ultimately a contract between LFC and Suarez, so there's no grounds to file a lawsuit because from a legal standpoint they're a 3rd party to the contract and it's none of their business. The only person who can file a lawsuit is Suarez, except the whole process would take several months, all the while his career would be in limbo (and it's possible during that time he wouldn't be able to play for either club) and it's really debatable whether it'd be a positive thing for his career at that stage even if he won. 

There was some stuff about Suarez's release clause maybe not being watertight but either way it would have taken him suing the club to force a move to Arsenal and FSG were fairly heavily banking on him not wanting to leave quite that badly.

Fletcher was an important part of that but he was the only one that made them function under pressure.

It happened time and time again with us playing them - we'd totally dominate because our midfield was the shit under Benitez, but we'd almost never get the result we ""deserved"" because we didn't have the firepower to back it up.

Obviously, when you added firepower in the shape of peak Gerrard and Torres, then we utterly demolished them, and their record in Europe, where they faced similar troubles, was fairly poor considering their domestic dominance.

We failed to win the league under Benitez, not because our midfield wasn't strong enough - it was strong enough to dominate all our rivals and finish top of the top 4 mini-league in 08-09 and have us punch above our weight in it most seasons - but because we didn't have the depth of attacking players. We wern't even that far off - Gerrard and Torres were amazing together. But we were probably 1 other attacker short. That's what lead to dropping points against Stoke and Hull.

We don't need a Suarez to make our team work. You drop Suarez into this team and it would challenge for the league. We don't have to be that ambitious at this point.

Just by doing nothing and taking the sane view that Sturridge won't have as bad a season for injuries and having Origi - a player who has something that each of Lambert, Ballotelli and Borini lack (pace, work rate and technical ability respectively), we should be a little better off by default.

I think you've missed the issue there; everyone at the club knew Sturridge was an injury problem, he's been one in the past. That's why we didn't try to replace Suarez with potential, but with proven quality - Sanchez, Remy, etc. 

The single biggest problem this season is that we fucked up the most important transfer, replacing Suarez, by buying a striker that didn't suit us at all in Balotelli.

You can argue Rodgers could've done more to make the side work around Balotelli's strengths, and that's fair.

Man, you must be a pain to debate with in person where the entire conversation hasn't been written out for all to see. Lets recap:

So while you never said it directly, you strongly imply that crime has not fallen by stating ""Crime figures have been manipulated and reconfigured to the point of being meaningless."" in response to the statement ""Crime figures are falling"".

Hence, you're going to get a reply stating that you're wrong and any belief that crime hasn't fallen is purely down to perception.

Now, you can say ""but I never explicitly said crime hasn't fallen"", and you'd be right. But ultimately what was the point of your comment if not to challenge that crime has fallen?

Usually come March or April, top teams come into form because they add players over the summer, but we have simply taken steps backward since March.

This is something I don't understand, how it is so common to ask why cyclists are on the road, or taking a whole lane. Why do people in cars feel disadvantaged or inconvenienced when they are behind a cyclist on the road? There is no right to travel, at full speed, unobstructed on a public road. I, on a bike, often have to slow down for traffic, or wide vehicles, or pedestrians. That's just part of operating in a public space, we all use it, and have to deal with each other.

 It's like getting angry because you can't run, full speed up the stairs in an underground station at rush hour, of course you can't, other people are using it too, that's what it's for. So you might just have to walk for a minute until things clear out a bit.

And we pay for it, as much if not more than many drivers. Don't forget there is no ""road fund"" in the UK any more. Roads are paid for from general funds. Petrol tax, vehicle registration, etc. go into the general fund. So if you pay any tax, you are paying for the roads.

If you look at tape from last year, you'll find that we looked the most dangerous when we had breaks against the opponents defense after a period of possession drew the midfield out of position, which is where Barkley thrives. See arsenal at home last year, that's a perfect example of what I'm talking about. We scored a fair number of our goals through this quasi-counter. When a team just put bodies behind the ball, we found it difficult to break through, as our players aren't the most creative in the world, particularly the front line. We got lucky with some set piece wizardy against teams that came into Goodison looking for a point, and that covered some cracks in the side.

This term, opponents have figured out that if they just press with the forwards and mark tightly on the flanks, we are far less effective. We've been forced to break down disciplined defenses, which is not what this squad is good at. We need a creative midfielder, a true number 10, who can play that final ball to unlock a back line.

Well... kinda. It's more that it's part of the strange, twisted game that is MAD, and playing that game *requires* you to act in a ""childish"" way in order to prevent nuclear war.

There's a concept in nuclear strategy known as a ""counterforce strike"". The goal of a counterforce strike is to destroy your opponent's nuclear weapons (or otherwise prevent them from using them against you) before they can do unacceptable damage to you in return.

If you're in the hypothetical (and unenviable) position of leading a country engaged in MAD, you need to be absolutely certain that an attack on you results in nuclear retaliation in order to prevent that attack from happening in the first place. That means that you need to react as quickly as possible to these attacks -- otherwise, it's possible that someone may decide they can strike you and take out your weapons before you get a chance to respond, and if that's so, then you're no longer deterring them. 

This necessity -- ensuring that nobody can take out your nukes before you use them -- is why launch-on-warning is a thing.",null,0,null,1431969270,null,0,false,0,crd3y8s,null,t3_36b0u0,null,t1_crd3y8s,null,t1_crcuqqy,null,null,null,1433132226,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I didnt once say that winning the champions league more times makes you a better player.

Even though it doesn't seem like it on the surface, those on the right of politics fully appreciate and understand the diminishing marginal utility of wealth. The thing most people don't consider is that countries need to have a competitive tax rate to attract wealthy people and businesses.

For an example of this, imagine the UK top tax bracket is 50% and 1 million wealthy people choose to live in the UK under these circumstances. Now imagine the tax rate is reduced to 40% and now 2 million wealthy people choose to live here. Well 40% of 2 million is more than 50% of 1 million. Too much importance is often placed on **the rate** of tax wealthy people and businesses pay when in fact it's **the absolute amount** of tax the government can collect from them which is important, as this is the money they have to distribute among everyone else. 

IMO as long as everyone is getting richer it shouldn't matter that some are getting rich faster than others. Historically countries that have punished success by overtaxing the rich have done worse than those who reward success by letting them keep more of their income. Unfortunately this leads to inequality, but the underlying problem is not tax rates within a country, it's beggar thy neighbour tax policies between countries. As long as countries are trying to undercut each other to attract wealthy people, governments will always have to balance the negatives of wealth inequality with the negatives of overtaxing people and businesses.",null,0,null,1431969846,null,0,false,0,crd4b1r,null,t3_36cvy6,null,t1_crd4b1r,null,t3_36cvy6,null,null,null,1433132394,null,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15,null

The quality bar must be pretty low in the Guardian, which whether its name appears online or in print should at least have some standards than continue to accuse people who have been **cleared of any guilt** of rape.

I don't see Coutinho beating Sterling or Ibe in a 100m sprint but he fits like a glove because of his passing ability and work rate. I'd say pace is always an asset, but if they take it away from you by sitting deep you need other skills to rely upon. Passing range and movement off the ball are two other things highly valued by Rodgers. 

As for Lambert: I'd point to the Aston Villa team of a few years ago as a tactical option that Lambert should be interested in. John Carew with Ashley Young and Gabby Agbonlahor were a fearsome counter attacking side. At 1.95m, Carew was certainly a force in the air but the thing is he was still mobile. He would essentially hold the ball a few seconds from a long ball and then deliver it to one of the wingers busting a lung to get forward. Or he would spot a run and play them in with a flick on. I believe that a system could have worked out with a pseudo target man but Rodgers didn't fully get the winger support needed to get it going. This will change will undoubtedly harm the press but then perhaps there needs to be a change of pace there. It would likely involve the midfield 3 sitting a little deeper. 

In football a well organized defense can always force a draw. Against a parked bus, there's one thing that can consistently help and that is quality set piece delivery. Another thing that can help is the presence of good long shots forcing them to close down players or face a strong shot on goal. Unfortunately Gerrard leaving exacerbates this problem.

Rodgers is a manager who will have a very successful career with a certain club, I'm sure of that. He showed last season that he has the ability to get the most out of his players and I fully expect his tactical naivety to improve as he gets further into his career. The problem I have is whether I can see him having that success with this club, with this set of players -- he is clearly a manager who wants to get his own targets, and I just don't believe FSG will ever allow him to be *that* manager unless we win trophies or challenge for titles. Someone like Klopp might be different; he may be allowed leeway because players want to play under him, and he has much more presence in the transfer market than the relatively inexperienced Rodgers.

  In response to all of your other criticisms, it should be worth pointing out that Markovic has barely played a full 90 minutes at once, rarely 75. When he has been played in his preferred position and has had minutes, he's done well. 

  I'm honestly flabbergasted when people say he doesn't have huge potential. It's honestly as if they've never watched young attacking players before. Not everyone is Messi or even Sterling. Most players are nowhere near the finished article before they are 23. Markovic is streets ahead of most players his age, and that's why we should keep him and develop him.

Stop putting words in your mouth? You clearly wrote that one of the reasons Scholes is a better player is because he has more awards to show for his performance. Champions League is an award, and the best award you can win as a club player. Thereby, the likes of Buffon and Nedved can't be the best at their roles, considering they haven't won the best award as a club player. I'm applying the same logic as you. I worded my comment in a hurry before, but you can see that this logic is flawed right? You can't go off of awards to base your opinions on a player, do you not know how ignorant that is? A persons performance can't be determined by a fucking award. Chelsea's Ryan Bertrand has one appearance in the champions league and has already won the champions league. Does that automatically make him better then other left backs in the world? Of course not, because that would be retarded. You have to take into account so many other fucking factors, you can't just look at one stat, that's why I said your statement is ignorant.

Isn't it strange people complain still about the Labour government and its over spending and borrowing, and now the Tories are talking about not overspending people get into a panic, one that may force the police to become a paramilitary force, in 21st century Britain.  


I wonder if eventually people will now realise the huge financial pressures Labour faced when in government, compounded by the banking and sub-prime mortgage crisis which started in the US.   It takes a lot of money to fund organisations like the police and the NHS both to meet public (read: the elderly) satisfaction, and to stop nurses and coppers pissing and moaning about how little 22grand to 32grand a year is, whilst arresting or treating people on a fraction of that.


You can actually do a lot of policing before moving to extreme tactics in my opinion on less money.

&gt;In the 1960s, controversial [Burnley F.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley_F.C.) Chairman [Bob Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lord_(football_chairman\)) successfully convinced fellow [Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League) Chairmen that televised matches on a Saturday afternoon would have a negative effect on the attendances of other football league games that were not being televised and as a result reduce their financial income.

&gt;As a result, [The FA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_FA), [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) and [Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League) do not want English matches to be televised live between 2:45pm and 5:15pm on a Saturday within the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom). Until recently, the FA Cup Final was an exception and had been broadcast at 3pm on a Saturday in May; however, in 2012, the FA Cup Final was moved to 5pm.

&gt;In February 2011, [Advocate General Kokott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliane_Kokott) of the [European Court of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice) opined that the ""closed periods"" did not encourage match attendance at other league games.

Did you watch the game? They were obviously trying. Palace is no slouch and we are no top dog. We had Gerrard on the field FFS. Every game he plays this season has us looking 2 steps slower. 


Anyone can make valid points about Rodgers being a bad manager, because its true, we could do better and he's still very young and naive. He still hasn't been able to find a style that suits the team or get the players to play how he wants. But you aren't helping yourself when you say that he is worse than Hodgson and has ""damaged the club"". You just lose all your credibility there. Rodgers has us playing MUCH better football than Hodgson and has signed FAR better players. Hodgson was the worst thing to happen to the club and was a sign of our ALL TIME LOW. any fan who knows football should be able to recognize this. 

Rodgers isn't amazing, but he definitely isn't shit. He's done BETTER than I expected this season. With suarez leaving, you'd be fucking retarded to think we could achieve top 4. 5th place was my prediction: I TOLD YOU SO. We actually did quite well considering the fact that we also lost our only other real striker, one of the strikers that was fundamental to our success last season. You sound like the type of fan that expected us to win the league just because we got 2nd last season.

Short term solution, stop showering. Strip wash instead so you are clean but not being soaked by the water. If you wash your hair upside down then you know nothing from that is touching your body, don't assume rinsing removes it especially if your water pressure is crap. Generally limbs don't need frequent washing like certain potentially smelly body parts do, and it can damage the skin.

Cold compresses can temporarily relive itching: basically the nerves can only send ONE signal at a time to your brain (hot, cold, itch, pain). As you already are do not scratch, that releases histamine which may worsen it.

Antihistamines need to be taken regularly for best effect not as a one off, obviously consult a pharmacist before adding that.

Review your diet and lifestyle choices, ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations. Likely not the cause but may be a partial treatment by strengthening your skin barrier, calming inappropriate immune response, reducing inflammation.

Whereas we make willian hazard and remy/costa/drogba be our first line of defence. if we hadnt had a stellar keeper we wud had conceded so much more. i have so much more shit to say but then i realised you're just a delusional fan. we dont match up with bayern, madrid, barca at all. we havent proved anything this season esp against

It's from 2012, but it looks like David Cameron is intent on pushing ahead with boundry changes in this next parliament, so it's going to be fairly relevant soon.

So I think we get another draft by 2018, and the boundaries in place for 2020.

The main changes I can see are:

Belfast South Abolished, and split between Belfast West (now Belfast SouthWest) and Belfast East (Now Belfast SouthEast). Dundonald is moved out of Belfast East. SDLP lose a seat, SF probably keep SW, SE is a mixed bag, but I think it might benefit Alliance slightly.

Shankill Road area shifts to Belfast North. Makes it more of a safe bet for DUP.

FFP at least keeps things solvent and sustainable. Otherwise we just keep piling Man Citys and Chelseas on top of each other until any club without a sugar daddy owner basically has no hope of competing with anything. And if all the top clubs are running massive losses each year, then all the top clubs basically only have the attention span and generosity of their owners between them and complete collapse. 

FFP definitely isn't the best answer and has its own flaws, but at least it's brought some relative stability. Who knows, over time maybe more efficient clubs can slowly claw back ground and overthrow bigger spenders.

""The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that the UK’s total expenditure on healthcare in 2012 was £144.5bn (€175bn; $245bn), 9.2% of GDP.1

The largest portion of this (£121.3bn or 7.7% of GDP) came from the public purse. The remaining £23.2bn was from private sources, including individual spending on healthcare, private health insurance, and private sector capital.

As a proportion of GDP, healthcare spending was 17.7% in the United States, 11.6% in France, 11.3% in Germany, 11.2% in Canada, 9.6% in Japan, and around 9.2% in Italy.""

Apart from that, Rudd and the Tories have the right idea, and I say that as a former (for reasons I hope are evident below) Scottish Green Party member.

Methane leaks from fracking should actually be minimize-able with oversight, and are its only real climate down-side.  The scare campaign does have the excellent side effect of ensuring this.  Intermittent renewables are crap; at a 20-35% capacity factor you end up with the remainder of the energy coming from gas or coal  anyway, so investing in cheap gas generators to replace coal is actually a better use of the capital than wind -  as a stop-gap pending advances and investment in nuclear.  Energy security and equity with increasing demand for gas, without fracking just isn't realistic.  The real litmus test however will be whether or not the ""dash for gas"" will close Drax  with its insane, ecocidal biomass fuel sourced from Florida.  I'm sceptical.

Offshore wind is a Tory diversion tactic.  It's more expensive than nuclear, and they won't subsidize it.

No, that's not why I'm saying at all. I'm saying by all means look to change voting reform for future elections, just don't do it on the premise that the recent one was somehow unfair and that the current Government is illegitimate.  

The whole point about bringing up Labour benefiting more from FPTP in the election they won is that is shows this means more to you than whether the left or the right wing is the winner. You can't campaign for electoral reform based on an election that happened two weeks ago with no research about anything else and expect to be taken seriously, even if you were young when Labour got in.

Good to see Costa playing again, and I've been saying for a while I think he'd play well along side Remy.

RLC seemed to have a good game bar the slips at the start, as did Remy. Costa not getting involved other than to cause drama not surprising me there, probably sluggish from his injury or still injured.

Claimants had to go straight to the central court in Strasbourg. HRA was introduced in 1998 to allow UK courts to make decisions on the ECHR, cases only go to Strasbourg as a last appeal.

If the HRA was replaced with something that tried to make the UK courts or Parliament the final arbiter, it would be in breach of the ECHR which is clear that the central court has the last word (a position I fully support). Although the Council of Europe (which is the body behind the ECHR) is totally separate from the EU being signed up is a requirement of being in the EU. Therefore, we either have to leave the EU or the replacement HRA will be really the same thing but different enough to trick the public into thinking change has happened. Given the Government wants to move quickly on the HRA (quicker than any EU changes) I expect the latter will happen.

It's easy to mount on a helmet, spare batteries are cheap, it can run off USB power, waterproof out of the box, good video quality, video tagging (great if you only want to record certain things after they've happened), and loads more.

I've not used an SJ4000 but the video quality isn't too bad from what I've seen and a friend of mine really likes his - and at that price it seems like you get a lot for your money.

If you can stretch your budget a tiny bit I'd say go for a Drift HD Ghost (£150 for a refurb on eBay), if not then an SJ4000 is a very good option for the price.

So far the party appears to view it as needing supply side reform less rules to fix problems and leaving it up to the market to fix any problems. 

Conservative-style policy for dealing with Housing crisis, remove the green belt reduce planning laws but strong focus on social housing being cheaper and private.  Move towards housing associations being the main supply of social housing no rents, public money goes to help fund the cost of keep up.  Green areas are added into the planning mix with builders working along side public funding to provide business zones and schools.  Builders don't have the funds they can go to investment fund to get the cash to build. 

Inequality would be redistribute and correct the problem at birth.  That means creating a tax system which is efficient at collecting taxes and coming up with a series of policy which reduces overall inequality at birth.  VAT changes in which pretty much everything is subject to VAT at 15%. 

Workers as a group are given a share within a company as a right and have a seat on the board.  Also bring forward plans for a higher minimum and ask trade unions to do their job.  

Education you want workers to join training programs and companies to invest, so you link up with public colleges/uni to provide courses.  Companies get a major discount with extra public funding during recessions. 

Some of these policies ideas come from Scandinavia, Germany and any other more equal nations.   Business taxes I would go with SMB 25% and bigger ones 35%. 

Most markets are monopolies and not even markets with prices already confirmed.

Kane needs to be rotated so he can rest.   Another striker is needed so we can have more flexibility with formation.   Finally, another reliable striker could create some competition which helps everyone improve.

* CB

A CB with pace who can compete with and rotate with Jan, Fazio, and Dier.   Form can dictate who starts week-to-week.

* CDM / CM

I'm not sold on playing a true destroyer, but, at minimum, we need a defensive minded player who can cover for CBs when out of position and play box-to-box when more men are needed forward.   Poch doesn't fancy Capoue or Stambouli and I don't think Mason, Bentaleb, Dembele have the physical stature and/or discipline needed to play such a role.

I wouldn't lose, I have pupils that would give evidence in court, I have an ex teacher that would also.

The only reason I was allowed on my College course was due to my problems, they essentially put me on a course I wasn't qualified for, I needed 4 GCSEs above a C, I left with 1 C. My parents did approach a lawyer at the time, but..

..they were told to stop, essentially told by the authorities that they'd sort out what happened.

Money would help significantly, it would give me monetary freedom, seeing the funds paid out to pupils around the UK, if I had known about the Limitations Act, and I did go to court, seven figures wouldn't have surprised me.

Therapist wise, it's a possibility, I have thought about it, if I go down the route of writing about what I went through, then I'd probably do it.

Boyata and Denayer could be very useful to us. Surely, they would take some time to adjust. But so has Mangala, and at a hefty price tag. 

I'm not going as far to say Mangala is worthless shit, but we spent money in a pinch, when we probably didn't have to. 

If we are going to buy any defensive player I think Danny Rose is worth a look. 

He is a good young LB. Boyata can play RB. Denayer in the center.

With Kompany, Mangala, Demi, and Zab likely to stay around. That is a pretty good rotation.
