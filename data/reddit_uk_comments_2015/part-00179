Wiki definition:

&gt; Tokenism is the policy and practice of making a perfunctory gesture towards the inclusion of members of minority groups.[1][2][3] The effort of including a token employee to a workforce usually is intended to create the appearance of social inclusiveness and diversity (racial, religious, sexual, etc.), and so deflect accusations of social discrimination.[3] Typical examples of tokenism are purposely hiring a black man or woman in an occupation usually dominated by white people, or hiring a woman in a profession usually dominated by men.",null,0,null,1431464376,null,0,false,0,cr70be8,null,t3_35pykw,null,t1_cr70be8,null,t1_cr6xxpx,null,null,null,1433026928,null,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10,null

Therefore nationality is entirely irrelevant to what human rights someone has. It is purely the location of the person that dictates what rights they have. Am I making a mistake here?

If we agree on these three things, then can we not agree that the principle of having a different set of human rights while in different parts of the same country is not (at least logically) contradictory?

If anything, I think a problem we currently have is having *too many* talented prospects.  If Lallana is on, Markovic and Ibe likely aren't getting enough minutes.  The emergence of Ojo and the return of Origi will only compound what is in reality a good problem to have.  If we bring in a right back and return to a back 4, Can is likely to miss out because of Rodgers' affinity for Allen.

null,false,FlappyBored,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"&gt; We do not keep our human rights when go to another country, currently. I think we can agree on that.

Because when you go to another country they are *ANOTHER GOVERNMENT* not your own. I do not have the same rights as a Thai person in Thailand because I am NOT A THAI CITIZEN. This clearly doesn't apply when I go to Scotland because I'm a UK CITIZEN and Scottish law is bound to respect human rights that are given to UK CITIZENS, NOT just UK citizens that live in Scotland, Scotland MUST give the same rights to an English or Welsh person the same as a Scottish person because they are all UK CITIZENS, they are not different.

&gt;As a result, I think it is fair to say that being of a certain nationality does not grant some set of human rights, regardless of your location. Do you agree with this statement?

No I disagree, as a UK citizen I am afforded certain rights from the UK government which other nationalities are not. For example, the right to vote. 


&gt; Could you maybe give me an example to help me understand?

Yes, legal system in the UK: 
Afford certain human rights to UK citizens.

Applies those rights to UK citizens.

All UK citizens are afforded THE SAME AND EQUAL RIGHTS. They are not separate. 

If the law is codified to apply the law EQUALLY TO ALL UK CITIZENS. Then you cannot apply the same laws to the SAME CITIZENS if they have DIFFERENT RIGHTS. You need separate citizenships to have separate rights. 


You need a separate legal system because a single legal system cannot treat the same citizens as different citizens with different rights because they are the same citizens with the same rights. There is no legal framework to differentiate between a Scottish person and an English person because you do not enter the legal system as a Scottish person or an English person but as a UK citizen who must be afforded the rights of a UK citizen.

Hey,

Thanks for taking the time to reply to my post - much appreciated.

Im going through my products at the moment to see if anything has changed in the ingredients that match the stuff that you have mentioned. its funny because my routine hasnt really changed over the past few months (since my last post) and the bumps defintely were not there. The dark skin has been i will admit been with me for quite some time due to the eczema and im fed up of looking purpley haha!

I have some aquadrate that i shall begin using again as it has helped with dryness in the past - it is 10% and i will be patch testing again but would you say that this should be fine all over the body?

I have stopped use of the aha for the time being to see any differences and will be continuing with the regime i have following otherwise.

I have been looking into niacinimide etc do you think that this may be beneficial? im currently looking to the benton snail bee range.

With regards to diet - i tend to follow a quasi paleo diet that generally meets my mirco and macro nutrients. The nutribullet helps with the veggies and fruits i must admit.

Any chance you know of any good dietary allergy tests or companies to look at? My GP doesnt seem to think i have any allergies and wont order the test as ""we would have noticed when you were a child"" which i think is rubbish personally as i know i have some issues with apple skins making my gums and mouth all tingly (could be a sign of PFS?)

You have to realise every negotiator (estate agent that is dealing with you) is working for commission. The basic pay is not much better than minimum wage and some issues arise out of this.

There are a lot of time wasters. So many people that want to view properties without the intention of buying. This can be anything from 20 minutes out of your day, to 45 minutes of your day. If the agent doesn't know you personally, they can't be sure how serious you are. They don't want to waste time on people that aren't getting them paid. 

Negotiators have individual commission. And agents split the applicants (people looking) between themselves. The whole branch won't work for you. So if you are dealing with a particular agent in your property search. Lets say it's Bob. You phone Bob to see if anything new is on, but say speak to Sue, it's not in Sue's interest to help you. It can be really cut throat between colleagues, and it is not uncommon for messages to not be passed over. They are competing against each other. If you end up buying a house with them via Bob, Sue is potentially losing out of a property to sell to one of her applicants.

When you call a branch, you don't always connect. Most nationwide estate agents have call centres nowadays.

Unfortunately this is how our society functions. Remember Gordon Brown? That is what you get when a PR guy goes against a man who sounds more like a lecturer. People were pissed off at the Banking crisis and the recession but he couldn't get his point across.

There was a moment when he and Darling actually came up with measures that saved the banks and was copied by countries across Europe and North America. Including Germany and the US. He was internationally congratulated. What happens in the UK? He accidentally says ""saved the **world**"" instead of **banks. Cameron makes a joke about superman and Brown looks like a fool.

Brown had no chance of ever beating Cameron. The Tories learnt their lesson in 2005. When Phony Tony got people to vote for him. Even an Iraqi acquaintance that despises him ended up voting for Labour. After that the Tories choose Cameron over the likes of much respected men such as Ken Clarke.

&gt;What, you mean your household doesn't pay debts in a currency it prints itself?

Now you say this:
&gt;I still never said anything about inflating government debts away.

Then you say this:

&gt;Inflation is essentially a national paycut and sometimes that is exactly what is needed. Like if Spain had its own currency in 2008 they could've inflated the pesata, giving everyone a pay cut reflecting the fact that they were a poorer country. And it would've reduced in real terms all the private debt that was crushing demand. That all makes sense. (instead of course Spain is having years of crushing recession being stuck on the Euro managed as if it's the Deutschmark.)

Which is exactly inflating debts away. 

I think you need to be clearer about what you mean. I'll be clear about what I mean-&gt; inflating debts away means either for the CB to print money and give it to the government (monetary financing of debt); or for the CB to print money so that the inflation rate increases and the real value of debts falls. Both are inflating away debts.

On the country like a household point. I think you are taking it a bit too far. What I mean when I say that a country's budget is like a households budget is that when income (tax) is larger than expenditure (welfare, defense ect) then the the country has to borrow, and pay interest on its borrowing (which reduces current consumption).

&gt;You still haven't showed how a nation can't maintain deficits indefinitely

I think we need to tighten up the language now, I've been at pains to be very clear on this earlier in the conversation: Countries can maintain (small) deficits indefinitely, but they cant maintain ever increasing debt (as a % of GDP) because the debt burden will become unsustainable (working under the assumption that the CB doesn't inflate away the debt).",null,0,null,1431466362,null,0,false,0,cr71lg8,null,t3_34twfk,null,t1_cr71lg8,null,t1_cr4ijeu,null,null,null,1433027530,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Personally, I'd call myself a Social Democrat. Sadly that leaves me left being caricatured as wanting to return to the seventies, when in reality, I feel that there better solutions out there. Energy and rail company ownership similar to that in France, union representation like in Germany, and a living wage to stop the state funding poverty wages.

Frankly, I wish there were a political party putting forward such ideas, as I feel it could bridge the gap in the left between ""North-London Geeks"" such as myself and the northern workers of this country who have been shat on since the eighties.

I'm not sure I agree with this sentiment. Labour was tarnished in the Scottish Independence referendum by being seen as ""with the Tories"" while other left wing parties were on the other side. This time, on the ""in"" side will be Labour, the SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and ""some of the Tories"". That's a wholly different situation.

null,false,eean,null,null,null,"As I already explained, the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England buying some bonds (which btw: they do all the time) is not the same thing as inflation. Inflation is *not* printing money. Inflation is when everything becomes more expensive.  Sometimes one leads to the other but not always. Why is that hard?

&gt; Which is exactly inflating debts away. 

Yes the example I gave is inflating debts away - private debts. You kept talking about inflating debts away so I gave an example of where that would've actually made sense. If you want to give a whole country a 10% paycut - and you actually do sometimes - inflation is about the only tool for the job. (Well the other tool is to have years of crushing unemployment and eventually people get paid less, thanks ECB for reminding us).

&gt; On the country like a household point. I think you are taking it a bit too far. What I mean when I say that a country's budget is like a households budget is that when income (tax) is larger than expenditure (welfare, defense ect) then the the country has to borrow, and pay interest on its borrowing (which reduces current consumption).

I mean yes, they are both broadly 'budgets'. 

After the end of WW2, which was worse: the huge debts or the fact that half the country was blown up? For an individual huge debts are enough to be financially crippling. An individual might rather their house burn down (insurance claim!) then be repossessed by the bank. I already mentioned how a country mostly trades with itself and owes itself most of its debt. There are just so many ways the priorities and financial realities for a country are different than an individual. 

The biggest reason countries shouldn't just drive up their deficit is because then private enterprise would have trouble finding people to loan them money. Everyone would rather loan to the owner-of-the-currency. How does that work with the household analogy? I mean the household analogy is supposed to be about why governments should run low deficits (if not even balanced budgets!) and it doesn't even touch on the main reason of why they should.",null,0,null,1431467742,null,0,1431468230,0,cr72god,null,t3_34twfk,null,t1_cr72god,null,t1_cr71lg8,null,null,null,1433027939,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The logic is that it's theirs (the supermarket) to throw away.

I completely agree that it's disgusting the amount of food that gets thrown away; the food waste bill from just my department at my supermarket this evening alone could feed a family for half a week. But the problem is that if we give this out of date food away, then we (supermarkets) open ourselves to liability. 

All of my food waste gets put in plastic trays in our backroom chiller. All it would take is one product that has been out of the cold chain for *far* too long to be put back into my waste without the barcode scribbled out (shorthand for 'it's been out of the cold chain') and then given to a homeless shelter or a soup kitchen, and we've just given some poor sod/s food poisoning.

It's a shitty situation when I personally have to throw away a family of 5's shopping every single week, but it's also a shitty situation that we *can't* give people free food because the risk of being sued as a get rich quick plan.

It's still not a given to win it. Hence the years they have failed to win it in the last ten years.

Why don't you then? Presumably you must be getting some other type of benefit beyond the basic salary to remain there.

If you and your colleagues simply move to the private sector then the public sector wages will have to rise to compete for candidates. Then your unequal pay problem is solved.

As for jobs on railways, what they are called, entail or are paid is completely irrelevant to my argument. 

If they don't like the pay in their industry then they should get a different job elsewhere! This is how it works for other people, they aren't some special case that deserves additional benefits.

If they can't live a decent life on that pay grade then why should anyone else have to either? They should fight for a higher minimum wage.

We can't just all move to the private sector. It would depress wages if even some of us moved, because the private sector won't get more customers just because there's more staff. Fairly basic economics...

null,false,JustAhobbyish,,Labour Member,null,"UKIP founder has been pretty vocal on what he wanted his party to be and what it became.  Claimed many times that the party never had xenophobia at the core [Linked one not long ago from him let me know if you want me to share it] . UKIP public perception is goes against political correctness of modern times party does not promote xenophobia per say but hints at it. UKIP uses xenophobia as a way to make the party unique and get people thinking they are speaking for normal people. Peel back the message you get xenophobia playing to peoples fears and fear over austerity.
Question is has UKIP been able to connect to people like SNP have at a local level , SNP may be a short term thing unless it has made connections.  Something else to take into account is the idea of independance is easy to sale to most people everybody wants to be independance. 

Why has xenophobia message been a success?
Answer is quite simple most people have quite a bit of misinformation when it comes to the EU and don't understand the EU.   Speaking to my Dad he could not tell me institutions the EU had and the power they had.  He wants to leave the EU...but can't tell me why or what wrong with the EU. 

Labour attitude towards the EU referendum was the right choice. When you talk to most voters EU not even in the top 20 issues on their mind so the strategy was sound.   Would have made no difference when it came to UKIP Labour voters who feel like they are left behind and UKIP listens to them.  Labour would been able to flank Tories on the issue but would been short term impact with no gain. 

My view on the European Union needs serious reform and we should be part of the European Union.  European Union can be undemocratic but so can the UK only 25% of people voted for the Tory party but they have the most seats.  House of lords has a major impact on laws of the land but nobody voted for them. 
Lost of some control is worth it for influence we gain. 
UK was able to become so powerful due to keeping it own influence high this has required us working together with other nations.  British empire was able to keep it own influence by a series of global institutions.  America created it own institutions after WW2 which allowed it influence to spread around the world allowing the nation to become the most powerful in the world.   2 billion people between two nations in the world both are lacking influence but when it time comes they are likely to build their own influence and institutions.  
UK runs a risk real of being a loser in the new global order when it decides to avoid pooling influence together with like minded nations. 

I would like to see European union federal state or federal European union.
European commision should be a institution with little power, MEPs and european parliament should have overall control.  Eurozone should have it own set of institutions to overseer the block and everybody else should share the same institutions.  Would like to see laws standardised and trade standards. Institutions across states should have the same powers and work with each other. Refining the current setup so it becomes a trade block with strong institutions and eurozone institutions given more power. 
My vision everybody who has a trade deal with the EU gets a seat at the EU trade institution, so Norway gets a say in any changes which impact trade to them.  

Anything which the institutions do should be open and when it comes to trade deals that does mean being open at every stage. ",null,0,null,1431470780,null,0,false,0,cr748zh,null,t3_35pwqw,null,t1_cr748zh,null,t1_cr6rulq,null,null,null,1433028782,null,1,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

&gt;Westminster could, as a matter of law, enact a new UK-wide Bill of Rights to replace the HRA. Again, however, it might face problems in doing so. First, since a new Bill of Rights would presumably, like the HRA, apply to both reserved and devolved matters, this would also trigger the Sewel Convention.

http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2014/10/02/will-devolution-scupper-conservative-plans-for-a-british-bill-of-rights/

&gt;The existence of this ‘devolution dimension’ imposes some constraints on the freedom of the Westminster Parliament to reconstruct UK human rights law as it sees fit. For example, any change to the current requirement that the Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh legislatures must comply with Convention rights would affect the scope of their devolved powers: as a result, under existing constitutional arrangements, it would appear to trigger the Sewel Convention, meaning that Westminster would ‘normally’ have to seek the consent of the devolved legislatures before it could legislate in respect of human rights law as it applies in respect of devolved matters. Furthermore, because the devolved legislatures are able to take steps to extend human rights protection, they have the power to minimise the impact of any reduction of rights protection brought about by Westminster legislation within the sphere of devolved functions.

&gt;Thus, for example, if the Westminster Parliament wished to root out the ECHR rights from UK law and replace them with home-grown ‘British’ variants through a new Bill of Rights, it would either have to leave intact the provisions of the devolution legislation that require the Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh legislatures to comply with Convention rights, or else seek the consent of the three legislatures to the removal from Convention rights from the devolution framework. 

http://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2013/03/04/colm-ocinneide-human-rights-devolution-and-the-constrained-authority-of-the-westminster-parliament/

&gt;Human rights and the Union

&gt;One exceptionally tricky aspect of repealing the Human Rights Act is the devolution angle: doing this would make life easier for Westminster and for English councils – but not for the Scottish Parliament, for instance, which would remain bound by the ECHR under the Scotland Act 1998. So when the Conservatives say

&gt;&gt;    We will work with the devolved administrations and legislatures as necessary to make sure there is an effective new settlement across the UK

&gt;what they mean is that these proposals potentially unravel another thread in the Union. If these proposals go forward, I imagine the Scottish government will seek the devolution of human rights policy so that it can stay loyal to the ECHR if it wants to – but on its own terms, not terms imposed on its by a UK government which itself rejects those terms.

Edit:

Also, It appears to Tories have already partially conceded the point.

&gt;    We, the academics of LSE, share in the critique of the UK higher education system that has been raised throughout the recent student occupation of the Vera Anstey Suite. We are concerned that universities are increasingly implementing the privatised, profit-driven, and bureaucratic ‘business model’ of higher education. Universities should be a space of critical thought where knowledge is prized for individual and societal growth, not primarily as a means towards economic growth.
 
&gt;The free and open expression of ideas is the foundation of a democratic society. The legal action taken against the students by the LSE management stands in direct conflict with the principles of free speech and right to peaceful protest.
 
&gt;We urge the management of LSE to reconsider this unreasonable decision.

Whether or not that involves a name change, focussing on the 'liberal' part of our identity (where we're the only game in town) makes it easier to do this than focussing on the 'social democratic' part (where we're in crowded competition with Labour and the Greens).

To be clear, this is as much a question of branding as of political positioning. Regardless of what we're called, it's obvious that a Farron-led 'Liberals' will naturally be more of a centre-left proposition than the Lib Dems have been at any point since Charles Kennedy. But the message that ""*we're a liberal party, who also dabble in some centre-leftism*"" is a much clearer one than ""*we're a social democratic party, who also dabble a bit in civil liberties and political reform*"".

Two other thoughts:

- My mum is in her late 50s and often still fondly refers to the party as 'the Liberals', as my grandpa also used to. I wonder to what extent the Liberal brand resonates a little better with the older generations who are, of course, the most likely to vote.

- The 'Conservative and Unionist Party' is today referred to almost exclusively as either the 'Conservative Party' (which hasn't been its name since 1912) or the 'Tories' (which hasn't been its name since 1834).

NONE of these rights are going to be stripped from anyone in the United Kingdom. This article, whether deliberately or not, ignores the fact that the Conservatives are planning to implement a replacement act in the form of a British Bill of Rights. 

While this Bill is yet to be published (or even finalised), it must be said that it would be 100% likely to include all of the rights that are ""due to be stripped"", and legally, there is no way that the UK can change this, as we are a signatory to the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) and are bound by the articles found within that. 

The Human Rights Act essentially does nothing but implement the articles of the European Convention on Human Rights, into UK Law. But we must remember that while these rights were  implemented, it is not like the UK was without them before.

Torture, Murder etc were not legal here before the Human Rights Act and would not becomes legal as a result of the act being abolished. 


Personally, I don't like the idea of abolishing the Human Rights Act, I feel that it does its job perfectly well, and replacing it with a new Bill will only serve to confuse matters, or could even result in some subtle ways for the government to infringe on our rights as citizens, depending on the wording of the new act.

null,false,Mithious,null,null,null,"&gt; You specifically said ""these jobs pay too much""

I think you've misunderstood that comment somewhat. What I'm saying is that the wage for a job should be the minimum the company needs to pay to attract **and retain** enough candidates of sufficient quality to do the job they want.

That is how what a job is worth is calculated. Any link to the skills, responsibilties or hardships of the job are indirect relationships (they each affect the number of suitable candidates interested in the position, along with numerous other factors).

This means that **if** a group of workers are using strike action to keep wages artificially high when, **if** the wage was lower they would still have enough quality candidates wanting to do the work **then** they are being paid too much.

This argument has nothing specifically to do with railway jobs, it's just how jobs work in general.

Where did I say their jobs were well protected? No job should ever be well protected. A company should only employ the staff it actually needs, anyone else should be made redundant. If a company wants to avoid compulsory redundancies (e.g. to maintain moral) then that's up to them. 

Anyone made redundant should of course be well looked after by the state and get sufficent benefits for a good quality of life while they are helped to find a new job, with retraining provided free of charge if necessary. This is something our government is pretty terrible at and should be improved.

The entire progress of humanity is based on compulsory redundancies. Otherwise we'd all still be farmers! Each new technology helps us to do the same amount of work with fewer people so that they can then do something else instead increasing the overall wealth of the nation.

edit
&gt; We can't just all move to the private sector. It would depress wages if even some of us moved, because the private sector won't get more customers just because there's more staff. Fairly basic economics...

That is my entire point! If some of you move the private sector wage will decrease while the public sector wage will increase (assuming your jobs are worth the money) until there is equilibrium.",null,0,null,1431472370,null,0,1431472629,0,cr755rq,null,t3_35p4we,null,t1_cr755rq,null,t1_cr73q9a,null,null,null,1433029210,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

null,false,ctesibius,UnionFlag,Various Triumphs,null,"I'd suggest going up the west coast. Take the ferries to Arran then to the Kintyre peninsula, and ride up keeping as close to the coast as possible. Near the start, have a look at Dunadd  (a hill fort which was the ancient capital of the kingdom of Dalraida when the first Scots came over from Ireland) and the ancient sites around Kilmartin, then there's a good road up to Oban. Maybe take the ferry on to Mull, ride around there a bit and on to the Ardnamurchan peninsula via Tobermory and head towards the Ardnamurchan lighthouse (furthest west in mainland Britain). Now you have to chose whether to keep to the west and over to Skye, or head a long way inland. If you go by Skye, spend some time there then head up to Harris and Lewis. Have a look at at Dun Carloway broch - a broch is a peculiar prehistoric building. This one is still 25' high, even though it's old enough that we're not even sure which culture built it.


Now back to the mainland via Ullapool. This is a small town of about 2000 population - but given the emptiness of the area, it's one of the most important settlements and it's signposted from the other side of the country. As you head north from here, turn off the A835 to the west a few miles north of Ullapool down a long single-track road past mountains and lochs. There's a great campsite near Loch Garvie - half a mile of field, a small ablutions block, a very small number of other tents, and a view of purple mountains and dark sea. The beaches around here are very fine whitish sand.

Follow up the minor road to Lochinver. This is my favourite road - reedy lochans under the mountains, single track road, no traffic. Beautiful. Lochinver is a small fishing port, the sort of place where you can sit outside the pub and watch salmon jumping just off the shore or in the river mouth. 

I don't remember the coast road to the north of there, but I'd take it on principle. Eventually you end up at Durness, a village on the north coast which is as close as you can get to Cape Wrath by road. It's possible to take a foot ferry and a minibus to Cape Wrath, which is a lighthouse over some high cliffs at the NW corner of Scotland, but it will probably take a couple of hours there and back. Durness is a bit forgettable, and personally I prefer to stop at Tongue, a bit further to the east. The NW of Scotland is flat, fertile, and not very interesting, but on your way south you might call at the Grey Cairns of Camster. These are a couple of Neolithic tombs, set a couple of hundred yards away from a minor road in the middle of nowhere. You can enter them, but you have to crawl in on hands and knees down a narrow passage that gradually gets taller until you reach the central chamber. The first time you do it you are very conscious that   there's no-one else around, you are crawling in to the dark head first, and you can't turn around.

As proof that I am subject to confirmation bias about the political leaning of the BBC, you offer by way of persuading me the following:

1) ""Some studies"" that show the BBC has a right-wing bias. But no reference or link to these studies.

2) A link to an article in the Guardian by Owen Jones, well known for his impartiality in this arena. In this article he argues that the BBC has a right-wing bias. Among his points in favour are: 

(a) That one BBC Chairman was previously a Conservative minister.
(b) One Political Editor once headed the Young Conservatives.
(c) Two editors, a producer and a presenter have connections to the Conservative party.
(d) Another editor used to be journalist for a right of centre newspaper.

Considering quite how many people work there, [roughly 20,000 as of 2011](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/foi/classes/disclosure_logs/rfi20111450_number_of_bbc_employees.pdf), that's not very damning.

(e) John Humphreys made a programme about benefits that Owen Jones, considered ""extraordinarily biased"". He then conflates his feelings about this program and the way he perceives the BBC deals with the issue of benefit fraud with a study by IPSOS Mori that shows how ill informed the public is about the actual scale of benefit fraud. Not really evidence, more an inverted pyramid of wobbly emotive conflation.

(f) Three people who worked for the BBC went to work for either the Conservative Mayor of London or the Downing Street press office. I refer you again to [the number of people who work at the BBC.](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/foi/classes/disclosure_logs/rfi20111450_number_of_bbc_employees.pdf)

(g) A study by Dr Mike Berry (more of him later) at Cardiff University which purports to show that BBC has a right wing bias because the numbers of interviews of Gordon Brown, when he was Prime Minister, and David Cameron when he was leader of the opposition were off ""by a ratio of less than two to one (47 vs 26) in 2007"", which he then compares to the ratio between David Cameron as Prime Minister and Ed Milliband as leader of the opposition. This ratio *shows* Ed Milliband's interviews were outnumbered ""by a factor of nearly four to one (53 vs 15)."" Quite apart from the fact that 3.53 to one, is definitely NOT ""nearly"" four to one, Gordon Brown was a famously camera shy politician and Cameron the opposite. That sort of selective comparison is worthy only of a sixth form debate and not a serious academic.

This is the same Dr Berry who was panned by CIVITAS in a row about the [Prebble Report on the breadth of opinion at the BBC](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/breadth_opinion/breadth_opinion.pdf). He and other academics [""had seemingly isolated specific parts of the Prebble dataset data"" to ""reach wider conclusions about the BBC"" using ""inaccurate extrapolations from the data.""](http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/impartialityatthebbc.pdf)

The rest of his points aren't really that relevant, and assume the reader's agreement on the usual tropes that if you are right wing you must want to smash the NHS and hate Palestinians. 

I'm certainly not saying that individuals within the BBC are not guilty of right wing bias, I'm sure there are some. What I think is that the institution, as a whole, leans fairly clearly to the left. Not a great deal, but not centrist.

Referencing Owen Jones as an authority (I use the word in its academic sense) on this issue could indicate that you might be guilty yourself of a little confirmation bias too, no?

Edit: heres another article, although it is 2 years ago now, that states how much some of the executives are on. Would be interesting to see if they have had a pay rise over the past 2 years.

Its amazing how most of them are well over £500k a year, while their workforce are offered a 0% pay rise.

I know a 3 year window is not an ideal time frame to make a judgement, but is straining the team mid week for a mediocre amount of prize money worth the cost in places domestically, and risking loosing a champions league berth in 16/17 is the question I am raising. If Rodgers has the balls next year to play the youth team and the reserves in Europa with a few starters I would be more than happy, but it pissed me off to no end this season when he fielded a strong team on Thursday night against Beshiktas, going into extra time and penalties only to loose, to then turn around and play a major game against Man City on a two full day turn around (even though we did get the win, it was still risky especially with our squads track record with injuries).

As if it's necessary, which it isn't, I must say I have huge grumbles and issues too.

The main complaint I have, and which most of the ones I read about here experience, is a lack of communication about why they heck a bus they have scheduled doesn't show up, which messes up beat laid plans and in my case entails a walk I to the city centre instead in sometimes less than ideal weather. 

They just need to invest in proper bus tracking systems like in London for example, ones which give a GPS read of the buses and let you know when to leave the house (or not). 

All this is available for a public and private company to get their hands on. 

(Haven't even touched on how shiny private services will just be a land grab for lucrative corridors and a skeleton public service, or non profit, will have to cater for the unprofitable but necessary services like IKEA exchange, Tesco, or hospital routes in the city, let alone smaller rural routes.

Also it's far too small a place for more than one company to work so there'll be a monopoly again anyway And with more than one comes the frustrations of different schedules, websites, tickets, prices, contactless cards, etc ... All conveniently forgotten (can something in the future be forgotten?!) in the face of a lot of vitriol for the current system. 

Again to lend some ""legitimacy"" to my views, I have issues with TransLink but friends firm abroad were impressed and last week I was startled to hear a pensioner talking to another pensioner, out for the day, and as the bus turned on to the Albertbridge road and Belfast city centre came into view they quietly said how good the bus service was. 

You're going to get these good, and bad, opinions under a private operator. Difference is at least, in principle, it's a bus service run for reasons other than sheer profit. 

It'd be worrying if there was a campaign within or without to potentially move to something a lot more profitable for a lot fewer people...",null,0,null,1431475556,null,0,false,0,cr7710j,null,t3_35pbnr,null,t1_cr7710j,null,t1_cr73c17,null,null,null,1433030090,null,4,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,4,null

1 starting Striker: Someone with energy and pace. Ideally entering his prime or in his prime. MOst importantly willing/able to learn because BR likes having players play in a certain way. Dunno who though. Aubameyang seems out of reach probably. There's this guy Luiz Adriano we've been linked with who has good stats and kinda fits the mold apparently. I don't know anything else about him though

1 starting right back: Pls just a safe and solid player. We need to stop taking risks. And we need somone to basically walk right into the side. People keep saying Janmat but that guy will surely be really expensive

1 starting defensive mid: I think Lucas might leave. If he does, we need another player to walk into the team. Who do you guys think? I have no idea, surely not Schneiderlin though. If Lucas stays, maybe a young player to take over for him in a year or two (Maybe Can can be that guy?)

1 Back up keeper: maybe a younger type guy to take over from Migs eventually

I'd be happy with just those 4 honestly. I hope we don't have to integrate a bunch of players into the side again.
If you think we should get Ings or another CM or something, let me know. I'd be happy to discuss

The Europa league is very difficult to win towards the end, especially when coming up against the quality sides in Italy, Spain, and Germany who aren't in the champions league or who get dropped into it. Although the European experience for the players and Rodgers would definitely be nice and are needed, I think the burden of risking money from BPL places to do better in the Europa League in hopes of winning is a risky investment. Especially since the money is not as good (potentially a 5-6 million Euro difference between the 12/13 season to 13/14 or half the money from winning the Europa league if the rates remained the same from then, which they have probably gone up because of the new TV deals).

And that is what's very important. Most of the kids on these estates have moronic parents who don't give a shit and that means those kids are most likely going to end up the same way.

None of them truly want to live that way but at the same time they don't know what's out there. They've  probably never left the estate except to sign on. This is literally all they know. Cutting benefits and whatever might seem like the logical response to people who appear to be taking the piss out of  the system but it isn't going to help anyone.

And pretty much everyone, to be honest!

Edinburgh council WAS an SNP/Lib Dem administration.  Conservatives and Labour voted to terminate the tram at Haymarket (so it would run from a little west of the city centre to the airport), the least-cost way of finishing the damn thing.  Lib Dems voted to extend it to York Place (east end of city centre), SNP abstained.  Result, tram due to terminate at Haymarket.

Scottish Government then says well, if you do that, it's a material change, and you won't get the last tranche of cash from us (millions).

Council re-votes.  SNP councillors now support the York Place option rather than abstaining.  Tram goes ahead.  Nobody queries how terminating at York Place doesn't constitute a material change from terminating in Leith where it was supposed to finish in the first place...

As far as I know we don't actually have any parties which haven't been tarnished by their involvement with the tram.

Which is now costing the council £16,000 a *day* in interest payments.  If we're lucky, by the time it's all paid off, it'll have been a bit less than a billion pounds for an eight mile tram line.

Fucking incompetent isn't the word.

In the UK, being white places you in the majority and is a privileged class. But is that the same everywhere? Being white in 1980s South Africa would make you an ethnic minority, and so by her stated argument incapable of racism. I'm pretty sure apartheid was racist.

Just because she identifies as an ethnic minority, does that mean that everyone else identifies her as such? If everyone else sees her as white, then she benefits from that privilege even while denying its existence, which is exactly the kind of privilege-denial that she is complaining about others committing.

What if I identified as a racial minority? ""I'm not white, I'm native Cornish!"" Does that now free me from accusations of racism, even though nobody else treats me any differently?

And finally, on this dive down the Moebius rabbit hole, what if I said that blacks are horrible people? You don't know if I'm being racist until you know what race I am (as already noted). So I tell you that I am white. You **still** don't know if I'm being racist until you know whether that makes me a privileged majority. If I'm in Zimbabwe (which has had some major anti-white sentiments in the past 20 years) then it doesn't, and so I'm not racist. Hop on a plane to Britain (or step across the border to South Africa) and the same comments become racist. Fly (or step) back and I'm not racist any more.

As I said, the time bomb issue is healthcare &amp; pensions, these are the two spending areas that need looking at in the long term. Immigration isn't the only answer, there are a lot of ways to tackle it - later pensions, more automation, more family friendly welfare to promote childbirth &amp; raise fertility rates to name a few.

Guardiola in my opinion is over tactical and doesnt know how to get the best from his players especially defensively. While at barcelona he had a huge amount of success but the last two year at bayern we have seen a coach who cannot manage a solid defense against top teams and from the games ive seen when bayern goes down a goal it seems they have a difficult time recovering and fighting to get that the crucial goal back. 
IMO guardiola is highly overrated and has never proven himself at a club during a building stage (yes he help cultivate a great barca but it always felt more about the players than the coach) or even at a lower level club. Unless we start playing on field without goals and only possession matters Chelsea needs mourinho and so does football as a whole. 

On a seperate anti pep subject. IMO that barcelona team was the beginning of the end of appreciation for great defensive teams. Now teams would rather win 5-3 rather than 2-0 and have leaky defense. I just dont get it.

&gt; Politically, Blair has been identified with record investment into public services, an interventionist and Atlanticist foreign policy, support for stronger law enforcement powers, a large focus on surveillance as a means to address terrorism and a large focus on education as a means to encourage social mobility. In the early years (circa 1994–1997), Blairism was also associated with support for European integration and particularly British participation in the European single currency, though this waned after Labour took office.

I'm a bit of a Blairite myself (RIP karma); I favour more business-friendly policies, an end to austerity, and I'm pro-EU.

I don't think people want to get rid of Raheem Sterling because of his performance on the pitch. And anyone who actually thinks that the 20-year-old Sterling is not good is, well, an idiot. And anyone who expects much more from Sterling *right now* as a 20-year-old is also an idiot.

But here's the trouble:

* Sterling's current performance does not match the wages that he (and/or his representatives) is allegedly asking for.

Now, I am prone to the same frustrations and waver between ""Fuckin' pay the man"" and ""How dare he ask for such wages"" depending on how Sterling does week to week.

But to truly wrap my head around the issue, you have look at the pros and cons from both sides (i.e. the club vs. the player) as well as your general philosophy regarding how much you pay a professional footballer at the age of 20.

First off, let's just look at the basic facts about Raheem Sterling the player:

* He has played 2,957 minutes for us in the Premier League this season. Only Mignolet (3,045) and Henderson (3,076) have logged in more minutes.
* Sterling has 7 goals and 10 assists. He has the second highest number of goals on the squad and is tied with Henderson for the most number of assists.
* (And for the sake of simplifying the argument, let's ignore arguments about ""efficiency"" (i.e. goals scored/assists made per x-amount of minutes)).

These basic numbers (and, yes, I realise numbers aren't everything) show that Sterling is an integral part of the side. And I'd be hard-pressed to find other 20-year-old players with similar numbers.

Now with that information, let's look at both sides -- club vs. player -- and examine their respective arguments when it comes to these negotiations:

* The **player** will naturally -- and rightly -- argue that he is a first team regular, an integral part of the starting XI, a crucial part of the attack compared to the rest of the squad, that he is a sort of player that Liverpool simply cannot afford to lose.
* Meanwhile, the **club** will argue -- rightly -- that unfortunate circumstances (i.e. the departure of Suarez, the injury to Sturridge and others, the slow progress of new transfers) simply gave Sterling these numbers due to sheer volume of minutes.

Furthermore, from the **club's** perspective, you have to determine a sort of basic philosophy regarding talented young players like a 20-year-old Raheem Sterling:

* Do you set wages strictly on *past performance* and *previous experience*?
* Or do you set wages -- especially for a young player -- based on future hopes and expectations?

Stubbornly adhering to either philosophy has its dangers... Set wages on previous performance and then you might find yourself rewarding the glories of the past. Set wages on the future and then you gamble on constant forward progress.

Next, I look at the idea of leverage: Who has it? Who doesn't?

* **Sterling** and/or his representatives know that Liverpool FC have struggled to secure ""top"" players in the transfer window. Furthermore, to lose a young up-and-coming talent like LFC could be a PR nightmare and further reflect LFC as an undesirable destination for young players. This inability to secure proven replacements (the devil you don't know) for Sterling (the devil you know) coupled with the lack of Champions League play will encourage a player like Sterling to look elsewhere.
* The **club** on the other hand can argue that any club who has the money to pay Sterling, give him the hope of a title run and Champions League glory, will *not* have the room to give a bratty 20-year-old the chance to prove himself and play 3,000+ minutes over the course of a season.

So, the big picture question that we debate is clear: Take the money and rot on a bench in Madrid? Concede the money and be an integral part of a squad in Liverpool? Ply your trade in Spain? Or stay within the comforts of home in Liverpool/England?

Of course, those are the questions that we'd all like to know. Questions that Sterling have generally answered quite poorly.

But I can't blame him for that.

I ask every one of you, what is the biggest financial, life-changing decision that *you* had to make at 20-years-old?

The cold business of professional sport will eat you alive.

Clubs will try to fuck you and underpay you. ""Trusted"" agents will try to fuck you and squeeze money out of you so they can get a bigger payday.

Basically, everyone is trying to squeeze money out of you because you represent a cash register to the club and to the agent when all you want to do is just play football.

Interestingly, you can see that Brendan Rodgers' subtle comments about Sterling's representatives start to make more sense. (And it's moments like this where you see that Rodgers genuinely loves and cares for the game and his players). Rodgers sees these agents twisting Sterling's head around.

Meanwhile, you look at Jordon Ibe who still has his parents work through the contracts.

You almost start to see that Sterling's support structure is weaker than Ibe's support structure.

... so now what?

In other instances, you can read between the lines. You can see the clever leaks to the media and the coy comments. You can see the dance that's being played out.

With Sterling it's quite difficult because we truly don't know what Sterling really wants. And with pressure from the club and the pressure from his agent and now the pressure from the supporters, Sterling seems lost and unable to figure out who he wants to please.

And that's almost heartbreaking to me because Sterling just wants to play football and forget about the silly business of football. But like any kid his age, he wants money too. Who wouldn't? But he can't seem to decide and make a clear decision.

I think it's at moments like these where a coach like Brendan Rodgers will truly earn his wages. It's up to Rodgers to be completely upfront with Sterling about how he is perceived by the coaches and the club. It's up to Rodgers to be that father figure and guide Sterling to the best decision based on what Sterling *really* wants out of life and football.

And it's scary.

After all, what else could Raheem Sterling possibly do? He doesn't strike me as a man of many talents outside of football. His career could end with a single tackle at any given moment. And if that happens, his only relevance is life is sad stories about What Could Have Been.

So I don't blame him for wanting the money.

Hard decisions for a 20-year-old kid.

And anyone who reads all of this and thinks I'm full of shit, well, I'd argue that you are either a child or are ignorant to these sorts of complexities in life.

Now, if you've gotten this far, then maybe you'll ask me... well, if you're such a clever one, then what do **you** think will happen?

Here's what I think:

* Raheem Sterling will stay with Liverpool FC.
* Sterling won't get the wages he (or his representatives) want; The club won't get Sterling for as cheap as they want.
* I'd wager that it sets around £80k a week (with significant incentives).
* The supporters will crucify him and every performance next season will be scrutinised intensely.
* Sterling will have a poor 2015-16 season.
* Sterling will have a brilliant 2016-17 season.

In fact, that 2016-17 will be so brilliant that he'll want to renegotiate his contract and we'll go through this all over again. Lol.

But my hope is that Sterling will do a lot of growing up in that time and he will work hard and he will come good.

One issue the council have is the lack of exits in case of a stadium-wide emergency, and with the land around the Bridge being occupied - as well as the train line which runs close - it would be interesting to see how the planners were to go around the various issues to create an approved 60,000 seater.I would love to see us in a 60,000 seater stadium purely for the purposes of revenue and increased ticket availability, but if this comes at the cost of intimacy which is currently at the bridge I'm not so sure. If we were to effectively go back to sitting with a running track between us and the pitch (in terms of distance) the atmosphere would be a bit too Emirates-y for my liking.

You're generally right except for this bit (which is the conventional wisdom, so I'm in the minority here, and you have an excuse for being wrong!). The referendum exacerbated the SNP landslide, but it wasn't the cause of it. By 2011, the SNP surge had already nearly wiped out the Liberals and made huge inroads into Labour constituencies in the 2011 Holyrood election, before there really were 'Yes voters' (polls suggest support for independence was about 25-35% or so). 

Here's a map of what happened in [2011](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_general_election,_2011#/media/File:Scottish_Parliament_election_2011_map.svg), under the FPTP part of the Scottish parliament elections - it shows the SNP hitting 72% of the seats, on about 45% of the vote and would already have been a huge landslide were it translated into equivalent seats at Westminster, and this was before there was even a referendum to vote on; it was this SNP swing at Holyrood that allowed the referendum bill to pass.

I imagine that'll depend on the circumstances of the kid's parents. If their parents have a decent income, the kids will obviously be cushioned, if their parents are on the breadline, then it's presumably going to result in a drop in quality of life.

It's not a one-size-fits-all issue. It also depends on the nature of the disability. I know quite a few families with disabled kids, and some of them get by quite comfortably, despite severe disabilities. Others, not so much.

One of the proposals that will hit some f the less well off is that to withdraw carer's allowance. I know from personal experience that many parents of severely disabled kids end up having to give up their jobs, or at least go part-time, and it gives an indication of how tough things can be for some of these families when that £58 per week might make the difference between eating and heating.

Personally speaking, I'd rather see my tax money being spent on improving the quality of life of disabled kids than on doubling the subsidy awarded to owners of grouse shooting moorland.

However, you have over-simplified the argument by making it a Europa vs. Champions League discussion.

Now I'm a long-winded bastard and I love to hear myself talk and I was about to go on this long discussion about money... However, I'll keep it short. Haha.

The issue isn't about profits and losses on a year-to-year basis.

The insanely rich clubs like Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea, Real Madrid, etc. have skewed our perspective on what we need to accomplish financially. And because of that, the media, our rivals and even our own supporters will have you believe that we are a ""poor"" club.

In fact, this narrative that we are ""poor"" has us so turned around that we are trying to determine the cost/benefits of actual revenue between the Champions League vs. Europa League.

To over-simplify it myself, hell, that £300m kit deal with Warrior (now taken over by New Balance) alone will help cover any expenses incurred by our inclusion into that pesky Europa League competition.

So, yes, again, money **is** everything but to be concerned about the potential revenues of the Champions League vs. Europa League is a bit naive and, ultimately, silly.

Of course, it's no secret that the financial benefits of regular Champions League play is absolutely crucial for the success of a major football club and we *absolutely* need to get there and *stay* there for as long as possible (and, fuck, win a couple while we're it at, right?).

But to get there, to stay there, to succeed there, we need to establish the foundations of success. And it's an entire cycle:

* Europa League play gives everyone the necessary experience. And I mean *everyone* from the manager, the coaches, the players, the supporters who travel (they'll need to save their money knowing Liverpool will be in Europe regularly) down to the staff that arranges travel to Europe and get familiar with their counterparts in Europe.
* That experience will lead to a smoother experience when we get to the Champions League.
* Regular inclusion in the Champions League (a few seasons in a row) will lead to a new generation of footballers who see that Liverpool is back and a desirable destination.
* Which in-turn gives us an ability to sign these players at ""reasonable"" fees and wages, create the depth we need to compete across numerous competitions.
* Which in-turn increases the level of our brand as a club and secure even more lucrative deals with even bigger brands.
* Which in-turn will increase the number of fucking casuals and plastic supporters who will spend a fuck ton of money to support our club.
* Which will ultimately result in even *more* money for us to compete with the best of the best.
* Which will result in trophies, titles, respect/hatred, praise.

To split the hairs on revenue from Champions League vs. Europa League is narrow and short-sighted.

To conclude, let me expand on the old glass half-full/glass half-empty metaphor.

The glass itself (i.e. our brand, our influence, our history, our earning power, our potential) for Liverpool FC is massive. It's every bit as big as Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, Man City, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, etc.

However, for a variety of reasons (which I can write about some other time), our massive glass is with broken bottom and for too long every attempt to fill it up as leaked out the bottom.

Therefore, we need to rebuild the bottom of the glass, we need to rebuild the foundation with smart owners (FSG), a wide-eyed, stubborn but smart and passionate manager (Rodgers), a young and hungry squad (Henderson, Coutinho, Sterling, Ibe, et al), and gain the experience of Europe (starting with Europa League if need be).

And once we rebuild that bottom we can start filling that glass with money, hope, optimism, trophies, titles, success, glory.

Our history, our brand, our legends give us a smug sense of entitlement that draws the ire of our rivals but that entitlement is what holds us back.

We are a proud superpower licking our wounds in the corner. We are the British Empire coming to terms with the fact that there will be places in the world where the sun does set. We are the brash world-saving United States coming to grips with its weakening influence in global economics and politics.

Now the question is, will we stubbornly cling to the past or will we treasure the past as the past and push forward to re-invent ourselves. Are we The Rolling Stones? Or are we a David Bowie?

I'd like to think that a club like Liverpool FC can re-invent itself and return to glory. And I believe that we are making significant steps towards that glory in a new and modern way with deep respect for the past.

And when we do that? I'll be the first to gladly put two fingers up and say to everyone else, ""Fuck off; I told you so.""",null,0,null,1431503471,null,0,false,0,cr7jsvy,null,t3_35ra3q,null,t1_cr7jsvy,null,t3_35ra3q,null,null,null,1433036192,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

&gt;Largely the claims that ISDS is used to prevent governments enforcing regulation are unfounded, certainly some companies have made some (very costly) attempts to do this but they have failed miserably. ISDS is designed for cases where a government attempts to use legislation (or local courts) in order to preference domestic industry over international industry, regulation that applies to all industry equally (IE is not targeted) may be subject to dispute but the company bringing the dispute will not win.

&gt;Frivolous nonsense like the PM action against Australia is not a good argument for ending ISDS anymore then frivolous civil cases in the US are a good argument for reducing the accessibility of civil courts. Companies who have attempted such action via ISDS disputes in the past have failed and as the initiating corporation pays all arbitration costs for both sides if they can't make their case its an extremely costly mistake to try and use ISDS like this.

The granting of a ban, which would be subject to immediate review by the High Court, would make membership or funding of the organisation concerned a criminal offence.

So Theresa May could ban the Labour Party, and make membership of it a criminal offence, as long as she ""reasonably believes"" that it ""intends"" to call for people to demonstrate against repeal of the ban on hunting (since such demonstrations might well create a ""pressing"" need to protect the public from ""public disorder"").

The media and the government work in tandem to make a narrative that the majority of us will agree with, then bring in coded laws (coded in the sense they say one thing and mean the other, so when they say 'anti-extremism' we think 'anti-ISIS' but what they really mean is 'we want more data about everyone and we want you to accept it.')

I'd like to consider myself a bit of a writer and from that perspective, I like the way you showed how insignificant things are in the context of the universe, how silly and petty it is to waste so much time obsessing over the details of Sterling's contract, a loss, a win, a slip, a title, a goal or a missed penalty. But while you are quite self-aware of our fleeting existence, you come back and confidently state your admittedly futile and almost illogical love for a sport, for a club.

I like to joke that I can never trust a man or woman who completely dismisses the importance of sport. But I don't know if it's that much of a joke anymore. The devoted passion for sport is woven into the fabric of our culture, of *any* culture, so how could a politician, a religious leader, a community leader, truly be able to understand the needs of the public without knowing a seemingly silly but fundamental part of their culture?

&gt;In the words of the immortal Bill Shankly, a man who loved and lived red, ""Some people believe football is a matter of life and death, I am very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it is much, much more important than that.""

This oft-quoted statement by Shankly is often used as a banner for how football -- above all! -- is always more important than life, death, your friends, family, responsibilities as a human to your community, your country, your world.

But from my perspective, I don't think Shankly was attempting to say that football is the *only* thing in life. I think Shankly was disappointed at how lives were consumed only by the results of a football match, disappointed at how people obsessed over the details while missing the big picture.

I think Shankly was saying that our everyday life is unfair, unjust, unlucky and any ""law"" that supposedly protects its citizens sometimes do not apply to those with the most money, the most political power, the most public support.

But in football? In any sport? That is a small slice in our life where everything is *supposed* to be fair. It's 90 minutes where only performance on the pitch matters, not your class, not your education, not your money. It's 90 minutes at the pub where it doesn't matter if the person next to you is rich or poor. For 90 minutes everything is simplified into Us vs. Them. For 90 minutes, we can all set aside differences. This is why the World Cup is so beautiful, this is why football is beautiful, this is why sport is beautiful.

It really is much more than life and death.

Shankly got it right. And I think the OP put it quite nicely as well.

OP, if you're pursuing a career in writing, keep at it, keep working to sharpen your craft. And if you're not pursuing writing, well, hold on to the philosophy that you have shown here.

Right! My point is precisely a way to help people manage their diet. 

&gt;labelling them in such a way that the calories are visible from a distance is unfair 

I don't see how it's unfair. You just label what's in your product. In fact, it could actually help chocolate companies. Recently I stopped eating a yoghurt after dinner so often when I found my favorite chocolate bar was actually fewer calories. I had been cutting it out on the assumption it was very calorific. When people can easily see calories they can factor in chocolate without trouble.

null,false,citizen1862,null,null,null,"&gt; And the latter? Well sorry if I think that a government breaking a contract with a company is grounds for suing.

One of the problems is that this may in practice violate parliamentary sovereignty. If one government passed particular laws and granted particular contracts that a future government wanted to rescind, the future government may be barred on doing this because of the cost of doing so.

Another problem is that it doesn't just allow corporations to sue for losses due to government action, it allows them to sue for expected future losses. This means that payouts could be massive.

Thirdly, it may put governments off passing much-needed regulatory laws in areas that desperately need them (banking, fracking) as regulations would effect the profits of businesses operating in this area. This would severely harm any Government's ability to control corporations from acting irresponsibly.

Fourthly, it puts us in a position where a corporation can sue a state for loss of profit, but a state has no recourse to sue a corporation for economic loss. This is fundamentally unfair.

Finally, why should economic loss because of government policy be actionable? Enforcing it harms democracy, as a government voted for by the people could be constrained from acting as the people want it to do because it fears harming corporate profits. The clause isn't just for breach of contact, it's for state action that leads to economic loss. With breach of contract the offending party has committed a wrong, but to harm profits no wrong needs to have been committed.

Even when I was unemployed I smoked, and probably smoked more heavily during this period because of increased anxiety. If I tried to quit I'd get anxiety attacks.

People smoke for various reasons, and as nicotine is one of the most addictive substances its not hard to imagine why people start smoking or continue to smoke even if they are not employed.

Very rarely do people smoke because they see it as a luxuary. Most people smoke becuase once you are hooked, not smoking is dreadful. Literal nicotine dependancy.

If you smoke and suddenly find yourself with no job and no money, it doesn't make ot any easier to quit. It just makes you go to more extreme ends to get cigarettes/tobacco. I used to walk 2 miles to my local garage at 3am in the morning with a pocket full of coppers to buy fags. ""Just getting rid of my change"" was my most used phrase.

In politics, as in life, these things rarely have a straight forward answer.

One interpretation is that in light of the eurozone crisis of the last few years, staying out of the euro was a smart decision for the UK as it shielded us from the worst of the harm. On the other hand, if we had joined the euro the eurozone crisis would have been considerably less dire (our economy would have been a significant chunk of the whole economic zone), and as the eurozone crisis effected us in serious ways anyway, having been inside and preventing the crisis might have panned out better for our economy too.

I didn't vote Tory but I have to disagree with this. Help to Buy, alone, is a signal to those who believe in meritocracy, and while it is far from a perfect solution to an infuriating problem (which is, bluntly, a political disgrace and pox on all their houses), it offers a lifeline to people who want to have a go.

At present I have two options for buying a home: ask my parents for a lot of money, or use Help to Buy. Without Help to Buy, the only option available to me is money from my parents.

If it weren't for the Conservatives I would be forced into a position of using my 'background' to get the life I want. So on the one hand you've got the Tories making it possible to get ahead if you make the personal sacrifices and take the risk (and there is always risk in investment - any young people expecting a smooth ride onto the ladder are kidding themselves), and on the other you've got Labour who insist on rent controls which only make it easier to be poor. And people have the gall to suggest that the Tories are the party of class-based elitism? They're the only party that actually seem to care about weakening the barriers of entry into markets, or weakening the barriers of the social classes to make social mobility a possibility.

Which party do you think is going to catch the public's imagination, including (or especially) the young families, with no political allegiances, who want to get on the ladder; or the older families worried about what their teenagers face when, in a few years time, they're spat out into the cruel dog-eat-dog world of financial independence? Which party is the party of opportunity and ambition, and which one is the party of entrenching people in their class background for a turf war?

Labour offered sweet FA at the election for basically anyone. Just vapid promises that they were going to strengthen infrastructure and tax the rich. There was absolutely zero in their manifesto to suggest that they were serious about their stone-engraved pledge that they would build a society where the future generations can do better than the last. They tapped into the anger of people, but offered next to no constructive solutions. They were weak through and through.

And that's just one example. People rail on the Tories (and I will rail on some of their decisions over the next 5 years no doubt), but they actually seem committed to making a society wherein people can have a fair crack of the whip. At the last election Labour's message to me was nothing but, ""Get mad and vote for us.""

null,false,Taure,eng-Suffolk,Suffolk County,null,"This is of course good news, but it veils a serious issue that I think is going to become the central economic debate of the next decade, once austerity-mania dies down. That issue is productivity: the value the UK is able to extract from its land, labour and capital. Normally, productivity increases every year, meaning that the economy is able to produce more ""stuff"" with a set amount of resources, but for several years now productivity growth has stopped in the UK.

The UK's economic growth over the last couple of years has been driven almost entirely by people returning to employment. This is a problem, because the closer you get to full employment, the fewer gains you can make in this area. At that point, economic growth can no longer come from rising employment, and can only come from two sources: productivity growth and population growth.

If the UK's productivity remains stagnant, as it has been for several years now, then our economic growth will be limited to the rate of population growth. All forecasts of UK economic growth assume that the UK's productivity will return to pre-crisis rates of growth, but it's looking increasingly unlikely that this will happen. Something has gone wrong with UK productivity and no one is addressing it.

The Financial Times, and Martin Wolf in particular, has been hammering on this issue for months now, but politicians seem to be ignoring it entirely.

Another possibility is to focus on prize winners in contemporary literature, not the Pulitzers (only American fiction qualifies for a Pulitzer) but for British, Irish and Commonwealth Literature then the lists of Costa Book Prize (previously Whitbread Prize) and the Man Booker Prize are good places to find the highest quality works.

And finally reading British broadsheet papers has usually been a good way to access high quality written English. These days thats less true than it was but The Times and possibly The Guardian are still reasonably well written papers.

I'm not debating that it's not an issue at all, and it's clearly something that needs ironing out, but I don't see it as the be-all and end-all. The opposition I've seen to this trade agreement has been far too focused on the ISDS issue, which seems to me like a small hurdle at worst, rather than an absolute deal breaker.

&gt;I feel that the trade deal is being done to benefit big multi national business and investors. I feel the average person won't benefit and neither will smaller companies.

I fear the possibility of too much corporate influence as much as anyone, but it's undeniable that in a capitalist economy what benefits corporations is often also to the benefit of citizens. Not always, obviously, but economic growth and job creation are things we want, and they're *definitely* things which the developing world wants.

null,false,q_pop,eng-lestershire,Leicestershire,null,"&gt; It is sometimes suggested that a significant amount of rising employment is made up of temporary, self-employed or part-time workers.
&gt; 
&gt; There is some evidence of a rise of self-employment in the figures. The number of employees has risen by just under 5 per cent since the election, while the number of people in self-employment has gone up by just under 14 per cent.
&gt; 
&gt; But the number of full-time and part-time workers has risen by almost exactly the same proportion – about 6 per cent.
&gt; 
&gt; The percentage of all employees who are doing a temporary job, for various reasons, has risen very slightly under the coalition, from 6 to 6.4 per cent.
&gt; 
&gt; The issue of people working on zero-hours contracts is a tricky one. The ONS has published figures suggesting that 2 per cent of people in employment are on a zero-hours contract – or about 622,000 people. But we don’t know whether that is more or less than in 2010.
&gt; 
&gt; Last year the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir Andrew Dilnot, gave Labour a slap on the wrist over a dodgy press release that claimed there had been a “huge increase” in zero hours contracts under David Cameron, when there was no evidence of a rise.

He remains on good terms with Rupert Murdoch,[1] whom Gove described in evidence before the Leveson Inquiry as ""one of the most impressive and significant figures of the last 50 years"".[15] He has also written a sympathetic biography of Michael Portillo and a critical study of the Northern Ireland peace process, The Price of Peace, for which he won the Charles Douglas-Home Prize.[12] He has worked for the BBC's Today programme, On The Record, Scottish Television and the Channel 4 monologue programme A Stab in the Dark, alongside David Baddiel and Tracey MacLeod, and was a regular panellist on BBC Radio 4's The Moral Maze and Newsnight Review on BBC Two.[10]

&gt; Gove was a member of the winning team in Grampian Television's quiz show Top Club,[citation needed] and played the school chaplain in the 1995 family comedy A Feast at Midnight.[16][17]

A ""Freeview box"" is a device you attach to an old analogue TV (typically over SCART) to let it receive DVB-T broadcasts. The UK stopped broadcasting analogue TV in 2012, and a lot of people bought cheap Freeview boxes (about £20) instead of replacing their televisions. PVR features like pausing and recording are optional extras which might be included in more expensive boxes.

Your TV should work fine here. As you said, just plug it in to the aerial. Don't forget to retune it; this will be a mostly automatic process, but you will need to trigger it manually.

It's unclear what actual protocol ""High Definition TV Tuner (MPEG-4) - H.264 (with supported operators)"" refers to; if it means DVB-T2, you will be able to pick up HD broadcasts as well as the standard SD ones.

Worth a read, but the TL:DR is:

* There is very little evidence that lots of the new jobs are ""zero hours contracts"", despite opposition claims
* 1/3rd of newly created jobs in the past year or so have gone to non-UK nationals. Similar figures for the whole parliament.

#Explanations, caveats and answers to common questions. 
**The level of unemployment is not calculated from the number of people on out-of-work benefits** so sanctions or the actions of job centres will not affect it. These figures are based on a survey called the Labour Force Survey which samples around 40-45 thousand people every quarter. There are unemployed who are not entitled to out-of-work benefits  (e.g. those with a large household income due to a spouse, those with large savings, or those on sanctions) and there are people who claim JSA but are not unemployed (e.g. those who work less than a certain number of hours or fraudsters), so the two are not the same. The number of people claiming out-of-work benefits is reported separately as the Claimant Count. (See above for those figures)

Zero-hour contracts are not regularly measured (I report them in the table when they are), however there is some regular measure of “underemployment”  by measuring those who are in part-time work but wish to be in full-time work. People self-select whether they are full time or part time. Equally those on temporary contracts who wish to be permanent are counted. (See above for these figures)

The rate of unemployment is an economic measure of spare labour in the workforce not a political measure of how well a government is doing at making sure everyone is happy with their job situation. As such, those on workfare, government training programmes or unpaid internships are not counted as unemployed; they do not currently have spare labour to add to the economy. However those on “Government supported training &amp; employment programmes” are reported separately so you may recast the figures should you wish. (See above for these figures) 

The definition of unemployment requires someone to be actively seeking work in the last four weeks and able to start work in the next two weeks. Those who are out of work and say they want a job but don’t meet this definition are reported separately under Inactive. Note that the Inactive category is only for 16-64 year olds. (See above for these figures)

The figures are calculated by the independent Office of National Statistics based on internationally agreed conventions. The government cannot interfere with the calculation of the figures or set the way in which they are calculated. However knowing how the numbers are calculated does mean governments can set policy accordingly and create targets which may not be in the best interest of the public. 

The numbers are seasonally adjusted, so there should be no effect from things such as Christmas jobs.

Given that the numbers are based on a survey, the figures can never be perfectly accurate and there is a margin of error, e.g. the 95% confidence interval for the unemployment rates is ± 0.2%. The numbers should be seen as approximate and are best understood in terms of the trends they show over time.

Cameron did not know he was going to be handed that note I in fact schofield was reprimanded for doing so, but it was Cameron's answer which implied he knew about the background of the situation as he said ""we have to be careful that we don't start a GAY WITCH HUNT"" which implies he knows and has been briefed on the abusers who claim behind closed doors that they are not paedopholes because they have sex with boys, but that they are just homosexual.

We have at least one in every building at my university.

I can see the need for women's only toilets though because most women have needs that most men don't have in regards to genitalia and body function.

Still though I think there would need to still be men's toilets - did they actually say there wouldn't be, or did they just say that they specifically wanted these two things? Because honestly I'd think that not having a men's toilet would actually diminish some of the benefits you'd gain from gender neutral ones.

Like, can you imagine a trans* person feeling comfortable waiting outside with a bunch of rowdy rugby boys? From my university's consultation about gender neutral toilets that was brought up as an issue by the Trans* representative.

a)  build crap houses.  You can make plenty of houses that people won't pay as much for, but the reason will be there's something wrong with it (too small, too far from transport / jobs etc)

b)  build lots of nice houses.   You could suppress the market by building lots and lots of nice houses but this is hard to do because all the sensible places to build houses already have them.   These developments would therefore need to be in new areas requiring new infrastructure - roads, drains, water gas, electricity and communication lines.   It makes it hugely more expensive that it sounds.   It also makes it harder to find any building contractor willing to get on board with all the initial cost when the self-proclaimed aim of the project is to decrease the sale price from where it is at the moment

c)  stop people who can afford to buy houses at the current price from buying them.  And this is fair how?

d)  have the government build houses and sell them at whatever low price it wants.

Looks like freedom of speech is going to be under attack.  

Tories succumbing to the classic mistake that it's possible to get rid of bad ideas is by banning their expression.  It doesn't work.  Good people find their ability to express ideas is curtailed and bad people find easy ways to circumvent any laws - and it will drive bad ideas underground, where they can't be subjected to open scrutiny.

And what does 'incitement to hatred' entail?  Go read the Quran or the Bible and tell me if either don't contain clear incitements to religious hatred.  

Lastly - this isn't a left or a right thing.  Labour had their own plans to curtail hate speech (i.e. free speech).  There are authoritarians on all sides.

As for why he's dropped off in the second half of the campaign, I think there are a few reasons. He was out injured for a few weeks which killed his momentum, and having less mobile players like Drog start up front instead of Costa gives Cesc less options for passing. I think another big reason is that the team as a whole haven't been as brilliant in the second half of the season. We've done what needs to be done, got some good results, secured big wins even when not playing well, but lots of players around Cesc, like Matic, Oscar, Costa etc. haven't been as sharp in the second half of the season. I also agree that he's probably been given less creative freedom after the Spurs defeat.

&gt; 1. The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a survey of the population of private households, student halls of residence and NHS accommodation.																
&gt; 2. The headline employment rate is the number of people aged 16 to 64 in employment divided by the population aged 16 to 64.              																
&gt; 3. The headline unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people (aged 16+) divided by the economically active population (aged 16+). The     																
&gt; economically active population is defined as those in employment plus those who are unemployed.

Followed by:
 																
&gt; Note on headline employment, unemployment and inactivity rates																
&gt; The headline employment and inactivity rates are based on the population aged 16 to 64 but the headline unemployment rate is based on the									
&gt; economically active population aged 16 and over. The employment and inactivity rates for those aged 16 and over are affected by the inclusion of the      																
&gt; retired population in the denominators and are therefore less meaningful than the rates for those aged from 16 to 64. However, for the unemployment         																
&gt; rate for those aged 16 and over, no such effect occurs as the denominator for the unemployment rate is the economically active population which         																
&gt; only includes people in work or actively seeking and able to work.     																
&gt; 																
&gt; Note on headline employment, unemployment and inactivity levels																
&gt; The headline employment and unemployment levels are for those aged 16 and over; they measure all people in work or actively seeking and able to work.            																
&gt; However, the headline inactivity level is for those aged 16 to 64. The inactivity level for those aged 16 and over is less meaningful as it includes elderly

Then got into the habit of buyng a pack in the pub and sharing it with a mate over a couple of pitchers. But eventually - and due to anxiety primarily as I was not then addicted - i got into the habit of buying packs for myself to smoke in the evening after a hard day. At uni i would work and train during the day and study at night and into the early hours, and when you spend that long alone when everyone else is asleep or out hwving fun ts not hard to develop habits that let you rela or give yourself an excuse to nip outside for a few minutes. it meant I had cigarettes left over in the morning, which i'd turn to. Then in the day. Then in the evening. Then at night. Then at all times of the day, every day, for 8 years.

Unless you start really young, there's more thab often a reason behind smoking and very rarely do people wake up one morning and decide to become a smoker.

And the thing about smoking is that many people don't recognise they are addicted until its too late. Looking back now I can see how stupid it is, but at the time it wasn't even something to be concerned about. It was just something to enjoy, not a killer habit that is going to potentially wreck your life and cost you a lot in money and health.

I've quit cigarettes now, but use a vaporiser so technically i'm still addicted. I wish it was easy for everyone to go cold turkey, but it doesn't work that way.

&gt;  Is there any way for me to get a better rate on my cash ISA and not block my ability to get a help to buy ISA? 

Yes.  There is nothing whatsoever preventing you transferring your existing ISA funds into a new account with a better rate.  ""Subscribing"" in this context means putting in new money from outside any ISA wrapper.  Transferring money between ISAs does not count as subscribing so long as you do it using your new provider's transfer process.  DO NOT just withdraw the money from the existing ISA.

&gt;Regardless, in most cases that ISDS is undertaken it's not nearly as egregiously against the public interest as the Philip Morris case. Pretty much all successful ISDS cases are when the government takes political decisions which disproportionately disfavour foreign companies. For example, an early use of ISDS was when Canada banned a fuel additive that was only used by one company (foreign) called Ethyl Corp on the basis of health reasons. Ethyl Corp sued, saying the additive was actually banned for political reasons rather than on any scientific grounds, and the Canadian government chose to settle - paying them some $20 million dollars and withdrawing the law they were implementing.

&gt;On the face of it, it seems like Ethyl Corp was the bad guy and the Canadian government was pursuing legitimate policy in the public interest, and this is certainly how it was played out in the media. In actual fact, Ethyl Corp presented the Canadian governments own documents[1] (p.4 onwards), coming from the Health and Environmental departments, dating to about a year prior that unequivocally stated that there was absolutely zero danger from using the additive in fuel.

Ed Balls, in 2010, got 18,365 votes, which was 37.6% of the total.

In 2015, he got 18,354 votes - 38.0% of the total.

So while technically, yes, he did manage to lose a whole 11 votes in the five years, he actually **increased** his share of the vote.  If every single voter who backed him in 2010 backed him again in 2015, he'd still have lost.

What did for him, was that the Tory vote went from 17,264 (35.3%) to 18,776 (38.9%).

This is largely through individual members of the Church being involved with them at the moment, although the idea is that these groups and others might want to use office space in the Irving Building if we manage to buy it. 

I'm aware that other individuals in the Church have contact with Muslim groups though I dont know names of these. I know for many years the Church has held a regular annual BBQ for the community, inviting all residents, including Muslims to come along and when I've attended it always seems to be full of local residents, and the Halal burgers are snapped up. We have a monthly film club open to everyone, and we also have a live nativity every Christmas, which is often attended by many local residents and their children who don't otherwise attend the Church.

At the moment the ability of the Church to do much more is a bit constrained by space and resources. So talk of what more they can do if they had a bigger building will have to remain in the realm of possibilities until they are able to make them more real. 

But please do fill in the survey to send your feedback to the people involved in this. Even if it's constructive criticism, it will be realy helpful to guide their engagement with the community.

No they're not. No corporations are writing this. They're advising the negotiators in certain areas (it would be stupid to create a policy on the chemical industry without consulting stakeholders). NGOs are also involved heavily, the EU is constantly *begging* for public consultations and comments to be sent in - they even have a website dedicated for it. They constantly request that people come to consultation meetings, film them, upload them to youtube (I've watched a couple of them). 

Secondly, all negotiations are done in some degree of secrecy as I've outlined [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/32bdez/my_grandad_reads_the_paper_everyday_and_hasnt/cq9w6y2) in the past.

&gt;the intention was always to have secret negotiations, mainly driven by corps then to have a very short public consultation without the ability to amend parts of it.

In the case of the BA Law with Law Studies in Europe programme the college decision needs to be approved by the Faculty. You may choose which college you apply to or, if you prefer, the Admissions Office will choose one for you.

So the club can take their time to go over everything and if they find something dodgy they'll probably rip up the contract. If not then he will get his money back.

null,false,Online_mong_land,null,null,null,"&gt; There is a huge difference between demonstrating that growth is theoretically finite (trivially easy) and demonstrating that we're anywhere near close to that point (very hard).

Sure, I wouldn't disagree.  This semantic doesn't go towards addressing the question however.

&gt;Most arguments about limits on growth focus on natural resources, but in reality, economic growth in modern, advanced economies stems largely from financial and technological advance and innovation in legal and social structures

I would counter with - if you can't eat it, then it only has value if people believe it has value.  You can make all the advancements in the world, but if nothing tangible is happening, then you're really just clinging on to dear life by convincing everyone that whatever it is that is growing, does in fact have value.

&gt;There are so many ways in which our energy, transport, educational and health infrastructures could be significantly upgraded that there are innumerable clear avenues for economic growth at the present time.

Sure, but as you said yourself;  *That issue is productivity: the value the UK is able to extract from its land, labour and capital.*  I mean, that was your own argument, which I happen to agree with, and it goes against your final bullet point.

&gt;One day humanity may have to face up to hard limits on growth, but it seems to me that this is hundreds of years away

Again, whether this is truw or false does not go towards answering my initial question.  Is the real problem here that we do in fact have an obsession with growth?

Of these:
&gt; No attacks explicitly classified as religiously inspired terrorism, right-wing terrorism or single-issue terrorism were 
reported by the EU Member States in 2013. However, two persons were killed in the UK in two separate terrorist attacks, one motivated by religious extremism and the other by right-wing extremist ideology.

Google puts the 2013 UK population at 64.1 **million** people, and if we assume that the 2 were the people doing the act of terrorism in the first place. that's 2/64,100,000. The chart specifies there were 35 *total* cases of terrorism in the UK that year, although the type isn't specified.

Across the whole of the EU, there were 535 individuals arrested for terrorism-related offences. For 35 UK cases of terrorism, 77 individuals were arrested.

&gt; In 2013 arrests for religiously inspired terrorism represented the largest proportion of arrests in the EU

There were 216 arrests for religiously inspired terrorism in the EU. 143 of those were in France. Our numbers here are a tad skewed as we didn't specify.

null,false,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,null,"&gt; For example, when the smoking ban came in, the Government would have been sued for billions by the tobacco industry, because they would argue that their profits have been hurt by this legislation.

Completely incorrect - this is just a silly ""example"" made up by someone who either doesn't understand or is simply fearmongering with bs on purpose.

The analogy would be more like this:

If the government had specifically made a deal with a tobacco firm to come and set up production in the UK on the basis of our huge smoking market backed by laws that allow smoking in bars, restaurants, workplaces, etc. ***and then*** after attracting investment from a company based on this, turned around and banned smoking in public places, *then* and *only then* would this company have any way to take successful legal action.

And it wouldn't be suing to gain 20 years of profits or whatever either, it would simply be to get the money back that they invested in this country - an investment that would now be worthless due to the change in legislation.

So we're not even talking about the country losing out, we're simply giving back money that was already gained when the construction workers, planners, electricians, and thousands of others were employed to set up, build, and run this tobacco factory.

Basically all it does is make sure governments can't fuck around with foreign investors and screw them over.

Really it's a positive thing, because companies knowing this are *more likely* to invest in your country knowing there are safeguards in place.

When you're in a safe Tory seat with no on-paper likelihood of electing a Labour MP, the CLP goal isn't just the cynical throwing up candidates to make up numbers.  A lot of what I've seen my CLP do instead is putting pressure on the local establishment, bringing up and being vocal about issues, and working from convictions instead of career aspirations.

_This_ is how we can really pull Labour back from the brink of disaster.  If we can show to people that Labour isn't about winning seats, it's about making a change, then we strengthen the cause and existence of the ‘don't bother campaigning’ CLPs, we prove the ‘party politics is dead’ people wrong, _and_ we get our message out early, loud, and clear.

(PS: I have to admit I felt it was rather cynical that most of Labour HQ's communications to me came in the form of ‘don't bother in Harrogate and Knaresborough, go and campaign in Pudsey instead’.  Yes, campaigning in marginals is very important, nationally we have limited resources to allocate, and without seats we have no mandate for national change.

I don't want to take the funding away from the staggeringly vast majority of parents who are doing their best and doing it properly - I just want to add oversight and a safety net to catch out the small minority who do badly, and help correct their course.

I don't like Diane Abbott much, and part of the reason why is that if she genuinely felt like attacking pensioners was what the country needed (""We should have spent five years reminding people endlessly that 50% of the welfare budget goes on the elderly"") or that the Labour message on immegration was a ""predictably... a doomed endeavour"", she should have said so during the election, or - even better - beforehand. If she thought that the party was losing its way by failing to challenge the message on austerity, she either could have written articles like this in the *Guardian* or challenged Milliband for his leadership. However, I find it absolutely impossible to believe someone like Abbott would be saying these things if Labour had won the election (or even prevented the Conservatives taking a majority) because she wasn't saying them when they appeared to be popular and polling well.

At best, Abbott comes across as a sycophantic lackey of the party heirarchy by not speaking out during the election about these problems with Labour that seem so 'obvious' now. At worse, this is a very confused performance where she tries to spin a U-turn as a deeply held conviction while attempting to retain at least the impression of loyalty to Milliband.",null,1,null,1431519884,null,0,false,0,cr7nrmw,null,t3_35tddp,null,t1_cr7nrmw,null,t1_cr7m6hr,null,null,null,1433038130,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

At the time I shared a flat with my ex-partner, Stacy, who I was mostly still on good terms with. She had found a new partner, Laura, who was abusive toward her but she stayed with nonetheless. I hadn't met Laura face to face - but Stacy had come home with bruises on numerous occasions and I had to call the police and have them visit Laura's address at one point when I received a desperate phone call from Stacy and overheard the abuse in the background. Needless to say, I didn't like her at all and I made it clear to Stacy that I didn't want Laura in our flat.

On the night in question, Stacy invited Laura around and I told her she wasn't welcome because of her past abuse (and I worried for my own safety, too). I told her that if she came in, I'd call the police to have her removed. Stacy wasn't happy with this - she wanted Laura to stay round.

She came in anyway and refused to leave when I asked her, so I called the police. They came round, but they barely spent any time getting my side of the story - they spoke to Stacy and Laura separately, and then came back and arrested me. (As soon as the police arrived, the other two were frantically making me out to be the aggressor, while I was maintaining calm - unfortunately this had the effect of them being able to get the first word in, and I suspect the police formed first impressions about me quite quickly. Also coupled with the fact that I am a trans female, a subject that the police just wouldn't drop over the next 24 hours...)

I do not know exactly what was said that resulted in my arrest, but I have bits and pieces of information. When I was interviewed by the police, their line of questioning implied that they thought I had poured paraffin on the floor outside Stacy's room. I gave a silent interview and refused to answer any questions. I also found out later that they had sent forensics round, who found no evidence of that happening.

I do keep paraffin, as I do fire staff and fire breathing. At one point during the night, before the police arrived, Stacy was talking at me in my doorway and said, ""Your room stinks of petrol."" I corrected her and said, ""No, it's paraffin actually."" and picked up the bottle to show her.

The police maintain that they didn't do anything wrong, and that I could just have easily have been arrested for Affray, which would have had the same result. But I'm not so sure - firstly, why offer a settlement if they're so sure they did nothing wrong? Secondly, I've been looking through the records. At no point in Laura's statement does she say that I actually poured paraffin on the floor. It says that I picked up the bottle (which is true) but nothing else.

Stacy didn't even give a written statement. I spoke to her after all was said and done and she was adamant that she hadn't said that I had poured paraffin on the floor. (She could be lying, but I do believe her for various reasons, mainly her reaction when I questioned her about it). Also if she did, why was she not arrested for making a false accusation when forensics discovered it to be false?

It was only in the officer's statement that it says anything about paraffin actually being poured on the floor - and even then the wording is vague. It doesn't say which of the two (if either) actually made the allegation. My suspicion is that the officer fabricated that bit in order to justify the arrest once he realised he'd screwed up.",null,0,null,1431519886,null,0,false,0,cr7nrns,null,t3_35sh9i,null,t1_cr7nrns,null,t1_cr7mwz5,null,null,null,1433038130,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

null,false,Glitter-Herpes,eng-lancashire,Wigan - Land of the Pies,null,"&gt; Then take the responsibity for grades off teachers and onto students! We're producing a generation of lazy, reactive students with poor subject knowledge because it's politically easier to keep kicking teachers rather than instill some personal responsibility.    

This is true to an extent but a balance would make a lot more sense. There are bad teachers out there. Not just professionally but in terms of knowledge too.   

Very low-level learners can be easily shunned and ignored in High School if they don't have passionate and dedicated teaching support staff.   

Then what happens is that these people are then dropped off in my classrooms once they've left school and are now in the FE sector, and it's my job to ensure they eventually obtain their L2 in English and/or Maths.   

Do a lot of them have a bad attitude? Yes they do, but once you get to know them it can be really eye-opening:  

Drug and alcohol misuse, abusive home life, shit upbringing, *some* High School teachers who didn't give a shit about them and either ignored them or spent too much time shouting at them instead of educating them. These teachers exist, and they're the teachers who don't see teaching as facilitating.   

The students sometimes say they really like me, and although that's nice it's pretty obvious as to why. I facilitate them. I listen to them. I don't talk to them or treat them like they're 10-years-old.  

Now that's out of the way the balance becomes a lot clearer. Now these learners should start taking some responsibility. I'd be a millionaire if I had a quid for every time I heard a learner say ""I can't be arsed today."" Well, be arsed. You're a young adult. I'm doing my bit so now do yours.  

This works if you build a rapport with learners like that, something some High School teachers don't do because they're either too busy and have too many students (hence the need for more support staff) or they outright just don't care.  

As for knowledge, that can be shocking too. When I first started, I was provided with some lesson resources such as a PP presentation for Entry Level Literacy, and the slides were plagued with spelling errors, for example.

I'm Welsh. I grew up in south Wales close to Port Talbot. When you open your mouth to speak to a group of people they might think 'posh cunt' or 'out of touch Etonian', but they won't automatically assume that you're stupid or what you have to say isn't going to be very interesting or relevant.

But whenever I open my mouth to speak to a group of unknown people I get people tuning out, people assuming that I'm stupid or uneducated purely because of how I form words, and other people who can't get over the way I pronounce certain words for long enough to stop giggling to actually pay attention.

The sorts of stereotypes associated with sounding 'posh' are less damaging than the ones attached to sounding 'poor', 'stupid' (or Welsh - a byword for both!).

FWIW I don't think it's particularly useful to harp on at anyone for how they speak. It's divisive and often counterproductive. You want me to participate? Stop fucking laughing every time I say the word 'ear' 'incorrectly' then! Or stop asking me to say certain words over again because it's 'funny', or pretending that you didn't hear me so that I have to say it again...

General you, not you specifically. I do agree with you of course, but I felt like I should point out the fundamental difference between the two things. In your scenario people make fun, think it's a bit weird etc, but ultimately actually it's a positive factor in your life. People tend to think that people with certain accents are more intelligent, more trustworthy, more competent, than people who don't have similar accents.

At this point it's presumably a question of when they carry out a share issue, how much it's for, at what price and who invests. If King or King's group are planning to put money in they'll want the shares to be dirt cheap to dilute Ashley and the other investors they can't count on.

Ashley must know that, if he can get King's money into the club at a higher price Ashley's own investment is less diluted.

I guess it's not as simple as this when you think of everything involved but maybe the share price takes a further hit if we're knocked out of the play-offs, and King would rather wait and see if that happens.

So in this case no personal allowance is applied until the employer receives your tax code from HMRC which can take weeks and all pay gets taxed at 20%, not just everything above £200 a week. If you start a job in these circumstances close enough to the end of the tax year, the refund that automatically occurs when an employer gets informed of the details from HMRC may not happen if they don't get it in time and you have to contact HMRC to get the refund.

Usually during normal employment your annual tax allowance is split between the number of pay periods you have, i.e divided by 12 if you're paid monthly, 52 if weekly, and applied accordingly to that pay packet. Usually the employer also works out the income to date for the current tax year, how much tax you've paid, how much you should have paid and adjusts it on the fly.

I only work for 2 days a week (and only 6 hours per shift...), but my activities outside of work give my life structure, and meaning, I appointed a team to help me with my growing social club which I feel does contribute to the community as it keeps 20-30 people off the streets once a week.

I really do understand democracy, you're just missing the point no matter how I put it to you. I'll try again. The point is that the way in which the Tories won a majority in Parliament, i.e. won the most seats, was not democratic.

&gt; They also wouldn't have to be in a coalition to be in power.

You're right. What I meant was that a Tory government would have relied on a coalition partner to command a majority in Parliament.

&gt; Also I do have a problem with the 1974 election, that is absolutely undemocratic, but that isn't even close to what happened in the 2015 election so I'm not sure why you are bringing it up

I'm bringing it up because you said it would have been a problem. I'm also bringing it up because, even though it doesn't apply to the Tories this time around, it does hurt your argument that having the most seats means you've been democratically elected to a majority (""he party with the most seats wins, not necessarily the one with a majority of the votes.""}. Labour had the most seats but you (rightly) say their majority was undemocratic. My point is that this majority is also undemocratic as the Tories had only 36% of the votes but won over 50% of the seats.

&gt; It really shows, I guarantee you'd have no problems with our democratic system if the Tory's hadn't won.

You're in no position to guarantee that and you're wrong. I was actually hoping for a Labour victory but for them to be forced into coalition, and for their coalition partners to demand PR. I have had a problem with our electoral system since I've been aware of how it works, and that would not have changed just because of a Tory defeat. My argument here has nothing to do with my hatred of the Conservative Party.

&gt; How else would you describe the UK? A dictatorship? Totalitarian? those are the alternatives to democracy.

How would you describe the UK after the 1974 election? A dictatorship? Totalitarian? To call something undemocratic is not to call it totalitarian.

Obviously things like 'having our own army' or 'controlling our own foreign policy' we can't do unless we're independent.

But largely I think a more expansive devolution settlement would sort us out. If the problem is Westminster being too London-centric then we should set up devolved administrations in England too and reduce the power of Westminster to make these decisions.

A Welsh government based in Wales as part of the UK could achieve a lot, if the Welsh people were more engaged in Welsh politics and the Assembly had more money/powers.

You can clearly see that SI is not designed well for everyday use from the fact that there are no units of measurement between 1cm and 1m, nor between 1m and 1km. The human mind deals better with small units, and how much of human life is lived between those two scales?

We would have been the red and blues were it not for the Southern League rules that prohibited to clubs from having similar colours which meant that we changed to chocolate and gold (which for historical reasons is our ""true"" colours). The now Lilywhite kit (or the famous blue shorts and white top) is itself a homage to the original ""invincibles"" of Preston North End who get the blue/white and red from their badge (white lamb of st wilfrid sat atop a blue background with three red roses on a white background above).

Fun fact and side note: PNE as a founder member of the league have the right to wear their home colours wherever they play.

Will the IFA focus their limited resources on players likely to play for them and let the FAI take up the slack? As Irish citizens Mclean, Gibson and those lads have every right to play for their country but it might become more practical for the IFA to focus on more solid long term prospects. I would have sit down with parents and the player at 18, ask them if they wanted to continue with N.I, if not I would respect that and give them a good reference with the FAI.

The only concern I have is that over the past 3 years, two being in Europe, Rodgers has yet to find the right balance with the added games. Again I've said this before that I know 3 years isn't a solid time frame to judge a manager, but how long will it take for him to find it/ find the right balance to win in both Europe and domestically. Now I understand the Europa league is important for experience and building, especially for European points, but wouldn't it be better to just have a recovery year in domestic competition only, it did wonders for us and has helped turn Man U ,objectively, (as much as I hate to say it) around. Then trying to gain experience in the champions league in the 16/17 season potentially by focusing on earning the spot in 15/16. My biggest concern is that we may not have a stable team going into next season, Rodgers won't have the balance right again, and we will place the same if not lower domestically trying to balance all three domestic completions and the Europa league, where we don't even get the money the champions league brought us from crashing out if we win. I'm asking what is this experience will truly be costing us, based on how long it will take Rodgers and FSG for that matter to figure out, both the roster and building our depth to cope with multiple games per week all season. And yes if we're going to break glass ceilings and build experience, I'd rather focus on being able to do it in a more prestigious completion that pays better and will help in both causes (we're not landing the top quality players we need to rebuild by bragging about the Europa league), than to do it in a lower paying league that doesn't have the player pull the champions league does.

We don't want independence, we just don't want to be treated like the unwanted step-children of Britain. Despite not wanting independence the Welsh have been vocal on a number of issues historically, and there are examples of legislation that specifically spoke about Wales historically. The issue is that we want it recognised that we have distinct needs, desires and social values. The Disestablishment Act (1914) was one such piece of legislation pertaining to Wales, another was the Sunday Closing Acts. Both things pushed for recognition of Wales as a discrete entity. Wales has also had a lot of civic nationalism - institutions like the National Library of Wales, the University of Wales, cultural festivals etc. We weren't as big on terrorism as the Irish were but we also weren't just poorer versions of English people living in the mountains either.

If the government *rejects* someone doing business in the first place, such as fracking, it's irrelevant - there was never a deal in place, there was never investment in the country. The issue is if the government *accepts* a fracking application, takes money for it, entices a company to invest in the infrastructure, and *then* makes it illegal to frack.

You can't just roll up and say ""oh hey I wanted to make some money but the laws don't let me so I'm gonna sue you"".

One of the key ideas behind economics is how do we distribute resources in a world where supply is finite and demand is infinite. Free trade helps ensure that resources are used efficiently, which is particularly important given the challenges we are facing. 

I'm sorry but policy is not as black and white as most people think. Often the first answer people come up with is the wrong one and that's why its important to at least understand the basics of economics before engaging in debate about policy.

Except all kinds of joinery and metal construction... You could easily argue the contrary using exactly the same argument. Lots of screws are ~1cm in size which is a bit more convenient than the 7/16"" imperial notation. It's coincidental at this point.

&gt;You can clearly see that SI is not designed well for everyday use from the fact that there are no units of measurement between 1cm and 1m

I don't see younger people or people who use metric frequently struggle with visualising those kind of distances. 80cm or 800mm is an adequate description as much as 2 1/2 feet is.

&gt;nor between 1m and 1km

Oh yes because I'm sure people could exactly pace out an acre or a furlong... Those kinds of distances are hard to visualise from the ground regardless.

&gt;The human mind deals better with small units

Isn't that a good argument for SI units then? What about the width of a human hair in imperial? In metric it's 0.1mm, nice and easy.

&gt;but to insist that no one is allowed to use more convenient measures just because they predated the Metric system is crazy

I wonder how they're going to define 'democracy' and 'fundamental British values' more broadly here.

As with the deeply worrying plans to pull us out of the human rights act and replace it with some doubtless loophole-ridden homegrown version, I suspect this will end up being another case of the government using the whipped up fear of scary shouty brown poppy-burning train-bombing nasties to turn up the pressure on political radicals.

Let's see what Wikipedia says: [Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_Investigatory_Powers_Act_2000#Summary)

&gt;enables certain public bodies to demand that an ISP provide access to a customer's communications in secret;

&gt;enables mass surveillance of communications in transit;

&gt;enables certain public bodies to demand ISPs fit equipment to facilitate surveillance;

&gt;enables certain public bodies to demand that someone hand over keys to protected information;

&gt;allows certain public bodies to monitor people's Internet activities;

I would say that enabling and allowing things is equal to granting powers.

&gt;Peoples bins were being 'snooped' before RIPA, it's just that you didn't know about it because there was no requirement to aply for authority or make a note of what you were doing.

And that's a good thing. I have no problem with regulation, transparency and accountability.

null,false,HolySheesh,null,null,null,"I have lived here in Brighton for the last 10 years and am a similar age, so ask any questions you want. I have also been to Manchester numerous times as my grandparents live there, but I feel it's only appropriate now to let you know I will naturally be more biased towards Brighton.

Of the points you made about Brighton:

1) The sea is nice, it's a bit nippy for most of the time (especially compared to Italy) but it is refreshing and definitely swimmable. The beach is one of Brighton's main attractions and especially in the summer it is always buzzing.

2) Correct, depending on the train you get it is 53-71 minutes to London Victoria.

3) True, it also has a huge amount of university and foreign school students here which add to the vibrant characteristics. There are always events aimed at the 16-23 age crowd and the city definitely has a young person feel. Brighton is known for being one of the most liberal cities in the U.K. and Europe.

About your other points:

1) The weather is somewhat better down here but not too noticeably so. Right now it's 15 degrees, the sun is shining and there's a gentle breeze to keep you cool. Come summer it will get to around 18-22 degrees on a good day and might even reach 25-27 (which isn't very high for you Italians!).

2) The 'accent' probably won't be too much of an issue anywhere you go. I guess maybe Brighton is favourable here as we have a southern accent which is similar to most of the English accent portrayed abroad but like I said, this really won't effect you that much anywhere.

3) There's plenty to do out of Brighton. You can visit classic English villages in the countryside like Ditchling, or go to other classic English towns like Eastbourne. We also have the [South Downs National Park](http://southdowns.gov.uk/). You can do lots of physical activities here like hill cycling. Every other week or so me and another friend of mine like to go for a countryside walk here to explore, it's really fantastic.

4) You've said you're not really interested in night life, which is OK because there's a lot to do here that does not require you to be 18. However, the night life here is excellent because of the student market.

5) Brighton is as lively as you think. For a city smaller than 500,000 in the U.K. I don't really know if there is anywhere quite like it. It's unique, liberal (we have the only Green Party seat here in Brighton), has an excellent independent art scene, fantastic architecture ranging from classic regal buildings to modern designs and there is ALWAYS something going on.

I work in Brighton train station and the fact that I see literally thousands of people coming down from London to visit Brighton on the weekend is testament to the attractive city culture that Brighton has.

Manchester is still an excellent city and regardless of where you go I am sure you will enjoy yourself.

Again, feel free to ask any questions about Brighton.

Assuming you look at the lower end, you're talking £160k of borrowing on a £20k basic, which is 8x salary. This just isn't going to happen.

The following is taken from www.caniaffordtobuy.co.uk

&gt; **Summary**
&gt; 
&gt; With a mortgage of £160,000.00 at 4.75% you are looking at repayments of £912.19 per calendar month for 25 years1.
&gt; 
&gt; This is 65.63% of the net monthly income in your household.
&gt; 
&gt; After each payment, you will be left with £477.81 for other expenditure.
&gt; 
&gt; Most lenders will only lend up to 4.5x the gross income of your household2. This means to qualify for the mortgage, you will need to have a gross annual income of at least £35,555.56
&gt; 
&gt; With stricter lending rules that came into force 26th April 2014, lenders may also take into account your discretionary expenditure when deciding your eligibility for a mortgage3.
&gt; 
&gt; As the price of the property is greater than £125,000, you will incur a tax of £1500.00, this is known as Stamp Duty4. 

Maybe you can find property for less than £200,000. On your earnings I would expect potential borrowing to top out at ~£90,000 (4.5x), so £130,000 purchase price is more realistic - is there anything is this price-range in areas, for example, outside of Brighton?

Other options possibly worth pursuing are shared ownership, shared purchase with a friend or relative, or shared equity.

Anyway, here we go:

*One year ago today Belgian Red Devils boss Marc Wilmots surprised everyone. He announced that Divock Origi could join the national team in Brazil for the World Cup. Sporza visited Origi in Lille yesterday and looked back at twelve hectic months.*

When Benteke was injured two months before the WC, there was a vacancy for the striker position at the Belgian national team. Origi, who only had made his debut for the U21 one month earlier, was surprisingly chosen. 

“My selection was a surprise for me as well, it was a special moment”, Origi told Sporza.  “I was at my mother’s at the time of the press conference and all of a sudden I received a lot of text messages.”

“This was a big change in my life. Nobody knew me up until then and suddenly people wanted to know all about me. Not a lot of nineteen year olds experience that.” 

Origi gained his first minutes for the Belgian Red Devils against Luxemburg in a friendly, a couple of weeks before the WC would start. 

“We played in Genk, the town I grew up in. All of my friends and family were watching and all my passes and moves were blown up. It all went well and I made Luxemburg concede a penalty. It was fun.”


*“Scoring on the World Cup was a dream come true”*

The real deal, however, was the World Cup in Brazil, about a month later. Origi started on the bench against Algeria and Russia.  In the 88th minute he scored on a pass by Hazard. In no time Origi became Belgium’s favoured son. 
“It was a dream come true. It’s special for any striker to score at a World Cup. For me, since nobody had truly heard of me, it was even more special. It took a while to realise what happened.”

“They even made a song about me. It’s nice to see you’re being appreciated as a player and as a person. It made me feel good about myself and motivated me.”

Origi kept his cool despite of all the attention and success. “It’s not easy to remain humble, but I was raised properly by my parents and I always have my friends and family around me. They are calm people and have helped me to stay calm myself.”


*“It has not been an easy year”*

After the WC the whole world knew Divock Origi. After a few weeks of rumours, he signed a deal at Liverpool FC. “Signing for a new club is always special. Certainly for a club like Liverpool. It made me very proud. I really looked forward to the new season.”

“The only condition Lille had, was that I was to stay another year on a loan deal. I thought it was a good idea, I felt good at Lille and I would be able to make progress here.”

“Liverpool wanted me to play in England immediately, but things turned out different. In hindsight everyone knows it hasn’t been an easy year, but I have learnt a lot. As a player as well as a person.”

“I expect a lot of myself and always try to make progress in difficult situations. On the other hand there have been periods of time in which I played well. The start of the season was good, afterwards there was a period of less great form. But I never disappointed at the national team, I think.

“If I want to become a great player, I’ll have to perform more consistent. I can’t be happy with a season like this.”




*“People forgot I was only 19 years old”*

Origi had one of his most painful experiences in December. In the EL game against Wolfsburg he was booed after missing a penalty. “It was a disappointment for everybody, I didn’t take the booing personally. Even the greatest player in the world, Cristiano Ronaldo, gets booed.”

(note: I’m not a native speaker, I can’t recall if there’s a specific word for whistling at the own player, if so, use it instead of booing.)

“The booing meant people expect a lot. It made me stronger and changed my views on supporters and the football world in general. Everything can go fast, but there are two sides to a coin. The experience is valuable for when I have a tough time later on in my career.”

“I came back as an international who had played at a World Cup and I made a transfer to Liverpool for 12,5 million euros. People expect a certain amount of goals and consistency from such a player, but forgot I was only 19 years old. I only had five days of vacation time after the WC, immediately played the play-off round of the CL and had only been at Lille’s first team for a year and a half. The team itself had a hard time as well, it’s not easy to try and carry a team as a youngster.”


*“The Premier League will be a whole new world”*

Next season all will change again for Origi. In July he’ll start his adventure in the Premier League. “It’ll be a whole new world, but those who want to become great players, need to get through it.”

“It’s going to be interesting to see how I’ll fit in, what the level of play and the general atmosphere is like. I’m not scared, but very motivated. I’m full of confidence. It’s great fun to start for a new club.”

“I was updated frequently by LFC’s manager and staff. They kept a close look on me. Brendan Rodgers told me to work hard and that he was looking forward to working together. He wants me to give it my all and learn. In this case we are both confident that it will work out.”

“Where will I be in ten years? That’s very difficult to predict. I want to keep on learning every year. In the end it’s my dream to be an important player for one of the biggest clubs in the world.”

“The first step has been made by signing for Liverpool. Now it begins. The road is very long, but I’m convinced that the right people surround me. Now it’s up to me to work hard.”

*“I hope Belgium wins the Euros”*

Euro 2016 in France is creeping near. Origi has a lot of competition with a fit Benteke and an in form Lukaku and the ascent of Michy Batshuayi. 
“I’m happy that everyone’s back. We need everybody. The competition for a starting position gets bigger, but everyone will work harder and that’s important. If you see players around you performing at a high level, you pull yourself up to that. Whoever plays, will have earned it.”

About the ambitions with the Belgan Red Devils:
“We’ll need to perform at a high level, but we have good players, a good manager and fantastic supporters. We’ve got everything that’s needed to progress in the Euros. The expectations need to be high, expectations make you work harder and it’s positive pressure. I hope Belgium wins the final…”

The fear is that decriminalisation will lead to an immediate drop in revenue if more people choose to take the chance (bad), inhibit the BBC's ability to make long term plans unless it's accompanied by a comprehensive review of funding (worse) and ultimately by merely the start of a process that will kill off the BBC in anything like its current form (worst).

Your savings are great for your age, but with £20-£23k in income, you'd only be able to borrow £90k ish max . From a quick look on Zoopla, it looks like a nice 2 bed in Brighton could be had for around £250,000. 

Is the £40k representative of your entire savings or just your inheritance? With £40k down, you'd need a mortgage of £210k. Your monthly mortgage payments would be just a lick below £1k. The mortgage alone would be more than half your income pre-tax and that doesn't include bills, council tax, insurance, ground rent, service charge (if applicable), etc. You'll also need about £7k to cover purchase costs such as stamp duty, conveyancing fees, survey fees, moving fees, mortgage booking fee, etc. You're also going to want some money in savings after that! A reasonable amount is probably at least 6 months for living expenses + mortgage payments. Suffice it to say, you wouldn't be able to use the full £40k as a deposit if its representative of your entire savings.

While its a nice idea to rent out the second room, this will not be allowed legally as a term of your mortgage. A mortgage company may be willing to suspend such term, but they would only do so if they knew you could afford the mortgage without the additional income.

Are you looking to live outside of Brighton? If so, I think you could afford a flat up to around £120k if £40k is your entire savings fund.

A housing association. 

You start out buy buying a portion of the ownership (supported by a mortgage if necessary) while they continue to own the rest, and you can later choose to buy further shares of the property at whatever the market rate for the place is by that point. 

Then when you want to sell, the housing association has some rights to either find a buyer or buy it back from you.

Sure, Brighton is a nice place, but if you are here for 6 weeks Manchester has a number of advantages:

* From Manchester you can travel so easy to many different places, as other people have pointed out. You can go to Liverpool in 30 minutes or less, you can go to the beach in north wales in ~2 hours, you can go to the lake district, the peak district, Chester, Sheffield, maybe even Birmingham or York.

* It will be slightly cheaper travelling around the north than the south.

* The weather won't be very different, in the summer.

The two main molecules in air, oxygen and nitrogen, are very small compared to the wavelengths of the incoming sunlight—about a thousand times smaller. That means that they preferentially scatter the shortest wavelengths, which are the blues and purples. Basically, that's why the daytime sky is blue. The daytime sky would actually look purple to humans were it not for the fact that the sensitivity of our eyes peaks in the middle [green] part of the spectrum—that is, closer to blue than to purple.

But at sunset, the light takes a much longer path through the atmosphere to your eye than it did at noon, when the sun was right overhead. And that is enough to make a big difference as far as our human eyes are concerned. It means that much of the blue has scattered out long before the light reaches us.

First of all, you know you can generally sue anyone for anything that is even remotely within the bounds of reasonable at any time (that is, assuming it doesn't get thrown out before being heard in court). You can sue a dry-cleaners for millions for losing your pants, as a famous example.

Now you're using the fact that Philip Morris is suing the Australian government as an argument without looking at the reason why.

First, it's not for the same reason (banning smoking in a certain place is not anywhere near the same as infringing on their trademark rights)...

One is simply a law saying what actively harmful activities people can do in a public space, that's outside the realm of what a tobacco company can do anything about on the basis of *trademarks* which is the case here. This isn't about a law situation that was used to garner investment, after all.

And the other hand you have the government imposing what a company can legally print on it's product packaging.

So... it's meaningless first of all unless they win, because if they don't win then it'll be another great example of how the arbitration system doesn't mindlessly force governments to pay our to corporations (and most of the time, this is how these cases go). But secondly it's only meaningful if they win for a bad reason.

So what is a good or bad reason?

People only view this case negatively because it's big evil tobacco and smoking is bad and blah blah. I agree with that, fuck Philip Morris and everything they stand for. But if it was an organic fruit juice company in the exact same position who had been forced to stop using their branding on their bottles then people would have different views.

But the law doesn't discriminate like that, and as it shouldn't.

So let me ask you a question, do you think the government should have the power to stop any company at any point it chooses to stop using their branding on their product packaging?

That would be pretty fucked up, no?

But maybe if there's a public health issue that made them take this action against the packaging it should be permitted? Maybe?

So shouldn't there be some legal recourse when this happens?

And that's what this fucking case IS!!!

It's an arbitration deciding what takes precedence, a company's right to print it's branding onto products, or a governments health legislation  about exactly what can and can't be forced regarding product packaging and branding.

null,false,LozBinding,cnty-england,England,null,"I wasn't even going to reply but it annoyed me how you're misinterpreting this. Cutting benefits to these individuals effected by addiction will not help them. What will help them is attempting to get them back on their feet again through CBT and other forms of psychological techniques I.E. Aversion therapy. All of these cost a lot more money to the NHS than it would be to simply allow them to continue on smoking (Maybe not in the long run but our government doesn't care about that). Therefore it is advantageous for them to continue on smoking or doing Heroin, in the eyes of money saving. The treatment which has found to be most effective is rehab where they employ a number of techniques including the ones mentioned before to attempt to change you as a person. The NHS doesn't really offer rehab anymore due to the cost of it, so when you say they should 'get help' it is actually impossible to get the help they need without spending money from the benefits on it. Using the example of Heroin the NHS simply offers a clinical alternative to it which produces the same effects its just controlled, this often leads to individuals using Heroin and the alternative because their thought patterns and reasoning haven't been changed. 


Furthermore in response to the reply you gave me I think you're making an assumption that addiction is purely biological, I.E. It has to be initiated for it to become addictive and can be kicked quite easily. There are a number of factors which affect addiction which aren't just purely biological, personality types play a massive role, the environment where you live can massively affect addiction and stress. Those who end up on benefits are simply those who have suffered significant life events (Stress), grew up around people doing drugs (environment) or have a desire they need fulfilled (personality). When you say they refuse treatment to these drugs you're simply stating they're not taking X which is free on NHS which costs you more money, as stated before the NHS does fuck all in terms of actually attempting to cure addiction than merely provide an alternative. The waiting list for CBT is currently upwards of 6 months for those which are HIGH RISK, addicts are not considered high risk when they can just offer an alternative to the drug.

null,false,Starlifter141,null,null,null,"I haven’t been to either event, but here’s my lengthy rationalization of which one I chose to go to and why.


Comic cons happen yearly and in various locations. But if it’s a first time for you at a con, or at the NY con, or a particular actor/writer, show (DW) or discussion is going to be there that you want to see/hear, you may prefer to go to the con.


However, this is the first time the DW Symphonic Spectacular has come to the U.S., and the only announced visit for this year. Future plans are unknown - if it sells out it “may” return next year.


You can get a feel for the DW symphonic experience looking at show clips on YouTube and on their website (www.doctorwhosymphonicspectacular.com or http://www.doctorwho.tv/events/doctor-who-symphonic-spectacular/). The show is a combination musical performance and stage show. If you haven’t attended a (NY) con before there should be YouTube clips of that as well.


Tickets for either event can be pricey depending on the extras (e.g. autographs, photos) or seating area (e.g. VIP versus full price) that you are looking for. The extras that you want and the cost of the extras may be factors to consider.


I am going by myself. The cost of going alone or going with a significant other may be a major determining factor.


The timing of each event and time that you have available to spend at each may also be factors to consider - a weekend at a con versus a two hour midweek performance.




**TL;DR**  For myself, I can afford one but not both events. I chose the DW Symphonic Spectacular as I will have other opportunities to go to a con. I paid a premium for VIP seating to get the most out of it. I live 200 miles away, will be taking time off from work, and will incur travel costs but, for myself, feel it is worth it. Whatever you choose will be a good choice for you. Enjoy.

I used a function written by [someone else](https://github.com/kjhealy/uk-elections/blob/master/data/uk-election-results-2015.csv) to scrape the BBC coverage and get the number of votes per party per seat. I then imported it into Excel and looked for seats UKIP nearly won.

As far as I can see, 487 Tory voters in Thurrock would have needed to change their votes before UKIP hit a key milestone (becoming strictly bigger than the Greens, by number of MPs). 15,740 voters from a mix of parties would have had to change their votes for the next big milestone (becoming bigger than the Lib Dems), or alternatively just 13,673 voters if you can get Lib Dem supporters in Southport to vote UKIP (because then the Lib Dems lose a seat and so UKIP only need 8 to be strictly bigger than them). UKIP could have formed a majority with a swing of 4.1m, as long as that swing happened in such a way that it benefitted them perfectly, so I wouldn't hold out for a UKIP majority any time soon.

However UKIP voters were quite nicely placed to be kingmakers - if all Kippers had voted Labour in every seat where they could, Labour would have taken 302 seats and beaten the Conservatives down to 267. In fact only 2392 UKIP supporters needed to change their vote to prevent a Tory majority (majority at 323 seats, right?), and only 147,000 to give Labour a plurality over the Tories",null,0,null,1431528633,null,0,false,0,cr7rwk4,null,t3_35tnk8,null,t1_cr7rwk4,null,t1_cr7o9bh,null,null,null,1433040079,null,31,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,31,null

We could be funding infrastructure upgrades, construction investment, small business grants and a list of other things to kick-start considerable growth in the British economy at essentially negative interest rates on government borrowing. Of course it would be *targeted* stimulus spending, I'm not going to suggest that more and more spending is always better, but in areas like infrastructure and construction there are significant fiscal multipliers to be had (the returns create wealth several times greater than the investment) which could take the British economy to new heights. Also, the issue of inflation isn't even on the horizon. 

The reason I and many others complain about pandering to the Tory narrative and offering austerity-lite is because Labour never challenged the notion that 'reckless overspending' was the cause of the 2008 crash. A critically under-regulated banking industry was the cause of our troubles (on top of global financial problems). Instead they tried to match the Tories at their own game and buy into the illogical neurosis about the national debt and spending deficit by making ""year on year deficit reduction"" the baseline of their economic policy - taking the focus away from the possibilities of stimulus spending along with fixing broken markets (like the railways and the energy sector) and back to the ridiculous doctrine of austerity that seems based solely on the notion that asceticism is more morally upstanding. 

To take one example, on  the privatization of the Royal Mail Labour could have ripped the Conservatives to pieces. Here was a public company offering a perfectly adequate service that was flogged on the cheap as a loss to the taxpayer, because the only thing that matters to the Tories is that it's privatized - they know the price of everything and the value of nothing... And yet Labour's response to the Royal Mail privatization came across as rather subdued. 

Bringing it back to last Thursday's election, I truly believe that if Labour had offered a clear and coherent plan of targeted economic stimulus they would have done much better. Doing nothing to oppose the 'austerity-consensus' handed the Conservatives the victory on the economy debate.

So what, I'm supposed to post the Guardian article myself, after you already did that? Why go to the effort of doing what you want me to do for me, telling me to do it, and then keeping me in the dark about how you're actually running the sub?

Welp. Ok, I'll submit the Guardian article for you. If you don't want me doing that, I'm sure I'll find out.

So ""blogspam"" is *worse* when there's actually a link to the Guardian?

null,false,RC19842014,null,null,null,"It's not quite as simple as that.  Dukes and duchesses are always referred to as 'the Duke/Duchess of X', rather than 'Lord/Lady X'.  The eldest sons of dukes, marquesses and earls are entitled to use a 'courtesy title', which is usually a lesser title of their father.  If their father lacks any lesser titles, or if the lesser titles have the same name as the main title, one is invented, usually based on the family's surname.  The younger children of dukes and marquesses and the daughters of earls are known as Lord/Lady [Full Name].  All the children of barons and viscounts, and the younger sons of earls, are formally known as the Honourable [Full Name], but in normal conversation would be called Mr/Miss [Surname].
Both the Independent and the Grimsby Telegraph have made a few errors in talking about this incident.  Rather than 'Lord George Worsley', he should probably be called 'Lord Worsley' or 'George Pelham, Lord Worsley', while his father should be called 'the Earl of Yarborough' or 'Charles Pelham, Earl of Yarborough', rather than 'Lord Charles Pelham'.  The Grimsby Telegraph gives his full name as 'George John Sackville Worsley', when the family surname is Pelham.  Confusion may have arisen from the tendency of peers and courtesy peers, especially those involved in politics or sport, to use their title as a surname, such as the former Lib Dem MP John Thurso (Viscount Thurso, whose surname is actually Sinclair) and the racing driver Henry Arundel (Earl of Arundel, whose father is the Duke of Norfolk, and whose surname is Fitzalan-Howard).",null,0,null,1431529025,null,0,1431530275,0,cr7s4nz,null,t3_35pxmm,null,t1_cr7s4nz,null,t1_cr6vpyd,null,null,null,1433040185,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null
