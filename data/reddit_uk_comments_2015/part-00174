I don't actually think the student fees thing is actually THAT bad in terms of its still an extremely favourable loan that you only pay back if you can afford it which seems fair enough. But they clearly directly contradicted a promise that was obviously going to upset a lot of people and obviously lose a lot of votes and seats. Even without that, entering into a coalition with a party they are ideologically opposed to in many areas was absolute madness and they were always going to be guilty by association for a lot of things.  

I'm sure you'll point to some list of things they supposedly stopped but what good was that really? Had they never entered into a coalition none of the bad staff they blocked would have passed in the first place. Now they'll just pass that stuff a couple of years later. Without opposition because they got a majority based on the seats they gained from the Lib Dems collapse. They got some minor concessions through at the price of a complete collapse of their vote which has benefited the conservatives more than any other party 

They've killed themselves as a party, decades of painstaking building to gain seats, to get those 57 seats they had, all gone for nothing. At best it'll be decades till they reach that level of support again, at worst this will be terminal for them. I voted for the Lib Dems in 2010 but frankly the fact they entered into that coalition, and went ahead with the student fee rises, and somehow didn't see that these would be a huge problem showed a party that is at best extremely naive and not fit for helping lead a country, and at worst morally bankrupt at the first sight of any power.

Indeed, but you're using a stupidly extreme example in North Korea that's not really worth addressing (like your left nut) as it's the lowest-ranked democracy in the world. Like when people use *literally* Hitler when they think they're proving a point.

&gt;Er, PR doesn't necessitate non-local representation, and, er, AV was not a proportional system, er.

Depends on what PR you use. And AV was a step in the right direction - I don't remember saying it was proportional, but maybe that was because I was using the referendum on it as an example of....democracy. What does your left nut say?

&gt;Imbalanced equality is not, er, equal.

But it's *recognisably there*. Otherwise (as I said elsewhere in this thread and again in the last reply), one can insist that any vote that doesn't include every single person in the country is not a true democracy, which is just daft. Polarise all you like, but it won't help your argument *or* your left nut.

&gt;Voting for smaller parties to swing the big parties further toward the, er, left or right is not, er, due representation.

Unless it's being used to illustrate how influence exists even when it's not direct. You know, in the name of explaining how it's silly to pretend that people aren't represented at all. In the name of demonstrating how, despite being imperfect, it happens in the name of equality instead of simply being ignored. Does your left nut have an agenda this obvious as well?

We're a communal species and we've got an obligation to make sure that we prevent misery as much as possible. The welfare state is one of the most incredible inventions in the history of humanity and nothing has improved the welfare of people more. By rejecting it, you are essentially saying that you couldn't care less about the welfare of people who aren't born into privilege (i.e. the vast majority of people) or those who are disabled. I'm assuming you're pretty well off given that you're making these statements but I would plead with you to think about people who aren't so fortunate for a moment.

I value freedom over safety, the attitude extends to others. Besides the fact that taxation is becoming more and more impractical to enforce, and regardless of who the tax is on, it ends up on regular people.

I was not born into any sort of privilege, although I am fine-ish now. Hopefully better in the future. Not that my background should be of any particular interest.

&gt;It is less efficient given that every privatisation that has happened so far has resulted in poorer service. Seriously, give me one example of a privatisation that has genuinely improved the quality of a public service.

I've already discussed this, I don't believe that any public service in recent history has been truly privatized. Even railways (which I would say have improved, but I lack firsthand experience) are only a bastardized form of half-privatization. 

Although there have been some experiments elsewhere, for example a US town (Texas, IIRC) hired a private security firm and chucked out their police force. Crime went down and it cost less.

&gt;I seriously don't understand what you're saying. Once again - give me an example of a modern healthcare system that has been genuinely improved through privatisation. The NHS is an incredible thing and regularly ranks as the best healthcare system in the world, despite its shortfalls - and those same reports acknowledge that privatisation is eroding that status. Every single move towards the privatisation of healthcare in this country has made the service worse. Seriously, give me one example - that's all I'm asking for - of privatisation that has actually worked.

I can't give you any, because I don't believe there has been any. I don't see any difference between healthcare and a consumer service, as it shares many characteristics.

&gt;So essentially, what you're advocating is a mass-scale, global economic collapse, which is what's going to happen if the government stops intervening. Which will probably result in social collapse, millions upon millions of unemployed people, inevitably lots of deaths, etc. Total lassaiz-faire free-market capitalism is, admittedly, a lot less hypocritical than the current system but even more cruel and dangerous.

I have no clue why you would think there would be economic collapse without intervention. My company works very hard to remain un-intervined and receive no support whatsoever and does fine. As does the wider group. The vast majority of companies receive little support from the government.

While some larger 'to big to fail' companies would collapse, this is really darwinism. Banks can't take some of the risks they did if they have no-one to bail them out - not that it would stop some of them. Their collapse of course just creates new opportunity for competition.

Take health care for example.  The US has the most expensive and most complicated system by far and consistently gets obliterated by the UK NHS in rankings.  If it goes private you will see the cost of health care become far higher than what you used to pay in taxes while those who run the companies become fantastically rich off of those who become ill.  

There are plenty of examples where people were refused health care and die due to not having insurance.  Even with insurance many people are refused life saving treatments by their insurers due to lack of coverage.  Have adequate insurance and think you're ok?  Think again!  I and many people I know get the most cryptic, outrageous, and incorrect bills for health care any time we need non-standard treatment.  This is done intentionally to prey on people too afraid to fight their insurance company over treatments that should be covered.

At the time I was hitting right up against a dissertation deadline and didn't have enough time to discuss the points made by my parents, which are hardly exclusive to them but actually apply to a majority of the nurses in the hospital they worked in and potentially across the UK.

From how it was described to me, - and bare in mind I'm a student and not a nurse, or a student in nursing, or any of that sort - the hospital for our town was firing a large number of nurses, then attempting to hire them back on with zero-hour contracts. In other words, nurses weren't fired because there was an abundance of nurses, but because the employers wanted to negotiate terms that were more favourable for the employers. The issue with this approach was that there were several private healthcare services willing to hire on additional nurses, so we ended up with a public service NHS hospital that was understaffed by nurses.

Up to this point, I've been telling the point of view of my step-mother, who was fired and, after having received a job at a private healthcare company, received an offer from the very hospital she was fired from to work for them under a zero-hour contract. From this point on, I'll be giving the perspective of my real mother, who is not a nurse any more but still has a job at the public service hospital in an administrative position.

The position she filled had originally been filled by two people, one of which had been fired, so she had been tasked with doing two separate jobs as well as two people would have done in the past. After the firings had occurred, because several departments were understaffed and underperforming, several new managers were hired on to attempt to improve the efficiency of the existing staff. Problem is, when you've already got one person trying to do two people's worth of job, asking them what they feel like the bottleneck is is going to piss them off no matter how you slice it.

The fact that a huge swath of nurses had been fired in order to try and negotiate zero-hour contracts later - and the fact that the hospital was attempting to hire managers, not nurses, to try and compensate for their sudden and unexpected loss of production - resulted in a hospital that simply couldn't cope with the demand it would regularly get and ended up spending roughly the same amount just to get lower gross productivity overall. Waiting times increased and remaining nurses were more overworked than ever.",null,0,null,1431131800,null,0,false,0,cr34sbx,null,t3_359obk,null,t1_cr34sbx,null,t1_cr2vglo,null,null,null,1432853912,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

That said, I'm sceptical he would've made it as a regular anyway. In spite of some flashes of quality.

I feel pretty similar about this transfer in all honesty. Although Firmino doesn't appear to have any injury/fitness problems, so he should transition more smoothly.

As long as he stays fit he should contribute, I doubt it as a regular starter however. More of a rotational signing, squad strengthener.

They will be given new powers, maybe ten years on we'll have another one.

Step two is to Google some utility comparison websites to find a good deal. Take a couple if days to shop around. They will ask for your address and typical usage. You won't know your typical usage yet, so they will allow you to make an educated guess based on size, heating method, cooking frequency etc. It won't be perfect but it'll do to get you started and get some quotes. Note that you will probably have no choice when it comes to water. That's just the fucked up way it is.

Once you choose your provider(s) and deals, call each of them up to start your account. Here is where they will need the starting meter readings that you took earlier. Your usage and bills from now on will be calculated starting from that reading. Anything used before that will be billed to the previous tenant or the landlord or just written off, so don't worry about that. You can pay in many different ways to suit your income structure. Direct debit is the most hassle free and generally also give you a slight discount.

You're done! Every now and then, they'll remind you to take a meter reading to update your usage profile and bills.

&gt;The pack of hounds are controlled and directed by the huntsman as they attempt to locate and then follow the scent left by a fox. The huntsman is assisted by a whipper-in who helps control the pack and collects up stray hounds. A hunted fox will naturally run to the nearest holes familiar to it, but these are often blocked the night before the hunt  forcing the fox to run as far and as fast as it can. If a fox manages to find refuge in an open hole, the huntsman is likely to call for the terrier men (literally a man with a terrier specially trained to locate the fox underground and fight/hold it at bay. The fox is then dug out and shot or bolted from its underground refuge by the terrier and hunted again by the hounds that are waiting nearby.

&gt;For foxes chased and caught above ground, hunting enthusiasts claim that the first hound to reach the fox gives it a 'nip to the back of the neck' to kill it instantly. However, dogs which hunt in packs tend to bring down their prey by a series of bites and tears to the animal’s sides and hind quarters . This claim of a humane, quick death also ignores the suffering brought about by the deliberately prolonged chase.

3) If you look at the results, no party got close to what they were entitled to. If it were to be the same as the New Zealand system, 60% of the seats would be electorates.

What is different between SNP and Plaid is: SNP are making headway because Labour alienated the Scottish people and Plaid have not clicked that the Welsh people may want a voice - but they do not want Independence like the SNP found out last September.

Look at the debates on TV... Leanne talked over other people when they were saying their piece while the UKIP guy just stood there quiet until spoken too. Something I don't like about politics is their inability to take turns and just give each other a chance to speak. It's not a bitching contest its the future of our people.

Plaid... It's not just jumping the gun its that I'm not sure what they're offering Welsh Labour do not... I would like to see a bigger turn back towards Welsh culture... ultimately our culture brought us down - the Princes and Kings broke their land equally between their sons and it cost them Wales. That equality. Women also had more rights in Wales than most other nations in Europe... and this was 1200... That's something we should probably be proud of in our defeat - or maybe slumber is a better word.

They don't debunk every paper in the article, they are very critical, have said current works have helped better understand the mechanisms of things better and research should continue. 

When I said they think its worth they research you said they don't but they observe trials, in the article it says...

&gt;A handful of other clinical trials of cannabinoids are currently being set up. We are helping to support the only two UK trials of cannabinoids for treating cancer, through our Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre (ECMC) Network funded by Cancer Research UK and the devolved Departments of Health. One early-stage trial is testing a synthetic cannabinoid called dexanabinol in patients with advanced cancer, and the other is an early-stage trial testing a cannabis extract called Sativex for treating people with glioblastoma multiforme brain tumours. [Edited to add more information about the trials – KA 22/08/12, KA 24/03/14]

and then this...

&gt;Cancer Research UK has funded research into cannabinoids, notably the work of Professor Chris Paraskeva in Bristol investigating the properties of cannabinoids as part of his research into the prevention and treatment of bowel cancer. He has published a number of papers detailing lab experiments looking at endocannabinoids as well as THC, and written an interesting review looking at the potential of cannabinoids for treating bowel cancer.


and then again...


&gt;We support the only two UK clinical trials of cannabinoids for treating cancer through our national network of Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, funded by Cancer Research UK and the devolved Departments of Health. One is an early-stage trial testing a synthetic cannabinoid called dexanabinol for people with advanced cancer, the other is an early-stage trial testing a drug called Sativex (an extract from cannabis plants) for people with glioblastoma multiforme brain tumours. [Added 22/08/12 – KA, Updated KA 25/03/14]


I followed the links to the trials, one seems to be running and accepting applicants, the other running pending results.  Have you knowledge from uni of these, or how these are going or have turned out (genuine question)?


I never made the claim that cannabis cures cancer just that the research into chemicals in the plant looked promising and was worth continuing, and cancer research do seem to be involved in that. 

Similar to the epilepsy, my initial link to the Charlotte's web wiki page was just carelessly dropped in at the end of my post but I never made any claim beyond it being in trial stage after promising initial results in the USA. The articles were only published end of last year suggesting the trials were starting/in the early stages would it not be a fair guess to say they are either still under way or over pending results?  What would the normal time frame for this sort of thing be?

Conservatives are a far right party.

If you polled the people that voted for every single other party and asked who they wanted to get into power the least, the answers they would give you would be UKiP and conservative. 

That's because they're parties on the right. Whereas Labour, LibDem, Green, SNP, and so on are all parties on the left. They all have an affinity with one another that is significantly higher than that of parties on the right.

In essence, there are significantly more people that do not want right wing politics. The problem is that there are significantly more left wing parties, so left wing votes are split amongst the numerous different options while right wing voters have two choices - conservatives or UKiP. But, let's bear in mind that most of the UKiP vote base are working class people that wouldn't support the conservatives if UKiP did not exist to vote for, so without UKiP existing they wouldn't be a conservative vote, mostly..",null,0,null,1431137090,null,0,false,0,cr37gnc,null,t3_35a56k,null,t1_cr37gnc,null,t1_cr31713,null,null,null,1432855173,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null
null,false,SandCatEarlobe,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire,null,"Hunting on horseback with a full pack hounds is relatively inefficient as a means of fox reduction. A good scenthound, a terrier, and a gun is more efficient.

It is also seen as cruel, because the fox usually works out what's up in time to try to flee and because the dogs don't always manage to kill the fox as quickly as they're meant to - a good bite to the neck is faster than your average bullet, but a bad one leaves the fox enough time conscious to feel what the dogs do next.

Those are both fair points, but there are also a large number of anti-hunt people who oppose it for less valid reasons. 

There are people, for instance, who seem to think that foxes should not be killed at all, that they are not vermin or predators and opportunistic killers of small livestock and wild birds, that humans have been the only predator of the fox for centuries and in that time have been the part of the food web that has kept their numbers low enough that their prey are not destroyed. They seem to feel humans should recuse ourselves from nature.

Then you have people who seem to think that because foxes are adorable, they must be all right. This group is usually fairly young, and has so far managed to avoid seeing or dealing with the aftermath of a fox invading a hen house, and contains a higher proportion of vegans than the general population.

That being said... I believe that Steven Moffat has severely crippled the series with his character development. It's gotten to the point where, apart from the Doctor and Rory, I don't *care* about any of the other characters.

Moffat has repeatedly failed at writing female characters. He makes them all the same cardboard cut outs - sassy, flirty, arrogant - and the equation never really changes. Not only that, the female characters he favors the most turn into Mary Sue perfect characters (I'm looking at you, River Song), who blatantly go against the Doctor's ethical beliefs (such as using weapons), which was the staple of his character in many ways.

Not only that, but the Doctor's companions this time around don't really have a life outside of traveling with the Doctor. Sure, Amy and Rory went through certain aspects of their home life, but that wasn't until much later in the series. 

**For me, Doctor Who was always about taking these ordinary people and turning them into something extraordinary:**

Rose dropped out of high school and was looking forward to a *luxurious* life of retail with a mother that changes relationships like last night's underwear before the Doctor came around and showed her what life could be really like.

Martha, for all my issues with her googly eyes at the Doctor, might have had a better thing going - being in medical school and becoming a doctor herself - but it seemed that she had some serious family issues that she couldn't escape from. Going with the Doctor created even more care and adoration for her family, and eventually brought them together.

Donna was going nowhere in her life, following the same routine and feeling worthless about it. The Doctor came and showed her that she could be worth so much more, despite everything that happened.

**The moral choices that come with traveling with the Doctor, and the internal conflict that comes with choosing between him and their home life is one of the things that I could relate to the most.** As bad as the plot writing for the first four seasons might have been at times, no one can deny that RTD was a far superior showrunner in terms of character development and emotional attachment.

In Moffat's run, I feel none of that. We briefly get snippets of Amy and Rory's life, but otherwise we hear next to nothing and it creates an emotional gap that I could never cross - to the point where I felt nothing when Amy and Rory's companionship came to an end. 

In this instance, my attachment to the show has dwindled, even though ever fiber of my beings wishes it wouldn't. 

In my honest opinion, Steven Moffat needs to go.

It says I should quote you.

&gt;Our problem in the UK is that if we go for PR, then we don't have local representation - and we already had a, er, democratic vote on whether people wanted AV, and they didn't.

That's all one sentence. That indicates the two statements are related. If that's not what you meant, blame your own grammar.

No, it isn't. When 4.7% of the country get 8.6% representation in parliament, while 24.3% of the country get 1.6% representation in parliament and another 30.4% of the country get 35.7% representation in parliament? Fuck recognisable, there's zero semblance of equality whatsoever.

No, you aren't going to include every single person in the country, but you can include every single *vote* in the country and that's required for democracy.

&gt;Unless it's being used to illustrate how influence exists even when it's not direct.

You honestly think it's remotely close? You think that such a pathetic level of representation comes *remotely* close to due representation?

A research paper produced by the Libraries of both Houses and by the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology:](http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/key-issues-for-the-new-parliament/security-and-liberty/from-the-human-rights-act-to-a-bill-of-rights/)**

&gt;The Human Rights Act (HRA) was introduced in 1998 to “bring rights home”.  Essentially, it allows UK nationals to rely on rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights before the domestic courts.

&gt;The legislation has not been universally popular.  Some have branded it a “criminals’ charter”, following suggestions that it had been abused by various litigants.  In 2006 Tony Blair complained that a judgment about a group of Afghans who had hijacked a plane was an “abuse of common sense”. The judgment was later upheld on appeal.

&gt;Such cases have fed concern that the courts are becoming more “activist” and involved in dealing with “small p” political questions that would previously have been settled by politicians and administrators. Some political figures have criticised the way in which the courts have dealt with an increase in public law (judicial review) and human rights cases. There sometimes appears to be a tension between the principles of the supremacy of Parliament and the rule of law, exacerbated by extensive commentary on the Act. This has resulted in friction in policy areas such as asylum, immigration and counter-terrorism.

&gt;The Conservatives have further argued that the current legislation has created a culture of “risk aversion” among public authorities. In 2006 a Government-sponsored review of the operation of the Act stated that it had been bedevilled by misconceptions and had sometimes been “misapplied”. The Government also acknowledged that a series of damaging myths about the Act had taken root in the popular imagination.

&gt;Human Rights and Parliament

&gt;Ministers who bring primary legislation before the House of Commons are currently required to produce a “statement of compatibility” indicating whether or not the Bill is in conformity with the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights.
Parliament’s Joint Committee on Human Rights also considers the human rights compatibility of legislation, although it does not have any right to veto it.

&gt;Towards a new Bill of Rights?

&gt;In 2007 the Labour Government began to consult on building on the Human Rights Act to create a Bill of Rights. Other political parties have also called for a Bill of Rights. There are consequently various models for such a document, each of which has a significantly different meaning.

&gt;Building on the Human Rights Act?

&gt; Some have suggested that wider economic, social and environmental rights could be added to a British Bill of Rights, though it may be that all concerned would prefer that decisions regarding taxation and resource distribution remained matters for elected governments rather than the courts.

&gt;Labour mooted the possibility of introducing specific “duties” or “responsibilities” that would sit alongside the rights already guaranteed, such as the duty to obey the law and pay taxes, though, as some fundamental rights are absolute and not subject to “good behaviour”, it is not clear whether such responsibilities could be given legal effect in legislation.

&gt;Replacing the Human Rights Act?

&gt;Some have argued that the HRA does little to protect historic constitutional rights and liberties, such as the right to trial by jury or free speech. The Conservatives have suggested a new Bill of Rights to replace the HRA.  Exactly how this would operate in practice in relation to the European Convention on Human Rights is unclear, though the Conservatives have indicated that they would seek a greater national “margin of appreciation” in how the rights were applied in a domestic context.

&gt;While it seems unlikely that the UK would opt out of the European Convention on Human Rights, if the HRA were repealed and the Convention rights were no longer contained in UK law, aggrieved parties might once again have to take their case to the Strasbourg court for determination. Moreover, depending on the funding available (through legal aid or otherwise), parties might find it less easy to bring rights-related proceedings.

&gt;There are also certain devolution issues which would need to be overcome if the HRA were to be repealed.  How would a new Bill apply in Northern Ireland, which has been working towards its own rights framework?  Would the Scotland Act 1998 need to be amended, as currently the Scottish Parliament cannot pass legislation which is incompatible with the HRA?

&gt;A new constitutional framework?

&gt;A Bill of Rights might also be brought forward together with a new written constitution.  This could entrench constitutional legislation and allow the courts to rule legislation unlawful.  Gordon Brown raised the possibility that such a document might be published in time for the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta in 2015.  Creating such a new constitutional framework would need to be achieved with political consensus in order to be sustainable in the long term, but also perhaps with public involvement.  One criticism of the HRA has been that the public has felt no ownership of the legislation.  There have been suggestions for a “citizens’ convention” to formulate or debate proposals before they are put to the country in a referendum.

&gt;Commentators and Non-Governmental Organisations involved in the Bill of Rights debate (whatever their views of the 1998 Act) look upon it as an opportunity to gain public support for a new constitutional settlement.  Most recognise that while the HRA may have had a substantial influence on UK law, it has not found popular support amongst the general public and has been subject to sustained criticism by parts of the press",null,0,null,1431140741,null,0,false,0,cr39a09,null,t3_35cejr,null,t1_cr39a09,null,t1_cr38tlh,null,null,null,1432856100,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

&gt;__McVitie's__ is a British snack food brand owned by [United Biscuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Biscuits). The name derives from the original Scottish biscuit maker, McVitie &amp; Price, Ltd., established in 1830 on Rose Street in [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh), [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland). The company moved to various sites in the city before completing the St. Andrews Biscuit Works factory on Robertson Avenue in the [Gorgie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgie) district in 1888.  The company also operates two large manufacturing plants south of the border in [Levenshulme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshulme), [Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester) / [Heaton Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaton_Chapel), [Stockport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockport) and [Harlesden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlesden), [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London).

When I was younger racist wankers forced me to eat pork cause ""it would stop me from going to Heaven"". 

I was Hindu and at the time vegetarian. They thought I was Muslim. Whenever someone says ""anti-Islamic sentiment"" has no relationship to racism, I remember begging the older kids that I wasn't Muslim. But as you know? What's the difference right? 

It was, to put it mildly, very disturbing. Oh it didn't affect me. I don't have PTSD or whatever bullshit anyone who defends this tries to use to denigrate. I don't use Tumblr. 

You must remember that for me it would be like you being forced to eat horse or dog. You consider bacon to be edible and have no revulsion to it because of your culture. But you think dog, horse, goats are not as edible. Despite a huge chunk of the world considering insects as food you think they are not. Historically? Indians have revolted against British rule dying by the million not to be forced to touch beef or pork. Is it stupid? Maybe. But you have arbitrary restrictions based on culture too.

I am an atheist. I eat meat these days. I eat beef, but I only started eating meat when I was 13 after my Grandfather had to change his diet due to renal failure (to counter act protein loss). But I never ate pork. Not until I was 24. I had my first bacon sandwich by myself then because it was the only thing available. Until then bacon was always associated with violence and force. 

That's why its a hate crime. No white people have ever died because they refused to eat dog. And if this attack was carried out on Jews, it would have been a clear hate crime. It's excused. 

My mother was veggie so I was veggie. My grandmother swapped from non-vegetarian to veggie. However in her culture insects and dog and pretty much any animal (except cow) is food. Our big worldwide dish are those fried tarantula you have seen people eat on travel shows. 

Imagine being force fed that. 

That's the kind of revulsion a Muslim has to pork. Only worse cause it isn't JUST an illogical fear of a food that is alien to you but also religious admonishments.

null,false,back-in-black,english,England,null,"Labour's record on the economy was shockingly bad the last time they held power. There is absolutely no way they can be trusted until they admit their mistakes and illustrate how they can be avoided in the future. You can't do Keynesian economics and ignore the bit where you have to pay down debt during a boom, and our debt is astonishingly [high](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_debt). The fact that they increased spending to truly *insane* levels during the boom only makes sense in the light of the fact that they thought they'd eliminated the boom and bust cycle. If they genuinely believed that, then they're fools, and if they didn't, then they are the worst kind of liars - people willing to sell out our long term future in return for a short term political gain. Neither possibility makes them attractive as a party, especially given that there will be another crash, sooner or later, and Labour always seem to spend us further into the black hole and never in the other direction. How much are we paying on interest on the debt now? Is it 1 billion per week? That was the last number I encountered, and it only seems to increase. I'd rather not have my savings devalued to the point where they're worthless, thanks.

Frankly, the fact that they were so awful last time and seemed to have *no clue* this time around was the biggest factor for me. I mean, Miliband said he ""forgot"" to talk about the deficit in one of his key speeches. Really? He ""forgot""? Jesus.. 

The Conservatives record on the economy is *good enough*. We're improving at a decent rate, even if it's not what they'd hoped for initially, and frankly I don't trust Labour not to fuck it all up if they take office.

On other matters, both parties have been disappointingly authoritarian in their own unique way, so as far as I'm concerned that's something we have to fight no matter who is in power. The Lib Dems seemed to be a moderating factor on the Conservative right, and I shared many of their views, I'm disappointed that they're no longer part of the picture. 

My wife has also worked for the NHS for almost 20 years. She saw the way it went under Labour, and its far from the rosy picture that's been painted elsewhere. I don't trust Labour on the NHS either. I'm certainly not buying the OMG-Tories doom-and-gloom scenarios that have been painted by those on the left when it comes to public services. 

Lastly.. the Conservatives were the only main party that were offering a referendum on the EU, and really I think this needs to be done, for better or for worse. I find the attitude of some of our political class on the left - that the general public can't be trusted to vote in the ""right"" way, to be patronising in the extreme, and worse still, I think this ""just ignore it"" approach simply knocks the problem down the road rather than addressing it immediately.

You think that...

As a man that works in marketing I strongly disagree. And if you think that the marketing campaigns put on by the various parties didn't strongly influence the outcomes you're very very sadly mistaken.

I also guarantee that you and a strong proportion of this subreddit didn't vote on policy alone, strongly influenced by a marketing message that spoke to you.

It's not all about policies. Far from it. Conservatives played a much better game this time around. Ed's boys fucked it, they tried to use American election marketing tactics with a British audience and it didn't work(used Obama's debate coach for one example).

It's a good marketing lesson, what works in one country does not necessarily work in another country.

The Internet is secure enough for online banking and sales but not online voting? The problem is not with digital voting, the problem is with using proprietary voting machines instead of an open source website that can be used on your own devices.

How does allowing me to enter my voting details into a secure website increase the scope for fraud? Could somebody copy those details and use them to vote in my name? Sure, but they can already do that at a polling station. Could the website be hacked and voters details be stolen? Sure, but those details are obviously already stored on another computer system and that data could be obtained today by hacking that other system.

On the other hand, a 100% online voting system could be significantly less expensive, far easier to audit, have real-time counting and would almost certainly increase the number of people actually voting.

Right now it forces the courts to interpret legislation in 3 ways: ""reading in"" – inserting words where there are none in a statute; ""reading out"" where words are omitted from a statute; and ""reading down"" where a particular meaning is chosen to be in compliance with the HRA.

The courts are hesitant to make any strong decisions in fear of being seen as political and we all live in this uncomfortable state of limbo or purgatory where there's no clear idea where the courts powers start and end. I'd rather live in a world where I either know if the courts are toothless or are worryingly powerful rather in one where I sort of think/assume/hope that they may have some power but may not/may not be allowed to exercise it. 

We need a clear declaration of either yes judicial branch you have the right to intervene, we need a strong judicial check and balance or no we're committed to this great idea of parliamentary sovereignty, we believe our executive branch is responsible and making it clear we don't believe in a politicized, unelected judiciary with more power than it should have is a good thing, how dare you try to overstep your mark like that, bad supreme court.

I don't really have the time to type out anything more verbose or eloquent but wikipedia of all places does a fairly decent roundup of some of the problems from both sides of the argument (those that think s. 3 goes too far and those that think it doesn't go far enough) that i'll post below. 

I'm not here to engage in a nuts &amp; bolt plan for a BoR but I do think what we have in the HRA is deeply flawed and I do think any sort of proper reform would takes years - maybe even a decade and require broad consensus across the political spectrum and legal sector from the law commission to scholars to all other major stakeholders. I just think it's a conversation worth having and an arduous and long journey to reform that only the Tories have demonstrated the political will for. 

[As promised:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_3_of_the_Human_Rights_Act_1998)

&gt;Before the Human Rights Act was brought before parliament, the government's whitepaper considered that it was necessary to prevent courts from setting aside legislation on the basis of incompatibility (reflecting a strong need to respect parliamentary sovereignty).[24] However, the effect on parliamentary sovereignty has been criticised despite the safeguards put in place. Section 3 has been defended, however, by reference to the enhanced morality and constitutionalism of the new system, prompted by an ""incoming tide"" of human rights.[25] Aileen Kavanagh considers the choice of a court in cases not a question of parliamentary sovereignty, but a complex question of how far the judiciary can perform a legislative function in that area.[26] She considers the political and legislative pressure on government after section 3 or 4 overwhelming to the extent that the concept of parliamentary sovereignty should be ""eliminated"". However, other writers have stressed the important of the formal right to ignore either decision.[26] The result of this debate has been to label section 3 either a ""radical tool"" to implement human rights, or a ""signficiant limitation"" of Parliament's will.[27]

&gt;Geoffrey Marshall has characterised section 3 as a ""deeply mysterious provision"" in several respects, including judging how strong a provision it is – an issue since dealt with by the courts – but has also noted a seemingly disparaty between what the Act might be expected to do and what it does. He argues that a litigant would hope that courts would strive to uphold his rights under the Convention, accepting a derivation from them only rarely; instead section 3 requires courts to find compatibility with the Convention where possible – in other words, to strive to find that the Convention does not impact the claimant.[28] Alison L. Young has examined the upper boundaries to courts' powers of interpretation. She puts forward three possible limits: firstly, where the text of a statute is not ambiguous; secondly, where reading in words is inappropriate; and, thirdly, where any interpretation is restricted to cases where it does not involve implied repeal. Young dismisses the first two as incompatible with the legislative history (and, in at least the first case, judicial history) and believes the third to present no rigid limit on courts' powers at all. The decision of Pepper v Hart provides a method for the legislative history of a bill to play a role in its interpretation.[29]

&gt;Philip Sales and Richard Ekins are among those that believe that section 3 has not displaced the purpose of interpretation – to discern parliamentary intention. In their eyes, section 3 is about ""how interpreters are to infer that intention"". They also criticise the ""judicial lawmaking"" because it applies to the case in hand, concluding that this breaks the non-retroactivity commonly considered part of the rule of law, although it is sometimes necessary.[30] They also note that rules made by courts are not transparent, because their new interpretation under section 3 differs from their ordinary meaning – after all, section 3 must go beyond standard interpretation. This leaves citizens uncertain of what the law is.[30] Sales and Ekins also suggest that while applying section 3 to post-Human Rights Act legislation might be merely using a presumption that the legislature intended to follow it, applying it to pre-Human Rights Act legislation cannot possibly base itself on such an inference. Section 3, though, still allows them to do so.[30]

&gt;Another view is that Section 3 provides a much strengthened basis for the sort of ""weak review"" – the scope of which carefully determined between courts on one hand and parliament on the other – in a statutory form. There have been at least three criticisms put forward: firstly that the impossibility of implied repeal goes against some formulations of parliamentary sovereignty that require that no parliament can bind a future parliament. Secondly, whether section 3 interpretations follow parliamentary intent is questionable; thirdly, if it does allow interpretations contrary to intent, section 3 may render section 4 necessary. However, judicial powers are probably not unconstrained. The analysis of what the courts can and cannot do would also provide the answer the third criticism, depending on the viewpoint.[31] Whilst the scope of section 3 has been criticised for being vague, and leading therefore more easily to the imposition of the judiciary on the legal domain of parliament, this viewpoint is controversial: they do not seem to have yet so encroached and there are rules emerging about the application of section 3",null,1,null,1431153553,null,0,false,0,cr3e04r,null,t3_35cejr,null,t1_cr3e04r,null,t1_cr3a0w3,null,null,null,1432858327,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

While your qualms about the society here are well put, I think it is a bit unfair. The country is designed in a way that Arab blood have certain advantages over the immigrant population, but it is still a land of opportunity. There is a vast difference between the middle and lower classes in terms of lifestyle, wages, etc. but the lower classes are generally uneducated hailing from the rural parts of the Asia (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, etc.). Hundreds and thousands of educated immigrants enter the country each year and find jobs based on their merit. They are treated fairly and equally. In terms of Human Rights, UAE has made major changes to its treatment of the Labour class. I work closely in the construction industry and I can tell you that we are required to provide mandatory healthcare, food, accomodation and transport allowances for all our labours. The construction workers earn up to 10 times what they would back home and most do it out of necessity. The living conditions have vastly improved from the 90's as the government has constantly stepped up in this regard. Health and Safety standards have vastly increased in all big construction projects.

I am self-employed by choice, running a small business and doing consulting. I am not married but have been with my partner for 5 years. Most people my age stereotypically aren't in any of the above situations. I guess in someways I would be a Tory voter based on the above, but I voted Green. 

I think young people feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness and defeat. Jobs are scarce and most are zero hour contracts with poor pay and no progression. Further education has become a luxury. The cushioning of public services are being stripped away. Accommodation is becoming impossible to buy based on increased house prices, whilst rent is skyrocketing and power lies in the hands of landlords. Dreams are dashed, and any hope of getting into the career one wants is halted by extreme competition. 

Young people are also the biggest users of social media. I think this has left many people shocked - the overwhelming anti-Tory consensus on social media did not manifest itself in the way people voted, so whilst young people were sharing their Guardian articles and David Cameron memes with each other, the vast majority of UK voters had not yet spoken. 

I guess this combination of, as you said, dashed hopes and the Internet has led to a lot of people fearing for what will happen over the next 5 years.

Fair enough, there are a number of radically different alternative proposals floating around but my principal opposition is to this need for european oversight.

As far as actual nuts and bolts I believe a lot of renegotiating by the Tories will be necessary to allow us to both remain in the EU and curtail their powers. From what I gather DCam's going to try and gain a right for parliament to veto ECtHR judgements and generally curtail Strasbourg's influence.  Though it would take a long time to work through the ramifications - for instance it may result in a breach of the 1998 Good Friday agreement.

There will be no voting reform. We just had a referendum on AV and the country said no.

While we're on the subject, one of the major blows to the Yes to AV campaign (which I voted for) was Ed Miliband getting all haughty about sharing a platform with Nick Clegg. It made the Yes campaign look disarmed, disorganised, and a total farce.

I'll revise whatever I send you when I get up early in the morning tomorrow for a job interview because yay..............

I think I put this in the post, but in my essay for AVFTB I wrote about [McCarthyism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism). I can't remember the structure too terribly well for the WJEC board, but I'm fairly certain that you get to choose from 2 questions and to answer one.. Anyway - I answered the one about the symbolism of the bridge, or something like that. I linked the bridge to McCarthyism. This is the shit that examiners **love**. It isn't *just* authorial context, but it's social **and** historical **at the same time**. Furthermore, it shows that you've done further reading and have well versed yourself within the subject matter, so they know that you're going to be able to argue your point and, of course, this will all be credited for. It also leaves a good impression on the examiner and, essentially, English exams are just playing with the examiner's mind and making them *want* to give you high marks. If you lead in with something huge and, in my opinion, advanced as that then you're giving them a mindset that would make them think ""shit, this kid knows what he's talking about. I bet his other points will be great too.. ~tick~"". So you have both of those things going for you. 

I think another interesting thing to link into AVFTB is how controversial it is. You could link this argument after the bridge one (or before, up to you) and then argue that because Eddie has sexual attractions to Catherine (please excuse me if I get the names mixed up) then that would make an audience feel.. Disturbed. Again - think about the reader's intention. However - is it *really* disturbing? I mean.. She isn't blood related; Catherine is Beatrice's sister's daughter (that sounds like a start of an awful joke..) so could you argue that it isn't incest? Giving your point of view on something and arguing against the typical convention will always be a **huge** advantage. I'm not sure if you've looked at the assessment objectives (AOs), but in A level English, you're given marks for giving different interpretations (AO3). 

Which leads me very nicely onto my next point - check out the AOs and make sure what the percentage weights are. Going back to A level (the exam board is AQA, if that's any help. The GCSE marking might be somewhat similar to A level in principle). Someone else in the comments mentioned ""PETER L"", I think it was. Make sure to use that amazing technique, devised by yours truly. 

As for A Christmas Carol, I suppose the points are the same (just don't write about McCarthyism..) you have themes of Christmas, which are generally quite happy, and then you have Scrooge who is very mean and whatnot. Something quite reassuring about the English literature exams is the fact that even if you don't know *everything* you can still get an admirable grade - as long as you know how to argue your point. Someone in my class last year, talking about AVFTB, said ""Well, Eddie is a turtle.. It doesn't once say that he isn't in the play."" He has his evidence and he therefore has a point (of course, that's not something that you could write in the exam, but I hope you understand what I'm trying to get at). 

I hope this answered your question. I could go through both texts in great detail, but that would probably take ages. If you have any other specific questions about exam technique or the books, feel free to PM me.

&gt;__McCarthyism__ is the practice of making accusations of subversion or treason without proper regard for evidence. It also means ""the practice of making unfair allegations or using unfair investigative techniques, especially in order to restrict dissent or political criticism.""  The term has its origins in the period in the United States known as the [Second Red Scare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Scare#Second_Red_Scare_.281947.E2.80.931957.29), lasting roughly from 1950 to 1956 and characterized by heightened [political repression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_repression) against [communists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism), as well as a [campaign spreading fear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_mongering) of their influence on American institutions and of [espionage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage) by [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) agents. Originally coined to criticize the [anti-communist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-communist) pursuits of [Republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States\)) [U.S. Senator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate) [Joseph McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy) of [Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin), ""McCarthyism"" soon took on a broader meaning, describing the excesses of similar efforts. The term is also now used more generally to describe reckless, unsubstantiated accusations, as well as [demagogic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogy) attacks on the character or patriotism of political adversaries.

The internet is to all intents and purposes a public place.

(and lets not get started on what your bank and supermarket know about you)

In isolation it's understandable that people would be concerned by government surveillance of their online activity, but in practice the government are only giving themselves access to the same data that private corporations *already have*. Alternatively, I guess, the government could just *buy* the data from the corporations?

The second thing to understand, is whether or not there is a genuine need for surveillance. That is, are there genuinely ""bad actors"" (terrorists, foreign ""spies"", organised criminals etc) living amongst us who do not have our countries best interests at heart and for whom the internet is a powerful *weapon* in their arsenal?

tl;dr The internet is a powerful weapon, it's a public place and it is surely used by ne're-do-wells of all kinds. It is important to deny such people unfettered access to such a powerful weapon. *Of course* some kind of government monitoring and oversight is required.

For example, if they break into a chicken shed, they will kill every last one and just take the one they want to eat. People like me who live and work in the country then have to go and deal with a shed full of ripped apart birds. 

It would be awful not to have foxes in the countryside, but there's far too many of them and since the hunting ban numbers of them have increased. Their numbers need to be controlled. 

Nature can be cruel and as humans we have a habit of humanising everything. Hunting with dogs is one of the oldest and most natural form of hunting.

3) Failure to address the idea, a myth or not, that Labour's spending caused a banking crisis

&gt; They aren't going to put every disabled person in the UK out on the street to rot.... these guys aren't monsters no matter what the radical left would like you to believe.

The Tories refuse to announce their plans, and Tory voters therefore don't know what they have just voted for. It seems pretty clear to me some of these cuts are going to be horrific otherwise they would have said what they were before the election.

The 3 biggest working age benefits are housing benefit, employment and support allowance and disability living allowance. Around half of working age benefits, where the £12 billion cuts have to come from, are disability related, and housing benefit is needed so that people have somewhere to live.

I'd love to believe you that they Tories aren't monsters, that they aren't going to leave the disabled out in the street.

And Labour's biggest mistake in my view was letting them set the agenda like this - when someone attacks him for the leadership stuff, just come out and ask why they think the older brother automatically has the right to be leader as if it's some kind of hereditary position. With the bacon sandwich stuff, he only needed to look to Farage to see how to cope with looking like a tit in photos. Embrace it - if people are turned off by slick politicians, show that you're not one of them. Instead, like Gordon Brown, he clearly listened to Labour's media consultants and tried to become as slick as Blair, which was never going to work, and instead ended up often looking more fake than Cameron.

Similarly, when people started claiming that England would be ruled over by Scotland if Labour had to go into coalition with the SNP, don't start distancing yourself from them. Just point out that it's a British election and the Scots have just as much right to be part of ruling it as English people do. The Tories weren't scared of alienating the entirety of Scotland because they knew they'd got pretty much no chance there, but Labour could have built on this by highlighting that this is exactly how the Tories treat those who aren't part of their target demographic - demonising and despising them.

RB: Danilo (certainly won't happen). I am not sure what will happen to Wisdom. I suspect a new deal for Flanagan but if Manquillo and Johnson both leave then the club will look for a new 

RB. If Rodgers remains as manager it is not out of the question that Ibe may be tried in a wing back role. Alternative is that Manquillo stays and RB is no longer a priority. The likes of Adriano and Alves have been mentioned by agents as possible options but such players will be expensive and are unlikely to end in anything but tears. Folks, I assume because of something in the press, have been asking about Janmaat moving to Liverpool. I don't know of interest but I am pretty sure Newcastle would not want to sell.

LB: Sam Byram has been watched.

CB: A new deal has been offered to Toure and he will be considering his options. I doubt a CB is a priority - at least not before the club clear out some of those already on the books (Skrtel, Lovren, Sakho, Ilori, Coates, Paez, Lloyd Jones and Kolo Touré).

MF: I understand from an ex-German international that Liverpool have watched Lars Stindl on more than one occasion this season but he has decided to reject the interest of Liverpool and will move to Borussia Mönchengladbach in the summer. Milner, Khedira (looking very, very, very unlikely), Pjanic (outrageously expensive), Vazquez. Even though he has very recently extended his contract, Inter are willing to sell Kovacic and have spoken with Arsenal, Liverpool and Hertha Berlin. Nikky Vuskan has said there has not been any approach to him from any club at this time and that whilst Inter may be willing to sell the player, Kovacic wants to stay at the club. Filipe Anderson has been watched but nothing will happen with Liverpool.

F/W: Ings, Vietto (probably not possible), Heung Min Son (as an alternative to Vietto). Gameiro, Baez (a WP would be an issue initially), Kishna (I understand that old interest has been rekindled but it is hard to see how he would fit in), Lacazette (not going to happen), and Liverpool have looked again at Firmino (can't see it happening). Two other players the club were interested in - Bakkali (I suspect Liverpool have stepped back from their interest like many other clubs) and Andre Ayew (a free agent who Liverpool enquired about last summer - no obvious interest right now but it may return). If Sterling were to leave then a move for Walcott may be on the cards, or perhaps Cheryshev - but no offer has been made.",null,0,null,1431162916,null,0,false,0,cr3g0vb,null,t3_35c2ff,null,t1_cr3g0vb,null,t3_35c2ff,null,null,null,1432859350,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

The Tories use to be the party of the rich (and still are) but they have some how managed to turn a lot of the general public against less fortunate people, playing up the cost of benefits. The recent propaganda sent out by the Tories showed 'welfare' spending as the highest proportion, however when you break it down, unemployment benefits were minimal and this included pensions, which is a type of welfare benefit but most people would not think of this and assume it's ""lazy people who can't be bothered to work"". Also a lot of their figures such as unemployment rates (lowest ever) is mainly due to the rise in zero-hour contracts and they have made claiming job seekers allowance so hard that people don't bother...

null,false,DaveChild,null,null,null,"You didn't bother to link to anything backing up those assertions, so I'm not going to spend time picking them apart. I am going to point out that you don't seem to understand the reasons for the austerity cuts, and there is one in particular that really should be better understood.

The government has to borrow money. Despite the 2000s being incredibly prosperous, we went into the recession with obscene debt, and recession means both that our ability to pay that debt is reduced and that we have to borrow more and more to keep the country's services going.

That money comes from one of two places. We either print it (which is bad) or we borrow it from other countries and investors. Those investors have plenty of choice about where to place their money, or whether to lend to any particular country. And in the case of a country in recession, they are understandably nervous.

That lending happens in the form of bonds, where the government offers X billions of pounds of bonds. It's similar to a bank loan - you get money now and pay it back with interest later.

So, the government of that country usually does its best to make sure that those investors have confidence. The government reduces spending, introduces belt-tightening measures and so on. All to increase confidence in their ability to repay those bonds. Failure to sell all the bonds offered is pretty worrying for investors, by the way. We have even bought our own bonds, if you can believe it - lending money to ourselves to make it look like our bond market is strong!

If we fail to sell our bonds, we can't borrow money, and the country is pretty much fucked. Can't pay pensions, can't pay NHS salaries, can't pay the police, or the fire service, or the army. Can't pay pensions, housing benefit, disability benefit or other welfare. We'd have to print money to do all of that, and then you have potentially disastrous inflation as well as screwing over your previous investors, making future borrowing even harder.

There's a balance, sure, between austerity for confidence and public spending to prompt growth. But I reckon it's probably better that the people who actually deal with the bond markets (and are better placed to understand how close we are to that state of being unable to borrow) are making that decision.",null,0,null,1431163800,null,0,false,0,cr3g6u7,null,t3_359oqh,null,t1_cr3g6u7,null,t1_cr2n8mf,null,null,null,1432859428,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I only say because it says 'the driver of 'your' vehicle was responsible. This suggests that it may come from the representatives of the other vehicle in the accident. 

Did you hire through a big national firm? Enterprise or someone? If so, and this might be totally wrong, but It's highly possible that Enterprise (for example) have also been instructed to provide a hire car to the other vehicle involved in the accident's driver, and this letter is from what is effectively the third party seeking recovery of their losses (having not realised that the same company have had an involvement for both parties). If it did turn out that this was the case you should just be able to ring up the hire company under your reference, as opposed to the one for the other vehicle and tell them that their two departments need to speak to each other. I would start by checking that the registration of the vehicle that they have charged you for replacement of, is the vehicle that you hired.

null,false,Jedibeeftrix,null,null,null,"The media has been full of articles bemoaning the tribal nature of the tories, and how the eveil right wing media deceived the (lumpen) proletariat. The presumption is that I might be slightly misguided; a basically decent chap led astray by the right wing media, tempted to vote for the tories, yet in ignorance of their many failings.

That isn’t even close. I am not a slightly dull tory, voting blindly in faith despite the many failings that should be apparent. I am not a tory, rather I am generically right wing. I want small government.

What does that mean? For me, it means spending less than 40% of GDP, and not flooding day to day life with a million regulations ‘guiding’ me down the approved path of life. As a negative-liberty kind of kind of guy (pace Isaiah Berlin), I see a greater threat to liberty from government through its two primary tools (tax and law), than I do from being free to starve in the desert. You may disagree, that is your privilege. Orthogonally to the question left/right question, I also believe in:

1. an activist foreign policy, with the military means and the public backing to conduct the messy jobs in international relations. Not just another aid power like japan, or a soft power like Germany, occasionally someone needs to do the dirty jobs.

2. Parliamentary sovereignty, and the sovereignty of parliament (not the same thing). There is no such thing as fundamental rights, there is no tablet of stone with the writ of humanity inscribed, there are only things that society deems important and that is best enacted and protected in parliament. Likewise, I wish to see Parliament free to enact law as it deems fit as representative of the (British) people, and so reject the transfer of fundamental sovereignty elsewhere.

These are not strictly right-wing or tory, but they are ideas that are most closely held by the right. I want spending at less than 40% of GDP, more than 2.0% spent on defence, less than 1% given to the EU, and do whatever good can be most sensibly achieved with the rest. Which of course includes public services and social benefits. Oh, and I want a bonfire of law and regulation, starting with the absurdity expressed by the need to transport tolley’s tax guide in a wheelbarrow, and likewise the restrictions on public conduct. I don’t live in a continental consensual social democracy, and nor do I want it. I like our adversarial political system, and I prefer our market economy to rhine capitalism, French dirigisme, or Nordic collectivism. I know exactly what I want.

While we are on the subject of my callous disregard for the lamentations of the afflicted and dispossessed, it’s worth making the point that I see this as a question of compound interest… or compound growth to be precise. There is research to suggest that other factors withstanding (making cross comparison between nations essentially futile), the smaller a government is the fast it will grow. Again, this is economics so nothing is hard and fast (barely deserving the title of ‘science’ in fact), but rough figures suggest that between spending levels of 35% of GDP and 50% of GDP every five percentage point increase in spending reduces annual growth by point five percentage points. Year on year, every year thereafter. Other research suggest that the optimal size of government to maximise growth is around 40% of GDP for a large open economy. An advanced western economy, facing relative technological and demographic decline, should not be spending more than 40% of GDP lest it do serious damage to the long-term growth rate that will preserve the standard of living we enjoy for our children too:

What this boils down to is the assumption that within 20 years my government spending 37.5% of GDP (with an average growth of 2.75%) will be spending in absolute terms a very similar amount to your government spending 42.5% of GDP (with an average growth of 2.25). The difference is in your scenario the next twenty years sees more spending, where in mine every single years beyond that for the rest of time sees higher spending. That means more benefits, more services, more defence, and more money left in peoples pockets. It isn’t just government revenue that benefits, it is everyone, and economic growth has done a better job of lifting billions out of poverty than every other measure combined.

So, you can't say ""we need more lgbt/females/black people/Muslims/Christians/whatever"" and put a program in place to bias selection towards such candidates, as you could in a company, as they need to be elected.

Even if you got cross party cooperation to agree only to run an lgbt 

candidate in a particular constituency, in order to ensure an lgbt candidate is selected (which would be a horrible abuse of democracy) then an independent could run and win.

Going ""ooh there are lots of lgbt people"" doesn't give you anyone to pat on the back as nobody hired them. It also risks defining those elected MPs by their sexual preference, which I think would be wrong.

It's a small step away from campaigning for LGBT people to all vote for the LGBT candidate so that they are represented (which is silly because you could have an LGBT BNP candidate) or stifling legitimate criticism of lgbt MPs or candidates on the grounds of discrimination, a bit like the tower hamlets mayor recently convicted who accused all his critics of racism.

null,false,GavinZac,irish,Tutorial Island,null,"&gt; It was right not to supply the Irish with support. Any simple agricultural lesson would immediately inform you that growing an entire nation off monoclonal crops is a death sentence.

&gt; How would they learn if they were supported in their ridiculous flawed actions? We would just see repeat after repeat after repeat from Irish agriculturalists who refused to update their views to the modern era and new technology that developed in the 19th and 20th centuries.

I wish I could say you are  astonishingly ill-informed, but I've had to cover this so many times it's not that much of a surprise any more:

*There was no shortage of food in Ireland, but there was a famine.*

* **How did that happen?**

[Because Ireland was a net exporter of food during The Famine](http://www.schillerinstitute.org/economy/nbw/pot_famine95.html). Much of this food was secondary, non-staple food you see, grown or produced for sale in England.

* **So why didn't they grow staple food?** 

Well, they did, with what land they could; the potato allowed them to actually grow enough food to feed 8 million people on the little land allotted to staple growth.

* **Well why didn't they allot more land to staple foods?**

Because the Irish didn't own the land. Through plantation, confiscation and shady business tactics, absentee landowners in Britain gained the majority of the suitable arable land in Ireland. They did not really care what was going on 'on the ground', focusing instead on making profits by selling cash crops and secondary products like butter in England, even while the Irish starved.

* **Why didn't the people in charge do anything about it?**

Because the person in charge, Charles Trevelyan, was of the opinion - like yourself, in a way - that the Irish were not being as productive as they should. He called the famine an act of god, and argued that the English should not reject the ""gift"" god had give them. He felt thinning the numbers would steel the Irish left over, and allow more room for immigration from Britain. That this 'unproductiveness' (read: uncooperativeness, and occasional revolt) was probably a result of the previous nearly 200 years of penal laws banning everything from learning their own language or using it in trade, to owning a horse lest they ride it in battle, seemed to escape him, nor did he seem to value the lives of those dying with stomachfuls of grass, people who were directly part of the United Kingdom, British subjects like any other in his country.

* **Wow, that's absurd! He must be a real villain. Did he get what was coming?**

For his efforts to prevent any real reaction to the famine, Trevelyan was knighted to the KCB while ships were still leaving Ireland with cash crops to the east and starving people to the west. He was later elevated to nobility with a baronetcy, and then in his elder years given the role of surveyor in India, touring the land to pick out nice, cool hilly areas upon which to build hill stations and residences for the British elite.

Any 'simple history lesson' would immediately inform you of that, but they don't teach much about what was a third of your 'home countries' at that time, do they?

Helmet prices typically only reflect the materials. Very expensive helmets can typically be carbon fibre (or special composites) which make them very light and very strong - that lightness is what you're paying for. Most £40 helmets will be made of plastics meaning they'll still protect your head no problem, but they might be a fair whack heavier (and potentially noisier).

I honestly think that if a helmet fits _properly_ and you're happy with the comfort, then that's the right one for you (ignoring price tag). I've put on £40 helmets that fit ok, but are incredibly uncomfortable after 5 minutes as they dig in at various places, and I've tried £900 ones where the sizes don't *quite* fit - the small is WAY too small and the next size up can be pulled straight off my chin when strapped up.

I expect you might have a point with regards to some riders not using a properly fitting helmet, but then that's down to the salesman, or down to ignorance on the part of the rider (no offence intended). If your helmet doesn't fit properly, it's not going to give you much protection in a crash!

---

NB by 'fitting properly' I mean no uneven pressure on your head, squeezes your cheeks in, doesn't wobble around and can't be pushed off when strapped up.

UKIP has been the only party to actually campaign to leave, but there are large amounts of backbench Tories, even backbench Labour MPs, and trade unions that want to leave.  It will not only be a UKIP platform campaigning to leave.  Once the referendum campaign is actually launched then backbenchers will be freed to express their support.

It is reported over two thirds of Conservative backbench MPs would be joining the Better Off Out campaign once a referendum campaign is officially launched.  They're being good little underlings at the moment and giving the leadership one last chance to prove negotiation is flawed.  Then you've got the Kate Hoeys from Labour and the Dennis Skinner types.

Secondly there is no meaningful reform in the UK sense.  They've already been told as much.  Juncker has politely said he'd listen but has ruled out fundamental change and review of existing treaties until 2019 - which is all but saying *'Not on my watch'*.

Meanwhile in giving them advance notice the pro-federalists in the EU are already moving to frame the referendum question between in and accepting federalism and out and free trade via an association agreement.

The IN option means federal EU taxes, giving up on a UK military for an EU army, giving up on a UK foreign service, consolidated debt, committing to joining the Euro, and a goal of a 'post-national Europe'.

The Out option means getting access to the single market for trade, getting out of the way of the federal agenda, and making our own policy,

Why did the national debt increase yes. 
 Yes there was a lot of hangover from the GFC which caused the deficit to increase, it was not caused primarily by welfare or a ""labour recession""  But the problems the Tories have is that GDP and GDP per capita was recovering post GFC in late 2009-2010 labour government, it tailed off and crashed when the Tories brought in Austerity which meant the TAX RECEIPTS the treasury was relying on to pay down the deficit collapsed as we were earning less (GDP per capita) and inflation was rising causing a drop in living standards.

The Government then had to borrow to make for the shortfall meaning an increased deficit, which is why they missed their own targets on deficit reduction and it accumulated and added to the national debt.

It does seem to highlight everything I disagree with about the right.

I see the left's position as ""let's protect the weak"", which I think is morally the correct option. So for me the way I vote is a moral decision you see, whereas perhaps for you it's strictly an intellectual? I've always seen the left as the champion of the common good over the personal, and the right as it's opposite (in the most simplistic terms), so I get angry (foolishly) when we lose because I've already made it an emotional choice.

I also think that in times of crisis people make decisions based on fear and therefore self-interest, and that are therefore more right wing. Which I think helped the Tories to their devastating victory. Do you agree at all? Have you always been a Tory voter? I'll reiterate, because I understand how this may come across, I am NOT having a dig. Just genuinely interested. Most of my friends are equally lefty so I don't get much chance for discourse with the enemy, as it were...

Reading the Labour manifesto right after finishing the Conservative manifesto was like a half-hour deja-vu.

Both had a few proposals to help low-paid workers through raising the minimum wage and cutting taxes, and if you ran the numbers they amounted to almost exactly the same amounts. Labour's only unique pro-worker proposal are a) an unclear ban on certain kinds of zero-hour contracts  and b) the removal of fees for employment tribunals, which is good but not exactly the rallying cry of the British working class.

The problem with Labour is that it's completely disconnected from the actual British working class; that its election manifesto talks much more about balancing the budget and helping out business than helping workers is a striking indicator.

It is worth noting that these newspapers are not all read by one person alone, many people will leave them lying around in cafes, canteens at work to be read by colleagues and taken home for wives girlfriends and children to read.
there is also the digital footprint, the daily mail alone is gargantuan with 189.5 million people visiting reading the online daily mail per MONTH. 
http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/20/mail-online-traffic-metro-standard-mirror

Obviously these are not all British, but it is definitely a sizable portion as its free. Which is added to the 1.78 million that buy the paper alone. 
 Only 11 million people voted for the Tories. More people watched the xfactor final than voted Tory.

What this tells us is that Your staement is wrong, that there are not vastly more people voting Tory than read Tory media, which is hopelessly and completely corrupt.

null,false,shebwabwa,null,null,null,"I'm genuinely interested in understanding this, so please read my questions / comments with that in mind:

Do you think that an unregulated banking system had anything to do with our recession? 

The reason I ask is because Osborne is reported to have borrowed more money in the last 3 years than Labour did in 13, and yet Labour have been successfully portrayed as being responsible for the recession because of their public spending - even though New Labour public spending policy was supported by the Tories until the end of 2008. I get the feeling that we've been sold the idea that we need to endure austerity, when there are numerous arguments that suggest public spending provides the stimulus needed to get the economy growing again.

Another thing that seems to be overlooked is corporation tax - I don't think that deficits are necessarily an issue on a macro-economic scale, but even if I'm mistaken and they are an issue, why not tax corporations effectively to reduce the deficit? Not doing so suggests that the Tories aren't really concerned with reducing the deficit at all, but are more concerned with providing economic advantages for those wealthy enough to wield influence.

Another thing I don't get is the Tory obsession with privatisation. To me it makes a mockery of democracy by placing crucial services in the hands of business - the price of said service inevitably rises to maximise profit, and it becomes impossible to choose an alternative. Some would say that we 'vote with our wallets', but if there are only limited options to choose from (whether you're catching a train, heating your home, or going to a hospital), is that really a choice?

I may be totally wrong here, so please don't take offence. I'm genuinely interested in understanding how a modern government deals with these issues (amongst others, such as the idea of endorsing infinite growth in the face of finite resources), and why a Tory government that seems to treat citizens with such contempt could ever be a good choice. I don't think Labour would have done a decent job in its current state, as its far too centrist to really tend to the concerns of our society. The Left is fractured and needs new champions, and I see their current state as an opportunity to re-form and find their soul again.

Anyway, I'd be interested to hear what you think about that.",null,0,null,1431169034,null,0,false,0,cr3h7at,null,t3_359uz4,null,t1_cr3h7at,null,t1_cr3bthk,null,null,null,1432859905,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,ozr3dditor,null,null,null,"Devil's advocate. The whole world knows Arsenal need a world class keeper and that's Petr Cech. The situation could get interesting if indeed De Gea were to make that move to Real to replace Casillas. Throw Lloris into the mix and we have potentially three clubs involved (Arsenal, United, Tottenham). We could easily be looking at £15-25M for him if there's multiple bids. It would be a good business opportunity for the club to profit from this transfer to help fund another backup keeper (Green, Begovic) plus additional funds for another big name signing (e.g. Pogba).






On a footballing sense, is it sensible to allow Cech to join a PL rival (Arsenal, United)? No at the immediate opinion because he will be the one stopping us and other teams from scoring, which means potentially challenging us for PL crown. It could also mean that Cech will be bringing with him knowledge about how our goal poachers score (e.g. Hazard's pens, Costa's runs, Remy's style of play, etc.). On the flip side, our team will also know Cech's weaknesses and attack him there if he were to say move to Arsenal. One I can think of is catching crosses coming in. So a Mourinho tactic against him then would be set pieces, strong bodies in the box, small players for the crumbs.







If Cech were to move to a European rival (e.g. Real), we could be seeing larger implications since we're more likely to go into a pen shootout against Real than Arsenal or United (unless if we unluckily meet them in the CL Semi/Final or local cups).

We're agreed on austerity: I do not believe  that this is the best course of action during a recession/weak recovery. However, saying that austerity reduced **GDP** (from memory) is not true. I believe GDP has been on an upward trend since 2010 - though this is worth verifying - what is instead very arguably true is that austerity reduced the level of GDP growth. 

Also, tax receipts and GDP are not so simply linked. In absolute terms, tax receipts have been increasing steadily since 2010 (after a period of consistent decline since the start of the GFC), though they've reduced a little bit as a percentage of GDP.

The point of the voting system is to downvote posts that do not contribute to discussion, its right there in the reddiquette, but it has never and will never be used for that purpose, its more of a ""i agree"" and ""you're wrong"" system.

So why is this a problem? Because people who may not have an opinion will be influenced by whoever is voted the highest and will not pay attention to opposing arguments, no matter how valid they might be, because its being down voted.

Sorry I forgot to post this.  I'm not attacking you, I think with access to the right data we will agree more than disagree. GDP per capita was beginning to rise post GFC untill the Budget cuts hit in late 2010, then fell dramatically prolonging the recession and crushing tax reciepts as people were put in the dole and turned into net tax drains rather than contributors, this all added to the rising Deficit as we had quite large budget obligations in welfare and NHS spending.
The Cuts also took money out of the economy, as it may seem like a saving but the private sector also relies on Public sector money.

All in all sucking money out of a fragile and only just recovering economy sucked demand and output out of the economy hurting its ability to sustain itself necessitating the need for the large deficit.

null,false,Carlswaen,null,null,null,"&gt;What do you think about the forthcoming EU referendum?

If Cameron wanted to stay in he should have negotiated behind the scenes last term and announced a snap referendum 6 months out.

Giving pro-federal forces several years warning of a referendum if he won a majority made them put contingency plans in place.

Pro-federal arguments, arguments that if the UK remains it must get on board, will assist the pro-exit argument and hinder the pro-EU argument.

&gt;What will be the terms of the referendum?

I'm sure Cameron will try a media-debate type coup and try to make it as biased as possible.  C'est la vie.

The EU will frame it as Political Federal Union Versus a  pro-Exit argument of a relationship based around trade outside the EU.

 &gt;Which way will the UK vote?

To leave 2:1.

The Federal voice will get stronger and increasingly less tasteful. Even this week there  has been talk about an EU army which Clegg adamantly swore wouldn't be a thing.

There's more economic bad weather on the horizon for the Med, and Spain's election in October/November may just prove to be the powder keg that makes seismic reform towards federalism into an immediate imperative.  If Podemos wins.....

&gt;Will the referendum even happen?

Yes.  The cost of putting it off has become too great now.  Much as real Scottish devolution powers will have to happen.  If there isn't a referendum in 2017 there's about 200 Conservative backbench MPs that will rebel.  Vote of no confidence territory.

&gt;If the UK leaves the EU will we still be part of EFTA?

There'll be a trade deal, but likely not the EFTA as it doesn't give proper control of UK borders.  

Association Agreement looks most favourable.  Access to the single market with voluntary cultural and technological opt ins like Horizon 2020 and Erasmus.  Federal advocates in the EU are open to it too.

It's a win-win.  We get the trade we originally joined for, they get to proceed with their political goals unhindered by a reluctant UK.

&gt;What would be the response of Scotland if the UK votes to leave the EU?

Whilst less Eurosceptic than the rUK (and roughly on line with London, as it goes) Scotland is far from being die hard EU fanboys.  There's still a healthy Eurosceptic undercurrent.

Will some be angry?  Sure.  Will they be considerably less angry when they realise they can still trade and now they have a 200 mile exclusion zone around their fishing and several billion more to their dying fishing industry?   Sure.  They might even realise why Iceland and Norway have both decided to stay out of the EU.

Then when they realise that joining the EU if they leave the UK means having to adopt the Euro and become part of a post national Federal Europe?    

Strange sort of independence if you ask me.   

I'm sure Scotland would be happier if they could stay in the EU and that it would stay the same.  It's not an option though.  The EU is not static.

&gt;Is the EU project doomed anyway?

On its current trajectory?  Yes.

If it ultimately retracts to a more BeNeLux/northern state of affairs, then maybe it could survive in some form, but if it continues down this federal route we're going to see civil uprisings on the European mainland.

That's because both were connected with a war that the USA lost - Vietnam. So in the public mind they were stamped with painful memory and ""loser"", though it wasn't personally their fault.

General Eisenhower though won two elections very comfortably and his era is regarded as the most prosperous age apart from Clinton's. Under Eisenhower the USA was at it's zenith of power - 50% of the world economy was American, they were running budget *and* trade surpluses, unemployment was low. 

Eisenhower also embarked on the biggest successful public spending investment in history: the building of the interstate highway system, which is credited with turbo-charging the American economy in the second half of the 20th century, because goods from the poorer states could finally reach the markets in the richer ones, and the economic growth generated as a result paid for the interstate many million times over.

The question isn't whether one group is more important than the other, but how you divvy up seats in parliament. While I'm sympathetic to voting reform, I actually think this election's UKIP/SNP result is also a potential example of how PR might led to less representative outcomes.

I have posted this elsewhere, but I think it's worth repeating here. The issue here is that UKIP had numerous 2nd and 3rd place finishes that led to a decent-sized chunk of the popular vote. Under PR they would have earned somewhere around 81/82 seats, as opposed to the 1 they received. For those in support of voting reform, it seems that they got robbed.

But does being 2nd or 3rd best in a lot of districts really merit greater representation? UKIP was only capable of convincing one group of voters that they had the best candidate available to represent the district's interest. Would giving them 81 more MPs really reflect their constituents' desires for who represents them? I don't buy it.

Likewise with the result of the SNP. They earned around 4.7%, and came away with 56 seats. At first glance, it's absurd that they got so many more seats than UKIP while earning less than half of UKIP's share of the popular vote. But the SNP only ran in Scotland, which has a population of roughly 8% of the UK. Even if Scottish turnout was better than UK turnout overall, the SNP had a ceiling of maybe 9-10% of the popular vote (had they won 100% of the Scottish vote). More likely, their ceiling was somewhere around 6-8%.
Under PR, the SNP would have had 26 or so seats less, despite winning 56 out of 59 of Scotland's MPs. Not only that, but the SNP actually won many of their races at around 50% of the vote, if not more.

In other words, in almost all races that the SNP competed, they were the voters' first choice by far—in many cases by an outright majority. In almost all races that UKIP competed, they were the voters' second or third choice. Why should UKIP be rewarded for running lots of mediocre candidates in more districts and the SNP be punished for winning most of their elections in a smaller region with a smaller population?

I think some voting reform in the UK would be great, but I don't think this election's result necessarily demonstrates why PR is the best choice. I think that sometimes PR can actually have less representative outcomes of the peoples' desires than FPTP. What is more likely needed is both a change to Parliament's size/representative structure and voting reform at the same time.

To be honest since becoming party leader Ed's image control by the party has been awful. They never got him into the press strongly enough and even with Brown good or bad the public would see and hear him a lot more (he was PM to be fair but Cameron still in the press in opposition). Ed's loudest leadership moment from outside the politics sphere was hitting back against the Daily Mail. There does seem to be a point where maybe that was clear enough to change leader but it was never taken. It almost paid off since election people started to warm to him, but it was too late by that point for his policies to be heard over people judging him as a person.

null,false,UnmixedGametes,null,null,null,"    I think I can answer this one, as I have worked at Board level in a company that handled over 2,000 zero hours contract workers.

The point for me is that ZHC arrangements are not bad *per se*, but can be badly used by poor employers.

Our staff were all highly trained and technical people (in aircraft engineering, oil rigs, financial IT, and so on) earning around £50,000 a year average (£20 - 100k range). They worked on ZHC for these reasons:

- simple billing systems
- insurance coverage via a group scheme
- health and life benefits
- pension benefits
- significantly easier to move in and out of multiple assignments (often 10 a year)
- tax saving (even after any fees we applied to run all the above)

So, for a lot of people (around 1.5m technical contractors in the UK) who have no problems finding work, are in high demand, and enjoy short assignments and lots of travel, ZHC is a great thing.

BUT, after deep technical analysis and consultation, we felt that ZHC was never appropriate for anyone earning under £15/hr or where they were tied into long term, low utilisation contracts with no security and low chance of a follow on role.

Yes, but this has as much truth to it as the trope that Labour doesn't understand the economy. Neither trope is true because it's not Labour or Conservatives that have to understand the economy but the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who are individuals, not parties.  
  
Unfortunately, if you listen to economists they'll tell you [Osborne hasn't got a clue what he's doing](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/03/osborne-audit-what-have-we-learned). Also, and equally unfortunately, the press has tended to report the opposite viewpoint either because of ideology, or misunderstandings of how the economy actually works.  
  
There's also the fact that, regardless of their understanding of economics, the Chancellor doesn't control the world economy and it's the world economy that largely determines our fortunes because it's that economy that sets relative currency rates, determines the cost of materials, whether and to what extent our economy is able to compete against other economies and so on. Overblown writings about the Chancellor rescuing the economy (or destroying it) is horseshit, but it's done because people don't like the idea that our fates are largely not of our own making and that what the Chancellor does is, at best, pissing around with the deckchairs on the Titanic.

null,false,Alwaysfair,null,null,null,"I posted this yesterday, but this is how I rationalised my vote for the Conservatives.    

I voted for them on the back of their economic policy, I believe their effort to cut the deficit sooner puts the UK in a much safer longer term position.
Firstly, Mr Krugman and anti austerity, I have read much of his stuff and his books and find that he has been making this same argument for the past 5 years watering it down little by little. His fear was that austerity and lack of stimulus would cause a great depression. It hasn't. Social damage while often terrible for the individual has largely left both US and UK societies untouched as their flexible labour markets have cushioned unemployment; both now approaching record lows of 5%. Growth has also returned be it later than expected, Krugman's philosophies IMO and others find more merit in Southern European economies than in the US and UK.
While I want to see debt falling I am not an advocate for zero levels of debt, some debt is good for an economy as we can borrow very cheaply, this is the major argument normally put forward by those against austerity, however our debt load does need to be reduced and that money does have to be repaid. There are several reasons why I think reducing debt quickly is important, firstly another recession will strike one day and going in to a new recession with debt still high – and it’s higher now than at any time since the late 1960s could leave less room for manoeuvre.
The other far bigger reason is that of future economic growth, the UK has an ageing population that will start hitting budgets hard from about 2027 making a balanced budget ever more difficult to achieve. It's worth pausing to think that Japan which has the oldest population in the world and who is also a leader in innovation and robotics has only just managed to stay stagnant over the past decade. The other looming issue is that of European stagnation and an overall global slowdown which could hit the UK hard as it searches for new markets outside of its shrinking pool of consumers.
The country is sold on austerity, the next government has a clear mandate off the public, to rebalance the economy and get debt down as fast as possible. It’s rare for a public to be sold on the idea of less public spending, other social democracies struggle to cut spending programs and end up having to pray for growth to return as debt continues to build up. We don’t, we can take a faster route using both growth and reductions.
My fear is that if we don’t take the Conservatives opportunity to reduce debt, we may never do it. Governments tend not to be strong, they make unfunded pledges to get elected and stay in power, this could mean that the deficit is added to time and time again, pushing debt higher and higher, the USA is a prime example of this although its gets there by slightly different means.
If the UK’s debt can be dealt with now when we have both the political will and the means then lets do it before we have a government that doesn’t have either the will or the means.",null,0,null,1431172071,null,0,false,0,cr3hw9s,null,t3_35dwg9,null,t1_cr3hw9s,null,t3_35dwg9,null,null,null,1432860232,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

Historians in the tradition of Marx analyse change in society by looking at *classes* such as the capitalists, the bourgeoisie, the proletariat, the aristocracy, seeing how the historical changes influence the fortunes of different classes.

It's not necessarily a zero sum game, however, it's certainly possibility for one class to benefit at the expense of another. Class war is a situation where one social class is trying to radically further its interests at the expense of another class.

This is exactly what we are saying the Tories are doing. They are implementing radical policies to improve the material fortunes of the elite, the 1%, at the expense of ordinary people in Britain.

Utd can do it because their turnover is double ours.

We're going to have 30-50m net to spend each summer. If an average of a quarter of that is being spent on strikers every year, and all the while we're driving down the cost of our squad (because we're adding ageing assets that can't be sold on), we're going to be in worse and worse shape.

In my opinion, yes. If 15% of the population vote for you, then those 15% of people should be represented by 15% of the parliamentary seats. This way, everyone is the country is represented. As it stands, those millions of people are not represented in parliament, which aside from the (in my view) injustice, can also and probably will disillusion some of them and push them away from the political system.

&gt;Under PR, the SNP would have had 26 or so seats less, despite winning 56 out of 59 of Scotland's MPs. Not only that, but the SNP actually won many of their races at around 50% of the vote, if not more.

The SNP would have that many MPs representing the exact proportion of the population who wanted the SNP to represent them. I don't see a problem there. 

&gt;In other words, in almost all races that the SNP competed, they were the voters' first choice by far

They were the most popular choice, but I don't see why being the most popular party means your opinions are the only ones that should count. I'd like to see everyone's choice count for something.

&gt;I think some voting reform in the UK would be great, but I don't think this election's result necessarily demonstrates why PR is the best choice. I think that sometimes PR can actually have less representative outcomes of the peoples' desires than FPTP.

I disagree. I dislike UKIP as much as the next guy, but I don't believe that 1 seat in parliament represents the people of Britain's desires.

You either need to convince the voters that you are a positively good option for them (like the SNP in Scotland, or the LibDems in 2010), or that even if you aren't ideal you are truly the least worst option when the worst one is truly awful (which is what the Conservatives managed to for a lot of people who didn't love them but thought that Labour would  wreck the economy).

Labour at best was ""not the Conservatives"" and neither its propaganda nor that of its supporters demonized the Conservatives to nearly the same degree that Labour was demonized.

Actual jobs created - 1.9 million since the start of the last parliament.

&gt; First fall in living standards over a five-year period since modern records began in 1960?

Using data 2 years old, from those sources ie. when the effects of the global recession were still being fully felt. Meanwhile, income inequality [has fallen](http://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/comms/r96.pdf), which is a better way of addressing overall inequality in [in the long term](http://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/conferences/presentations/BRoantree_RES2015.pdf) than a redistributive tax/benefits system. To make up for the fact that it works in the long term, the conservatives have raised the personal allowance and pledged to do so again, to £12,500, raising those on the lowest wages out of tax. At the same time, ensuring that no one who works on minimum wage pays income tax.

&gt;please be factual rather than speculative

Hard to do, when you are talking about the rhetoric and philosophies of parties, but [this](https://fullfact.org/articles/top_rate_tax_50p_Treasury_revenue-27956) shows that higher taxes on the rich never raise the money they are expected to make, and in some cases actually loses the treasury money. When the conservatives have taken steps to lower it they have been bemoaned.

Linked directly with that is the fact AV was the system people did not even want. It was the result of a compromise between the Libdems and Torys, when the lib Dems should have stuck to their guns and demanded PR from the beginning of their negotiations with the Torys. When it was announced it was between FPTP and AV, it was a half arsed offer which people were not enthused about settling for.  It's like being offered long life milk when we wanted cravendale. People did not want their shitty milk. 

Lastly, propaganda. The conservatives/labour/media printed a huge amount of what can only be disguised as lies in the lead up to the vote, you could literally see Nick Clegg's desperate attempts to debunk them but it wasn't enough.

Edit: I've just made a self post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/35fzg5/since_the_av_referendum_has_been_talked_about_a/) detailing just why AV is so bad but I'll replicate it here:

Imagine an election with 3 parties in it: A, B and C. 130 people vote in the election with the alternate vote, listing in their order of preference. 

Votes|Order
:--|:--
49|ABC
40|CAB
39|BCA
2|BAC

No one has a majority there so C is eliminated (note B has 41 votes), and his 40 votes are all transferred to the second preference of A.

Votes|Order
:--|:--
49|ABC
40|AB
39|BCA
2|BAC

A now has 50+41=91 votes, which is a majority and wins the election. 

Let’s redo the election but this time the 2 people who voted BAC instead decide they like A more so vote ABC 

Votes|Order
:--|:--
49+2|ABC
40|CAB
39|BCA

This time B has the least number of votes and is eliminated and all his votes are given to C


Votes|Order
:--|:--
49+2|ABC
40|CAB
39|CA

Now C has 40+39 votes and hence has a majority.

This is a problem because in the first election A won, yet in the second election 2 people decided to vote for A instead of B and that caused Party A to lose, which goes against what you'd expect to happen.

To see what a disaster it is you just have to look at the Netherlands which uses that system

1) Constant, unworkable coalitions due to the huge amount of parties that can gain seats. Not one government has survived it's full term without collapsing this century.

2) The parties get to decide how highly placed a candidate is in the list, so they effectively get to to decide who gets kicked. They have complete control over individual MPs which are basically slaves. Big politicians are untouchable and just let their pawns fall for their mistakes.

3) No real regional representation. Parties have no reason to give a shit about anywhere except the big cities. No approachable local MPs or links to the community.

4) Because nobody ever has anything like a majority two or three completely opposed parties are always forced into coalitions which don't please anybody. There is no direction or strong leadership within the Netherlands because of this tug of war. Everything has to be painfully extorted.

So I dislike direct PR almost as much as I dislike FPTP. There needs to be some middle ground.

* The 'yes' campaign ran a terrible, confusing campaign and didn't utilise their resources (Nigel Farage was outspokenly in favour, but the 'yes' campaign ignored him because he's not left-wing)
* The 'no' campaign successfully convinced most people that AV is a confusing system (it's not) and that changing it would be a huge waste of money (it wouldn't)
* Labour practically ignored it because they were angry at the Lib Dems, as were many of the LDs' supporters
* Lots of people voted 'no' despite being in favour of electoral reform, because they wanted PR (I think this was probably a mistake, though honestly even if the referendum had passed, the Tories would still be refusing to try a real PR system because 'the people voted for AV')

null,false,ihateirony,irish,Irish Expat in London,null,"Outright giving them 81 more MPs in a crude fashion would not do that, but for proportional representation you could just collapse districts together making for larger districts with more seats. So let's say you have three districts, for example Croydon Central, Croydon North and Croydon South and in each of them UKIP got 33% of the vote and Labour got 66% of the vote and won all three seats. This means that in each of these areas a third of all people are unhappy and their views are unrepresented. If you collapsed them together, called the district Croydon and gave it three seats two would go to Labour and one would go to UKIP. That way you're not just representing the views of 66% of the people in Croydon, you're representing 99% of them. Do this across the UK and then the parliament becomes a group of people voting on issues that are more representative of what the actual country looks like. Parliament voting becomes somewhat like a proxy for if the vote were put to the entire country, which it's supposed to be. This would make the UK's parliament more democratic.

Additionally, if you were to do Single Transferable Vote, people would probably vote differently. I know a lot of people who wanted to vote Green, but didn't because they were afraid of the Tories getting in, so had to vote Labour instead. I imagine there are Tory voters who would have similarly voted UKIP given the option, but didn't because they didn't want Labour to get in. With First Past the Post strategic votes muddy the water and make it look like Labour and Tory candidates were popular choices when in reality if given a transferable vote some of those Tory votes would have been first and foremost UKIP votes.

The SNP didn't run candidates in more districts because they wouldn't have been voted for in those districts. UKIP ran people in all of those districts because some people would have voted for them in those districts. The SNP would not be ""punished"" for ""winning"" those elections and UKIP would not be ""rewarded"" for having many candidates. They would both be rewarded with seats, except with the change that they would be rewarded proportionately to the number of people who want to be represented by them.

I don't know much about that, and there doesn't seem to be a lot of information.

For example at [TU Delft](http://www.tudelft.nl/en/study/undergraduates-bachelors/undergraduate-programmes/aerospace-engineering/admission-requirements/tuition-fees-expenses/) fees are €1,951 per year and students can work without a permit if they are EU or EFTA members. The page mentions Erasmus once but doesn't go into any details.

So how does it work? Does it give students the same sort of deal as those from EU or EFTA countries?

&gt;federalists are offering a trade deal.

The devil's in the detail though. Will our sales team and service engineers find it as easy to visit Paris or Brussels? And what happens while the deal is being hammered out? The guy who owns the company is really worried about this.

This is a good point that I didn't fully address. I was speaking, though, of the voters as a unit. As many others have said, that might not make sense, especially if you want to have a more people-centric representative body. 

Personally, I think that a better government is formed when legislators represent a district rather than an individual voter's party preference. So I prefer some form of a 'district-centric' model. I think that while national politics seems to be the main focus of campaigns, local representation is still highly important in the day-to-day activities of the government.

The Tories got 7% more of the vote than Labour, 2 million more people. UKIP got 13% of the popular vote, that's easily more than the ""progressive"" SNP and Greens combined.

People can circlejerk on here all they want about how evil the Tories are, and how poor Milband was bullied by half of the press. This sub is not representative of the majority of Britons' beliefs, and it's incredibly ironic that people's reaction to this is that the majority of Briton must be stupid, or plain evil. 

There's no room for political discussion here, the left-wing brigade would rather feel like they're the victims than actually contribute to any meaningful discussion. They'd rather trot out these evil Tory stereotypes, and just assume that anyone who votes Tory is heartless or stupid. Maybe people just have a different view of how social inequality and ""vulnerability"" can be dealt with in this country - that doesn't involve state handouts, but building an economic system that gives everyone in society the opportunity to be economically independent.",null,0,null,1431178355,null,0,false,0,cr3jqya,null,t3_35bfjy,null,t1_cr3jqya,null,t1_cr3ityx,null,null,null,1432861105,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

That's already true within England, though. I live in Cornwall. I doubt any Cornish MPs will be in positions of power despite all of them coming from the governing party. Cornwall and the greater south west are frequently overlooked in favour of London, the South East, and certain northern cities and our interests are not represented. But since we're in England, we're presumably included in the idea that we're ruling over you

(and being in NI you don't have much of a case - NI doesn't seem to want to vote for the GB parties if they even bother to stand, so you can't complain when the NI only parties don't get listened to (and especially not for SF since they won't take their seats)

&gt; If we moved to a system of proportional representation, the outlying regions would need much more devolution of powers. In the case of Northern Ireland, we'd probably be better off in a United Ireland, maybe.

It would be better if it was looked at for the regions of England too - and by that I don't mean as in the four constituent countries of the UK, but by treating each English region as its own country (in population terms they're about the same as the other three countries).

I've been reading through your comment history, and can I just say think you for being level headed in your many posts about this.

That said, I would like to point this out as a possible reason the left are declaring the moral high ground.

I think we're all trapped by our experiences somewhat. If you've been better under the Tories, it's quite easy to assume the country as a whole has been, and so naturally you'd vote that way. People's votes are often not swayed by the other people in society who would be worse off.

This is where some of the difference lies with me, personally. I'm worse off under the Tories, but not catastrophically so. I dislike them so much because other people I know are. They are generally people towards the lower rungs of society, and I would happily pick a party that makes life worse for the rest of us to make their lives more tolerable.

We're the kind of people who make up that energised base, are vocal online and get frustrated that other people don't think the same way.

null,false,Citizenegalite,null,null,null,"Has to be Dan Jarvis for me and here's why;

When we as Labour party members go about selecting a new leader we not only think about what please's us as members but also what we've learnt from this election, with this in mind in my opinion 3 factors are most important when assessing who is the best choice.

1st. Has not to be part of the London metropolitan elite that is developing in the Labour party, I think this election we saw how many people in key marginals didn't see the Labour leadership as in touch with them. Now Jarvis born in Nottingham went to Rushcliffe Comprehensive then Aberystwyth uni hardly metropolitan elite.

2nd. Not seen as part of a ""Westminster establishment."" I feel this is very important, not only this but not tainted by the Blair/Brown years, Like John Mann the MP for Bassetlaw (someone I hotly tip for some sort of shadow treasury position) said we need someone who has never been a special adviser. Now when we look at Jarvis at this criteria he again looks strong; his background of a military career then a mp is not ""Westminster establishment."" and has strong crossover appeal, one of the criticism I've already heard of Jarvis' candidacy is a lack of experience, I actually think this lack of Westminster experience might count for him especially with some UKIP voters looking for somewhere to go post Nigel.

3rd. Not being afraid of the centre. The complete decimation of the LibDems leave ample room in the centre. Jarvis is seen as someone that refuses to be pigeonholed as left or right in the party and is seen as candidate that can bring Labour back to the middle ground where I add they need to be to win elections.

4th. Can't be attacked as effectively by the right wing press. Despite what we would like to think the attacks have had an effect with the voters. Now lets see the mail/sun try and take on a decorated war hero there attacks even they realise will have not potential to majorly backfire.

These are just my thoughts.

P.S I don't claim to have major inside knowledge at the top end of the Labour party but my sources are telling me a group of MP's are starting to coalesce around Jarvis hype train is building.

We don't conduct referendums based on constituencies, because popular rule means that people are represented, not segments of the population. You say that

&gt; UKIP was only capable of convincing one group of voters that they had the best candidate available to represent the district's interest.

This is a half-truth. They did convince the greatest number of people in one constituency—but it wasn't event a *majority.*

You also make it sound as if 19,642 of the electorate were convinced UKIPers. Untrue again. 3,881,129 people were convinced.

&gt;But the fact that it can happen is a good thing. It actually allows you to vote based on local policy separate from party policy and still get representation in parliament that makes sense.

But it wouldn't make sense. You'd have the constituency majority party ruling constituencies one way and potentially a completely different majority party attempting to govern another way.

But I'm not confusing terms, I'm making a conscious point to say that the 'choice' of a district's total votes represents a good approximation of the area's preferences for who serves their best interests. In other words, I am saying that a constituency could be seen as a sort of 'person,' where the result of the constituency election reflects some approximation of rankings of candidates of an 'average' person in that constituency. Right or wrong, this is exactly the sort of thought that went into the development of a lot of representative republican electoral systems.

Personally, I'm also doubtful that fully works. I'm not here to argue full-throated for FPTP. I'm just here to make the point that there are more perspectives at play when talking about how best to build a representative government.

null,false,johnington1,null,null,null,"Well thank you for your post. It's interesting to me reading your rational for your vote. I think partly my lack of understanding the Tory electorate comes down to a few things then.

Firstly, I don't think I hold the national debt as the same importance as you do. My understanding of macroeconomics from a governing perspective is that it's all about confidence in a country's ability to pay the interest on it's debt. I don't feel as though there is a lack of confidence in this country to pay that interest, in fact far from it. That doesn't mean we shouldn't be looking to reduce the debt, to me it just means it is far from the dire situation some seem to think. I often hear locals talking about how the country is bankrupt and comparing it to a business in terms of the deficit but as far as national debts go, it's really not a bad one as a percentage of GDP compared to historic debts.

Secondly, I feel as though the best way to actually reduce the deficit so we can begin to lower the national debt would be to raise revenues rather than lower spending. Of course lowering spending in less important areas is ok and rational but not to the extent this government has planned and their cuts haven't been made clear either. As I mentioned and as you alluded to growth has gone up in the past couple of years and so the consensus seems to be among a lot of the electorate is that the economy is performing well. However, I can't strongly emphasise how much I disagree with this because the figures simply don't back it up. It is ok saying that GDP has increased but once you take into account inflation with real GDP and GDP per capita it's very clear the economy is actually performing very badly and as I said one of the worst in the developed world. I can't understand why this hasn't been highlighted in the media more to the electorate. Therefore, based on these figures it's clear to me that austerity hasn't worked and that by investing more into increasing productivity in particular this is the quickest way to reduce the national debt and at the same time solve a huge issue we have. The only down side is the national debt will go up at first but that should only be a concern if we really couldn't afford to allow it to.

Finally, I think I put more importance on issues such as housing. My Grandparents bought their first house at a very young age from a relatively average income. I feel as though people seem to have forgotten the importance in being able to own your own house and the stability that brings to peoples lives. I feel as though people have given up on making that dream to buy your own house for the average person a reality again. I guess in the end, it is a difference of priorities and disagreement in which fiscal policy works best that ultimately led us to feel different about which party to vote for but I fully stand by my opinion on the Conservatives fiscal policy and have yet to hear a compelling argument for it based on the actual figures themselves. I feel it should have been highlighted more to the public during the election campaigns so they could make an informed decisions based on the facts rather than what the politicians were telling them.",null,0,null,1431182293,null,0,false,0,cr3lar3,null,t3_35dwg9,null,t1_cr3lar3,null,t1_cr3hw9s,null,null,null,1432861835,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I used your example. If labour wins all constituencies, but conservative gets a majority vote on the party poll it will be a 50/50 government. There will be no minority parties and it would be a very strange government. But it wouldn't happen, just like a perfect tie between Conservative and Labour (with no minority seats) will almost certainly never happen.

If labour wins all constituencies then the party vote is 40/35/30 to Conservative, Labour, Green you'll get (out of 200 seats overall):

* 100 seats of labour due to constituencies and being above their party vote percentage.
* 80 seats conservative  (to match the percentage that voted for them)
* 20 seats green (fill in the remaining).

You basically work top down, pushing people in until they reach the percentage needed. It would almost never be this lopsided (give the 100% labour win being pretty much impossible) but that's how it would work.

Labour get majority in government.

&gt; You'd have the constituency majority party ruling constituencies one way and potentially a completely different majority party attempting to govern another way.

Only one party gets the majority (potentially with coalitions). There's only one government to which they all belong. It's basically the same system as now, expect half of the seats in parliament will not be linked to a constituency. The fact they may have a constituencies majority means nothing.

You have to think of it as two ways to get to the same location. People voted in on constituencies are not less important than those voted in through the party vote. They get an equal say in parliament.

This system is not two separate systems. It's two part of the same whole. We live in a country where the choices made more strongly represent the party we pick, not the local constituency. MMP is meant to help create a better blend of the two. People **want** to vote for national policy separate from local policy, but we only want a single parliament. MMP is a nice combination of them, and except in the most extreme cases (where all constituency seats go to a single party) it pretty much gets PR into parliament.",null,0,null,1431182449,null,0,false,0,cr3ld6o,null,t3_35dpp8,null,t1_cr3ld6o,null,t1_cr3kw9l,null,null,null,1432861868,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

We have (had) a three main party system with each of the Conservatives, LD and Labour representing some social class or philosophy. All are Unionist. The other parties are either nationalist (SNP, PC etc) or either single issue or based on fairly narrow policies. 

Put it this way: UKIP got a shitload of votes but nobody really wanted Nigel Farrage as PM. UKIP also put *a lot* of candidates which is why they got more votes than say SNP. Probably most of them weren't much good. 

So, for any given area, the real contest was Con v Lab or Lab v Lib or some permutation of those three. Rarely do you get a 3-way marginal, right? So UKIP voters in each of those seat either don't usually vote and this is their first time, or they're taking votes from all of the others (they were expected to split the Tory vote but this hasn't really happened).

So in all FPTP is a good system for keeping a stable majority government with an experienced, broad-based unionist party at the helm. Lib Dems until now were quite a good third party alternative. PR seems fairer but tends to produce unstable coalition governments which can result in indecisive policy. Look at shoddy economic policy in PR countries in southern Europe.

The problem I have with FPTP *since this election* is that:

 a) the 3rd part got blown away so now we've only got 2 main parties - this is undesirable in my view, if you look at the USA.

I think people fail to grasp and understand how it works so call it unfair and ""non-representational"" of how the country feels. But this isn't necessarily true. For those that don't quite understand this is it in its most simplest of terms:
The UK is broken up into smaller pieces, smaller constituencies, people in these constituencies vote for a particular party. So for example in constituency A 60% of people vote for the conservatives, this means the conservatives win a seat for this constituency. Therefore this means that while UKIP had 12.7% of the UK overall votes, they were spread out across all constituencies, meaning that they only had a few percent here and there in a lot of different constituencies - this resulted in them having lots of votes, but spread out, and not winning enough votes in one constituency to gain a seat. This is the same for the Greens.
To me, this makes perfect sense, as you vote for how you and your local area feel, and not the country (After all, could you imagine having each party have to choose said number of MP's to be in parliament?!).

If you don't think 15% of voters are swung by the media, and most likely a far higher proportion given that they are swinging in all directions, I really wouldn't be surprised if something like 30% if not more of the vote was swung one way or another by the media, it just happens that while 15% swung one way, 15% swung the other way, but it doesn't take much for 17% to swing one way and 13% to swing the other way and suddenly that is a 4% difference and there is the election, there are your seats in parliament and there is your majority, and anyone claiming that the tory libellous propaganda machine, with Murdock at the helm, wasn't firing full bore the whole time is just an idiot. 

Whereas on Labours side, it was a largely positive campaign, and it wasn't a great campaign, further weakened by the muted Conservative government for 5 years, you can't go after there ridiculous cuts and over reaching policies when they were all stopped, it is hard to make a negative campaign against a more moderate government, especially when a more moderate conservative government looks a lot like a Blair years Labour one, that was one of the problems, Labour are still just conservative light, the problem was a Conservative/Lib Dem government was also Conservative light. This was also why the Lib Dems got so destroyed, firstly due to the lying, but secondly as a vote for the LD was a vote for a conservative government, so you might as well vote else where, ironically, there were more Conservative/LD marginals than Labour/LD marginals, so when the voters all left the LD, more conservatives got in than Labour, the vote against the LD and them forming a conservative government led to a conservative majority.

If labour don't go full bore negative in 2020 against the cut, and deaths that those cuts will cause, they are missing the boat. But facts of it are, Ed Miliband didn't look like a competent leader, and when it came to the polls people thought ""Do I want him as the face of Britain"", and the answer always comes back no, irrelevant of his policies, irrelevant of his ideals, he is still the face and a lot of people don't realise or don't care that they are voting for a local representative, because they know that that representative is just going to be whipped into line in the government and therefore vote with the party, so therefore you vote with the party, and therefore it comes down to who you want the face of Britain to be.

But labour campaign was terrible anyway, Ed Miliband taught economics are Harvard, was this even mentioned once during the campaign, I don't remember it, and then he lost because people voted for who was strong on the economy, which most economist agreed was labour, but you ask you average voter who is best for business and it will come back as the Tories all day long, you ask them who is going to cut taxes, it will be the Tories all day long, neither of these things are actually true, but truth is irrelevant in politics, propaganda is everything.

Similarly, for example, you could choose to invest all your money in, I dont know, the rouble lets say. There's a chance that Russia might sort its shit out, withdraw from Ukraine, and all the sanctions get undone which would send the rouble soaring (not an expert, just illustrative example). There you might make 50, 75% in a few months if that all happens.- But there's a low chance of that happening, and a high chance that it will continue to decay.

Labour would be better off, for the lower class, lower middle, and even probably the middle class. Pretty much anyone who can't afford Private schools, Private healthcare, may have to rent at some point, actually will use public transport, labour were better, maybe not money in your pocket better, but quality of services provided that you are going to use, better. If you don't use any of these services, of course you are better off with the money in your pocket, you are just throwing your money away and getting nothing in return otherwise, that is who the Tories favour, but facts are a lot of healthy middle age people assume they aren't going to need the school system, public transport or healthcare any time soon and would rather have the money in their pocket, what they haven't taken into account is if they do they are fucked, if their friends, parents, child, do they are fucked, because they aren't going to be up to standard under a tory government. They will be cut, that is what the conservatives do, cut, good or bad, cut it. 

Then there is the fact that middle class people can live in good school districts, they don't feel the real brunt of the cuts, the worst schools that need the funding, they can just move away for them. 

The problem is people don't realise any of this, I know people who work at Tesco who voted conservative, because they are quite frankly ignorant, that isn't better for them, it isn't better for their family, it isn't better for their friends and it isn't better for equality as a whole across the country.

null,false,Your_Personal_Jesus,null,null,null,"The team has no spine, literally and figuratively. The real big teams always build down the spine of teams, the teams that underachieve like ourselves always buy alot of flair players because ""they have talent"". 

We never really invest down the middle of the pitch the way we should and therefore get punished. Our only real major successes came when Modric gave us an elite player in the heart of midfield (which by the way, we lucked out on since we bought Modric to be yet another flair player), and a solid base in King and Dawson along with Huddlestone/Parker in midfield. 

I honestly believe that Spurs as a club, and especially a fan base, focus too much on the flair players we always have and take way more pride in having top individual guys than building a solid team top to bottom and it hurts the club. It's like we always bake a shitty cake but put some really awesome icing and toppings over it and expect it to be a good cake. If you don't put the right ingredients in the base of the cake, it doesn't matter just how great the icing is, it's a shitty cake. If we don't improve down the heart of the pitch, we'll never get to where we need, no matter how many Bale's and Eriksen's and Kane's we produce, just like in the 90s we had Klinsmann's and Ginola's and Sheringham's and didn't do a thing.

People will say money, but the teams around Europe around our level (kinda upper midtable squads) like Dortmund, Atletico Madrid, Sevilla, Lazio, et al, all see success because they build their teams smart by building teams with strong spines. Compare our midfield paring to a Atletico midfield or Dortmund and it's not on the same level even though we've spent far more money than them. Southhampton can lose more or less all the flair players over the summer and still be fine, because they kept the base of Schniderlin and Wanyama. You need that base to go forward with, otherwise the small teams will sneak results by you, and the big teams will simply grind you out at best, blow you off the park at worst. We need to stop investing in a million and one attacking midfielders and start really putting our money into top level centre backs and central mids.

This guy does a similar thing and is a world parkour champion, that's crazy strength. 

A lot more athletes are going vegan and experiencing *benefits*. But listen, I'm totally aware that there are probably a disproportionate amount of skinny vegans but look, passive people in general are more likely to go vegan realistically and there's a lot of misinformation out there about veganism and strength that will likely to dissuade a lot of the people who want to build muscle in the first place. There aren't many vegans (less than 1% of the UK population are vegan) so chances are you're not going to see many that are noticeably athletic, and there's an even greater chance that you just haven't noticed the ones that are (confirmation bias and all). 

I don't know why exactly people associate building size and strength with eating meat. I mean, muscle building is largely due to hormones anyway. Look at chimps, gorillas, and all the other herbivores (chimps and bonobos are omnivores but less than 3 percent of their diet comes from meat anyway and they mostly eat fruit). They're strong as shit right? So why are humans suddenly so different? You think if you fed chimps meat all day they'd get jacked up and be super strong?

&gt;You lived in the UK until you were 10
You can register to become a British citizen if you were born in the UK on or after 1 January 1983 and neither of your parents was a British citizen or settled at that time.
You must:
be 10 years old, or older
and have lived in the UK until you were 10, or older
You must also normally have spent no more than 90 days outside the UK in each of the first 10 years of your life.
If you spent more time than this outside the UK but there are special reasons for this, you’ll need to explain them on the form.


If either of your parents became settled/citizen after your birth then:


&gt;Your parent has become a British citizen or settled since your birth
You can register to become a British citizen if you fulfil all of the criteria:
you were born in the UK on or after 1 January 1983
you’re under 18 when you apply
one of your parents has become a British citizen or settled in the UK since you were born

And every manager inherits players, no manager can simply start from scratch. And he did far worst than the manager he inherited the squad from, one I'm sure would be happy to come back so yeah, I kinda do. 

Remember when Redknapp, AVB and Sherwood all went with the highest percentage as Spurs manager and everyone was like ""well, that's so easy to do, we're growing as a club, any manager can get that record"", yet Poch is somehow behind ALL THREE? 

The mentality that holds back that club is ""we should aim for top 4"".

My favourite is raising the income tax threshold to £10,000 and, while it might be stopping something, stopping the snoopers charter. Oh and of course getting rid of the human rights act never got too a vote.

They had no choice but go into coalition, and water down the worst of the Tories. A Tory party, ruling by minority, would have done far worse, when it wasn't being ineffective, and after a few months would have worked for a re-election which they likely would have won, partly because as a party they have more money, partly because people would see now they needed stability and would have punished the lib dems (not as badly) for failing to provide it.

They did see this is what would happen - though possibly not as badly - however they felt the good of the country is more important than the good of the party. That is what I want from a party.

I don't think this will be termnial. When the Tory Majority collapses, whether that is in 5 or 10 years, i feel at the same time some level of forgiveness will come with it as people realise how bad it could have been. 

I didn't vote for them this time, however I did in both 2010 and 2005, but a lot of people don't seem to realise how difficult their position was 5 years ago.

&gt; I'm sure you'll point to some list of things they supposedly stopped but what good was that really?

Yes this reaction is knee jerk but our defense has been absolutely woeful this season and maybe that boils down to other positions being weak in midfield. Mason needs an upgrade and Eriksen needs a fire lit under his ass too (Pritchard?).

The squad is unbalanced, we all know this. But, when given the option between playing a formation that doesn't capitalize on the glaring weaknesses in the opposing side with a player who has rarely performed for us and playing a young player in a game that will feed right into his biggest strength, the choice is abundantly clear and I honestly don't see how you can't understand that. Chiriches is the exact opposite player for this type of opposition. The exact opposite. He's not fast, he's not secure on the ball, he passes poorly, and he makes rash decisions. You beat Stoke by staying compact in the midfield and pushing it out wide to your fullbacks. You lose to Stoke by allowing turnovers in key positions and giving their midfield full of long strike specialists possession in dangerous places. It's basic common sense.


Townsend would not have been on to score. He would have been on to make them play wide and give us room in the middle, so that our players who like to play the passing game wouldn't be swarmed by physical tough tacklers like they were all game.

For ex-party leaders that retain their seat, eg Miliband, they are normally given some form of (Shadow) Cabinet seat - this can be seen through the example of Iain Duncan Smith, who is Minister of the DWP after being leader of the Tories during the Blair years     
For your normal MPs who lose their seats, it depends entirely on who it is. Many of the older ones simply go into retirement. Traditionally some of the high profile ones are given peerages, but this has been controversial and so seems to be slowing down (maybe they'll give one to Cable? Still seems unlikely). Others have gone on to have high profile media roles - Michael Portillo has that railway show, for example. Some go into political commentary, writing articles for The Times or making regular appearances on Daily Politics. Many more will go into business, particularly as lobbying gives them direct access to many top firms - very big politicians like Hague can get huge deals from the biggest firms to sit on their board of directors, which is what he is doing for a military firm         
Then there are the very low profile MPs, traditionally those who won an extremely marginal seat that they then lost at the next election.

null,false,eean,null,null,null,"&gt; Economists generally agree that printing money, especially in large amounts leads to higher inflation over the medium and long term. That isn't a controversial statement.

Not exactly - inflation is prices of stuff going up. If there's a general increase in earnings (perhaps due to low unemployment) that people use to spend on things, and there isn't slack to allow supply to respond to demand, that will make prices go up. But if there's an increase in money supply or the monetary base (measuring 'money' isn't trivial anymore, it comes in many forms) and that money is stashed under beds or in bank accounts then there won't be any inflation. Or like during a recession and high unemployment increased government spending (and it matters little where that money comes from) won't cause inflation since there is plenty of unused production around, so prices won't be bid up.

So I agree that increase money supply causing inflation is the general rule, especially if that money is ending up in Joe Citizens pocket. But the exceptions are very important!

null,false,duckwantbread,eng-essex,Essex,null,"3 seats would be far too small a size and would arguably be a worse system than having just 1 seat per constituency, for example imagine an election where Party A gets 40% of the vote, Party B gets 30% of the vote, Party C gets 25% of the vote and Party D gets 5% of the vote. Using the D'Hondt method (a standard PR method) that would allocate 1 seat each to Parties A, B and C which seems unfair given Party A received 15% more of the vote than Party C yet have ended up with the same number of seats as them. If similar outcomes happened in every constituency we'd be left with 3 parties having a third of the seats each despite having nowhere near as many votes as each other. This happens because we can't assign fractions of a seat so we either have to round up or down each party's number of seats so that it works out, there's various different ways we can do this, the Sainte-Lague is an alternative that is arguably fairer (although with only 3 seats in the election would give the exact same result here).

If we instead had 15 seats then with the D'Hondt method Party A would receive 6 seats, B would receive 5 seats and C would receive 4 seats which is far more representative of the actual result. As the number of seats tends to infinity it will become more and more representative but we have to cut it off somewhere.

Find a gentler wash for face, body and hair sound logical. Eucerin and La Roche-Posay make gentle ones.

When my skin is at its most sensitive, irritated, driest state, I like to slather Vaseline (the jelly) on damp skin. It helps my skin to recuperate after damage (recently, irritation from Avobenzone; just found that out).

Firstly this idea that the well off shouldn't pay more, we have tax cuts for the most wealthy at a time of extreme austerity, that just categorically does not make sense to me. Secondly this idea of protected areas (Labour does this too) which they do as a vote winner. If you're going to cut spending is it not more sensible to spread the load rather than have massive cuts to certain departments? If you vote Conservative, you agree to austerity, do you not have some responsibility to take some of the pain as well? The fact is they only want austerity if it doesn't harm them &amp; I just think most people in our society are *incredibly* selfish &amp; self serving.

null,false,VaqueroGalactico,null,null,null,"&gt; After signing 6 defensive players

First of all, I count 5. Dier, Yedlin, Davies, Vorm, Fazio. Stambouli is a midfielder... more defensive than attacking, but a midfielder.

Dier and Yedlin were both picked up as options for the future. They are not intended to be players that come in and start on day 1. Dier was somewhat forced to, due to injuries, and he's done reasonably well (but he's no RB).

Davies came in and hasn't played much, but the fact that he's an option is almost certainly related to Rose's improved performances. Also, unless we get unlucky and have both out at once (like now), we don't have to shove Jan into LB.

Vorm was clearly brought in as backup. He's been solid when he's played, bar maybe one game?

Fazio is the only one who was bought to come in immediately and start. He's played some good games but more often has misfired.

Overall, Fazio is the only one I would call a failure.

Arguably, the problem is that none of our signings improved our first XI. I don't know who is to blame for this: Poch? Levy? Baldini? A combination of all three? Also, given the number of games we've played this season, more rotation in Europe would have been welcome.

null,false,disco54,null,null,null,"Not at all and it depends on your definition of good. There was a determined governmental decision to wind the industry down that was made in the 1950's environmentalism as a movement wasn't really considered. 

Mining was a nationalised industry and as such the government was responsible for the profits and losses of individual pits and most pits made losses and lots were unsafe and had terrible conditions. Almost all pits had accidents or explosions due to gas which meant the government was responsible for safety, wages, sick pay, compensation, unworkable seams, lost equipment, surveying, sinking that led to nowhere and was unprofitable and much more this meant that the few profitable pits were effectively paying to keep unprofitable pits open. You can argue that this is what public money is for and so long as there are more profitable pits then thats ok and you might be right but then some profitable pits came to the end of their natural life and closed or the unprofitable pits became so unprofitable it was just too unviable to keep them open (either they were too dangerous or unproductive) or there may not have been a big enough workforce to keep a pit open, in the 60's there was a larger amount of social mobility and people chose to leave mining communities. 

For whatever reason decisions were made and followed through by both coloured governments. When we reach the 70's there are very strong unions who strike and oppose these closures and the general conditions and state of the country, doesn't matter, more pits close in the 70's than any other decade. This is the decade of safety improving, technology improving but pits still closing despite powerful unions negotiating against a government that allows them almost anything they want because they desperately need to keep the lights on. The 80's of course are where it all comes to a head, the unions led by Scargill take on Thatchers Tory government and they lose. They lose because of two factors: firstly Thatcher tricked the miners into stockpiling coal before they went on strike and secondly the Nottinghamshire based union the UDM decided not to strike which meant there was a small but steady trickle of coal throughout the year long strike. Once the strike was over the unions power was greatly depleted and lots of miners took inflated redundancy payments and left the industry which hastened the closure of pits that were surely to be closed anyway. Right now there are only a couple of deepcast mines operating in the uk and they are privately owned.

In the 90's a few miners sought compensation against the government for industrial disease they suffered whilst working in the mines. The courts ruled in their favour and the door was opened for everyone to claim and claim they did. The largest compensation scheme in british history ensued which at its peak was paying out over a million pounds a day to ex miners for COPD and vibration white finger. The largest single payment was for over a million pounds. (I worked on this scheme from the government side)

All of which leads us to today. Why can't there be a deepcast coal industry again? In my opinion a few reasons first and foremost pure economics chinese and polish coal is cheap and plentiful if inferior quality. Mainly because safety is not as big an issue, its not likely anyone is going to buy british coal especially given the huge initial outlay on sinking a mine when theres a cheaper product, its literally burning money. Secondly who is going work there? We're a generation or two away from the death throes of the industry the skilled force is dying or dead or too old. They might be effective trainers but even then you have to persuade people to go underground into a cold, wet, dirty, dusty, unsafe environment rather than a clean, safe office, who's going to do it? You? Thirdly the safety aspects, environmental aspects and startup costs are so prohibitive that to try to sink a mine would be so costly as to be almost impossible.

As for the legacy of the closed mines its been devastating for some areas, South Yorkshire, the South West and Wales in particular has struggled with ""Thatchers legacy"" (I appreciate Scotland, Northumberland and Merseyside have as well) but it wasn't her legacy, this was a plan executed over decades that communities weren't given any initial support to change, recover or adjust from. 

Is coal money good money? It depends on your point of view, whole communities revolved round pits, generations of men went down to work in terrible conditions and died later of awful disease. When the pit went the community took years to recover if it ever did leaving resentment and inertia. Now the deepmining industry won't ever be back.

Probably a good reason for that; a ""Robin Hood tax""[Really? I know Socialists are generally deluded, envious, odious fools, but to call it a Robin Hood tax? Idiotic.] , banning nuclear power/fracking/coal [are we going to power the entire country via tofu fuelled farts?], renationalise the rail ""improving services"" [because British Rail wasn't a rotting sack of shite?], their insane idea that women should receive lesser punishments for the same crime than a man would[really is reminiscent of the stereotypical internet feminist - ""I WANT EQUALITY THAT MAKES ME MORE EQUAL THAN YOU!""], replacing the army with a ""home defence force"", getting rid of Trident, giving illegals the right to stay in the UK [I can't possibly see how this could hurt our economy...], all immigration control taken down [?? so anyone, regardless of past crimes, regardless of their lack of skills, regardless of whether or not they can actually support themselves should be allowed to come here? Fantastic idea], joining terrorist organisations would no longer be a criminal offence, leave NATO, etc. etc. etc. 

The Greens live in a fantasy world.

People often accuse UKIP of being isolationist due to the desire to leave the EU*, yet no one levels this accusation upon the Greens. Their ideas would absolutely smash us in terms of our current relationships. Just recently we had a massive joined exercise between the 82nd Airborne and 3Para; Green's systematic dismantling of our military would obliterate Brit-US interoperability. Leaving NATO would be HUGE. Allowing our citizens to freely join groups like ISIS, who've essentially declared war on the entire world, would be catastrophic for our reputation. 

Let's look at this from a US perspective: Your ally, your partner in the ""special relationship"" suddenly turns its military into a shadow of its former self, lacking any expeditionary capability. It disarms its nuclear deterrent. It does not seek to punish citizens who join terrorist groups that may kill your service personnel. It leaves the organisation created to counter Russian aggression just after Russia starts playing geopolitical chess. Why on earth would you give any credibility to that country? Why would anyone? 

Whether the Greens like it or not, Britain and France are the big military players in Europe right now. That's not something you get to walk away from at will. Sure great powers come and go, but they don't choose to go. Actively deciding to make ourselves a military irrelevance, especially whilst the ME is kicking off for the 900th time and Russia is playing ""let's see how much land we can grab before anyone says anything lol"" would destroy us on the world stage.

*Which, incidentally, is not the same as saying ""FUCK YOU EUROPE! WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU!!!"" and more akin to ""Hey lads we like you and all, but we don't want to be in a federalised super state with you, much the same as how we wouldn't wanna become a US state despite being pretty chummy with them.",null,0,null,1431191074,null,0,false,0,cr3pd4s,null,t3_35abwa,null,t1_cr3pd4s,null,t1_cr3ko6m,null,null,null,1432863821,null,2,false,BritishSuccess,t5_2vlyo,2,null

Rich pay even more, poor get more grants, subjects that do not give a more direct impact on economics of the country should have to pay more as well. I have no idea how economically viable this is.

- Bulk:

an even more means tested loans system, at the moment i think you get a max of 3.5k maintance grant out of a 7.5k total maintanance loan(for rent, food etc.) and little to no grants for the actual tuition fee's.

Make the rich have to supply their children with money or make them pay back a hefty loan amount, while the poorer you get(or if your family looks after a disabled person) the more grant you get.

A more sliding scale that makes further education free for those that really cannot afford it and make it cost more for those that have used the system themselves to succeed and will pay back into the system to allow for further success stories.

The dream would be to allow Educators to let their child go free into university to pay them back for their hard work in enabling the future of our country.

- Very opinionated part:

Another thing which could be implemented are courses that assist the econamy and serve the country more get more grants. For example those taking STEM subjects, economics, medicine etc. will pay less(more grant less loan) while those that take subjects such as the humanities(excluding languages), will have to pay more(less grant more loan) and maybe even a deposit. This is because they are much less likely to pay back thier loan in the first place, and their subject itself is often a dead end in terms of economic expansion for the long term.",null,0,null,1431192852,null,0,false,0,cr3q8uc,null,t3_35dtq2,null,t1_cr3q8uc,null,t1_cr3ou73,null,null,null,1432864236,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I'd be really grateful for you could explain how, as I've given this a bit of thought myself.

Seems to me like you the only way you could get rid of parties would be to take them off the ballot paper - otherwise you would have groups of candidates finding some other way to build a collective brand nationally, which would tell voters the kinds of values they stand for.

If you have parties (or any other kind of political brand shared by candidates) then you surely have to allow them to choose who they keep as members, and that enables them to expel members who don't vote as the party demands. 

I suppose you could get rid of the whip by preventing parties from expelling members, or by making MPs' votes secret, but everything I think of has undesirable consequences.

I would much prefer a more proportional system of representation which would lead to multiple major parties in parliament, so that a coalition was always needed to govern.

As for the night, first off it’s not really obvious how to get into the club (unless I’m just an idiot). Pushed on the doors outside which were locked, thankfully someone from the Cuban was outside and pointed out that I had to go through their restaurant. 

The drink selection is absolutely awful. It’s 2015 so would be nice to have a beer option other than Fosters/Becks/Sol which taste like the scared urine of a rabbit. With that in mind we order one of the cocktail pitchers, (Dr. Pepper) which turned out to be two shots of Amatetto and two shots of Cherry Sourz topped with Coke. Charging £14 for four shots, none of which are Spirits, is definitely taking the piss. 

Comedy is obviously subjective and all my other points wouldn’t even be mentioned if the stand ups were amazing but the ones last night were the worst I’ve ever seen. The Compare is the only Compare I’ve seen that didn’t appear to actually have any material and solely relied on taking to the crowd. The first guy on was just terrible and also seemed to just reply on talking to the crowd peppered with Secondary School jokes about Welsh people shagging sheep. Half his act was dedicated to trying to recreate the jump thing from Dirty Dancing with a really uncomfortable looking member of the audience. Second guy was better but he didn’t have much competition. Also the music from the Cuban starting drowning out his set at one point. Is that normal? It's really distracting. 

Made a break for the exit after him as had no hope for the third guy. 

However all the staff was really pleasant and friendly.

As a result representatives have to represent a larger amount of people, which mostly makes them a poorer representation of their population. This can also make elections more divisive or force politicians to water themselves down to suit the views of many (something something New Labour). Indeed as you increase the size of the election you start to run in to problems with people seeking to appease as many people as possible, and merely being a weak compromise that leaves nobody truly happy.

I think MMP is a MUCH better way of doing things. Here's an example of it. There's a video that explains it very well in the playlist you linked too. We don't even have to use FPTP for the local representative part of the ballot, that could be AV. This is how I think voting systems should be used.

**CJ382**: For the vast majority of women in the criminal justice system, solutions in the community are more appropriate. Community sentences must be designed to take account of women’s particular vulnerabilities and domestic and childcare commitments. The restrictions placed on sentencers around breaches of community orders must be made more flexible.

**CJ383**: Existing women’s prisons should be replaced with suitable geographically dispersed, small, multi-functional custodial centres. More supported accommodation should be provided for women on release to break the cycle of repeat offending and custody.

**CJ384**: Pregnant women in prison are particularly vulnerable and the scheme provided by the charity Birth Companions, which visits pregnant prisoners once a week, stays with them through birth and gives them support afterwards, should be extended to all women who wish to use it, with government funding.

The candidates will change and drift in support over 5 years, then there will be a leadership election during which factions more visibly emerge. But at this point, May and Johnson are considered the prime candidates. 

Now that Cameron has achieved a shock victory he has a lot of authority and his friends are more powerful in parliament. I think people like Gove and Osbourne would support Boris Johnson so he's in a great position. If the tories had had a bad result, May would have had a better chance than she has now, because they'd be looking for a bigger change and she's seen as a successful Home Office leader, who famously invented the 'nasty party' phrase.

But there will be a lot of change in politics over 4/5 years. And this is especially true of the Tories, with the upcoming EU 'reform' or referendum. Quite a few of their MPs are very anti Europe and they have a slim majority. If Cameron does poorly in the struggle against them they could even defect to UKIP as two of them did last parliament.

3, Insurance. This can be 3rd party - you crash into someone, the insurance pays for the repairs to the other person's (the 3rd party) car. If someone crashes into you, their insurance covers you. 3rd party, fire &amp; theft - As with 3rd party but covers you if your car gets stolen or set on fire for whatever reason.

4, Tax. if the car is around 10 years old or less then this is based on emissions. The lower the emissions, the less you pay. You tax a car when you buy it. details are here https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-tax

You can make the case that economically it was a sensible decision, but the signal it sent to their supporters was a great big 'fuck you'. It was, quite simply, political suicide. I still find it hard to believe that the entire parliamentary party was stupid enough to do it.

The attacking off the ball is a trait in many defensive coaches. Overlap, get the cross in, rinse and repeat for the most part. Rodgers isn't like that, he wants fullbacks to be intelligent, like a midfielder but with the athleticism to cope with the physical demands. Rodgers wants his player to attack WITH the ball. Mourinho, when he first went to Chelsea, pushed his fullbacks up, but they weren't really overlapping fullbacks. Or if they were, one would be the runner, the opposite side would sit. 3 at the back suits Rodgers because he likes both sides to get forward, but we get exposed in a four because it leaves the two central defenders isolated, and without a true defensive mid, the middle becomes vulnerable too. Maybe if Rodgers does go back to a back four, he can look at maybe having one conservative fullback and one attacking one, and then balancing it out in the attack (one conservative wide mid, one very attacking one - like we did under Kenny in the 80's). 

Here's a quote from the man himself: Some players would rather not have the ball than have it. I need players who want to have the ball. 

That's not a slur on Manquillo, but it's not in his nature particularly to play like a Rodgers full back. He shares traits with a Simeone/Rafa/Mourinho full back.

I understand its a choice but i laugh at the hypocrisy of ANY leader that says that tuition fees are a good thing; considering most of them had their tuition paid for. I want to go into healthcare and make people better and the only way i can do that is through university 

I understand what youre saying as well; Ive worked in the NHS (and private) and the people that ive seen dealing with mental health problems; its horrible. the lives that some of these people with certain condition is horrible; on several occasions i came back from work in tears because there was nothing more i could do to help them. Its why mental health (as a whole) should be taken way more seriously now. We know so much more about mental health conditions that it is imperative that as a country do something more about it and to stop the stigma around it.

EDIT: as a whole i meant the general public; inside the NHS (especially with nurses as they are the backbone of the NHS) its taken pretty seriously if you find the right people.

With young people; i believe its unfair to award them 'gifted' at too young of an age because generally speaking (i know not in all cases) it doesn't necessarily benefit the child and it just puts them 'in the spotlight' and generally causes more stress for the child. I know this as I worked as a school governor for a High school/6th form and in admissions for a university (again, not saying all cases but most of the cases that i saw).

EDIT 2: from the thread below; people are gifted in different ways. for instance one of my classmates was okay at english and maths, not the brightest but he was okay, but he left high school at 16; did a motorcycle mechanics course at college and now he has his own business with 3 different garages all because at school he was shunned because he was not 'gifted' at the traditional subjects. So what im trying to say is; follow what you love doing is the most important thing and i know it sounds cliche, but if you put all of your effort into what you find interesting. you will get noticed for it.

The bonus is that they and Labour would've had control over the timing of the election because they could combine and vote the government out in a vote of confidence, so the Conservatives could've been booted out of office even earlier.

Now most of you aren't probably even aware you have a Mario Pasalic under contract, but you do and you loaned him out to La Liga side Elche and him being a favorite amongst Hajduk fans, a fair amount of us have kept a close eye on him. 

Anyways transition from a crap league like Croatian to La Liga is a big step and Mario took a while to adapt, especially since he plays a somewhat different role in Elche then he did with us. With us he was closer to goal, still played both ways but was more offensively oriented whereas in Elche his role is that of a defensive midfielder and his main concern is defense.

Because of that his start was a bit rough and after starting the first game for Elche (against Barcalona at Nou Camp no less, imagine that go to summer vacation after playing against fucking Hrvatski Dragovoljac or something and you come back to find yourself responsible for covering Iniesta) he quickly found himself on the bench entering as a substitute.

Once he got used to the role and the much higher quality and quicker pace of football then he was used to, he fought his way back into the starting XI and since December he's a regular starter for Elche. Overall he played 28 games and during the past month he even scored his first goals for Elche. Currently he's at 28 appearances and 3 goals in La Liga and a bit of trivia Croatian media throw around is that he's the youngest regularly starting midfielder in any club in the top 5 leagues. Lately he joins the attack much more often then he did at the start of the season and finds himself in scoring chances and honestly he should have scored more then 3 goals. He still needs to work on his finishing.

Still he's made quite a progress. He improved overall, plays faster, he's improved on the defensive side and he's a better player now then he was a year ago.

Why did I write all this? Well, I like the kid, and as I said he's still loved by the fans. Not because he gives interviews in which he says that all he ever wanted was to play for us and that he doesn't care about Reals or Barcas and that the only reason he left was because the club needed money, but because he proved his love for Hajduk when he was wearing our shirt. I could expand on that and write an essay about what I mean by that but since most of you wouldn't care lets just leave it at that.

All in all you lot did good business by picking him up.

If Cameron's offering this as a free vote then he quite possibly doesn't want it to go through - if it did it would cement perception of them, in some sections of the public, as the nasty party of toffs who hunt innocent foxes.

Repeal of the fox hunting ban has quite a lot of support in the counties, amongst the Tories' rural base - local party members who are active in fundraising and leafletting.

If a bill repealing the fox hunting ban is defeated then Cameron can turn around to the county tories and say, ""well, sorry, I tried - I looked after your interests, but it's not my fault that other members of the conservative party didn't support the bill"".

Alternatively, I seem to recollect something about a retired police horse and the Chipping Norton Set, so it may be that Cameron does want the bill to go through, but he knows that there's no enough support for it within the party. If he employed the whip and a sizeable number of backbenchers repelled then it would weaken his position as leader.

My point is 24% of the electorate want a right-wing government. Over 30% want a left-wing government. The left-wing is splintered. FPTP only works to serve the Conservatives at the moment. I don't think it's a correct description to say the majority wants a Conservative government.

Even if we take out the non-voters there's more votes for the left but this doesn't translate well to seats. Partly because the left has a lot of options. If there was some way for people to take second choices into account and to have a more proportional voting system the left would be doing better off.

They've been punished overzealously but not unpredictably so, and surely that itself is proof that in the long-term they did not ""do the right thing"".



The coalition has resulted in the loss of LD political identity, public rejection of electoral reform and a catastrophic loss of almost all their major figures. The kind of stuff that will set them back a generation, there will be no liberal voice in the UK in the near future. The snoopers charter is back and we now no longer have the LDs to provide a powerful liberal voice like they have in the past.


A strong majority coalition government has almost certainly meant a more stable economy. But they could have had at least a couple of public disagreements to maintain their identity! In 2010 the German coalition government almost collapsed due to disagreement between coalition partners - but the German economy didn't tank due to uncertainty or instability. A minority government or vote-by-vote agreement, or even the 'rainbow coalition' which would probably have delivered them AV (Labour promised they would implement it) would have been better for the LDs and liberalism in general, even if it had meant a slightly weaker performance from the economy.

There are plenty of parties in the UK that are more principled than the LibDems. What you want to say, without saying it, is that you're the only party out of Labour, yourselves and the Tories. Perpetuating the problems as they exist.

The LibDems are in no small way responsible for the current political make up of this Union. They were instrumental in the failure of the left in '83 to mount a challenge to Thatcher, creating the basis for New Labour. 

The LibDems were planning on repeating exactly what they did last government, the gamble just didn't pay off, and now they've painted themselves as horrible martyrs, the dented shield against the Tory sledgehammer that the UK desperately needs but wont get. It's a load of crap.

Personally I'd say when you start earning £70-90k as a family with 1 child that would be on the boarder of rich where i came from (of course this depends on area because this is pretty poor for say London).

As someone who lived in a small town (15,000 people) my dad (mom doesn't work) took in roughly £25,000 with no mortgage to pay and 1 child and I'd say we were okay but they are in no position to pay for my fees out of pocket.

**Clarification:** I'd like to clarify that when i want the rich to pay more i don't want them to pay upfront but rather to take out a loan which would then have to be paid back, the rate of paying back should then be family means tested again. So for example lets say someone gets no grants, but takes a course and doesn't end up with a high paying job after, under the current system he doesn't have to pay back much at all. 9% of every £1 over £21,000 per year, if they was a sliding scale again where those who were given no grant then had to start paying back 10%, 11%, upto say 20% (as a sort of graduate tax), depending on the income of their parents. 

This is because of the reality that those that are poorer who also will not be able to get a well paying job will not be able to pay back all of their loans and we end up in a situation where the cost of education rises sharply, which must be curtailed in some way. This shouldn't punish those who fall under the bracket of income such as those of smaller buisness owners, head teachers etc. Again i havn't done economics I'm mearly a first year student studying Chemistry (explains my STEM bias earlier).

You get flash is the pan parties like UKIP every so often, they tend to pick up a few votes here and there either on specific issues or just from people who want a protest vote. Typically many of the candidates don't have the experience or even the qualities to be an MP.

UKIP only managed to get one constituency to actually vote to be represented by them. They couldn't even find a safe seat for Farage. Would it really help anyone to gave 82 mainly clueless MPs, who nobody has actually asked to be represented by, fucking things up in Parliament?

This isn't exactly the death of democracy. I am sure the main parties are taking a close look at their policies to make sure they don't get even more votes next time. We might well get a referendum on the EU, and some kind of change on immigration (if it is even a problem). And if we don't, maybe UKIP will actually win some seats next time.

Let me give examples.

In around 2003ish Ikea applied to the council for permission to build a store near Meadowhall close to the M1, the council refused because they wanted them to build a store within the city centre despite the fact that Ikea don't do that and have never done that and theres no room for that. Ikea went to court for restriction of trade and applied for permission for a site on the Parkway which was much closer to the city centre and which they said was a fair compromise. Sheff Council refused and said Ikea were being unreasonable and didn't want to invest in the city, the whole thing has been in court and was only resolved last year. Ikea will build near Meadowhall.

Next wanted to build the largest Next Home store in the country near Meadowhall, again the council said they wanted to keep retail within the city centre and tried to take it to court. Next cited the Ikea case as precedent stating they wanted go invest in jobs and retail and regenerate an area of wasteland and got the ruling in their favour in less than a year.

The council unveiled a scheme called Sevenstones in alliance with the retail builders Hammerstones. This would rebuild the rundown shopping street The Moor from top to bottom, new shops, bars, restaurants, a shopping mall, street furniture and a website and a public unveiling were made to show how it would look, the council sank millions into it, Hammersons invested very little but would reap the rents. Then we waited and Hammersons ran and the council downscaled the whole project so now a small part of The Moor will be rebuilt using money loaned from Scottish Widows.

After Gatecrasher burnt down they left the city an d set up clubs all over the uk, there was an opportunity for them to return to Sheffield a few years ago but the council rejected the application based on complaints from Sheffield Theatre goers who claimed they wouldn't be comfortable with a nightclub down the road despite the fact the Crucible and Lyceum are across the road from the O2 academy.

And on and on and on. Sheffield council don't have to bring better shops, bars and nightclubs to the city but they don't exactly create an environment that screams that the place is open for business either",null,0,null,1431198690,null,0,false,0,cr3t4xy,null,t3_35dxz5,null,t1_cr3t4xy,null,t1_cr3s8d3,null,null,null,1432865599,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

null,false,CaptainHayashi,,Labour Member,null,"I dunno... It just seems that every time my CLP holds meetings, I'm either too busy with my PhD studies to get to them, or it's just a bit logistically difficult to do so.  When I was in school, I lived locally, had all of the evenings comfortably off, and had a massive summer holiday where I had literally nothing to stop me from getting involved.  And I already had a friend from school also joining the party at the same time, so we kinda went around as a unit for a while.

_That's_ why I'd strongly recommend OP joins Labour early on.  Having four years of being able to come to meetings without worrying about time pressures is a good head start on things.  But I'm not writing off everyone over 18, of course.  I suppose it depends on where/how often your CLP meets, and what your job situation is!

Part of my problem is that I still feel more attached to my local CLP (Harrogate and Knaresborough) than the university one (York/York Outer).  I imagine it gets a lot easier in areas where Labour are just slightly more competitive (so meetings aren't as rare as once every two months), but where the CLP are still small and locally-minded enough to bend over backwards to welcome new members (like H&amp;K).  York is a much more well-oiled political machine and to be honest it puts me off a bit!

Don't suppose you could find a source? I've seen ones indicating this number of increase in employment, but that includes 200,000 simply by a change in register, as well as making it compulsory to stay in education until 18 resulting in lots taking up apprenticeships. I don't doubt that there has been job creation, I'm simply skeptical, especially with the unprecedented rise in zero hour contracts as well as the increase in self employment due to poor wages.

&gt;Using data 2 years old

Actually, very recent data. [Journalist article](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/05/uk-living-standards-fell-for-all-but-the-richest-under-coalition-analysis), [Primary source](http://www.poverty.ac.uk/editorial/uk-living-standards-pse-election-briefing). I quote from the briefing - 'There is only one conclusion that can be drawn from the available scientific evidence – the majority of the UK population has suffered from a fall in their living standards during the current government’s term of office. Both the poor and the majority have indeed ‘all been in it together’ - only the richest appear to have escaped'.

&gt;Meanwhile, income inequality has fallen

I have taken the time to read that source, and it's reasoning behind income inequality falling is, I quote:

 'The primary reason for the fall in inequality was that real earnings fell sharply'. 

Further on the source claims: 

'There is good reason to think that the falls in income inequality since 2007–08 are
currently being reversed.' 

It believes income inequality will increase as tax credits and benefits cuts are aimed at the lower income thresholds. The source also further provides evidence for a drop in living standards.

""Headline figures from the HBAI series show a large drop in living standards between 2009–10 and 2012–13"" 

&gt;a better way of addressing overall inequality in in the long term

That is not really a source, it's simply simulated graphs and economic speculation by two economists. I agree that the raised person allowance is a step in the right direction.

&gt; higher taxes on the rich never raise the money they are expected to make

Scandinavia is a perfect example of why this isn't true. High corporation tax, high competition, high productivity. I'm also not sure that source therefore means opposition tax plans are a 'punitive measure for the rich to win votes from the disillusioned.'

&gt;Can I ask why you don't agree we should have referendums on matters of public interest?

I think that education in this country is too poor to have referendums on extremely important topics, and the media has far too much biased influence on this. Nevertheless I would likely be forced to begrudgingly agree referendums are needed, just to keep things democratic.

The real question is would the votes come out in the same manner that a UKIP/Conservative coalition would have been made, god knows what that would be like.

null,false,JohnnyButtocks,scot-orkney,Orkney,null,"What happens is, Scotland is divided into 73 constituencies, and 8 regions. So my constituency is Orkney, and I get a single constituency MSP (lib dem at present). 

But I am also represented by 7 additional MSPs, added via the regional list. So my region is the Highlands and Islands, which elected to the list 2 Labour ministers, 2 Conservatives, 1 SNP and 2 independents. These ministers all represent me in parliament, but my constituency MSP is the one who is expected to have the most intimate knowledge of my immediate local issues.

This is great because quite often the list MSP's belong to parties which are the electors' second preference, which gives a more nuanced reflection of voters desires. It also means, if I was a conservative, though I would be unlikely to ever have a local constituency MSP in any Highlands seat, I would still have a regional representative, belonging to my chosen party, who understood my political concerns and issues, and had the voice to raise them at parliament. 

All MSP's are treated as having equal voice and status in parliament. The Tory party leader in Scotland is, by necessity, a list MSP for example. The Tories only have 3 constituency MSPs at Holyrood, but, via the regional list, their total number rises to 15 MSPs, which amounts to about 13% of the total seats, which is within 2 percentage points of their share of the popular vote. So in practice, it is a very proportional, very representative system, IMO.

""As members of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons we submit therefore that
hunting by hounds is the natural and most humane way of controlling the population of
all four quarry species, fox, deer, hare and mink, in the countryside. Humane, since at all
times the wild animal remains in its natural environment and the relatively short period of
physiological stress that may be suffered in the final phase of the hunt, followed by the
almost instantaneous kill must be the preferred method of culling a wild animal. Hunting
produces no wounded survivors. Hunting is the only method of culling that selectively
maintains the health and vigour of the species and which allows the quarry species respite
during the breeding season. Hunting is environmentally friendly to both the quarry
species and to other wildlife. It is the natural, balanced, biological method of controlling
wildlife, proven over centuries.""",null,0,null,1431199241,null,0,false,1,cr3te76,null,t3_35egc1,null,t1_cr3te76,null,t1_cr3qxna,null,null,null,1432865720,null,26,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,26,null

I know I could easily afford to pay a mortgage if I could buy somewhere, even in London.  I have £27k in savings and, so far, have spent nearly £20k renting over the past 31 months or so - £47k total would have been a very sexy sum.

Currently, I'm renting a flat worth approximately £100k for £595pcm (575 rent, 20 on top for water rates).  Even dropping the £27k right now would give me a potential £73k mortgage, if I were to pay that off at the same £575pcm it would take me 10 years and 6 months to own this place outright.  Keeping my current savings regimen would mean that I'd have recouped my original savings balance x 3 by the time the mortgage term ended, as well as the £x equity depending on the flat's value at that point.

Had I the potential £47k, it would have been a £53k mortgage; again, at £575pcm, we're talking being mortgage free a full three years earlier after just 7 years and 6 months.  Sell, and buy somewhere better with a slightly larger deposit, save or invest the leftover cash.

The difference is in your scenario the next twenty years sees more spending, where in mine every single years beyond that for the rest of time sees higher spending. That means more benefits, more services, more defence, and more money left in peoples pockets. It isn’t just government revenue that benefits, it is everyone, and economic growth has done a better job of lifting billions out of poverty than every other measure combined. In short; choosing not to elevate the act of moralising over the act of being moral.

null,false,ppphhh,null,null,null,"Plenty of good explanations already but it's worth noting that most cars will have at least some time left on the MOT when you buy them. You could buy one today for instance and not need to MOT it until August. You can buy a car without it but that's normally a reliability red flag. You should get a physical MOT certificate with the car, it's a bit of paper that looks like [this](http://www.motuk.com/LARGE_MOT.jpg). You can renew it a month before the expiry date (book an appointment at a garage) but if you don't, you can't legally drive *except* to an MOT test. If the rozzers catch you they'll check if you've got one booked.

With the car you will also get a [V5](https://www.fleetrisk24.com/uploads/Images/v5c_indicator.jpg) document which is an A4 leaflet type thing. I forget the exact process but either you or the previous owner need to fill in part of it and send it to the DVLA, the form will explain what to do and it's pretty simple.

Legally you *can* buy a vehicle without the physical documents and send off for new ones but again, red flag. Someone who can't keep two bits of paper safe probably isn't going to be on top of their car's maintenance.

From the moment of sale you need to tax and insure the vehicle. Insurance you can and should arrange in advance. You can't tax the car until you have the V5 but you can do it online in a matter of minutes. If you buy from a private seller rather than a garage it's worth arranging to use his computer to tax it, if you don't have a smartphone.

Tax varies by vehicle but costs roughly £150 a year for a smallish car. MOTs cost £55 (legal maximum price) assuming nothing needs fixing. Insurance varies wildly, if you're under 25 it can be £1000, if you're older (and have some no claims bonus) it might be as low as £200 per year.

As for the season objectives:

&gt;Failure in UCL in easy group.
 
There's no such thing as an easy group. We didn't perform against Ludogorets and that cost us, but Basel/Real Madrid aren't easy opponents by any stretch.

&gt; Losing to Chelsea in League Cup semi final

We played fantastically in both legs, and I'd go as far as saying we were the better team both times. We were unlucky not to go through.

&gt; Losing to Aston Villa in FA cup semi final

I'll concede that one, the team didn't turn up whatsoever and we didn't deserve anything out of it. However, two semi-finals isn't exactly terrible - there's not much more you can do from there than win one of them. Obviously that's the goal, but if not winning a trophy is a sign of failure then a lot of teams are in a lot of trouble.

&gt; Crashing out of the Europa League

Yeah, that was weird. To be honest, I don't think the players or Rodgers wanted to be in the competition. Before the last game, he said something to the effect of ""let's just see what happens and it doesn't matter either way"". I suppose he wanted to avoid the extra games to focus on top 4. Guess that backfired.

&gt; failing to get top 4

This is the only thing we can really be disappointed by. United and City have both been very subpar this season. We've had so many chances to catch up, but we've thrown so many points against teams we needed to be beating.

&gt; He can blame the transfer committee all he wants. He has made most of his own signings, he failed to get his players to show up.

The latter I could agree with to an extent, but confidence plays a part as well. If the players lack confidence, even a good manager would struggle to get the best out of them. It's been a very weird season, and loathe as I am to say it, it's been a transitional season for us. We lost one of the best players in the world and we've had a lot of new players to try and fit into the club.

As for the first part about Rodgers making signings, what evidence do you have of that? The same applies for people saying the committee are making all the calls. We don't know what goes on behind the scenes, or who has the most say in signings. I've been saying for a while that I honestly don't feel that Rodgers wanted Balotelli for example, judging by the way he seems to be treated.

&gt;Someone has to answer for this season

You're right. But it isn't one individual. Rodgers has made poor tactical decisions, players haven't turned up when they needed to, the transfer team made some bad signings. 

Reading between the lines, I'd guess you're in the Rodgers out camp. I can't stress how much that'd be a bad thing for the club. We need stability right now; shaking everything up with a new manager will not achieve that. 

If, this time next season, we're in a similar situation, having made bad signings and underperformed when we needed to, I could see it happen. I just don't believe that Rodgers would be forced out after losing a key asset like Suarez having come the closest to winning the league that I've seen in my lifetime.",null,1,null,1431199875,null,0,false,0,cr3tojp,null,t3_35f3rh,null,t1_cr3tojp,null,t3_35f3rh,null,null,null,1432865856,null,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

&gt;Mental health service cuts

I didn't mention cuts, I meant a lack of attention. Labour was guilty of this previously, however them, the Lib Dems and the Greens emphasised a need for dramatic change in their manifestos. The Tory's did not. I'm not sure if you've had any experience with mental health problems, or know someone who has. If not, just have a conversation with any psychiatrist to find out the current shambolic state of it. I don't have time to refind my source but a flick through any of the UK based charities such as Mind will show the extent of this.

And rather than promoting integration, we'll push for social ghettos, even at the level of justice. Helping promoting the idea (regardless of how accurate) that they entitled to their own courts, religious nontheless, and be judged by their own people who they trust.

&gt;  the same law can be interpreted differently by different people/organisations 

And the last thing I would want is to introduce a strong bias intro the system. Particularly one where the end goal may well become not to judge by British law, or follow the spirit of the law, but to judge according to Sharia the best you're allowed to or can get away with. 

I don't want arbitrations to become exercises creative interpretation of laws to fit prejudices, or where witness arguments are cherry picked in order to justify a pre-determined verdict.

To make matters worse, remember civil cases , which can be dramatic themselves, often hid darker realities such as domestic abuse. Which can be judged in arbitration, but can be detected and should be reported.

This isn't pessimism. It's disingenuous to  ignore the kind of culture we're dealing with. The fact that not all people are the same, and that many Muslims are very well adjusted, doesn't change that it is a particularly problematic community. With it comes a lot of fundamentalism, a lot of unwillingness to integrate, and a religion and religiously-fundamental sense of justice that doesn't fit our society.

There's also been an anti-austerity rally in Cardiff of around 200 people including Charlotte Church.

Nobody (within reason) is denying that the Tory government is a legitimate/democratic one under a FPTP system (and even a reformed one) but people still want to see a shift in policy. This government was elected on the pledge of £12 billion cuts to working age benefits and if protest can help reduce that figure by any measure (preferably to zero) people are of course going to speak out.

Just wanted to add my 2 pennies as most people seem to think that it's strictly about opposing the government instead of the governments actions. 

As the top comment says: ""There's nothing they can do."" and that's true with respect to the election results but people can still call for less austerity and electoral reform.

**Sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen** - isotretinoin is photosensitising (makes you very sensitive to sun damage). That means high factor, broad spectrum, applying *and reapplying*: first layer twenty minutes before you go outdoors, second half to one hour after the first, then at least every two hours of exposure after that.

Always the recommended amount (half teaspoon for face and neck, full shot glass for body), rain/ cloud/ sun/ next to a window or in a car. Yes that is loads and no it won't rub in easily: don't panic just spread it evenly as you can and let it settle in.  The sunscreen may start off white and streaky but will vanish as it dries and absorbs.

UV rays can penetrate cloud, glass, clothing, bounce off water, concrete, snow, even find you in the shade. You must be using sunscreen from day one, do not start isotretinoin without this. You would not just be risking sunburn but damage that could lead to cancer or rosacea (lifelong facial skin condition with lots of redness and discomfort, a bit like eczema and acne all in one).

Second switch to **super gentle shower gel and shampoo,** that might even resolve your eczema (it did mine) or at least make it less stingy/ burny. Harsh anionic surfactants thin, dehydrate and damage the skin barrier. **No sulphates, no olefin sulfonates, no fragrance.** I recommend carrying a small bottle to use as handwash - no public bathroom stuff.

The simplest/ gentlest foaming products I can think of are Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash (NOT the moisturising), Boots Simply Sensitive Foaming Wash, NaturallyThinking Extra Mild Sulphate Free shower gel/ shampoo. Naturally Thinking is online only: the two products are virtually identical so you can use either one for body and hair, you don't need two separate products. Both the Boots and Simple washes can be found cheap enough that you could use those for face and body (I do) even tho they are only marketed for face.

Getting those two in place is your start, you don't want to introduce numerous new skincare products at once or you will not know what helps and what worsens. Worry about moisturisers once you have these sorted, I know that sounds backwards but honestly harsh cleansing products may be causing or contributing to some of your skin issues. Some sunscreens moisturise anyway, so you might find you don't need a separate moisturiser for daytime.",null,0,null,1431200813,null,0,1431201320,0,cr3u4az,null,t3_35eh83,null,t1_cr3u4az,null,t3_35eh83,null,null,null,1432866063,null,2,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,2,null

In my area I'm the only active young person for the local ward, though none of the older folks are grumpy in the slightest, they’re a very friendly bunch of people that care about the area.  At the very local level I get a bit of input into the leaflets that get posted through doors, and I volunteer to drop a few off when I have the time, I probably average out at an hour a week plus meetings. 

Something you might not enjoy about local politics is that it’s largely concerned with very small issues, things like “Can the local council find money to pay a park keeper?” and stuff like that. It’s not exactly influencing foreign policy but it makes a big difference to people near you and it’s the first way that you’ll get to see how campaigning leads to pressure on politicians, which leads to change.

However, over the whole parliamentary constituency there are a couple of hundred active members, quite a few of them are roughly my age. During Election Day we were out in pairs knocking on the doors of people who said they would consider voting Labour and reminding them to please remember to do it. It since seems to have made no difference whatsoever, but it was a fairly fun way to spend the day, chatting to people about Labour. We have a party/wake coming up to thank people for volunteering and to mourn for the result, which should be fun.

So basically you can choose how much to do, and even pick and choose which parts you find most fun. You’ll meet a bunch of friendly people who are interested in the same stuff as you, and it feels pretty good to spend time drawing attention to local issues.

Focus on getting student fees down in the UK, because even outside Erasmus we have no issue receiving and getting our own students to other universities.  We have some of the best in the world - there'll always be a deal on the table from countries wanting its students to be able to get access to the best.

Close parity on tuition fees would be an issue but most of the EU has far cheaper tuition fees than the UK, and it's not the EU's doing.  More parity, more options.

The actual mobility of students is not freedom of movement for labour (or even the ability to look for labour).  It's the freedom of student visas, and Erasmus is available outside the EU and provides that.

&gt;The devil's in the detail though. Will our sales team and service engineers find it as easy to visit Paris or Brussels? 

YES.  (I actually live most of the year in France)

Before the EU and still for those outside it there is 6 month visa-free travel.

You can't become a resident without applying as you do now, and you'd need a work visa for anything longer than 6 months at a time without leaving at some point (so permanent work based in a country), but your sales team and engineers will either be wooshing in and out, even if they stay for 4 months at a time, or your company will simply apply for a temporary work visa for them.  Actually moving in and out of the country months at a time won't be a problem.

They'll need passports, as the do now, but in terms of being able to visit the EU there will be no problem whatsoever.  Nobody wants to stop trade.

I agree with you though that the idea of doing it for sport, or as a jolly with your mates seem cruel. 

The ban seems to be an almost unenforceable law that was pushed through without much thought to logic. 

It was probably there to primiarly pursue a political class-divide agenda - to paint country people (tory voters) as bloodthirsty participants in mass scale organised animal cruelty, and therefore anyone who opposed the bill - tory MPs, as enabling these animal abusers. I mean, who can't empathise with the idea of a cute fluffy fox being ripped to shreds by a pack of hungry hounds?

If we were really concerned about animal cruelty we would take offence at the millions of animals slaughtered inhumanely each year by not pre-stunning them before religious ritual slaughter for halal/kosher meat. An adult cow takes 40-50 seconds to lose consciousness after it's throat is cut, 144 million animals are slaughtered every year in this country for Halal meat alone.

When people argue that FPTP is incorrect I think that they simply don't understand the way that it is supposed to work, when you vote for a representative it is a single person that is sent to represent the ideas and feelings of a certain are within the government and you should not be voting for a party, nor a leader but you should vote for the person that you believe would do best.

The issue is that the people voting don't see it as a chance to vote for a person to represent you but see it as a way to put the party backing them in power or maybe putting the leader of that party in power.

They have loads of potential, but not a single one is world-class at this point. We have an incredible amount of potential in the squad, but that's all it is, potential. Give Brendan's signings some time to adjust to the league and develop. Some players come into the EPL and are hits right away, others take time.

At this point last year there were threads talking about how poor Coutinho's shooting was, and now he's scored some of the best and most important goals of the season. We were also talking about what a great job Brendan had done in bringing out the most of undervalued players not too long ago, Sturridge being the prime example. 

As a club and as fans, we need to accept that we are not a top four team at this moment. Could we be in a year or two? Absolutely. But right now we are simply below that standard.

I agree that corporations should pay their due tax. However it is important to realise that it is not 'fraud' and it is not the companies avoiding tax by breaking the law.

My first time drinking Buckfast was when I was 17. It's maybe the only memorable time I've drank it. My friend and I were down on the coast near Portstewart. We'd walked from Coleraine drinking a bottle of Mundies (5 quid tramp wine) on the way. I'd felt like I'd cheated the world, it had been a lovely sunny summer evening and to have such a dander felt like a real blessing in a somewhat cranky adolescence. We were planning on heading into O'Haras (now defunct, turned into a wain's nightclub called Havana) after for drinks. I untwisted the Buckfast expecting nothing particularly special, then a pungent scent grabbed me by the face and refused to let go. It was like drinking a BP Oil spill. The sensation of syrup and petrol twisted a knot in my stomach like I'd never quite experienced before. It'd turned dark and I found myself on a beach, with a dude, vomiting a lurid fountain into the air, a fountain so syrupy dense I'm surprised it didn't collapse in on itself. Pretty sure we went to O'Haras and I went with some doll after.

Private healthcare organisations within a single payer or (God help you) multiple payer systems provide an extra positive pressure on overall costs as they adhere to margins as opposed to pure operating costs. 
If you have trouble visualising this, think about the rail services whose anual rise in ticket prices outstrip inflation yoy by like 100%. That is to say, they will ask for more money than they need simply because they can.
another way to visualise it is that the NHS now pays people to do stuff, however should you privatise the healthcare services the NHS will start paying people to pay people to do stuff (and take a cut in the process).",null,0,null,1431202588,null,0,false,0,cr3uya4,null,t3_35ecf7,null,t1_cr3uya4,null,t3_35ecf7,null,null,null,1432866454,null,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10,null

People from richer backgrounds aren't eligable for any grants so to get through uni their parents are already expected to finance them a little bit (a very flawed system imo, parents are under no obligation to finance their kids at uni so some people may end up living off peanuts if their parents don't help out). As for the cost of uni you don't pay anything back until you graduate, there is no financial barrier for entry, anyone can get the £9000 paid for by loan, grants exist in maintenance because students need the money now and so poorer kids may be put off uni if they know they won't be able to go a year without working, that isn't an issue with the tuition fees because they aren't paid back for years. 

The second part of your plan sounds horrible if I've understood it right, rather than scheduling repayment plans based around what the graduate's income is you want to base it off what their parent's earn? How does that make any sense? Employers aren't going to look at two prospective employees with similar qualifications and then decide to pick person A because his dad is rich, why do you think graduates with richer parents will raise tuition fees higher if they don't get a well paid job? Why does that logic not apply to a poorer kid when both people currently have the same student loan repayment plan? Even if the guy with rich parents did get a good job through his dad's connections he'd be paying his loan back faster because of that anyway. Meanwhile if a kid from a well off background couldn't get a good job he gets punished just because his parents were more successful than him? Why? Most parents aren't going to fund their kids once they graduate, so how are they going to afford these higher repayment rates if they don't acquire a good job? 

&gt; This is because of the reality that those that are poorer who also will not be able to get a well paying job will not be able to pay back all of their loans

I really don't understand that line, if a kid from a rich background doesn't get a good job he won't be able to pay back the loan either, why is this only a concern for kids from poorer backgrounds?

null,false,Chlorophilia,null,null,null,"&gt;I value freedom over safety, the attitude extends to others. Besides the fact that taxation is becoming more and more impractical to enforce, and regardless of who the tax is on, it ends up on regular people.
I was not born into any sort of privilege, although I am fine-ish now. Hopefully better in the future. Not that my background should be of any particular interest.

If you think I'm trying to restrict freedom, then you and I are using very different definitions of freedom. Taxation isn't a device to restrict freedom, it's a device to distribute freedom from the people who have it in abundance to those who have very little. I think the freedom for everyone to have access to high quality public services is more important than the freedom of a small number of people to continue growing their vast wealth at the expense of everyone else. Taxation is necessary if you believe in the greatest freedom for the greatest number of people. The system you're advocating gives a huge amount of freedom to a very small number of people, and screws over the vast majority.

&gt;I've already discussed this, I don't believe that any public service in recent history has been truly privatized. Even railways (which I would say have improved, but I lack firsthand experience) are only a bastardized form of half-privatization.
Although there have been some experiments elsewhere, for example a US town (Texas, IIRC) hired a private security firm and chucked out their police force. Crime went down and it cost less.

Few services might adhere to your strict definition of privatisation but the simple fact that all of the steps towards it have resulted in catastrophe strongly indicates that the end result will be bad too. You have absolutely *zero* evidence that privatisation will result in anything good, yet we have plenty of evidence that nationalisation is a good thing since all services in developed countries have reached their peak under nationalisation and have gone into decline whenever attempts have been made to reverse that. I don't understand what's so difficult to understand about that.

And giving a vague example of privatisation in a single town in Texas isn't particularly helpful, not least because I can't find any kind of information about it (a google search mainly brings up results about the privatisation of the US prison system which is a textbook example of how privatisation results in the destruction of human rights and dignity).

&gt;I can't give you any, because I don't believe there has been any. I don't see any difference between healthcare and a consumer service, as it shares many characteristics.

If you have no reason to believe that privatisation will work, why do you support it? And what characteristics to integral services such as healthcare share with frivolous consumer items, seriously? 

&gt;I have no clue why you would think there would be economic collapse without intervention. My company works very hard to remain un-intervined and receive no support whatsoever and does fine. As does the wider group. The vast majority of companies receive little support from the government.
While some larger 'to big to fail' companies would collapse, this is really darwinism. Banks can't take some of the risks they did if they have no-one to bail them out - not that it would stop some of them. Their collapse of course just creates new opportunity for competition.

Just think about what would have happened in the financial crash if bail-outs hadn't happened. The entire system supporting global business was in free-fall and the only thing stopping that free-fall was government intervention. You may call that darwinism but I don't see why you think that's an excuse. This ""economic darwinism"" would have resulted in millions of people having their lives ruined (of course, millions of peoples' livelihoods were ruined by the financial crash even with government intervention but they would have been even more ruined without). It's very easy to detach yourselves from these people if you analyse what happened like a textbook but we're talking about peoples' lives here.

Four to six years from now we will get into a recession, this recession will be localized to the UK, but America will feel it as well as parts of the EU.

What will this recession be? Houses.

Now, to back this up, I want you to look at the current base rate, which is 0.5%, with most mortgages having interests of 3-5% fixed rate for 5 years. Now, if this base rate goes up, which last time I heard BoE said it would be between 1.4-1.8% (or possibly 2%) this will have a domino effect on mortgages. 

Some people will be lucky, and still have a fixed rate, others may have enough money to weather the storm (which I feel is why the government is trying to get people to save), but I feel a reasonable number of people will either have to sell up, or foreclose on the house they purchased because they now have to pay a increased mortgage rate on payments of a few hundred grand. 

If you do the maths, this can be an huge increase in monthly repayments.. and I feel this ,with the other squeezes on cost of living will be the next cause of the recession.. 

On the other hand, no base rate increase, and a deflationary spiral could also cause a recession. Either way, I feel in 5 years (if not sooner when we see the warning lights go off like the previous recession), the UK is in for a world of fuckery.

And the 1997 election had less prominent losers with large scale support - although the referendum party getting 2.6% of the votes and no representation *should* have been an issue. The libdems were also hugely under-represented, but they *were* raising the issue back in 1987.

In this election, there's a lot more voters with their voices unfairly silenced. In 1997, 90.7% of votes went to Labour, Conservative, or Libdem. 629 MPs, 90% of the vote. 629 was 95% of the 659 seats, So the final numbers are 95% of MPs, 90% of the votes.

In 2015, 619 MPs are from Labour, Conservative, and SNP, with 72% of the vote. Even if you add in the *(grossly under-represented)* Libdems, you have 627 Mps with 80% of the vote. 96.4% of the MPs, with 80% of the vote.

See how it's objectively worse?

It's a bit confusing due to the changing nature of the underrepresented but still third place parties, so what if we slim those out? And just look at Labour and Conservatives - the two usual big winners of FPTP. Then we get this:

1997 : 583 (88.5%) MPs elected, 73.9% of the vote.

2015 :563 (86.6%) of MPs elected, 67.3% of the vote.

Again, objectively worse. 1997's Mp share:vote share ratio is 1.2:1. 2015's is 1.29:1.

Two victories. Britain is not right wing, but very centrist, and even this government is to the left of the US Democrats, let alone the Republicans. The triumph and tragedy of the LibDems is that their position is the UK mainstream, economically and socially liberal, but that made them unnecessary.
4. They'll draw the wrong lesson from the campaign, but look at the result. The most vicious personal attack on Ed Milliband across the campaign, and on Nick Clegg for the past five years. Result? Ed's popularity went up, and Clegg was one of only eight LibDems to survive. Negative campaigning doesn't work.Capitalising on Labour surrendering on the issue of the economy, and Redkippers angry about Labour not offering an EU referendum? Different matter.
5. For Labour, a governing coalition with a solid majority has been replaced by a governing party with a weaker one. They devastated the other coalition party, and unlike in 1982 their losses were to a rival on the left, not to the Tories. 1992, the best parallel, was followed by 1997.
6. If your quality of life is tolerable now: policies will not greatly change, while the economy will continue to improve mainly by itself. That last one should make life better for most whatever the government does.
7. As we saw in the election and the Scottish referendum, people often break for the status quo when faced with a ballot box. Eurosceptic s aren't shy, but polls put the great majority as wanting to stay in the EU. Draw your own conclusions for 2017.

While Labour lick their wounds, and many of us lament the continuation of policies we disagree with passionately, its worth remembering that democracy has spoken, and that we just lived through a historical moment to remember. Life will go on, we are not governed by anything as extreme as the American mainstream.
Just my thoughts.

I'm not the one who removed the post, and as it happens, I've not yet even made my mind up about what I think of it yet (since I see both sides of the argument quite clearly). I'm a little busy right now so I can't get into discussing the actual rules in the next hour or two but I felt I needed to remind people of a few things before it begins properly:

1. Meta posts like this are always permitted. We do not stop discussion about the moderation of posts and welcome it! :) You can always modmail us things and PM me personally if you wish (though I do have a PM backlog to go through due to coursework!). 

2. Given previous experience with similar threads: As /u/brainburger put it, ""the mods mean well"". No matter how much you disagree with a rule, please do not insult us. Our methods are what you may or may not disagree with, but I believe we all share the same goals. Which brings also me onto....

3. Insulting us, or other users, does not help your case. That includes being passive aggressive. There's a great chance that we will ignore it. You're discussing the rules (with nice clear reasons!), not us. 

4. Sorry /u/brainburge, but when we approve/remove posts, we don't give a crap who you are, unless you're like a writer on the show posting an AMA that the bot hates (oops), and that's the way it should be as doing otherwise would be really unfair on other users, wouldn't you say? You are a great submitter, there's no doubt about that!

null,false,williamdunne,null,null,null,"&gt;If you think I'm trying to restrict freedom, then you and I are using very different definitions of freedom. Taxation isn't a device to restrict freedom, it's a device to distribute freedom from the people who have it in abundance to those who have very little. I think the freedom for everyone to have access to high quality public services is more important than the freedom of a small number of people to continue growing their vast wealth at the expense of everyone else. Taxation is necessary if you believe in the greatest freedom for the greatest number of people. The system you're advocating gives a huge amount of freedom to a very small number of people, and screws over the vast majority.

The personal freedom of not being taxed I am applying to all people, not just the rich. Everyone should have the right to spend the entirety of their earnings without violence being threatened against them.

Removing taxation would of course reduce the cost of all consumer goods in the process.

&gt;Few services might adhere to your strict definition of privatisation but the simple fact that all of the steps towards it have resulted in catastrophe strongly indicates that the end result will be bad too. You have absolutely zero evidence that privatisation will result in anything good, yet we have plenty of evidence that nationalisation is a good thing since all services in developed countries have reached their peak under nationalisation and have gone into decline whenever attempts have been made to reverse that. I don't understand what's so difficult to understand about that.

&gt;And giving a vague example of privatisation in a single town in Texas isn't particularly helpful, not least because I can't find any kind of information about it (a google search mainly brings up results about the privatisation of the US prison system which is a textbook example of how privatisation results in the destruction of human rights and dignity).

I don't believe that sub-contracting counts as privatization to any extent. The role is still being supervised by a single entity, and carried out by a single entity.

&gt;If you have no reason to believe that privatisation will work, why do you support it? And what characteristics to integral services such as healthcare share with frivolous consumer items, seriously? 

Because it works in every non-government function?

Consumer items are not ""frivolous"" and often more complex than medicine/other public functions. Chip fabrication is more complex than surgery, and I can hire private security. The NHS sucks in many regards, including access to more expensive treatments. A friends father recently had to fly to California to get treatment for his prostate cancer (was essentially going to die if stayed in the UK) that involved using Gold to concentrate chemotherapy. This was not available on the NHS, and he is now healthy.


&gt;Just think about what would have happened in the financial crash if bail-outs hadn't happened. The entire system supporting global business was in free-fall and the only thing stopping that free-fall was government intervention. You may call that darwinism but I don't see why you think that's an excuse. This ""economic darwinism"" would have resulted in millions of people having their lives ruined (of course, millions of peoples' livelihoods were ruined by the financial crash even with government intervention but they would have been even more ruined without). It's very easy to detach yourselves from these people if you analyse what happened like a textbook but we're talking about peoples' lives here. You can't just gamble around with lives like they're worthless.

Not much would have happened outside of a few businesses and banks failing. Banks failing would be the biggest issue, but without government intervention there would be far less concentration on the usage of banks.

You're not very smart if you think that business would just stop, drop the mic, and leave without governments bailing out banks.",null,0,null,1431205542,null,0,false,0,cr3wbkt,null,t3_35a56k,null,t1_cr3wbkt,null,t1_cr3v1d9,null,null,null,1432867171,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null
