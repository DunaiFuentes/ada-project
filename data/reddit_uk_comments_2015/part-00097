What do you want to do? What are your plans for the future? That should shape your investments &amp; goals here. 

If you're earning a lot more than you need, then you could be very close to being financially independent. Although you don't *have* to retire, it means you could at any point, or change jobs to something else you've wanted to do. 

&gt; My pension is invested in a spread of funds picked by an IFA I have a longstanding relationship with (he does this for free).

Are they a friend? Just wanted to check that they are actually an *independent* financial advisor. 

&gt; I max out my ISA allowance each year in a S&amp;S ISA which I manage through an IFA (the same guy mentioned above, though I pay fees on this)

Make sure you're getting a good return for your fees, do you know your funds and their costs? 

Other than that, you can contribute about another 12k to your pension which will get bumped up to £20k (I think reaching your £40k per year max). However, you'll need to watch out for hitting the lifetime limits.

Investing outside of that in taxable assets will be the next step, you can realise ~£11k of gains per year before being taxed. 

You can invest in things like VCTs or whatever the government flavour of the month is (there's usually some variety of tax efficient schemes for investing in smaller companies) which are a lot riskier but could be worth looking at if you've got a lot invested more safely.

You can invest in properties, but they do require time to manage and there are a bunch of parts of them that are taxable (any growth in the property, income above the interest on the mortgage).",null,0,null,1426333446,null,0,false,0,cpel0nr,null,t3_2yu5kn,null,t1_cpel0nr,null,t3_2yu5kn,null,null,null,1427756185,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

Go to a bank and ask for a certified copy. They'll copy it, stamp it, and I sent that copy to iWeb. I went to Halifax as iWeb is managed by Halifax Share Dealing.

You'll also need to pay a £25 opening fee, however from the 16th of March they'll increase the opening fee to £200. It might be worth sending the application, just to make sure you've entered the applications queue before the 16th of March.

After that you'll probably want to move some funds from your other ISA provider to iWeb. That can be done with [this form](http://www.iweb-sharedealing.co.uk/PDFs/IWeb_ISAManagerTransferForm.pdf) (make sure to use this, else you'll use your ISA allowance).

**TLDR**

1. Apply (ideally before 16th of March)
2. Send a certified copy of passport (e.g. certified by  Halifax)
3. Pay £25/£200 opening fee.
4. Transfer money from other ISA to iWeb with [this form](http://www.iweb-sharedealing.co.uk/PDFs/IWeb_ISAManagerTransferForm.pdf).

He was addicted to Tetris. He saw me or my brother on our old game boys once and then he had a go and was hooked. He'd hold the game boy wrong, though. Held in one hand and using one thumb for both the d-pad and buttons.

Yea, will be a few months before you can see your position SEO wise. What I more meant was that the way people search is changing, so it's less focused on keywords which the BBC etc will naturally outrank you on for say 'Conservatives' - but that's not how majority of users search now. 

So rather aiming to rank for that keyword, you aim for someone searching for 'What are the Conservatives plans on immigration?' and title it like that, and then google will more likely serve your content as it's more relevant to what they are searching. Then it's a case of getting enough of these posts out to cross reference everything, and get a couple of inbound links from authoritative sources, but just facebook and reddit will do early on, and you should start to see it grow. 

Aim is not so much to try and beat the big political blogs, but if you  focus on serving useful and relavent content for people looking for political information, then that will reflect further down the line.

&gt; I just don't know! 

&gt; I always enjoyed the drama of palace. Nothing is ever simple, everything a battle and I swear over the years we have have more highs and lows than most clubs. I always say I want us to win it all but without the hideous results that go with palace we couldn't have had dougies last minute minute winner at Stockport. The heart breaking fluky shot spinning off a shin against leicster in one playoff final that then made David Hopkin looking to curl one in the last minute promotion all the sweeter and who could forget spanking Brighton more often than not?! 

&gt; Off the pitch we've had so much drama too. I hate it at the time but would have had it any other way. The shocking lows have made the highs so special. 

&gt; Then comes cpfc2010. After the initial saving of the club dust settled it has been a remarkable upward trajectory. Crazy really when you look at how far we've come. Yet results have gone our way. We've been promoted when we started the season as many peoples faves for the drop. Manager walked yet we went up as the no hopers of the playoffs, beating Brighton along the way. 

&gt; We went up, holloway was woefull but to his credit he walked. We were down and out but the pulis revolution came along and it was an incredible turnaround, one of the best in premiership history. Then he walks.... The palace soap opera continues. 

&gt; This season, a bit of bad luck for warnock but I think it also showed his weakness and that was his lack of plan b to change a game. We were sinking... Somehow... Somehow because it was fabulous... SP &amp; co got pardew and the buzz at palace is fantastic again. Not done yet but we are on course. 

&gt; We are somehow getting the results now yet the last four years have been the best ever (in my time as a palace fan) 

&gt; I think I'm cautiously optimistic we can go forward and still be palace and still keep the clubs thrilling identity as such a unique club. If these guys come in SP &amp; co must remain to run things and ensure we don't become another plastic club to be racked and stacked in the premiership. If so this can be a very exciting time, it has to be done right but he who dares and all that...

Spot on. This is my Crystal Palace. It's a crazy club with huge highs and pitiful lows, and I want it to stay that way. I want our homegrown players in the first eleven, I want us to be this club tucked away in South East London that occasionally does something insane. Most of all, I want us to exist.

The Third Doctor and early Fourth Doctor are very similar to this style, but have a fair bit of padding in them.

All of this applies even more to the First and Second Doctor.

Chances are it won't be found tbh. Know a guy constantly get his bikes stolen in town. They'll stand with a rock/hammer in broad daylight and smash the lock mechanism till it breaks.
A local rat will flog the bike for cash to someone in the area for a price too good to turn down.
I've even heard of some more organised ones having the bikes transported somewhere else straight away. it's not possible to clear out a whole bike rack and sell it locally the same day, they are moving them to a different town/country maybe even warehousing them til sale.

Get a stupidly good lock, seriously just pay the money. Something that can withstand a rat smashing away at it (alarmed one would be nice). maybe even get three, 1 for each wheel to frame and frame to your dock.  Consider doing something to devalue the bike a lil so it's not first pick.  Some people remove the seat, the dutch will spray paint them silly colours so it's not got much resale value and easy to identify. File your initials clearly into the frame.

There's definitely room for another attacking midfielder in the squad, especially if Markovic and Ibe spend some more time in the wing-back positions.

It seems ridiculous to sign a first XI type of player and throw the hierarchy off, with Sterling probably not having to play up top next season he, Coutinho and Lallana is a good rotation that doesn't need to be diluted more with a big money acquisition.

In the absence of Suso it seems perfect for Luis Alberto or Teixeira to step up and be the one to fill in when necessary. Alberto seems to be the better player who can add more goals to the side but Teixeira seems more like he's suited to being further down the pecking order but working hard while he's there. I think I'd rather we sell Teixeira for profit (reckon we could get £1.5m to £2m for him) than sell Alberto at around a 50% loss.

This idea is out the window though if we pick up Konoplyanka on a free. He's a better player than both (understandable, he's 3 years older) and fits our high energy, high pressing, counter-attacking style.

Also does this account for investment though Crown dependencies which is where a lot of these property transactions come from and also the fact the City of London is a tax haven in its own right?

Savills have no idea where this money is coming from because, by its very nature, it's shrouded in secrecy. It may appear to be domestic, but is it? 

I mean if I look around my own area ( West London ) there are luxury developments springing up everywhere, there's nothing for the normal working man ( unless they can afford to rent such properties )  and that's all adding to the inequality gap here. 

Edit: I will add that it's not just the buying of properties where this investment goes, it's the development of properties both commercial and domestic too.

The truth of a defamatory statement is a *defence* to defamation, which means the ex-boyfriend has to show that it's true on the balance of probabilities or she wins. This is why English libel law is considered so generous towards the defamed party--in the USA, for example, the situation is reversed and the defamed party has to show that the statement is untrue.

All that said, she's unlikely to win the case, because the court will probably not find it to be a defamatory statement. The essence of defamation is that it lowers you in the opinion of *right-thinking* people. A right-thinking person, in the opinion of the court, would consider not being a prostitute a good thing, and therefore the statement is not defamatory. 

Precedent is against her claim on the matter. In Byrne v Deane, for example, the defendant had stated that the claimant was a police informant. This being public knowledge was clearly damaging to the claimant, as many people dislike police police informants, but in the eyes of the court no right-thinking person would consider aiding the police a bad thing.

I feel you are pointing out technicalities and ignoring the spirit of the policy, which is implicitly to leave the EU which is the point of UKIP. You have to understand UKIP is not a party like Labour or Conservatives, it's not their goal to get into power and run things, it's their goal to get into power or have enough influence to get us out of the EU and if they succeed they will likely disband or morph into a different party. 

So what UKIP policy is on the NHS or armed forces or even on immigration doesn't really matter that much so long as it sounds somewhat sane.

Like I said they are not a normal party, their supporters don't really vote for them based on the details of these policies, the only reason they really have them at all is that political parties are expected to have them and interviewers like to trip politicians up based on policy stuff.

Could you not bunk down for six months and increase the payments or liquidate an asset or several to pay it off? Ideally you'd want to have minimal commitments when moving into a new home as there are often considerable unforeseen expenses or you end up spending a shit load more than you might have thought!

I don't think it would make much different from your current lenders perspective. If anything I'd view it as a negative since it's not structured and there'd be no history on it.

Broken again. Same errer. Something fishy's going on in their internal network infrastructure.

Edit 4: 

Kind of reminds me of what happened at my previous position working at a European national broadcaster.. one of their switches failed and the failover wasn't configured properly, so it started looping the packets, causing it to fail rapidly as well, reboot, work for a few seconds and then die. Took the better part of a day to locate the fault before they got it. I was hanging around the networking dept, watching them become increasingly irate. Good times.

null,false,rtuck99,null,null,null,"&gt; The point is that allowing the money supply to constantly increase as happens currently massively distorts the economy and creates far worse outcomes than an alternative system would.

The money supply needs to increase because the amount of goods and services consumed by everybody is increasing, as is the population. If it didn't increase, we would have deflation. As it is we struggle to reach the 2% inflation target anyway. The current banking crisis and recession actually resulted in a massive decrease in the money supply, which the government had to correct by quantitative easing. The reduction in availability of loans actually made things worse by preventing businesses from investing money and expanding, as well as a reduction in consumer spending power, which accounts for a large proportion of GDP in a developed service oriented economy.

&gt; That money doesn't exist. It is just numbers on a piece of paper, figures on a database.

All money is meaningless and has no intrinsic value. Yet if it doesn't really exist, exactly how pleased would you be if your parent's pension (and your own) was reduced by 50%? Not very I expect.

&gt; So what do you think people where doing before private banks where given a free reign to do this?

He didn't even lose to a top 4 year team last year in PL, and lost imo the best Atletico side in decades. Which managed to steal a La Liga title from Barca and Real (could have won more too). 


This year, though wobbly, he is still standing strong. We haven't lost to Liverpool, Arsenal, United or City. We bested Tottenham in a 3 game ""series"" (one including a league cup final). Then in UCL, we did pretty well group stage, and obviously shit ourselves against PSG.

I don't see that as losing against big teams imo, we he have only lost like 3 times against them in 2 years. 

People shouldn't use the PSG game as a representation of his big games prowess. 


&gt;""I told you Diego would be a liability""

Jose knew his aggressiveness from the get go. It's supposed to get the other team frustrated into making mistakes. Like the Everton or Tottenham games this year.  It can be a liability, but Jose has already accepted that, and  opted to take the chance. He hasn't really cost us big time either. Only been banned for iirc think like 3-4 games.

null,false,Rock_Zeppelin,dalek,Dalek,null,"I had the same problem. Clara is definitely not among the Doctor's best companions. Amy, Rory and River though, definitely. I loved them all. I loved Amy's 'fuck you all I'm Scottish' attitude, I loved Rory being the most level-headed out of everyone while rising to the challenge when he had to, I loved River's mystery and sass and femme fatale charisma. Clara also had a bit of mystery around her, but with that gone, she's just... a bit of a judgemental control freak and a bitch. And yeah, she is shallow. And her and the Doctor are more or less the odd couple. And I agree, the romance between her and Danny was cheap, to say the least. 

I know this is just me repeating your words, but I can't help but agree with what you said. And yeah, the previous love stories were awesome. You had Rose and 9/10 which, at the end of season 4 left you bitterly happy. You had Martha's crush on the Doctor, which made you feel sorry for her but later happy that she got together with Micky, another failed love story between Rose and him which worked out for the better between both of those.

One thing I'd like to add though, is that, in the original series you had companions who were companions for different reasons. If you're familiar with them, there's Ian and Barbara, who only became the Doctor's companions out of sheer misfortune, but later grew enamoured my the adventure and knowledge they gained from him. Not to mention that the Doctor initially didn't like or want them, yet later grew fond of them. And while later they returned home of their own will out of desire for a normal life, I think they ended up together. All in all, a lovely story. Later on you had characters like Romana, who was a Time Lord like him, assigned to the Doctor by Gallifrey to study him and, I think keep him in line. For the record, I'd love seeing the Doctor travelling with another Time Lord again. And then there's Sarah Jane, who shared much of her story with Rose.

null,false,BitBargain,null,null,null,"Hi fmerz,

Most people who use BitBargain have not supplied ID and can purchase limited amounts as you did before.

I'm guessing you either created a new account, used a proxy/VPN or something similar which lead to your account(s) being requested to verify (the system does this automatically).

If you shoot an email to info@bitbargain.com from the email address on file for your account (also mentioning the username) I will be able to tell you why verification is needed for your account. If it's something trivial like you changed your name (added a third name for example), I'll be happy to remove the verification requirement.

For the record, we have 6,000 verified users currently. You'll end up being asked for ID on Localbitcoins as well, but as mentioned by someone else before, it's a much worse idea to send your ID to individual sellers rather than something like BitBargain where sellers simply see the verified status and not your documents.

The point of reunification wouldn't be to get handouts from the south now the British have had enough, it would be to develop a functioning economy so that we wouldn't need them. 

Britain's economic policy works fine for them, so there's no chance of it being changed to suit us. Not unless we accept massive cuts to our budget in exchange for the devolution of each tax, and so increase the deficit even more.

Fiscal reform isn't a valid solution to our problems either, we'll still need the subsidies to offer decent public services, we just won't have them. As a result our budget will be cut, our public services will suffer, the poor will get poorer, and our economy will continue to decline.

More importantly, fiscal reform isn't *intended* to solve our economic problems, it's intended to solve England's problem of having to subsidise us.

null,false,unnatural_rights,num23,,null,"It's very exciting in its own way, and very differently paced.  Women's sports in every way are under-attended, mostly I think because of certain ingrained societal biases about what's appropriate for ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" environments; sports often involve aggressive contact, antagonism, force, etc, which go against expected gender norms for women, so folks are less inclined to be interested.  The one exception may be the gymnastic summer and winter Olympic sports like rhythmic, bars, ice skating, etc, because those play into stereotypically feminine aspects like ""grace"" or ""beauty"".

In addition, I find it's more difficult for me to get invested in women's soccer on a team level, because of lack of knowledge about players and because of difficulty of access (small stadiums, inconveniently located).  The national team (US) is better because those women are successful, and Americans love to watch and celebrate a success.  So following individual players is (I think) more common; I'm a huge fan of [Megan Rapinoe](http://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2014/7/31/5954383/megan-rapinoe-scores-from-ridiculous-angle), for example, but I know next to nothing about the Seattle Reign, the league team she plays for, or about the Washington Spirit, the league team that plays in DC, where I live.

Ultimately, I think it's just going to take time.  As people become less invested in any sort of presupposed expectation of what soccer (e.g.) *should* be about, and how men/women *should* behave, women's soccer will normalize.  It's already got foundations as a popular way for girls to play roughly on par with boys - at a young age, physical differences are essentially irrelevant to quality of play - and as a now-decades-old popular sport for girls in its own right, at least in America.

I have private medical cover but wouldn't use it. Anytime i've tried there's always an insane excess fee. My friend had a similar issue to me and required a fairly minor surgery for it which he got on NHS. I tried the NHS and was told they don't do it any more. I tried my private cover and they said it'd cost upwards of £4k plus i'd need to go to scotland, my insurance would cover the first £150 of consultation fees....

Having said that, i'm sat with a gash on my baby toe and i'd really like to be able to just walk somewhere and quickly show it to a nurse/ doctor and be told on the spot whether it's needing treating or not and if needs be, arrange a time for treatment.  If I go to A&amp;E i just know i'll be sat there for at least 4hrs for them to pull me into a room n go 'That'll probably be fine on it's on'
If i thought there was somewhere handy that i could get a quick check done right now, i'd be very tempted to pay out a lil for the convenience.

Guys were applying for jobs, and they had no idea why the other blokes were getting on the site and they weren't. This is men with families to feed - it must have been devastating.

This is all very well documented - McAlpine started a blacklisting company after the previous firm became subject to an parliamentary enquiry in the 80's, and all this came out when it was raided by the information commissioners.

Road choice is weather dependent for me. Try avoiding roads that are covered by trees when it's been raining.. wet leaves are slippy as fuck. Manhole covers and gravel on roads can be equally bad too. Other than that, you know the roads in your area better than I do, so you can make an educated decision.

If you get into any dodgey situations, remember to look where you WANT to go, not at the obstacle you want to avoid (it's so easy to target fixate when you panic)

And lastly, take care of your bike regularly, safety comes first and it will save you money in the long run. Depending on the amount of riding you do, I recommend oilling the chain every 1-2 weeks.

It's Northern Ireland's fault for having the Troubles...

&gt;Britain's economic policy works fine for them, so there's no chance of it being changed to suit us.

Care to elaborate? Are you referring to monetary policy here?

&gt;The point of reunification wouldn't be to get handouts from the south now the British have had enough, it would be to develop a functioning economy so that we wouldn't need them.

How on earth will reunification lead to this? This is all idealist nationalist hogwash, sadly.

 I'd like to see us reunited but this daftness means I can't support it currently.

&gt;Fiscal reform isn't a valid solution to our problems either, we'll still need the subsidies to offer decent public services, we just won't have them. As a result our budget will be cut, our public services will suffer, the poor will get poorer, and our economy will continue to decline.

Exactly, which is why you need to do it gradually, in the most economically effective way possible. Tax rises, public sector cuts etc.

&gt;it's intended to solve England's problem of having to subsidise us.

The subsidy is inflated. I agree with fiscal transfers - I think richer countries like Ireland should transfer funds to poorer places like Lithuania or Greece within the EU for example, and this is even more important inside member states (eg in Spain, the UK, and Germany etc). 

 However they have to be reasonable. NI gets too high a subsidy and it needs to have it cut so it's forced to adjust. ",null,0,null,1426347855,null,0,false,0,cpepkn2,null,t3_2z03mp,null,t1_cpepkn2,null,t1_cpeovdi,null,null,null,1427758378,null,-6,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,-6,null

Err...

Iraq - 

* Under Hussein, a functioning society (albeit under dictatorship).

* After the *heroic* allied invasion, a hellhole crawling with ISIS and/or Al-Qaeda, public representatives killed all the time, car bombs pretty much everyday... up to 135,000 civilians murdered since allied invasion.

Libya - 

* Functioning society under Gadaffi (Albeit dictatorship). Significantly helped African countries with infrastructure development and was a somewhat socialist country. Almost classless society, free university etc etc, massive improvement in life.

* Post allied invasion, hellhole crawling with ISIS and Al-Qaeda, weak government, country still at war.

Syria -

* Functioning society, almost secular, multi-cultural etc (massive achievement in the middle east) economic heavyweight in the middle east, a leader in the region. (Albeit under dictatorship).

* Post allied invasion (well, arming every group from Syria to Timbuktu hell-bent on regime change) - hell-hole crawling with ISIS, Al-Nusra Front, Al-Qaeda, and hundreds more jihadist groups directly armed through allied arms caches. *Despite* a significant portion of the population supporting the government (hence its dragged on so long). Now reduced to a crumbling mess and divided between armed factions warring for strategic territory. Hundreds of thousands of innocents murdered.

Iran -

* Functioning, democratic society, military and economic heavyweight in the middle east.

* US and UK piling on the pressure and word wars with Iran. Invasion will take place eventually (especially if any Republican cockhead gets to power in the US), mark my words. Guess the outcome??

It is a very easy argument to make, that the Iraq, Afghanistan, Libyan, Syrian wars waged by the heroic allies have made conditions far worse for those in the middle east.

* Always check your brake light/rear light before riding - carry one of the emergency push bike rear lights with you in case if riding at night.
* Think to yourself that every driver hasn't seen you.
* Don't break in a corner. You will either low side due to locking up the rear, or due to braking causing the bike to stand up; run wide - this can kill on a left hander.

&gt;The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter will not receive the software package required to operate the Pentagon’s top close-air support bomb until 2022, according to military.com.

&gt;The article also stated that the JSF office already had discovered earlier that the precision-guided air-dropped Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) does not fit onto Joint Strike Fighter Marine Corps variant without modifications to the aircraft’s weapons bay.

&gt;Yet the Department of Defense will wait until the F-35 B (the Marine Corps variant of the F-35) reaches initial operability before modifying the F-35’s armament bay, since the weapon will be useless without the right software package.

The problem being it can't do it. Not until the software upgrades and the block 4 upgrades happen. So what can be done with it? Not fucking much is what.

Also, there is no precedent unless you are comparing being a police officer to being a prostitute? They are both professions, the similarity ends there. A right-thinking person would think it is defamatory to claim someone lied about their profession if it is untrue.

Nigel here is demonstrating a complete lack of understanding of anything medical while painting a story and frankly being a dick towards doctors. IF we need to finish early to get a round of golf in, then Mr. Farage's apartment clearly has a mirrored table and a suspicious amount of razor blades. 

Firstly? This is in 1986. There are doctors alive TODAY who were not back then. I was born in 1985. My parents were one of those doctors he disparages. Asian doctors. But let's have a little look into the treatment of testicular swellings. 

The majority of testicular swelling is not cancer. 

The most common cause are hernias followed by hydrocele (fluid). You then have Torsion Testes. Now the first two conditions can be diagnosed easily. Hernia respond to  coughing and hydrocele allow light to shine through. 

A torsion is a serious issue. Rapid response can save the testis in question. And look, the story shows the NHS responded to his A&amp;E complaint by ruling out the most common causes and opting for the most serious one. 

THe next most common are the testicular infections. Orchiditis, Epididymitis and Mumps. LAST and finally are Cancer and Congestive Cardiac Failure.

Now here is the thing? Nigel Farage doesn't mention whether he gave blood or not. The traditional test for Testicular cancer is an ultrasound. It's still the gold standard test for it. Now the ultrasound only detects cancer in around 90% of people. The rest you have to use your brain. You can test negative and still have cancer. Sucks but a little bit of logic is what doctors are paid for.

The doctors here were using their brain. Nigel doesn't understand the logic but here is the thing. 

You show up to the A&amp;E and not the GP they are going to treat you differently. A&amp;E sees EMERGENCIES. So they are going to ask the following history. Fever and Injury. I know of a young lad who lost a testis after sliding down a bannister and another who sat down on his bicycle seat a bit too hard. Happens. Then you have to worry about torsion testes. The ""ball"" as it were twists around inside the scrotum tangling up the arteries and veins and strangling itself. It can be saved if treated quickly. Note the NHS ran with this as the most likely cause because it is more common and something that can be saved.

Further testing ruled it out. Note, I am going to assume he had an ultrasound which is why his ""Indian"" doctor ruled for infection. The more common cause. And one that's manageable via medication rather than orchidectomy (AKA Ball Removal).

Now here is the thing? If the swelling didn't drop, it would be an indicator for exploratory surgery and orchidectomy. 

What his ""private"" surgeon did was go ""well everything else has been ruled out, only one option left. Nigel thinks this is an astonishing piece of medicine but guess what? 

I am a newbie doctor. I assist in these procedures. It is not brain surgery. This is bread and butter general surgery. 

What irks me is how his private doctor allegedly behaved. See? He's trashing people who did the right thing. If your private doctor's FIRST step is to go ""CUT IT OFF"" then you got to worry about this. 

Nigel bitches about how different doctors palpated him but forgets that EVERY doctor does this. Hell? I palpate EVERY patient every day on my ward rounds because it is good medical practice so you don't miss things. Even patients who I have seen daily. It's not a case of trust, it's a case of due diligence. 

What's particularly galling is how his private doctor stated that he MUST have metastasis. Without a Chest X-Ray? Without a Tec Bone Scan? Can't be MRI, the first one was invented in the 1980s and they wouldn't have been common place enough at the period. The fact he had a radiographer tell him things indicates he either had a X-ray or a CT scan, neither of which are indicative of anything. 

Maybe he was an ultrasound technician but in general such diagnosis are in the hands of RADIOLOGISTS who are ""doctors"". Not the paramedical technicians. It's highly unethical to make such a diagnosis when you aren't qualified to do so. I would not make the diagnosis, I would say ""Let us refer it to an expert"". 

The only foolproof way of confirming a testicular carcinoma is by dissection. You cannot biopsy the tissue as testicular cancer (while painful) is a generally localised cancer and a biopsy will spread the tumour making it worse. You generally do the procedure and tell the patient later that it was a cancerous tumour. 

The story is dishonest. And NHS care with regards to this has improved. Ultrasound has become more common place as prices have fallen. MRI is more common place too. 

The NHS didn't almost kill Nigel Farage. A lot of this is his own fault. He went to A&amp;E, sorry guys. Cancer is not an emergency. It's a life threatening non-emergency condition. He should have started with a GP. 

We moan about time wasters on the NHS using the wrong service for the wrong purpose. In retrospect? If Nigel is allowed to bitch about the NHS when retrospectively they dallied about (put it this way? If it wasn't Cancer and more often than not it isn't cancer. Nigel would have been bitching about how the NHS stole his testicle) then I am allowed to point out that Nigel retrospectively was one of those time waster patients who keep wasting A&amp;E resources.

Nonsense. The subsidies started before the Troubles and doubled after the GFA. Globalisation did our economy in and poor governance means we didn't compensate by developing a modern economy.

&gt;Care to elaborate? Are you referring to monetary policy here?

I'm referring to all government economic policy. Tax rates, infrastructure spending, welfare rates, where they focus their efforts to attract investment, everything.

&gt;How on earth will reunification lead to this? This is all idealist nationalist hogwash, sadly.

Because the government of a United Ireland would be able to, and would need to, focus all its efforts on developing our economy. The UK can safely ignore our economic problems since we make up a tiny proportion of its population and an even tinier proportion of its economy.

Nationalists are well aware that reunification isn't a magic tool that'll develop us into paradise overnight. We're aware that the south didn't magically become one of the wealthiest countries in the world overnight when it became independent either. 

What independence meant for the south, and reunification means for the north, is that we have direct control of the tools necessary to begin the process.

&gt;Exactly, which is why you need to do it gradually, in the most economically effective way possible. Tax rises, public sector cuts etc.

Well, it's not being done gradually or in the most economically effective way possible. It's being done because the Tories want to ram through their ideologically-driven welfare cuts.

It's also being done at entirely the wrong time.

null,false,Taure,null,null,null,"&gt;But a right thinking person would think that being call a liar when it is untrue is defamatory.

This cannot work as an argument. Almost every case of purported defamation involves calling someone a liar, because you have two people contradicting each other. If calling someone a liar was enough to count as defamation, then all contradicting statements would be automatically defamation. This is clearly not the case, as evidenced by the fact that we have a test for what constitutes defamation.

S.1(1) of the Defamation Act 2013 lays out one part of the test:

""A statement is not defamatory unless its publication has caused or is likely to cause serious harm to the reputation of the claimant.""

But this is just one part. The rest comes from common law, and as stated above, courts have interpreted ""harm to the reputation"" as harm in the minds of right thinking people.

In this case, the claimant is being called a liar *with respect to her claims about being a prostitute*. It's that substantive claim regarding prostitution which will be the focus of the case.

The claimant's only real hope of success is appealing the case all the way to the Supreme Court where the interpretation of ""harm to reputation"" can be revised.

&gt;Also, there is no precedent unless you are comparing being a police officer to being a prostitute? They are both professions, the similarity ends there.

Precedent isn't about facts, it's about legal principle. The part of a judgment which is binding precedent is called the *ratio decidendi*, which roughly translates as ""reason for deciding"". That is to say, what is binding is not the decision on those facts, but the legal principle behind the decision. In the case of Byrne v Deane, the principle is that you can't defame a person with a claim about them which would not lower them in the esteem of right-thinking people. This principle applies across facts, so it doesn't matter that in one case the claimant was a police informant and the other a prostitute.",null,0,null,1426352893,null,0,false,0,cperxz1,null,t3_2z0g50,null,t1_cperxz1,null,t1_cperl3q,null,null,null,1427759563,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

BUT HOW FUCKING DARE KEVIN NOLAN BE PLAYED FOR 90 MINUTES TODAY? He had an injury in the 15th! He was fucked by the 30th! We don't make any subs until the 75th and when we do we take Jarvis off who's been more industrial. And then when we go 2 down we take Noble off who's much fitter than Nolan. 

Now look, I'm not even criticizing Nolan at this point, this is a Sam criticism. Nolan did ok for a clearly gassed player today. But Sam has been absolutely terrible with substitutions recently and its really getting on my tits. I'm not a vocal Sam critic. I think criticising him largely ignores our spot on the table and employs a ""yeah but what has he done for me lately"" attitude. But for real serious, his substitutions recently have been AWFUL. Reminds me A LOT of our time under Zola. Zola had a very good plan A but as soon as that fell apart he was simply unable to make substitutions or changes. Sam seems to be going down that road and it is worrying me A LOT.


Obviously the injuries are a big problem, but you know how you avoid injuries? Rotation and substitution. You know how you get a goal back at 1-0 down? Impact sub, changing formation. Bringing Morgan on for Jarvis is a fucking like for like swap and if its not been working for 75 its not gonna work for the last 15.


Those last 2 goals happened solely because of fatigue and a loss of concentration that could have been avoided with earlier subs and smarter subs.



THAT BEING SAID: we were always going to lose this game so it would be best to just move on as soon as possible to the next game, but fmd if Sam doesn't need to radically change his substitution policy.

I know you kind of tried to move on after this, but surely we both agree it meets this criteria? A large part of her reputation is based on her blog and novels, which are all based on the claim she was a prostitute and therefore her works are true. Someone with a close relationship claiming she has lied definitely falls under ""likely to cause serious harm"" to her reputation. She will go from a respected author, to a fraud. It does not matter what the claim was.

&gt;In this case, the claimant is being called a liar with respect to her claims about being a prostitute. It's that substantive claim regarding prostitution which will be the focus of the case.

I really doubt it will be, that is the media hook for people to read the story as I actually generally agree, the prostitute angle will likely not win the case. The focus of the case will be that calling her a liar about her previous career will have a direct impact on her current career, income and reputation - if it is untrue.

The crux of this case is that her current reputation is built entirely on the truth of her previous claim, not the nature of the claim. ",null,0,null,1426353578,null,0,false,0,cpesa9t,null,t3_2z0g50,null,t1_cpesa9t,null,t1_cperxz1,null,null,null,1427759723,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

What was particularly frustrating today though was the pairing of Martin and Bassong. I'm not criticising their selection or anything like that, as they've both been largely excellent lately, but it feels like a lot of our troubles stemmed from those two today. In particular, Martin was nothing short of shocking at times. Putting aside the fact that he undoubtedly deserved to be sent off, both he and Bassong were caught out time and again on the ball in defence. It was like every second ball that came their way, they'd decide to dwell on it far too long before hurriedly passing it back to Ruddy or scrambling it away. I understand the merits of having ball-playing defenders, especially in a high-tempo system such as ours, but it did much more harm than good. Their shakiness on the ball affected us elsewhere on the pitch and led to an inability to dictate the play for any extended period of time.

null,false,rtuck99,null,null,null,"Damp in houses is a complex problem which may have many causes.

In general you've either got damp caused by water from outside getting in, or damp caused by water from inside not getting out.

Things to consider:

* What temperature is the room normally at - if it's cold a lot of the time, the walls will be colder than the air and moisture will collect on them - solution - turn the heating on
* How many people are in the room and for how long - if too many during the night then you may get condensation especially if the heat is off on cold nights - solution more ventilation or fewer people.
* Are you cooking / or drying clothes in the room - all that water goes into the air. If you dry clothes in the room imagine wringing them all out on the walls - the moisure's got to go somewhere. Solution - dry them somewhere else.
* Is it near a bathroom where damp air can come in?
* Is it coming from outside, is the roof in good repair?
* What is the construction of the house, is it well insulated? Sometimes insulating the house and stopping draughts actually makes condensation problems worse because it increases humidity. Sometimes cavity wall insulation gets put in but air bricks get blocked and/or thermal bridges between the exterior and interior walls get made.
* Is your room on the ground floor? Is the damp-proof course in good condition?
* Are the gutters clear and working?
* Is there a blocked drain or gulley nearby?

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"It strikes me this idea is classically very Vince Cable-esque, in that it superficially sounds good on paper... but is unlikely to do well in reality, either in popularity or by alleviating the housing crisis.

The trouble is, tenants would have to rent for such significant periods of time before ""owning"" the home. Its testament to what the Lib Dems think owning is... paper ownership of a property deed. However, in reality to ordinary folks ownership is stability, financial security and the ability to rebuild, adapt or adjust the property - not simply bragging rights or a retirement investment. Under this scheme some poor tenant would have to be indentured to the schemes owners for 30 years before actually taking physical ownership. What would happen if (as they almost certainly would) they were to upgrade or their needs were to change in that time span... I don't know, perhaps due to something like the birth of children - the subsequent birth of more children and then finally by the departure of those children or the breakdown of the relationship that the house was structured around. The complexities involved make it impractical. 

These products won't be competitive with a traditional mortgage. The issue isn't that people can't own homes or don't have the funds to finance a mortgage. Virtually anyone renting privately outside of social housing has the funds they would need to finance a mortgage.... The issue is that unless you have £20,000 sat in the bank you can't get a mortgage to start with. The problem is the banks find it safer to lend money (in the form of a mortgage) to a 55 year old BTL landlord because he can front the £15,000 deposit... even though he only has 10 years left to work, whilst a 25 year old young professional with 40 years of working life left in them is technically a ""risky option"", because they don't have £15,000 in cash to hand now (despite the fact they'd have paid that off the mortgage within the first 3 years).

The solution is to build more homes, to drive down the cost of property so the numbers involved aren't as ludicrous. Then the banks will not be so risk-averse in lending to younger people who want to buy and we are likely to see a return to 100% mortgages - but with greater scrutiny of a prospective buyers ability to pay back. It is after all in the banks interest to have young people engages with their financial products from a young age.

The Old Firm games should not be 3pm kick offs.  I believe that Police Scotland are against the idea for public safety reasons.

The archive thing is spot on (he's right to reference the WWE network with that).

My additions?

Speak to the SFA about at least highlights of Scotland and Scottish Cup games as well as adding classic games to the archive.  Speak to UEFA, not just for highlights of Scottish teams in Europa/Champions League, but also the rights to add classic games for the archive (I can think of three straight away).  Ditto FIFA with classic Scotland World Cup matches (Holland in Argentina, for example).

I'd also add a juniors round up show.  I'm not necessarily saying have cameras at every game, just a half hour/hour every week on them.

It's not really looking down on anybody to say that their time isn't worth £6.50 an hour. If they're unemployed, haven't worked in a while etc, their time definitely isn't worth the same as a cleaner (who you let into your house), or a care worker, or even a waitress (who need to have training, be professional/personable, remember many things etc) who also receive £6.50/hr. 

Literally, a child could pick up stuff off the ground and put it into a bag. It's the least stressful job ever, and you don't need to interact with anybody at all. And from the council point of view, they want cleaner streets of course, but there aren't an abundance of litter picking jobs because the bang-for-buck isn't good enough, compared to all the other jobs that could be done with the same money. I doubt the guys driving around the in lorry get paid much more than that, but that needs some skill and training at least. 

Thus, I have no problem with unemployed people working a reasonable number of hours a week to keep the streets tidier.

null,false,miomike,null,null,null,"If anything, this is what I expected us to be like at the start of the season. A lot of our players look like they've never played together, or not got what it takes in the PL. The problem is obviously they look like this after a start that looked like we could smash every team coming.  

I put this down to, as /u/mr-dogshit has said, teams figuring us out. I think no-one expected us to be quite so cohesive when we started the season, and teams came to try to take advantage of what they thought would be a disjointed team. Instead we had a way of playing that worked wonders, and looked fluid in attack and solid in defence. However, while we've mostly retained our solidity in defence, our attack was very one-track. Teams figured out that what we did was get it to Pelle who would hold up, bring it down and lay it off to a runner. They also figured our full backs were our main width, as our wingers would have to sit narrower to be close enough to benefit from Pelle's flick ons. Relatively speaking, this is quite a simple thing to defend. Stick your quickest players (wingers) up high so our FB's can't go forward, get your biggest defender (or two biggest) to mark Pelle, contend for every high ball and put pressure on him, and let the other defenders just stop the wingers from doing much.  

This is what I think has happened, and it means we've been getting frustrated in attack, because what was our one way of playing (because we didn't have a lot of time to build lots of alternate tactics) has started to fail us, but we're still basically a new team, and can't easily switch to a new formation that works well, without the risks that come with it - like against West Brom.  

Hopefully Koeman will find something, we looked OK with 3-5-2 originally around Christmas, but not so much against West Brom. Our key players early on have dropped off a bit, been figured out or just not been up to scratch (Tadic, sorry pal), but we're still in a better position than I could have hoped, and if we're lucky we could get Europe from finishing 7th, which would be an amazing outcome in every way, other than when comparing it to the hope of post-January.",null,0,null,1426355379,null,0,false,0,cpet6mg,null,t3_2z0hup,null,t1_cpet6mg,null,t3_2z0hup,null,null,null,1427760143,null,3,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,3,null

It doesn't have the international reputation, as you suggest, of some of its larger fellow colleges in the UofLondon - but don't think that makes it subpar. If you are looking for student experience, QM beats anyone else in the UofLondon (including UCL) and in the academic world is incredibly well thought of (internationally).

For Economics, really spending time scoping out the curricula of the different choices will be important. As I am sure you know, how undergraduates are taught economics in the UK is under some big changes at the moment and you want to make sure you are on the right side of them. For History, Birmingham and QM are the best of your options.

Since the people running the scheme would have to buy back any shares, presumably they aren't going to chuck you out on a whim. And I imagine they'd be a bit more flexible on alterations to the property than a standard tenancy, especially if you have significant equity.

Saving 15k is not difficult for a single person on a graduate salary if they live frugally over several years. I know because I've saved that amount several times over. Part of the problem is that people expect to be able to magically buy their own home on much less income and without making any effort to control their expenses.

100% mortgages and the high availability of credit is what drives house prices in this country. Supply is constrained and therefore prices are set by the size of the obtainable mortgage. If you want to see cheaper houses you've either got to build, renovate or vacate several hundred thousand empty properties a year for the next decade (fat chance of that happening in the south east where everybody seems to want to live), or you can go back to restricting everyone to 60% LTV, which I guarantee will fix the problem everywhere outside of London (where prices are not constrained by mortgage finance).

I've always believed xenophobia can be targeted though that may be wrong and I believe racism is purely biological. Indeed quoted from the wikipedia page you linked:

&gt;Racism consists of both prejudice and discrimination based in social perceptions of biological differences between peoples.

It also goes on to say:

&gt;While race and ethnicity are considered to be separate phenomena in contemporary social science, the two terms have a long history of equivalence in popular usage and older social science literature

Which somewhat muddies the water. I do however believe there needs to be a distinction between race and ethnicity. Hating black people because you believe they are genetically inferior and hating the Irish because you believe they have a culture of being lazy are two different things.

I said it a couple of days ago. 3-0 to Arsenal. We were never going to get a result in this match. A depleted side with the injuries occurring at the key positions. A drastic loss of form. No bench, and absolutely no depth. Our new wonder signings no longer a surprise to the rest of the league. A side that's got their holiday bags packed and waiting by the door, versus a side bang in form with everything to play for. Arsenal were probably the last side we needed to see today.
Anyhow, we've got a few matches coming up where we should be in with a shout to get a result. It's time for West Ham to unpack their bags and play for their spots in the side next season. It's mettle time.
One thing I hope we address in the offseason is the matter of our fitness. We are clearly not in the physical condition required of this league.

However, an employee punching a boss knows he's going to face the sack for it, because the boss is the one with the power to hire or fire.

Even if there were no witnesses, the boss's word would be accepted over that of the employee.

Thus it's not the same when a boss punches an employee - the employee risks losing his job if he reports it, if management stands behind their buddy.

In fact, it seems like Tymon has already engaged these employment lawyers, Slater and Gordon, which seems quite wise.

null,false,HufflepuffBadger,null,null,null,"&gt;How does the school system work (what age does it start, etc.)

Start Primary at 4/5 and attend for 7 years. The years are called P1-P7 by most. Then you go on to secondary school, most of which run from Form 1-Form 5, then you sit your GCSE's and if you do well enough can go back for Lower and Upper Sixth and sit AS and A-Levels. If you wish in your final year of Primary school you can choose to sit exams to go to a Grammer School which is usually considered to be better than other Secondary Schools.

The school system isn't formally segregated between Catholics and Protestants but most schools aren't formally integrated either. So you end up having schools that are labelled 'Protestant' or 'Catholic' despite them not taking an outward stand on it. I went to a 'Protestant' school that made it abundantly clear that they consider themselves integrated even if the government doesn't officially.

Then there are formal Catholic/Protestant schools that you don't *technically* have to be Catholic/Protestant to go to but you do have to agree to follow the teachings of the church whilst there and go to mass etc. These tend to do very well in exam results.

&gt;Working conditions

No idea sorry, still at Uni.

&gt; Popular activities among teenagers and young adults.

Go up the Cave Hill and sit and chat calmly and don't drink alcohol, not even a little bit /s. Sit about City Hall if you're a bit of a goth/emo. Just chill in Starbucks. Personally I go to the cinema a lot (Dublin Road Cinema preferably) and there's a great one called the Queens Film Theatre that is more...well tbh arty and douchy, you don't get popcorn but you can have  a box of crisps and a glass of wine or cup of tea. Same as you probably, just chill at your mates house and have a party when your parents are out. 

&gt;Is there still a conflict between Catholics and Protestants? How does it affect the society?

Not officially, google the Good Friday Agreement, it's massively calmed down but you do get a few dicks trying to start it up again. Society wise it's mostly annoying for people as you can get riots/protests cutting off the city centre for a few days. Parading, mostly by Unionists, causes drama every year (google that too). Our political parties are absolute shit. On the other hand the younger you are the less it affects you, in school we used to split football teams up at lunch based on whether you were Protestant or Catholic (also everyone is Protestant or Catholic even if your Muslim, it's more a shorthand for where you grew up a lot of the time).

&gt;Popular native foods and desserts.

Tayto Cheese and Onion crisps, Boojum (Burrito's), Ulster Fry.

null,false,onse,null,null,null,"In the UK, the content of an IGCSE specification is usually studied over two years. There is no rule that says it has to be two years, there are only 'Guided Learning Hours (GLH)' which for anything at this level will usually be 120 GLH. This is the amount of contact time a teacher or tutor should have with a learner and does not include homework or self-directed learning. This is not compulsory, though, and you could just turn up on the day and sit the exam with no proof of prior study needed.

Some places may offer online teaching of the content, however the bottom line is that you will almost always need to attend a centre (a school or other registered institution) in order to sit the actual exam paper. I can't speak for all awarding bodies but from my experience IGCSEs do not usually have a coursework element (i.e. not an exam, a piece of work which is completed over a period of time), and are usually 100% exams, but these need to be taken at a registered and approved centre at a set time and on a set date, usually either in January or May/June.

There are international centres where you can just turn up and take the exam (in this case you would be referred to as a 'private candidate') however you will need to check with the exam board (Cambridge in your case) if there are any near you. Your other option is to maybe get in touch with any International British schools near you as it is likely they will run some kind of IGCSEs.

You should try and contact the student team at the Cambridge exam board, they should be able to help you find a suitable arrangement.

That Juventus goal, that goal against Norwhich(with the outside of his boot, could be any team...I can't remember sorry) this season, his countless one touch heel-flick-ons, etc. He unites the classical Brazil-brilliance with a hard working ethiopian marathon runner.

I know, he's still not quite there where we want him to be and he has a bit of drop in form but I'm sure he'll bounce back. Sometimes I think he could become our best player when he's 26 or 27 years because I feel like he's improved a lot more than Eden since he came here and I think he still can improve a lot more. His touch and passing is still not perfect at times but it's way better than in his first season and I think he has exceptional numbers this year for a player who's job is first and foremost pressing because despite playing as a 10 our creative outlets are Hazard and Cesc and our finisher is Costa with a bit of Hazard and Oscar.

6 goals, 7 assists. I'm too lazy to check the stats but I think that's top 10 in the league despite Costa, Hazard and Cesc all playing on the same team.

Also his understanding with Cesc and Hazard is unmatched in our team.

If something bad happens in the game and the players pressure the ref to respond to that and gain an advantage, it's kinda understandable.

To not do it because there are paid people there is a poor rationalisation for being a bit lazy.

With regards to restaurants, no, you don't wash up, but you've also paid more for that privilege... and equating washing up to throwing stuff in an easily accessible bin is utter tosh. A lot of people will pile their plates at restaurants to make it easier for staff even so (maybe not at extra posh places, but then there's a different culture around that).

To clear it up at minimal effort to yourself at the very worst will make the staff's day marginally easier. Its just a nice thing to do. Oh and that argument about not having to employ someone to tidy up which will put someone out of a job?

Nigel here is demonstrating a complete lack of understanding of anything medical while painting a story and frankly being a dick towards doctors. IF we need to finish early to get a round of golf in, then Mr. Farage's apartment clearly has a mirrored table and a suspicious amount of razor blades.

Firstly? This is in 1986. There are doctors alive TODAY who were not back then. I was born in 1985. My parents were one of those doctors he disparages. Asian doctors. But let's have a little look into the treatment of testicular swellings.

The majority of testicular swelling is not cancer.

The most common cause are hernias followed by hydrocele (fluid). You then have Torsion Testes. Now the first two conditions can be diagnosed easily. Hernia respond to coughing and hydrocele allow light to shine through.
A torsion is a serious issue. Rapid response can save the testis in question. And look, the story shows the NHS responded to his A&amp;E complaint by ruling out the most common causes and opting for the most serious one.

The next most common are the testicular infections. Orchiditis, Epididymitis and Mumps. LAST and finally are Cancer and Congestive Cardiac Failure.

Now here is the thing? Nigel Farage doesn't mention whether he gave blood or not. The traditional test for Testicular cancer is an ultrasound. It's still the gold standard test for it. Now the ultrasound only detects cancer in around 90% of people. The rest you have to use your brain. You can test negative and still have cancer. Sucks but a little bit of logic is what doctors are paid for.

The doctors here were using their brain. Nigel doesn't understand the logic but here is the thing.
You show up to the A&amp;E and not the GP they are going to treat you differently. A&amp;E sees EMERGENCIES. So they are going to ask the following history. Fever and Injury. I know of a young lad who lost a testis after sliding down a bannister and another who sat down on his bicycle seat a bit too hard. Happens. Then you have to worry about torsion testes. The ""ball"" as it were twists around inside the scrotum tangling up the arteries and veins and strangling itself. It can be saved if treated quickly. Note the NHS ran with this as the most likely cause because it is more common and something that can be saved.

Further testing ruled it out. Note, I am going to assume he had an ultrasound which is why his ""Indian"" doctor ruled for infection. The more common cause. And one that's manageable via medication rather than orchidectomy (AKA Ball Removal).

Now here is the thing? If the swelling didn't drop, it would be an indicator for exploratory surgery and orchidectomy. AKA what he finally got...

What his ""private"" surgeon did was go ""well everything else has been ruled out, only one option left. Nigel thinks this is an astonishing piece of medicine but guess what?

I am a newbie doctor. I assist in these procedures. It is not brain surgery. This is bread and butter general surgery.
What irks me is how his private doctor allegedly behaved. See? He's trashing people who did the right thing. If your private doctor's FIRST step is to go ""CUT IT OFF"" then you got to worry about this.

Nigel bitches about how different doctors palpated him but forgets that EVERY doctor does this. Hell? I palpate EVERY patient every day on my ward rounds because it is good medical practice so you don't miss things. Even patients who I have seen daily. It's not a case of trust, it's a case of due diligence.

What's particularly galling is how his private doctor stated that he MUST have metastasis. Without a Chest X-Ray? Without a Tec Bone Scan? Can't be MRI, the first one was invented in the 1980s and they wouldn't have been common place enough at the period. The fact he had a radiographer tell him things indicates he either had a X-ray or a CT scan, neither of which are indicative of anything.

Maybe he was an ultrasound technician but in general such diagnosis are in the hands of RADIOLOGISTS who are ""doctors"". Not the paramedical technicians. It's highly unethical to make such a diagnosis when you aren't qualified to do so. I would not make the diagnosis, I would say ""Let us refer it to an expert"".

The only foolproof way of confirming a testicular carcinoma is by dissection. You cannot biopsy the tissue as testicular cancer (while painful) is a generally localised cancer and a biopsy will spread the tumour making it worse. You generally do the procedure and tell the patient later that it was a cancerous tumour.

The story is dishonest. And NHS care with regards to this has improved. Ultrasound has become more common place as prices have fallen. MRI is more common place too.

The NHS didn't almost kill Nigel Farage. A lot of this is his own fault. He went to A&amp;E, sorry guys. Cancer is not an emergency. It's a life threatening non-emergency condition. He should have started with a GP.

We moan about time wasters on the NHS using the wrong service for the wrong purpose. In retrospect? If Nigel is allowed to bitch about the NHS when retrospectively they dallied about (put it this way? If it wasn't Cancer and more often than not it isn't cancer. Nigel would have been bitching about how the NHS stole his testicle) then I am allowed to point out that Nigel retrospectively was one of those time waster patients who keep wasting A&amp;E resources.",null,0,null,1426359375,null,0,false,0,cpev7ay,null,t3_2z05ax,null,t1_cpev7ay,null,t3_2z05ax,null,null,null,1427761084,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

Essentially, it's beeping. Why? Nobody knows. Sometimes it has coded russian voice messages. Sometimes they can hear proper Russian sentences.

There are not many things known about this frequency.

1. The source of the noise / messages is Russia.
2. Very high confidence that it's coming from a secret Russian Military HQ.

Then you can jump to the question of why. Essentially, this frequency has this beeping noise since 82...

Best guess is that this is one of the highest priority channels in Russia. Let's say, beeping stops for over an hour, launch all nukes.

Public spending per capita is higher here than in any other constituent country/state etc of the UK. It's this way because we've been sheltered from both the natural savings that all govt departments should be making in times of economic uncertainty, and from the more severe austerity cuts.

We have different political problems, but also the same ones. The unionist parties want to be good little Britishers and apply the cuts, the shinners aren't daft and probably realise that cuts are needed (maybe not these cuts, and not as drastic) but can't possibly agree as it would undermine their all-island policies.

Devolution is part of our economic problem so we either accept that we are going to suffer a little more financially in order to have power sharing, or we hand all the important stuff over to Westminster and concentrate on solving the non-economic issues first.

Personally I'm in favour of handing back control, for now. There are serious decisions to be made here, not least with the NHS and I can't see any local politician being brave enough to make them.

null,false,Cast_Me-Aside,null,null,null,"&gt; With that said, as per what I said above the new schemes are really just variations on the EFRBS stuff which is now getting businesses APNs (Accelerated Payment Notices) **which is basically the HMRC saying ""oi you lot, that was technically legal but a bit dodge and now you have to pay tax without even going to court""** and I suspect that is also a future possibility.

With regard to the bold section in the above:  No.

Given that you also said in this thread that you're doing ATT qualifications you do, or should know better.

APNs apply to either schemes subject to DOTAS (Disclosure Of Tax Avoidance Schemes) or to avoidance schemes under enquiry where a follower notice has been given.  A follower notice is essentially a decision that the facts of your case match those in another **and** that the lead case has been tested at the Tribunal and it failed there **and** that it was a final appeal.

You can make representations against a follower notice on the grounds that either the facts of the decided case and yours do not match or that HMRC did not follow the correct procedures.  While there is no appeal process if HMRC refuses your representations, you **can** apply for a judicial review and current thinking is generally that HMRC will struggle here.  

Additionally, while non-compliance with an APN can result in a penalty of up to 50% of the disputed tax a recent *(non-UK)* ECHR case found that a 50% penalty was sufficiently high as to amount to a criminal penalty.  If the same principle holds up here then Article 6 of HRA kicks in and you get a right to a court hearing.

Going all the way back to the start though, there's no level on which HMRC have said anything relevant to an APN was legal.  The entire point is that the legal position is in dispute.  That is, HMRC have pretty much made it all too clear that they are **not** satisfied that your claims are ok.

As such, it's a bit more like HMRC saying, *""You guys have been putting in so many schemes that we're going to test them before rather than after we let you have the reliefs you claimed.""*",null,0,null,1426361064,null,0,false,0,cpew1ad,null,t3_2z080t,null,t1_cpew1ad,null,t1_cpentgp,null,null,null,1427761472,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

From my point of view the current world is completely upside down. Our priorities are badly bent. The people who should be making the most money and be the best well off is the people who provide things that are basic life necessities.

If you actually read further this try to think of it in a world without money but based on rewards of value added to peoples lives, society and general well being rather than financial status and how much money somebody has been able to extract from another.

This sort of thing starts with food (which last time i checked everyone needs to eat). Farmers should be well paid after all without them nobody would be able to eat. The same sort of thing then goes for nurses, doctors, surgeons and medical staff. This should be passed on to the people who then do the research for health care to keep us alive and well.

But when you look at the flip side of the coin. When you look at high paid bankers. Just what do they actually add to the value of the human race that is actually positive. They don't produce anything. They don't heal anyone. They don't provide anything. The only thing they do actually do is create dept which is used to enslave everyone and to keep them inline. They are in fact leeches.

A really good example of how the financial system leeches from everyone is how they buy something from the source then sell it to somebody else. They don't add any value to the item. They don't actually event see the item they have often bought or sold. But their job is to push it for the highest price they possibly can. Yet they often make the most profit from the item that is bought or sold.

So if you imagine a world where your status and ""richness"" / ""rewards"" came about by the things you added to society to improve the quality of life of others. Where do you think teachers, nurses, vets, care works etc.. and the rest of the staff are going to be compared to bankers, lawyers, accountants and business people.

If you look at some industries like the legal system. Its created and managed by lawyers for lawyers.

It was so clear at half time we needed a better link in the middle of the pitch, perfect situation for Nasri to come on at the expense of a striker but of course we stuck with a 4-4-2. Of course Dzeko went off for Bony, like for like, and when Dzeko was actually dropping deeper than Aguero. And I have no words for that Jovetic substitution. Just horribly devoid of ideas throughout the entire game.

But anyway, assuming the programmes at both are basically the same the day usually starts with something like the [Ginetta Junior](http://www.btccpages.com/gallery/d/8934-1/Ginetta+Junior+-+Jake+Hill+leads+lap+one+-+Credit+Jakob+Ebrey.jpg) race which consists of 14-17yos racing each other so they're often rather aggressive drivers as they're not as fine tuned as the older guys and also have those teenage hormones running through them. Great fun to watch.

Then there'll be the [Ginetta GT Supercup](http://www.ginetta.com/images/news/1364750365.jpg) which is very similar to the previous but older guys with better cars. There's 2 classes of Ginetta racing at the same time here so expect to see people getting lapped as one groups cars aren't as fast as the others.

Then the [Porsche Carrera Cup](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xgzCVMlc0DU/maxresdefault.jpg). This is a bit more like F1 in that there's no physical touching. The guys here have invested too much money to bash into each other. There always seems to be someone who's pathetic and well behind the rest of the pack - rich enough to buy a car but not good at driving it. Great seeing him get lapped.

Then comes the [BTCC](http://www.touringcartimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/btcc2014.jpg). This is the highlight. The fastest cars and with the most financial support these guys don't give a fuck about bashing into each other as they fly round the track. Things can be hanging off of the car and they'll still be driving hell for leather desperate to win. There's a reason Top Gear use these lads so often to do races with (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K05NgDMz2r4).

At Knockhill there's 3 BTCC races throughout the day and usually 2 of the other types. There's also various other types like the [Clio Cup](http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/images/localworld/ugc-images/276329/Article/images/21058552/6077575-large.jpg) or the [Legends](http://image.stockcarracing.com/f/techarticles/general/10405439/scrp_0810_06_z%2Bdialing_in_a_legends_car%2Bstability.jpg) occasionally as well.

I like God Complex because it's one if the only season 6 episodes with meaningful and logical character development. Most of season 6 is spent tearing down or stagnating on all the work season 5 did with with Amy and Rory as characters. The central issues and twist of the monster needing faith rather than fear works incredibly well because it draws on the fundamental issues behind Amy's actions as a character and finally gives some insight into why the return of her parents had so little effect on her life. In this episode we finally see her image of the Doctor crash into his own as he is forced to confront the effect that his outward bravado can have on those around him. Throw in the interesting side characters, a wannabe companion, an interesting use of the season motif of mirrors/doubles and I'm sold.

Last Christmas worked for similar reasons only it was focused on Clara and 12's relationship and we got to see her own conception of the fairly flat character of Danny.

**Asking the council for help with repairs**
 
Disrepair in your home can cause an unsafe living environment that could put your health at risk. Your local council may be able to help and can sometimes force landlords to do repairs.

**Key advice**

* Report problems to your landlord in writing and give a reasonable time to respond
* You can ask your council's environmental health department to inspect your home
* Report repairs to your landlord before contacting the council
* Before contacting the council, you must report any problems to your landlord in writing. Allow a reasonable time for repairs to start. What is a reasonable time depends on the urgency of the problem.
* 
If your landlord doesn't reply to your letters or takes too long to start repairs, tell your landlord you will be reporting the matter to the council's environmental health department (some councils call this the private sector housing team or housing standards), if the repairs are not done by a certain deadline.

Contact the council about disrepair in private rented homes
Contact your local council's environmental health department and ask it to carry out an inspection. Find its details in the phone book or on your council's website.

An environmental health officer should then carry out an inspection. This service is free and you can ask for your complaint to be kept confidential. How quickly the council carries out an inspection depends on the seriousness of the problem.

The environmental health officer assesses the property to work out if the problems are likely to be harmful to your health or to cause a nuisance to others. If they think that this is the case, the environmental health department must take action.

Use Shelter's sample letter to tell the council about your repair problems.

Council help with repair problems in private rented homes
Your local council's environmental health departments has a duty to inspect a property if it is told that the property is harmful to health. This usually includes properties affected by:
 
* damp, condensation and mould growth
* rats, cockroaches and other infestations
* broken glass, falling plaster, dangerous or decaying stairs
* faulty or dangerous gas or electrical installations
* blocked drains or problems with rubbish or sewage
* unacceptable noise levels
* damaged asbestos
* smoke fumes or gases
 
The environmental health department must also inspect a property if it has been told that it is causing a nuisance to neighbours or the public.
  
[...]

**Council action over disrepair in private rented homes**
 
The council's environmental health department only takes further action if it agrees that the problems are harmful to health or cause a nuisance to others.

In most cases, environmental health gives your landlord an improvement notice or an abatement notice. These tell your landlord to put the problem right and set a time limit by which any works must be completed.

If your landlord still doesn't do the work, the environmental health department can:

* do the repairs itself and charge your landlord for the work
* take your landlord to court – the court can order your landlord to do the work and/or fine them up to £5,000
* In some cases, the environmental health department may send your landlord an informal notice first. This warns your landlord that further action will be taken if they don't get the repairs done within a certain amount of time.

In emergency cases, the environmental health department can warn the landlord that it will do the work itself if repairs are not started within nine days, or if the landlord does not serve a counter notice within 7 days saying they intend to do the necessary work.

If the council does the repair work, it charges your landlord for the costs.",null,0,null,1426363023,null,0,false,0,cpewzoo,null,t3_2yxp00,null,t1_cpewzoo,null,t3_2yxp00,null,null,null,1427761918,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

My rear brakes seems to scrape when I turn the wheel should I be worried? (Front breaks similar although not as bad. This was happening before i did maintenance)
They will always scrape when a bit of surface rust builds up that's normal. It shouldn't slow the wheel.

Should I be worried about bits of orange rust? Should I clean again? - No but you need to clean/wire brush them off, it will only be waiting for you the next time you do it.

Engine sometimes pops which it never used to when I bought it? - Check the airways. So air, fuel, exhaust. Most air filters can be hoovered or washed. But again most bikes do pop so it could be normal.


I use my bike all the time and I've had all your symptoms and all i was told was try to keep it clean and well maintained. Over the years I've built up a bit of a process so I thought id just share a few key bits of what I do overall as my bikes in mint condition still, even my 97RR looks mint and im not anal with any of it it I just use a few products that work well.

Use ACF 50 on the metal that doesn't face water. Mines naked so the top of my engine, some covers, bolts etc. This creates a waterproof barrier that wears away between each wash. I spray it onto a cloth and rub it around liberally. The radiator or front of engine that get hit with spray won't benefit from it as it will wash away. But ACF50 is like cod liver oil for metal, it seems expensive but I barely buy 2 bottles a year.

Wax the paint. This keeps it flexible and stops it cracking as it ages. And means the grit will sit on the surface of the wax and reduce swirl marks caused by washing. Again liberally, little and often. It takes 5 mins to do on a naked. Meguiars cleaner wax in a tin not the liquid stuff is what I use as it goes on thick and buffs off easy and again a tin lasts ages.

Buy some brushes. Soft plastic brushes like bottle cleaners/toothbrushes are great for the radiator/manifold. Metal brushes are great for the chain and discs. And soft hair brushes are good for painted metal. But the brushes get right in small places like around the bolts on the engine and are one of my fave tools to use. You don't need expensive brushes all the ones i've tried are much of a muchness. I do have an awesome angled artists brush its ace for cleaning around the oil filter and kick stand.

Choose the right products for you. I've spent years buying different stuff and I still find it hard to settle. But a good degreaser and wax make life easy. At the moment for heavy crud removal on wheels and my engine and chain I use autoglym engine and machine cleaner and leave it to soak a few mins. I'm using WD40 chain cleaner, wax and lube which is the best I've tried so far but I still get surface rust from time to time. A meguiars water magnet is the best thing i've ever bought, ive had it over 5 years and its awesome. 

Get the tools to make the jobs quicker and easier. Buy a socket for your wheel nut, buy a half decent allen key set like a draper one. Get a paddock stand for the rear if you don't have a centre stand. All these bits make the job easy and quick so you will be happier doing it. I used to find it a twat to be honest but its a bit of a zen thing now as ive got my methods and i don't get skinned knuckles!

For the chain I spray it with the degreaser, leave it 5. Give it a light spray to wet it up again and brush it with a long thin metal brush by moving the rear wheel with my hand (never go near the chain or wheel if the engine is on you can loose fingers). I hose it down with my finger over the hose to give it a bit of pressure. Then it should come up clean, but it will still have crud in there. Spray the chain with a spray lube to push out any water and crap then wipe it down. At this stage it should look clean and dry and not have any build up, but it will still be slightly dirty inside the O rings. Now I go for a ride, just to fling the crap out and heat the chain up a bit. Then I put a few drops of oil and rub it over the chain with my hands then just spray wax the chain. I also use an oily rag to wipe over my sprocket and bolts to stop that rusting up. This is usually good for a few weeks I just top up depending on the mileage. 



Mistakes;
Gunk - I was told it was good for degreasing the chain but its way too strong. 

Ethyl Acetate - Great for cleaning parts but it reacts with paint even when the part has since dried like a fairing bolt.

Shoe Brush - Put swirl marks all over my wheels.

Back to black - Waste of everything time money etc.

Jet washing - Forces the grease out of everything. Smashes the grit along the paint. Gets under paint chips. Gets water in waterproof connectors.


TLDR; Buy the right bits for each little job.

You will become a more confident driver. They teach you techniques to improve your driving- for example how to go round corners smoothly. For your b, you don't necessarily get this from the course, but as part of the IAM you should be able to get on a skid pan course which I really recommend. The whole thing is geared towards making you a safer driver.

1) Fresh water in the kettle, put it on to boil. 

2) Find a tea pot and rinse it out. If you don't have a teapot, a mug will do. 

3) Once the kettles boiled, pour into either the pot or mug about 1/3 of the way up and swill it round to warm the pot up, then pour it out. 

4) Pop your teabag into your pot. If it's a large pot, put two in, but if you're making it in a mug only use one teabag. 

5) Pour the water in, but leave about an inch on the top if you're making it in a mug. 

6) Stir the bag in the water till it turns colour. Leave the bag in after a few stirs. You want it to brew a bit but not stewed. 

7) Take the bag out. Don't leave it on the side of the sink like a twat. Bin it. 

8) Pour the tea into a mug. Fetch the milk and sugar. 

9) Pour the milk in to fill the mug and add sugar if they take sugar in their tea. If you're unsure, just put some sugar in a bowl and pop a spoon in there. Make sure you stir the finished cocktail fully.

I am replacing it with a banshee 200, which my camping buddy uses as well, so I've got to test one. The doors being on the side mean you can get in/out much easier, there's more room and the biggest bonus is the poles attach to the rain sheet, meaning you keep the inside layer dry! And the dual door system allows you to air it out or keep it cool in summer :)

Something strange is going on, and that's a fact. On the 6th day nobody saw Putin. At least he did not appear in public. All the evidence Peskov and the Kremlin - a lie, and old photo \ video, which quickly exposed.

For example a very strange phenomenon during this time:

*  Putin canceled his trip to Astana due to illness.
*  The signing of the treaty of alliance between Russia and South Ossetia thwarted by mysterious reason.
*  Putin will not participate in the board of the FSB. (Previously never missed)
*  Photo and video that we were yesterday / today, and in general, made a long time, some in February, and some did in 2014-2013, respectively.
*  In Kazan big tragedy happened. Burned and collapsed a large shopping center, dozens of victims, a few days the Kremlin did not react today Medvedev offered his condolences in a tabular format. Prior to that, Putin is always at least expressed condolences and often personally visited. Now even through the media said nothing.
*  There clashes between bikers from the clan ""Night Wolves"" and Chechen politicians.
*  There is a rumor, and have already begun to pick up the prominent people and the media: Zolotov - Commando internal troops and bodyguard Putin - killed today. No one is denied some allegations.
*  Yesterday, at midnight, the Kremlin has been a lot of trucks.
*  The day before yesterday a helicopter flies over the Kremlin, 4-6 pieces. Military helicopters, by the way.
*  On television, the federal channels live Putin told the meeting, which should be on Monday, in the past tense, and even discussed. And we all have different stories and speakers too.


Here is a small hronlogiya events:

1.  Someone killed Nemtsov
2.  Investigative Committee hastened to blame everything on Chechens
3.  Ramzan Kadyrov tried to whitewash their
4.  Here Putin disappeared
5.  Peskov unconvincing lies
6.  Kabaeva is in Switzerland. Given birth or not - is unknown
7.  On the TV show low-quality Photoshop, immediately present themselves.
8.  Putin's Night Wolves fought with the Chechens.
9.  Hand tycoon Prokhorov was yesterday decided to close their party, as ""Project outlived its usefulness""
10.  Trucks taken something from the Kremlin tonight

Gathered all together for the last 2-3 days.

It helps by demonstrating to potential future employers that you can get off your arse, get in on time, work hard etc etc-- all things that are going to be a concern to any employer given we're talking about long-term unemployed here; by definition they've had a good amount of time to look 7 days a week and that hasn't worked.

In addition to that, it's going to help a few people stop feeling useless, get out the house, and make them feel that they are helping society.

It also establishes a link between working and having money, attacking the 'something for nothing' culture that is held by a minority of claimants.

&gt;To prove that an offence is racially or religiously aggravated, the prosecution has to prove the ""basic"" offence followed by racial or religious aggravation, as defined in section 28 Crime and Disorder Act 1998. An offence will be racially or religiously aggravated if:

 &gt;   a) at the time of the offence (or shortly before or after), the offender demonstrates to the victim hostility based on the victim's membership (or presumed membership) of a racial or religious group, or

&gt;    b) the offence is motivated wholly or partly by hostility towards members of a racial or religious group based on their membership (or presumed membership) of that group.
 &gt;
&gt;In DPP v McFarlane (2002) EWHC 485, Rose LJ found that once the ""basic"" offence was proved (in this case a public order offence) and that racist language was used that was hostile or threatening to the victim, it made no difference that the defendant may have had an additional reason for using the language. The test under section 28(1)(a) was satisfied.

&gt;In DPP v Woods (2002) EWHC 85, the defendant used racially abusive language to a doorman at a nightclub when expressing anger and frustration over being refused admission. It was held, as in McFarlane, that the fact that the primary reason for the offence was other than a racist motivation, the use of racist abuse during the commission of the basic offence made out the test for racial aggravation in section 28(1)(a). The point was made that, ordinarily, the use of racially (or religiously) insulting remarks would, in the normal course of events, be enough to establish a demonstration of hostility.

&gt;In R v Rogers (2007) 2 W.L.R. 280, the defendant was involved in an altercation with three young Spanish women during the course of which he called them bloody foreigners and told them to go back to your own country. The House of Lords, in upholding the defendants conviction, held that the definition of a racial group clearly went beyond groups defined by their colour, race, or ethnic origin. It encompassed both nationality (including citizenship) and national origins. The statute intended a broad non-technical approach. Furthermore the victim might be presumed by the offender to be a member of the hated group, even if s/he was not. Also, the fact that the offenders hostility was based on other factors as well as racism or xenophobia was irrelevant.

We ended up in an ambulance and were taken to the general hospital just off westgate road. We were sat there for around 2 hours when I headed off to grab some coffees. On coming back he was gone, the woman at reception let me know that he just wandered out of the place.

I caught up to him not far down the road and he was being followed and taunted by around 15 lads and lasses, all in their late teens and hammered. My assistant manager was a big bloke too, very built and I'm just not, but in his staggering state and with a large cut to his face already these kids thought they'd mess with him. A couple of glass bottles were thrown our way so we crossed the road only for them to catch up on the other side and the lot of them just jumped on him. Straight off I phoned the police and on a few of them catching on to what I was doing I got punched to the floor and continued to take the kicks until around 5/6 police cars roll up and another ambulance. 

By the time I got up my mate was a fair bit down the street still taking a beating. The police refused to go and help without first taking statements from on lookers. I even got put in cuffs for trying to go and help him myself. Eventually one of them rolls down in their car and everyone involved ran off. No attempt by the police to catch any of them and we ended up back in the same ambulance that had picked us up previously.

Most people I knew signing on wanted a job, the only issue was that some underestimated the amount of work they would have to put in or overestimated their skills.

I wanted to work in comms for charities. I volunteered at several charities in their press departments, I now work for a national charity as their press officer. 

However, I had to undergo many mandatory courses from the job centre completely irrelevant to my skills or desired job. They sent me on a course to become a bouncer despite the fact I am 5'5 and scrawny.

I interpret this as me needing A (highest possible grade in Sweden) in chemistry and then B in two courses relevant to my programme to have the equivalent of A*AA, correct?

null,false,bustedracquet,null,null,null,"Luis hasn't displaced Dave because of our tactics and the way we play, just like KDB wouldn't to Oscar. Luis doesn't play more because Hazard stays farther forward and we need somebody to cover for him, and Dave is miles faster than Luis. We already have an attacking fullback in Ivanovic who offers the same things going forward that Luis does, and we have a winger capable of covering him on that side with Willian/Cuadrado. That's why Luis doesn't play more. That doesn't mean he isn't a better player than Azpi, it just means that Azpi suits the way we play more. It's the same thing with KDB and Oscar. 

Form doesn't translate to different leagues? Right, yeah that's why Diego Costa has been a total flop for us this year. He's not the league leader in goals right? No of course not. Hey Eden Hazard suffered immensely from going Ligue 1 to the much more physical Premier League right which you said makes a HUGE difference? He didn't have 13 goals or anything in his first year? Gimme a break. A player of KDB's quality will be good anywhere, just like Hazard, Costa, Matic would. A great player is a great player regardless of league.

And of course, you can't just make your point without having to try and insult my football intelligence. You're not doing yourself any favors on that part, you refuse to explicitly state why you think Oscar is better than KDB. All you've stated is that the Bundesliga is slower and less physical, points which I've already tackled (btw your nuts if you don't think KDB is stronger than Oscar, he is), and how KDB is a focal point there which he wouldn't be here, which is redundant because I've already said Oscar is a better fit for this team. 

Just out of curiosity, what will it take from KDB to make you think he's better than Oscar? 20 goals and 20 assists in a season which he's well on his way to doing, which is a remarkable feat? Or are you going to say that all of KDB's accomplishments with Wolfsburg are irrelevant because in your eyes the Bundesliga is a significantly worst league than the Premier League (which btw, you better open your eyes as the Bundesliga is about to overtake the PL in coefficient). But wait, all the Bundesliga have in terms of top teams is Bayern Munich right? Good thing he didn't bag 2 goals and assist and a 9.7 match rating against arguably the best team in the world.

I already felt like the world's biggest failure when claiming JSA. If I had been made to pick litter I genuinely would have hit rock bottom.

'Work hard, go to uni and you'll get a good job' they told us at school. Now it's all, 'Oh, so you're too good to do that, are you?' We were sold a lie, and most people are quite rightly angry about that.

I did get a job eventually, 8 months after graduating. By the time I got it, I had already signed off JSA because of the threat of pushing me into 'work experience', even though I was already working 12 hours a week. The job I ended up getting paid a fair sight more than the shite the Jobcentre wanted me to apply for. Now I pay my taxes *and* pay my student loan back.

The interesting thing is that our formation makes a mid-fielder a bit limited when it comes to controlling the tempo of the game, it is more about finding quick passes and unlocking the defense or changing channels and that is why we haven's seen Emre do the same from mid-field as much as he is doing it from the back.

When he is acting as an RCB he is getting more time on the ball than the mid-fielders and is able to find more space to run into. I think he just might be that player that Gaurdiola struggled very hard to create when he was at Barca. Brendan has unlocked a gem here and his best comes when he plays at the back.

null,false,severedfragile,lfc68,,null,"No you didn't, ""he's got the stature &amp; defensive capabilities for it"" is vague as hell. You're suggesting a young, inexperienced player completely change position to a much more important and demanding role, you have to give proper reasons why he'd excel. 

Some reasons why he wouldn't?

Playing in a back 3 - especially a ball-playing back 3 like ours - requires a certain degree of calmness, concentration and positional intelligence. Flanno has none of those things. He's rash in going into tackles, is a bit of a ball-chaser and gets dribbled past constantly. Those aren't so bad if you're a full-back, but if you're a CB then fouls put the opponents near the goal or give them penalties and come with an increased risk of bookings and dismissals, being out of position - even a stride or two - not only allows opponents through to goal but also disrupts the entire defensive line (see Lovren's first couple months for far, far too many examples of this) and being passed on the wing so easily is especially troubling when you're asking him to be forced into the kinds of positions Can regularly excels in, potentially with Ibe or Markovic as the covering WB. He hasn't shown enough of an ability to shepherd the ball out, get between a winger and the ball, force them back, etc. in a role where he's able to do that with reduced defensive responsibility, we can't expect him to suddenly get good at all those things by sitting in the recovery room for months. You also end up losing the things that Flannagan's actually good at - aggressive running, tackling (which he can't do as much in his own third, even if he stops making rash challenges) and adding a physical presence to aid his teammates' pressing.

Flannagan's actually filled in at CB at youth level I think, so he has some training in the field, but not nearly enough - Can's actually had some limited experience there pre-Liverpool too, I believe. Part of the reason Can does it so well - aside from being a German-Turkish BeastPegasus is that he's had training as both a full-back and DM, so he's experienced and trained in things like positioning, covering spaces, shielding teammates, winning challenges without tackling, shepherding the ball, muscling people off the ball, deciding when to get forward and what pass to play, etc - all kinds of things that he's doing very well right now. He wasn't just thrown into a new position, there's a logical basis for believing he could adapt - his strength, skill set and training were all conducive to it (even then, it took an injury to put him in that position and Rodgers spent some time training with him there, an option that isn't really applicable to Flannagan who's just returned to training and isn't even match fit or match sharp, never mind in a position to adapt to a new position). I'm not convinced any of those apply to Flanno. 

Could he be a good CB? Probably not in my opinion, but it's not impossible. Could he develop into that position over the years? Hey, maybe. Is there any reason to think he'd excel in that position now, in a role that's been vital to our resurgence? Not that I can see. Licking my cat's asshole might make me fly, but I've got no reason to believe that and frankly, Mitzi's anus is doing the job expected of it just fine as things stand.

&gt;And every time, you remind them: yes. We were a colony. We were stripped of land, language, identity. We were routinely demonised and patronised.

As an Irishman that's not what I do, I just make a joke about the Brits trying to commit genocide and failing, earliest evidence of ""broken Britain"", couldn't even kill us off during a famine, fucking useless! I mock people who show ignorance, I don't get all pissed off about it. Every country has morons, every walk of life has idiots. Don't let it get to you, it's not a national attitude.

If we can't at least try to joke about the whole fucking thing and move on from it then what's the point? No point holding on to enmity, and no point letting a few ignorant idiots get to you. Vast majority of Brits hold no true prejudice, they just mock us like they mock eachother. The Welsh get it for fucking sheep, the Irish get it for Booze, the Scots get it for money, the English get it for pretty much everything.

&gt;And it needed to be on our terms because we were not, and never would be viewed as equals by the British establishment. Every Irish person in Britain knows the little nod, the little wink. More often now it is disguised as affection, or indulgence (“Oh, you funny people” is always implied). But the undertones are the same: feckless, violent, drunken

I'm Irish living in London for the last 4 + 1/2 years, 0 cases of racial insult from anyone other than potato jokes, or drunk stereotypes. I really hope we Irish aren't so weak as to be insulted by those - I just hit the Brits back with their stereotypes, a nation in decline, inbred aristocracy, bowing to the queen, piss poor food &amp; teeth etc.

Fucks sake, can't we all just insult eachother in good spirits and have done with it? What good does it do to take every insult personally? Anyone insulting you in a genuine way for being Irish deserves to get some stick back, some awkward jokes they don't like (used the genocide line on my HR director at the Christmas party after he mentioned something about spuds) to show what they are doing - they don't deserve to let it affect you.

&gt;the F-35 accounts for just over 40 percent of all openly planned spending on major programs after 2015.

http://www.pogo.org/our-work/straus-military-reform-project/weapons/2015/not-ready-for-prime-time.html

&gt;Inside-the-Beltway wisdom holds that the $1.4 trillion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program is too big to cancel and on the road to recovery. But the latest report from the Defense Department’s Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) provides a litany of reasons that conventional wisdom should be considered politically driven propaganda. The press has **already reported flawed software that hinders the ability of the plane to employ weapons, communicate information, and detect threats; maintenance problems so severe that the F-35 has an “overdependence” on contractor maintainers and “unacceptable workarounds” (behind paywall) and is only able to fly twice a week; and a high-rate, premature production schedule that ignores whether the program has demonstrated essential combat capabilities or proven it’s safe to fly.**

and

&gt;Overall, DOT&amp;E’s report reveals:

&gt; * The Joint Program Office, led by Lt. Gen. Bogdan, is re-categorizing or failing to count aircraft failures to try to boost maintainability and reliability statistics;
Testing is continuing to reveal the need for more tests, but the majority of the fixes and for capability deficiencies being discovered are being deferred to later blocks rather than being resolved;


&gt; * The F-35 has a significant risk of fire due to extensive fuel tank vulnerability, lightning vulnerability and an OBIGGS system unable to sufficiently reduce fire-sustaining oxygen, despite redesigns;

&gt; * Wing drop concerns are still not resolved after six years, and may only be mitigated or solved at the expense of combat maneuverability and stealth; 

&gt; * The June engine problems are seriously impeding or preventing the completion of key test points, including ensuring that the F-35B delivered to the Marine Corps for IOC meets critical safety requirements; no redesign, schedule, or cost estimate for a long-term fix has been defined yet, thereby further impeding g testing;
&gt; * Even in its third iteration, the F-35’s helmet continues to show high false-alarm rates and computer stability concerns, seriously reducing pilots’ situational awareness and endangering their lives in combat;

&gt; * The number of Block 2B’s already limited combat capabilities being deferred to later blocks means that the Marine Corps’ FY2015 IOC squadron will be even less combat capable than originally planned;

&gt; * ALIS software failures continue to impede operation, mission planning, and maintenance of the F-35, forcing the Services to be overly reliant on contractors and “unacceptable workarounds”;

&gt; * Deficiencies in Block 2B software, and deferring those capabilities to later blocks, is undermining combat suitability for all three variants of the F-35;

&gt; * The program’s attempts to save money now by reducing test points and deferring crucial combat capabilities will result in costly retrofits and fixes later down the line, creating a future unaffordable bow wave that, based on F-22 experience, will add at least an additional $67 billion in acquisition costs; and

&gt; * Low availability and reliability of the F-35 is driven by inherent design problems that are only becoming more obvious and difficult to fix.

Kind of... but completely the opposite (I think?).  The hydraulic fluid won't compress but the air does, so when you stand on the brake you can't build up the pressure to activate the pads as much as you would like - hence pumping the brakes which will build up the pressure temporarily and allow you to come to a stop.

I'm not sure if it will come out of the system naturally (you might have to shake the car up and down or something to get the bubbles out of the lines) as there will be a one way valve in the master cylinder.

&gt;Flights sciences testing for the F-35A lagged behind its test flight and test point goals for CY14 as the test centers prioritized resources to focus on Block 2B mission systems testing. Flight sciences testing for the F-35B and F-35C maintained overall test point productivity by accomplishing additional test points for Block 3F, while lagging behind planned progress for completing Block 2B. 

&gt;Slower than planned progress in mission systems, weapons integration, and F-35B flight sciences testing delayed the completion of the testing required for Block 2B fleet release. The program now projects this to occur by the end
of January 2015, instead of the end of October 2014 as was previously planned.

&gt;Restrictions imposed on the test fleet as a result of the engine failure in June reduced test point availability and slowed progress in mission systems and flight sciences testing from July through November. For example, the
effect on mission systems testing was approximately 17 percent loss of productivity in accomplishing test points, from 210 points accomplished per month prior to the engine restrictions to approximately 175 points per month.

&gt;Discoveries of deficiencies continued to occur in later versions of Block 2B software, further slowing progress. For example, completion of weapons delivery accuracy events lagged the plans for CY14 and was put on hold in
August when the program discovered a deficiency in the F-35 navigation system. 

&gt;The program develops and fields ALIS in increments similar to the mission systems capability in the air vehicle. Overall, ALIS is behind schedule, has several capabilities delayed or deferred to later builds, and has been fielded
with deficiencies. The program does not have a dedicated end-to-end developmental testing venue for ALIS and has relied on feedback from the field locations for identifying deficiencies. Though some of the early deficiencies have been addressed, ALIS continues to be cumbersome to use
and inefficient, and requires the use of workarounds for deficiencies awaiting correction. 

It goes on... and on... and on... and on... Also the F35 was supposed to enter service in 2010... It's now 2015 and its 500 billion over budget and no end in sight. So disingenuous much right the fuck back atcha.

If you're more technically minded you can use VPN and DNS services to access the Netflix US library which is even bigger. 

The NowTV box is costs £19.99 and is basically a subsidised entry-level Roku box. You get 3 months free Entertainment pack (worth £21) or 2 months Movie Pack (worth £22) and there's no contract.  

If you have a bit of capital to invest, the Roku 3 is a great device. You can install apps, so you get iPlayer, 4od, youtube, Google Play, NowTV and Netflix among others. It costs &amp;lt;£100. 

Another way to go about it is with a Chromecast, which fits into your TV's HDMI port and will let you stream Netflix/NowTV from your phone. The advantage here is you can use the iPlayer app and the apps for 4od, etc. The Google Chromecast works best with Android and costs £30. You can get 3 months of free NowTV with it too.  The AppleTV is a bit more expensive and doesn't get free NowTV (but if you have an iPhone, it's probably the better option).

Also: don't believe the hype - the TiVo box is shite. I have Virgin TV too and it's absolutely pointless. It's slow and there really very little that's any good that I can't get on Netflix at less than half the price.

The Voodoo is good if you like rock/metal. Great beer, good music and nice staff. They also do gigs, with everything from dub reggae to death metal.

null,false,Urbanen,null,null,null,"I remove a caliper, which is an easy job. Then give it a spray and clean, as usual with the brushes and a brake or carb cleaner. Wurths spray stuff is pretty good but theres a big 5l bottle of pagid stuff you can get cheap that's as good too. Then I push the pistons back and forth until I'm happy they are 100% grit/grime free. Re-fit the calipers. 

The pistons are what get stuck and cause the brakes to lock on. And if the fluid leaks you need to replace the seals in the caliper. I've never seen a bike caliper in such a state though.

I have a track bike and found that sanding the pads down after a session keeps them keen. I only give my road bike pads a sanding to remove any glazing. This looks shiny and rarely happens unless you get the pads pretty hot. But generally I just check there's enough life in the pads and replace if not. The pads are usually fine. I never remove the discs I just wire brush and clean them with the brake cleaner.

Also if you have left the bike outside and its been wet and windy the brakes can stick. The best thing for them is to use them, they will be a bit noisy so be gentle and the crap will be removed from the pads. This isn't the pistons sticking its the disc and pad getting a bit of surface rust.

Then I refit everything.

I always take my time but when it comes to the brakes check every bolt. Make sure the calipers are aligned perfectly and that the wheel rotates. Squeeze the lever and make sure everything is looking good. Then take it for a ride remembering you have covered your discs and pads in chemicals so you need to burn them off. I've never had any problems. 

If your bike judders when you brake its often the disc has warped. Braided hoses are used as the rubber ones expand when they get hot. And a bigger master cylinder is like using a bigger pump so you get more power with a smaller squeeze. Thats pretty much everything i've ever had to deal with on the brake side.

It is a place renowned for poverty, prostitution and crime.

The interesting thing is the local secondary school, Sidney Stringer Academy, is classed as outstanding. It is also placed in the top 2% of schools in the country for student progress. 

An outstanding school and yet it is situated amongst almost absolute poverty. A run down part of the city, with the only highlight being student accommodation on the inner edge just before the University. Terraced housing in need of dire renovation, limited services and facilities, streets full of litter and dirt, parents on minimum wage jobs or out of work, high levels of immigration and a huge variety of nationalities. 

I work in a local business and homeless people regularly come in to ask for a drink of water/coffee and to use the facilities, I have been threatened with violence and threats of being killed at work by customers, and local infrastructure is collapsing at the seams (Roads, City Centre and the Walsgrave Hospital). West Midlands Police are expecting massive cuts to their funding over the next few years, regardless of who gets into power, and the Walsgrave hospital will not be given any further help to deal with massive demand. Drop in centres take hours to see you and GP's are booked for weeks on end. 

Yet through it all business seems to be thriving for us. We never have a day where we don't make money and the demand is there. It has made me seriously question the link between Capitalism and society. I'm doing ok and the business I work for is thriving. Yet clearly there are issues in society that are being ignored. Are the two mutually exclusive or is there something these businesses can do? Is it something they should do? Whose responsibility is it? 

I am of the view that the 'roughest' parts of any city reveal the true nature of our society. When the shit hits the fan, when the cards are on the table and somebody is in trouble - who is there to help? If you found yourself one day, for whatever reason, with absolutely nothing and nobody who would help -  who should help you? Is it meant to be society, a kind soul, family, friends? The roughest part of cities show you what support is available for the truly needy. In Coventry that help is almost non-existent.

Chester could be do-able at a push in terms of travel time, though with not having lived there for years I don't know what commute times'd be like - Arrowe Park is relatively close to the M53 though, so you might be ok. Chester's lovely and that would be my choice, if I had to move back. 

I don't know if there's an area particularly preferred by medical staff, but going on Cambridge where I now live, I imagine the nearer the radius, the better. I live about 1.5 miles from Addenbrookes hospital and my village and those within about the same distance are all preferred by the docs/nurses because of the convenience.

Don't really agree, we cruised through our CL group, beat Arsenal at home, Liverpool away and over 2 legs in the COC semi, Spurs at home and in the COC final. We also haven't lost in 2 games vs. City and away to Man U, sure there's room for improvement but that is still a great record...you can't expect to beat every one each time, that's what makes them ""top teams"". Furthermore, we have yet to face Liverpool, Man U, and Arsenal for our 2 round of fixtures in the league and if we win 2 or 3 of those you'll be singing a different tune. 

The characterization of Chelsea as a ""flair team"" is off, a flair team doesn't even attempt to play as conservatively as we often do. A Mourinho team is and always has been adaptable, against appropriate opposition there is more flair than against the big boys. 

I'd actually characterize our problem as almost identical to the last few seasons: inability to finish chances. Apart from the first third or so of the season when Costa was scoring we've struggled to put the ball in the net in matches when our chances our limited. It's not rocket science, nearly every team struggles when their striker does. We'll be in bad form so long as Costa is, or until a replacement like Remy (should that ever happen) plays well instead.

&gt;__Dolphins__ are [cetacean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean) mammals closely related to [whales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale) and [porpoises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porpoise). There are almost forty species of dolphin in 17 [genera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus). They vary in size from 1.2 m (4 ft) and 40 kg (90 lb) ([Maui's dolphin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui%27s_dolphin)), up to 9.5 m (30 ft) and 10 tonnes (9.8 long tons; 11 short tons) (the [orca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_whale) or killer whale). They are found worldwide, mostly in the shallower seas of the [continental shelves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_shelves) and are carnivores, eating mostly [fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish) and [squid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid). The [family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology\)) [Delphinidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_dolphin), the largest in the [order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology\)) [Cetacea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacea), evolved relatively recently, about ten million years ago during the [Miocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene).

On board, May drank a bottle of wine, but Clarkson drank nothing as he had to work on a script later that evening.

Filming had been fraught because of the shortage of producers and Clarkson was tired, annoyed and hungry, having had nothing to eat all day, the sources say. And it was against this background, that they arrived at the hotel to be told there was no hot supper. What happened next will have to be established by the BBC’s inquiry.

I respect what Nolan has done for us but he can't play at this level anymore, not as a starter, and we definitely need a change upfront. I honestly would prefer it if we just off loaded Carroll somehow. It's hard to have an educated opinion about him because he's been sidelined most of the time. He showed flashes of potential while he was healthy this season, but at this point I just don't think it's worth it to spend the time on him anymore, harsh as that may be. He's injury prone and, given the nature of his injuries, it will remain the same or get worse at this point.

If I had to pick what to focus on though, I'd definitely  concentrate on our midfield. I think Sakho and Valencia have the potential to do great things for us, but there's a marked lack of confidence in their play now. If we can get our midfield in order it'll naturally boost our performance up front. Defensively I think we are ok. Not great, but not in a bad place either, if anything that'd be something I'd address in the January transfer window next season.

Also, I really hope we can sign Jenks over the summer.

Yeah I guess I'm not adding anything new to the conversation lol.

I do hope big sam is out with this season's end though. I'm actually ok with the bloke. He got us back in and he's kept us there, and we ought to respect that.

&gt;Environment Agency staff working in the area noticed the wound and alerted the RSPCA who intervened. 

&gt;He lived in a specially-built ark at Mr Skinner’s idyllic old mill cottage – a bed-and-breakfast in Corfe Mullen, Dorset. The animal was a star attraction with numerous online reviews singing its praise.

&gt;'He [Mr Skinner] had been aware of the wound for four weeks and the only treatment had been bathing the wound. 'It was obvious to anyone who saw Mr Pig that he had a horrible, painful injury - and yet he was not taken to a vet and he was left to suffer for almost a month until the RSPCA became involved.

&gt;“Mr Pig was confirmed by both the prosecution and defence vets to have been suffering significantly for three to four weeks from an untreated tumour on his face. Vets felt that, had he received treatment earlier, this suffering could have been avoided. “However, veterinary treatment was not sought and Mr Skinner admitted causing unnecessary suffering to his pig.'”

&gt;The RSPCA attempted to contact the owner several times over 24 hours before the pig was put to sleep but no response was received. Given the extent of the suffering, vets felt that he should be put to sleep imminently to relieve his discomfort.

&gt;Mr Skinner admitted the offence after conceding he was technically in breach of animal welfare laws but Mr Foster said his client knew Mr Pig would have to be put down and was “bringing himself to that point” when the RSPCA was informed. 

Honestly I don't see a problem with how the RSPCA acted here.  Maybe the prosecution was excessive but equally even if he was blinded by love for his pet (as his defense lawyer argued) he should have done something more to ease it's suffering like any sensible animal owner.  The owner has a 1 million pound bed and breakfast on a private island so he's not exactly unable to pay for a vets bills.  If this article was flipped around to be talking about say an old dog with a painful tumor on it's face that had been left untreated for almost a month I think most people would approve of the RSPCA's action.  It's an awful decision to have to make when your pet is coming to the end of it's life and it's time to put it to sleep rather than let it suffer but he should have done it much earlier.",null,0,null,1426383821,null,0,1426384418,0,cpf6vlc,null,t3_2z0qoo,null,t1_cpf6vlc,null,t1_cpf0ikn,null,null,null,1427766975,null,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12,null

null,false,joepo32,null,null,null,"&gt;Luis hasn't displaced Dave because of our tactics and the way we play, just like KDB wouldn't to Oscar. Luis doesn't play more because Hazard stays farther forward and we need somebody to cover for him, and Dave is miles faster than Luis. We already have an attacking fullback in Ivanovic who offers the same things going forward that Luis does, and we have a winger capable of covering him on that side with Willian/Cuadrado. That's why Luis doesn't play more. That doesn't mean he isn't a better player than Azpi, it just means that Azpi suits the way we play more. It's the same thing with KDB and Oscar. 

Dave plays because he is better than Luis. It's really that simple. He is more reliable on one on on defending. He can basically eliminate an attack from the side. Luis is a very good back as well but he is slightly less reliable than Dave. Dave also plays forward quite a bit. Our system suits both of them equally. Dave is just better. 

&gt;Form doesn't translate to different leagues? Right, yeah that's why Diego Costa has been a total flop for us this year. He's not the league leader in goals right? No of course not. Hey Eden Hazard suffered immensely from going Ligue 1 to the much more physical Premier League right which you said makes a HUGE difference? He didn't have 13 goals or anything in his first year? Gimme a break. A player of KDB's quality will be good anywhere, just like Hazard, Costa, Matic would. A great player is a great player regardless of league.

There are plenty of more players that are on top of their game and make the switch to the PL and can't do anything. They turn out as flops. KDB and hazard can't even be put in the same comparison. Hazard is years ahead of him in talent. Costa is designed for the PL and played at Madrid and they play near the same style as us. Wolfsburg does not.  Matic had to leave the PL to gain more experience before he could come back and make it.  KDB wouldn't make it at Chelsea. Playing for a team like Wolfsburg or in the shitty German league doesn't show he can either.  

&gt;And of course, you can't just make your point without having to try and insult my football intelligence. You're not doing yourself any favors on that part, you refuse to explicitly state why you think Oscar is better than KDB. All you've stated is that the Bundesliga is slower and less physical, points which I've already tackled (btw your nuts if you don't think KDB is stronger than Oscar, he is), and how KDB is a focal point there which he wouldn't be here, which is redundant because I've already said Oscar is a better fit for this team. 

You've tackled those issues? 

&gt;Just out of curiosity, what will it take from KDB to make you think he's better than Oscar? 20 goals and 20 assists in a season which he's well on his way to doing, which is a remarkable feat? Or are you going to say that all of KDB's accomplishments with Wolfsburg are irrelevant because in your eyes the Bundesliga is a significantly worst league than the Premier League (which btw, you better open your eyes as the Bundesliga is about to overtake the PL in coefficient). But wait, all the Bundesliga have in terms of top teams is Bayern Munich right? Good thing he didn't bag 2 goals and assist and a 9.7 match rating against arguably the best team in the world. 

He would have to play in a league that is equivalent to playing Bayerns Practice squad. The Bundesliga isn't even close to having the depth of talent spread across the whole league as the PL. He wouldn't displace Oscar in our team and I dont think he has the quality to play for Chelsea in the PL. He is a good player for Wolfsburg but I don't think he as good as people think he is.

For a human being I would agree unless it had significant safeguards in place (e.g multiple layers of medical consent).  

For an animal I do think it is a little different especially when they are extremely old as was the case for this pig.  I really don't believe that the RSPCA would have acted immediately unless the animal was in significant pain and the decision to put it to sleep would have been taken after inspection by a vet.  The reason the man wouldn't take it to a vet in the first place is that he knew it would have to be put down so he was basically keeping it alive for his personal gain rather than truly considering the welfare of the animal.

From what I think were [the guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/388934/45584_Prevent_duty_guidance-a_consultation_Web_Accessible.pdf), any external speaker coming to talk at a university would have to be vetted individually, meaning:

* booked at least 14 days in advance,
* provide advance notice of topics to be discussed,
* provide in advance all slides, footage etc. to be shown,

Plus universities would have to have all kinds of policies in place to monitor, rate/assess risks, enforce etc. events, including those off-campus but advertised on-campus. And filter Internet access etc., and so on.

According to that Christian group, Theresa May had claimed that these rules would have no impact on ""genuine, benign and well-intentioned student bodies.""

I guess that she's the one who gets to decide what counts as genuine, benign or well-intentioned.

- I recommend Stranmills, Lisburn Road or Botanic Ave for living arrangements. All are within walking distance of Queen's

- Yeah there are a lot of furnished flats. You shouldn't have a problem there.

- check out www.gumtree.com. Should be able to find some flatmates on there.

- Belfast is definitely a walking city. You can walk to most places in 20-30 minutes. It also has a decent system of buses that run fairly frequently.

- The people here are really friendly and outgoing so make sure you hone your conversational skills for the banter. There really aren't too many drastic differences but it's a beautiful place with a lot of interesting people and a great cultural background. You'll enjoy your time here.

Dzeko and Aguero do not gel. They're not a formidable strike partnership like Aguero/Negredo were. Dzeko and Bony are both lone forwards (target men) and will thrive in that position. The only downside is that Aguero (while incredible) visibly has a huge ego and gets upset whenever he isn't playing while fit. This forces Pellegrini to play him (same case with Yaya) at every opportunity.

So when we decide to pack the midfield and go 4-5-1, we play Aguero instead of a target man and all of the crosses and wide play turns to shit because Aguero is not a target man. Therefore even with the extra man in midfield, we have no one to aim for when we're penning the opposition in.

Lol the the PL has the most depth spread out across every team in the league compared to any other league. Then La liga, Serie A, Bundesliga.

Firing Rodgers. If you need this one explaining to you, seriously, what the fuck?

Borini. After watching him at Sunderland and seeing his desire to stay, PLUS how well he fits the high-energy style I thought he'd have a Hendo-esque turnaround.

1) Our education system at primary is 3/4 years to 10/11 years of age, then Secondary/Grammar is 12-19+ followed by collage/University. It is quite archaic if I'm honest, in comparison to most other European school systems. We are taught much the same as you guys, but It is somewhat traditionalist and historical heritage-based concepts from a young age....and then we usually get jaded by the religious overtones and become disenfranchised bigots because it rains a lot and we only get 3 days of summer a year....no that's not true at all, we sometimes get 4 days of sunshine, then it rains, then snows.. in the same day. In all seriousness though, we are relativity tolerant and hard working people, and our steady, yet fluctuating economy is proof of that. Our education system has been for the most part farming, and industrial engineering-based. We have a lot of large corporate industrial estates for such a small land. Of course Arable farming is a high standard also. Thanks RAIN.

2) Cultural heritage is mostly the same as other western European countries also, but this island has had a fair amount of cultural influence in the last few era's of civilisation. Ranging mostly from Nordic/Viking Germanic and Gaelic tribes. This has also made for a lot of historical political turmoil, but that's a whole other history lesson in itself. Confinement to small land has always produced very particular culture through music and craft. We have produced some very underrated ""world-class"" engineers, musicians, and athletes, which we never take for granted, because we already know how good we are. (modest)

3) I do believe that our sectarian conflictions will always be a part of this land. There has been a lot of innocent blood split over a few hundred years. But since humanity have all become more of a Global family, I think that future generations will make up the rules which will break down those prejudices that have simmered on this land for generations. The common ground now is that Sectarianism is all around the world, and if you are subjected to it enough, then you become accustomed to it, admonish it, and it ultimately becomes irrelevant in modern society. Nobody wants to fight, but we don't pretend that we didn't fight, and simply choose not to now for the sake, and sanity of the next generation.

4) Tayto cheese and onion crisp sandwiches, Soda farls. Desert is usually any food that is sugar based, or alcohol. (look.. it rains a lot here, Its mostly grey skies and we are quite stoically depressed.) Ah but those 4 days of sunshine a year? BBQ time.

I hope this was informative for you and helped your curiosity. I was drunk when I started this reply, and I'm actually sober now. Time for sleep. Best of luck to ya Swedish person!

It's similar to how Australia used to manage wool - the gov't wanted to assure farmers a price for wool, but knew that mandating a floor price would leave some farmers out high and dry. So instead, the gov't offered to buy a limitless quantity of wool at the floor price. This way a floor price can be maintained *and* every farmer is able to actually sell their wool for that price.

A JG is just that applied to jobs. Rather than mandating a minimum wage w/ no assurance people will actually be able to find jobs paying that wage, the gov't instead offers to buy any quantity of labour at a fixed price point.
