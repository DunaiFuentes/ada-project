He is a brilliant manager, no doubt. This year was hard for him though, the winning run last spring was most likely very intensive for him and it probably made him almost mentally dead all the work behind that, not just any team could win 13 PL games in a row in modern times and it obviously took some tough work to do that. Then the summer was very tough, we had to sell Suarez as he was too keen to join Barca. We lost a player that you can't put into words the importance of and we bought a lot of players, raw players to replace him, unfortunatley losing out on a machine called Alexis Sanchez who was the only realistic replacement for Suarez. Now all this was a HUGE shock for the whole team and especially Rodgers that they had no one to play the role of Suarez in the upcoming season. Now that the situation was like this, Rodgers had organize the team to play on the same level without that Sanchez or Suarez... and no surprise ladies and gentleman that. is. hard. Even for someone like Ancelotti or Guardiola, that would've been some tough shit to do and it would've taken some time, just like Rodgers. Now, the season starts and there are injuries like Lallana and Sakho and then Sturridge got injured so we had Balotelli who is forbidden from scoring in the PL and Lovren who still played like the mid table player he was and had a hard time matching our level and then there were players out of form like Markovic, Mignolet and Johnson and it's a disaster to have to manage a team like that. And obviously results were not going to play with us. Now all that weird press conferences from Brendan Rodgers where he was praising the players after draws and losses are totally explanable, in simple word he was building up the team's confidence with these comments because confidence was what a lot of players were lacking in the first part of the season and that was a key factor to the bad luck. Anyway, those press conference and interview 'skills' are paying back right now with players shining with confidence and showing more ambition and we can just see the season taking a U turn right now for us and Ridgers has found a tactic that got us performing very similarly to last season and of course WITHOUT that Suarez/Alexis machine we thought we needed, simply because Brendan Rodgers is quite literally a genius.

I think the reason we're playing better now (although we're still struggling a bit) is a total system restart. I think in the summer we prepared to play the same football that we did last year; we didn't have Suarez but we still had Sturridge. And, in Rodgers defense, it worked. We beat a very strong Southampton-side (no one knew how strong they really were at the time), went to the Etihad and gave a good performance despite some bad luck, and demolished Tottenham.

Without Sturridge, however, without a world class striker, this plan falls apart. Rodgers didn't have a plan B, confidence fell and we started performing like shit. Our play was shit, our results were shit.

I think this was an oversight for Rodgers. It's bad luck that our best player is absent for six months, but he should have had a plan B. He didn't and it cost us.

But do you think he'll ever make the same mistake again? Rodgers is young, he's quite inexperienced. He will have learned from this. It took to long, there was to much waiting for Sturridge, but some time in November I think he said ""fuck it, we need to find a whole new way to play football"". And we have. The strengths for people like Lallana and Coutinho are being played to. We're using a strong, defensive midfielder because we can't rely on outscoring our opponent every game anymore. We're going with three at the back, Can has been made into a CB, Markovic into a WB. We're starting to win the game from the midfield, and not rely so much on our strikers; Balotelli, Borini and Lambert just aren't Sturridge or Suarez.

But, true to himself, we're still seeing Brendan in this system. High pressing, high work-rate, the possession-based football he was known for prior to last year. The defense is getting tighter, the creativity is coming back.

Keep in mind about yesterday's performance that we we're missing 3 of our 5 best players (Sterling, Sturridge, Lallana). The second half was dreadful, but I'm sure Rodgers is on it.

I've had my doubts about him, who hasn't. But he's shown up, shown why he's a good manager, why he will become a great one. We won't get CL this year. We might not get it next year either. But if we can keep Coutinho, if we can keep Sturridge, Lallana, Henderson, Can, Markovic, Manquillo, these young, quite experienced players, then we have a real shot at a fantastic squad in the future.


Things at Liverpool aren't going as good as we'd all like them to. But I still see good things ahead. And Brendan is a key part of that!",null,0,null,1420958070,null,0,false,0,cnl9ut4,null,t3_2rzu2j,null,t1_cnl9ut4,null,t1_cnkw52l,null,null,null,1424941397,null,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11,null

Of course it sounds appropriate on paper but if you continually reduce staff's free time - time to rest and to spend with their family - then you will end up with overworked, overtired staff who make mistakes and become resentful, and who will ultimately leave. My wife - nurse - now has to work an insane number of weekends - sometimes double weekends - something that was required less in recent years, and the demand is getting worse. Currently she's paid a bit extra for these but frankly we'd both rather she didn't have to. Sometimes she ends up working 3 double weekends in a row - that means we don't get a break for 5 weeks in a row.... I run my own business and we have two kids so being able to rest is hard enough as it is without that on top. We have hardly any time together as a family and planning holidays (once every couple of years if we are lucky) is extremely difficult. You *have* to offer people a reason to sacrifice their free time like this. People are people, not robots. It cannot all be about offering the best service - rundown staff will result in mistakes. The financial waste in the NHS due to gross overspending on things like TVs and tables and general items is *huge* - something that nobody seems to know or talk about. There are so many better ways for the NHS to save money than screwing over their staff.

Mourinho is a big fan of theirs, and it's obvious how he is emulating them with the way he's building our team. I had a hunch he would try to copy their style when he came back. His last match managing Madrid was the Copa del Rey final vs Atletico and Simeone where Real Madrid lost 2-1 in the Bernabeu. 

It became more obvious when Mourinho took over Chelsea and got to create a new team. He saw that Simeone's blueprint is the future. What did Mou do the minute he got to Chelsea? Froze out fan-favorite Juan Mata and told Oscar that he will be the new number 10. Mata is a lazy player, who doesn't know how to press (granted his attacking abilities are **world class**), so the choice of Oscar, a smarter number 10 who has quite an engine in him was obvious.

He dove into the market and got Willian, a hard working winger who also has an unbelievable engine in him and put him in right midfield. Eden Hazard was told to begin tracking back, as the team couldn't lose all attacking talent (coupled with the fact that Eden is more than capable of pressing and defending after receiving tutelage of Mourinho). Later he noticed the midfield needed fresh legs. Lampard was too old and Mikel or Ramires are good, but not good enough for what Mourinho had in mind.

In came Nemanja Matic, Mourinho's Gabi. The central midfielder that will destroy everything that tried to get by him. But he still needed that creative spark from midfield. He needed a Koke. A set piece specialist, capable of putting the ball exactly where the set piece demanded it. Fabregas on sale, you say? Perfect. Mou flies out to Spain and drops his son's final, and convinces Cesc to be his Koke. 

It was starting to look like a real team. But he needed the cherry on top. Fernando Torres, Samuel Eto'o and Demba Ba hadn't delivered in the Premiership. He looked at what Simeone had. Falcao. But Monaco shat on everyone and signed him in the most bizzare transfer of 2013. So Mourinho just took what Simeone had. Chelsea paid 32m pounds and got the Atletico Madrid poacher, who netted 36 times in the 2013-14 season. It was done. The addition of Thibaut Courtois, ironically from Atletico Madrid (thus meaning he was well accustomed to their playing style and giving instructions to defenders) and Filipe Luis, also from Atletico, made the team even more complete. 

So yeah. I fancy them. But I don't have any a plans of buying an Atletico shirt. Will be interesting if we face them again. Perhaps the result will be more different this time, as Mourinho finally got to build his now finished team, in contrary to Simeone, who've had the same team (bar Falcao) since his arrival in 2011.",null,0,null,1420961321,null,0,false,0,cnlaw2r,null,t3_2s1gw2,null,t1_cnlaw2r,null,t3_2s1gw2,null,null,null,1424940914,null,-4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,-4,null

That's funny because on a recent thread about straight guys holding hands and getting abused, the heterosexuals on this sub told us we are ""ridiculous"" for not liking being stared at on a first date (because gay people are unusual and therefore should expect to be treated like zoo animals in 2015 and not being happy about that is ""ridiculous"" apparently) and told me I was ""ridiculous"" for being worried about stares despite such stares preceding every homophobia attack ever (including one which put my ex in the hospital) and then proceeded to tell me that gay people don't even get attacked anymore (even though my ex was hospitalised and hate crimes are still frequent which they would know if they gave even a *single* shit for once in their life) and I'm just trying to play the victim (even though we are literally victimised). 

Anytime I try to talk about homophobia, they guilt trip me and make me feel like I'm a terrible person by saying I'm an attention seeker who loves playing victim and undermine everything I say, telling me I'm ridiculous for being worried about being stared at when I'm trying to have a relaxed and romantic first date as they get to frolick with their little girlfriends wherever and whenever they want without having to put up with any of the crap I do but demand I put up with it as if they know what it's like 

So of course they downvoted me to -5 (for being ""ridiculous"" by not liking being treated like a zoo animal and being concerned me and my date are about to be hospitalised, fuck me right?) and upvoted another guy to +5 for saying ""I live in an Asian country and get stared at for being white so you should stop moaning"" as if being stared at for being white is the same as being stared at for being gay and comes with the same risk of violence and attack, they know it's not the same but needed a mascot to rally around anyway because they need to explain to gay people why their experience isn't valid and undermine them as usual using their trademark heterosexual expertise on the experiences of gay people and homophobia and another one of their classic false equivalencies 

This sub is just another batch of spoiled heterosexual white boys who hand wave away any problem which doesn't affect them and tell minorities they're ridiculous for being concerned with problems they themselves will never have to deal with and instead of trying to see things from their perspective or emphasise with their experience they just tell them they're paranoid and overly sensitive instead and guilt trip them and make them feel like a bad person, all because they're so privileged and spoiled they are physically unable to understand why it's a big deal to others when it's such a non-big deal to them, so obviously everyone else is wrong and they're right and they just need to explain to these minorities why they're wrong 

So excuse me for questioning whether this sub is any different to the others when they have the same selfish and arrogant attitudes and don't give a shit about gay people unless they can use us to make themselves look good and any time we actually try to talk about our problems they tell us to stop moaning because our problems don't exist anymore and guilt trip us and make us feel like a bad person simply for standing up for ourselves and trying to improve our situation, as if they'd know anything about that. 

The only thing people on this sub has done for gay people is say ""I support equal marriage"" on the internet for the bonus liberal cool points, the only other thing they've done for gay people is undermine their experience, guilt trip them, call them attention seekers who just want to play victim and generally make them feel like bad people. 

That's all people on this sub have done for gay people like me, undermine and disrespect me. If they can't get anything out of us they couldn't give two shits and would rather gag us so our cries of pain don't spoil their pleasant evening instead of listening to what we have to say.

*Series 3:* Blink - The obvious choice maybe, but Blink is popular for a reason.

*Series 4*: Midnight - Probably my favourite episode of New Who, it's quite intense and does a great job at dissecting human nature.

*Series 5:* The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang - The best finale of New Who, it was dramatic,  intricate and well written.

*Series 6:* Impossible Astronaut/Day of Moon - A great two-parter that brilliantly established Series 6's story. It's unfortunate the story's resolution wasn't as good.

*Series 7:* Asylum of the Daleks - There were no great episodes in series 7, but this one was pretty good. Bad marriage subplot aside, it did an excellent job introducing Clara, and made great use of the Daleks.

*Series 8:* Listen - Really well written, tense, and I love the ambiguity of the Monster's existence.

*Christmas*: A Christmas Carol - Really heartwarming episode that actually explores the use of time travel rather than just using it as a framing device.

*Specials*: Day of the Doctor - A really well done and epic extended episode, 10 and 11 together was hilarious and the War Doctor was great.

*Mini Episodes*: The Night of the Doctor - Paul McGann. Enough said.

Tomkins released what was essentially a season review entitled: 'They dared to dream. How Liverpool went so close.'

Many people including myself took issue with the title. Personally I think the title belittles us, and it sounds like we are glorifying failure, it sounds to me like something I'd expect a L2 club to release after getting to the fa cup 5th round or something.

I should point out that he writes these books every year, so he's not glorifying anything, but IMO and that of many others the TITLE makes it seem that way. Nobody criticised the content of the book as far as I know.

Many people including myself tried to put our point regarding the title to Paul on twitter and he got a little irate and defensive. His response was that we were stupid and wrong. He told me directly that any negative connotations being taken from the title were being inferred incorrectly and he wasn't to blame. I put it to him that if a lot of people are inferring the same thing then maybe he should acknowledge the title was partly to blame but he wasn't having none of it.

The next day he published a rebuttal titled: FUCK YOU BANTZ BOYZ.

Why a serious writer needs to put fuck you in a title I have no idea. It was at that point that I my reservations about him being a bit of an arsehole and a bully were confirmed and I gave up reading the site.

Fake adverts are, id say, 99% a thing of the past. There's just no need to do them, plus advertising is very expensive.

Just because they don't get back to you, doesn't mean that their advert is fake.

The vast majority of the time, you're not getting called back because you're not deemed right for the role.

If you're looking for a new job, don't just send your CV off an then hold your breath. You need to be more proactive. I'd not recommend uploading your CV to joboards because you'll be inundated with phone calls, but do a bit of research. Look up recruiters that specialise in your line of work locally, and call them. 

A recruiter will only call you if you're right for the role that he/she are recruiting.

Should we privatise the NHS completely - no, stupid idea but some privatisation in it isn't a bad idea.

Is the NHS portraying Christian values - maybe, but also Buddhist, Muslim, Jewish &amp; Flying Spaghetti Monster values - as far as I am aware they all support looking after the sick over looking after the wallets of the sick.

I did an interview at a place in 2012 when I was due for a contract renew. They were rebuilding their stable ASP.Net/SQL Server stack in Mongo and Scala because they were buzzwords of the hour. Well they were trying to. Apparently Mongo didn't have the consistency or reliability guarantees the marketing promised and they didn't understand that the document model didn't fit the data model very well due to massively complex aggregates with random query requirements. 

Interviewed again about 3 months ago and they're still using ASP.Net/SQL Server and the team got booted after pissing about £200k up the wall on training and bad recruitments. Turned down the contract because they'd hired a new team that was convinced that the entire product's ills could be resolved with Riak and F# now... 

Sigh. So it was management fail. Some companies have this model:

1. Develop an opinion on what they should do that is flawed.
2. Hire people (usually hipsters) to build it.
3. Fail miserably and blame the people.
4. Think up another crackpot plan.

The crucial feature of indirect democracy is the perception of representation,
the collective trust in shared aims and expectations that allows the
people to put their destiny in the hands of another, safe in the
knowledge that even if ‘their’ man doesn’t get the job then the other
guy will still be looking after their best interests.

The manner in which this trust is built is the knowledge that you and
‘he’ have a history of cooperation, and that your respective families
likewise have a shared social and cultural history of cooperation, all
of which allows you to trust that when adversity strikes ‘he’ will act
in a predictable and acceptable way.

There are many varieties of trust networks including religion and
ideology, but we neither live in an authoritarian theocracy or a
communist dictatorship, and thus the most relevant network of trust in

er.. yeah.. where are you?

With even a small number of people willing to die for the cause (say a dozen) it would be so easy to plan plan and carry out a prolonged campaign of terror, even if you don't have access to guns or explosives; in fact those would be a liability when there are other options available (I won't go into the details because even though it's so amazingly simple, I've never heard of the things which occurred to me being used anywhere so I don't want to put them out there).

This leads me to two conclusions:

* Thus far there haven't been very many potential terrorists

* And/or those potential terrorists have been incredibly stupid

However: with a handful of people having gone to Syria, we do now have the potential for non-stupid terrorists showing up here at some point, and knowing each other on their return.

That is what worries me and I one Tory policy I actually agree with is to arrest them if they do return and then deport them or imprison them (depending on their citizenship status).

The BBC hadn't even bothered reading the transcript of the [blogger's interview](http://www.the-latest.com/blacks-should-go-back-home-if-they-dont-mayor) from which this false allegation came.

Later, when the BBC realised the blogger (Marc Wadsworth) was himself a supremacist racist making clearly false allegations they barely apologised and the damage was already done.

* Markovic: 20
* Sterling: 20
* Moreno: 22
* Manquillo: 20
* Can: 20
* Flanagan: 22

That's seven players who are under 23 who get regular playing time in our first team side.

Then make the argument that most footballers don't start entering their so-called 'prime' until they are 25 or 26. Now you start to see how exciting the future can be.

Now, I also subscribe to the theory from Tomkins Times that suggests if 50% of transfers work out (i.e. consistently in the first team) then that can be considered a success.

So, if only 3 or 4 players (say, Coutinho, Sterling, Can, Flanagan) from my list become at the very least regulars in the first team in the next season or two or three, well, that would be more than alright with me.

Consider a venn diagram with one circle inside another. The inner circle is the plan always. Sometimes contigency exceeds the scope of the outside circle. Also the scope of the outside circle is sometimes budget and if it is too large then it will never be started.

A real life example: changing the shock absorber on my car the other day. According to the service manual (the plan) I needed a 19mm and 21mm socket, take wheel off, lift axle 50mm, undo nuts, slide shock off with bushes, put new shock back on, redo nuts with threadlock to a defined torque, wheel on, bob = uncle.

Reality: take wheel off, realise bottom nut is siezed, spray with WD40, leave for 30 minutes, get the breaker bar out and the 21mm socket, crank it off, remove the remains of the bushes with a wire brush, do the same for the top bolt, argue with the neighbour for 5 minutes over whether or not I should be doing this on my drive (I should), degrease bolts and nuts, attach new shock, put threadlock on the nuts, tighten to torque specified and finally (as this wasn't mentioned in the instructions and/or plan) repeat for the other side.

Also I had to apply for a purchase order for WD40, degreaser and a breaker bar to the non-time-deterministic finance department (the wife).

So despite planning, oversight and technical competence, precision is unlikely on any complex system and that wasn't even a complex one. Expect non-determinism.

You must be dentally fit before ortho and an orthodontist will require the dentist to make sure this is so. Also 9 times out of 10 ortho requires some teeth taken out which an orthodontist again won't do and would ask your dentist to do so. 

Also if it is just a simple job to get your teeth in line (I don't know how they look now) you can go for adult orthodontics that a dentist can do for you. It's usually cheaper and quicker than conventional orthodontics and more discreet. For example I had a system called 6month smiles and it's like fixed braces but it is all white so less noticeable to people and as the name suggests takes on average 6 months.

My understanding is that actually that money is irrelevant to this deal. 

Our sanctions have allowed us to have a net spend of £49m for the season, and after spending £50m, and raising about £25m through player sales, we are left with £24m to spend before falling foul of the limit. 

Given we are almost definitely selling Nastasic, supposedly for £10m, spending £30m on Bony would leave us with a net spend of £45m - comfortably under the cap without even considering the Negredo money. 

As a summary - 

Bought: Caballero (£4.4m), Fernando (£12m), Zuculini (£1.5m), Mangala (£32m) and Bony (£28m). __Total Spent__ = __£77.9m__

Sold: Javi Garcia (£13m), Jack Rodwell (£10m), Huws (?m), Barry (£2m), Rusnak (600k) and _Nastasic_ (£10m). __Total Raised__ = __£35.6m__

Total Net spend = __£42.3m__. Well under the cap, not including the money due for Negredo in the summer.

Rent prices - I believe Birminghams rent prices are slightly higher than Manchesters, but not by that much. Also some of the areas just outside of Birmingham in Sandwell and Dudley are cheaper than in Birmingham itself. 

Cost of shopping, food, bills, clothes etc - Utility bills can be quite costly (some student type rental places include those in the rent costs though) and bus fares are getting pricey but there are plenty of cheap options when it comes to food and clothes.

As such, it'd be better for the environment if low UK energy prices cause the plant to come to the UK.

They'd be cheaper and easier to participate in, so anyone actually interested in democratic accountability should support them. Unfortunately, since the Tory leadership actually just wants to abolish the right to strike without actualy doing so, they won't introduce online ballotting.

I'd argue the problem is a centralised economic model, based on services (finance being the largest contributor) which cannot benefit the country as a whole. This has always been an issue since the 1980s and Thatcher's war on industrial/labour jobs in favour of modern business. The population was never ""re-educated"" and over time there is less demand for non-skill/semi-skill manual labour. What jobs do exist are being heavily contested by no/low/semi skilled immigrants who are happy to accept a lower wage.

One policy which I did agree with from the recent coalition is the idea of free schools. Despite it's spectacular failure the concept is a good one. I think this concept should be adopted economically (as well as educationally) and allow local areas more authority to condition tailored education and jobs. For example the North East is predominately industrial and the education and training should focus heavy on this.

The reason however that people are complaining is not that we HATE Nolan but rather that he isn't good enough to play for the club as a starter and embodies all the negative attributes of the long ball game that Big Sam deploys. Kevin Nolan must be comfortable playing the way that Big Sam wanted as he has followed him around at so many clubs.

With West Ham wanting to play a more positive attacking game, the sight of Kevin Nolan on the pitch leaves a somewhat bitter taste in the mouth as he is too old and too immobile to actually play the quick flowing game that we played when he wasn't in the team earlier in the season when we went on a nice winning run.

To give you some numbers on this: any one job may receive dozens of applicants. Of those, not all will be appropriate. Many applicants won't even have the necessary skills for the role on their CV or in their work history. 

Now consider that this one role is not the only role a recruiter works on - they might have dozens of jobs on too. 

Now work out how many people overall that recruiter might have to work through, *plus* speaking to companies, arranging interviews / feedback / job offers / issues, *plus* searching actively on job boards etc.

null,false,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,null,"The difficulty comes with the need for 2 different and incompatible signalling systems. This was recognised quite early, and the signalling vendors have been working on integrating these for a good few years - but for safety critical systems like this, development is very slow.

The outer parts of crossrail use the EU mandated ETCS (European Train Control System) level 2 system. The signalling centre works in much the same way to a conventional signalling system, the track is divided into sections (or blocks), and when a train enters a block, the signalling excludes any other trains from entering the same block. However, in this system, there are no track-side signals. Instead, the signalling centre sends out signal indications to trains over a 3G network. There are trackside transponders at key locations which allow the train to know where it is, and when it passes one, it sends an ""Train XXX is at beacon YYY"" message over 3G to the signalling centre, which then works out which block the train is entering, setting the signalling appropriately.

The problem with this system, is that it fails on busy metro lines, because the fixed track ""blocks"" waste too much space between trains. Fully electronic lines on the London underground (e.g. Victoria line, Jubilee line) and DLR, often use ""moving block"" approaches - typically known as CBTC (Communications based train control). In this case, the train determines its precise position (within a few meters) by a combination of trackside beacons, wheel rotation counters, GPS, etc. It also calculates its breaking distance based upon current speed, loading, weather conditions, etc. The precise position and breaking distance are transmitted to the signalling centre, and the signalling centre controls the train separation so that it is as close as feasible to the braking distance.

The problem has come at the boundary of the two systems. How do you get the two incompatible signalling systems from different vendors to talk to each other and allow trains to pass from one to the other, without serious degradation at the changeover point. How is it dealt with in the train when the two signalling systems give discordant indications to the driver and train control computer? Then there are the more complicated degradation modes - each individual signalling system has a series of ""failure modes"" depending on the severity of the breakdown. What happens when the different systems fail in different ways, and how does this affect the changeover point?

This interfacing has long been a challenge with CBTC technology; for example, moving block signalling through CBTC was originally selected by railtrack for the WCML. This was a hopeless failure, because CBTC had never been tested on such a complex line, with so many interfaces to conventional signalling systems, and at the time, no one even knew how to approach such a complex project. It didn't stop consultants burning through £billions in feasibility studies and custom R&amp;D work for railtrack to try to get this to work.",null,0,null,1420980930,null,0,false,0,cnlf19t,null,t3_2s1mpg,null,t1_cnlf19t,null,t3_2s1mpg,null,null,null,1424938910,null,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18,null

There are also ""specials"" splashed in between things here and there. The general rule is to watch things in the order they were released. You can use wikipedia (others have linked the relevant page)

So, just watch them in chronological order, although you don't have to watch the classics first. You can start at 2005 instead. In fact I have recently started watching from 1963, and sometimes it becomes quite boring to sit through. I don't know why I'm doing it...

Besides, the idea that drone operators who track targets for hours using reconnaissance and sources would blindly fire expensive PGMs at cattle herders and farmers just gives the idea of mustache-twirling villains. If we sent in Special Forces that would be worse, as there lives would be on the line and aerial support would be randomly blowing up stuff (remember the case of Drones killing Pakistani soldiers?

The issue is that 'some' people in the NHS are still living and working a Monday to Friday 9-5 mentality, however the NHS is clearly in need of a 24/7 mentality, for example how many operations could be completed on a Sat/Sun? yes these still go ahead, but at a 33% cost increase over Monday to Friday?

Instead consultants should be required to work 7 days a week, with two days off built into those 7, not exceeding more than 11 days straight (in line with Working Time Directive)

Therefore contracts should be amended (after consultation) and those nurses who agree to work BAU weekends should find their basic pay increased to reflect this, those who refuse should find that they no longer attract weekend premiums.

Most businesses I have worked in (that operate 7 days weeks) have rarely offered increase in wages for Overtime, if you need to be bringing in 2 nurses for OT to cover the same shifts at weekends, the it makes economical sense to employ 2 nurses to fill those as BAU shifts and save the wage bill.

null,false,Chlorophilia,null,null,null,"Firstly, to claim that ""they don't pollute or produce any CO2"" is just plain wrong. I'm not entirely sure where you think the uranium for the reactors comes from, but it comes from massive mining operations which are some of the most environmentally destructive of the planet. This, combined with the enrichment process and shipping (since most of our uranium comes from places like Australia) already adds a sizeable carbon footprint before you've even got the reactor.

The reactors themselves require an absolutely enormous amount of concrete, which is one of the most carbon-intensive materials in existence. If you put all of this together with the relatively short lifespan of nuclear power plants in comparison with their construction and decommissioning process,  it's absolutely impossible to claim that nuclear energy is ""green"". Yes, it's substantially less harmful than fossil fuel alternatives but it isn't ""green"" and it certainly is nowhere near carbon neutral. 

Adding to that, nuclear energy is the frontispiece of the ""top-down"" energy movement, heralded by corporations, the total opposite of the ""bottom-up"", locally and cooperative-owned energy movements (such as those that are resulting in massive successes for renewables in countries like the Netherlands and Germany). I was very much pro-nuclear until recently, when I realised that not only is a transition to 100% renewables possible (politically difficult, but possible), but industries like the nuclear industry (along with the fossil fuel industry) are some of the biggest obstacles to this. Naomi Klein makes an excellent case for this in 'This Changes Everything'. If you genuinely want to have an environmentally friendly society, the only way forward is to advocate locally owned renewables projects that directly support local people and that feed into local economies. Nuclear energy is a red herring. I'd rather have nuclear than fossil fuels, but I'd rather have renewables than nuclear - and the idea that renewables cannot provide us with our energy needs is a myth that has been proven wrong by real-world examples.",null,0,null,1420985857,null,0,false,0,cnlg9ek,null,t3_2rme17,null,t1_cnlg9ek,null,t1_cnhfj3y,null,null,null,1424938338,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Second of all I don't think we lost to CP because of a lack of proper CMs. Well not entirely anyway. Poor play by our central pivot, and even poorer refereeing aside, I think the main reason we lost is because we switched off. We were our 'typical Tottenham' selves - play brilliant football one week, think the memory of it is enough to last for a while, then promptly lose the next game.

It's something we've seen happen time and time again. Buying new players (an already difficult thing to do in January) can only do so much. At the end of the day our mentality needs to change. The number of times I've heard Poch talk about it, leaves me confident that it's something that's being worked on.

Having said that I really don't care where we finish this season personally. Obviously I would be happy if we did get T4 and/or a cup win. However I would consider this season a success if we sorted out our scouting system, reemphasized HG player development and the importance of our youth system, and most importantly, buried the 'typical Tottenham' mentality once and for all.

I see nothing wrong in deporting foreign born hate preachers, jihadis and their families; this argument has nothing to do with tolerance, but rather self preservation.

Yes, there seems to be a problem with islam, and we should be brave enough to look at it objectively, without making hysteric accusations and without retorting to cheap nazi jibes. Every time an islamist atrocity pops up in the news we're quick to say ad nauseatum that its not representative of islam - it is a religion of peace after all. We probably wouldn't have to repeat it so often if we believed it.

One cannot simply equate the secular laws and values of the British state or say, the French republic with a medieval system of belief, Islam, which is almost invariably at odds with them for all the bad reasons.

null,false,chimpyang,null,null,null,"Multiple problems that have been simmering for a while now:

1. Decreased hospital bed capacity - we've lost about 10,000 beds in England since 2010 (see : [Spreadsheet from NHS England](http://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/04/Beds-Timeseries-2010-11-onwards-Q2-2014-15.xls) - its been an ongoing trend before that as well.

2. Larger elderly population with more co-morbidities than before.  Multiple complex medical problems are difficult to fix and increasing frailty means that they are more likely to need social input - hospitals cannot simply dump people back at home if there is a concern that they will be unsafe in their home situations.

3.  Linked to the above - we (as individuals) seem to do less care for our elderly relatives than before - I don't have proof of this - but, people tend to move away from family for work and retirement - giving that all up to look after ill relatives is rarer.  Sadly - Granny/Grandad - dumping is a thing - and you're a massive cunt if you drop your relative off at hospital because you want a quiet christmas, or to go on holiday - respite care exists for a reason.

4. Overburdened (and underfunded) social services - 2+3 often means that elderly patients often need care/residential/nursing/EMI homes - and caseworkers are being overloaded by the demand coming from hospitals and places in the community are hard to come by - esp. over the Christmas period, where everything winds down a bit (well deserved as well) Hospitals seem to have more difficulty in discharging patients - as arranging for social care is more difficult.

5. Full wards means that there is a clogging of patient flow - people that do need to come into hospital end up waiting for a ward bed down in A&amp;E - which then blocks the A&amp;E spaces for patients who have presented to A&amp;E, thus the whole thing grinds to a halt.  I.e. the hospital becomes hugely constipated.  **This is the mostly ignored reason for why A&amp;E has suffered - it's the canary in the mine for the rest of the hospital**

6.  The important jobs have become incredibly unattractive - I can't grasp why anyone would want a career in GP/A&amp;E - many people talk of early retirement and friends of mine in FY2 rotations in GP are actively being discouraged by GP partners from going into GP given the shit (mostly non-medical) that comes with the job.  I can't speak for nurses, but those that I have kept in contact with from FY1 say that they are looking for non-ward jobs ASAP now.

Its essentially a systems failure in both health and social care.

null,false,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,null,"There are many factors:

1. NHS funding has been increased year-on-year, but the rate of increase has not kept up with increasing demand, and in recent years it has not kept up with inflation.

2. The population in the UK is growing faster than expected due mainly to high levels of immigration. During the 90s and early 00s, population growth in the UK was about 0.3% per year. During the late 00s and early 10s, this rose to nearly 0.9% per year. This has resulted in about 5% demand growth which has not been matched by increased funding.

3. The population is older, so there are more old people with complicated combinations of multiple health problems which may require hospital care, and may require hospital care for longer and on a more frequent basis.

4. Excessive demand on social care. More frail elderly people means more demand for in-home care, or residential care. There are frequently delays in having social care arranged, leading to ""bed blocking"" where an elderly person comes into hospital with a medical problem, but cannot return home once treated, because they would not be safe there until appropriate arrangements can be made by social services.

5. Changes to the GP contract mean that there has been a reduction to out of hours GP provision. This may mean that minor problems occurring outside of M-F 9-5 require an A&amp;E visit.

6. Difficulty with recruiting new GPs. It is proving impossible to recruit new trainees to GP training schemes. Concerns over massive cuts in pay for new starters and uncertainty about renegotiation of contracts has scared doctors away from careers as a GP. This has resulted in a serious shortage of GPs and great difficulty in securing an appointment.

7. Replacement of the NHS direct service with the cheaper 111 service. Instead of using trained nurses to answer phones and give advice, 111 uses non-medical call handlers following a strict script which has resulted in an increase in advice to go to A&amp;E.",null,0,null,1420990989,null,0,false,0,cnli09z,null,t3_2s2985,null,t1_cnli09z,null,t3_2s2985,null,null,null,1424937523,null,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12,null

It's a very fine line at times. 

In general, free speech, like all fundamental rights (including the right to life), is not taken to be absolute. Very very few can logically argue that it should be, considering that, at the very least, the civil law (e.g. defamation) places *some* limits on speech. The more intense debate takes place in the context of using the criminal law, and different countries resolve the tensions differently and through different combinations of regulation by law, social/cultural norms, procedures etc. 

In a nutshell, matters of free speech turn immensely on context. The context can be cultural, historical, socio-economic, and even just practical, but essentially it's about consideration of the time and the place, both on the macro level as well as the micro level. As you might imagine it is very difficult to give absolutely concrete definitions of these concepts in advance, particularly because defining them is an ongoing process. 

In short, in the UK people are *not* technically arrested for the opinions they hold. They are arrested for the manner and context of the opinions they are flagrantly expressing. The lines can be very blurry though, so it's important for the debate to be continuous and as *open as possible without crossing into violence.* Unfortunately it is one of those debates that in practice has the propensity to produce collateral damage.

There's a good comparison of the approaches of the US and UK on this [here.](http://www.lawthink.co.uk/2011/03/uk-free-speech-vs-us-free-speech-more-speech-not-always-the-solution/)

* You feel well enough to work and can't afford to take time off, but you feel your condition could worsen.

null,false,agentdcf,flair8,,null,"I definitely agree with your points, and I'd add that if we look at [the minutes played over the past two months or so](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/2r2qln/fatigue_revisited_minutes_played_in_the_last/), our reliance on Kane and Eriksen to attack, Fazio and Vertonghen to defend, and Mason and Bentaleb to keep the team ticking is even more evident. So, we're clearly thin in those three areas and desperate for cover. Losing Mason and Bentaleb, in my view, is as damaging to us as losing either Kane &amp; Eriksen or Fazio &amp; Vertonghen. Those three pairings are the spine of the team right now (Lloris is, of course, the heart). 

I also agree that finding players to slot in is easier said than done. One point that I've been thinking about and that I think is worth considering concerns players' attitudes and scouting. *Any* player we acquire has to be capable of earning a spot in the squad, and that means they must be exceptional at training and at accepting and carrying out a particular role. Obviously, as you say, raw talent isn't enough to get it done, or else we'd see guys like Adebayor playing. So, in addition to the talent level and ability to fill a role in a match, we have additional requirements of any player we acquire: he must work very hard in training and he must be willing and able to follow instructions within the team's structure. 

Here, I suspect, is an aspect of our scouting that might be deficient. Unless you're going to go and interview the player himself, his present and former coaches, his teammates, etc., it's not easy to get good intelligence on a player's attitude. It's labor-intensive, something that watching endless video will not necessarily reveal and yet something that is vital to any player we acquire. The acquisition of Mitchell suggests strongly that the club has identified weaknesses in scouting and player assessment as an underlying, structural problem, but it's not something that can be fixed immediately. Even if we could get a staff of new or somehow revitalized scouts in place instantly, a new database of video and other information, etc., it still takes time to collect the information you really need on players. 

This kind of information is particularly relevant for Pochettino, moreso than for our previous coaches (I can see the argument that it's related to the very mixed results of Baldini's acquisitions for AVB, but that's another matter).  Assessing players by their in-game performance and talent is insufficient now--we need to know how they'll operate in the squad when they're NOT playing in matches, because that's how Pochettino operates. And, we could sit here and talk about the usual suspects for, say, striker--Benteke, Bony, whoever, the same people we're always talking about--but to me, those names almost don't matter because it's unclear to me that those players would train and follow Pochettino's instructions enough to get in the squad. I'm not saying those guys are bad at training or have poor attitudes or anything, just that we don't really know. 

If we are indeed deficient in this area, as I suspect, then I can imagine a January window in which we make very few moves, despite the fact that our areas of need are manifest: players who can support and rotate with Eriksen &amp; Kane, Mason &amp; Bentaleb, and Fazio &amp; Vertonghen. I think we'll see us try to acquire players whom Pochettino knows and trusts--Moreno at centreback, for example, or Schneiderlin--but that's a quite limited list of players, not all of whom will be available to us at prices that make sense, or even at all. 

So, unhappily, I think we might just see the glimmer of promise in this season that has shone through in the past month dim and flicker out. We're going to struggle without Mason and (especially) Bentaleb in the next run of matches, as much as if we were without other members of our spine. And, honestly, that's okay. The goal of this season must be to identify our real strengths and weaknesses, and move toward addressing them in the long term.

Hard  for me to say either way if I'm honest. I've been through France and Spain and have had some horrific experiences with motorists there. Perhaps that's just my bad luck - I don't know how we compare overall with either country. 

I do agree that our infrastructure is less kind to cyclists for instance than some European countries. I'm in favour of a change there. 

The trouble is that *some* cyclists (not all) go on to blame motorists for this and don't realise that aggressive as motorists can be - so too can pedestrians and cyclists. It's kind of a self defeating cycle. 

Definitely we need infrastructure improvements - but further education for *all* road users and travellers would also be useful. We teach people the basic rules of driving - no rule to cycling or walking - but nothing in depth about how they interact. There's no respect taught (ideally we wouldn't need to - but I think we do).

The difficulty was that they didn't have medical staff, and therefore were unable to deal with anything other than the most minor problems. For example, it was common for a WIC to be staffed by a nurse, who would not be able to prescribe medications.

So, when the child turns up who has a bit of a chest infection and needs a short course of antibiotics, they can't do it - they have to refer on to a GP, or to A&amp;E or to the on-call doctor at a local hospital without A&amp;E. 

When I worked as a junior at a specialist hospital (no A&amp;E), a WIC was installed on the site. It rapidly became known as the ""walk through centre"" among the hospital staff, because a significant number of cases were simply dumped on the hospital, which had no real provision to deal with them.  It was hailed as a great success because it was cheaper than providing an on-site GP, but that's because all the hidden costs absorbed by the hospital - paperwork, increased work load for nursing staff, pharmacy, doctors, etc. was all hidden.

* The population is aging, but this is only part of the issue... Bed capacity has fallen whilst the population has increased massively due to immigration and demographic changes. Additionally over the last 10 years when hospitals have been rebuilt they were told to do it with **fewer** beds... on the logic that more services would move to the community or to same-day-discharge procedures... however this shift in services has been mitigated by the increase in demand. 

* Patients are living longer. They aren't just living longer either - they are living with conditions that 10-15 years ago would have killed them in a much earlier stage of disease progression. We are seeing lots of people with complex co-morbidities as a result of long term conditions like Diabetes and High blood pressure. In the case of diabetes this includes things like blindness, severe wound ulcers, amputations etc. There are increasingly large numbers of cancer survivors who are often left requiring extensive follow-up from things like bowel resections/stomas, complications from chemotherapy and radiotherapy etc.

* Antibiotics are less effective than they used to be. Resistant strains of bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus (human skin colonisers) and clostridium difficile (human gut bacteria) now exist or spontaneously mutate in healthcare facilities not just in the UK but around the world. Problems here are exacerbated by high bed occupancy rates due to the above points. Hygiene isn't as big a cause as it is made out to be but is also a contributory factor. This means patients are staying longer in hospital due to complications from antibiotic resistant infections.

* Austerity... probably overstated in the cause of the current issues, austerity isn't the cause of these problems but it is part of the problem with addressing them. In particular austerity has meant social care budgets have been cut from local councils own budgets. This means elderly patients are often ""bed blocked""/stuck in hospital whilst they are medically fit to go home simply because there are no carers to go in and look after them. 

* There actually has been a flu outbreak this year... there is every year around winter time which is when the virus tends to have outbreaks as the weather gets colder. This year has been particularly bad because the annual flu vaccination which is produced each year and given to high risk people (pregnant/have diabetes etc.) does not provide cover against the most prevalent strain we have seen this year (which is called Influenza A H3). This means more people have been hospitalized with flu, and they are often people with complex problems (which contributed to them catching it) and they then need advanced care in places like Intensive Care or a High Dependency Unit, which clogs up the system. 

* Imagine rock bottom. Then imagine 50 feet of concrete backfill and another 25 feet of horse shit. That is where morale in the NHS is. Remember, most workers in the NHS have seen their comparable pay cut by about 15% over the last 4 years. That isn't small change. For a typical middle grade hospital doctor on £40k that means they are effectively taking home about £5k less than they would have been before the crash. At the same time they've seen their pension contributions go up further cutting into their take home salary.

The bottom line is all the things you will be reading about - like 7 day working, better GP access etc. are all ideas to try and **boost capacity** (7 day working is a bit like opening the factory at night, it's simply a way of getting more people through the door). The NHS is suffering because it doesn't have the capacity in its current form to deliver what is being asked of it. Right now there is some scope to absorb that by delaying elective/planned procedures... but that in itself is only delaying the inevitable ""catch up"" that will have to be played later. The brutal reality is its only January, things will probably get much worse... and the things that have made this year bad aren't going to change next year. We can probably expect a protracted period of several years (maybe a decade plus) of worsening statistics. Many in the NHS feel this is partly a deliberate move by the Tories to set the stage for privatization under the guise of ""improvement/modernization"" in baby steps. Unfortunately, a lot of people don't think labours ""throw a bit more money at it"" solution is particularly effective either.  

The reality is healthcare is becoming more expensive and the people that need it most (the elderly) did not pay enough into the system. What upsets me is to see so many young people campaign for the NHS when the likelyhood is they will not receive the same care their parents did... at least not for the same price. Effectively more money needs to go into the system (which is already one of the most cost efficient in the world... the scope for efficiency savings probably isn't as big as the government hopes). Ultimately we have to decide as a nation who pays, and how they pay for it. That is why neither Labour nor the Tories really have the issue by the balls.

The reason I stated carefully privatizing it could be an option is because it could work. It doesn't have to be like the American system where you receive bills in the thousands. It could work with health insurance, where everyone pays a fixed amount each year for their insurance and then they can use the services if they have that. If they choose not to have insurance then they have to pay the full bills. You could get insurance through your jobs or through social welfare. There could be a million opportunities to do something as such and it doesn't have to be ""everyone pays extortionate bills and doctors ramp up prices and add non necessary services to get more money"".

HS2 isn't supposed to help towns and communities across the very limited part of the UK it will actually reach.

It's supposed to make it easier for people living there to get to London, to enhance London's ability to swallow up all and sundry.
Basically, it's a shame whereby Birmingham and maybe Manchester too, get to become commuter towns for London.

Instead of their economies thriving and prospering, Govt. would like to see people getting to, investing and moving to London, so those places aren't  threat to it's supremacy.  HS2 makes that goal easier.

Of course, there is a minor reciprocal effect; people who have a business in Birmingham but work in London will be more likely to invest there as well, but primarily, it's about making the black hole in London a little bit stronger.",null,0,null,1420994755,null,0,false,0,cnljmdt,null,t3_2s22d1,null,t1_cnljmdt,null,t1_cnlhv0j,null,null,null,1424936770,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

* People who don't have any Java or C#! 

Let's go with Java for instance. I get a not-ignorable number of people applying for Java work who have never used Java before. They may have read a textbook - and are adamant that they can do it - but that's it. 

Unfortunately if the companies we're recruiting for need someone with Java experience - we have to deliver. I appreciate that it's easy to switch between some development languages but that's not a call *we* have the power to make. We've already asked the client if they'll take someone from another development background - if they say no - that's it. 

* Location. 

We get a fairly sizeable number of overseas applicants and generally companies won't want to fund and sponsor someone coming from Bangalore for their role. Also - unfortunately - the quality of international developers is not always reliable. 

Many companies have also been 'burned' by applicants who accepted jobs with them - then failed to start because they didn't want to relocate after all or there was some issue (even moving within the UK).

* Salary. 

We advertise a role up to £40k. We speak to someone who looks good and they won't take less than £50k - but thought they'd ask the question. 

Fine, but we've already asked our client their maximum and explored this. It's another thing we can't magically change. 

* Visa holders. 

Some companies can't or won't sponsor visa holders to work for them. Some legally can't because of the kind of work they do (there are restrictions).

Spurs and Poch it seems don't prefer to play natural DM anymore and thats my guess as to why he is left out.

As to yesterday, Dembele was mostly anonymous. Almost every time we tried to pass out of defense the ball would go to Benji and Dembele would would have found a Palace guy to mark him. Eriksen had to come back into midfield and try to start us forward due to this.

His passing may be lacking but it is not aweful as some make it out to be. I think Benji would do well beside a Mason or a more adventurous Bentaleb.

Our best CM pairing this season has been Bentaleb and Mason. Both academy graduates with less than a year of prem experience between them. You mean to tell me they have more quality than Dembele (a PL vet) and Stambouli (a Ligue 1 winner)? Impossible.

No what happened was exactly the result of complacency. Dembele was barely pressing and often would take too long to get back into position. Stambouli was unnecessarily reckless, even before the penalty. Both were guilty of switching off which is exactly why Poch trusts our youth - because they have less of a tendency to wander off in games and actually listen to instructions.

So far this season we've been lucky to have Kane spur us on - not just with his goals but his drive and energy. However yesterday he was barely involved and we suffered for it.  I mean sure we passed the ball around nicely and managed to look a bit interested with a couple of drives forward, but otherwise we were quite simply toothless. We barely looked interested and CP made us pay for it. I don't know about you but to me that only points to complacency.

The fact is we cannot keep depending on one player to get us going. We did it with Bale and now we're doing it with Kane. The team needs to realize that every game counts. The players need to realize that they can't wait for their teammates to push themselves on.

dzeko is strong but doesnt have the pace nor the consistent touch to do so. To make it worse, he had just enough skill that occasionally he could do it, making him think he can always do it. half the time it would be better for dzeko to just go forward and let aguero/silva bring it up.

Jove can do this and is suited best for this type of play. the problem then for him is scoring, so unless he shapes up and improves over the rest of the season, there is a good chance he leaves in the summer (i hope a loan deal non-permanent, but sale is more likely).

The alternative would be that one of you offers to take responsibility for the whole rent, and the landlord allows you to sublet. The problem is there though that if I shared a £1,400 flat in London I could afford it split but literally no way could I afford it on my own, so you're still a risk.

If you can afford the place on your own I'd offer to rent it out on your own and the Landlord agree that you can rent one of the rooms out to someone you know.

null,false,agentdcf,flair8,,null,"&gt; Our best CM pairing this season has been Bentaleb and Mason. Both academy graduates with less than a year of prem experience between them. You mean to tell me they have more quality than Dembele (a PL vet) and Stambouli (a Ligue 1 winner)? Impossible.

&gt; No what happened was exactly the result of complacency. Dembele was barely pressing and often would take too long to get back into position. Stambouli was unnecessarily reckless, even before the penalty. Both were guilty of switching off which is exactly why Poch trusts our youth - because they have less of a tendency to wander off in games and actually listen to instructions.

Rather than assessing an abstract characteristic like ""quality,"" I think the far more important thing that both you and /u/smokey815 point out is that Bentaleb and Mason are more effective at Spurs, right now. However much talent Dembele has, whatever Stambouli's history of success is, Mason and Bentaleb in the lineup give us a much better chance to win. 

We can say it's ""complacency"" but that essentially implies that if Dembele or Stambouli *really wanted to*, then they could in fact be better. It's a bit of stretch to just assume that they weren't trying very hard, or that they just didn't want to win very much. No, whatever it is, it's clear that they're just not as effective.

And, when you say that we ""barely looked interested,"" what I saw is that we had a pair of midfielders in Dembele and Stambouli who just do not have the vision and passing skills necessary to open up the middle of the pitch and connect the defense with the attack. We typically move the ball quickly up the pitch with three, four, or five quick passes, getting the ball to our attacking players before the defense is set, and giving guys like Eriksen, Kane, and Chadli room to operate in. Mason, especially, is good at moving the ball forward like that, and indeed moving himself into spaces that drag other players out of position and create opportunities for the rest of the team. Dembele and Stambouli don't do that, and I doubt it's a lack of interest, as though they cannot be bothered. I think it's ability. Now, we might say that Dembele has more ""quality"" than Bentaleb or Mason in that he can make these lovely gliding runs or dribble past players or whatever, but the bottom line is that whatever his quality, he's not effective.

They are also closing down A&amp;Es across the country. I live in the borough of Lewisham in London and there was a recent campaign to stop our local hospitals A&amp;E being closed, it was successful but close. If the Government had won there would be one A&amp;E in a nearby borough which would have had to deal with 750,000 patients. Obviously, closing A&amp;Es puts pressure on others. Im not the most informed on this topic even though i think it is really important, so if you want more information id say check out those links. My view is that the Conservative Government, motivated in part by their right-wing ideology, have instigated the biggest top down reorganisation in the history of the NHS and are seeking to save tens of billions by cutting NHS providers and bringing in private healthcare, despite all the evidence which shows how terrible this would be. Privatisation ultimately means profit for some, and if you look at how many politicians are also on the board of private healthcare companies, or have some other involvement with private healthcare companies, you would be shocked. Seriously, in my mind its no different to corruption. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the British media doesnt seem very interested in seriously addressing this issue and are happy to keep to the governments line.

I liked what I saw from Elia. I've seen him play for Bremen before and was really less than impressed, but today he looked a different player in the effort department. He's always been good at taking players on one on one or turning and burning a defender like he did to Blackett (Jones?), but I saw some actual effort to be involved defensively and in the buildup today that I never saw watching him play for Bremen. He doesn't, and has never had any end product, but neither does Mane or JWP really, so I think we can make it work. He's only on loan, and is a bit of an off the field basket case, but as long as we can keep him off the roads and on the pitch putting a shift in, I think he has something to offer.

2. Pick up a striker who can finish. Doesn't have to be someone for the long-term, since we're getting Origi in the summer and I think we'll have better options in the summer. Hell, it we could find someone on loan, I think it'd be worth it. I've see the rumors about Higauin. I think he'd be fine, if Sturridge is actually coming back this time. He isn't a like-for-like replacement but can at least put the ball in the back of the net.

3. Finish up sale of Assaidi

4. Get a keeper. Whether we get a keeper on loan (Ter Stegen) until we can get a permanent option in summer or pick up a better back-up until we can get a better starter in summer, we have to do something this window.

5. If there's any money left at this point, work on finding a Gerrard replacement. Otherwise, this can wait until summer because we still have Gerrard.

However, off peak means you can't go during the hour they say - so Virgin off peak is: Off-Peak

(Mon-Fri) Not valid for arrival into London before 11:30am
(Mon-Fri) Not valid for leaving London before 9:30am and between 3pm and 6:45pm
Valid on all trains at weekends and on public holidays.

So it is safe for you to get an off peak ticket as you will be arriving into London way past 11:30.

The Virgin train from Lime Street to London takes 2 hours I believe and so if you're cool with not having a reserved seat, then that's what you're in for (Personally, get to the station for 6:35 latest as those big trains often pull in wayyy before, it might be in the station at like 6:25 but they'll clean it so people can't get on yet usually, as long as you're there you can jump on fast and you will have a seat, I assure you.

The way the trains work in Lime Street is the unreserved seats are normally at the far end of the station, so when the train pulls in you want to be waiting further up (in the direction the train is going to leave, where the driver will be)

It always makes me laugh when I'm by myself stood up that far end of the platform and everyone is a massive crowd at one end, the train pulls up and they all realise they're at the reserved carriages so they walk up to my end and I have put my suitcase in a slot and got my flask out by that point :) Sorry, just rambling.

Anyway, so you can buy an offpeak without reserved but just make sure you can get to the station in good time, if you can't then you'll be standing mate - so take that into consideration.


Where are you booking your train through? I usually use http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/farefinder/search or just National Rail in particular and I have no problem reserving my seat. It must be an error on your part? But like I've said, if worse comes to the worse you can still do your journey - you have a ticket. You don't need to reserve a seat, you're not up shit creek, as long as you have a valid ticket you can go on the journey. (So beware with a ticket that says 'Permitted route: Manchester' and you travel on the train taking you south via Stockport, the conductor will charge you for a new ticket. The train got you where you needed but you weren't allowed to take that route. Also beware with the offpeak shit but if that's the time you're doing then you can buy an offpeak :) Saves money.

I know this is a hell of a lot of writing but I figured if a fellow Red is in a foreign land you may as well be given the adequate information :) Travel safe.",null,0,null,1420999567,null,0,false,0,cnlm1zt,null,t3_2s2pew,null,t1_cnlm1zt,null,t3_2s2pew,null,null,null,1424935606,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

I seriously doubt it will encourage businesses to move out of London to other parts of the UK.  If anything I think it will incentivise them to shut down regional offices, safe in the knowledge that if they need someone to go out to a regional unit, it's only an hour on the train...
In addition it will allow even more people from outside london to work in London - due to the massive cost of housing etc. in london, it will not encourage london-based employees to get jobs out of london, as they won't get paid the premium rates london-based roles pay due to london being expensive to live in.

This, like many UK govt. policies, is entirely focussed on London and it's needs.

That is putting aside the scottish element of this - that we are being asked to fund a ""national"" project that will not benefit scotland in any way whatsoever, and for which there are NO barnett consequentials, yet when we have a similarly big project in Scotland, it's classed as a ""local"" one by UK govt. and so money for it has to come out of the scottish budget.

Also 5 minutes of injury time what for? That's dumb...

Our back four are fantastic we have only conceded 14 goals and now we have 10 clean sheets! I really love us this season.

Also Gary Neville said morgan could play at any of the big teams and it was great to hear the presenter say yea well his team is third. We are third pretty unreal.

I think we've proved everyone wrong taking 7/9 points against Chelsea, Arsenal &amp; Man United.

Their *reason* for the closure was their inability to recruit doctors to staff the unit - and the consequent inability to ensure the safety of people entering A&amp;E. The local council, I've read, didn't actually read the fine print of the Trust's proposals, thus failed to grasp the closure was always on the cards. That's in the past. The trust's *now* about to implement a shift system change that penalises new starters with longer days, ignores the needs of staff with children, and then of course there's the nationwide talk of reducing costs by eliminating the unsocial hours enhancements at the same time as giving pitiful pay rises.

It's *almost* as if they're trying to make it unattractive to work anywhere but their headquarters, and outside the 9-5 day.

But what would I know, I see conspiracy theories *everywhere.* And get a bit ranty about it, sorry folks!

Speaking of daft theories, I've attended a couple of hospitals in recent times with both my daughters. Immigration is a valid factor, don't arbitrarily discount it.

Bernd Leno from Leverkusen.

Granted, the London Midland is a 5 hour trip with a switch in Birmingham but it was 1/4 the price of the Virgin off peak.

Sorry, we pretty much don't have passenger trains in southern USA (I know there's an Amtrak but never met anyone who has ever taken it), so all of this terminology is totally over my head.  

So for future reference, if I understand correctly, with an off peak ticket you have a guaranteed seat in that particular off peak train you booked on, you just can't reserve a particular seat?  I was worried that off peak was a first come first serve basis, so there would be a chance if they were busy (like after a football game), you wouldn't get a seat and you'd have to take a later train (or wait for the next day).

Most young people struggle to earn enough to afford the rising costs of housing, education, transport etc. and face a precarious labour market.

Yet given the time value of money - this reduced capacity to save earlier in life is having a massive effect on their total lifetime wealth and particularly their ability to retire.

Also larger mortgages and older first time buyers mean people will struggle to pay off their mortgage before retirement or will just rent their whole lives - meaning they will require a far larger income in retirement to cover housing costs and yet they have less retirement savings!

I think athletico madrid have shown that you can rise and compete against the bigger clubs without the same financial resources. I think for the next couple of years the priority will be competing with arsenal/tottenham for champions league spaces whilst united/chelsea/city buy more and stretch ahead, so it might take a few years. But I think when the group of players is in their prime, we'll be competing for the champions league. It is a bit of a gamble, and a little speculation. But when you have players like sterling, markovic, can who are 20. coutinho and moreno are 22, then you would be extremely unlucky not to generate a world class team.

No just books and articles I have read that are relevant; Kaku's work in particular might be of interest to you. The reason I 'parrot names' is reputability, I don't expect you to take my word, so I provide you with experts claims and theories, the same reason you reference published work. 

&gt;Human civilisation has to sort out its pollutant emissions and consumption of scarce and finite resources in order to continue your precious technological advance over the coming century.
 
The opposite can equally be argued “*necessity is the mother of invention*” I am not saying that Space based solar power will be the sole solution to the problems we face and you have outlined, but simply one of them.  

&gt;I think you take humanity's current level of technology and scientific knowledge as a given, and can't imagine any possibility that it might be lost.

Well yes I do, how is it going to be lost? Nuclear war seems to be the only crisis which is fast moving enough to cause such a situation.

In general you probably want to get in contact with the statutory regulator, the GPhC, their website is over at http://www.pharmacyregulation.org. You can make a formal comlaint about a pharmacist, pharmacy tech or a pharmaceutical business and they have the power to investigate and issue sanctions against the person or business. 

I would be wary about ""starting a campaign"" calling a business or individual corrupt, as it would be very difficult to prove in order to defend a deformation action against you. Corrupt is one of those words that act as a catch all for a persons character, such as calling someone a liar or a cheat that are all but indefensible in libel cases. Generally speaking, the courts draw a strong distinction between saying an action was corrupt (which is relatively defensible, if you have a grade A legal team and a fuckton of cash on hand for a long, drawn out court case), and saying that a person or business is corrupt. It is a subtle but important distinction, and if you feel you want to start a ""campaign"" to publicly shame a person or business, I would think very carefully about what you want to achieve and how much you are willing to risk and stick solely to the facts that you can prove, leaving judgement to the individual reader.

My counter example is that being a light skinned Indian, I'm often told I look Hispanic or Arabic. Hispanic is usually when I have very short hair, and Arabic now in my early 20s when I've started keeping some short facial hair. No one has told me I have a Hispanic or Arabic skin tone, but that's how my skin tone is being perceived in the context of my other features.

The point I'm making is essentially not all people of that skin tone are brazillian, but significant portions (though not all) of the Brazilian population are of the skin tone shared by fernandinho and Fernando and slightly by Kompany. People use knowledge that certain nationalities do have many people with a certain skin tone along with other features to make assumptions about a person's ethnicity. Skin tone is a major piece of the data people use to make that assumption.

Bitstamp are an exchange based in Slovenia.  Having said that, they clearly advertise on their about us page that they are Bitstamp Limited which is a Company registered in England and Wales.  A quick check at Companies House shows this company to be trading and their accounts are up to date.  They are certainly not dormant.

If you wish to go down the Stat Demand route or straight to Winding Up proceedings, you will need to be owed more than £750.00.  Serving a Stat Demand sometimes has an effect if the Company are looking to preserve their Company and they will either negotiate with you or pay in full.  The alternative is they will go to Court to have the Stat Demand set aside (within 18 days of being served at their Registered Office).  If they are successful, the Court will order that proceedings need to be issued in the County Court.

From my understanding, Bitstamp are ensuring no one actually loses out from the purported hack.  You would only be successful in Winding them up if you can prove they are insolvent.  It appears from my research they are not insolvent but I have no evidence either way to back this up save from what I have read in the past few days.

To answer your question:-

Just want an opinion on making statutory demand against bitstamp. Will this work if they decide to disappear for good?

The truth is, if a Company has no assets in the UK, you could simply be wasting your time.  All a Stat Demand entitles you to do is to issue Winding Up proceedings.  As this is a Company, you can go straight to Winding Up IF you have made a formal demand to Bitstamp to return whatever fiat/crypto they were holding on your behalf and they have not replied.

So, I do not think serving them with a Stat Demand is going to assist you particularly as they will be aware that you would have to issue proceedings for Winding Up and they can defend those in any event. The costs of Winding Up are not insignificant.  Further details of these fees are here:-

&gt;the failure of the market to insure against uncertainties
has created many social institutions in which the usual assumptions of
the market are to some extent contradicted. The medical profession is
only one example, though in many respects an extreme one. (Arrow, 1963)

As for living anywhere else in the world, no chance. We have universal healthcare here. Most people in this country appreciate what a godsend that is. Before the NHS you had to be rich or lucky to make it through life healthy. 

If we lose the NHS because of people like you, that's where we'll end up again. That might suit you but for almost everyone else, that would be massive social regress.

Dunno? The above comment might have been one I expanded, but I didn't remove anything.

&gt; because it was so crap

Oh! *Thank you so much* for taking the time to reply to this one, kind sir! So grateful, I am.

I'm not grasping at straws, rather I'm making the point that people are quick to be happily dismissive and throw their hands up: ""What a silly fucker?! What did she expect!"" when they don't know the first thing about it other than sketchy initial details.

You know what though - get this! I don't think she should have been on the road! But I'm not going to 'blame' her for being killed or make comments as to her 'silly' actions. That *is* a possibility, you know.

She's dead. She made a mistake - assuming she didn't want to die - yet so many people are dismissing it because obviously it was a daft thing to do. So! What a silly cunt! Hahaha - fuck her.

There is an alternative: keep your shitty opinion to yourself, perhaps, and consider being empathetic.

No-one has to, of course, but then again neither do I have to therefore not tell them I think they're gits.

As for the rest: I'll pull any number of possibilities out of my arse to demonstrate the issues with those who say ""omg  what a fuckwit"" and you'll still miss the point and continue to be a condescending, contrary prick.

As /u/sennalvera says, [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is very good for getting into some quite in-depth maths. I'm not sure what level they start at - if I recall correctly it's fairly basic, but hopefully isn't too intimidating.

The BBC have [BBC Bitesize](http://www.bbc.co.uk/education) - covering from KS1 through GCSE (and possibly higher). I've not tried it, but I've just taken a quick look and it might be useful. Don't get frustrated too quickly, stick with it, and go back a level if you need to.

I hope that's of some use - if you ever have specific questions, there's probably an appropriate place on Reddit to ask. If you can't find one, try posting it somewhere inappropriately!

As it happens I live in an area with a sizeable ethnic minority population, many of whom are Muslim and occasionally you'll hear tourists or newly arrived students expressing fear because of it. It totally baffles me, this idea that the Shia Iranians and the Sunni Somalis and the Ahmadi Pakistanis are going to join forces suddenly and take over. It's every bit as absurd as thinking that the Christians attending the Roman Catholic Church and the Christians attending the Greek Orthodox Church have secret conspiracy meetings, just because they all believe in Jesus' divinity. 

To illustrate how not scary my local Muslim community is, my Muslim neighbours celebrated Christmas day by attending a Christmas dinner event at the local Sikh temple. This is how we were all brought up, it doesn't matter what religion you are, everyone just mixes together, any one who tried to pull any divisive fundamentalist nonsense would just be laughed out of town. 

Edit - minor correction, the Christmas dinner thing was at the Sikh temple, not the Hindu one. The moral of the story remains the same.

Ok. Can you do so - give me your actual opinion on the subject at hand. But again, you have completely missed the point James was making.

&gt;You then ask a complete non sequitor about Muslims and tell me that I am apparenty unwilling to answer it,

Well, rather than my opinion on cheese, this is absolutely relevant to the subject at hand.

I asked you the question in order to prompt you to give your own opinion, thus to explore the ridiculousness of the subject further.

For instance, you might have said:

""I don't expect an apology, but here are the ways in which Muslims might be best approaching the topic""

Or

""The question is ill formed because it implies the following incorrect, presupposed falacies""

Or

""Yes, in a way I do expect them to apologise for the following reasons""

But I do agree the question itself is ridiculous from the point of view of a straight yes or no - and I have explained why his line of questioning was ridiculous (it was so on purpose), and that he also tried to make a serious point. The whole point here is to open up the dialogue, however you seem intent on closing it down.

You know Reddit isn't real-time, right? I don't require immediate answers and seeing as I have no way of knowing your or indeed anyone's daily schedule I tend to assume people may not get back to me immediately.

I see you have no interest in a respectful conversation and rather than even talk about the question at hand, or your opinion on it, you would rather get caught up in the semantics of James Brian's approach and when all else fails turn to insults.

Going to give learning programming a go.  Might as well.  But if I find I enjoy it, it's going to take years before I'm suitable for a work environment.  

But how do I (and others) afford (both time and money) to skill up to get these jobs that require highly skilled jobs without many years of study.   These jobs will require years of hard study.  For that you need a firm idea that you want to study that subject and the dedication to stick it out.

I never went to uni.  I was scared of fees and had zero idea what I wanted to do, I still don't.  I just get by, nothing has taken my interest enough to drop thousands of pounds and hours on training.  But whatever I chose to do, it's going to take years of study just to get to a base level.

Each small square on the grid measures 2"" by 2"", the larger squares are 6"" by 6"".  I only used the square layout to give me an idea of how to lay it out.  When I cut out the quilt I combined the measurements to give me large pieces.  For example the inner door panels were cut as 6.5"" by 8.5"" squares (1/4"" seam allowance all around).  I might be able to provide more cutting instructions if you can give me a few days.

I guess I fall on the 'free speech, even if it is offensive' side of the debate.

What about calling David Cameron a punt (replace the letter) on twitter? Seems a legitimate opinion to hold, to me - is that permissible?

In my experience working with a Highways department, the council would not allow this to be sited on the public highway unless they provided the sign.

Who is responsible for the cleaning and upkeep of the sign? The council would do this if it's their sign but if it's not on their worklist,  the contractors would soon report it back to the highways officers who would remove it.

Who would be liable if a car crashes into the pole or lighting column and the sign comes loose and injures someone? The council would very easily prove they gave no permission for this to be sited, but that's still money and time taken from fixing potholes or streetlights.

Please do not just go about erecting signs because they meet your interpretation of what constitutes a hazard. Highways departments are made up of staff that live locally to you and understand your issues. I know officers fighting against housing development proposals because of the impact on the local parking.

Go through this department and if they say no, speak to your councillors or MP.  Speak to your Road Safety Partnership and ask for the data on accident rates on your road or ask them to do an average speed survey.

But, we could also make top up payments that give people access to improved services. These could range from basic things like next day/short notice GP access, faster non-urgent referrals etc. to more comprehensive things like maybe private companies would provide advanced services like routine MRI cancer screening... Obviously things like that would come at a significant cost.

We probably need to move away from the current model that treats everyone equally irrespective of ability to pay. I realise saying that is like heresy against the very doctrine of the NHS.

Alternatively, parking on campus is charged at £1 per hour, though if you're lucky there's about six spots opposite Heslington Church Field which let you stay free for two hours, or did last I checked anyway. 

As far as parking nearby goes, afraid there isn't really anywhere nearby that isn't permit-only parking, exactly to stop non-residents from parking there. The closest I can think of is probably [Newland Park Drive](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Newland+Park+Dr,+York+YO10/@53.951642,-1.0570079,18z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x487931cc7fa885ed:0xcf1c1714bbcdb9c5), which is convenient if your interview is in Alcuin, Vanbrugh or Wentworth Colleges, but not so much if it's in Derwent, Heslington Hall or indeed Heslington East. If it is on Hes East, I'd recommend parking up in [B&amp;Q](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/B%26Q/@53.9542005,-1.0277235,17z/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1zQiZR!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0xdbf87a6d3b7d2958), it's about a five minute walk away.

We don't have a big enough group of players to play all the games in front of us in January, let alone the rest of the season, and keep any kind of quality control or consistent style of play going on.

Buying in Jan makes a huge statement about Levy's faith in Poch (considering he only gave him table scraps in the summer), whilst also being true to our actual ambitions of a side that wants to be in the UCL conversation and challenge for Cups.

What upsets me is that we're trying to avoid more job cuts next year by starting a private practice to provide some of the things that our NHS service is too stretched to provide.  So instead of providing the most effective (but resource intensive) treatments, we give a substandard version and then offer people the chance to pay to have the full version.  It's justified by us saying that we couldn't provide the full version under any circumstances, so if people are going to go private then they might as well go private with the same therapist in a building rented from the NHS.

With Sturridge coming back and Balotelli starting to look a lot more tactically astute lately, in addition to Sterling being able to play as a forward, I would make a keeper out number 1 priority and spend every penny of the winter budget if needed on a new one.  I don't know who is available, but we need a keeper who is a very vocal, commanding presence at the back who will control his area and attack the ball on set pieces, as well as good distributing from the back.  

While it's not a realistic target at all (Leverkusen would be insane to sell him, plus there's no reason why he'd want to come here instead of Leverkusen given the current situations at both clubs), I think Bernd Leno is really the best example of what we're looking for.  He's young and promising which fits FSG's archetype, but he's also a monster in the air on set pieces and has good feet on him.

But the tuition fees are high, and so you rarely get Americans from low socio-economic backgrounds coming here.

Chelsea game aside, we just haven't been playing well.  You could count the number of good halves we've played on one hand.  Koeman this season and Martinez last season have both proved that you can be new at a mid-table club and burst out of the gates well.  They're obviously the exception rather than the rule, but sitting on our current hand as though it's enough is patently naive at this point.  We've narrowly missed out on 4th in recent seasons when a simple January purchase of a striker, CM or CB would've been enough to make the difference.

What you are saying about legislation and morality is part of an even wider debate in legal philosophy: To what extent does or should the law relate to morality? It is a challenging area as well, and a lot of human rights notions have a tendency to raise these concerns particularly for their very vagueness -- yet this vagueness is effectively the strength as well as the curse. 

The important thing to bare in mind is context. So while people commonly speak about a right to be offensive, even in the most free speech inclined countries (e.g. the US) there are rules about protecting the 'public order' and preventing 'unrest' or people getting hurt, panics created etc. (similar to the idea of breach of the peace; or running in to a library and shouting 'fire' -- this is illegal, it serves no constructive purpose and what's more is dangerous). 

So while you have every right to [freely to express an insult at David Cameron over Twitter](http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Prime-Minister-David-Cameron-abused-person/story-21102105-detail/story.html), there are lines to be drawn e.g. it would be unwise to run at him in the street, flailing your arms and expressing the same insult repeatedly, or maybe even spam his Twitter account with insults from just your one account. If you met him at the pub and gave him your opinion as you've written, you would be well within your rights. 

Insults, opinions, words, parodies are rarely *in and of themselves* illegal. Context is key, but also muddies the water. ",null,0,null,1421012707,null,0,1421019687,0,cnlu0wc,null,t3_2rst5v,null,t1_cnlu0wc,null,t1_cnlrbku,null,null,null,1424931714,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Climate change is not a matter of necessity spurring invention. The technological solutions are available *right now*, and in fact have been for some time. The problem arises from politics and economics. 

The results of climate change could easily be sufficient to set our knowledge back a long way. Even without ongoing catastrophe, knowledge is lost all the time. You mention the Apollo program; if we wanted to launch equivalent missions today - that is, not do anything new, but simply repeat what already happened - many years of work, at great expense, would be required to rediscover the knowledge that has been lost.

null,false,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,null,"Your problem is very apparent: you don't have a clue where your money is going. You're spending money without regard for it. Taking out another loan won't solve this problem... it will make it worse. Your outstanding loans aren't a problem -- they're the symptom -- your problem is irresponsibility.

You need to start a budget immediately and accept responsibility for your finances. The fact that you have calculated you have ~£1000 per month to ""play with"" if you don't have debt should clearly indicate to you that you have more than enough money to service your debts if you approach this issue seriously and you **do not** need to take on more debt. Consolidation loans are almost always a mistake.

Step 1. Start a budget (do this TODAY, forget everything else until you have done this)

Step 2. Quit all non-essential expenditure until your debts are paid (if it isn't a bill and it isn't essential to your existence, don't do it. That means no buying coffee or a big mac, buy the cheapest food and eat every meal cooked at home). If you have bills due between now and when you get paid (that you can't afford): **phone them** and explain you need an extra week or 2 to pay. Ask your employer if they can offer an advance on your income. Prioritise bills: council tax is very important, your TV license isn't, same with your phone bill (they will offer a month or so grace period before they cut you off). 

Step 3. Don't borrow any more money until you are responsible enough to manage it

http://youneedabudget.com is software that can help.

Step 4, by the way, is build an emergency fund. Even when your debts are paid you **cannot** go back to how you are now, stick to your budget and build an emergency fund. Then when you have 3 - 6 months of expenses (~£2400) you can start considering spending on *nice* things again.",null,0,null,1421013937,null,0,1421015165,0,cnlurfx,null,t3_2s3kvw,null,t1_cnlurfx,null,t3_2s3kvw,null,null,null,1424931370,null,22,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,22,null

But I think the depth of quality in our side is extremely shallow.  You've said below that it's ""impossible"" than Bentaleb and Mason should have more quality than our other options (which also include a Brazilian international and one of Ligue 1's best CDMs from two seasons ago in Capoue), but I point to the fact that they are easily our best pairing this season as a sign of how poor our squad is.  It's not like Mason and Nabil are the second coming of Pogba and Vidal.  They're not barnstormingly brilliant and undroppable... they're just not as dire as everyone else in their position.

I'd argue that we don't even have enough quality players to fill a single starting XI, let alone have enough for squad rotation to help us survive what will be a very punishing month and rest of the season.  Poch has already shown he has a very shallow playing roster he's willing to trust (Kaboul, Lennon, Naughton, Chiriches, Paulinho, Soldado and Ade are only ever utilised when strictly necessary), so why not help him out?  We're a good 4-6 players from having a complete roster of quality, so why wait til the summer to do all the work?  We tried that once already and look how that turned out.  Buying two good players now puts out a statement of intent, gives us a realistic chance of actually getting something from this season, and prevents having to integrate a whole bunch of new players all at the same time at the start of the next campaign.  Every season can't be a rebuilding one... we need to put some stakes in the ground, and now is a perfect time to do it.",null,0,null,1421014210,null,0,false,0,cnlux3m,null,t3_2s1ztb,null,t1_cnlux3m,null,t1_cnlhgwd,null,null,null,1424931296,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

The issue is that I feel that there is a huge game of 'tug of war' being played with the fans, the team and Harry redknapp. We have a brilliant home record, undoubtably good for a team that is fighting for survival, but we cannot take anything from an away game? We spend and spend and change and change, but still cannot find a solution. We get excited at prospects in Vargas, Sandro and Taarabt. Then we get thrown some media bullshit b/w HR and Taarabt, before him being selected for a HUGE game against Burnley, a game that can restore form and optimism about our future. HR is never questioned about the tactics behind our play and always provides general comments that have been stated a million times already. We bring in Rio and Vargas, for them to be replaced by Zamora and Dunne. We get rid of Simpson, whilst being short for cover.

All I have to say is that I can understand fans frustration, as I have had a bad feeling in my stomach since the Burnley game which will probably last until we are out of the relegation zone. I appreciate what HR has done. Yes we have an expensive team, yes on paper we should be winning games left, right and centre, but he has sorted this team out. HR is not very inspiring, which is what QPR lack right now in management as TF, a man I look to for positivity, is in a world of his own. Maybe HR should be looking at retirement by the end of the year or sooner, not because he isn't necessarily good as a manager, but he seems out of sorts in terms of passion and inspiration.

We just need take a breather, and really look at getting 3 points with the players we have, not taking relying on loans to get us over the line.

Start on Stoke Road on Durdham Downs, go past Wills Hall to the northwestern viewpoint above the Gorge. Head south through the trees and across Ladies Mile to the Zoo. Wander down Pembroke Road or College Road to the Catholic Cathedral, then west towards the suspension bridge.

First coffee stop is in Clifton Village: Boston Tea Party is popular, but somewhere more tucked away like the Albion or downstairs at The Mall is good for a bite to eat too.

Next head through Victoria Square onto Brandon Hill. Hit up Cabot Tower if it's a clear day to see a great view, then come down Park Street and across College Green to the Harbourside. Take a seat on the harbour by the Arnolfini, or in Queen Square.

Walk up Welsh Back and through St Nicholas Market to Christmas Steps. There are some good art galleries and a huge video shop here, take a look. Next climb up through the university campus to the gardens on the hill. Stop for a rest and check out the view, then head down Cotham Hill to Clifton Down train station. This is a cool part of Bristol: for £1.50 (if the conductor even comes round) you'll get to Montpelier station.

Walk up to St Andrews Park for the second coffee. If it's a nice day there will be a kiosk, if not you can pop to one of the dozen coffeeshops on Gloucester Road. It's nice to sit in St Andrews Park and watch the dogs run around.

Now get onto Gloucester Road and head south, through the Arches and down Cheltenham Road to Stokes Croft. There are some great little shops on this route, have a look in some of them. Check out the arty places in Stokes Croft especially.

From there you can either walk or get a bus down to North Street in Southville, which is worth a look, then walk north across Spike Island to see the S.S. Great Britain or M Shed. On a nice evening, head for a gig at the Grain Barge in Hotwells or dinner at Steak of the Art near At Bristol.",null,0,null,1421015948,null,0,false,0,cnlvx3z,null,t3_2runsj,null,t1_cnlvx3z,null,t3_2runsj,null,null,null,1424930759,null,1,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,1,null

null,false,DevilsCruelty,null,null,null,"The actual number of people going into A&amp;E over Christmas has't been outside the normal predicted numbers. The major problem is an overall system problem which has been dramatically exacerbated by government changes over the last few years.

Closing of Walk-in centres was originally supposed to be a massive easy way to cut cost. But what we have seen over the past few years, is that it hasn't, and actually cost more, because people come into A&amp;E and then get admitted if they sit there more than 4 hours. 

The new 95% targets were introduced across the country, which is especially hard over the winter months. This is made worse by the staffing issues that were highlighted in Stafford hospital a few years back. We suddenly had to have more staff, which has meant that hospitals spend a lot of money on agency and bank staff to work effectively as part time contractors earning £300+  a day.  

Another issue (which causes ""crisis's"" is the large number of elderly patients sitting in beds, that cant be discharged. This is due to a number of reasons. 

1. Aging infrastructure, the lack of spending in older hospitals in training and digital admin infrastructure is shockingly bad in many places. Care plans for patients aren't properly sorted (Electronic Discharge Summary). So they can't go home. 

2. The lack of co-operation working with social services. People don't want to pay extra staff to get someone out of hospital and into their home (whether that be private/nhs care home or social housing) because then social care have to pay for it out of their budget. So patients sit in hospital for 2- 30 days longer than needed, just because they cant leave. 

These two points above cause the majority of the backlog issues with waiting in A&amp;E, beds and costs of simply having a patient sitting in the hospital. 

The lack of antibiotics isn't anything to do with many hospitals current crisis within A&amp;E.
Aging population has some small part to play though. The fact people are spending in hospitals with chronic illnesses is increasing, but more and more is being put into primary care situations (like your GP practice or Community Hospital) to deal with the variety of patient care outside of hospital. 

Yes people are stupid and go to A&amp;E, but that isn't the cause or an issue. Its a scapegoat for MP's and ""Experts"" to claim on TV while staring at their huge investments into Private Healthcare as people feel less confident in the NHS. 

The NHS is a highly complex machine, and i have barely scratched the surface of the problems my colleges are currently working with.

His defence isn’t that he didn’t do what is alleged; but rather that what he did do should not be classed as rape. The law, however, is what the law is; not what criminals think it should be.

Well that's a ridiculous appeal to authority fallacy. 

This case is entirely down to the opinion of the jury, so to talk like it's gospel and can't be argued with is quite unbelievable. 

&gt;The only aspect that is in dispute is that Ched Evans says that the victim consented to have sex with him while the prosecution allege that the victim was too drunk to consent.

""the only aspect""  It's a pretty fucking important part of it. 


The entire reason they say Evans is guilty of rape is because the jury decided she was too drunk to consent.

&gt;In this case, the woman went to the hotel with Clayton McDonald and video footage showed that she appeared to do so willingly. This does not prove that she consented – but the jury aren’t asked to decide whether or not there is proof that she consented (is there was, the judge would have stopped the case before the jury were asked to reach a decision). But it might well be sufficient to cast reasonable doubt as to whether or not there was consent – particularly as the victim had no recollection of what happened.

&gt;But such a doubt does not arise with Evans. The victim did not go back to the hotel with him. The text message (From McDonald, not the victim) merely said that McDonald had “got a bird” – not that the “bird” was inviting Evans to join them. Evans lied to the receptionist to get a key to the room. He didn’t knock the room door and wait to be invited in; but he let himself into the room where (if you accept his version) he must have known that sex was likely to be taking place. 


So basically because the jury can't prove she consented to the second guy, he's guilty. The first guy was lucky he had video evidence, otherwise he'd be charged with raping the woman who drank too much and couldn't remember what happened.

In that short time span she managed to consent to one guy and be perfectly fine to remember she left he handbag in the taxi, but then become so drunk she couldn't be capable of consent.

That's just it though. They could have been better. Like I said, there were a number of times in the match Dembele was supposed to press the opposition with Eriksen, but instead only partially committed to it. I also remember a number of times he was caught out on the left side of the field, when he should have been tracking back to his right CM position. 

Re: Stambouli, how many times did he try to out dribble an opposition player when the smart move would have been to pass it forward? That again points to a lack of concentration on the job at hand as rather than focus on his role in the system, he chose instead to do his own thing.

As far as skill goes, I may not agree with your point about passing skills, but I will agree with the point about vision. However they are currently our best fit considering the options available. Having said that, even if they're not the ideal fit, the minimum we should expect is for them to concentrate on their jobs.

&gt;The __Ulster Defence Association__ (__UDA__) is the largest   [Ulster loyalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_loyalism) [paramilitary and vigilante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_loyalism#Paramilitary_and_vigilante_groups)  group in [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland). It was formed in September 1971 and [undertook a campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Ulster_Defence_Association_actions) of almost twenty-four years during [The Troubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles). Within the UDA was a group tasked with launching paramilitary attacks; it used the covername __Ulster Freedom Fighters__ (__UFF__) so that the UDA would not be outlawed. The United Kingdom outlawed the ""UFF"" in November 1973, but the UDA itself was not [classified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proscription) as a [terrorist group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorist_group) until 10 August 1992.

Well yeah, I get that, but that doesn't actually mean anything in the real world. The British monarchy is irrelevant in the context of NI. 

Nationalists/republicans don't give a shit what type of government Britain has, they want an independent, united Irish Republic. For how long England, Scotland and Wales keep the monarchy is totally disconnected to the issue of reunification.

Aside from that, Britain would be governed the same whether it had an elected head of state or a family of subsidised celebrities, so basing an entire ideology around it seems a bit retarded. Especially so since Britain doesn't look like it'll become a republic anytime soon.

Sure the *scholarships* are difficult and very competitive. But actual entrance is not (the SAT is really not much harder than GCSE standard, and the essays they ask you to write are pretty simple too). The competition for international scholarships are just as high if not higher at Oxbridge.

I wouldn't expect the south to take on our nhs..the pound as well as a currency could be a reason for staying so much so the Scottish independence movement valued keeping it over the euro. The UK having oil also doesn't hurt why I would choose to stay in the uk either.

Those are pretty sound reasons. I personally won't consider reunification until I have reliable trust the south can afford the NHS which imo must not be lost, the instability of the Euro is another reason. The republic of Ireland had to be bailed out because of it..why would I risk a economically safer currency for one that in my opinion is too unstable.

I wouldn't see it as morally right to force the cost of the nhs over the south either because it would be the south footing the bill on the nhs and those citizen's get taxed as it is without subsidizing us. We are already dead weight in the uk as it is as far as getting a profit out and its not right on the southern citizens. That and the fact the troubles will probably restart with loyalist paramilitaries wanting  reunification with the uk and the republican paramilitaries fighting against..and the citizens of the republic do not deserve our messed up fighting and if the British army and ruc  had trouble with it I dare say so will the republics police and military will have trouble and people will die.

I haven't seen one person pro reunification give me a satisfactory answer to the NHS or currency question. Until I can be satisfied I will be pro union simply because I feel the NHS and currency are worth it.

I don't care about the monarchy and im by no means a patriot but I would prefer economic safety and a world class health service  ( one a bit more better run and out of the hands of the dup )over something more unforeseeable.

Lamela on the other hand gets given more time as he has suffered injuries and been down the pecking order at other times and as such I can hold back on judgement longer. 17 games last season, 9 in league. I am beginning to judge Lamela though, he's had enough time, I'd like to see signs of his game develloping.

As I think I said in a previous comment there really are 2 things here 1) should a rapist be allowed to be a footballer and 2) was ched evan's conviction fair. 

You should read [this](http://footylaw.co.uk/2015/01/06/ched-evans-sifting-facts-from-fiction/) by the way, best explaination of the state of play I've seen, very factual, completely unbiased and very informative. Basically there's nothing wrong with the justice system, based on the law, as it stands he is a rapist, everyone agrees with that, I don't think even Ched disagrees with that, what he is fighting for is to change the law, so that being ""too drunk to consent"" is not a thing. 

I do think there is an issue here, being ""too drunk to consent"" implies passed out drunk unable to really talk/move/form coherent sentences but if someone just starting having sex with them they wouldn't try to stop them due to overwhelming drunkness. In that case I think most people would agree, that's fucking rape, no question there!

Frankly, it’s just risible, hysterical third-rate journalism.  Everywhere one looks now in the mainstream media, Rolf Harris is referred to as “a convicted paedophile”. Several columnists have used the same descriptor for Dave Lee Travis and Stuart Hall.  All of these slurs are medically inaccurate, and will I think in the fullness of time be proved completely false on every other dimension. Jimmy Savile did not groom a nation, because such an achievement is palpably physically impossible. Cliff Richard was not at Elm House. Paul Gambacinni is not and never has been an abuser of under-ageboys, or a fan of group sex with rough trade.
